The fiscal policy strategy announced inBudget 2003 aimed at strengthening the fiscal consolidationprocess, which began in2002.In pursuing its commitment tofiscal prudence, and greater transparency and accountabirity infiscal affairs, the government brought in the FiscalManagement (Responsibility) Acr (FMRA) ar end 2002. ThisAct requires the overall fiscal deficit to be reduced to 5 per centof GDP by 2006 and maintained below that level the'eafter'. Italso requires the goveffrment to reduce the debt to GDp ratioto 85 per cent by 2006 and further to 60 per cenr by 2013, Inline with these medium-term fiscal targets, Budget 2003announced measures to increase revenue, contain expenditureand improve debt management in order to cap the overalldeficit at7 .5 per cent of GDP and to reverse the rising trend inthe government debt to GDP ratio in 200i. Further, the threeyear fiscal l'ramework announced in Budget 2003 indicatedbroad fiscal aggregates and a deficit reduction path consistentwith the fiscal targets envisaged under the FMRA and thegovernment's medium-term economic strategy contained in thePoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSp).The medium-term fiscal consolidation programme aims atimproving fiscal operations in several ways, while supportingthe development of the economy. The deficit is expected to bereduced gradually with better revenue performance and therationalisation of recunent expenditure. The allocation of tundsfor public investment is expected to be increased to improvephysical infrastructure and human capital for acceleratedgrowth momentum. It expects to transform the governmentfiom the single largest dis-saver to the largest single saver inthe economy and increase funds for public investment withconcessional foreign sources and government revenue. The roleof the govemment in the economy is expected to shift fromdirect participation in economic activity to a regulatory role,allowing the private sector to play a dominant role.Government dependence on the domestic market to finance theresources gap is expected to be reduced, limiting pressure onthe domestic market and releasing more funds tor privaternvestment.",

The completion of theprivatisation of sri Lanka Insurance corporation (SLIC) andthe sale of 100 petrol stations and one third of the common userfacility of the cPC, together with the leasing of the oil tankfarm in Trincomalee were two major programmes completedin 2003. with the privatisation of sLIC, the government movedout almost entilely fiom the insurance business leaving it in thehands of the private sector to be developed on marketprinciples. The process to select a third player fbr the petroleumindustry continued. with the completion of this programme, thegovernment owned cPC will compete with two private playersin the retail petroleum market. Initial measures were taken tounbundle the main activities of the CEB, i.e. generation,tlansmission and distribution, under the Electricity Refbrm Act.In addition, PERC has identified several public enterprises tobe divested in the future. The two major restructuringprogrammes launched outside PERC were the reform of the sriLanka Railways, converting its functions fi'om a departmentalenterprise to an Authority and the restructuring of the cwE toimprove its commercial viability. A comprehensiverestructuring programme was introduced in 2003 to improvethe service delivery of the cwE and to solve its outstandingdebt burden, to avoid burdening the government budget withthe need to subsidise the cwE. The government took over apart of the CWE's liabilities to the banking system by issuingTreasury bonds amounting to Rs.4.4 billion. In turn, rear estateowned by CWE was transfemed to the gover-nment, which willbe divested to settle the liabilities transferred to thegovernment. In addition, a 40 per cent stake of the retailnetwork and the management was sold to the private sector, toinfuse private sector skills through private-public sectorparticipation. PERC and the Department of public Enterprisesjointly worked together to refbrm several selected enterprisesin 2003. Under this programme, a separate programme wasintroduced to merge 4 enterprises, to restructure and reform 5lcolporations and enterprises. Finally, l5 public enterpriseswere earmarked fbr liquidation after.thorough review, whichdemonstrated that these institutions did not contribute much tothe general public.",

As in 2002, governmentcontinued the policy of replacing high cost debt and retiringnon-marketable debt. Funds required fbr this purpose wereraised through rreasury bonds. The most notable developmentin 2003 was the extension of the maturity structure of rreasurybonds. The sharp decline in the resource requirement from thedomestic market, improved liquidity and the significantreduction in interest rates created an envilonment conducive forthe government to increase the maturity structure of Treasurybonds gradually from 6 year to 20 years. This helped toestablish a benchmark yield curve upto 20 years, a long f'eltneed to develop the long-term secondary market in domesticdebt. The completion of the preparatory work fbr the ScriplessSecurities settlement System (ssss) for government securitieswas another major development that would improve secondarymarket activity in govelnment debt. The SSSS commencedoperations in eally 2004.The policy of developing the PD system was continued in2003. Accoldingly, the number of pDs operating in thegovernment securities market was incr.eased fr.om l0 to I l. inaddition, the government has decided to set up a Special RiskReserve Fund by transt'erring a par.t of the after tax profits ofPDs. This Fund would promote the safety, soundness and thestability of the PD system and build up rhe pD capital base. Theminimum capital requirement of PDs was raised to Rs.400million fiom Rs.200 million. That minrmum is expected to beraise to Rs.450 million befbre mid-2005, in order to improvethe resilience of the PD system. The minimum subscriptionlevel of PDs at Treasury bill/bond auctions was reduced to l0per cent from l5 per cent. The firm two way quote (bid andoff'er plices) requirement tbr selected benchmark maturitieswas expanded to promote the liquidity of the medium and long-term market.

Despite slippages in revenue, significantreductions in expenditure enabled the government to lower theovelall deficit.

However, the realised deficit was still 0.5 per centof GDP higher than the original target of 7,5 per cent of GDpin Budget 2003.Inability to arrest the decline in the tax/GDpratio was responsible fbr this deviation, indicating the ur-gentneed to reverse the declining trend to achieve the fiscalconsolidation targets wrthin the stipulated time frameenvisaged under the FMRA.Following improved fiscal operations, the primary deficit,which reflects the impact of the cunent year's fiscal operationson the macroeconomy, and the cument account deficit, whichmeasures the level of government dis-savings, both improvedconsiderably in 2003. Consequent to measures introduced tocontain non-interest recurrent expenditure and non-prioritycapital expenditure, the primary deficit declined to 0.9 per centof GDP, the second consecutive year of decline. Following thesame trend, the cun'ent account detlcit decreased for the secondyear, to 3.3 per cent of GDP. This improvement in governmentdis-savings was the outcome of a reduction in both interest costand non-interest recurrent expenses. The primaLy deficrtdecreased more than the cunent account deficit due to a fasterdecline in non-interest recurrent expenditure. However, theimprovement in these fiscal aggregates was below target dueto a significant shortfall in tax revenue.The public sector deficit, which is the combined defrcit ofthe genelal government and public non-financial corporations,declined to I .9 per cent of GDP. An improved perfbrmance onthe part of public non-flnancial corporations (a deficit reductionof 0.1 per cent of GDP) also contributed to the overallimprovement.

However, expenditure overruns insome departmental enter.prises, e.g., Railway and postaldepartments, and flood related expenses nullified some of thebenefits. Accordingly, non-interest recurrent expendituredropped by 1.6 per cenr of GDp to ll.9 per cent of GDp in2003. This improvement was further strengthened by theleduction in interest expenditure. Interest rates in the domesticmarket f'ell further than expected. Government r.eplaced highcost debt with low cost debt. Both these developments helpedlower the interest cost in 2003. Total recurrent expendituredeclined by 1.9 per cent of GDp to 19.0 per cent of GDp in2003. During the last two years, the reduction in non-interestrecun'ent expenditure, as a ratio of GDp, has been about 3 percent' This improvement shows the possibility of furthercontainment of non-interest recurent expenditure in areas suchas defence, transfer payments to departmental enterprises, civilservlce expenses and welfare programmes. In addition, prudentdebt management with the development of the debt marketwould help to continue the downward trend in the interest cost/GDP ratio, which commenced in 2003. Further improvementsIn lecurrent expenditure are essential to achieve the medium-term tiscal consolidation targets envisaged under the FMRA.The government's investment policy adopted in 2002 wascontinued in 2003. In view of the availability of donor fundsand the limited availability of domestic resources, the publicrnvestment programme in 2003 was designed to absorb themaxrmum available project related concessional donor funds,while limiting locally funded projects to priority sectors withhigh returns. As a result, total public investment expenditurein Budget 2003 was kept at 5.3 per cent of GDp as in Budget2002' The 'ealised public investment programme shows thatthe government was unable to complete the annual investmentplans tbr 2003. Although foreign resource utilisation rateimproved significantly to over 20 per cent in 2003 fLom t4 percent in 2002, resource constraints on the domestic frontcompelled the authorities to curtail the release of funds forlocally funded projects. The slippages in revenue coilection andthe commitment to minimise the deviation from the overalldeficit under the medium-term fiscal strategy were the mainfactors, which restricted the issue of funds for publicinvestment. consequently, public investment in 2003 amountedto 5 per cent of GDP, 0.3 percentage points lower than theoriginal target. However, the realised programme was amalginal improvement over the public investment of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2002.The current level of public investment is far below whatis required to accelerate growth to over 6-8 per cent in themedium term or to encourage private investment. However,the government faces difficulties in increasing publicinvestment through local funding, as high domestic bonowing",

Therefore,every effort needs to be made to raise the maximum possibleamount of concessional donor funding for public investment.The balance funding requirement must be met from revenuesources, to avoid the negative impact of high governmentdomestic borrowing on the overall economy. This reiteratesthe need to strengthen the revenue performance of thegovernment.In financing the budget deficit, government's r.eliance onthe domestic malket was significantly reduced to 4.5 per centof GDP in 2003. Externalresources available for the financingof budgetary operations increased sharply in 2003. Totalexternal funds for budgetary financing (loans and grants)reached a historical high of US dollars I billion (gross receipts)compared to US dollars 630 million in2002. The privatisationprogramme performed lelatively better in 2003. With theseimprovements, the government's borrowing requir-ement fi-omdomestic sources dropped to the lowest level since 1997.The sharp increase in fbreign aid utilisation in 2003 wasone of the major developments that contributed to improvedperfolmance in the fiscal sector as well as other sectors in theeconomy. Gross resources available fl-om external sources fbrfinancing budgetary operations amounted to Rs,96 billion,including Rs.88 billion of loans and Rs.8 billion of grants. Totaldisbursements included fbreign programme loans of uS dollars244 milhon (Rs.23.5 billion) received from multilateral andbilateral donors and US dollaL 100 million (Rs.9.5 billion) ti-omNEXI of Japan. On a net basis, external resources available fbrfinancing the budget amounted to Rs.5l billion (Rs,43 billionloans and Rs.8 billion grants). As most of these funds areconcessional, the burden of servicing these debts would be low.Priority needs to be given to maintaining this higher utilisationof concessional external funding for budgetary opelations, asit will serve multiple objectives such as increasing publicinvestment, lowering the borrowing pressur.e in the domesticmarket and increasing the country's reserves,The privatisation pl'ogramme in 2003 was close to thetarget. Proceeds fiom privatisation brought in Rs,l0.2 billioncompared to Rs,l3,5 billion envisaged in Budget 2003, Theprivatisation of SLIC realised Rs.6 billion. A parr paymenr ofRs. 2.7 billion received for budgetery operations from the saleof one hundred petrol stations and one third of the common userfacility of CPC in 2003. The sale of 40 per cenr of rhe rerailoutlets of CWE, and the sale of the government's balance shareholding in plantation companies, hotels, banks and otherprivatised enterprises generated the balance of Rs.l.5 billion.Higher receipts from external sources and the privatisationprogramme, as well as the reduction in the total resource gaphelped to lower borrowing in the domestic market in 2003.Accordingly, resources mobilised tr-om domestic sourcesdeclined to 4.5 per cent of GDP (Rs.80 billion) in comparisonto 8 per cent of GDP (Rs,126 billion) in 2002.In 2003, the govemment was able to reduce its liabilitiesto the banking system for the second consecutive year.

However, higherrevenue collection from the withholding tax helped offset partof the shoLtfall in corporate and personal income taxes.The corporate income tax/GDp ratio in 2003 was 0.9 percent as in2002. Although the Advanced Company Tax (ACT)was abolished fiom 2002, companies could set off any previousACT paid against their cunent year's tax liability. Similarly,even though the investment allowance was abolished,unclaimed balances that could be set off when calculatingtaxable income are still available to companies that have madelarge capital investments in the past, reducing the corporate taxcollection flom these institutions. Tax collection from largetaxpayers increased during 2003,while corporate tax collectionfrom small and medium taxpayers decreased significantly. Thecorporate tax collection from the banking, insurance andtelecommunication sectors also decreased during 2003. Thismay be due to higher provisioning in the banking sector andthat investment in the telecommunication sector were eligiblefor investment allowances. Meanwhile, the corporate incometax rate for companies with taxable income of over Rs.5 millionper annum was reduced to 30 per cent from 35 per cent, but 50per cent of this tax cut, r.e.,2.5percent, was to be piaced in aHuman Resources Endowment Fund (HREF). public quotedcompanies, with 300 or more members and taxable incomeover Rs,5 million per annum, was to be taxed at 30 per cent ofwhich 2.5 per cent would be credited to the HREF. However,as this Fund has not yet been established the colrection for theHREF was transferred to the consolidated fund for budgetarypurposes. The tax concessions and exemptions granted inBudget 2002 and Budget 2003 have also reduced the tax base,resulting in lower tax collection. The tax amnesty also mayhave contributed to lower collections from corporate taxes.Personal income tax too declined significantly in 2003.The increase of the threshold from Rs.144,000 to Rs.240.000",

The increase came mainlyfrom witholding tax on interest earnings from governmentsecurities, which accounted tor 77 per cent of the totalcollection. The increase of marketable securities with longermaturities could be cited as the main reason for this.Meanwhile, the tax free limit on interest income under the l0per cent withholding tax was raised tiom Rs.72,000 per annumto Rs.108,000 per annum tiom I January 2003.Revenue from consumption taxes declined to 10.9 per centof GDP in 2003 from ll.6 per cent of GDP in 2002. Thedecline was in both taxes on domestic goods and services andon imports. The combined collection from GST, VAT and NSLof 6 per cent of GDP in 2002 fell to 5.5 per cent in 2003 undera unified VAT collection. The decline in the VAT collectionis partly attributed to the postponement of several measures tobroaden the VAT base, the operation of multiple VAT rates,administrative weaknesses in the collection mechanism and inthe refund mechanism. It was planned to extend the coverageof VAT to persons providing tlnancial services and to restrictthe input tax credit entitlement on assets acquired to be madeavailable on lease agreements to l0 per cent to broaden theVAT base and improve the net collection of taxes. However,implementation of these measures were delayed due to delaysin legislature. The practice of making refunds within one monthof the claims being submitted resulted in refunds being madewithout comprehensive audits being conducted, resulting inpossible overpayment, The proportion of refunds to total taxcollection increased significantly from 12per cent under GST",

The realised totalexpenditure, decreased to 23.7 per cent of GDp in 2003compared to 25.4 per cent in2002. This decrease came mainlyf}om a decline in recurrent expenditure, which amounted to l9per cent of GDP in 2003, as against 20.9 per cent in 2002. Asin previous years, the realised capital expenditure and netlending was below the annual target due to the curtailment ofnon priority rupee funded public investment and a shortfall inproject related fbreign resources.

However, lower interest faymentsand the containment of non-interest recurrent expenditurehelped reduce recurrent expenditure as a percentage of GDp,The reduction in interest payments was mainly due to a declinein market rates and reduced borrowing requirements. Thedecline in non-interest current expenditure was the outcome ofseveral factors. Expenditure on personal emoluments andpensron payments was contained by avoiding ad hoc salary andpension revisions in2002 and 2003, The continuation of theceasefire agreement contributed to containing defence relatedexpenditure. In addition, welfale payments and transfers topublic institutions were contained close to the budgeted level.However, there were expenditure overruns in departmentalenterprises and new expenditure on flood relief that offset partof the benefits achieved through other measures.In 2003, expenditure on salaries and wages, in nominalterms, increased marginally by 3 per cent, slightly higher thanthe budgeted level of Rs.9l billion. rn2002, the increase was17 per cent due to the full year impact of the salary increaseimplemented towards end 2001. salaries and wages declinedto 5.2 per cent of GDP fiom 5.6 per cent in 2002. This waspossible as a result of the continuation of the suspension ofrecruitment to the public sector, and the avoidance of ad hocsalary increases during 2003. salaries and wages remainedunchanged at27 per cent of recurrent expenditure.The signing of the peace agreement jn 2002 and thecontinuation of the peaceful environment throughout 2003enabled the government to contain def'ence related expenditure.Accordingly, defence expenditure (excruding expenditure onpublic order and saf'ety) declined in 2003.
