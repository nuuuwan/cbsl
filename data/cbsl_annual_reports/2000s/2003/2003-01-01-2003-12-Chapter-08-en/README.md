FISCAL POLICY AND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

8.1 Overview and Policy Strategy

Government continued in 2003 the policy strategy formulatedon the three principles introduced in Budget 2002, viz. reducepublic debt to a sustainable level, stimulate economic growthand increase employment opportunities and the earningcapacity of people to ensure sustained economic developmentover the medium-term. The fiscal policy strategy announced inBudget 2003 aimed at strengthening the fiscal consolidationprocess, which began in2002.In pursuing its commitment tofiscal prudence, and greater transparency and accountabirity infiscal affairs, the government brought in the FiscalManagement (Responsibility) Acr (FMRA) ar end 2002. ThisAct requires the overall fiscal deficit to be reduced to 5 per centof GDP by 2006 and maintained below that level the'eafter'. Italso requires the goveffrment to reduce the debt to GDp ratioto 85 per cent by 2006 and further to 60 per cenr by 2013, Inline with these medium-term fiscal targets, Budget 2003announced measures to increase revenue, contain expenditureand improve debt management in order to cap the overalldeficit at7 .5 per cent of GDP and to reverse the rising trend inthe government debt to GDP ratio in 200i. Further, the threeyear fiscal l'ramework announced in Budget 2003 indicatedbroad fiscal aggregates and a deficit reduction path consistentwith the fiscal targets envisaged under the FMRA and thegovernment's medium-term economic strategy contained in thePoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSp).The medium-term fiscal consolidation programme aims atimproving fiscal operations in several ways, while supportingthe development of the economy. The deficit is expected to bereduced gradually with better revenue performance and therationalisation of recunent expenditure. The allocation of tundsfor public investment is expected to be increased to improvephysical infrastructure and human capital for acceleratedgrowth momentum. It expects to transform the governmentfiom the single largest dis-saver to the largest single saver inthe economy and increase funds for public investment withconcessional foreign sources and government revenue. The roleof the govemment in the economy is expected to shift fromdirect participation in economic activity to a regulatory role,allowing the private sector to play a dominant role.Government dependence on the domestic market to finance theresources gap is expected to be reduced, limiting pressure onthe domestic market and releasing more funds tor privaternvestment.

The declining trend in the tax to GDp ratio is a matter forserious concern. It hampers the medium-term fiscal

consolidation process. It has been the main cause fbr highbudget deficits in the past. Since 1990, the ratio had declinedby 6 percentage poinrs of GDP to 13.2 per cent in 2003. Thisreduction is about Rs.l06 billion which is more than the publicsector wage bill or the public investment in 2003. Severalrevenue augmenting tax measures introduced over the lastdecade to reverse the declining trend have been ineffective.Cross country data show that the average tax to GDP ratio is38 per cent for developed countries and l8 per cent fordeveloping countries. Sri Lanka's tax effort has fallen far belowthe norm. This problem is a multi-faceted structural issue whichhas to be addressed through a comprehensive approachcorrecting tax policy, tax structure and tax administration andincentive systems, simultaneously.

An increase in revenue is expected to be the maincontributor to achieve the expected fiscal consolidation path.The VAT, introduced by unifying GST and NSL, has becomethe main revenue source and is expected to generate revenueclose to one half of tax receipts, A series of measures wereintroduced in 2003 to expand the VAT base and improve thenet collection. Among them were extending VAT to financialservices, correcting culrent weaknesses in the VAT refundmechanism and improving VAT administration. However,opposition to VAT, mainly due to poor public awareness,resulted in the postponement of some of the proposed policymeasures, including the extension of VAT to wholesale andretail trade, The income tax structure was further rationalisedby lowering the highest marginal tax rate from 35 per cent to30 per cent. In addition, a number of policy measures wereintroduced to increase indirect tax collection. The main cause

for the significant reduction in tanff revenue in the recent past

has been the exemption of a number of items from import duty.In view of the need to increase tax collection and to reducedistortions in the tax structure, a new tariff rate of 2 per cent

was imposed on most exempted impolts in Budget 2003. Thisrate was increased to 2.5 per cent after the Mid-Year FiscalReview to further strengthen tax collection in 2003. The excise

tax on liquor was streamlined by unifying total excise liabilitiesunder the Excise Ordinance. A Revenue Authority was to beestablished to improve tax administration. The delay in itsestablishment was a setback and this process needs to beexpedited with the cooperation of the existing revenuecollecting agencies.Tax evasion has been recognised as a serious problem and

successive governments offered tax amnesties on 9 occasionsbefore 2002 to bring tax evaders into the tax net. These tax

amnesties were generally unsuccessful. Because of the severedecline in the tax to GDP ratio and to avoid the weaknesses inprevious tax amnesties, the government granted a new tax

amnesty in2002, permitting tax evaders to enter the tax systemduring the period April2002 to August 2003. The amnestycovered taxes, duties, levies and penalties under 26 Acts.Declarants were entitled to immunity from liability to pay otherpenalties and from any other investigation or prosecution for

any off'ence under any of these 26 Acts. However, they wouldthereafter come within the tax net. Over 50,000 declarations

were received by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and interms of numbers registering, this tax amnesty was a success.However, the ultimate success depends on the etficiency of thetax authorities in collecting the pLoper tax liability f}om these

declarants in the future. As such, it is of utmost importance thatthe IRD design a new programme without any delay foreffective tax collection.The government recognises that reforms in tax policyshould be accompanied by reforms in tax administration asthese two are inextricably linked, Although tax policy has

undelgone a significant transformation in the past, reforms intax administration have been much slower and have not keptpace with the changes in the tax system and the economy.These tax collecting agencies launched a number of keymeasures in 2003. The Customs Department implemented

several programmes to improve the overall administration ofthe Department. The Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) waspartly implemented in 2003 and the full system will be inoperation in2004. The Gold Card Programme was introduced

as a pilot project, selecting large importers who would be givencustom clearance within a minimum time. In addition, theexisting valuation system was replaced by the WTO valuation

system with the objective of estimating the value of importedgoods at transactions value, which is the amount actually paidor payable for goods when sold for export to the country fordestination. Major reforms introduced by IRD include theamalgamation of the Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) tbr incometax with large VAT payers and the establishment of separate

audit units to carry out comprehensive audits on VAT andcorporate income taxes. The Department set up a special unitto monitor and enforce tax compliance. These administrativereforms are expected to implove efficiency in the collection oftax revenue.

On the expenditure side, considerable efforts have beenmade to contain recunent expenditure and rupee funded non-priority capital expenses, while encouraging the externallyfunded public investment programme. Expenditurerationalising measures introduced in2002 were continued in2003. To reduce the overall deficit in line with the medium-

term targets set out under the FMRA, expenditure policies were

fbrmulated to address short-term expenditure issues as well asto correct structural weaknesses in expenditure. Measures toreduce the overall expenditure in the short-run includedsuspending recruitment to the public sector (except forprof'essional and technical cadres), avoiding ad hoc generalwage and pension increases, streamlining the allocation offunds for defence services, better targetting welfareprogrammes, limiting allocation of funds for unforeseen andunclassified expenses and controlling funds for rupee fundednon-priority public investment programmes. New policiesintroduced to correct structural weaknesses in governmentexpenditure in the medium to long-term included theestablishment of an independent public debt managementoffice, reforming departmental enterprises and imposing limitson government guarantees under the FMRA. In addition,among the key measures continued in 2003 included thecontinuation of the contributoly pension scheme for newrecruits to the public service, designing an overall welfareprogramme under the Welfare Benefit Law and leformingpublic enterprises.To strengthen fiscal consolidation, a high level committee,the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility Monitoring

Committee, comprising senior offrcials from the public sectorwas appointed to ensure the implementation of structuralpolicies and maintenance of fiscal targets in the PovertyReduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) programme in 2003.The Committee has taken steps necessary to minimise

deviation from the original targets in Budget 2003.In addition,

several new measures were introduced during the second halfof the year to improve the fiscal operations as the Mid-yearFiscalPosition Report released under the FMRA indicated thatthere may be deviations from the fiscal target, mainly due toslippagds in revenue, However, the full benefit of some of thesenew measures were not realised because of the politicalinstability during the latter part of the year.The Public Enterprise Reform Commission (pERC)directed its activities towards identifying new publicentelprises for restructuring, while completing the reformactivities initiated before 2003. The completion of theprivatisation of sri Lanka Insurance corporation (SLIC) andthe sale of 100 petrol stations and one third of the common userfacility of the cPC, together with the leasing of the oil tankfarm in Trincomalee were two major programmes completedin 2003. with the privatisation of sLIC, the government movedout almost entilely fiom the insurance business leaving it in thehands of the private sector to be developed on marketprinciples. The process to select a third player fbr the petroleumindustry continued. with the completion of this programme, thegovernment owned cPC will compete with two private playersin the retail petroleum market. Initial measures were taken tounbundle the main activities of the CEB, i.e. generation,tlansmission and distribution, under the Electricity Refbrm Act.In addition, PERC has identified several public enterprises tobe divested in the future. The two major restructuringprogrammes launched outside PERC were the reform of the sriLanka Railways, converting its functions fi'om a departmentalenterprise to an Authority and the restructuring of the cwE toimprove its commercial viability. A comprehensiverestructuring programme was introduced in 2003 to improvethe service delivery of the cwE and to solve its outstandingdebt burden, to avoid burdening the government budget withthe need to subsidise the cwE. The government took over apart of the CWE's liabilities to the banking system by issuingTreasury bonds amounting to Rs.4.4 billion. In turn, rear estateowned by CWE was transfemed to the gover-nment, which willbe divested to settle the liabilities transferred to thegovernment. In addition, a 40 per cent stake of the retailnetwork and the management was sold to the private sector, toinfuse private sector skills through private-public sectorparticipation. PERC and the Department of public Enterprisesjointly worked together to refbrm several selected enterprisesin 2003. Under this programme, a separate programme wasintroduced to merge 4 enterprises, to restructure and reform 5lcolporations and enterprises. Finally, l5 public enterpriseswere earmarked fbr liquidation after.thorough review, whichdemonstrated that these institutions did not contribute much tothe general public.

The government continued its debt management strategyto make the government debt programme more market orientcdand to develop a medium to Iong-term debt malket, In addition,several measures were introduced to improve the primaryDealer (PD) svstem. In 2003, the borrowing requirement fiom

domestic sources was met almost entirely through medium-term market oriented Treasury bonds. As in 2002, governmentcontinued the policy of replacing high cost debt and retiringnon-marketable debt. Funds required fbr this purpose wereraised through rreasury bonds. The most notable developmentin 2003 was the extension of the maturity structure of rreasurybonds. The sharp decline in the resource requirement from thedomestic market, improved liquidity and the significantreduction in interest rates created an envilonment conducive forthe government to increase the maturity structure of Treasurybonds gradually from 6 year to 20 years. This helped toestablish a benchmark yield curve upto 20 years, a long f'eltneed to develop the long-term secondary market in domesticdebt. The completion of the preparatory work fbr the ScriplessSecurities settlement System (ssss) for government securitieswas another major development that would improve secondarymarket activity in govelnment debt. The SSSS commencedoperations in eally 2004.The policy of developing the PD system was continued in2003. Accoldingly, the number of pDs operating in thegovernment securities market was incr.eased fr.om l0 to I l. inaddition, the government has decided to set up a Special RiskReserve Fund by transt'erring a par.t of the after tax profits ofPDs. This Fund would promote the safety, soundness and thestability of the PD system and build up rhe pD capital base. Theminimum capital requirement of PDs was raised to Rs.400million fiom Rs.200 million. That minrmum is expected to beraise to Rs.450 million befbre mid-2005, in order to improvethe resilience of the PD system. The minimum subscriptionlevel of PDs at Treasury bill/bond auctions was reduced to l0per cent from l5 per cent. The firm two way quote (bid andoff'er plices) requirement tbr selected benchmark maturitieswas expanded to promote the liquidity of the medium and long-term market. Methods of valuation of securities and accountingmethods were revised to leflect real purchasing prices and thecommercial effbct of the transactions (Repo/Rever-se Repo),respectively.The operations of Plovincial Councils (PCs), under theexisting power sharing system with the central governmentestablished under the l3th Amendment to the Constitution in1981, continued in 2003, As the revenue generating powersdevolved to meet their expenditure commitments of the pC

system was not sufficient, PCs had to depend on the centralgovernment under the ongoing gap filling appr.oach to flnancethe deficit. The weaknesses in the central government fundingaffangements through the grant structure would depend on therevenue performance of the central government's and pCs.

Slippage in revenue collection at the centre curtailed the rupeefunded investment activities planned by PCs in their annualrnvestment"programmes. Further, the lack of a properinstitutional set-up with sufficient legal backing at the centreto regulate and monitor the operations of PCs was one of themain causes for the weak relationship with the centralgovernment. The Finance Commission, which was established

Part IChapter B - FISCAL POLICYAND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

The current system of organising/compiling data ongovernment operations used in Sri Lanka and in most of the

other countries is based on the 1986 Government FinanceStatistics Manual (GFSM 1986) introduced by theInternational Monetary Fund. Since then, many chan-{eshlve taken place in -sovernment financial operations, tiscalanalysis and macroeconomic statistics. In addition,increasing emphasis has been placed on replacing the

presenl cash based accounting drita with accrual data on alltransactions and slrmmary datii on a cash basis, as cash

transactions alone do not capture the timing of fiscal actions

and their impact on the economy. Since the current system

does not require governments to prepare a balance sheet, a

new system has made it a put and parcel of the govemment

accounting systems. Considering these developments, theIMF has introduced to its niember countries a new

Government Finance Statistics Manual 200I (GFSM 2001),The highlights oi- the new system are briefly discussed

below.

Objectives of the Nerv System

The provision of a comprehensive conceptual and

accounting framework suitable tbr analysing and evaluatin-qfiscal policy, especially the performance of the genelalgovernment sector, is the main purpose of the new GFS

system. Accordingly, this li'amework includes a new set ofinterrelated statements that integrate flows and stocksrelating to government opelations. The harmonisation ofgovernment finance with other macroeconomic analytic

systems, namely, Balance of Payments, National Accountsand Money and Banking, to facilitate consistency ofstatisticll analysis is another objective of the GFSM 2001.

The new system will address the treatment of iterns related

to transactions under accrual accounting, which at'e not cash

transactions (such as consumption of fixed capital). It willremedy classification shortcomings in the GFSM 1986

methodology (e.g.government sale of non flnanciztl public

enterprise), other economic tlows (e.g. valuation chan*9es ofbuildings and non financial public enterprise) and otherissues not covered in the GFSM 1986 methodology (e,g.

incurrence of explicit contingent liabilities). It is expectedthat the new system will also be useful in macroeconomiciinalysis, as it has more g0vernment finance summarybalances than in the previous system. The inclusion of a

balance sheet and other economic flows will also provide

a more comprehensive and integrated system [o asse sspolicy and measure the sustainability of the fiscal positionof sovernment activities.

Box 14

Main Featurcs

GFSM 2001 covers the activities of general govelnment(u,hich includes central government, state/provincialgovernments and local governments) as defined in the

System of National Accounts (SNA 1993) introduced for anadoption of a uniform national accounting system by

wor-ld's nltions. The compilation and reporting system callsfor a set of inteu'elated statements on stocks (assets andIiabilities) and flows (tran.sactions and other economicflows) of government operations. The double entry

accounting system is used to record the stocks and tlows.Flows are recorded on an accrual basis rvhen an economic

value is created, exchanged, transformed or extinguished.Transactions and stocks are to be valued at market prices.

Stocks are dellned u a unit's holding of assets and Iiabilitiesat a specific timer. A unit's net worth is derived by

deducting total liabilities fiom total assets.

Analytical Framework2

The tramework has three main flnancial statements:(l) Statement of govelnment operations(2) Statement of other economic flows(3) The balance sheet,In addition, a 'Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash'

is also included to provide intormation on liquidify,l. Statement of Government OperationsTransactions of general government related to revenue,

expense3 , non-flnancial rusets, financial assets and liabilities

are included in this statement. This statement summat'ises thetlansactions of the general go\/ernment in an accollntingperiod, irrespective of rvhether the cash t'lor.r, had taken place

or not. The eff'ect of fiscal policy on the net worth of generalgoyernment seclor, as well as its holdings of assets andliabilities, are reflected in this statement. The transactions areclassified according to whether they increase net ivorth

(r'evenue), decrease net worth (expenses), change the stockof non-financial assets (capital assets) and/or change thestock of a financial asset ol a liabiliry (tinancing).

1 In the present system, liabilities are only recorded in termsof the outstanding debt of the government, while changesthat occur to the government's financial position other thanthe transactions are not captured-2 Details o{ the framework are given in Chart 1 while balancesthat can be generated in the framework are summarised inTable 1,3 Expenditure in the 1986 system has been re named as'expense' in the 2001 system. The main feature of thisdefinition change is thatthe latter does not include'transac-tions on non financial assets' (i.e. the acquisition of fixedassets and changes in inventories etc.).

Migration Path to the New System

The implementation of the fully integrated GFS system willtake a Iong time and requires a significant amount of

resources, major changes in fiscal data classitlcation and

urider-lying accounting systems to be compatible with theacclual based system proposed in the new system. Thelength of time required and progress in adapting the new

system depend on the ne eds and circumstances specific toindividualcountries. Ilowever, the IMF has introduced the

concept of a 'migration path' to provide guidelines to theimplementation stages. The ma.;or steps include theplannin-e, approval, and the implementation of various

aspects of GFSM 2001, such as classification, compilationof balance sheets, and various stages of implementing

accrual accounting. Depending on the speed of ptogress andthe situations in each indivrduat country, one or several

steps can take place at one and the same tinre.

Sri Lanka's Migration Path

Like many other counh'ies, Sri Lanka is in the plocess of

migrating to lhe riew compiling and reporting system, which

Box 14 (contd.)

rvill take at least 5 years, commencing from 2003: The

proce ss will include the reclassification of fiscal data;changing the accounting system (to move torvatds anaccrual accounting system), changing legal plactices,

identif ication of assets to be included in the balance sheet,

valuation and compilation of assets and tlaining of staff. SriLanka has already classified the existing cash basis fiscal

data for 2002 according to the new classification. Thisinformation will be published in the IMF's Government

Finance Statistics Yearbook.

under the l3th Amendment to perform these functions, was notprovided with adequate legal power. As the country plans ahigh degree of fiscal devolution in the future, the establishmentof a strong monitoring system is essential.

8.2 Budget Outturn

The fiscal consolidation process progr.essed further in 2003, asenvisaged under the FMRA. The overall budget deficit decrinedto 8.0 per cent of GDP from 8.9 per cent in 2002 and 10.8 percent in 2001. Despite slippages in revenue, significantreductions in expenditure enabled the government to lower theovelall deficit. This improvement was entirely a result of thecontainment of recurrent expenditure including interestpayments. However, the realised deficit was still 0.5 per centof GDP higher than the original target of 7,5 per cent of GDpin Budget 2003.Inability to arrest the decline in the tax/GDpratio was responsible fbr this deviation, indicating the ur-gentneed to reverse the declining trend to achieve the fiscalconsolidation targets wrthin the stipulated time frameenvisaged under the FMRA.Following improved fiscal operations, the primary deficit,which reflects the impact of the cunent year's fiscal operationson the macroeconomy, and the cument account deficit, whichmeasures the level of government dis-savings, both improvedconsiderably in 2003. Consequent to measures introduced tocontain non-interest recurrent expenditure and non-prioritycapital expenditure, the primary deficit declined to 0.9 per centof GDP, the second consecutive year of decline. Following thesame trend, the cun'ent account detlcit decreased for the secondyear, to 3.3 per cent of GDP. This improvement in governmentdis-savings was the outcome of a reduction in both interest costand non-interest recurrent expenses. The primaLy deficrtdecreased more than the cunent account deficit due to a fasterdecline in non-interest recurrent expenditure. However, theimprovement in these fiscal aggregates was below target dueto a significant shortfall in tax revenue.The public sector deficit, which is the combined defrcit ofthe genelal government and public non-financial corporations,declined to I .9 per cent of GDP. An improved perfbrmance onthe part of public non-flnancial corporations (a deficit reductionof 0.1 per cent of GDP) also contributed to the overallimprovement. CPC, CEB and CWE reduced their-liabilities ro

the banking system in 2003. CPC was able to lower itsliabilities to the banking system |n2002 with the adoption ofan automatic pricing formula and improved financialmanagement. The continuation of thts strategy and the partreceipt of privatisation proceeds helped CPC to reduce itsliabilties further in 2003. CPC has reduced its liabilities to thebanking system by Rs.3.8 billion in the last two years. In 2003,CWE commenced its restructuring programme to improve itscommercial viability. Under the programme, a part of its salesnetwolk was privatised and the government settled a part of itsliabilities to the banking system by issuing Treasury bonds(Rs.4.4 billion), In 2003, the total reducrion of CWE liabilitiesto the banking system amounted to Rs.5,l billion. CEB wasable to reduce its liabilities to the banking system by about Rs.lbillion in 2003, retlecting the favourable weather conditionsthat prevailed during the year. However, liabilities of otherpublic non-financial corporatrons to the banking systemincreased by about Rs.0.4 billion in 2003. There is a clear needto accelerate the refbrm programme in key public enterprisesto improve their opelational efficiency and commercialviability.Following the trend since the early 1990's, total revenue

as a percentage of GDP continued to decline and reached 15.7per cent in 2003. The revenue target fbr 2003 was 17.1 per centof GDP, indicating a revenue slippage equivalent to L4 per centof GDP (Rs.27 billion). The decline in the levenue/GDP rariohas been due entirely to the reduction of the tax/GDP ratio to13.2 per cent in 2003. The total slippage in tax revenue wasequivalent to about Rs.33 billion (1,9 per cent of GDP).Although Budget 2003 had envisaged a series of revenueaugmenting measures to reverse the declining trend in the tax/GDP ratio, the government was not able to achieve theexpected target. The shortfall in tax collection was largely rnthe VAT and income tax, Other taxes were on target. The vastarlay of exemptions, tax leakages through the refund system,low efficiency in tax administration and weaknesses tndesigning the VAT structure could be cited as the main causesfol the slippage in VAT collections in 2003. The reduction oftax rates, investment adiustment, the tax amnestv and

system. Meanwhile, upward revisions in excise tax lates andthe imposition of duty on a large number of duty exemptedimports helped to raise revenue from these taxes. Non-taxrevenue exceeded the annual target in 2003 due to higherreceipts from the Strikes, Riots and Civil Commotion Fund.

168Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part IChapter IFISCAL POLICY AND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

Profit transfers fiom the central Bank remained the main non-tax revenue source.Policies adopted in2002 to contain non-interest recun-entexpenditure were continued and helped lower such expenses asa ratio of GDP in 2003. However, expenditure overruns insome departmental enter.prises, e.g., Railway and postaldepartments, and flood related expenses nullified some of thebenefits. Accordingly, non-interest recurrent expendituredropped by 1.6 per cenr of GDp to ll.9 per cent of GDp in2003. This improvement was further strengthened by theleduction in interest expenditure. Interest rates in the domesticmarket f'ell further than expected. Government r.eplaced highcost debt with low cost debt. Both these developments helpedlower the interest cost in 2003. Total recurrent expendituredeclined by 1.9 per cent of GDp to 19.0 per cent of GDp in2003. During the last two years, the reduction in non-interestrecun'ent expenditure, as a ratio of GDp, has been about 3 percent' This improvement shows the possibility of furthercontainment of non-interest recurent expenditure in areas suchas defence, transfer payments to departmental enterprises, civilservlce expenses and welfare programmes. In addition, prudentdebt management with the development of the debt marketwould help to continue the downward trend in the interest cost/GDP ratio, which commenced in 2003. Further improvementsIn lecurrent expenditure are essential to achieve the medium-term tiscal consolidation targets envisaged under the FMRA.The government's investment policy adopted in 2002 wascontinued in 2003. In view of the availability of donor fundsand the limited availability of domestic resources, the publicrnvestment programme in 2003 was designed to absorb themaxrmum available project related concessional donor funds,while limiting locally funded projects to priority sectors withhigh returns. As a result, total public investment expenditurein Budget 2003 was kept at 5.3 per cent of GDp as in Budget2002' The 'ealised public investment programme shows thatthe government was unable to complete the annual investmentplans tbr 2003. Although foreign resource utilisation rateimproved significantly to over 20 per cent in 2003 fLom t4 percent in 2002, resource constraints on the domestic frontcompelled the authorities to curtail the release of funds forlocally funded projects. The slippages in revenue coilection andthe commitment to minimise the deviation from the overalldeficit under the medium-term fiscal strategy were the mainfactors, which restricted the issue of funds for publicinvestment. consequently, public investment in 2003 amountedto 5 per cent of GDP, 0.3 percentage points lower than theoriginal target. However, the realised programme was amalginal improvement over the public investment of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2002.The current level of public investment is far below whatis required to accelerate growth to over 6-8 per cent in themedium term or to encourage private investment. However,the government faces difficulties in increasing publicinvestment through local funding, as high domestic bonowing

would destabilise macroeconomic fundamentals. Therefore,every effort needs to be made to raise the maximum possibleamount of concessional donor funding for public investment.The balance funding requirement must be met from revenuesources, to avoid the negative impact of high governmentdomestic borrowing on the overall economy. This reiteratesthe need to strengthen the revenue performance of thegovernment.In financing the budget deficit, government's r.eliance onthe domestic malket was significantly reduced to 4.5 per centof GDP in 2003. Externalresources available for the financingof budgetary operations increased sharply in 2003. Totalexternal funds for budgetary financing (loans and grants)reached a historical high of US dollars I billion (gross receipts)compared to US dollars 630 million in2002. The privatisationprogramme performed lelatively better in 2003. With theseimprovements, the government's borrowing requir-ement fi-omdomestic sources dropped to the lowest level since 1997.The sharp increase in fbreign aid utilisation in 2003 wasone of the major developments that contributed to improvedperfolmance in the fiscal sector as well as other sectors in theeconomy. Gross resources available fl-om external sources fbrfinancing budgetary operations amounted to Rs,96 billion,including Rs.88 billion of loans and Rs.8 billion of grants. Totaldisbursements included fbreign programme loans of uS dollars244 milhon (Rs.23.5 billion) received from multilateral andbilateral donors and US dollaL 100 million (Rs.9.5 billion) ti-omNEXI of Japan. On a net basis, external resources available fbrfinancing the budget amounted to Rs.5l billion (Rs,43 billionloans and Rs.8 billion grants). As most of these funds areconcessional, the burden of servicing these debts would be low.Priority needs to be given to maintaining this higher utilisationof concessional external funding for budgetary opelations, asit will serve multiple objectives such as increasing publicinvestment, lowering the borrowing pressur.e in the domesticmarket and increasing the country's reserves,The privatisation pl'ogramme in 2003 was close to thetarget. Proceeds fiom privatisation brought in Rs,l0.2 billioncompared to Rs,l3,5 billion envisaged in Budget 2003, Theprivatisation of SLIC realised Rs.6 billion. A parr paymenr ofRs. 2.7 billion received for budgetery operations from the saleof one hundred petrol stations and one third of the common userfacility of CPC in 2003. The sale of 40 per cenr of rhe rerailoutlets of CWE, and the sale of the government's balance shareholding in plantation companies, hotels, banks and otherprivatised enterprises generated the balance of Rs.l.5 billion.Higher receipts from external sources and the privatisationprogramme, as well as the reduction in the total resource gaphelped to lower borrowing in the domestic market in 2003.Accordingly, resources mobilised tr-om domestic sourcesdeclined to 4.5 per cent of GDP (Rs.80 billion) in comparisonto 8 per cent of GDP (Rs,126 billion) in 2002.In 2003, the govemment was able to reduce its liabilitiesto the banking system for the second consecutive year. Total

Part IChapter I - FISCAL POLICY AND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

government liabilities to the banking system declined by Rs.2lbillion, in comparison to Rs.5 billion in2002. This was a net

outcome of a reduction in government liabilities to the CentralBank by Rs.29 billion and an increase of liabilities to

commercial banks by Rs.8 billion.With these developments, the government was also able

to retire high cost debt (such as outstanding import bills with

state banks) by raising funds from the domestic market at alower rate. Further, the first three tranches of the US dollardenominated Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs),

amounting to US dollars 158.5 million (Rs.15.2 billion), which

matured in November and December 2003, were letired. In

addition, the governmenl was able to retire early a significant

amount of callable non-market oriented debt, i.e., Rupee loans

(Rs.33 billion), by raising funds in the domestic market through

marketable instruments at a lower cost. A continuation of thefiscal consolidation efforts as envisaged in the FMRA wouldstrengthen the government's ability to manage its debt

operations and improve overall fiscal management.

8.3 Revenue

The revenue/GDP ratio continued to decline turther in 2003,

entirely due to the continuous reduction in the tax/GDP ratto.

Sri Lanka's tax effort (13.2 per cent of GDP) is significantlybelow the average for developing countries (18 per cent).During 2003 several factors contributed to the weak

performance in the tax collection. A number of tax incentivesgiven in the Budget and the postponement and delays inimplementing a number of tax measures proposed to expand

the tax base significantly eroded the tax base, Further, the tax

amnesty had a negative impact on the potential collection of taxrevenue in 2003. In addition, weaknesses in the tax

administration, especially in the refund mechanism of VAT and

income taxes, also contributed to the poor performance. Non-tax revenue collection was 2.5 per- cent of GDP, as in 2002.Non-tax revenue came mainly from Central Bank profit

transfers and profits and dividends from public enterprises.

Tax Revenue

Tax revenue amounted to Rs.231.6 billion in 2003, a slowgrowth of 4 per cent in comparison to an 8 per cent growth in

2002. The share of tax revenue to total revenue declined

marginally from 85 per cent in2002 to 84 per cent in 2003. The

composition of tax revenue was the same as in2002; taxes on

consumption accounting for 83 per cent of tax revenue and

income taxes accounting for the balance. The share of taxes on

domestic goods and services (37 per cent), taxes on imports (46per cent) and income taxes (17 per cent) in tax revenue

remained at previous year's levels, indicating a proportionatereduction in the tax revenue/GDP ratio in all three sectors in

2003.

Revenue from income taxes declined from 2.4 per cent ofGDP in 2002 to 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2003. However, in

absolute terms, revenue collected increased by 5 per cent to

Rs.39.4 billion in 2003 fiom Rs.37.4 billion in2002.Revenuecollection f}om corporate income taxes and personal incometax decreased as a percentage of GDp. However, higherrevenue collection from the withholding tax helped offset partof the shoLtfall in corporate and personal income taxes.The corporate income tax/GDp ratio in 2003 was 0.9 percent as in2002. Although the Advanced Company Tax (ACT)was abolished fiom 2002, companies could set off any previousACT paid against their cunent year's tax liability. Similarly,even though the investment allowance was abolished,unclaimed balances that could be set off when calculatingtaxable income are still available to companies that have madelarge capital investments in the past, reducing the corporate taxcollection flom these institutions. Tax collection from largetaxpayers increased during 2003,while corporate tax collectionfrom small and medium taxpayers decreased significantly. Thecorporate tax collection from the banking, insurance andtelecommunication sectors also decreased during 2003. Thismay be due to higher provisioning in the banking sector andthat investment in the telecommunication sector were eligiblefor investment allowances. Meanwhile, the corporate incometax rate for companies with taxable income of over Rs.5 millionper annum was reduced to 30 per cent from 35 per cent, but 50per cent of this tax cut, r.e.,2.5percent, was to be piaced in aHuman Resources Endowment Fund (HREF). public quotedcompanies, with 300 or more members and taxable incomeover Rs,5 million per annum, was to be taxed at 30 per cent ofwhich 2.5 per cent would be credited to the HREF. However,as this Fund has not yet been established the colrection for theHREF was transferred to the consolidated fund for budgetarypurposes. The tax concessions and exemptions granted inBudget 2002 and Budget 2003 have also reduced the tax base,resulting in lower tax collection. The tax amnesty also mayhave contributed to lower collections from corporate taxes.Personal income tax too declined significantly in 2003.The increase of the threshold from Rs.144,000 to Rs.240.000

and the upward revision of tax slabs in 2002 were the maincauses. Further, the highest tax rate of 35 per cent was reducedto 30 per cent. The income tax exemption of public sectoremployees was limited to employment income, and theiremployment income was taken into account in determining thestatutory income threshold for tax purpose of other income witheffect from I April 2003.

Revenue collection ftom withholding tax increas edby 23per cent in 2003 to Rs.14.2 billion. The increase came mainlyfrom witholding tax on interest earnings from governmentsecurities, which accounted tor 77 per cent of the totalcollection. The increase of marketable securities with longermaturities could be cited as the main reason for this.Meanwhile, the tax free limit on interest income under the l0per cent withholding tax was raised tiom Rs.72,000 per annumto Rs.108,000 per annum tiom I January 2003.Revenue from consumption taxes declined to 10.9 per centof GDP in 2003 from ll.6 per cent of GDP in 2002. Thedecline was in both taxes on domestic goods and services andon imports. The combined collection from GST, VAT and NSLof 6 per cent of GDP in 2002 fell to 5.5 per cent in 2003 undera unified VAT collection. The decline in the VAT collectionis partly attributed to the postponement of several measures tobroaden the VAT base, the operation of multiple VAT rates,administrative weaknesses in the collection mechanism and inthe refund mechanism. It was planned to extend the coverageof VAT to persons providing tlnancial services and to restrictthe input tax credit entitlement on assets acquired to be madeavailable on lease agreements to l0 per cent to broaden theVAT base and improve the net collection of taxes. However,implementation of these measures were delayed due to delaysin legislature. The practice of making refunds within one monthof the claims being submitted resulted in refunds being madewithout comprehensive audits being conducted, resulting inpossible overpayment, The proportion of refunds to total taxcollection increased significantly from 12per cent under GST

to 20 pel cent under VAT. The VAT collection from some of

the major taxable sectors could become negative as they couldclaim input credit for their large investments at a higher rate of20 per cent, while paying a VAT rate of l0 per cent on their

sales. Despite the glowth in imports, revenue collection fromVAT on imports declined marginally to 2.6 per cent of GDP,fi'om a combined collection of VAT/GST and NSL of 3 per centof GDP in2002. The main reasons for that fall was that someitems, whrch were liable for NSL earlier, were exempted fiomVAT and the effective rate under GSTiNSL was higher thanunder VAT, In the manufacturing sector, the main source ofVAT revenue in 2003 was construction followed by petroleum,

cigarettes and liquor. In the non manufacturing sector, the mainVAT revenue collection came from the telecommunications

and finance and insurance sectors.Revenue collection from excise duty declined by 2 percent in 2003 to Rs.51 billion due to lower collections from

cigarettes and petroleum products, Excise duty collection from

cigarettes declined marginally to Rs.20 billion. Although therates were revised upward on some brands of cigalettes, adecline in domestic sales of popular products contributed to thelower collection of excise duty from cigarettes. A large influx

of cigarettes smuggled into the country and the local supply ofillegal white cigarettes are said to have resulted in reduceddomestic sales.Growth in both hard and soft liquor production, and anupward revision of excise taxes in 2003 contributed to thehigher excise duty collection from liquor. Hard liquorproduction increased by l3 per cent and soft liquor production

increased by 12 per cent. Further, the excise duty rates wele

levised upwalds on molasses, palmyrah arrack, coconut ar-rack

and processed arrack from Rs.299 per proof litle to Rs.330 perproof litre and on country made foreign spirits from Rs.399per proof litre to Rs.440 per proof litre, with effect from

September 2003. Towards the end of the year, the excise dutyon malt liquor below 5 per cent strength was increased to

Rs.20 per litre and for malt liquor above 5 per cent strength toRs.35 per litre from Rs,l5 per litre and Rs.25 per litre,

respectively.The excise duty collection from petroleum productsdeclined from 1.1 per cent of GDP in2002 to 0.8 per cent in

2003. The main reason for the decline was the comparativelyhigh excise rate structure in operation in 2002 and payment of

arrears of Rs.2 billion by the CPC in 2002. The excise duty onpetrol was reduced from Rs.24 per litre to Rs.2l per litre fromAugust 2002 and subsequently increased to Rs.22 per litre inAugust 2003, with the imposition of the Road Tax. In a similar

manner, the excise duty on diesel was brought down from Rs.4

per litre to Rs.3 per litre and then increased to Rs.3.50 per litre

from August 2003. Thus, lower excise rates were applicable for

diesel and petrol during most of the year.

The excise duty collection from motor vehicles increased

by 51 per cent to Rs.6.9 billion in 2003. There was a significantincrease in imports of high valued motor vehicles, which

contributed to this higher excise collection.

Revenue trom import duties (including the 20 per centsurcharge) increased sharply by 2l per cent from Rs.28.3billion in2002 to Rs.34.2 billion in 2003, The import duty/GDPratio increased marginally from 1.8 per cent in 2002to 1.9 per

cent in 2003. This increase was the combined outcome of the

imposition of duty on most exempted imports, upward revisionof rates and growth in imports duling 2003, The main sources

of import duty were motor vehicles, sugar, edible oils, potatoes,

big onions and milk products. The 2 per cent tarif f band, which

was introduced from end 2002, was increased to 2.5 per centwith effect from September 2003. In addition, specitic dutres

on several essential items were revised upward to protect localproducers. The average duty rate (the ratio of import dutycollection, excluding the import duty surcharge, to total valueof imports) rose to 4.6 per cent in 2003 fiom 4.1 per cent in2002 as the number of zero rated items were reduced from

November 2002. However, the effbctive duty rate (the ratio of

total import duty collection, excluding the import surcharge, to

dutiable imports) decreased to 12.4 per cent in 2003 from 14.7

per cent in2002. This was mainly due to the introduction of alower tariff rate (2 per cent) on a large number of items, which

had been exempted before,The revenue collection from the Ports and AirportsDevelopment Levy (PAL) increased sharply by 57 per centfrom Rs,3.5 billion to Rs.5.5 billion in 2003 largely due to thefull year impact. The PAL was introduced from I May 2002.From I January 2003, the PAL applicable for imports solely

used for exports was reduced from 0.75 per cent to 0.5 per cent.

The coverage of the debits tax was extended to savings depositswith commercial banks and licensed specialised banks. with

eff'ect tiom I January 2003. The exemption from debits tax onwithdrawals was increased from Rs.10,000 per month to

Rs.20,000 per month fiom I January 2003. Although these two

taxes were introduced to recoup the revenue loss from theabolition of stamp duty, the combined revenue collection fbrPAL and the debits tax in 2003 as a percentage of GDP wasonly 0.5 per cent in comparison to an average stamp dutycollection of 0.7 per cent of GDP dunng 1997 -2001.

Non Tax Revenue

Non tax revenue increased by l4 per cent to Rs.44.9 billion,from Rs.40.1 billion in 2002, and exceeded the target ofRs.39.2 billion, As a percentage of GDP, non tax revenue

collection was 2.5 per cent, the same proportion as in 2003. Thehigher revenue collection came mainly from Central Bankprofits transfers (Rs.l0 billion), revenue collection from sales

and charges (Rs.9 billion) and profits and dividends tiompublic enterprises (Rs.5.4 billion). A higher profits transfer ofRs.l.7 billion and dividends fiom the Sri Lanka InsuranceCorporation amounting to Rs,750 million, which were not

budgeted, contributed to the increased revenue from protits and

lending to public enterprises by government, and rentcollection, were below budget targets.8.4 ExpenditureIn 2003, the government continued its expenditurerationalisation measures with a view to strengthening the fiscalconsolidation process. Accordingly, Budget 2003 envisagedmaintaining total expenditule at24.6 per cent of GDp, withcurrent expenditure at lg.3 per cent of GDp and capitalexpenditure at 5.3 per cent of GDp. The realised totalexpenditure, decreased to 23.7 per cent of GDp in 2003compared to 25.4 per cent in2002. This decrease came mainlyf}om a decline in recurrent expenditure, which amounted to l9per cent of GDP in 2003, as against 20.9 per cent in 2002. Asin previous years, the realised capital expenditure and netlending was below the annual target due to the curtailment ofnon priority rupee funded public investment and a shortfall inproject related fbreign resources. However, in comparison to2002, expenditure on capital and net rending increasedmarginally to 4.7 per cent of GDp in 2003 from 4.6 per cent in2002.

Current expenditure

In nominal terms, cun'ent expenditure increased marginally toRs.334.7 billion in 2003. However, lower interest faymentsand the containment of non-interest recurrent expenditurehelped reduce recurrent expenditure as a percentage of GDp,The reduction in interest payments was mainly due to a declinein market rates and reduced borrowing requirements. Thedecline in non-interest current expenditure was the outcome ofseveral factors. Expenditure on personal emoluments andpensron payments was contained by avoiding ad hoc salary andpension revisions in2002 and 2003, The continuation of theceasefire agreement contributed to containing defence relatedexpenditure. In addition, welfale payments and transfers topublic institutions were contained close to the budgeted level.However, there were expenditure overruns in departmentalenterprises and new expenditure on flood relief that offset partof the benefits achieved through other measures.In 2003, expenditure on salaries and wages, in nominalterms, increased marginally by 3 per cent, slightly higher thanthe budgeted level of Rs.9l billion. rn2002, the increase was17 per cent due to the full year impact of the salary increaseimplemented towards end 2001. salaries and wages declinedto 5.2 per cent of GDP fiom 5.6 per cent in 2002. This waspossible as a result of the continuation of the suspension ofrecruitment to the public sector, and the avoidance of ad hocsalary increases during 2003. salaries and wages remainedunchanged at27 per cent of recurrent expenditure.The signing of the peace agreement jn 2002 and thecontinuation of the peaceful environment throughout 2003enabled the government to contain def'ence related expenditure.Accordingly, defence expenditure (excruding expenditure onpublic order and saf'ety) declined in 2003. In nominal terms,

Part IChapter I - FISCAL POLICYAND BUDGETAFIY OPERATIONS

defence expenditure declined by 4 per cent to Rs.47 billion and

was close to the budgeted target. Defence expenditure in 2003,

as apercentage of GDP, also declinedto2.l percent, from 3.1

per cent in 2002. Although new recruitments to the defence

services increased expenditure on salaries and wages, a

reduction in the import of military equipment and hardware

helped reduce total expenditure. Further, expenditure incuned

to maintain public order and safety decreased by 2.5 per cent

to Rs.l4.6 billion (0.8 per cent of GDP) from Rs.l5 billion (0.9

per cent of GDP) in2002. Total expenditure on defence and

maintenance of law and order declined to 3.5 per cent of GDP

trom 4.0 per cent in2002.Despite the increase in the debt stock, the continuing

decline in domestic market interest rates and the replacementof high cost government borrowing with marketable debt

instruments helped reverse the increasing trend in interest

payments. Interest payments, which amounted to Rs.l25.lbillion in 2003, continued to be the single largest component

of recurrent expendituLe (37 per cent), an increase of 7 per cent

over 2002, This was, however, much lower than the 24 per

cent increase in 2002. Interest payments declined to 7.1 per

cent of GDP from 7.4 per cent in 2002. Of the total, interest

payments on domestic debt amounted to Rs.l13.5 billion,

while payments on foleign debt were Rs.I L6 billion. Interest

payments on Treasury bonds became the major component of

interest (Rs.50,9 billion) with almost twofold increase over

2002. This was cleally the result of moving to marketable debtsecurities. In contrast, interest payments on Rupee loans

declined to Rs.35.6 billion as they were gradually phased out'Interest payments on Treasury bills decreased to Rs'24.1

billion from Rs.25,7 billion in2002 because of lower inteles[

rates. The balance amount of interest payments was in respectof SLDBs and non-instrument borrowings from the banking

system.In 2003, actual interest payments were significantly lowerby (Rs.5.l billion) than the budgetary allocation' Higher

external bon'owing through concessional sources reduced theborrowing requirement from the domestic market' This

supported the declining trend in domestic interest rates, which,in turn, reduced interest costs. Close monitoling of thegovernment cash flow operations, and improved debt

management activities, also helped,

There was a reversal in the continuously increasing trend

observed in cutrent transf'ers and subsidies. These amounted to

Rs.70.9 billion, a decline of 5 per cent over 2002. As a

percentage of GDP too, it decreased, from 4.7 per cent |n2002

to 4 per cent.In 2003, expenditure on pension payments remained

almost unchanged at Rs.3l billion as in 2002. However, this

was Rs.2,4 billion less than the budgetary allocation' Thisunder expenditure was mainly due to delays in the

implementation of recommendations of several committees on

pension anomalies. HoweveL, late implementation of such

recommendations may increase the pension payments in the

The new contributory pension system is expected tolower the unfunded pension liability of the governm;nt in thelong term.Expenditure incurred on the Samurdhi programme wasRs.8'7 billion in 2003, lz per cent less rhan in 2002. This wasmainly due to the strong commitment of the government tocontinue the screening mechanism to select only the mostneedy, and the continuation of the empowerment programme.The enactment of the welfare Benefrt Act in 2002 provides anopportunity to implement entry and exit criteria for Samurdhibeneficiaries in the future,Expenditure on the fertiliser subsidy in 2003 amounted toRs.2.2 billion, compared to Rs. 2.4 billion in2002. However,this was a l0 per cent incrcase over original estimates. Despitethe reduction in the usage of urea in 2003 the paymeni ofarrears of Rs.1.l billion carried forward from2002 was themain reason for this increase. A quantity based fixedfertiliser subsidy scheme (Rs.300 per 50 kg bag or Rs.6,000

per metric ton), which was introduced in October 2002,continued in 2003,Among the other welfare transfers to households,expenditure on school uniforms declined by 25 per cent toRs,0.6 billion, mainly due to the programme introduced bythe govemment to improve the targeting of the distributionof school uniforms to needy people. Expenditure on theprovision of flood relief in May 2003 amounted to Rs.0,gbillion, for which there were no budgetary provisions in2003- Meanwhile, expenditure on school textbooks and busseason tickets for children was maintained at the budsetedlevel.

Expenditure on transfers to public institutions amountedto Rs.l1.9 billion, a marginal decrease over 2002. Theunivelsity Grants commission (Rs,4.6 billion), the SamurdhiAuthority of Sri Lanka (Rs.2.9 billion) and the MahaweliAuthority of Sri Lanka (Rs.0.8 billion) were rhe majorrecipients of these transt'ers.

Pad IChapter B - FISCAL POLICYAND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

Transfers to public cot'porations declined by 29 per centto Rs.5.7 billion in 2003. This was mainly due to the

containment of transfers to public corporations despite the

higher losses incurred by Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) (Rs.2.2billion), Regional Transport Companies (RTCs) (Rs.0.7billion), Department of Posts (Rs.0.8 billion) and CWE(Rs, 1.8 billion), Higher fuel prices, failure to adjust railwayfares to reflect operational costs, and managementinefficiencies were identified as reasons for the higher lossesof SLR. In 2003, the government transformed the SLR to aRailway Authority, to provide better services to railcommuters, and to minimise losses by testructuring therailway service, while making the industry viable. Theincreased losses of RTCs were due to management

inefficiencies, the relatively large number of employees and

the failure to adjust passenger fares on a cost recovery basis.Of these', the deferment of the implementation of the fare

rncrease agreed on by the National Transport Commission in2003 was the most important reason. The losses in the

Department of Posts were mainly due to inadequate revisionsin postal rates. These continuing losses in public corporations

reiterates the necessity for continuing restructuring plans with

regard to these public entities.

Public Investment

The public investment programme expanded in 2003. Total

expenditure on public investment increased to 5.0 per cent of

GDP (Rs.87.4 billion) from 4.6 per cent of GDP (Rs.72.2billion) in2002. However, the realised investment programme

was below the annual planned programme of 5.3 per cent of

GDP (Rs.95 billion) envisaged in Budget 2003. This reduction

was a result of the curtailment of non-priority rupee funded

capital expenditure and a shortfall of donor funded project

loans linked to the investment programme. The policy adopted

by successive governments to curtail planned public investmentto contain the ovelall deficit has the negative effect of

hampering the long-term growth prospects in the economy. The

allocation of funds for public investment in the recent past has

been below the required level, underscoring the urgency of

increasing resource allocation for public investment with high

return to accelerate the growth momentum, while tinancing this

investment as far as possible through concessional foreign

sources and govemment revenue.Expenditure incurred by the central government

(ministries and departments) fbr purchase of capital assets, and

construction and development of fixed assets increased to 2.1

per cent of GDP (Rs.36.6 billion) compared to 1.7 per cent(Rs.26.5 billion) in2002. These investments were mainly

concentrated on education, health, agriculture, irrigation andrural development programmes. Total central government

transfers for investment programmes in public non-financial

corporations and institutions rose to 1.9 per cent of GDP

(Rs.34.2 billion) from 1,7 per cent (Rs.26.6 billion) in 2002.Major investment programmes were reported in the Road

Development Authority (RDA) (Rs,13.2 billion), CeylonElectricity Board (CEB) (Rs.5.2 billion), National Water

Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) (Rs.7.8 bitlion) and

Mahaweli Development Authority (Rs.3.0 billion).Investment activities of PCs through rupee funded

programmes (Rs. 4.2 billion) reported a decline in 2003. Thts

was a result of reduced allocation of funds from the original

budget as well as further controls on releasing rupee funds from

the central govemment due to significant shortfalls in revenue.The central government continued its on-lending

programmes to channel govemment guaranteed foreign tunds

to commercially oriented public enterprises. In 2003, the on-

lending programme was limited to 0.7 per cent of GDP (Rs.

12.3 billion) compared to 0.9 per cent (Rs, I3. 6 billion) in

2002. As in the past, CEB (Rs.6.5 billion), SLPA (Rs.l,3billion), CPC (Rs.3.7 billion) and Sri Lanka Telecom (Rs.0.2

billion) continued to be the main recipients that benetited from

the programme. In comparison to the original budgetary target,

the resource utilisation ratio of the on-lending programme,

decreased to 92 per cent compared to 95 per cent in the

prevlous year.On a functional basis, public investment in economic

services amounted to 3.3 per cent of GDP (Rs.58.7 billion) and

accounted for 67 per cent of the total public investment

programme in 2003. In comparison to the total budgetary

provisions (Rs,60.6 billion), the realised programme reached 97

per cent. The shortfall was mainly due to the curtailment of

funds allocated for rupee funded projects and the shortfall in

the foreign funded programme.Under the public investment on economic services,

expenditure incurred in the transport and telecommunication

sectors increased to 1.1 per cent of GDP (Rs.20.2 billion) and

accounted fbr 34 per cent of investment in economic services

in 2003, RDA (Rs. 13.2 billion) and Sri Lanka Railways (Rs.l.7billion) were the major investors, accounting forl4 per cent ofthis sectoral investment in 2003. Public investment in the

energy and water supply sector reported an increase to 1.4 per

cent of GDP (Rs.23.8 billion) and accounted for 4l per cent of

total investment in economic services. CEB (Rs ll.7 billion)

and NWSDB (Rs.7.8 billion) accounted for 82 per cent of the

investment in this sector in 2003, Public investment in the

agriculture and ilrigation sectors (Rs.8.4 billion) and the

tisheries sector (Rs.0.7 billion) accounted for I6 per cent oftotal investment in economic services. As in the past, the

Mahaweli Authority (Rs. 3.0 billion) continued to be the mainrecipient. In addition, direct investment in the agriculture,irrigation and fisheries sectors by relevant ministries and

departments (Rs.5.5 billion) accounted for 65 per cent of the

investment in these sectors in 2003.Public investment in social services, at 1.1 per cent of

GDP (Rs, 19. 2 billion), showed a marginalincrease compared

with the I per cent in the plevious year. Thrs inctease was seenin two major sectors, i,e. the education and health sectors.

Investment in the education and health sectors was mainly for

construction of schools and hospitals and improvement of theirservices. Investment in the housing sector (Rs.3,2 billion) wasmarnly focussed on the development of housing facilities forpublic sector employees, plantation housing and urban housingprogrammes. of the total investment in community services(Rs 2.2 billion), 9 per cent was provided for the samurdhiAuthority (Rs.0.2 billion) to finance various communitvdevelopment and empowerment programmes.8.5 Provincial CouncilsThe ove'all budgetary operations of pcs showed anrmprovement in 2003. Revenue collection increased by 24 percent ln rupee terms to 0.7 per cent of GDp. This increasereflected the revival of economic activities in the country,Expenditure was maintained at2.g per cent of GDp as in theprevious year. Current expenditure was reduced by 0,2percentage points to 2.3 per cent of GDp, while expenditure onprovincial investment activities increased to 0.5 per cent ofGDP. with these improvements, the dependence of pcs oncentral government grants declined to 2.1 per cent of GDp from2'3 per cent in 2002. This improvement in budgetary operationsof PCs has cont'ibuted to the consolidation of fiscai operationsof the central government.The major issues with rega'd to the operations of the pcsystem remained in 2003. Some of the major issues were thelimited scope for resource ailocation, inadequate power tomobilise resources, high dependence on the central govemmentto flnance the resource gap and a weak rerationship with thecentral government due to the rack of a strong institutionarframework for regulation and monitoring. The strengthening ofthe Finance Commission to regulate and monitor the functions

of PCs could be recognised as one of the priority actions to beimplemented by enacting the Finance commission Act.However, the resolution of other requires more comprehensiverefbrms in the overall devolution system, which could only beimplemented through constitutional amendments.

Revenue

The totalrevenue collection of pCs rose by 24per cent in 2003in comparison to an 8 per cent increase in 2002. a 25 per centincrease in tax revenue being the major cause. Increasedrevenue from turnover taxes and stamp duties mainlycontributed to this increase and accounted for 7l per cent oftotal revenue. Turnover taxes grew by l4 per cent andcontinued to be the main revenue source of pcs. The collectionflom stamp duties grew by 63 per cent, reflecting the increasern property transactions wrth the revival of economic activity.other revenue sources such as licence fees and sales andcharges also showed moderate increases in 2003.As in the past, the Western provincial Cothe largest revenue collection, accounting(Rs.7,820 million) of total revenue collectionThe concentration of commercial and industrial activities andthe high population in the wpc helped ro mobilise higherrevenues there. The central province, the southern province

and the North western Province were the other major revenuecollectors. The collection of provincial taxes in the Northernand the Eastern provinces has been a function of the centralgovernment due to the war situation.

Current Expenditure

The policies adopted by the government to contain non-interestrecument expenditure helped to restrict the increase in recurrentexpenditure in PCs. Accordingly, although the currentexpenditure increased marginally in2003 in rupee ferms, as apercentage ned by 0.2 per.centage points ofGDP to 2.3 . The WpC accounted for 23 percent of the t nditure of the pCs. About 70 percent of the b ncurred by the Central, Southern,North East, and North West provincial councils.

Part IChapter B - FISCAL POLICYAND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

Based on the economic classification, expenditule on

personal emoluments in the provincial councils increased

marginally in rupee terms, but decreased by 0.2 percentage

points in GDP terms to 1,7 per cent in 2003, The continuationof the govemment policy of the suspension of recruitment to

the provincial service and avoidance ofad hoc salary increasesfor employees in PCs helped to contain the expenses on

personal emoluments within the targeted level, The education

(69 per cent) and health (22 per cent) sectors continued to be

the main absorbers of personal emoluments, accounting for 9lper cent of the total personal emoluments. The balance

emolument expenditure has been distlibuted among the other

sectors such as provincial administration, community service

and economic infrastructure. Other current expenditure was

used for other non-wage expenses on goods and services.Based on the functional classification, recurrentexpenditure incurred by the provincial administration,

economic services and social services amounted to Rs'3,264

million, Rs. 1,715 million, and Rs.34,821 million, respectively.Education and health sectors continued as two main sub-

sectors, representing social services and spending Rs.2I,94lmillion and Rs.8,125 million, respectively. In view of the

consolidated expenditure on education and health services by

the central government and provincial councils, PCs play a

major role in these two functions sharing 65 per cent and 45 per

cent of total consolidated expenses, respectively.

Capital Expenditure

Total expenditure incuned by PCs for investment activities in

2003 amounted to Rs.9,423 million (0,5 per cent of GDP)' This

was a 56 per cent increase over the 2002. The provincial

investment programme included foreign funded special

projects, Provincial Specific Development Projects (PSDP)'

acquisition of capital goods and capital transfers. Expenditure

incumed under foreign funded special projects increased. These

projects include the Notth East Emergency Reconstruction

Projects, North-East Community Restoration Project, North-

East Irrigated Agricultural Project and the Southern Provincial

Roads Improvement Project,Expenditure on PSDP declined by 5 per cent, mainly due

to resh'ictton in funds released by the central g6vernment underPSDG. PSDP projects primarily focused on regional

investment programmes relating to education, health and roads.

Central Government Transfers

Central government transfers to PCs include block grants,

criteria based grants, matching grants, provincial specific

development grants (PSDG) and foreign grants for special

projects. Block grants amounting to Rs.30,462 million were

provided to finance the recurrent expenditure of the PCs in

2003 compared to Rs.30,574 million in 2002. Meanwhile,

criteria based grants decreased by Rs'393 million to Rs'607

million. As indicated above, funds released under the PSDG

declined to Rs.3,332 million in 2003. With the inauguration of

rehabilitation and teconstruction activities in the North and the

East, funds transferred for foreign funded project recorded a

significant increase to Rs.3,184 million in 2003. As in the past,

shortfalls in revenue collections and resource constraints at the

central government have restricted the transf-er of funds foL

investment through the grant system.

8.6 Public Enterprise Reforms

As stated in the medium term policy strategy, thegovernment's goal is to move out from all commercial

activities that can be mote efficiently undertaken by the private

sector. Some commercial services provided by the govetnment

can be more etficiently provided through the private sector or

a public-private partnership. The privatisation programme in

2003 addressed these broader objectives. The government

expected to raise Rs.l3.5 billion from the privatisation

programme. The actual ptoceeds at end December 2003

amounted to Rs.l0.5 billion (if the final payment for the

divestiture of 100 petrol stations and one third of the common

user facility of the CPC by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)

received in Janualy 2004, is included, total privatisation

proceeds amounts to Rs.l4.9 billion).

The government took several further steps in its policy of

liberalising the petroleum sector, announced in Budget 2002.

An automatic pricing formula was introduced, the bunkering

service was privatised and the Petroleum Products (Special

Provisions) Act No. 33 of 2002 was enacted enabling the entry

of multiple private players to the sector. In 2003, the second

player to the petloleum sector, IOC, entered the market. One

hundred petrol stations and a one third stake in the common

user facility of the CPC was sold to IOC's local venture, Lanka

Indian Oil Corporation (LIOC) at a price of US dollars 75

million. The tinal agreement was signed in December 2003 and

part payment tor the transaction, amounting to US dollars 30million was received in December 2003 (inclusive of the US

dollars 2 million advance payment in February 2003). The

balance US dollars 45 million was received in Januaty 2004.

The China Bay petroleum tank farm was leased for 35 years fbr

US dollars 100,000 per annum to the LIOC as part of the long-

term plan to develop petroleum product storage facilities. The

third player in the petroleum sector is expected to enter the

market in 2004. The prospective investors have been short-

listed and they have submitted binding bids and technicalproposals for evaluation to the Technical Evaluation

Committee and the Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee.

The other major privatisation completed in 2003 was the

sale of the SLIC. Government started major reforms in the

government owned insurance enterprises in 2001' Accordingly,

National Insurance Corporation (NIC) was first sold in two

transactions in 2001 and2002. The process of privatisation of

SLIC began in 2001 and was tlnalised in April 2003' The SLIC'

a fully government owned company, was privatised with the

sale of 90 per cent of the shares to a private sector consortium.

The balance l0 per cent of the shares were distributed among

Part IChapter 8 - FISCAL POLICYAND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

8.7 Financing the Deficit

The total resource gap in budgetary operations during 2003

declined to 8 per cent of GDP (Rs.14l billion), Although the

realised resource gap exceeded the original target of 7.5 per

cent of GDP (Rs,l34 billion), it was 0,9 per cent of GDP less

than in 2002 (8.9 per cent of GDP). In financing the resource

gap, net resources available from external sources (loans and

grants) amounted to2.9 per cent of GDP (Rs,5l billion). Totalprivatisation proceeds lealised for the financing of budgetary

operations amounted to 0.6 per cent of GDP (Rs.10.2 billion).

These relatively higher receipts from external sources and theprivatisation programme, as well as the reduction in the total

resource gap during the year contilbuted to lower borrowing in

the domestic market. Total amount of resources raised tn the

domestic sector in 2003 decreased substantially to 4,5 per cenl

of GDP (Rs.79.7 billion) in comparison to 8.0 per cent of GDP

(Rs.126.4 billion) in the previous year. This helped to reducepressure on the domestic financial mat'ket, facilitating

reductions in domestic interest rates and increasing resources

available for private sector investment,In the government borrowing strategy there was an

incleased dependence on market oriented debt instruments.Accordingly, the entire borrowing requirement flom the

domestic market was t'aised through marketable instruments.With the improvement in overall fiscal operations, the debt

dependency, which is measured as the ratio of total borrowings

relative to the total expenditure of the government, declined to

29 per cent in 2003 from 32 per cent in 2002. The combined

impact of the reCuction in the resource gap, improved liquidity

conditions in the ma'ket and the leduction in the Central Bankpolicy rates (Repo and Reverse Repo) helped reduce interestrates on government securities significantly in 2003.

Repayments to the banking system reduced the crowding orrtof private sector investment, and prevented expansionary

pressure on money growth.

Domestic Borrowing

The government policy of financing its borrowing through

market based instruments and reducins non-marketable debt

stock continued in 2003. Accoldingly there was a net

repayment of Rupee loans amounting to Rs.39.3 billion in 2003

in comparison to the net repayment of Rs.5 billion in 2002. Thepolicy of issuing Rupee ioans with an optional letirementfacility was also continued, allowing the government to retire

them early, in a declining interest rate environment. Rupee

loans amounting to Rs.48.1 billion were issued to the marketin 2003, with maturity peLiods ranging from 2-6 years, at

diff'eLent interest rates. In line with the significant teduction in

market interest rates, interest on Rupee loans was also reducedgradually. Institutional investors such as EPF, NSB, ETF and

PSPF continued to be the main investors in the Rupee loan

programme, accounting for 93 per cent of the total investmentin 2003.In 2003, the borrowing strategy of the government wasformulated to laise funds mainly through medium and long-

term marketable debt instluments. As a result, net bon'owingsthrough Treasury bonds increased considerably to Rs.l37

billion fiom Rs.l09 billion in2002. As in the previous year, thepolicy of retiring high cost bon'owings and replacing them with

low cost borrowings continued in 2003. Optional Rupee loans

amounting to Rs.33 billion were retired and outstanding import

bills of Rs.l2 billion were settled during the year and replacedwith domestic rupee borrowings, mainly through Treasury

bonds, aL a lower interest rate. The maturity petiod of Treasury

bonds issued in 2003 varied from 2-20 years with weighted

average yield rates between 6.65 per cent and I0.89 per-cent.

The gap between the weighted aver-age yield lates and coupon

rates narrowed markedly due to improved liquidity in the

malket. Consequently, the cash shortfall in the Treasury bond

programme declined significantly to2.4 per cent of total gross

receipts in comparison to the relatively high cash sholtfall of

7.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The domestic non-bank sector, tncluding institutional investors,

continued to dominate investments in Treasury bonds in 2003.

Net bomowing through Treasury bill issues, on cash value basis

amounted to Rs.l4,9 billion.Government liabilities to the banking system in 2003

declined by Rs.2l billion compared to the previous year's

reduction of Rs.4.8 billion. The availability of funds fromdomestic non-bank sources, decreased borrowing requirementand the overall improvement in the economy were the mainreasons for this improvement. The reduction in net credit togovernment by the banking sector was the net outcome of areduction in liabilities to the central Bank by Rs.29 billion andan increase in Iiabilities of Rs.8 billion to the commercialbanks, The reduction of government riabilities to the centralBank appeared in a decrine in central Bank hordings ofTreasury bills (Rs.28.4 biilion), a marginar increaie inprovisional advances (Rs.0,2 billion) and a build up ofgovelnment deposits with the Central Bank (Rs.0,4 billion).The increase in net bo'rowing from commercial banks (Rs,7.7billion) was a net outcorne of increased investments rngovernment securities and reduced other liabilities to thecommercial banks. commercial banks' investments rnTreasury bills and rreasury bonds in 2003 amounted to Rs.l5.7billion and Rs.25.I billion, respectively. Government's

Foreign BorrowingUtilisat sources tofinance ificantlv in2003. Aonrorei ::'ffi?[';was given to the committee by the government to be raised in2003' The government was able to raise uS dollaLs 995million (Rs.96 billion) for budgetary purpose, of the rotal,foreign loan disbursements, on a gross basis, amounted toRs,88 billion (uS dollars 912 million). Total disbursemenrsincluded uS dollars 100 million (Rs,9.5 billion) from rheNEXI of Japan and US dollars 344 million of concessionarprogramme loans (Rs.33 billion), received from multilateralpayment of foreign borrowingncluding deferred payments ofelated imports in the past.trom foreign sources used forcentral government operations amounted to Rs.43.l billion. asignificant increase when compared with the Rs.2 billion in theprevious year, The higher leve I of foreign loan disbursementswas a lesult of the increased utilisation of available foreignresources- The rate of foreign loan utilisation, as measured bythe ratio of total gross disbursements in a year to the totalcommitted undisbursed balance, increased to 20 per cent in2003 when compared with l4 per cent in the previous year.

Foreign Grants

The amount of foreign grants received for budgetary purposesin 2003 was Rs.7.9 billion. In absolute terms, this was anincrease in contrast to the decreasing trend in the recent past,

As a percentage of GDP, the amount of grants increased to 0.5per cent when compared with 0.4 per cent in the previous year.The governments of Japan, the Netherlands and Germanycontinued to be the leading donors in 2003.

8.8 Government Debt

unlike in the recent past, there has been a containment of theincreasing trend in the government's outstanding debt stock asa percentage of GDP in 2003. The debt to GDp ratio increasedmalginally to 105.9 per cent fiom 105.4 per cent of GDp in2002. The total outstanding government debt stock in nominalferms rncreased by 12 per cent to Rs. 1,864 biilion at end 2003in comparison to Rs.1,670 billion at end 2002. The reductionof government debt was recognised as a priority in thegovernment's policy statement and in the FMRA. Fiscalconsolidation is being implemented to arrest the incr.easing debtand public debt management is being strengthened to supportthe consolidation process. The depreciation of the rupee,especially in the latter part of the year against major ibreigncunencies, and the increase in the net borr-owing requirementhad an expansionary impact on the outstanding debt stock in2003.

In 2003, the main determinants of the debt/GDp ratio, i.e,,the primary deficit of the budget and nominal interest rates,were significantly lower than in 2002. Declining interest rateshelped contain the domestic debt accumulation process anddecreased the domestic debt to GDp ratio to a certain extenr.As in the recent past, exchange rate variation continued to bethe most important factor, determining the rupee value ofexternal debt.

Domestic Debt

The deceleration in domestic borrowing helped lower thegovernment liability to the domestic sector in 2003 to 5g percent of GDP, in comparison to 60 per cent at end 2002,In rupeeterms however, the government domestic debt stock increasedby 7.5 per cent to Rs.1,020 billion, compared to a l6 per centincrease in2002. Following the ma.ket based borrowing policywith longer-term maturity, the share of medium and long-termdebt to total domestic debt increased to 76 per cent fiom 73 percent in 2002. These developme nts will help reduce thevolatility of the debt stock and the bunching of repaymentobligations as well as rollover problems in debt managementin the future,With the continuation of the market oriented borrowingpolicy in 2003, the share of the Treasury bond stock to theoutstanding medium and long-term debt stock increased to 63per cent from 50 per cent in the pr-evious year. In addition, itsshare to total outstanding domestic debt increased to 47 per centtiom 37 per cent in2002.In contrast, there was a net reductionof the Rupee loans srock by Rs.3g billion ro Rs.24g billion,which accounted for 32 per cent of medium and rong-term debtand24 per cent of the total domestic debt in 2003. The EpF andNSB continued as Ieading institutional investors and accounted

amounting to US dollars 158.5 million (Rs.15.2 billion) were

retired in 2003, As a result, the outstanding stock of SLDBs

denominated in US dollars, amounted to US dollars 91.5million at end 2003. Treasury bills continued to be the major

instrument to raise short-term funds from the domestic debt

market and accounted for 22 per cent of the total domestic debt

stock in 2003 (Rs.2l9 billion). Although the bon'owing policy

was expected to rely more on medium to long-term marketabledebt, the share of Treasury bills as a percentage of the

outstanding domestic debt stock remained almost unchanged

due to new issues of Tr-easury bills. The outstanding amount of

provisional advances to the government by the Central Bank at

end 2003 amounted to Rs.31.2, billion, in comparison to the

available ceiling of Rs.33 billion. This was an increase of

Rs.0,2 billion fiom end 2002. These advances are provided fieeof interest to the government by the Central Bank.

Government outstanding liabilities to the banking system

declined by 8 per cent to Rs.228 billion and accounted lor 22

per cent of the total domestic debt stock in comparison to 26

per cent in the previous year'. The decline was mainly drivenby a 42 per cent decrease in government liabilities to the

Central Bank after the release of its holding of government

seculities to the market in open market operations. In contrast,

the government's liability to commercial banks increased by 7per cent to Rs.l84 billion in 2003, as commercial banksincreased their investments in government securities.Government liabilities to commercial banks by way ofoverdraft facilities (Rs.2 billion) and import bills (Rs.0.2billion) declined. The share of government liability to

commercial banks as a percentage of the domestic debt stock

was l8 per cent. Total outstanding non-instrument debt to

commercial banks decleased to Rs.38 billion in 2003 from

Rs.54 billion in 2002. Of this, FCBU bolrowins amounted to

Rs.29 billion.

Foreign Debt

In 2003, the outstanding stock of foreign debt increased by l7per cent to Rs.844 billion, mainly due to exchange rate

variations. The sharp depreciation of the rupee against the

Japanese yen and the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDR),

increased the rupee value of the foreign debt stock by Rs.68billion (3.9 per cent of GDP). As a percentage of GDP, the

outstanding stock of government foreign debt increased to 47.9

per cent in 2003, fiom 45.6 per cent in2002.Of the total fbreign debt stock, the share of concessional

loans increased to 98 per cent from 97 per cent in the previousyear. The outstanding stock of non-concessional loans

decreased mainly due to lower outstanding det'ence relatedloans, as there were no new loans contracted due to the

ceasefire. Japan continued to be the majol bilateral donor and

provider of concessional loans, accountingfor 32 per cent of

the total foreign debt. Japan was fbllowed by IDA and ADB,

the major multilateral donors, accounting for 24 per cent and

23 per cent of the total foreign debt stock, respectively. Project

loans, from bilateral and multilateral sources, constituted the

major part of the total foreign debt portfblio, accounting fbr 91

per cent of the total foreign debt stock,

Exchange rate variations have been the most clitical issue

in increasing the foreign debt stock in the past. Although the

value of rupee depreciated only marginally against the USdollar in 2003, the amount of government foreign debt

denominated in US dollars was only 15 per cent, limiting its

favourable impact on debt. As the amount of foreign debt

denominated in Japanese yen and SDR was 75 per cent (3't per

cent and 4l per cent, respectively), the higher rate of

depreciation of the rupee against these two cun'encies (12.7 per

cent and l0.l per cent, respectively) increased the rupee valueof fbreign debt significantly in 2003.

Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments in 2003 amounted to Rs'345

billion (Rs.125 billion of intelest payments and Rs.220 billionof amortisation payments), an increase of 2l per cent over

2002. As a percentage of GDP, the increase was from 17.9 per

cent in 2002 to 19.6 per cent in 2003. Total debt service

payments exceeded total government revenue for the second

consecutive year, reflecting the declining trend in revenue and

increased debt service payments. This large increase in debtselvice payments was mainly due to the weak fiscal

performance and high cost borrowing with relatively short

maturity periods seen in the recent past. In addition, the eaLly

retirement of high cost debt also contributed to increase cunent

debt service payments although this would have long-run

benefits, After debt service payments, all other expenses of the

government were paid by borrowing' The high level of debt

service payments restricted fund allocation for the public

investment plogramme of the government, reducing the future

growth prospects of the economy.

The increase in debt service payments was mainly on

account of higher amortisation payments on domestic debt,which increased by Rs.52 billion when compared with the

previous year. The significantly higher amount of amortisation

payments, in2002 as well as in 2003, was mainly a result of

the bunching of maturities of high cost borrowing in 2000 and

early 2001, when domestic market interest rates were at very

high levels and the early retirement of high cost debt' However,

this problem will ease fiom 2004, with measures to smoothen

the maturity structure of the outstanding debt.In 2003, interest payments amounted to Rs.l25 billion

(7.1 per cent of GDP), a 7,3 per cent increase when compat'edwith the plevious year. Interest payments are the single

largest expenditure item, accounting for about 45 per cent ofgovernment revenue in 2003. As a result, only half the

govemmen[ revenue was available for other expenditure items

of the government. However, interest payments on short-termdebt decreased by l7 per cent, from the previous year,

reflecting the reduction in short-term debt and the declining

interest rates during the year. Interest payments on medium to

long-term debt increased by l6 pel cent in 2003. Treasury

bonds issued during the period of high interest rates in 2000

and 2001, and scheduled to mature in 2003, were the main

reasons for the increase in interest payments on medium and

long-term debt.Foreign debt service payments, as a ratio of export of

goods and services decreased to 7.3 per cent in 2003 from 8'3

per cent in2002 due to lower amortisation payments in 2003.

The reduction in foreign amortisation payments was mainly

due to a reduction in deferred payments on def'ence imports in2003. Government policy of higheL dependence on

concessional borrowing will help to lower foreign debt service

payments in the future.

Public Sector Debt

The outstanding debt stock of the public sector, which includes

the central government and non-financial public corporations'

amounted to Rs.1,905 billion at end 2003' Of this, Rs'40'6

CEB, CpC and CWE, continued to be major

public corporation debtors, accounting for 67 .4 per cent of thetotal public corporations' debt.
