During 2007, PDDmobilized a sum of Rs. 411 billion through domesticsources and Rs. 199.7 billion through foreign sourcesin terms of book value and maintained totalborrowings within the original borrowing target.However, due to the high yield rates that prevailedin the domestic market, in line with the rising inflationand tight monetary policy stance, PDD had to deviateto a certain extent from its initial domestic borrowingplan, relying more on short-term debt instruments,non-marketable instruments, foreign currencydenominated debt instruments and foreigninvestments on Treasury bonds. Thus, Rs. 23.3billion was raised as rupee loans and Rs. 37 billionwas raised as Treasury bills as against the originalborrowing targets of Rs. 10 billion and Rs. 5 billionrespectively. In addition, borrowings through SLDBsamounted to Rs. 23.6 billion in comparison to theoriginal target of Rs. 10.5 billion. In contrast, theborrowings through Treasury bonds were low, witha value of Rs. 302 billion as against the original targetof Rs. 356 billion (in book value terms). However,out of these Treasury bonds 61 per cent falls in tomaturities above 3 years, showing the appetite offoreign investors to invest in longer term bonds dueto attractive rates.

This led to a duplication of work andconfusion in the minds of the general public, whentwo government bodies released two different growthstatistics in the country. The international practicefollowed by many countries has been to compile thenational income statistics by the national statisticalbureau of the country. It is appropriate that Sri Lankatoo follow the same practice. Accordingly, theCentral Bank decided to use national incomeestimates compiled by the DCS from 2007 in itsanalysis of the performance of the economy, whilecontinuing only forecasting GDP for assessing futuregrowth performance and macroeconomicmanagement. Accordingly, the Department continuedwith the analysing of growth trends in CBSLpublications and provided growth projections whenrequired. This practice is consistent with that adaptedin the compilation of price indices and assessing andforecasting inflation. While the DCS compiles theactual price indices and inflation, the CBSL makesuse of them in assessing and forecasting movementsin inflation, for monetary policy purposes.",
