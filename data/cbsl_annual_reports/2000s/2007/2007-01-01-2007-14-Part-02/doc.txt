1.1Accountability and the Financial Performance ofthe Central Bank of Sri Lanka in relation to theObjectives

The Central Bank was established as the authorityresponsible for the administration, supervision andregulation of the monetary, financial and paymentsystems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act.In accordance with this Act, the Bank is chargedwith the responsibility of securing the core objectivesof economic and price stability and financial systemstability.

The basis of accountability for the Central Bank andthe success of its operations therefore would be theeffectiveness of its policies and operations leadingtowards the achievement of its core objectives andnot necessarily its profitability per se. These statutoryobjectives are the fundamental features thatdistinguish the Central Bank from any other entity,private or public. Accordingly, profitability related

approach, if adopted by the Central Bank, couldresult in the Bank pursuing profits whilecompromising its core objectives, since it has theunique ability to create its own profits through itsmonetary policy activities, which could influenceinterest rates and exchange rates. It therefore followsthat the Central Bank’s objectives of economic andprice stability and financial system stability need tobe distinguished and detached from the pureprofitability objective which should essentially beincidental or academic only.

In this background, the Central Bank’s financialstatements record results in the implementation ofits monetary policy operations, exchange ratemanagement, issuing of currency, etc. at the valuesas realized and hence, the financial performance asreported in these statements needs to be interpretedand understood in that context.

1.2Reporting Entity and Statutory Base

These are the financial statements of the CentralBank of Sri Lanka (“Bank” or “CBSL”), theinstitution established under the Monetary Law ActNo 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka as amended (“MLA”),as the authority responsible for the administrationsupervision and regulation of monetary, financial andpayment system of Sri Lanka. Central Bank of SriLanka is domiciled in the Democratic SocialistRepublic of Sri Lanka and situated at No: 30,Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 01.

These financial statements were authorised for issueby the Governor and Chief Accountant on 18thMarch 2008.

1.3Accounting Policies

1.3.1Basis of preparation

The financial statements are prepared on thehistorical cost basis, except for land & building andcertain financial assets that have been measured atfair value as identified in specific accounting policiesbelow.

Reporting Format

The Bank presents financial assets and financialliabilities, and their associated income and expensestreams, by distinguishing between foreign currencyand local currency activities. In the balance sheetassets & liabilities are presented broadly in order ofliquidity within such distinguished category. TheBank considers that this reporting approach provideappropriate reporting of the Bank's activities whichare more fully described in Note 1.5.

Statement of Compliance

The financial statements of the Central Bank of SriLanka for the year ended 31 December 2007 havebeen prepared in accordance with InternationalFinancial Reporting Standard (IFRS).

Currency of Presentation

All amounts in Sri Lanka Rupees are expressed inthousands, unless otherwise stated.

1.3.2. Significant Accounting Judgments and Estimates

In the process of applying the accounting policies,the bank has made the following judgments apartfrom those involving estimations, which have themost significant effect on the amounts recognizedin the financial statements.

Impairment of Available for Sale Investments

The Bank determines that Available for SaleInvestments are impaired when there has been a

significant or prolonged decline in the fair valuebelow its cost. This determination of what issignificant or prolonged requires judgment.

Pensions and Other Post Employment BenefitPlans

The cost of defined benefit plans is determined usingan actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuationinvolves making assumptions about discount rates,expected rates of return on assets, futurecompensation increases, mortality rates and futurepension increases. Due to the long-term nature ofthese plans, such estimates are subject to significantuncertainty.

1.3.3Adoption of Amended IFRS during the year

The accounting policies adopted are consistent withthose used in the previous year. The Bank adoptedIFRS 7: Financial Instruments- Disclosures &complementary amendments to IAS1, Presentationof Financial Statements Capital Disclosures.

The Principal effects of these changes are as follows:

IFRS - 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures

This standard requires disclosures that enable usersof the financial statements to evaluate the significantof the Bank’s financial instruments and the natureand extend of risks arising from those financialinstruments. The new disclosures are includedthrough out the financial statements. While there hasbeen no effect on the financial position or results,comparative information has been revised whereneeded.

IAS-1 Presentation of financial statements

This amendment requires the group to make newdisclosures to enable uses of the financial statementsto evaluate the group’s objectives, policies andprocesses for managing capital.

1.3.4Standards, interpretations and amendments topublished standards that are not yet effective

Certain new standards, amendments andinterpretations to existing standards have beenpublished that are applicable for the Bank’saccounting periods beginning on or after 1 January2008 or later periods but which the Bank has notearly adopted, as follows:

IFRS 8, Operating Segments (effective from 1January 2009) – IFRS 8 specifies how an entityshould report information about its operatingsegments in the annual financial statements. TheBank is in the process of assessing the impact ofIFRS 8 and its voluntary application.

1.4Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

1.4.1Foreign Currency Conversions

Bank’s functional and presentation currency is SriLanka Rupees (Rs). Transactions in foreigncurrencies are initially recorded in the functionalcurrency ruling at the date of transaction. Monetaryassets and liabilities denominated in foreigncurrencies are retranslated at the rate of exchangeruling at the balance sheet date. All differences aretaken to the Income Statement. For the purposes ofretranslation the following Sri Lanka rupee exchangerates for major currencies were used:

financial assets that require delivery of assets withinthe time frame generally established by regulationor convention in the market place.

Securities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial assets classified as held for trading areincluded in the category securities at fair valuethrough profit or loss. These securities aresubsequently valued at quoted market prices.Changes in market value are recognised as anincrease or decrease in the value of the securities inthe Balance Sheet while resulting gains and lossesare recognised in the Income Statement.

Where the security is still owned, the gain or loss isreported as Gain /(Loss) from Unrealised PriceRevaluations. Where the gain or loss has beenrealised (through selling the security), this is reportedas Gain /(Loss) Realised from Price Changes.

Foreign Currency Available-for-Sale Investments

Foreign currency available for sale investments aresubsequently valued at quoted market prices.Changes in market value are recognised as anincrease or decrease in the value of the available forsale securities in the Balance Sheet under reserves.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the marketvalue of foreign currency available-for-saleinvestments are recognised on a separate componentof equity (shown under Other Reserves in theBalance Sheet) until the investment is sold, collectedor otherwise disposed of, or until the investment isdetermined to be impaired, at which time thecumulative gain or loss previously reported as equityis included in income.

Securities denominated in Gold

Gold securities held with foreign counter parties areinitially stated at cost. Gains and losses arising fromchanges in the market value of Gold Securities arerecognised in the Income Statement. Where the GoldSecurities are still owned, the gain or loss is reportedas Gain /(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations.Where the gain or loss has been realised (throughselling the Gold Securities), this is reported as Gain/(Loss) Realised from Price Changes.

Derivative Instruments

The Bank’s involvement in derivative instrumentsis mainly in forward foreign exchange contracts.Such derivative financial instruments are stated atfair value. The fair value of forward exchangecontracts is calculated by reference to currentforward exchange rates for contracts with similarmaturity profiles. All derivative instruments in a gain

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms ofhistorical cost in a foreign currency are translatedusing exchange rates at the dates of initialtransactions.

1.4.2Financial Assets and Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities,and the associated income and expense streams, bydistinguishing between foreign currency and localcurrency activities. Foreign currency activitiesmainly arise from the Bank’s foreign reservesmanagement function. Local currency activitiesmainly reflect the assets and liabilities associatedwith monetary policy implementation, issuingcurrency and banking activities.

The separate reporting of these activities isconsidered to provide a better presentation of theBank’s financial position, financial performance andrisk profile. The Bank considers that the combinedreporting of foreign and local currency activitieswould weaken the informational value of thefinancial statements.

All financial assets are initially recognised at cost,being the fair value of the consideration given andincluding acquisition charges associated with theinvestment. Subsequent measurement bases afterinitial recognition are described below. All regularway purchases and sales of financial assets arerecognised on the trade date respectively. Regularway purchases or sales are purchases or sales of

or loss position, if any, are reported within thebalance of foreign currency trading or available forsale securities in the Balance Sheet.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) RelatedBalances

The Bank transacts with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) in its own right rather than as an agentfor the Government of Sri Lanka. All transactionsby the Bank with the IMF have been included inthese financial statements on that basis.

The Bank as an asset records quota with the IMFand the amount payable to the IMF for quota isrecorded as a liability of the Bank. The cumulativeallocation of SDRs by the IMF is treated as a liability.Exchange gains and losses arising on revaluation ofIMF assets and liabilities at the exchange rateapplying at balance sheet date as published by theIMF are recognised in the Income Statement.

All other charges and interest pertaining to balanceswith the IMF are recorded immediately in theIncome Statement.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreignbanks and financial institutions and short-termdeposits.

As a part of local currency activities CBSL generatescertain income and incurs expenses, which do notinvolve in movement of cash. Those activities resultin certain assets and liabilities and mainly compriseof the transactions with the Government of Sri Lanka(GOSL) and transactions with domestic banks andfinancial institutions. Transactions with GOSLinclude the purchase of un-subscribed portions ofTreasury bills and bonds that are issued by theGovernment by the Bank as a monetary policymechanism. Such purchases, disposals or interestthereon are reflected as mere book entries in therecords of CBSL.

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues currencyto the public in line with Monetary Law Act.Currency issued by CBSL represents a claim on thebank in favour of the holder. This is a liability onthe part of the CBSL while it is an item of cash inthe hands of the holder. Movement in circulationcurrency is included as part of financing activitiesin line with prevailing industry practice among thosecentral banks which present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disbursescash in the form of Notes and Coins or chequesdrawn on CBSL, to various drawees includingsuppliers and employees for goods and services

obtained, which is either added to the currency incirculation liability or Deposits by Banks andFinancial Institutions. Such forms of utilization ofcurrency for the purposes of CBSL’s payments formpart of cash outflows of CBSL.

For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, cashand cash equivalents consist of cash and cashequivalents as defined above, net of cash/ pay orderoutflows.

Repurchase and Reverse-RepurchaseTransactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchasecontinue to be recorded as assets in the BalanceSheet. The obligation to repurchase (Securities SoldUnder Agreements to Repurchase) is disclosed as aliability. The difference between the sale andrepurchase price in repurchase transactions and thepurchase price and sale price in reverse-repurchasetransactions represents an expense and incomerespectively and recognised in the Income Statement.

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreementsare recorded as an asset in the Balance Sheet(Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Re-sell).Both repurchase and reverse-repurchase transactionsare reported at the transaction value inclusive of anyaccrued income or expense.

Investment Portfolio – Sri Lanka GovernmentSecurities

The Bank’s investment portfolio consists of treasurybills and bonds purchased from Government of SriLanka. The portfolio is recorded in the BalanceSheet at amortised cost since they represent loansprovided to the GOSL.

Advances to Government

Advances to Government represents directprovisional advances made to Government of SriLanka under Section 89 of the Monetary Law ActNo 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended.

Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognisedand carried at the original granted amount less anallowance for any uncollectible amounts. Anallowance for doubtful debts (for loan impairment)is established if there is objective evidence that theBank will not be able to collect all amounts due.The amount of the allowance is the differencebetween the carrying amount and the estimatedrecoverable amount. Bad debts are written off whenidentified.

Securities Lending

Transfer of securities to counterparties under lendingtransactions is only reflected on the balance sheet ifthe risks and rewards of ownership are alsotransferred.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each balance sheet datewhether a financial asset is impaired.

Assets carried at Amortised Cost

If there is objective evidence that an impairment losson loans and receivables carried at amortised costhas been incurred, the amount of the loss is measuredas the difference between the asset’s carrying amountand the present value of estimated future cash flows(excluding future credit losses that have not beenincurred) discounted at the financial asset’s originaleffective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest ratecomputed at initial recognition). The carryingamount of the asset shall be reduced either directlyor through use of an allowance account. The amountof the loss shall be recognised in the IncomeStatement.

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidenceof impairment exists individually for financial assetsthat are individually significant, and individually orcollectively for financial assets that are notindividually significant. If it is determined that noobjective evidence of impairment exists for anindividually assessed financial asset, whethersignificant or not, the asset is included in a group offinancial assets with similar credit risk characteristicsand that group of financial assets is collectivelyassessed for impairment. Assets that are individuallyassessed for impairment and for which animpairment loss is or continues to be recognised arenot included in a collective assessment ofimpairment.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of theimpairment loss decreases and the decrease can berelated objectively to an event occurring after theimpairment was recognised, the previouslyrecognised impairment loss is reversed. Anysubsequent reversal of an impairment loss isrecognised in the income statement, to the extentthat the carrying value of the asset does not exceedits amortised cost at the reversal date.

Available-for-Sale Investments

If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amountcomprising the difference between its cost (net ofany principal payment and amortisation) and its

current fair value, less any impairment losspreviously recognized in profit or loss, is transferredfrom equity to the income statement. Reversals inrespect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in profit. Reversals ofimpairment losses on debt instruments are reversedthrough profit or loss, if the increase in fair value ofthe instrument can be objectively related to an eventoccurring after the impairment loss was recognisedin profit or loss.

Foreign Currency Term Liabilities

Foreign currency term liabilities are subsequentlyreported at the amortised cost of the liabilities.Changes in the value of these liabilities arerecognised as an increase or decrease in the valueof the term liabilities in the Balance Sheet. Gainsand losses arising from changes in value of foreigncurrency term liabilities are recognised immediatelyas expenses in the Income Statement. Where theliability is still owed, the gain or loss is reported as(Gain) /Loss from Unrealised Price Revaluation.Where the gain or loss has been realised (throughrepayment of the liability), this is reported as (Gains)/Losses Realised from Price Changes.

Financial Guarantees

Financial Guarantees are initially recognised in thefinancial statements at fair value, under OtherPayables, at fair value. Subsequent to initialrecognition, the Bank’s liability under eachguarantee is measured at the best estimate ofexpenditure required to settle any financialobligation arising as a result of the guarantee.

Other Financial Assets and Liabilities

Local and foreign currency cash, deposits and short-term advances are recognised on trade date.

1.4.3Other Assets and Liabilities

Investments in Associates

The Bank’s investments in associates, together withthe ones that are held for subsequent disposals areaccounted for under cost method.

Gold Inventory

Gold inventory, which is a highly liquid commodity,is carried at cost.

Such cost includes the cost ofreplacing part of such Property, Plant and Equipmentwhen that cost is incurred if the recognition criteriaare met. Land and buildings are measured at fairvalue less depreciation on Buildings and impairmentcharged subsequent to the date of the revaluation.

Except for the freehold land, depreciation iscalculated on a straight-line method over thefollowing estimated useful lives.

Intangible Assets

Computer software not integral to computerhardware are shown as intangible assets andrecognized at cost. Following initial recognitionthese intangible assets are carried at cost less anyaccumulated amortization based on a useful life of4 years.

Receivables

Receivables are carried at expected realisable valueafter making due allowance for doubtful debts, basedon objective evidence.

Sundry Assets

Sundry assets are carried at expected realisablevalues.

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each reporting date if eventsor changes in circumstances indicate that thecarrying value may be impaired, whether there is anindication that a non-financial asset may be impaired.If any such indication exists, the Bank makes anestimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Wherethe carrying amount of an asset exceeds itsrecoverable amount, the asset is considered impairedand is written down to its recoverable amount.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has apresent obligation (legal or constructive) as a resultof a past event, it is probable that an outflow ofresources embodying economic benefits will berequired to settle the obligation and a reliableestimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.Where the Bank expects a provision to bereimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as aseparate asset but only when the reimbursement isvirtually certain.

Currency in Circulation

The carrying values of plant and equipment arereviewed for impairment when events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carrying value maynot be recoverable. Following initial recognition atcost, land and buildings are carried at a revaluedamount, which is the fair value at the date of therevaluation less any subsequent accumulateddepreciation on buildings and subsequentaccumulated impairment losses.

Valuations are performed frequently enough toensure that the fair value of a revalued asset doesnot differ materially from its carrying amount.

Any revaluation surplus is credited to theRevaluation Reserve included in the equity sectionof the Balance Sheet, except to the extent that itreverses a revaluation decrease of the same assetpreviously recognised in Income Statement, in whichcase the increase is recognised in Income Statement.A revaluation deficit is recognised in IncomeStatement, except that a deficit directly offsetting aprevious surplus on the same asset is directly offsetagainst the surplus in the Revaluation Reserve. Upondisposal, any revaluation surplus relating to theparticular asset being sold is transferred to retainedearnings. An item of Property, Plant and Equipmentis de-recognised upon disposal or when no futureeconomic benefits are expected from its use ordisposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognitionof the asset (calculated as the difference betweenthe net disposal proceeds and the carrying amountof the asset) is included in the Income Statement in

Actuarial valuations are carriedout once in every three years

The Past service cost is recognised as an expenseon a straight-line basis over the average period untilthe benefits become vested. If the benefits are alreadyvested immediately following the introduction of,or changes to, a benefit plan, past service cost isrecognised immediately.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experienceadjustments and changes in actuarial assumptionsin excess of the greater of 10% of the value of planassets or 10% of the defined benefit obligation arecharged or credited to income over the employees’expected average remaining working lives, in asystematic method that results in faster recognitionof actuarial gains and losses.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Bank contributes 24% and 3% ofemployees’ gross emoluments to Employees’Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fundrespectively which are separately administereddefined contribution plans.

Grants

Grants recognised at their fair value (where there isa reasonable assurance that the grant will be receivedand all attaching conditions, if any, will be compliedwith) are shown under equity. When the grant relatesto an expense item it is recognised in the IncomeStatement over the periods necessary to match themto the expenses it is intended to compensate on asystematic basis. Where the grant relates to an asset,the fair value is credited to a deferred governmentgrant account and is released to the IncomeStatement over the expected useful life of therelevant asset on a systematic basis consistent withthe depreciation policy of the related asset.

Personnel Expenses

Personnel Expenses include the full cost of all staffbenefits. Salaries and related expenses due at year-end are included in other local payables.

Operating Leases

Where the Bank is the lessee, the lease rentalspayable on operating leases are recognised in theIncome Statement over the term of the lease on abasis consistent with the expected benefits derivedfrom the leased assets.

the development of the productive resources of SriLanka, can be broadly segregated into foreigncurrency and local currency activities. Results ofthese activities are taken to mean OperatingActivities in the context of the Income Statement

Foreign Currency Activities

Foreign currency activities result mainly from theCentral Bank of Sri Lanka’s holdings of foreigncurrency assets under its foreign reservesmanagement function. The foreign reservesmanagement portfolio comprises foreign currencyassets held for foreign exchange interventionpurposes and other foreign currency assets held fortrading purposes.

The foreign currency assets are held in variouscurrencies. The majorities are denominated in UnitedStates Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds and JapaneseYen. The financial instruments held within theseforeign currency portfolios consist mainly ofsovereign securities, securities held under reverse-repurchase transactions or balances held with othercentral banks, commercial banks and custodialinstitutions.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka also holds, from time-to-time, foreign currency assets and liabilities thatarise from international market operations.

Local Currency Activities

Local currency activities arise as follows:

(i)Liquidity management operations. Liquiditymanagement largely involves the Central Bankof Sri Lanka offsetting the daily net flows to orfrom government or market by advancing fundsto or withdrawing funds from the bankingsystem. Most of this business is undertakenthrough daily open market operations.

(ii) Holding an investment portfolio comprising SriLanka government securities to support theliability for currency in circulation. The Bank’spolicy is to hold these investments for monetaryoperations and not for trading.

Trust and Custodial Activities

2.BANK SUPERVISION

The regulatory and supervisory function of theCentral Bank relating to banks licensed by theMonetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka(CBSL) is carried out by the Bank SupervisionDepartment (BSD), with a view to ensuring the safetyand soundness of the banking system, and promotingfinancial system stability. As at end 2007, 38 licensedbanks, i.e., 23 licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and15 licensed specialized banks (LSBs), were inoperation under the regulation and supervision of theCentral Bank.

These banks, in alphabetical order, are at Annex I.

The activities of the BSD include enforcingregulatory and supervisory requirements, adoptingnew regulatory and supervisory measures, grantingregulatory approvals and implementing risk basedsupervision through continuous monitoring andexamination of banks. A summary of the activitiesundertaken in 2007 is given below.

2.1Prudential Regulation

The BSD issued several new prudential regulationsand guidelines, as well as amendments to existingprudential requirements, to the licensed banks in2007. Details are contained in Part III of this reportand a summary is as follows.

a.Limits on share ownership in banks: A new shareownership scheme with regard to shares carryingvoting rights was introduced with the objectiveof promoting better corporate governance andto address any conflicts of interest that may arisedue to large shareholdings. Accordingly, themaximum percentage of ownership permitted inthe issued share capital carrying voting rights willbe 15 per cent of issued share capital. However,to acquire shares in excess of 10 per cent, theapproval of the Monetary Board (MB) and theconcurrence of the Hon. Minister of Finance willbe required. The MB may grant permission toacquire more than 15 per cent of the share capitalof a bank which requires restructuring to avoidinadequacy of capital, insolvency or potentialfailure, subject to conditions.

b.Maximum amount of accommodation: Criteriaadopted in determining the maximum amount ofaccommodation were revised with the view tomitigating banks’ credit concentration risk. Themaximum amount of accommodation to a singlecounter-party and for a group of companies willbe 30 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively, ofthe capital base of the bank.

5.2Cost effective measures for issuing and managingcurrency:

During the year, the CRD has adopted the followingmeasures to reduce the issuing cost of currency.

(a) Mobilizing idle coins into circulation. Cost ofminting coins has been escalating significantlyin recent times mainly due to rising internationalmetal and energy prices. To address this situationthe Currency Department (CRD) started anisland-wide program to bring coins lying idle inhouseholds and religious places into circulationso that a significant part of the annual cost ofminting coins in UK Pounds could be saved.CRD was able to collect idle coins worth Rs. 28.6mn. from eight districts during the year.

The coin collection program was conductedthrough school network using school children tomobilize idle coins accumulated in householdsfor re-circulation. Commercial banks, otherbanks and non-bank public institutions wereinvolved in these programmes. The schoolnetwork was selected, as it could deliver multiplebenefits, such as improving awareness oncurrency, counterfeiting and clean note policyamong the school children, inculcating savingand banking habits among them, supporting themto improve their extra curricular activities andusing children as the vehicle for transmitting theknowledge on currency to the rest of the society.

(b) Melting slow moving and low value scrap coins.There was a significant amount of slow movingaluminum coins in the denominations of Cts. 10and 5 in CRD vaults occupying a large floorspace. CRD melted a stock of these coins withthe support of the Industrial Development Board(IDB) which purchased aluminum ingots to beissued to prospective buyers. The CRD collectedaround Rs. 3.0 mn. from those sales.

6.1Implementation of Monetary Policy

(a)Open Market Operations (OMO)

The department continued to conduct OMO withinthe framework of market based monetary policyoperations introduced in 2003. During the year, OMOwere conducted aggressively to absorb liquidity as astrategy for maintaining reserve money within thetargets. Accordingly, while conducting auctions forrepurchase (REPO) transactions to absorb liquidityon a daily basis, Treasury bills out of the holdings ofthe Central Bank were sold in the secondary marketthrough auctions to absorb liquidity on a permanentbasis. REPO transactions under the standing facilitytoo were continued. In line with this strategy, auctionswere not conducted to release funds through reverserepurchase (Reverse REPO) transactions, whilestanding facility for the same was made available onlyon days when there was a liquidity shortfall and onlyup to the estimated shortfall.

Licensed commercial banks continued to be theeligible Participating Institutions (PIs) in OMOactivities. In addition, primary dealers who had beenexcluded from OMO activities since 19 June 2006were re-enlisted as eligible PIs with effect from 23August 2007.

The Central Bank’s policy rates, i.e., the REPO andReverse REPO Rates, were increased by 50 basispoints each to 10.5 per cent and 12 per cent,respectively, in February 2007 and maintained at thesame level throughout the rest of the year.

The overall liquidity position in the banking system,on average, remained at a surplus level during theyear (Chart II – 1). The liquidity surplus in May,increased substantially from its average of about Rs.5 bn. in the previous months to about Rs. 12.5 bn.,

mainly due to the return of currency after the heavydraw down of same to meet the festive demand andnet foreign loan disbursements. The liquidity surplusin November, on average, increased to more thanRs. 8 bn. due to the inflow of foreign funds from theissue of international Sovereign bonds of US$ 500mn. by end October. Meanwhile, there weresignificant liquidity shortages on most of the days inApril, September and October, mainly due to the highdemand for currency during the festive season, saleof foreign currency by the Central Bank andrepayment of foreign loans.

The DOD continued to conduct auctions for REPOtransactions in order to absorb any temporaryliquidity surplus in the banking system on a dailybasis. The excess liquidity recorded on most daysduring the year was absorbed through daily auctionsby selling Treasury bills on a repurchase basis. Onaverage, about Rs. 7.4 billion, which representednearly the estimated liquidity surplus, was offered tothe auction on a daily basis. The amount absorbedfrom these auctions, on average, was about Rs. 6.1billion and represented 80.2 per cent of the estimatedliquidity surplus. The weighted average yield rate ofthe auctions, which were around 11.35 per cent atthe beginning of the year, increased by about 50 basispoints following the increase in policy rates inFebruary and stood at around 11.87 per cent by theend of the year (Chart II - 2).

Reverse REPO Transactions

Reverse REPO auctions were not held during the year2007.

(ii) Standing Facilities

PIs, which were unable to manage their short-termliquidity requirements fully through the inter-bankmoney market and the daily OMO auctions, wereprovided the opportunity of obtaining standing

Part II

facilities. These facilities were provided at the REPOand Reverse REPO rates of the Central Bank.

REPO Transactions

PIs that were not successful or unable to participateat the REPO auction resorted to investing in thestanding facility at the REPO rate of the Central Bank.Since the major portion of excess liquidity wasabsorbed by conducting daily auctions for REPOtransactions under the OMO, REPO transactionsunder the standing facility were limited, on average,to about Rs. 0.75 billion per day.

Reverse REPO Transactions

The Reverse REPO Facility (RRF) of the CentralBank under the standing facility is made available toPIs in order to meet their temporary liquidity needsonly as a last resort. However, since it was observedthat certain banks utilised the standing facility as aregular source of funding even when there was aliquidity surplus in the system, PIs were advised tolimit the use of the RRF under the standing facilityand confine their operations to the resourcesavailable.

In order to discourage the use of RRF, the CentralBank decided to make this facility available only ondays when there is a liquidity shortfall in the system,with effect from January 2007. In addition, the totalamount provided by the Central Bank under the RRFon a particular day was limited to the liquidityshortage in the system as per the Bank’s estimates.The RRF was made available to a particular bankonly up to six times per calendar month until 31March 2007 and up to three times per calendar monththereafter, at the Reverse REPO rate of the CentralBank. The restrictions on the number of times that aparticular PI could borrow under the RRF during amonth were withdrawn on 23rdAugust 2007.

In order to strike a balance between the need fordiscouraging the excessive use of the RRF andmeeting the liquidity requirements of PIs, the CentralBank subsequently decided to provide the RRF, atthe reverse REPO rate, up to four times per calendarmonth per participant and beyond this limit at a penalrate of 19 per cent per annum, which is to be reviewedperiodically and changed in accordance with theprevailing monetary conditions, with effect from 3rd

December 2007.

As a consequence of the measures implemented bythe Central Bank, the use of the RRF under thestanding facility had declined substantially from Rs.382 billion in 2006 to Rs. 173 billion during the year2007.

(iii) Outright Transactions

The Central Bank conducted outright auctions to sellTreasury bills out of its own portfolio, in order toabsorb excess liquidity on a permanent basis. TheBank commenced to conduct multiple maturityauctions to sell Treasury bills in January 2007. Thetotal value of Treasury bills sold through theseauctions during the year amounted to Rs. 110.9 bn.The tenure of these bills was very short-term withthe remaining days to maturity ranging from 10 to157 days. These sales were at yield rates, which werebelow the rates comparable with prevailing weightedaverage yield rates for 91 day Treasury bills in theprimary market at the time of each outright sale.

(b)Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR)

The department continued to enforce the SRR, whichwas stipulated at 10 per cent of deposit liabilities ofcommercial banks, denominated in Sri Lanka rupees.

(c)Bank Rate

The Central Bank’s rate of interest (Bank rate) onshort term advances to licensed commercial banks,stipulated under Section 87 of the Monetary Law Act,remained unchanged at 15 per cent. However, thisrate was inoperative as no bank resorted to borrowingfrom the Central Bank at the Bank rate.

6.2Functioning as Banker to Commercial Banks andthe Government

(a)Accounts of Financial Institutions

In order to facilitate the Central Bank’s role of beingthe Banker to commercial banks, the departmentcontinued to provide current account facilities tocommercial banks and primary dealers to ensure anefficient inter-bank payment and settlement system.These accounts were operated on a Real Time GrossSettlement (RTGS) basis within the automatedgeneral ledger system of the Bank.

(b)Government Accounts

In functioning as the Banker to the government, thedepartment maintained the accounts of governmentdepartments, government agencies and institutionsand certain statutory boards, providing them withrequired banking facilities. As at end December 2007,the total number of such accounts maintained by theBank amounted to 38. One new account was opened,whilst one was closed during the year at the requestof the government. The Bank continued to provideprovisional advances to the government, free ofinterest, in terms of Section 89 of the Monetary LawAct. The limit on such advances (10 per cent of theestimated government revenue) was increased byRs. 12.2 bn. to Rs. 62 bn. in 2007.

Provision of Intra Day Liquidity Facility (ILF)

Commercial banks and primary dealers wereprovided the ILF, to ensure the smooth and efficientoperations of the RTGS system. The ILF wasprovided free of charge against the collateral ofGovernment Treasury bills and bonds.

The total value of ILF drawn during the yearamounted to Rs. 1,222 bn. in comparison to Rs. 538.6bn. during the preceding year. The average value ofILF drawn per day was about Rs. 5.03 bn. (Chart II –3).

14.INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

14.1 Foreign Exchange Reserve Management

The Monetary Law Act requires the Central Bank tomaintain an adequate international reserve in liquidcurrencies and a nuclear reserve in gold in order tofacilitate maintenance of external stability of the SriLanka rupee and to assure the greatest possiblefreedom of the country’s international transactions.The responsibility of managing the official foreignexchange reserves of the country is entrusted withInternational Operations Department (IOD) in orderto achieve the above objectives.

In 2007, the foreign exchange reserves composed ofcurrencies such as US dollars, euros, sterling pounds,Australian dollars and gold while the reserves wereinvested mainly in two asset classes i.e., FixedIncome Securities (FIS) and money marketinstruments. Bank’s FIS portfolio consisted of highlyrated sovereign government securities, governmentguaranteed securities, and securities of governmentagencies and supranational institutions. In reservesmanagement, special attention was paid to fulfill theliquidity requirements through maintenance of asufficient proportion of reserves in highly liquidshort-term instruments of both asset classes. All thetransactions with respect to reserves managementwere performed only through approvedcounterparties adhering to the limit structureapproved by the management and considering thesafety, liquidity and return on such assets.

Reserves management operations in its entirety werecarried out in accordance with the guidelinesapproved by the Monetary Board. The ForeignReserve Management Committee (FRMC), asrequired by the Foreign Exchange ReservesManagement Guidelines continuously supervised theoverall operations of foreign exchange reservemanagement and provided necessary guidance asappropriate during the year. Periodic performance ofreserve management was measured against the setbenchmark which reflects the risk tolerance levelsof the bank.

During the year 2007, particularly in the second half,the financial market turmoil sprung through the USsub-prime mortgage crisis resulted in a liquidity andcredit crunch. High oil prices fluctuating from US $

51 to US $ 99 (the benchmark West TexasIntermediary Brand) and world food prices soaringleading to picking up of global headline inflation,posed new challenges and questions to both policymakers and investors. This created a continuouslychallenging environment for reserve managementoperations.

The Bank’s reserves were substantially increasedtowards the latter part of 2007 mainly as a result ofreceiving the proceeds from the Sri Lanka’s debutinternational Bond issue amounting to US $ 500million. With continuous reviewing of the market andeconomic fundamentals in selected currencies/countries and keeping in line with the risk appetiteof the Bank, IOD made necessary changes to currencyand asset composition of the international reservesfrom time to time. Liquidity requirements of theBank, public debt repayments, risk managementparameters and income generating abilities were thekey issues considered in determining the asset andcurrency composition of the reserves portfolio.

The foreign exchange reserves of the Bank havegrown from US$ 2,323 million to US$ 2,881 millionduring this period. During the year, reservemanagement operations have generated a net foreignexchange income of US$ 125.3 million or Rs.13,861.9 million exceeding the income of theprevious year amounting to US$ 100.5 million. Theincrease in the income is the combined outcome ofboth increase in the level of reserves and interest rates.In order to augment the income IOD strengthenedits securities lending programs in 2007.

14.2 Risk Management

The risks associated with the foreign exchangereserves and their investments span into various risks,of which major categories include foreign exchangerisk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk andoperational risk. The risk exposure of the foreignexchange reserves and their investments aremonitored by the Middle Office of the IOD.

The risk of losing capital as a consequence offluctuations in exchange rates or the foreign exchangerisk is mainly managed through currencydiversification. By appropriate adjustments of theduration of the portfolio, the exposure of the Bank’sreserves portfolio to movements in the interest rateor the interest rate risk was managed. The credit riskis minimised using the standard criteria used by theBank to assess the credit risk of its counterparties.The liquidity risk which is the risk of incurring capitallosses in the event of forced liquidation is managedby establishing liquidity requirements.

17.6 Payment System Policy and Oversight

In line with the strategic plan of the Central Bank,during 2007 the Policy and Oversight Division ofthe PSD paid much attention on strengthening thepayment and settlement system oversight frameworkof the Central Bank by :

•strengthening further the operational robustnessof the LankaSettle System, the systemicallyimportant payment and settlement system (PSS);•promoting further the migration frompredominantly cash or paper based retailpayments to electronic payments;•encouraging banks as well as their customers touse relatively low risk payment means andsystems; and•pursuing the banks to pass the cost saving andefficiency benefits of PSS to the customers.

Having considered the possibility for an operationalfailure of a participant to create risks to theLankaSettle System, oversight activities weredirected to assess the preparedness of each participantfor continuing critical operations such as paymentand core banking in a disruption. During 2007, thePolicy and Oversight Division evaluated the businesscontinuity plans (BCPs) of LankaSettle participantsand directed them to improve their BCPs where

necessary. In September 2007, the Divisioncommenced on site inspections of disaster recovery(DR) sites of LankaSettle participants, with theassistance of the officers from the Bank SupervisionDepartment and the Information TechnologyDepartment of the Central Bank.

In view of ensuring proper functioning of the ChequeImaging and Truncation (CIT) System, the Policy andOversight Division advised and assisted LankaClearto issue a clear and comprehensive set of CIT SystemRules and an Operational Manual.

Having considered the public policy objective offacilitating the customers to receive cheque proceedswithin T+1 (where T is the day of receiving thecheques for clearing at LankaClear and 1 is thefollowing business day) under the Cheque Imagingand Truncation (CIT) System, the PSD was involvedin drafting and issuing a Direction to the participatingbanks of the CIT System in November 2007, to ensurethat banks credit proceeds of cleared cheques to theircustomers’ accounts on T+1.

Further the Policy and Oversight Division devotedmore time to facilitate the implementation of theaction points of the Road Map (2007-2010) which isaimed at fostering the development of the paymentand settlement infrastructure of the country.

To facilitate the implementation of the Road Mapthe Division performed the following functions in2007:

•extended fullest cooperation to establish theLanka Financial Services Bureau Ltd. (LFSB),a local SWIFT Service Bureau by banks toprovide a more economical and safe commonconnectivity point at the primary and disasterrecovery (DR) sites of LankaSettle participantsto communicate with SWIFTNet, thecommunication infrastructure of the LankaSettleSystem;•the need to regulate the fast changing money,payment, clearing and settlement serviceproviders and the lack of clarity in the Paymentand Settlement Systems Act No. 28 of 2005(PSSA) regarding the powers of the Central Bankin this area were brought to the attention of theMinister of Finance and Planning andaccordingly the H.E. the President issued theMoney, Payment, Clearing and SettlementService Providers Regulations No. 01 of 2007under the powers vested on the Minister by thePSSA. The regulations were published in theGovernment Gazette No. 1503/11 on June 27,2007; and

•In the exercise of the powers conferred to theCentral Bank by these regulations, the Policy andOversight Division has drafted a Direction onService Providers of Card Based PaymentInstruments to set out the minimum prudentialrequirements on all Service Providers in SriLanka to enhance the level of security of cardsand the systems in which the card basedtransactions are processed, cleared and settled.This Direction will be issued to the public in early2008.

Having considered the increased interest of SAARCmember countries to reform their national PSS andgrowing recognition of the benefits of a collectiveregional effort to foster PSS developments in theSAARC region, the PSD made arrangements to hostthe SAARCFINANCE Conference on RegionalPayments Initiative in July 2007. This conference isa milestone in the PSS development in the SAARCregion as the Governors of the SAARCFINANCEGroup approved the proposal of creating a SAARCPayments Initiative. In 2008 the Central Bank willtake the lead of forming the SAARC PaymentsInitiative by chairing the SAARC Payments Counciland establishing its Secretariat in the Central Bank.

18.POLICY REVIEW AND MONITORING

The Policy Review and Monitoring Department(PRMD) was established on 1st January 2007. Theobjectives of the Policy Review & MonitoringDepartment are twofold: to review and assess theimpact of policies implemented by the Bank with aview to improving their effectiveness; and to monitorand review the progress of the Strategic Plan of theCentral Bank with a view to ensuring itsimplementation within the time lines and inaccordance with the qualitative expectations of themanagement.

The Bank formulated a medium term Strategic Planfor 2007 – 2011. It identified the strategies whichthe Bank intends to follow in its key business areason the basis of strategic objectives. Goals have beenset with time frames and targets in each of the areasto enable the measurement of performance. Theprogress of the plan is monitored and reviewed bythe PRMD, particularly through periodic reports andmeetings with each Head of the department, whichare chaired by the Assistant Governor in charge ofPolicy Review and Monitoring. The progress is inturn reported to the Strategic Plan Review Committeecomprising the Corporate Management of the Bank,chaired by the Governor. In 2007 two rounds of suchmeetings were held. These meetings proved to be

effective in ensuring the implementation of the plan,particularly by identifying deviations and directingprogress towards the desired path.

The progress of the plan during its first year ofimplementation was reviewed at a retreat involvingthe senior management of the Bank in November2007. With appropriate modifications made, the planwas rolled over till 2012 and the new strategic plan2008 – 2012 was designed.

In terms of policy reviews, the department hascompleted the following policy papers:

(i) The Margin Deposit Requirement against LCsin respect of selected consumer products andmotor vehicles;(ii) Vault cash requirement of SRR;

(iii) Pre-feasibility study on the establishment of afutures market and commodity exchange foragricultural produce in Sri Lanka.

19.PREMISES DEPARTMENT

The Premises Department continued to carry out themaintenance and upkeep of the Bank’s Premisesduring the year 2007, in addition to providing supportservices such as transport and communicationfacilities to officers of the Bank.

Most of the maintenance work and a part of thetransport services have been outsourced with a viewto obtaining services more efficiently and at lowestcost.

While the construction of the Hostel Block was inprogress there was change in scope of work of thisconstruction as the Bank wanted to enhance thefacilities in all the 66 participant rooms, provide air-conditioning, hot water system, telephone system etc.to a 3 star rating level and it was re-named as“Sovereign Residences”. The project is expected tobe completed by end of March 2008, opening thepossibilities for training programs to be offered forthe first time at CBS along with residential facilities.

Due to the widening of the Anagarika DharmapalaMawatha a part of the regional office at Matara hadto be demolished and with the demolition it wasdecided to refurbish the entire regional office buildingat a cost of Rs.30 million. The construction workhas already started.

land of 134 perches obtained from the UrbanDevelopment Authority for a multi-storey car park.CBSL will get free parking facilities of 400 cars and10 buses and office space of 10,000 sq. ft. in lieu ofthe land.

The Department continued to maintain the LightHouse Clock Tower with a historic landmark valueadjacent to the Bank’s Head office.

20.PUBLIC DEBT DEPARTMENT

Public Debt Department (PDD) recorded significantachievements during 2007, in carrying out itsresponsibilities relating to issuing and managingpublic debt on behalf of the Government as its agent.Keeping in line with the strategic plan of the CentralBank, PDD formulated a medium term debtmanagement strategy in 2007. This debt managementstrategy contains the medium term strategies to (a)ease the long standing bunching of debt maturities,(b) lower the fragmentation in the bond market, (c)introduce benchmark bond series and develop abenchmark yield curve, (d) develop a credible andliquid debt market, (e) introduce diversified debtinstruments, (f) broaden the investor base, and (g)restructure the primary dealer system.

The maturity structure of outstanding domestic debtshows that there is a considerable bunching of debtmaturities towards the shorter end of the maturityprofile. In order to address this bunching problem, adebt consolidation programme has been designed anda test run to assess its effectivity was conductedduring the year. As in the previous year, PDD tookmeasures to address high fragmentation in the bondmarket as well. It continued the policy of reopeningthe existing Treasury bond series, while limiting theintroduction of the new bond series to the market.As a result, the total number of Treasury bond seriesreduced to 42 at end 2007 from 53 at end 2006.Recognizing the importance of strengthening thePrimary Dealer (PD) system, PDD took steps in 2007to restructure the PD system in order to diversify theiractivities.

Another landmark achievement during 2007 was thesuccessful launching of the first internationalsovereign bond issue. This was issued in a benchmarksize of US dollar 500 million with an 8.25 per centcoupon rate and a five year maturity. This debutinternational sovereign bond issue was an absolutesuccess and was oversubscribed by more than threetimes. With a view to lower the pressure on theinterest rates in the domestic market, and to broadenthe investor base of government securities market,the maximum limit of rupee denominated Treasurybonds available for foreigners was also increased to

10 per cent of the outstanding bond stock inNovember 2007 from the initially allowed maximumlimit of 5 per cent in 2006. The entry barriers forforeign investors such as minimum holding periodof one year, restrictions on maturity period and useof bonds for Repo transactions were also removed inearly part of 2007. Issuing of Sri Lanka NationBuilding Bonds, which was introduced in theprevious year for a period of one year, was terminatedin February 2007.

In order to reduce the transaction cost of participatingbanks and PDs, associated with the recording ofgovernment securities, PDD introduced a CBSL WideArea Network based application for the marketparticipants to record small value transactions. Thisenhanced safety of small investors in the governmentsecurities market by recording of all transactions inthe Central Depository System (CDS) maintained atthe CBSL. In line with this, the system rules of theLankaSecure system were also amended to impose apenalty to those who do not comply with thismandatory recording requirement.

With a view to expanding the investor base ofgovernment securities, PDD conducted a rigorousinvestor awareness programme coupled with anewspaper advertising campaign during the year. Inline with the awareness campaign, PDD took stepsto introduce retail outlets at regional level to tradegovernment securities to the retail customers incollaboration with the NSB Fund ManagementCompany Limited and the LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd.Thirteen such outlets were opened island-wide on 1st

August 2007. In 2007, PDD published its first annualpublication on public debt management with thepurpose of disseminating information to the generalpublic on the level and management of public debt.In addition, it would help to maintain a high level oftransparency in the public debt management process.To enhance the knowledge of policy makers,academics and players in the government securitiesmarket, a capacity building workshop was organizedby PDD in collaboration with the United NationsEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and thePacific (UN-ESCAP).

PDD also facilitated two missions; Fitch Ratings andStandard and Poor’s (S&P) on the country’s sovereignrating review during the first quarter of the year.

20.1 Developments in 2007

Borrowing Targets and Strategy

The gross borrowing limit approved by the parliamentfor 2007 under the Appropriation Act No.47 of 2006was Rs. 655 billion. It was estimated to raise Rs. 433

Part II

billion from domestic sources and Rs. 202 billionthrough foreign sources. Another Rs. 20 billion wasset aside for contingencies. During 2007, PDDmobilized a sum of Rs. 411 billion through domesticsources and Rs. 199.7 billion through foreign sourcesin terms of book value and maintained totalborrowings within the original borrowing target.However, due to the high yield rates that prevailedin the domestic market, in line with the rising inflationand tight monetary policy stance, PDD had to deviateto a certain extent from its initial domestic borrowingplan, relying more on short-term debt instruments,non-marketable instruments, foreign currencydenominated debt instruments and foreigninvestments on Treasury bonds. Thus, Rs. 23.3billion was raised as rupee loans and Rs. 37 billionwas raised as Treasury bills as against the originalborrowing targets of Rs. 10 billion and Rs. 5 billionrespectively. In addition, borrowings through SLDBsamounted to Rs. 23.6 billion in comparison to theoriginal target of Rs. 10.5 billion. In contrast, theborrowings through Treasury bonds were low, witha value of Rs. 302 billion as against the original targetof Rs. 356 billion (in book value terms). However,out of these Treasury bonds 61 per cent falls in tomaturities above 3 years, showing the appetite offoreign investors to invest in longer term bonds dueto attractive rates. Total foreign investment inTreasury bonds amounted to Rs. 49.7 billion, ofwhich 54 per cent was over 3 year maturity.

To ease the pressure on the domestic rupee market,more reliance was placed on foreign currencyborrowings during 2007. The project/programmeloans expected during the year amounted to Rs. 156billion. However, only Rs. 91.8 billion worth of loanshad been realized by the end of the year. In contrast,the commercial loans far exceeded the original targetof Rs.46 billion and stood at Rs.116.3 billion during2007. This included the international sovereign bondissue of Rs.56 billion, Treasury bonds issued toforeigners worth Rs.36.8 billion and a syndicated loanof Rs. 23 billion arranged through the Bank ofCeylon. In addition, Rs 35.7 billion was raised byissuing Sri Lanka Development Bonds (Rs. 23.6billion) and FCBU borrowings (Rs. 12.1 billion).

20.2 Issuance of Debt Instruments

In 2007, PDD conducted 52 Treasury bill auctionsand issued a sum of Rs. 817.2 billion (face valueterms) in gross terms. Reflecting the strong marketpreference towards the short term bills, 67 per centof the total gross issues were for maturities of lessthan or equal to 91 day Treasury bills. As a result, 54per cent of outstanding Treasury bills as at end 2007had remaining maturity of 3 months or lower. The

PDD was able to raise Rs. 401 billion (face valueterms) through Treasury bond programme byconducting 70 auctions as well as through privateplacements. This includes foreign investmentsamounting to Rs. 52.1 billion. In addition, Rs. 23billion of Rupee Loans were also issued.

Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) with amaturity of two years were issued throughcompetitive bidding process during the year. Theauction was oversubscribed by more than four timeswith bids amounting to US Dollar 215.25 million andthe bids received were accepted at a rate of six monthLIBOR plus a margin of 155.24 basis points.

In addition, a foreign commercial borrowing througha syndicated loan amounting to US Dollar 210 millionwith a tenure of 3 years was obtained at the rate ofthree month LIBOR plus a margin of 155 basis points.This loan was arranged by the Bank of Ceylon.

20.3 Debt Service Payments

In 2007, PDD serviced Rs. 482 billion of foreign anddomestic loans. This includes Rs. 176 billion ofinterest payments and Rs. 306 billion of amortizationpayments. Total debt service payment on the

20.4 Yield Rates and Secondary Market Performance

The rising trend in the yield rates of governmentsecurities, that was observed in the recent past,continued during 2007. High inflation, inflationaryexpectations and tight liquidity situation driven bytight monetary policies and the heavy governmentborrowing programme could be cited as majorcontributing factors to this increasing trend in theyield rates in the rupee market. Treasury bill yieldrates for 91, 182 and 364 day maturities increasedby 737, 720 and 697 bps, respectively, betweenJanuary to December 2007. The yield rates forTreasury bonds with maturities of 2-3yrs rose by 422bps during the same period. In line with the upwardmovement of the interest rate structure in the primarymarket, the yield curve of the secondary market toowas gradually shifted upward during the year.

In the secondary market, Treasury bill transactionshad markedly improved in 2007 showing the strongmarket preference that prevailed for short-termmaturities. Treasury bill transactions in the outrightmarket had increased by 66 per cent, while in therepo market, the Treasury bill transactions hadincreased by 102 per cent. Treasury bond outrighttransactions too had increased in the secondarymarket by 30 per cent mainly due to the higherparticipation of foreign investors. However, Treasurybond transactions in the repo market had declinedby 10 per cent as market participants use theirincreased Treasury bill holdings for repo transactions.

20.5 Scripless Securities Settlement System (SSSS) andthe Central Depository System (CDS)– LankaSecure

PDD continued the LankaSecure operations in 2007with its participants, including 23 LicensedCommercial Banks (LCBs), 8 non-bank primarydealers, Employees’ Provident Fund and CentralDepository Systems (Pvt.) Ltd of the Colombo StockExchange (the CDS Ltd.). In 2007, the total numberof transactions taken place through SSSS increasedby 60 per cent to 295,470 from 184,476 in 2006 whilethe value of transactions increased by 57 per cent toRs. 17,964,103 million. Total number of registeredinvestor accounts maintained at the CDS has alsoshown noticeable increase by 56 per cent to 41,953from 26,936 in 2006. These developments have takenplace mainly due to the aggressive awarenesscampaign, opening of new government securitiesretail outlets, introduction of CBSL Wide Area

Network based application to record small valuerepositioning transactions free of charge and severalother directions issued by PDD.

20.6 Primary Dealer Supervision

The supervision of Primary Dealer (PD) activitieswas continued through off-site surveillance and on-site examinations. In 2007, PDD carried out sixregular on-site examinations and continuouslyengaged in off-site surveillance activities byreviewing financial statements and monitoring PDperformance in primary and secondary markets.

21.REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

In 2007, the RDD continued its activities aimed atimproving the access to finance by the agriculture,small and medium and micro enterprise sectors byformulating and executing sustainable cost effectivecredit delivery and credit supplementationprogrammes. Negotiations were concluded in respectof a comprehensive new donor funded povertyalleviation scheme which will commence in 2008.Further, in the microfinance sector the PovertyAlleviation Microfinance Programme (PAMP)Revolving Fund Scheme, which was set up to utilizeloan recoveries of PAMP and came into operation in2007, was designed to maximize outreach andresources to beneficiaries. In 2007, RDD exploredthe possibility of establishing a Commodity Exchangeto facilitate price risk management and derive furtherbenefits for the agriculture sector. Further, consequentto the liberation of the Eastern Province, RDDparticipated in the committee appointed to design andimplement a three year development plan for theProvince. It also continued to advise the Governmenton regional development issues and in particular itsrecommendation for the introduction of aconcessionary credit scheme for agro and dairyprocessing activities was included in the Budget for2008. The Regional Offices of the Central Bankwhich operate several development programmesunder the RDD, continued to play a major role incoordinating credit delivery activities, promotingForward Sales Contracts (FSC) and disseminatinginformation in the regions.

During 2007, the RDD implemented/coordinated theundermentioned loan schemes in respect of whicheither refinance was provided or interest subsidy waspaid to Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs).

to derive other benefits for the agriculture sector. Aworking group consisting of persons with wideexperience in commodity markets was appointed towork towards this end. As an initial step, RDDcoordinated the feasibility study done on establishinga Commodity Exchange by two experts from theNational Commodity and Derivate Exchange(NCDEX) of India.

Small and Medium Enterprise Sector

During the year there was considerable demand forfunds made available under the Matale RegionalEconomic Advancement Project Revolving FundScheme, with the total allocation of Rs.77 mn for2007 being committed. Under the EIB Post TsunamiLine of Credit (Contract B Scheme), as at 30/11/2007,39 loan applications to the total value Rs.672.2 mnhad been approved and 18 loans to the total value ofRs 201.4 mn had been disbursed. The RDD was alsoinvolved in the negotiations with the ADB on theSmall and Medium Enterprise Regional DevelopmentProject, a new credit line to be made available toSMEs from 2008 onwards. Total funding for SMEsunder this project is to be US$ 88.89 mn of whichUS$ 50 mn will be contributed by the ADB. TheCentral Bank will be represented in the steeringcommittee to be established to manage this credit line.

Micro Finance Sector

RDD completed negotiations with the Japan Bankfor International Cooperation (JBIC) on a credit linefor a new poverty alleviation project to be known asPoverty Alleviation Microfinance Programme(PAMP) Phase II. The broad objectives of PAMP IIare alleviating poverty, mitigating regional inequalityand supporting peace. Accordingly, PAMP IIactivities will focus mainly on the conflict affectedareas and lagging regions, and be operational infourteen districts from 2008 onwards.

Meanwhile, after termination of the PovertyAlleviation Microfinance Programme (PAMPPhase I) at end 2006, the PAMP Revolving FundScheme came into operation in 2007. This schemewas designed to achieve broader geographic coveragethan PAMP Phase I and to maximize the allocationfor credit delivery out of available resources. UnderPAMP Revolving Fund priority has been given to themost vulnerable Divisional Secretariat identified bythe Government. With PAMP II also coming intooperation in 2008, activities of the PAMP RevolvingFund scheme are to be concentrated in all districtsother than those in which PAMP II scheme will beoperational. Accordingly, PAMP Revolving Fund andPAMP II together span the whole island. To further

Navodya Scheme seeks to achieve this to a certainextent. As at 30th September 2007, 4573 loans to atotal value of Rs.297 mn were disbursed under theKrushi Navodaya Scheme. Credit delivery under theTDP (Revolving Fund) and SPCDP (Revolving Fund)Schemes progressed beyond expectations during theyear with almost all funds under the SPCDP(Revolving Fund) being committed in the first halfof 2007. Refinance disbursed under the TDPRevolving Fund Scheme and the SPCDP RevolvingFund scheme were Rs.411.4 mn and Rs.540.2 mnrespectively. The percentage refinanced under boththese schemes is 87 per cent.

Following the sharp escalation of prices of milkproducts in the world market an urgent need arosefor substituting domestically produced liquid milkfor imported milk powder in order to avert thenegative consequences of high milk powder priceson the nutrition levels of the population and to saveforeign exchange. Recognizing the need for largescale processing capacity to achieve this objective,the RDD recommended to the government that aconcessionary loan scheme be put in place for thedairy industry. Further, RDD drew the attention ofthe government to the benefits that could accrue torural productivity and rural incomes, if concessionaryfinancing was extended to small and medium agroprocessing ventures which had financing needsexceeding the upper limit for loans under the KrushiNavodaya scheme. Accordingly, in line with theserecommendations a special credit scheme forenhancing rural productivity and rural incomes wasintroduced in the Budget for 2008. Under this schemeinterest subsidies would be paid to PFIs for loansextended for establishing dairy units in laggingregions and for small and medium scale crops andliquid milk processing development projects.

FSCs which were introduced to ensure a reasonableprice to farmers continued to be operational, withfunds being provided under the NCRCS scheme tobuyers of agricultural produce under the scheme.However, it had been observed for sometime thateven under FSCs, farmers are sometimes compelledto dispose of their produce at prices lower than theagreed prices due to buyers being unwilling to paythe agreed price when it was very much higher thanthe price prevailing in the open market. Similarly,farmers are reluctant to deliver goods as agreed whenthe market prices are higher than the contract price.RDD therefore recognized that a more robustmechanism for price risk management needs to beput in place, and decided to explore the possibilityof establishing a Commodity Exchange in Sri Lankato provide facilities for price risk management and

improve access to credit, the number of PFIs of thePAMP Revolving Fund scheme was increased to 14whereas in the original PAMP scheme, only 6Regional Development Banks participated.Meanwhile, the activities of the SFLCP RevolvingFund Scheme, progressed satisfactorily in 2007, withbeneficiary activities being managed by therespective beneficiary organizations, the People’sCompanies for Project Beneficiaries on whom themajor responsibilities of the management of thescheme were devolved.

Credit Supplementation Schemes

RDD continued to operate 12 credit supplementationschemes to mitigate the risk faced by banks whenextending loans to economically important, but riskysectors. As issuing of guarantee cover has nowterminated in most of the schemes, issuing of suchcover in 2007 was limited to the NCRCS, andSusahana Credit Guarantee schemes only. As at endDecember 2007, 56,579 loans granted under theNCRCS during the period 2003 to 2007 were underguarantee cover. Other activities related to operationof credit guarantee schemes such as collection ofannual premia, processing of claim applications,payment or rejection of claims and following up onpost claim recovery continued during the year. Thetotal premia income for the year was Rs.75 mn. Onthe request of the Ministry of Finance, the RDD alsoformulated a new credit guarantee scheme for theMicro Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Sectorwhich would become operational in 2008. The termsand conditions of this scheme have been designed toencourage project based lending rather than collateralbased lending by banks to MSMEs.

Regional Offices of the Central Bank

The RDD continued to oversee the developmentrelated activities of the Regional Offices (ROs) ofthe Central Bank in Anuradhapura, Matale andMatara, while the newly established Policy Reviewand Monitoring Department commenced monthlymonitoring of the progress of ROs. As in the past,the ROs were involved in promoting credit schemesoperated by the Central Bank and FSCs.Anuradhapura RO was able to promote large scalecultivation of Maize, by organizing farmers andarranging finance for them under the FSCs. All ROsconducted skill development programmes mostly inrelation to livelihood activities undertaken in theparticular regions, with the objective of imparting/upgrading skills and thereby increasing the incomeearning capacity of regional entrepreneurs. Inaddition to skill development programmes, the ROsin association with relevant departments in the

Central Bank conducted general awarenessprogrammes on Central Bank activities and otherimportant topics. These included programmes oninvesting in government securities aimed atpromoting regional investments in governmentsecurities. Other activities undertaken includedconducting educational programmes for students,facilitating currency management through acceptanceof damaged notes, collection of coins and creatingawareness on counterfeit currency etc, providinglogistical and other support to Central Bank activities,collection of regional data and dissemination ofinformation through the sale and free distribution ofCentral Bank publications etc.

22.SECRETARIAT

In 2007, the Secretariat Department facilitatedefficient functioning of the Bank through timelyprocurement of goods and services, continuousassessment and upgrading of systems and procedures,administering and implementing rules and regulationsin respect of leave, superannuation funds, local andforeign travel etc.

The department handled 57 tenders during the yearand procured capital goods and services and non-capital items amounting to Rs.73.7 million and Rs.54 million respectively by assuring and maintainingquality, timeliness and competitive prices. Thedepartment obtained a cost effective andcomprehensive insurance cover for all Bankproperties. Meanwhile, with a view to strengtheningand improving transparency of existing rules andregulations, action has been initiated to update theBank manual and it will be released in 2008. Duringthe year, an internal website on departmentalactivities was launched primarily to enhance theknowledge of bank administrative procedures amongemployees. The Central Bank Pension Scheme,Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Fund (W & OP) andWidowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Fund (WR & OP)were administered by the Secretariat Department. Atotal of 1,945 pensioners have been enrolled underthese schemes.

In 2007, the department has coordinated andorganized various religious and commemorativeevents and annual ceremonies such as Long ServiceAwards Ceremony and Independence Day Ceremony.

23.SECURITY SERVICES

The Security Services Department (SSD) continuedto strengthen the security measures in the CBSL toprotect its employees whilst performing duties,buildings and properties, visitors and the currencyconsignment in transit. Major actions taken in 2007

(LIII)

included preparations done in the Business ContinuityPlan for the critical operations of the CBSL,preparation of a specific contingency plan for SSD,conduct of seven fire drills, conduct of a number ofawareness programmes for the CBSL employees onhandling emergencies inclusive of fire fighting andfirst aid, periodical weapon training and live-firingtraining for security officers, and action to procurethe new security equipment (Walk-through MetalDetectors, Explosive Detectors, etc.) and to replaceexisting Baggage and Cargo Scanners. In addition,the security measures were further tightened with theassistance and cooperation of Government Securityforces.

24.STATISTICS AND FIELD SURVEYS

The Statistics Department continued its operationson collection, compilation, analysis anddissemination of data on national accounts, prices,wages, labour force and employment and other socio-economic sectors in 2007 as well. The majorachievements of the Department during the year werethe compilation of a prosperity index for Sri Lankaand its provinces and the conducting of inflationexpectation survey on a regular basis. In addition,the Department actively participated in the publicawareness programme of the CBSL as a source ofresource persons, for training programmes, seminarsand media discussions during the reference year.Many officers in both staff and non-staff gradesparticipated in both local and foreign trainingprogrammes, workshops and seminars to further theirknowledge and skills during the year, which enabledthem to improve the quality and productivity of theDepartment.

Statistical Surveys

In view of the importance of monitoring on a regularbasis, expectations of consumers, investors andbusiness community on future inflation in order toconduct monetary policy effectively, during 2007, thedepartment conducted on a monthly basis InflationExpectations Survey which was initiated in end 2006.The monthly survey covered a sample of around 300respondents and responses were collected throughdifferent means such as telephone interviews,interviewing at work places and e-mailing.

Results of the each month’s survey were submittedto the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and theMonetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC)at their monthly meetings in the following month.In addition, the department conducted a “survey onuser appetite for different denominations of currencynotes and coins and switching to the mode of payment

from currency to electronic methods of payments bygeneral public” at the request of the RiskManagement Committee of the CBSL. The objectiveof this survey was to find out the appetite of thegeneral public for different currency denominationsas well as to investigate in to their preferences andpractices in using alternative means of payments suchas credit cards, debit cards, telebanking etc. Thissurvey was limited to a randomly selected 16 GramaNiladhari Divisions chosen from the DivisionalSecretariat Divisions of suburban Colombo and hada sample of around 1250 respondents. Further, thedepartment revived the land price survey initiated in2006 and accordingly, from September 2007 onwardsdata on land prices were collected on a monthly basisfrom identified localities in suburban areas aroundColombo city based on the prices asked by vendorsof land advertised for sale in the weekly newspapers.Reports on the analysis of these prices were submittedto the Financial Systems Stability Committee onrequest.

National Income Accounts

Until end of 2006, both the CBSL and the Departmentof Census and Statistics (DCS) were engaged in thecompilation and dissemination of national incomeestimates. This led to a duplication of work andconfusion in the minds of the general public, whentwo government bodies released two different growthstatistics in the country. The international practicefollowed by many countries has been to compile thenational income statistics by the national statisticalbureau of the country. It is appropriate that Sri Lankatoo follow the same practice. Accordingly, theCentral Bank decided to use national incomeestimates compiled by the DCS from 2007 in itsanalysis of the performance of the economy, whilecontinuing only forecasting GDP for assessing futuregrowth performance and macroeconomicmanagement. Accordingly, the Department continuedwith the analysing of growth trends in CBSLpublications and provided growth projections whenrequired. This practice is consistent with that adaptedin the compilation of price indices and assessing andforecasting inflation. While the DCS compiles theactual price indices and inflation, the CBSL makesuse of them in assessing and forecasting movementsin inflation, for monetary policy purposes.

Country Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS)

The Country Wide Data Collection System, whichcommenced in 1978, was continued with regularcollection of information on retail prices of consumergoods, producer prices of agricultural commoditiesand wage rates pertaining to the informal sector.

(LIV)

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2007

Part II

Collection of data was accomplished through anisland-wide network of government school teachers,who were hired as statistical investigators for 103data collection centres operated in the island. Datacollected under the system is extensively used forcompilation of price indices, projections of the pricemovements for policy decisions, evaluation of theimpact of policy changes on prices and estimation ofnational expenditure and income. Data were alsouseful for analysing seasonal variations, volatility andregional differences in prices and wages. The sub-sectors covered for collection of wage informationunder the scheme included paddy, tea, rubber andcoconut cultivation, small-scale construction andservices. The accuracy of data collection was ensuredthrough regular field supervision of centres accordingto a pre-scheduled annual programme set at thebeginning of the year. As in the past, four regionalseminars were conducted in Colombo, Matara,Anuradhapura and Kandy in 2007 with a view toproviding further training for the data collectors toimprove the accuracy, quality, efficiency andtimeliness of their data collection. At theseprogrammes, special sessions were also conductedon contemporary developments in the economy inareas such as the Government Securities market. Theeffectiveness of such programmes was reflected inthe improved awareness and the enthusiasm shownby the teacher investigators.

Prices, Wages and Employment

Recognising the need for a more representativeconsumer price index and addressing major flaws inthe Colombo Consumers’ Price Index (CCPI), DCSconstructed a new price index called the NewColombo Consumers’ Price Index (termed CCPI(N))in November 2007. The compilation and the weightstructure of this index are based on the householdexpenditure of all urban households in the Colombodistrict as observed in the Household Income andExpenditure Survey conducted by DCS in 2002representing contemporaneous purchasing habits.The Department continued with the analysing ofmovements of consumer prices based on the indicescompiled by DCS and issuing a monthly press releaseon the same.

The Department compiled and analysed four regionalprice indices for the districts of Anuradhapura,Matale, Matara and Colombo, which measured theaggregate price movements at retail level in theseregions. The compilation of regional indices wasrationalized by replacing them by provincialconsumer price indices, with a view to meeting theneed of policy formulation at provincial level in the

context of provincial development. The Departmentcontinued to compile these provincial CPIs based onthe latest Consumer Finances and Socio EconomicSurvey (CFS) of 2003/04. The prices necessary forthe compilation of these indices were either collectedthrough the CWDCS or by outsourced investigatorswho had been trained and closely supervised by theDepartment. Meanwhile, the Department continuedwith compiling the Wholesale Price Index to analysemovements in producer or wholesale prices at theprimary market level.

During the year, the Department also developed acomposite CPI covering the entire country with alatest weight structure based on the CFS of 2003/04,capturing the most recent consumption patterns. Thisindex compiled monthly from the beginning of 2007,provided a more realistic picture of the movementof the price level at national level. The Departmentalso compiled an Informal Sector Wage Rate Index(ISWRI) for Sri Lanka, based on the CWDCS wagedata.

The Department continued to conduct Annual andQuarterly Public Sector Employment Surveys(QPSES), which were initiated by the Department in2001, with a view to complementing the quarterlynational income estimates and also for finding thelevels and trends of public sector employment in thecountry. The survey covered all Central Governmentand Public Sector institutions with over 1,000employees each as reported in the Annual PublicSector Employment Surveys (APSES) of 2006,excluding those under Provincial Councils. Theinformation collected in these surveys helps to assessthe effectiveness of the current employment policyof the government and as a measure of improvingproductivity and efficiency in the public sector.Information collected on labour force and labourmarket was also anlysed by the Department coveringthe areas of foreign employment, labour relations andlabour market reforms as well.

Dissemination of Statistics

During the year, the Statistics Department releasedits two annual publications titled “Sri Lank SocioEconomic Data 2007 – Volume XXX” and“Economic and Socio Statistics of Sri Lanka 2007 –Volume XXI”. The statistical tables in the pocketdiary 2008 of the Bank were also updated with newinformation.

The Department made its regular contributions tostatutory as well as several other Bank publicationsduring the year. The Monetary Board was keptinformed of the current developments with regard to

national income, inflation, prices, wages and thelabour market, as and when necessary. TheDepartment continued to routinely update itsDepartmental website on the local area network,StaNet, and to contribute to the Bank’s websitethroughout the year.

25.SUPERVISION OF NON-BANK FINANCIALINSTITUTIONS

The Department of Supervision of Non-BankFinancial Institutions (SNBFI Dept.) continued itsprimary function of regulation and supervision ofnon-bank financial institutions particularly,Registered Finance Companies (RFCs) andSpecialized Leasing Companies (SLCs) that areregistered under the Finance Companies Act, No. 78of 1988 (FCA) and the Finance Leasing Act, No. 56of 2000 (FLA), respectively.

During the year 2007, three companies that had beenregistered under the FLA were registered under theFCA increasing the total number of RFCs to 32 bythe end of the year. With the registration of four newcompanies under the FLA, the total number ofRegistered Finance Leasing Establishments (RFLEs)increased to 76 at the end of the year.

25.1 Registered Finance Companies (RFCs)

SNBFI Dept. carries out its regulatory andsupervisory functions through off-site surveillanceand on-site examinations. Off-site surveillance iscarried out on a monthly basis for all the companieswhile on-site examinations are conducted on a pre-planed schedule. The companies that are not subjectto on-site examinations during a particular year aresubject to spot examinations in which specific areasare selected and examined.

(a) Off-site Surveillance

Off-site surveillance of RFCs is carried out byanalyzing the information received throughperiodic returns submitted by the companies witha view of ascertaining the financial condition ofRFCs and their compliance with the Directionsissued and Rules made by the Monetary Boardunder the provisions of the FCA.

(b) On-site Examinations
