7.1Overview

he Central Bank further strengthenedits tight monetary policy stance in2007 to restrain the rising inflationarypressures. The conduct of monetary policy in 2007was a challenging task, as the demand pressure hadto be neutralised, while minimising its adverse impacton the growth momentum in the economy. The CentralBank announced its targets for monetary aggregatesat the beginning of the year and policy measures wereimplemented to achieve these targets. The policyinterest rates, viz; Repurchase and ReverseRepurchase rates, were raised further by 50 basispoints in early 2007. However, given the quantitativenature of the targets, the main strategy implementedto achieve them was conducting Open MarketOperations (OMOs) aggresively to siphon off liquidityfrom the banking system, while imposing certainrestrictions on the access to the reverse repurchasefacility of the Central Bank, thereby restricting directlythe credit creating capacity of banks. In addition, moralsuasion was used to discourage banks from excessivecredit creation, while continuing with the prudentialmeasures introduced in 2006 to safeguard banksagainst unhealthy credit expansion.

The monetary policy measures were successfulin maintaining reserve money well within thetargeted path during the year, and therebycontaining effectively the new money injection tothe economy. In fact, the Central Bank was able toachieve the most restrictive growth in reserve money(10.2 per cent) in the last five years despite therelatively higher real GDP growth and inflation in 2007.Both the short-term and long-term market interest ratesincreased, responding to the tight monetary policy andthereby discouraging further expansion in demand forcredit. As a result, broad money expansion alsodecelerated, but remained above the level envisagedin the monetary programme. The slowing down of the

growth in credit to the private sector during the yearindicated a clear sign of deceleration in broad moneywith its normal lag effect. However, it has been notedthat credit to the public sector has not declined asdesired. The full impact of the tight monetary policystance maintained by the Central Bank is expected toyeild the salutary results in 2008 and beyond.

Inflation arising from demand pressures wasnotably curtailed through tight monetary policy,though it remained high due to several otherfactors. The Central Bank’s demand managementpolicies helped to reduce inflation gradually during thefirst half of 2007. However, the substantial increase ininternational market prices of oil and certain othercommodities led to an upward adjustment in domesticprices of several goods and services. The pass-throughof increases in international prices, though it led to aone time increase in prices, will have a favourableimpact on containing future inflation by eliminating theneed for subsidising the same through theexpansionary borrowings of the government. Theremoval of subsidies also eliminated the suppressedinflation that was prevalent in the past, thereby helpingto reduce future inflationary pressures.

The Central Bank adopted several measuresduring 2007 to improve the monetary policydecision making process and ensure itstransparency. The Central Bank continued its effortsto improve awareness of the general public and marketparticipants on its monetary policy framework,monetary programme, monetary policy decisions andmonetary policy operations through continueddissemination of information. With the objective ofenhancing the policy predictability and transparencyby keeping the public informed in advance, the CentralBank announced the Road Map for Monetary andFinancial Sector Policies for 2007 and beyond on 2nd

January 2007. Also, releasing of regular and

occasional press releases and communiques andconducting island-wide seminars have strengthenedthe communication strategy, thereby ensuring greatertransparency of the Central Bank. A Monetary PolicyConsultative Committee (MPCC), made up of variousstakeholders drawn from the private sector andacademia, was set up to independently review theBank’s monetary policy actions and make suitablerecommendations for consideration by the Bank.7.2Monetary Policy

The Central Bank announced its monetarypolicy objectives, strategy and targets for 2007 inits Road Map for Monetary and Financial SectorPolicies for 2007 and beyond. In setting monetarytargets for 2007, in addition to the expected macroeconomic developments in 2007, the higher monetaryexpansion experienced in 2006 was also taken intoconsideration. Accordingly, a set of tighter monetarypolicy targets were fixed for the year, and strongmeasures were implemented to realise them.

The Bank continued its monetary policyoperations within the monetary targeting policyframework under an independently floatingexchange rate regime. In the monetary targetingframework, reserve money (high powered money) wasused as the operating target, while broad money (M2b)was used as the intermediate target. OMOs wereconducted aggressively, while imposing certain limitson access to the reverse repurchase facility of theCentral Bank to absorb liquidity and restrain creditexpansion. The Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR), wasmaintained at 10 per cent, while the Bank Rateremained at 15 per cent.

When compared to the annual reserve moneygrowth rates since 2002, the growth of 10.2 percent in 2007 was the most restrictive, despiterelatively higher GDP growth and inflation. In 2006,reserve money grew by 21.2 per cent compared tothe target of 15.0 per cent. Also, the average growthduring the period 2002 – 2006 was 16.4 per cent.Therefore, the achievement of a very low growth inreserve money in 2007 is encouraging, in the contextof the necessity for reducing the demand driveninflation in the economy. However, the favourable fullimpact of the deceleration in reserve money oninflation is expected to be realised with a time lag.

The Central Bank further tightened its monetarypolicy stance in 2007 to reduce high monetaryexpansion and the demand driven inflation. Thepolicy interest rates of the Central Bank, which wereraised by 300 basis points during the period 2004-2006, were further raised by 50 basis points in

February, 2007. Accordingly, the Repurchase andReverse Repurchase rates increased to 10.50 per centand 12.00 per cent, respectively. More emphasis wasplaced, however, on conducting OMOs aggressively,while imposing certain limits on the provision of thereverse repurchase facility by the Central Bank tomaintain reserve money within the targets. Accordingly,the reverse repurchase facility was provided only whenthe market had a overall liquidity shortfall. Banks wereadvised to resort to this facility only as a last resortand not to lend in the interbank market and build upexcess reserves against SRR, while borrowing fundsthrough the reverse repurchase facility. Further, thisfacility was made available only three times within acalendar month for any bank during the period fromJanuary to March, 2007. It was slightly enhanced tofour times per month from April to August before beingremoved completely at end August 2007, in order toease the pressure on market interest rates. However,towards the latter part of the year, the policy wasmodified again in order to discourage the excessiveusage of the reverse repurchase facility, whilecontaining the volatility of interest rates. Accordingly,in addition to commercial banks, the reverserepurchase facility was made available to primarydealers as well, who had been excluded from the facilitysince June 2006 to prevent the possibility of the CentralBank’s funds being used for building up securityportfolios and undertaking arbitrage operations. Theaccess of both commercial banks and primary dealersto the facility at the Reverse Repurchase rate waslimited to four times per month per institution. Theywere, however, allowed access beyond this limit at apenal interest rate of 19 per cent. Nevertheless, theCentral Bank continued to limit the funds extendedunder reverse repurchases on a particular day only tothe overall liquidity shortfall as estimated by the CentralBank. In addition to these measures, moral suasionwas also used to discourage undue credit expansion.

Responding to the tight monetary policymeasures, market interest rates moved upsignificantly, thereby making credit moreexpensive. The average weighted call money rateincreased by 185 basis points (the difference betweenDecember monthly averages) between the two yearsreflecting the impact of tight monetary policymeasures. Meanwhile, the average weighted depositrate (AWDR) and average weighted prime lending rate(AWPR) increased by 271 and 276 basis points,respectively. Also, the yield rate on 3-month Treasurybills increased by 854 basis points. These adjustmentshelped to reduce the demand for credit in the economy,facilitating the Bank to manage market liquidity at alevel consistent with the targeted reserve money path.

Accordingly, the Central Bank was able to operatewithin its quarterly targets for reserve money in 2007.Even though the credit growth to the private sectordeclined gradually as expected, consequent to theincrease in borrowings by the Ceylon PetroleumCorporation (CPC) to meet increased expenditure onoil imports as well as increased borrowings by thegovernment from commercial banks, broad moneyexpansion remained at a higher rate than anticipatedduring 2007.

Inflation remained relatively low during the firsthalf of 2007 due to the containment of demandpressures in the economy through tight monetarypolicy measures though it increased thereafterlargely due to external factors. According to the NewColombo Consumers’ Price Index, CCPI(N), inflation,which remained in the range of 13 -15 per cent on apoint-to-point basis during the first half of 2007,increased to 18.8 per cent by end 2007. The increasein inflation was largely due to the substantial increasein international prices of oil and several othercommodities, which led to upward adjustments inprices of many domestic goods and services duringthe second half of the year. Accordingly, the annualaverage inflation also increased from 10.0 per cent in2006 to 15.8 per cent in 2007.

The Central Bank took several measures toimprove the monetary policy decision-makingprocess during 2007 to make it transparent andenhance its effectiveness on achieving pricestability. As a measure of improving effectiveness ofmonetary policy further, key macroeconomic variablesthat have a bearing on monetary policy were identifiedand a comprehensive mechanism for monitoring theirgrowth path was introduced at the beginning of 2007.This mechanism helped the Bank to ascertain inadvance any slippages of policy variables and makerecommendations to the government for earlycorrective action. A Monetary Policy ConsultativeCommittee (MPCC), which comprises of variousstakeholders drawn from the private sector andacademia, was also established in 2007, in order toobtain their expertise to strengthen the monetary policydecision making process. The Monetary Board tookinto its careful consideration the views of MPCC whendeciding on the monetary policy stance of the Bank.

The communication policy of the Central Bankwas further improved to enhance awareness of thegeneral public on monetary policy decisions andthe outcome, through continued dissemination ofinformation. The Central Bank published its monetarypolicy targets and the basis of setting such targets, inthe Road Map at the beginning of the year. Themonetary policy stance of the Central Bank was

MONETARY POLICY, MONEY, CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES

The term “money printing” is normally used in a

broader sense to indicate the amount of money releasedby the Central Bank to the economy during a particular

period. However, the term has been rather loosely used

recently to convey different meanings, ranging from theamount of currency notes and coins printed/ issued to

changes in currency in circulation to the amount of creditgranted to the government by the Central Bank, etc. and

these misrepresentations have created continuousconfusion and misconception in the minds of the public.

Hence, this article outlines the composition of money

released by the Central Bank, the process and fundamentalsgoverning the release of money by the Central Bank and

actual amount of money released during recent years witha view to clear such misconceptions.

The money released by the Central Bank to theeconomy is termed “reserve”, “base” or “high-powered”

money, since commercial banks are able to create moremoney on the basis of reserve money, by generating credit

and deposits through a multiplier process. The CentralBank is the sole authority responsible for releasing reserve

money. Although the Central Bank maintains adequate

stocks of minted coins and printed currency notes in itsvaults to be issued as money, these stocks do not become

“money” until such time they are possessed by the publicas assets.

Reserve money consists of currency issued by theCentral Bank and deposits of commercial banks and

government agencies with the Central Bank. These areliabilities of the Central Bank and are shown on its Balance

Sheet. As per accounting fundamentals, these have to bebacked by the assets of the Central Bank Balance Sheet.

Accordingly, “issuing reserve money” or “printing money”

by the Central Bank is carried out on the basis of theacquisition of assets on fundamental grounds.

There are two main channels of releasing reserve

money from the Central Bank to the economy. These are:

(i) acquisition of Net Domestic Assets (NDA) and (ii)acquisition of Net Foreign Assets (NFA).

Box 16

The acquisition of domestic assets by the Central Bank

takes place through lending to the government and/orcommercial banks. As stipulated in the Monetary Law Act,

the Central Bank provides to the government provisional

advances amounting to 10 per cent of government’sestimated annual revenue. In addition, the Bank could also

provide credit to the government by purchasing governmentsecurities, mainly Treasury bills as a part of its monetary

policy operations to manage liquidity in the bankingsystem.

The government also maintains deposits with theCentral Bank. The difference between the borrowings

mentioned above and the deposits is called “net credit tothe government” (NCG) and it represents the net amount

of money released to the government. In the same manner,

money can be injected to the economy when credit isextended to commercial banks by the Central Bank as the

lender of last resort or to manage liquidity under its OpenMarket Operations (OMOs). The sum of NCG and credit

to commercial banks by the Central Bank, when set offagainst the other domestic assets and liabilities of the

Central Bank, is termed “net domestic assets” (NDA) of

the Central Bank.

The Central Bank acquires foreign assets through itstransactions with the government or operations in the

domestic foreign exchange market. As the Banker to the

government, the Central Bank purchases foreign currencyreceipts, mainly through foreign currency loans and grants

to the government, and releases an equivalent amount inrupees. Similarly, it sells foreign exchange to the

government to settle the government’s foreign loanrepayment and interest obligations. The Central Bank also

operates in the domestic foreign exchange market to dilute

undue fluctuations in the exchange rate by absorbingwhenever there is an excessive supply of foreign exchange

or by injecting when there is a large shortage of foreignexchange in the market. The purchases (absorptions) net

of sales (injections) of foreign exchange by the Central

Bank lead to a change in foreign assets, which is called

“net foreign assets” (NFA) of the Central Bank, and itcontributes to the change in reserve money.

The amount of money released to the economy duringa particular period, (normally a year) is determined by the

monetary policy targets of the Central Bank. At present,the Bank follows a monetary policy framework targeting

monetary aggregates. In this framework, the final target,

price stability, is to be achieved by influencing changes inbroad money supply, which is linked to reserve money

through a multiplier. Accordingly, reserve money servesas the operating target while the broad money serves as the

intermediate target of monetary policy.

Targets are set out in the monetary programme of the

Bank, which takes into account the expected developmentsin all the major sectors in the economy. The main purpose

of the monetary programme is to estimate the amount ofmoney that the Central Bank should inject to the economy

in that particular year. The money injection should be

sufficient to meet the expected expansion in economicactivities without causing any pressure on the economy

and markets. In other words, the growth in new moneyinjection or reserve money should tally with the nominal

growth in gross domestic product, i.e., it should be sufficientto finance expected expansion in output and the expected

rate of price changes.

The planned injection of money needs to be entirely

backed by the aforementioned increases in NDA and NFA(Table B 16.1). For any increase in NDA above the expected

level, there should be a corresponding decline in NFA, and

vice versa in order to maintain the planned amount of newmoney injection in a particular year.

For example, when the foreign exchange market is

highly liquid through increases in foreign currency inflows,

the Central Bank would need to purchase foreign currencyfrom the market to avoid undue fluctuations in the exchange

rate. This leads to an increase in NFA of the Central Bank.In the meantime, whenever the Central Bank purchases

foreign currency, an equivalent amount of rupees will beinjected to the economy and new money or in other words,

market liquidity, would correspondingly increase. If this

new money or liquidity injection is more than the desiredlevel, the Central Bank will conduct OMOs using

government securities from its holdings in order to absorbthe excess liquidity, (which is called sterilisation), and

thereby maintain reserve money at targeted levels. Hence,

there will be a corresponding adjustment in NDA, or more

precisely there will be a reduction in Treasury bill holdingsof the Central Bank, thereby lowering the NCG component.

Similarly, when the Central Bank provides provisional

advances to the government or transfers Central Bankprofits to the Treasury, new money is injected to the

economy. In such a situation, if market liquidity increases

above the desirable levels and hence becomes incompatiblewith the reserve money targets, this excess liquidity is

sterilised through OMOs. Therefore, the sterilisationprocess is used to absorb excess liquidity created through

both means, i.e., increases in NFA and NDA.

In the recent past, the annual percentage increases in

new money had been set at around 15 per cent per annumwhile the actual percentage increases from 2002 to 2007

are set out in Table B 16. 2.

As shown in Table B 16.2, the reserve money growth

rates were largely on par with expected economic growthand inflation, except in 2004 and 2006. For example, the

reserve money target for 2007 was set at the stringentgrowth rate of 11.6 per cent or, in value terms an increase

of Rs. 27.7 billion to Rs. 267.6 billion. However, the actual

amount of reserve money as at end December 2007 waseven below at Rs. 264.4 billion, resulting in an increase of

only Rs. 24.6 billion for the year. In fact, the actual reserve

money growth during 2007 was at 10.2 per cent, whichwas even lower than the tight target of 11.6 per cent set at

the beginning of the year. As seen in Table B 16.1, thegrowth in reserve money was entirely due to the expansion

in NFA. The Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bankdeclined by around Rs. 23 billion in 2007 leading to an

overall decline in NCG by around Rs. 12 billion.

Effective monetary management polices adopted during

2007 helped to maintain the reserve money growth wellwithin the targeted level enabling the Central Bank to

effectively neutralise the effects of excessive reserve money

expansion experienced in 2006. This has also led to adeceleration in broad money supply (M2b) from a higher

level of around 22 per cent in mid 2007 to 16.6 per cent byend of the year. A further deceleration of the growth in broad

money is expected in 2008. Accordingly, a moderation indemand-pull inflation is expected during 2008-2009 as the

deceleration in monetary aggregates would impact the final

target of inflation with a time lag.

reviewed on a monthly basis and the public was keptinformed of the decisions according to an advancerelease calendar. In addition, the Central Bankcontinued to make available information on keymacroeconomic developments to enable marketparticipants as well as the general public to arrive atinformed decisions.7.3Developments in Money and CreditAggregates

Money Market Liquidity

The Central Bank’s strategy for the year was tomaintain market liquidity at a level consistent withthe planned reserve money path. In this regard,market liquidity was closely monitored during the yearand several policy measures were taken to achievethe desired conditions. The management of liquiditywas a challenging task as there was a large injectionof liquidity to the system through inflows of foreigncurrency to the government and subsequent sales ofthose proceeds to the Central Bank. Nevertheless,monetary expansion was contained by absorbing theliquidity both on a daily and a permanent basis throughaggressive OMOs. Consequently, the total amountabsorbed through outright sales auctions as apermanent measure was nearly Rs. 111 billion.

Reserve Money

The tight monetary policy stance pursued bythe Central Bank was successful in containing thegrowth in reserve money within the targeted pathduring the year. As a result, reserve moneyexpansion, which was at 21.2 per cent in 2006, wasbrought down to 10.2 per cent in 2007. The resultingincrease in reserve money, or new money injected, in2007 was Rs. 24.6 billion compared with the increaseof Rs. 42 billion in 2006.

Viewed from the source side, the expansion inreserve money was entirely due to the increase inNet Foreign Assets (NFA) of the Central Bank,

which necessitated the Bank to implement policymeasures to reduce Net Domestic Assets (NDA)to maintain reserve money growth within thetargeted path during the year. NFA of the CentralBank increased by around Rs. 63 billion on account ofthe sale of foreign currency receipts of the governmentto the Central Bank. These consisted of the receiptsfrom the sovereign international bond issue,disbursements of foreign project loans and grants, asyndicated foreign currency loan raised from offshorebanking units (OBUs) of commercial banks, net issuesof Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) and sale ofTreasury bonds to non-residents. As a large amountof rupee liquidity was injected to the market by theCentral Bank through an increase in its NFA, the Bankwas able to reduce its holdings of domestic assets,particularly the holdings of Treasury bills by about Rs.23.5 billion. The provisional advances extended to thegovernment during the year amounted to Rs.11.7billion. Helped by an increase in net other liabilities ofthe Central Bank, the overall reduction in NDA wasaround Rs.38.5 billion.

The decline in Net Credit to the Government(NCG) from the Central Bank during 2007 largelysupported to reduce NDA and, hence, maintain thereserve money targets. NCG declined to Rs.101.1billion in 2007 from Rs.112.9 billion in 2006. The overallreduction was the net outcome of a decline in Treasurybill holdings by Rs.23.5 billion and an increase inprovisional advances by Rs.11.7 billion.

From the use side of reserve money, theexpansion was reflected in an increase in bothcurrency in circulation and deposits of commercialbanks with the Central Bank. Currency in circulationincreased by Rs. 16.2 billion during the yeardemonstrating the higher demand for currency by thepublic for transaction purposes on account of increasedeconomic activities and inflation. Deposits ofcommercial banks with the Central Bank also increasedby Rs. 8.4 billion in accordance with the increase inthe SRR as a result of the increased deposit liabilitiesof the public with commercial banks.

Narrow Money (M1)

Growth in the narrow money supply furtherupheld its declining trend in 2007, reflecting thetight monetary policy stance adopted by theCentral Bank since 2004. Narrow money, whichcomprises currency and demand deposits held by thepublic, continued its steady declining trend with thegrowth decelerating from a higher rate of 22.4 per centat end 2005 to 12.6 per cent in 2006 and further to 2.7per cent by end 2007.

increased by 9.0 per cent during the year, comparedto 18.4 per cent in 2006, while demand deposits heldby the public declined by 4.2 per cent as against the6.9 per cent increase recorded in 2006. This slowdownin growth is attributable to the shifting of the funds ofthe general public from non-interest bearinginstruments to interest yielding term deposits in theprevailing high interest rate regime. This alsoemphasises the efficacy of the tight monetary policystance pursued by the Central Bank.

Broad Money (M2b)

The tight monetary policy stance of the CentralBank was instrumental in reducing the expansionin broad money, although it remained above thetargeted level. The growth in broad money by end2007 was 16.6 per cent compared to the growth of17.8 per cent in 2006 although the target for the yearwas 14.8 per cent as per the monetary programme.The expansion in broad money during the year waslargely led by the increase in quasi money, whichconsists of time and savings deposits. Time andsavings deposits increased by 20.4 per cent duringthe year on account of the attractive higher interestrates offered for these deposits. Foreign currencydeposits also increased by 17.7 per cent on accountof the higher interest rates that prevailed internationallyduring a major part of 2006-2007.

From the asset perspective of the broad moneysupply, the expansion was led by the increases inboth NFA and NDA of the banking system. Theincrease in NFA was entirely due to the increase inNFA of the Central Bank following the purchase offoreign currency receipts of the government. NFA of

commercial banks, however, declined below end 2006levels resulting from foreign currency outflows onaccount of settlement of petroleum import bills; raisinga syndicated loan abroad by a commercial bank onbehalf of the government, which raised that bank’sforeign liabilities, while raising its domestic assets;utilisation of the foreign currency of commercial banksin extending syndicated loans to the government andinvestment in SLDBs.

NDA of the banking system, although increasedsubstantially during the first three quarters,particularly with the increased borrowings by thegovernment, recorded a deceleration in expansionduring the last quarter, benefiting from the settlementof a part of the banking sector liabilities of thegovernment. However, it is noted that all threecomponents of domestic credit, i.e., NCG, credit topublic corporations as well as credit to the privatesector, contributed to the increase in NDA.

reflected in the borrowings from commercial banks (Rs.28.7 billion), as net borrowings from the Central Bankdeclined (Rs. 11.9 billion) due to the decline in Treasurybill holdings. The higher borrowings from commercialbanks were reflected in the increased holdings ofgovernment securities and SLDBs by commercialbanks and credit granted in foreign currency by theOBUs of commercial banks.

Credit absorbed by the public corporationsincreased by Rs. 17.6 billion during the year incontrast to a reduction of Rs. 7.4 billion envisagedin the monetary programme. Credit to publiccorporations was largely dominated by credit utilisedby the CPC, which accounted for around 77 per centof the total outstanding credit of public corporations.During the year, credit granted to CPC increased byaround Rs. 22.5 billion, which was largely due to theincreased cost on oil imports which had been settledthrough bank credit. Meanwhile, the Ceylon ElectricityBoard (CEB) has been successful in gradually loweringits debt to the commercial banks by Rs. 3 billion in2007, though its liabilities to the CPC, government andprivate power producers remained high.

Growth in credit to the private sector declinedgradually in response to the tight monetary policystance pursued by the Central Bank. Credit to theprivate sector, which grew at higher rates in the range

of 24 -26 per cent at the beginning of the year, declinedsteadily during the second half reaching 19.3 per centby end December. The upward adjustment in thelending rates by commercial banks and limits onaccess to the Central Bank reverse repurchase facilityas well as moral suasion used by the Central Bank toreduce excessive lending by commercial banks wouldhave contributed to decelerate the growth in credit tothe private sector. Of the credit granted, over 86 percent was accounted for by the domestic banking unitsof commercial banks while the rest was provided bythe OBUs. The purpose-wise distribution of creditreveals that the highest share of credit has beenabsorbed for commercial purposes, which accountedfor 30.6 per cent, followed by consumption (20.6 percent) and housing purposes (16.6 per cent).

Financial Survey

The growth in broad money as measured by thefinancial survey (M4)1 was in a range of 15-20 percent during 2007. It increased from 16.0 per cent byend 2006 to around 20 per cent by August 2007.However, it decelerated to 16.7 per cent by end 2007

broadly in line with the deceleration in growth of theconsolidated broad money supply (M2b). Thecontribution of NDA and NFA of the banking systemand registered finance companies was about 79 percent and 21 per cent, respectively, to the growth inbroad money based on financial survey.

7.4Interest Rates

Interest rates in all the market segmentsincreased in 2007 responding to the tight monetarypolicy measures. The increase in policy interest rates,absorption of excess liquidity from the market on apermanent basis and restrictions on access to theReverse Repurchase facility of the Central Bank helpedmarket interest rates to adjust upwards. Somemoderation in market interest rates was observedimmediately after the debut international bond issuein October; however, that trend reversed to someextent towards the end of the year. The upwardadjustments in market interest rates helped to containthe excessive expansion in credit as expected. With

the increase in nominal interest rates, real interest ratesin many market segments also turned positive duringthe year.

Money Market Rates

The short-term money market rates were on anupward trend during 2007 amidst some volatility.The weighted average rate at the daily OMO auctionof the Central Bank increased during the year. Therepurchase auctions were held to absorb liquidity onan overnight basis on most days during the first half ofthe year except for a short period in March and April.Repurchase auctions were held during the last quarteras well. In addition to these daily absorptions, auctionswere also held for outright sales of Treasury bills toabsorb excess liquidity on a permanent basis duringthe first half and the last quarter. Interest rates at theoutright auctions for Treasury bills of short-termmaturities held by the Central Bank moved in line withincreases in yield rates on Treasury bills in the primarymarket.

Call money market rates moved in a wider rangeduring 2007 as the Central Bank maintained itsquantity targets on reserve money, while allowingthe market to determine the interest rates. The highvolatility was also fuelled by some imbalances in

liquidity positions among commercial banks. Theserates varied in the range of 12.36 - 42.25 per cent in2007. However, rates moved to such high levels onlyduring a few occasions and, on average, ratesremained within the range of 14-17 per cent. By endMarch, call rates increased to 42.25 per cent due tothe liquidity shortfall created through high demand forfunds during the festive season and the imbalance inliquidity among banks. With the improvement in marketliquidity, rates stabilised at around 14 per cent. Eventhough the call rates increased again during the thirdquarter as the Central Bank imposed restrictions onreverse repurchase transactions, rates declined withthe improved market liquidity through the receipt ofbond proceeds. The tax adjusted weighted averagecall money rate hovered closer to the upper bound ofthe interest rate corridor. The Sri Lanka Inter BankOffered Rate (SLIBOR), which is the average of offeredrates for inter-bank rupee transactions by 12commercial banks, also moved upwards followingmarket interest rates.

Deposit and Lending Rates

Both deposit and lending rates increasedresponding to tight monetary policy measures.Deposit rates increased by a considerable marginduring 2007 attracting more funds from the public, whilelending rates also increased substantially makingborrowings more costly. Meanwhile, both deposit andlending rates of long-term lending institutions other thancommercial banks also increased during 2007. Theinterest spread, as measured by the differencebetween average weighted prime lending rate (AWPR)2

and average weighted deposit rate (AWDR)3,increased by mid 2007 due to the higher increase inlending rates than the increase in the deposit rates.However, the spread narrowed down marginally withthe adjustments in deposit rates in line with theincrease in the lending rates.

AWPR increased during the year, but showedsome volatility following the other money marketrates, particularly call money market rates. As such,AWPR increased from 15.19 per cent at end 2006 to17.95 per cent at end 2007 with some fluctuationsduring the year. The Average Weighted Lending Rate(AWLR) that reflects the price of the entire loan portfolioof a commercial bank also increased from 16.56 percent to 18.08 per cent during the year. Lending ratesof long-term financial institutions also increased byaround 5 percentage points, during the year.Meanwhile, interest rates charged by commercialbanks on outstanding payments through credit cardswere in the range of 30-42 per cent compared to 21 -42 per cent in 2006.

A substantial upward adjustment was observedin deposit rates. AWDR increased by around 3percentage points to 10.31 per cent while the AverageWeighted Fixed Deposit Rate (AWFDR)4 increased byaround 4 percentage points to 15.49 per cent during2007. Interest rates on fixed deposits offered byfinancial institutions remained on par with the inflation,attracting more savers to those financial institutions.In line with the adjustments in deposit rates, the Legal

Rate and the Market Rate5 also increased. Accordingly,the rate applicable for the year 2008 is 9.16 per centin comparison to 6.86 per cent for 2007. A gradualadjustment to deposit rates was also witnessed in long-term financial institutions.

Interest rates on foreign currency denominateddeposits of commercial banks have increasedduring 2007 despite some downward adjustmentsin policy interest rates in some major economies.Interest rates on US dollar denominated savingsdeposits remained unchanged at 0.20-4.25 during2007 while US dollar denominated time deposit ratesincreased from 2.00-5.50 per cent in 2006 to 2.00-6.50per cent by end 2007.

Yield Rates on Government Securities

A substantial increase was witnessed in yieldrates on government securities with a preferencefor short-term securities reflecting high inflationexpectations in the short-term. Treasury bill ratesat the primary auctions increased continuously in 2007with market anticipating higher governmentborrowings, less attraction to Treasury bills due to thelimited secondary market operations and high inflationexpectations. Accordingly, primary market yield rateson 91-day, 182-day and 364-day Treasury billsincreased by 854, 721 and 700 basis points,respectively. Accordingly those rates at end 2007 were

21.30 per cent, 19.99 per cent and 19.96 per cent,respectively. However, interest rates on governmentsecurities started to moderate from the beginning of2008 with less government borrowings from thedomestic market and lower medium term inflationexpectations.

The higher increase in yield rates was seen inTreasury bonds but at a lower magnitude than inTreasury bills. There was a tendency towardsencouraging the government to rely more on privateplacements and alternative funding sources in orderto ease the pressure on the domestic debt market andinterest rates. Yield rates on Treasury bonds with 2-5year maturities increased in a range of 200-380 basispoints in comparison to the increase of 94-126 basispoints in 2006. The opening up of investments inTreasury bonds to non-residents also helped to easethe pressure on interest rates on Treasury bonds.

The secondary market yield curve ongovernment securities has shifted upward during2007 in line with increased yields on governmentsecurities in the primary market, yet continuing theinverted shape. During 2007, the secondary marketyield curve has shifted upward. However, the curve

showed an inverted shape, i.e. longer end wasdownward sloping as most of the higher yield rateswere seen in short-term maturities. This reflects thepreference of the market for short-term securities,indicating the expectation of high inflation in the short-term.

Yield Rates on Corporate Debt Securities

The high interest rate environment was alsoreflected in the corporate sector activities.Accordingly, yield rates on corporate debt securitiesincreased further in 2007. Interest rates pertaining tocommercial paper, a short-term debt instrument, whichwere in the range of 14.70 -16.95 per cent in 2006,increased to a range of 17.50-31.49 per cent by end2007. A number of public issues of debentures wereobserved during the year. These issues carried eitherfloating interest rates or fixed interest rates in the rangeof 13.50-17.50 per cent.

7.5Further Developments, Issues andOutlook

The introduction of a new consumer price index,CCPI(N), which is a more representative measureof overall developments in prices compared to theold CCPI, is considered a noteworthy development,in the context of the need for an accurate andreliable measure of inflation for effective monetarypolicy decision making. In addition to the CCPI(N),which measures the overall inflation, a core inflationindex, by removing items, prices of which are subjectto a regulatory review and hence not responsive tomonetary policy measures, has also been developedby the Census and Statistics Department. Accordingly,the new index would help the general public to betterunderstand the impact of monetary policy measureson core inflation. It would however be desirable to revisethe items included in the basket and their weights atleast once every five years to reflect changes inconsumers’ spending patterns. Given that the base yearof the CCPI(N) is 2002, such a revision is nowimmediately warranted.

A further step towards fulfilling the vitalrequirements for well informed monetary policydecision making was taken in 2007 by conductingmonthly inflation expectation surveys on anexperimental basis. These surveys have a widercoverage of economic agents including housewives andthe business community and they enable the CentralBank to track the potential future inflation given thestrong relationship between actual inflation andinflation expectations of economic agents. Furtherimprovements in the effectiveness of these surveys are

expected through enhancing the awareness of therespondents on the importance of expressing theirviews on future inflation more carefully and accurately.

Conducting monetary policy to maintain pricestability is a serious challenge when a substantialpart of the country’s inflation is driven by externalshocks. In 2007, the Central Bank started publishingits policy targets and strategies in its Road Map:Monetary and Financial Sector Policies. In this policystatement it was announced that the demandmanagement policies of the Central Bank for 2007would be based on a projected GDP growth of 7.5 percent and an inflation rate of 8.5 per cent. It alsoanticipated a decline in international prices of majornon-fuel consumer imports during the year. Eventhough the high international oil prices were identifiedas a major challenge at the beginning of the year, themagnitude of the shock was beyond the expectation.The actual inflation during 2007, based on the GDPdeflator was 14.0 per cent while it was 15.8 per cent asmeasured by the CCPI(N). It is worth evaluating thereasons for higher than expected inflation experiencedin 2007, given the fact that the announced monetarytargets were broadly achieved.

The inflation arising from demand pressures hasbeen notably curtailed through tight monetarypolicy measures, effective in containing theexpansion in monetary aggregates broadly in linewith the announced targets. However, several otherfactors, including a substantial increase in worldwideoil prices that led to substantial upward adjustments inprices of many domestically produced goods andservices, unprecedented increases in internationalprices of several food items and high inflationexpectations and wage pressures caused the overallinflation to be around 6 per cent higher than the initialprojections.

The average price of crude oil imported by theCPC reached US dollars 71.96 per barrel during2007, surpassing the initial projection, which wasbased on the projections of major internationalorganisations, by over 10 per cent. Also, the pricesof other commodities such as rice, wheat and milkproducts increased substantially in the internationalmarket during the year, against the initial assumptionof a decline.

External shocks will continue to exert pressureon the Central Bank in its efforts to achieve theannounced inflation projections in 2008 as well.As announced in Road Map 2008, the monetaryprogramme assumes an average oil price of US dollars85 per barrel and if it were to reach US dollars 90, theyear-end inflation may settle at a higher level than theprojected level. High oil prices, which reached aroundUS dollars 110 towards mid March 2008, as well asthe increased international prices of other essentialcommodities, if sustained, could lead to widen thecurrent account deficit exerting pressure on theexchange rate. Further, it could lead to higher domesticinflation, exceeding the initial projections, irrespectiveof the government’s policy to either adjust domesticprices in line with the international prices or subsidisedomestic prices. The pass-through of international priceincreases, though it leads to a one-time increase inprices, will have a favourable impact on containingfuture inflation by eliminating the need for subsidisingthe same, through expansionary borrowings by thegovernment. Therefore, continuation of the pass-through of price changes to the domestic market isessential for the benefit of the country and to containdemand. Similarly, concerted efforts of all thestakeholders on minimising oil consumption as well asconserving electricity is essential and the relevantministries and authorities need to engage in an effectiveawareness programme.

Increased financing needs of high budgetdeficits of the government is another challengefaced by the Central Bank. In 2007, the financingneeds of the government from domestic sourceswas maintained at a relatively lower level, therebysubstantially helping to successfully conduct monetarypolicy, when compared to the situation that wasexperienced in 2006. However, increased credit to thepublic corporations had a large impact on high monetaryexpansion. When the financing needs of the publicsector, i.e., government and public corporations arelarger than the originally planned levels, maintainingmonetary expansion in a predetermined path wouldnaturally be more challenging. Therefore, avoiding anydeviations from the expected plans of public sectorfinancing is essential for the successful conduct ofmonetary policy. Further, maintaining budget deficitsalong the announced path as planned in thegovernment’s medium term policy framework wouldhelp the Central Bank to manage future inflation andinflation expectations and maintain price stability.

demand for food products. Higher food prices are also

driven by Asia’s growing wealth and demand for meatand dairy products. It requires about two kilograms of feed

to produce one kilogram of chicken, and the ratio is 4:1

for pork and 7:1 for beef.

Higher international food prices put upward pressureon the cost of living, both directly and through their

potential impact on non-food prices. The pass-through of

international prices to domestic prices in different countriesvaries depending on several factors. If a country imports

a larger share of its food consumption, compared to itsdomestic production, the pass-though is usually high.

Domestic prices also depend on exchange rate policies,tariff structure and government subsidies. It also depends

on the margin between retail and wholesale prices as well

as transportation charges. For example, the retail pricesof many food items in advanced economies comprise a

larger component due to labour cost, whereas this marginis not significant for developing countries. Therefore, the

impact of a shock is felt more by developing countries.

For many developing countries, food accounts for a

significant share of total consumer expenditure. Forexample, the weight of food in the consumption basket is

57 per cent in Ethiopia, whereas it is 31 per cent in China,and only 10 per cent in the United Kingdom. In Sri Lanka,

according to the New Colombo Consumers’ Price Index,

food has a weight of 47 per cent. It is obvious that thelow-income countries are more vulnerable to the direct

first-round contribution of food inflation. Food pricescould also increase headline CPI indirectly by raising non-

food prices—for example, through a wage response tohigher food prices—especially in poorer countries in which

food accounts for a sizable share of total household

expenditure.

A significant fraction of current inflation in Sri Lankais driven by the one-off adjustments in price level due to

the increase in international food prices. The impact of

high food prices has obviously deteriorated the purchasing

In December 2007, the FAO Global Food Price Index

compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO)reached 184, the highest recorded monthly average since

the start of the compilation of the index in 1990, increasing

by over 40 per cent on a point-to-point basis. Internationalprices of all major food commodities, except sugar, rose

significantly in 2007. By January 2008, the index hasfurther increased sharply hitting 200 index points. Rising

prices of coarse grains and vegetable oils – the commoditygroups that feature most heavily in biofuel production –

account for the bulk of the increase. For example,

international wheat prices in January 2008 were 83 percent higher than a year earlier.

High food prices have been triggered by a host of

factors, including diminishing stocks and a continuing

strong demand for cereals for bio-fuel production.According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA),

the projected US wheat stocks for the end of 2007/2008crop year is the lowest in 60 years, in spite of increased

production, as the domestic as well as the import demandincreases sharply. As the US is the world’s biggest exporter

of wheat, this alone has a significant impact on prices.

The diversion of a significant quantity of cereals for

bio-fuels, is one of the major cause of falling reserve stocksthereby leading to the price surge. It is believed that the

increased use of some food items as a source of fuel is a

development that could substantially alter the structure of

power of an average person, but its impact on various

segments of the population is diverse. On one hand, highinflation reallocates the resources in the economy in favour

of the affluent and wealthier layers of the society. At thesame time, the relative increase in prices of food items

raises the income of agricultural sector employees, while

burdening the others. As a result, the impact of currenthigh food prices is mostly felt by the urban poor, who are

predominantly employed in manufacturing and servicessectors, while rural poor has some positive impact through

increased agricultural earnings. In spite of all the negativeimpacts of high inflation, it therefore has helped to reduce

regional disparities to some extent.

In response to high food prices, various countries have

formulated their own strategies to help the vulnerablepopulations to cope with the situation. Such measures

include plans to increase the production (Malaysia), import

duty waivers and reductions (Indonesia, Mongolia,Morocco, Turkey), export bans, taxes and restrictions

(India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Serbia, Ukraine, Zambia), directsubsidies and price controls (China, India, Russia,

Argentina, Morocco, Egypt, Mexico, Jordan, Zimbabwe,Benin, Senegal). The strategies followed by Sri Lanka are

allowing to pass the shock to domestic prices without direct

subsidies, plans to increase the agricultural production,

import tariff reductions and directed subsidies. Therefore,

Sri Lanka’s current inflation reflects the true impact of theexternal shock, unlike the inflation in many other countries

where the inflation is partially suppressed through directsubsidies and price controls.

The strategy to protect the domestic prices usingsubsidies and price controls is highly questionable. If

governments use inflationary financing to subsidiseselected food items, it would ultimately raise the overall

price level. If required resources are raised from the

non-bank sector, it may crowd out investments and affectfuture economic growth. Moreover, the largest beneficiaries

of subsidies are the high-income categories who consumemore, but not the poorest segments. Price controls may

create a food shortage within the country. Export bans willmaintain the domestic prices lower in the short-run, but it

will not encourage production, the way out to resolve the

root cause of the issue. On those grounds, the mostappropriate policy in a long-term perspective would be to

pass the shock to domestic prices, except for any directedsubsidies. However, this policy may lead to the politically

sensitive issue of a higher one-off increase in cost of living,which is desirable compared to continuing long-term

inflation.
