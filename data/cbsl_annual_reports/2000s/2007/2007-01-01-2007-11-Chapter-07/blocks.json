The conduct of monetary policy in 2007was a challenging task, as the demand pressure hadto be neutralised, while minimising its adverse impacton the growth momentum in the economy. The CentralBank announced its targets for monetary aggregatesat the beginning of the year and policy measures wereimplemented to achieve these targets. The policyinterest rates, viz; Repurchase and ReverseRepurchase rates, were raised further by 50 basispoints in early 2007. However, given the quantitativenature of the targets, the main strategy implementedto achieve them was conducting Open MarketOperations (OMOs) aggresively to siphon off liquidityfrom the banking system, while imposing certainrestrictions on the access to the reverse repurchasefacility of the Central Bank, thereby restricting directlythe credit creating capacity of banks. In addition, moralsuasion was used to discourage banks from excessivecredit creation, while continuing with the prudentialmeasures introduced in 2006 to safeguard banksagainst unhealthy credit expansion.",

    "text": "February, 2007. Accordingly, the Repurchase andReverse Repurchase rates increased to 10.50 per centand 12.00 per cent, respectively. More emphasis wasplaced, however, on conducting OMOs aggressively,while imposing certain limits on the provision of thereverse repurchase facility by the Central Bank tomaintain reserve money within the targets. Accordingly,the reverse repurchase facility was provided only whenthe market had a overall liquidity shortfall. Banks wereadvised to resort to this facility only as a last resortand not to lend in the interbank market and build upexcess reserves against SRR, while borrowing fundsthrough the reverse repurchase facility. Further, thisfacility was made available only three times within acalendar month for any bank during the period fromJanuary to March, 2007. It was slightly enhanced tofour times per month from April to August before beingremoved completely at end August 2007, in order toease the pressure on market interest rates. However,towards the latter part of the year, the policy wasmodified again in order to discourage the excessiveusage of the reverse repurchase facility, whilecontaining the volatility of interest rates. Accordingly,in addition to commercial banks, the reverserepurchase facility was made available to primarydealers as well, who had been excluded from the facilitysince June 2006 to prevent the possibility of the CentralBank\u2019s funds being used for building up securityportfolios and undertaking arbitrage operations. Theaccess of both commercial banks and primary dealersto the facility at the Reverse Repurchase rate waslimited to four times per month per institution. Theywere, however, allowed access beyond this limit at apenal interest rate of 19 per cent.

It alsoanticipated a decline in international prices of majornon-fuel consumer imports during the year.

High oil prices, which reached aroundUS dollars 110 towards mid March 2008, as well asthe increased international prices of other essentialcommodities, if sustained, could lead to widen thecurrent account deficit exerting pressure on theexchange rate. Further, it could lead to higher domesticinflation, exceeding the initial projections, irrespectiveof the government\u2019s policy to either adjust domesticprices in line with the international prices or subsidisedomestic prices. The pass-through of international priceincreases, though it leads to a one-time increase inprices, will have a favourable impact on containingfuture inflation by eliminating the need for subsidisingthe same, through expansionary borrowings by thegovernment. Therefore, continuation of the pass-through of price changes to the domestic market isessential for the benefit of the country and to containdemand.
