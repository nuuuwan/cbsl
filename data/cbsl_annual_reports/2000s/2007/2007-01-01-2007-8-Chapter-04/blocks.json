    "text": "he overall developments in pricescontinued to be unfavourable during2007, despite the tight monetary policymeasures to curtail demand pressure, due to bothdomestic and external factors. As measured by theNew Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI(N)), thegeneral price level moved on an upward trend, leadingto an annual average increase of 15.8 per cent in 2007compared with an increase of 10 per cent in 2006. Thisadverse development was a combined effect of severalfactors both of domestic and external origin. On thedomestic front, the terrorist disturbances in major paddyproducing areas in the North and East, bad weatherconditions and higher demand for rice due to thesubstitution effect arising from higher wheat prices hadan adverse impact on domestic rice prices. The supplyshortages and high distribution cost also raised theprices of domestic agricultural commodities. On theexternal front, the continued escalation of global oil andgas prices led to upward adjustments in domestic pricesof these items at several occasions during the year,exerting direct and indirect impact on the prices ofconsumer items at varying intensities. Equally, theadverse developments in the international commoditymarket coupled with both global supply shortages andincreased demand, raised the prices of major importedfood commodities such as wheat and milk foods,particularly towards the second half of the year. Thereal wage increases during the year also exerted somepressure on prices. These external developments andsupply shocks had an overriding impact on prices,though the demand pressure was notably curtailed byimplementing a tight monetary policy programme.",

    "text": "Price increases of most domestic agriculturecommodities were sharper in 2007 compared to2006. The price of rice was on an escalation path sinceMay, 2007 in response to the set-back in paddy pro-duction which dropped by 6.3 per cent in 2007. In ad-dition, increased demand for rice resulting from the sub-stitution effect of high bread and wheat flour prices,especially during the latter part of the year, too had animpact on sustaining the high price levels. As a result,retail prices of rice rose in a range of 18-35 per centduring 2007. The average price increases of vegeta-bles during the year was also significant on account oflow supply from main producing areas, aggravated bybad weather conditions, resulting in earth slips in upcountry areas and floods in the down south. There wasan improvement in the coconut output in 2007 as com-pared with the last year. However, the increase in im-port duty on other edible oils during the year had ademand pressure on coconut oil, diverting more out-put for oil production. This resulted in a decrease inthe number of nuts available for domestic consump-tion leading to higher coconut prices in the domesticmarket in 2007. Meanwhile, higher export prices helpedto increase the wages of workers in the coconut indus-try in 2007. Consequently, the prices of coconut andcoconut oil recorded increases of 21 per cent and 53per cent, respectively. Similarly, the production of freshfish recorded a growth of 15.8 per cent in 2007 withthe full recovery of the fisheries sector aftermath of thetsunami devastation, but the increased fuel prices hadan upward pressure on the prices.",

Amongother key food commodities, the increases in the im-port price of dhal (68 per cent) and dried chillies (31per cent) were also significant. However, in contrast,average import price of sugar declined by 24 per centin US dollar terms during the year with the increasedglobal supply, especially from India and Brazil.

Similarly,the high international price of LP gas which rose to apeak of 1.2 US dollars per kg by December, 2007 com-pared to a price of 0.62 US dollars at the beginning ofthe year, led to raise the domestic prices at severaloccasions during the year.

    "text": "The male contribution to foreign employmenthad been persistently increasing over the years.The share of male workers had further risen to 47 percent in 2007 from that of 44 per cent in 2006. Thisincrease was due to high demand for skilled andunskilled jobs for males in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAEand Jordan, particularly in construction andmanufacturing sectors. On the other hand, the totaldepartures for Saudi Arabia and Oman, suffered a set-back, mainly due to inadequate remuneration forcertain categories of employment, includinghousemaids. The growth in departures of females,particularly housemaids had been slow over the recentyears, mainly due to availability of job opportunities inSri Lanka.",

However, this dominancehas become weaker over the years, with the share ofhousemaids in foreign employment falling further from49 per cent in 2006 to 47 per cent in 2007. At the sametime, Sri Lanka has begun to explore the opportunitiesin various other areas of employment in the recent past.An apprenticeship training programme in theconstruction sector leading to an internationallyaccepted certification and similar training in hospitalitytrade were undertaken with a view to cater to thesesectors in the global market. Consequently, the migrantworkforce in the categories of skilled and unskilledlabour, other than the housemaids, increased from 42per cent in 2006 to 47 per cent in 2007.",

In particular, farmers whodo not have holding capacity often have to dispose oftheir harvest at depressed prices that prevail during theharvest season. Forward Sales Contracts(FSC) inagricultural commodities were introduced by the CentralBank in 1999, as a solution to a chronic problem of widelyfluctuating prices of agricultural commodities betweenthe seasons and off seasons. In an FSC, a producer andbuyer agree to purchase or sell, respectively a specifiedquantity of a commodity on a predetermined futuredate at a predetermined price. In such a contract, termslike quantity, quality, delivery date, and price are agreedupon between the buyer and seller, making each contractunique.",

In the circumstances, anyforward contract he enters into may not be honoured andhe may be forced to agree to a compromise price. If aCommodity Exchange exists, it is possible for the farmer tosell March paddy futures at the price prevailing in theExchange in December(say Rs. 20,000 per mt) . If paddyprices drop sharply in the physical market, the price inthe futures market would also drop as prices in the twomarkets move in tandem with each other. Therefore, thefarmer is in a position to make a profit by squaring hisposition in the futures market, as he could buy March paddyfutures at a low price (say Rs. 17, 000 per mt).

Exporters often needto contract in advance and, as such, are exposed to risk, ifprices of supplies to be exported go up in the physicalmarket at the time of the execution of the contract. Ifthis risk is to be avoided by purchasing supplies inadvance, capital would be tied up and a storage cost hasto be incurred. These costs will have to be factored intothe prices quoted by the exporter. By substituting a futuresmarket transaction(future purchase) for a physical markettransaction, price risk could be mitigated and a morecompetitive price could be quoted to the overseas buyer.(It should be noted that to take a position in the futuresmarket, a hedger needs to put up only a small margin ofthe value of the contract and, therefore only a smallsegment capital will be tied up). Further, it has beenfound that the quality of commodities in the physicalmarket improves over time if trading in contracts of suchcommodities take place in the Commodity Exchange.This is because trading of contracts of standardizedquality of the underlying commodity takes place in aCommodity Exchange creating greater awareness onquality standards among stakeholders. Further, for moreefficient price hedging it is necessary for the quality ofcommodities traded in the physical market to bebenchmarked against the standardized quality ofcommodities in contracts traded at the CommodityExchange. Such a situation will inevitably raise thedemand for commodities with quality corresponding tothe standardized quality/qualities in contracts traded inthe Commodity Exchange, bringing about an all roundimprovement in quality of commodities.",
