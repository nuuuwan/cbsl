4.1Overview

he overall developments in pricescontinued to be unfavourable during2007, despite the tight monetary policymeasures to curtail demand pressure, due to bothdomestic and external factors. As measured by theNew Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI(N)), thegeneral price level moved on an upward trend, leadingto an annual average increase of 15.8 per cent in 2007compared with an increase of 10 per cent in 2006. Thisadverse development was a combined effect of severalfactors both of domestic and external origin. On thedomestic front, the terrorist disturbances in major paddyproducing areas in the North and East, bad weatherconditions and higher demand for rice due to thesubstitution effect arising from higher wheat prices hadan adverse impact on domestic rice prices. The supplyshortages and high distribution cost also raised theprices of domestic agricultural commodities. On theexternal front, the continued escalation of global oil andgas prices led to upward adjustments in domestic pricesof these items at several occasions during the year,exerting direct and indirect impact on the prices ofconsumer items at varying intensities. Equally, theadverse developments in the international commoditymarket coupled with both global supply shortages andincreased demand, raised the prices of major importedfood commodities such as wheat and milk foods,particularly towards the second half of the year. Thereal wage increases during the year also exerted somepressure on prices. These external developments andsupply shocks had an overriding impact on prices,though the demand pressure was notably curtailed byimplementing a tight monetary policy programme.

The nominal wages of all three sectors, namelypublic sector, formal private sector and informalsector increased in 2007. Real wage increases ofpublic sector employees recorded a decelerating trend,while that of formal private sector recorded an increasein 2007, as against the real wage losses in 2006. The

PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

increase in wages of the public sector employees wasdue to the payment of remaining 50 per cent of thesalary revisions of last year and the upward adjustmentof the cost of living allowance (COLA). The upwardrevision in the minimum wage for all workers earning amonthly salary, governed by the Wages Board Tradeshad a significant impact on the wage rate indices ofthe formal private sector. However, informal sectoremployees suffered real wage losses, as their wagesdid not increase sufficiently to compensate the increasein the price level.

The rate of unemployment continued itsdeclining trend observed over the past few yearsand dropped to its lowest annual rate of 6 per centin 2007, while the quarterly unemployment alsorecorded its lowest ever level of 5.5 per cent duringfourth quarter of 2007. Increased employmentopportunities were seen in the personal services,construction, transport, storage and communicationsectors during the year. However, the set-back inagriculture production, particularly paddy, resulted in adrop in agricultural employment. Meanwhile, theinfrastructure development projects created moreemployment opportunities, especially for youth,contributing to reduce unemployment. Meanwhile,improvement in labour productivity witnessed over theyears, especially in the industry and services sectorscontributed to achieve high economic growth. At thesame time, the improvement in the overseas jobmarket, which accounts for around 18 per cent of thetotal employed, was significant in reducingunemployment in 2007.

4.2Prices

Factors Contributing to Price Movements

The general price level increased in 2007 over2006 consequential upon the build up of pricepressure due to combined effects of domestic aswell as external demand and supply factors. Thiswas reflected by the annual average change of the

CCPI(N), which registered a 15.8 per cent increase.The increase in wages of public sector employees inJanuary, 2007 following the budget proposalspresented in November 2006, exerted some pressureon consumer prices through increased demand.However, the tight monetary policy stance adopted bythe Central Bank by keeping the reserve money wellwithin the stringent targets in 2007 curtailed the demandpressure during the year.

Supply deficiencies in both the local andinternational markets resulted in higher prices offood commodities in 2007. This was exacerbated bythe disturbances created for distribution of goods dueto adverse security developments in the Northern andEastern provinces and high cost of transportationarising from the escalation of fuel prices. In addition,prices of food imports rose sharply due to the highglobal agricultural prices, driven by the increaseddemand generated from high growth in Asianeconomies and lower supply that resulted from adverseweather conditions. However, the government'sprogramme to stabilize the prices of ten essential foodcommodities from time to time during the yearcontributed to lower the pressure on food prices tosome extent.

Price increases of most domestic agriculturecommodities were sharper in 2007 compared to2006. The price of rice was on an escalation path sinceMay, 2007 in response to the set-back in paddy pro-duction which dropped by 6.3 per cent in 2007. In ad-dition, increased demand for rice resulting from the sub-stitution effect of high bread and wheat flour prices,especially during the latter part of the year, too had animpact on sustaining the high price levels. As a result,retail prices of rice rose in a range of 18-35 per centduring 2007. The average price increases of vegeta-bles during the year was also significant on account oflow supply from main producing areas, aggravated bybad weather conditions, resulting in earth slips in upcountry areas and floods in the down south. There wasan improvement in the coconut output in 2007 as com-pared with the last year. However, the increase in im-port duty on other edible oils during the year had ademand pressure on coconut oil, diverting more out-put for oil production. This resulted in a decrease inthe number of nuts available for domestic consump-tion leading to higher coconut prices in the domesticmarket in 2007. Meanwhile, higher export prices helpedto increase the wages of workers in the coconut indus-try in 2007. Consequently, the prices of coconut andcoconut oil recorded increases of 21 per cent and 53per cent, respectively. Similarly, the production of freshfish recorded a growth of 15.8 per cent in 2007 withthe full recovery of the fisheries sector aftermath of thetsunami devastation, but the increased fuel prices hadan upward pressure on the prices.

Prices of major import commodities increasedsubstantially, as a result of high international prices.World market prices of wheat grain and milk powderrose during the year as a result of low supply mainlydue to the drought and dry weather conditions in Aus-tralia. The import price of milk powder, in US dollarterms, rose by around 20 per cent, while that of wheatgrain rose by 47 per cent, on average, in 2007. Amongother key food commodities, the increases in the im-port price of dhal (68 per cent) and dried chillies (31per cent) were also significant. However, in contrast,average import price of sugar declined by 24 per centin US dollar terms during the year with the increasedglobal supply, especially from India and Brazil. Reflect-ing this, the domestic consumer prices also registeredan annual average price decline of 8 per cent in 2007over 2006.

The upsurge in crude oil prices was a major driv-ing force in raising the overall cost structure in2007. The average price of crude oil imported in 2007rose by around 10 per cent from US dollars 64 perbarrel in 2006 to US dollars 71 per barrel compellingthe upward revision of domestic fuel prices. Similarly,the high international price of LP gas which rose to apeak of 1.2 US dollars per kg by December, 2007 com-pared to a price of 0.62 US dollars at the beginning ofthe year, led to raise the domestic prices at severaloccasions during the year. As a result, domestic priceof LP gas increased by an average of 35 per cent. Im-port price of fertilizer too increased by 18 per cent dur-ing 2007 compared to a 3 per cent increase in 2006. Inaddition to higher international prices, price increases

of imported goods were affected by the increasedfreight charges in response to high fuel prices.

The Sri Lanka Rupee depreciated by 6.0 per centon average against the US dollar in 2007 over 2006,but on year-on-year basis depreciation was lessthan 1.0 per cent, due to the sharp appreciation ofthe currency during the latter part of the year. Theimpact of currency depreciation was reflected by thehigher increase in import prices in terms of Sri Lankanrupee than that, in US dollar terms. However, the im-pact of increased import prices of key essential fooditems on consumers was mitigated to some extent byremoving or lowering customs duty.

Several administrative price revisions took placeduring 2007. This had both direct and indirect impacton rising price levels of domestically produced as wellas imported goods. The adjustments to fuel pricesresulted in petrol, diesel and kerosene prices rising by20 per cent, 18 per cent and 43 per cent, respectivelyduring the year. Consequent upon these revisions,transport charges were increased, including a 16.5 percent increase in bus fares. The electricity charges ofboth domestic and industrial users were also revisedupward during the year. Although these price revisionshad a cascading effect through increased transport

expenditure and input costs, in the long run, the removalof subsidies is beneficial to contain inflation throughreduced pressure on budget deficit.

Consumer prices showed volatility due toseasonal factors and natural disasters. Agriculturalprices showed more volatility than industrial pricesresponding to the two main agricultural seasons of Yalaand Maha along with the natural vagaries viz., floods,droughts and pests. In addition, prices creeped up dueto the increased demand generated from the two mainfestive seasons in April and December.

Movement of Price Indices

New Colombo Consumers' Price Index - CCPI(N)

The consumer price behaviour during the year2007 was analysed on the newly introducedCCPI(N). The CCPI(N) was introduced to measuregeneral movements of consumer prices. The indexconstructed by the DCS on the basis of theconsumption patterns revealed in the HouseholdIncome and Expenditure Survey of 2002 was acceptedas the official measure of inflation in Sri Lanka inNovember 2007, replacing the outdated ColomboConsumers' Price Index (CCPI)1.

A reliable, accurate and timely available measure ofinflation is needed to assess inflationary pressure in acountry and for policy formulation to achieve pricestability, the key objective of monetary policy. In manycountries, a consumer price index (CPI) is used for thispurpose. A CPI measures the cost of a basket of goodsand services consumed by a representative group ofconsumers and thereby indicates the average level ofprices of items in the basket. In Sri Lanka, the widelyused index for this purpose for more than 5 decades wasthe Colombo Consumers’ Price Index (CCPI), computedby the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS).

CCPI had been used as the official CPI of Sri Lanka,since 1953. Though it served as a representative priceindex at the time it was introduced with many structuralchanges that had occurred since then, its applicabilityhas been of little relevance today. It suffers from manyinherent weaknesses, mainly stemming from its more thanfive and a half decade old base. The soundness of a CPIdepends on the extent to which it had captured the currentconsumption behaviour of an average household in thereference population. The items to be chosen forcomputing a CPI as well as the relative weights assignedto them need be based on findings of a contemporaneoussurvey on consumption patterns of the targeted group.The relative importance of each item consumed by theconsumer is represented by the weight assigned to each

Box 10

item in the index, derived normally through periodicallyconducted household expenditure surveys. CCPI, theoldest index in Sri Lanka, was based on the monthlyspending patterns of 455 working class households, thatlived in the Colombo Municipal area in 1949/50.Accordingly, CCPI is indisputably outdated.

According to the latest Household Income andExpenditure Survey (HIES) conducted by DCS in 2002,the household consumption patterns have undergonesubstantial changes during the last 50 years, with theimprovement in income levels and also the changes intastes and consumer preferences over time with theavailability of new goods and services. These changeshave substantially altered the size, content andcomposition of the basket of goods and services, the pricemovement of which is measured by CCPI. CCPI basketdoes not contain some of the current main expenditureitems such as LP gas, water, telephone, private tuitionand some popular items like mosquito coils. Food itemsare notably over-represented in the CCPI basket becausein 1949/50 food constituted the major item in consumerbudgets. Although some revisions have been made to theindex from time to time, those changes have been ad hocand limited in scope. The index is highly sensitive to pricechanges of several items, the significance of which hasdeclined substantially as better substitutes have emergedover the years. Unlike in many other countries,

reweighting and rebasing were not done to CCPI for manyyears, which made the index outdated and non-representative of the goods and services consumed by thepeople.

Hence, the need for a more representative consumerprice index had been repeatedly highlighted by many fordecades. In view of this long felt need, DCS constructed amore comprehensive CPI called the New ColomboConsumers’ Price Index, abbreviated as CCPI(N), in

November, 2007 addressing many of the deficiencies ofthe old index. It is based on the most recent consumerexpenditure pattern as reflected by the HIES of 2002conducted by DCS and it has a wider representation thanCCPI in scope and geographical coverage. The salientfeatures of CCPI(N) vis-a-vis CCPI are highlighted in TableB 10.1, while comparable weights in two indices are shownin Table B 10.2.

The most notable change in the household consumptionhas been the sharp decline in the share of expenditure onfood from 68 per cent in the CCPI to 47 per cent in theCCPI(N). The CCPI also had relatively higher weightsfor kerosene, firewood, vegetables and coconut while itdid not include petrol, diesel, cooking gas, telephonecharges and tuition fees in the basket. The ‘Housing, Water,Electricity, Gas and Other Fuels’ sub group wasinadequately represented in the old index. For example, itdid not contain Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LP Gas) at all,and the weight for electricity too was insignificant. Theshares of expenditure on utilities and other services suchas communication and education were comparatively low

as well. CCPI(N) is more representative in terms ofconsumer habits and covers a wider spectrum of goodsand services, and hence, is a more reliable indicator ofoverall movement in consumer prices. Therefore, CCPI(N)is now being used as the official index for measuringinflation in Sri Lanka. The index would be revised atregular intervals of five years to capture the changingconsumption patterns.

poses. Table B 10.4 summarises the measures adopted bycertain countries, both industrialised as well as emergingeconomies for compilation of core inflation.

country, a policy decision was taken to discontinue withthe compilation of the five regional indices compiledby the CBSL and the Sri Lanka Consumers' Price Index(SLCPI) compiled by the Department of Census andStatistics (DCS) during the year.

There were signs of deceleration in theinflationary pressure which was on an upwardmovement since mid 2006, as indicated by the pointto point change in CCPI(N), during early 2007.However, the trend reversed and inflation acceleratedmainly during the second half of 2007. The risinginflation, as indicated by point to point increases,declined from 15.2 per cent in February, 2007 to 13.2per cent by May, 2007. However, it increased graduallysince then and accelerated over the fourth quarter,registering 18.8 per cent in December, 2007 comparedto 13.5 per cent in December 2006, culminating in anannual average increase of 15.8 per cent for the year2007, as against a 10.0 per cent increase in 2006.

Price increases of both imported anddomestically produced goods contributed to theoverall inflation. The overriding influence on inflationwas dominated by domestically produced goods, whichaccount for around 74 per cent of total consumptionexpenditure. However, the contribution from theimported items to the overall inflation increased duringthe year rising from 28.7 per cent in January, 2007 to39.7 per cent by December, 2007 influenced by highimport prices of both food and non-food items.

When different sub indices of the index areconsidered, the major contribution to the overallindex came from food sub index, which has thehighest weight in the CCPI(N). The food sub indexrecorded a 25 per cent increase on a point to pointbasis in December, 2007 recording an annual averageincrease of 20 per cent by the year end. This sub indexwas responsible for more than 60 per cent of the overallpoint to point increase. The price increases of rice,bread, meals bought from outside, milk powder, coconut

16 per cent. The annual average increase of 26.5 percent in Petroleum sub index, having the second highestweight, was a result of the upward revision in domesticfuel prices several times during the year. Thecontribution to the overall increase from this sector wasaround 14 per cent. Similarly, Transport and Electricalitems sub groups recorded increases of 21 per centand 24 per cent, respectively. This was mainly due tothe increase in raw materials, local rubber andinternational metal prices. Alcoholic drinks sub sectoralso had an average increase of 11.7 per cent due tothe increase in excise duty (12.5%) and BTT (3%) onalcoholic drinks during the first quarter and the revisionof excise duty (2.1%) in November, 2007.

On the basis of origin of goods, Exports subsector was largely responsible for the overallincrease in the index. The Exports group increasedat a steady pace during the year, registering an annualaverage increase of 36.1 per cent for the year. Itcontributed 51 per cent to the overall increase in theindex. This was largely due to high international pricesdriven by increased global demand for rubber and tea,mainly arising from global supply shortages coupledwith the increased crude oil prices. Imports sub sectorincreased by around 25 per cent mainly due to the priceincrease in imported items such as petroleum, wheatgrain, imported rice and milk powder. This sectoraccounted for around 26 per cent of the overallincrease. Domestic sector had a relatively lower growthof around 13.9 per cent, influenced mainly by the priceincrease in local food items such as paddy, coconut,fish and vegetables, transport equipment, machinerysuch as water pumps and sewing machines, cementand liquor.

Under the end user classification, Consumergoods had the dominant influence of more than 75per cent on the overall increase for the year. Thissub index, with a share of 75 per cent, mainlycomprising of food items behaved very similar to thefood sub index and grew by 28.3 per cent. The increasein Intermediate group by 20 per cent was as a result ofprice increases in transport equipment (tyres andautomotive batteries), fertilizer, footwear, electricalitems (dry battery cells, fans, switches, insulated wires,refrigerators) and minor agricultural export items suchas tobacco and cocoa. Meanwhile, Investment goodswhich has the lowest share among the three groups,had a marginal impact on the index. The slow growthin the prices of building material items such as cement,bricks, asbestos sheets, wall paint, s-lon pipes and torsteel during the year contributed largely to thisdevelopment. Scarcity of cement during the year was

and coconut oil in 2007 were the key food items whichimpacted heavily on the index. The price increase ofLP gas by 14 per cent in 2007 over 2006 had asubstantial indirect impact on the prices of mealspurchased outside.

The other sub indices with significantcontributions were Housing, water, electricity, gasand other fuels, and Transport, which contributedaround 20 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively tothe overall increase in 2007. The contributions fromthese two sub groups were significant compared toother sub groups owing to their high weights of around18.3 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively in theCCPI(N) basket. Except for the Communication subindex, which registered a decline in the cost, all othersub indices recorded increases (ranging from 2.1 percent to 20.3 per cent) during 2007. However, theirindividual contributions to the overall increase in theindex were less than 2 per cent as weights attached tothem were relatively low.

Wholesale Price Index (WPI)

Prices at the primary market level rose at ahigher intensity than the retail prices, as reflectedby the WPI. WPI measures overall movements ofprices, at producer level, of a wide range of goodscovering consumer, intermediate and investment aswell as those imported and those produced for exportand for local uses. However, it suffers from a somewhatoutdated weight structure which is based on thecomposition of goods produced and imported in 1974.The WPI commenced with an accelerating pathcontinuing from the previous year, but showed signsof deceleration towards the beginning of the secondquarter. This was due to the arrival of the domesticagriculture production into the market. However, withthe price developments thereafter, WPI increasedsteadily to record a point to point increase of 26.8 percent by December, 2007 compared to 17.3 per cent in2006. Consequently, the annual average increase was24.4 per cent for the year as against 11.7 per cent inthe last year.

The main contributor to the rise in the index wasthe food category, which has a weight of around68 per cent. On average, the food sub indexcontributed for around 72 per cent of the overallincrease during the year. This was mainly due to thesharp increase in food prices, both domestic andimported, particularly during the second half of the year.When total increase in the food sub index is considered,exports based food commodities contributed for around64 per cent, while imported food items added around

evident due to a regional scarcity of cement and clinkercoupled with the massive growth in the constructionindustry in ASEAN region. However, due to thegovernment policy of declaring cement as an essentialgood, the increase in cement price was containedduring the year.

GDP Deflator

Overall price change in the economy, asmeasured by the GDP deflator, rose by 14 per centin 2007 compared with 11.3 per cent recorded in2006. Agriculture sector recorded a relatively higherinflation rate of 21.6 per cent during the year, comparedto the low growth of last year. The inflation in theservices sector continued its increasing trend, whichrose further from 11.3 per cent in 2006 to 14.3 per centin 2007, the main contributors being trade and transportsectors. The lowest rate of inflation of 10.5 per centduring the year was in the industry sector, whichdecelerated from 12.5 per cent in 2006, mainly drivenby the slow growth in the manufacturing sector prices.

4.3Wages

According to the employment status of labour,there are two types of income earners, namely,wage earners and non-wage earners in the labour

market. Developments in wages have a significantbearing on consumer prices. Hence, assessingdevelopments in wages is a vital input for effective policymaking. Movements in wages are monitored throughWage Rate Indices.

Wages in Sri Lanka can be analysed under twomain categories of employment, namely, publicsector and private sector. The public sector consistsof government and the semi-government sectors whilethe private sector comprises of formal and informalsectors. Wage developments in the public sector aremonitored through the wage indices computed by theCentral Bank, covering non-executive grades andminor employees in the central government, and thegovernment school teachers while those in the formalprivate sector are based on wage rate indicescomputed by the Department of Labour for agriculture,industry and commerce, and services sectors. Themovements of wages in the informal sector are basedon the wage information collected from the CountryWide Data Collection System (CWDCS) of the CentralBank.

Public Sector Wages 2

The public sector employees enjoyed asignificant wage increase in 2007, following the2006 Budget proposals of the government. Thisincrease was mainly due to the payment of remaining50 per cent of the new salary scale (which was basedon the difference between the new salary scalesimplemented with effect from January 1, 2006 and thesalaries paid in December, 2005 inclusive of allallowances) and the increase in the cost of livingallowance (COLA).

sector employees were initially granted a COLA of Rs.1,000/- per month in January, 2006, subject to amaximum upward revision of Rs.375/- every sixmonths. Accordingly, this has risen up to Rs. 2,125/-by July 01, 2007 from Rs. 1,750/- in January, 2007.This increase had a positive impact on both the nominaland real wage rate indices of all categories of publicsector employees, as reflected in the wage rate indicesfor non-executive employees, minor employees andgovernment school teachers. However, both nominaland real wage increases of public sector employeeswere lower in 2007 than in 2006.

In addition to above salary revisions, thegovernment further decided to amend the salaryscales of government officers other than those ofthe senior level groups, with effect from June 01,2007, on the recommendations of the NationalSalaries and Cadre Commission (PublicAdministration circular No.06/2006(IV) of August24, 2006). Consequent to all these revisions, NominalWage Rate Index (NWRI) of central governmentemployees for the year 2007 recorded an increase of21.5 per cent compared with the previous year, whichwas the combined outcome of the rise in the nominalwage rate indices of non-executive officers (by 22.4per cent) and minor employees (by 20.5 per cent) in2007. The NWRI of government school teachers toorecorded an increase of 18.9 per cent over the previousyear. These increases when adjusted for inflation, ledto increases in the real wages within a range of 1-4 percent for different categories. This gain has been ontop of the real wage increases in a range of 12-16 percent enjoyed by public sector employees in the previousyear.

Formal Private Sector Wages 3

Wages of the formal private sector employeesare governed by regulations under the WagesBoard Trades, which are tripartite bodiesrepresenting employers, workers and thegovernment. As such, the wage increases in the formalprivate sector were influenced by the wage increasesof individual contracts, collective agreements, unilateraldecisions by employers and minimum wage decisionsof Wages Boards. Movements of their wages aremonitored through the minimum wage rate indices thatcover only the minimum wage categories of employeesgoverned by these Boards.

Nominal wages in the three major employmentcategories of the formal private sector, namelyagriculture, industry and commerce, and services,as reflected by the minimum wage rate indices, roseby 16 per cent, 40 per cent and 36 per cent,respectively in 2007 while the overall index for thewhole sector recorded a nominal increase of 21 percent, which was a significant improvement ascompared with a marginal increase of 2 per cent inthe previous year. As a result, these employees, onaverage, enjoyed a real wage increase of 2.7 per centin 2007, in contrast to a real wage loss of 10 per centsuffered in 2006. However, the agriculture sectoremployees continued to suffer a further marginal lossin real wage by 1.6 per cent during 2007. Theemployees in the industry and commerce sector andservice sector enjoyed real wage increases of 18 percent and 16 per cent, respectively as against the lossesof 11-12 per cent experienced in 2006. In general,situation could be different from what is reflected inthese minimum wage rate indices as they do not coverwages earned by executives and professional classesin these sectors.

The rise in the nominal wages in 2007 wasmainly due to the raise in the minimum wages forworkers (who earn monthly salary and aregoverned by the Wages Board Trades), up to Rs.5,000/- with effect from May 01, 2007 and theextending of the Collective Agreement entered intobetween the Plantation Companies and TradeUnions on December 19, 2006 to cover allemployees engaged in Tea and Rubber Growingand Manufacturing Trades governed by the WagesBoard Trades. This enabled such employees in Teaand Rubber Growing and Manufacturing Trades too toreceive the Rs. 260/- daily remuneration package asthose in Plantation Companies, with effect from June01, 2007. As a result, the Minimum Wage Rate Indicesof workers in Wages Board Trades increased in Mayand June, 2007.

Informal Private Sector Wages

The informal private sector comprises allemployees who fall outside the public sector andformal private sector. They are not registered withthe Labour Commissioner and therefore, not coveredby any formal retirement benefit scheme. Nominalwages in the informal private sector are determined ina more free market environment. The wage informationin this sector pertaining to agriculture and buildingconstruction, is collected under the Country Wide DataCollection System (CWDCS) of the Central Bank.

3The Formal Private Sector is defined as the sector consisting of private sectorinstitutions that contribute to the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) or maintaintheir own funds (any such contributory retirement benefit scheme) with theapproval of the Commissioner of Labour.

The information on the daily wages of thesesectors revealed an upward movement at differentrates in nominal terms while recording a decline inreal terms. Accordingly, nominal daily wages for thecoconut sector showed the highest increase of 16.4per cent, while those for tea, rubber and paddy sectorsincreased in a range of 11-16 per cent. Within theAgricultural sector, the rates of increase in daily wagesof most of the sub categories varied partly due to thediversity among different activities. The increase in dailywages in the coconut sector was mainly driven by thedemand for higher wages by workers in line with higherprices for coconut during the year. Rubber sector dailywages increased due to higher production andfavourable prices in the domestic and global markets.Despite a drop in tea production, tea workers were alsopaid higher wages due to favourable prices in the globalmarket.

Daily wages for masonry and carpentry in theconstruction sector recorded increases of 14-16 percent consequent to the continued demand forworkers for construction activities coupled with theshortages of such workers due to migration forforeign employment. However, when adjusted forinflation, their real wages dropped within a range of1.5-3.0 per cent during the year. Accordingly, asexperienced in the previous year, both the agriculture

4.4 Population, Labour Force andEmployment

Population

The mid year population is estimated at 20.0million in 2007, an increase of 0.6 per centcompared with 1.1 per cent growth in 2006. Alldistricts contributed to the expansion in population,except Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee, whichrecorded declines due to displacements resulting fromsecurity operations conducted in these districts. Highincreases in population in Colombo, Kandy andGampaha districts contributed 56 per cent to the overallgrowth.

Labour Force

The labour force is composed of theeconomically active population 10 years of age andover. This is measured by the Quarterly Labour ForceSurveys (QLFS) conducted by the DCS since 1990.Since the labour force data collected from Northernand Eastern provinces in 2006 and 2007 were notreliable and sufficient, data for 2005, 2006 and 2007are presented excluding those provinces for propercomparison purposes.

Item2005(b)2006

The annual average labour force declined by 1per cent from 7.6 million in 2006 to 7.5 million in2007. This annual decline was mainly due to the dropin labour force in second quarter of 2007. However, itrecovered afterwards and the labour force increasedup to 7.6 million by the fourth quarter of 2007. Thelabour force participation rate (LFPR), which is the ratioof the labour force to the total population aged 10 yearsand above, decreased to 49.8 per cent in 2007 from51.2 per cent in 2006. The LFPRs for male and femalewere 68 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively for 2007.

Employment

According to the QLFS, number of employedpersons, on average, stood at 7.0 million during2007 compared to 7.1 million in 2006, showing amarginal decline. This was driven by the drop inemployment during the first two quarters of 2007, whichhowever picked up towards the latter part of the year,recording 7.2 million by the fourth quarter of 2007.Persons, who worked as paid employees, employers,own account workers (self employed) or unpaid familyworkers during the survey period are said to beemployed persons in the QLFS. This includes personswith a job but not at work during the survey period.Employees temporarily absent from the work due toillness, bad weather or labour disputes are alsoconsidered as employed.

The drop in annual employment was seen in theagriculture and industry sectors. However, this

decline was mainly reflected in the first half of the year,recovering thereafter towards the third and fourthquarters of the year. The decreased employment inindustrial sector by 0.8 per cent was mainly due to thelower employment in the manufacturing sub sector by2.3 per cent, despite higher value addition in the sectorreflecting significant productivity improvements.Meanwhile, the decline of employment in the Agriculturesector by 3.7 per cent was due to lower output in thepaddy production during the second quarter 2007.These declines more than offset the positive impact ofincreased employment by 1.3 per cent in Servicessector.

According to the QLFS, the share of publicsector employment increased from 13.4 per centin 2006 to 13.8 per cent in 2007, mainly due to theexpansion in the forces and police service whilethe share of employment of private sector recorded

an increase from 42.1 per cent in 2006 to 42.7 percent in 2007. The expansion in the public sectoremployment during the reference period was alsoreflected in the Annual Public Sector EmploymentSurvey (APSES) conducted by the Central Bank.

Unemployment

According to the DCS, the unemployment ratehas dropped to the lowest ever of 5.5 per centduring the fourth quarter, recording a continueddecline in the annual rate from 6.5 per cent in 2006to 6.0 per cent in 2007. This decline was associatedwith the healthy growth experienced in all three sectorsof the economy during 2007. The implementation ofseveral programmes for job creation in bothgovernment and private sector, dissemination of labourmarket information and career guidance programmescontinued to lessen the rate of unemployment.

However, the unemployment among young agegroups was relatively higher. Youth unemployment,

This was predominantlya result of the increase in skilled and unskilled labourmigrants during this period. The Middle Eastern regioncontinued to contribute to more than 90 per cent oftotal foreign employment opportunities. However, jobplacements in Malaysia and South Korea recordeddecreases, due to non-payment of agreed salaries forworkers in Malaysia and the recruitment to South Koreawas being done only through SLBFE from this year.

The male contribution to foreign employmenthad been persistently increasing over the years.The share of male workers had further risen to 47 percent in 2007 from that of 44 per cent in 2006. Thisincrease was due to high demand for skilled andunskilled jobs for males in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAEand Jordan, particularly in construction andmanufacturing sectors. On the other hand, the totaldepartures for Saudi Arabia and Oman, suffered a set-back, mainly due to inadequate remuneration forcertain categories of employment, includinghousemaids. The growth in departures of females,particularly housemaids had been slow over the recentyears, mainly due to availability of job opportunities inSri Lanka.

Unskilled workers continue to account for asignificant share of overseas employmentdominated by housemaids. However, this dominancehas become weaker over the years, with the share ofhousemaids in foreign employment falling further from49 per cent in 2006 to 47 per cent in 2007. At the sametime, Sri Lanka has begun to explore the opportunitiesin various other areas of employment in the recent past.An apprenticeship training programme in theconstruction sector leading to an internationallyaccepted certification and similar training in hospitalitytrade were undertaken with a view to cater to thesesectors in the global market. Consequently, the migrantworkforce in the categories of skilled and unskilledlabour, other than the housemaids, increased from 42per cent in 2006 to 47 per cent in 2007.

Labour Productivity

Overall labour productivity continued to improvein 2007, following the trend experienced during thelast few years. In terms of value addition based onGDP at constant (2002) prices, it increased by around

7.7 per cent over the previous year, to Rs.317,000 peremployee, based on the employment numbers adjustedfor Northern and Eastern provinces. The considerableincrease in productivity in the Agricultural, Industrialand Services sectors contributed to the increase inoverall productivity in 2007. It is noteworthy to mentionthat the agriculture sector recorded an increase of 7.3per cent in productivity compared with a 4.3 per centdrop in 2006. The continuous increase in labourproductivity is a favourable development in order toachieve higher economic growth while reducingunemployment. This will also help contain inflationarypressures arising from other factors.

Labour Relations and Labour Market Reforms

The steady decline in the number of strikes since2004 continued in 2007 and recorded only 25 strikesin 2007 compared to 53 strikes in 2006. The numberof strikes in the plantation sector industries decreasedto 9 in 2007 compared with 19 in 2006. The total man-days lost and workers involved too dropped significantly.The number of strikes in the rest of the private sectoralso declined to 16 in 2007 from 34 in 2006. However,the total man-days lost increased by 36 per cent thoughthe number of workers involved declined dramaticallyby more than 55 per cent in this category. This was mainlydue to a stoppage of work at Sevenagala SugarCompany for twenty days and strikes launched byworkers in some garment factories.

The private sector continued to emphasisefurther reforms in the labour market to create a goodworking environment in order to improveproductivity. Necessity for the new labour marketreforms did not arise in 2007 because industrial harmonyprevailed throughout the year as steps have been takento strengthen tripartite partners (Employers, Employeesand the Government) to participate in the developmentand implementation of labour reforms made in therecent years.

4.5 Policies and Issues

Continuation of relatively high rates ofunemployment among the educated youth andshort supply of IT qualified personnel withproficiency in English and interpersonal skillsindicate a mismatch between the supply anddemand for skilled labour categories. Therefore, thedeficiencies in the education system need to be furtherrectified. Though the need for educational reformsaccompanied by effective national level programmesfor skills developments to meet the changing conditionsin both domestic and international labour markets havebeen widely discussed and agreed, the implementationis still lagging behind.

in Sri Lanka with employment of more skilledworkers in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE andKuwait.Though Sri Lanka still caters mostly to the lowdemand unskilled labour in the Middle East, the risingdemand for professional and skilled labour in thosecountries is expected to create more employmentopportunities for construction workers such as forquantity surveyors, carpenters and masons. Further,increasing opportunities are available in other countriessuch as Canada and Japan for nurses and care-giversand hence, training of personnel to cater to thesemarkets should be increased. This would reduce thedependency on the Middle East for foreign employmentleading to more foreign employment and foreignexchange remittances.

The volatility of prices of agricultural commoditiesis a problem encountered not only by the farmers butalso agro processors and other entrepreneurs involvedin agriculture value addition. In particular, farmers whodo not have holding capacity often have to dispose oftheir harvest at depressed prices that prevail during theharvest season. Forward Sales Contracts(FSC) inagricultural commodities were introduced by the CentralBank in 1999, as a solution to a chronic problem of widelyfluctuating prices of agricultural commodities betweenthe seasons and off seasons. In an FSC, a producer andbuyer agree to purchase or sell, respectively a specifiedquantity of a commodity on a predetermined futuredate at a predetermined price. In such a contract, termslike quantity, quality, delivery date, and price are agreedupon between the buyer and seller, making each contractunique.

Even if FSCs are signed however, when the pricesagreed upon by the buyers or sellers deviate substantiallyfrom the open market price that prevails at the time thetransaction takes place, it is inevitable that there wouldbe a reluctance on the part of one of the parties tocontract at the agreed price. It has been observed that insuch instances in Sri Lanka, the parties to the contractoften arrive at a compromise price on which thetransaction takes place1.

In many countries price risk management is achievedby trading in futures contracts in a CommodityExchange. A commodity futures contract is astandardized transferable forward contract (i.e., thequantity, quality and delivery date of the underlying assetare standardized). Unlike in the case of forwardcontracts, delivery is not mandatory in futures contractsand no counter-party risk is involved, as the Exchangewhich adopts various risk mitigation schemes assumesall risks. Persons with no involvement in the physicalcommodity market also can participate in trading in aCommodity Exchange with the hope of profiting throughtheir predictive power on price movements in thephysical market and resultant price changes. Suchparticipants, called speculators, constitute the drivers ofCommodity Exchanges.

Price risk management can be achieved by tradingfutures contracts in Commodity Exchanges. A hedger

facing a risk in the physical market can mitigate such risksby taking a position in the futures market, so that any loss inthe physical market would be set off by a gain in the futuresmarket.

Eg: A farmer who sows paddy in December expectinga harvest in March faces a price risk as prices could dropdrastically at harvest time. In the circumstances, anyforward contract he enters into may not be honoured andhe may be forced to agree to a compromise price. If aCommodity Exchange exists, it is possible for the farmer tosell March paddy futures at the price prevailing in theExchange in December(say Rs. 20,000 per mt) . If paddyprices drop sharply in the physical market, the price inthe futures market would also drop as prices in the twomarkets move in tandem with each other. Therefore, thefarmer is in a position to make a profit by squaring hisposition in the futures market, as he could buy March paddyfutures at a low price (say Rs. 17, 000 per mt). Hence, theloss sustained in the physical market will be offset by theprofit made in the futures market.

In practice, however, only very large farmers wouldbe in a position to trade directly in a Commodity Exchange.As such, farmer cooperatives and other farm produceassociations with sufficient capital can trade directly in theExchange. Even small farmers would benefit as producebuyers would be able to hedge their price risk and would,therefore, be willing to offer the farmers a better price.

Commodity Exchanges bring a number of benefits. Forexample, as the ability to hedge prices would makeagriculture and agro processing industries less risky, accessto credit by these sectors would improve bringingwidespread benefits for different sectors in the economyincluding consumers. Further, as buyers and sellers in aCommodity Exchange undertake trading based on a hostof factors such as the prevailing market information, expertopinion, demand and supply conditions, governmentpolicies, inflation rates, weather forecasts, market dynamicsand hopes and fears, all of these transform into a continuousprice discovery mechanism. All new information getstransformed into a single benchmark figure which is themarket price agreed upon by the buyer and a seller. As thisprice is disseminated, markets become more integrated. Thusby watching the futures prices determined in the Exchangethe parties involved could gauge the price developments at

1It is theoretically possible to take recourse to the law to enforce the contract, but this is not a realistic option, given the time and cost involved inlitigation in the country.

practically zero search costs. An informed decision onthe crops to be sown can be made by farmers as the futuresprices prevailing in the Commodity Exchange are goodindicators of the price that is likely to prevail in the future.

Export competitiveness could also be improved bytrading in a Commodity Exchange. Exporters often needto contract in advance and, as such, are exposed to risk, ifprices of supplies to be exported go up in the physicalmarket at the time of the execution of the contract. Ifthis risk is to be avoided by purchasing supplies inadvance, capital would be tied up and a storage cost hasto be incurred. These costs will have to be factored intothe prices quoted by the exporter. By substituting a futuresmarket transaction(future purchase) for a physical markettransaction, price risk could be mitigated and a morecompetitive price could be quoted to the overseas buyer.(It should be noted that to take a position in the futuresmarket, a hedger needs to put up only a small margin ofthe value of the contract and, therefore only a smallsegment capital will be tied up). Further, it has beenfound that the quality of commodities in the physicalmarket improves over time if trading in contracts of suchcommodities take place in the Commodity Exchange.This is because trading of contracts of standardizedquality of the underlying commodity takes place in aCommodity Exchange creating greater awareness onquality standards among stakeholders. Further, for moreefficient price hedging it is necessary for the quality ofcommodities traded in the physical market to bebenchmarked against the standardized quality ofcommodities in contracts traded at the CommodityExchange. Such a situation will inevitably raise thedemand for commodities with quality corresponding tothe standardized quality/qualities in contracts traded inthe Commodity Exchange, bringing about an all roundimprovement in quality of commodities.

The extent of benefits that can accrue from aCommodity Exchange will necessarily depend on the

structure of markets, the critical mass of commoditiestraded in a country’s commodity markets and theregulatory regime in existence. India, for example, is acountry that produces several commodities as a majorproducer. Further, its commodity markets were dislocatedand were subject to market distorting trade regulations,while the value chain pertaining to agri-products in thecountry was very long. In these circumstances,widespread benefits were derived from the establishmentof Commodity Exchanges, including integration ofmarkets, robust price discovery, compression of the valuechain leading to a better margin for the farmer. The volumeof commodities traded in Sri Lanka on the other hand, isrelatively small and, as notable volumes of several majorcommodities are imported, price discovery for thesecommodities takes place abroad. Further, the value chainrelating to most commodities tends to be relativelycompressed in Sri Lanka.

An important pre-requisite for establishing aCommodity Exchange in Sri Lanka is the setting up ofan enabling legal framework with proper regulatorymechanism in place. A regulatory regime is indispensableas the economic consequences of any manipulation orundesirable speculation in the Commodity Exchange willhave much graver political and economic consequencesthan would arise, for instance, if fraud occurred in thestock exchange. The credibility of the CommodityExchange is crucial, if it is to attract large scaleparticipation and it should be set up by persons and entitiesof unimpeachable integrity. Therefore, either credibletrading associations or institutions such as banks etc.,should come forward for this purpose. The CommodityExchange should be staffed by skilled personnel who, inaddition to other skills, should have specific skills andknowledge to facilitate and regulate physical deliveriesof commodities. It is also important to have the othermarketing infrastructure, such as an organized warehousestructure and grading and assaying facilities in place,before establishing a Commodity Exchange.
