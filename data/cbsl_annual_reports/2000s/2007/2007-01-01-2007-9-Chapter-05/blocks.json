    "text": "he external sector continued to sustain itsstrong performance in 2007, largelysupported by the favourable globaleconomic environment during much of 2007. TheBalance of Payments (BOP) recorded a surplus forthe third consecutive year. Exports continued togrow amid intense global competition. In particular,exports to the EU grew substantially benefiting fromincreased access to EU markets under the GSP+scheme. Following the high performance of apparelexports, which have exceeded US dollars 3 billion since2006, tea exports exceeded the US dollars 1 billionmark in 2007. Imports also increased reflecting thehigher demand for investment and intermediate goodsand the sharp increase in international commodityprices including that of crude oil. The higherinternational prices of several essential imported goodsas compared to those of Sri Lanka\u2019s exports led to adeterioration in the country\u2019s terms of trade by 1.0 percent. The trade deficit too widened further, which waslargely offset by increased private remittances.Earnings from the export of services such astransportation, Information Technology (IT) and ITenabled services continued to increase, while therewas a decline in the earnings from tourism. Touristarrivals declined sharply during the first half of the year,but recovered substantially during the latter part of theyear. The services account surplus together with theincrease in worker remittances helped contain thecurrent account deficit, which improved as apercentage of GDP in 2007. The surplus in the capitaland financial account was more than sufficient to offsetthe deficit in the current account, leading to an overallsurplus in the BOP. Consequently, the external officialreserves of the country improved to a comfortable level,which is sufficient to finance more than 3 months ofimports.",

Much of the increase in exports of garmentsand textiles could be attributed to the concessionsreceived by Sri Lanka in respect of its exports tocountries in the European Union under the GeneralisedSystem of Preferences (GSP+) scheme. The share ofgarments exported to the European Union furtherincreased to 45 per cent in 2007, from 40 per cent and36 per cent in 2006 and 2005, respectively.Nevertheless, the USA continued to be the largestsingle market for Sri Lanka\u2019s garment exports,accounting for nearly 50 per cent of the garmentexports. Amongst the members of the European Union,the United Kingdom was the largest market for SriLanka\u2019s garment exports, accounting for 25 per centof the total garment exports in 2007, followed by Italyand Germany, which accounted for 9 per cent and 5per cent, respectively. These statistics highlight thevery high degree of concentration of markets forgarment exports and hence the sensitivity of thecountry\u2019s export performance to developments in a fewindustrialised countries. With respect to other sub-categories of industrial exports, food, beverages andtobacco, rubber products, diamonds and jewellery, andmachinery and equipment were amongst those whichrecorded significant growth.",

    "text": "The year 2007 was another favourable yearfor tea, the largest source of export earningsamong agricultural commodities. For the first timein the history of tea exports in Sri Lanka, earningscrossed the US dollars 1 billion benchmark in 2007.It has taken nearly 17 years for tea exports to doubleits earnings. Although shocks such as labour unionaction directed at wage increases and delayedapplication of fertilizer due to drought and a sharprise in the prices of fertilizer resulted in a drop inproduction, strong demand particularly for low growntea from Middle Eastern and CIS countries, pushedthe average price of tea exported from Sri Lankafurther up. The Middle East and CIS countries, whichconstituted the largest markets for Sri Lanka\u2019s teaexports, accounted for about 24 per cent and 50 percent, respectively, of the total tea exports in 2007.Their strong demand for the unique features ofCeylon tea is partly attributed to their rising incomesin line with rising oil prices. Increasing unionised actionin the tea sector meanwhile remains an issue ofconcern, given that it can affect the long-run viability ofcompanies producing tea as well as thecompetitiveness of tea exported from Sri Lanka ininternational markets. With respect to exports of otheragricultural commodities, rubber exports furtherincreased in 2007, responding to the rising trend ininternational prices of natural rubber, which in turn wasa consequence of the increase in the price of syntheticrubber following the increase in petroleum prices.

Similarly, the average exportprice of rubber, which was US dollars 2.13 per kilogramin 2007, compared to the average price of US dollars1.99 per kilogram in 2006, further increased towardsthe end of 2007. This was driven partly by the historicalhigh oil prices and short term supply concerns. Giventhe pressure exerted by the rise in exports from Chinaand other countries, prices of apparel remainedsubdued in 2007 and there seemed to be little prospectof any favourable increase in the near term. The exportprices of coconut and other agricultural products suchas cinnamon, pepper, cloves and tobacco alsoincreased in 2007. With respect to imports, prices ofcereals increased significantly in international marketsduring 2007 mainly due to drought related supplyshortages in producer countries such as Australia.International prices of dairy products also increasedconsequently mainly as a result of higher animal feedcosts, strong import demand from developing countriesand supply tightness. Prices of both wheat and milkproducts reached unprecedented high levels in 2007.Likewise, prices of rice have also risen reflecting thetightening of market conditions in key exportingcountries. In contrast to the developments discussedabove, in 2007, international prices of sugar, whichdeclined somewhat in the last quarter of 2006 followinga gradual but notable increase since early 2004, weredriven down further by surpluses in production.",

    "text": "Gross inflows on account of transportationservices consisting of freight charges, port relatedactivities and passenger fares increased by 11.9per cent to US dollars 840 million in 2007. This wasmainly led by a substantial increase in port relatedactivities resulting from a higher volume of cargohandling and increased earnings from passenger faresdue to the expansion of flying destinations, flying hoursand flying frequency by the Sri Lankan Airlines and theoperations of the newly set up national budget carrier,Mihin Lanka. The suspension of the regular operationsby a few foreign airlines for a certain period during theyear due to security concerns created additionalopportunities for national carriers to fly morepassengers. Earnings from port related activitiesincreased with the growth in container handling at theColombo port, especially with a substantial growth intransshipment container handling, which grew by 10.6per cent. The growth in transshipment containerhandling could be attributed to the continuing higheconomic growth, India\u2019s expanding international tradeand the improvement in service delivery at the Colomboport. To sustain the growth in port related activitiesand to successfully meet the future challenges fromcompeting ports in the region, it is vital to implementthe identified port development projects such as theColombo South Harbour project, without further delay.Any delay in the implementation of projects would notonly lead to cost escalation but may also shift businessfrom the Colombo port to other competing ports in theregion thereby retarding the future earnings potentialof the port related services. Meanwhile, outflows onaccount of transportation increased at a rate of 10.6per cent, in line with a higher growth in imports and anincrease in Sri Lankans travelling abroad for leisure,employment, education and healthcare purposes. Thecompetitive air travel packages offered by severalairlines to several regional countries have largelycontributed to the increase in the outbound travelling.",

As a result, earnings from tourism declined toUS dollars 385 million in 2007 from US dollars 410million in 2006. Nevertheless, several initiatives weretaken in 2007. By way of relief measures taken tosupport the industry, the government approved thepostponement of the US Dollars 10 visa fee imposedby the Budget 2006, the temporary deferment of VATpayable on tourism operations, the suspension ofpenalty on delayed VAT payments and the moratoriaon capital payments. The most noteworthydevelopment in 2007 was the promulgation of theTourism Act No. 38 of 2005 with effect from 1st October2007. With the implementation of the Act, Sri LankaTourism Development Authority, Sri Lanka TourismPromotion Bureau, Sri Lanka Convention Bureau andSri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Managementcame into existence, boosting the role of the privatesector. The new Tourism Act will hopefully generate amore effective public-private partnership in themanagement and the control of the tourism industry.As the private sector is the major player in this sector,its contribution to the formulation of tourism policy andpromotional activities in targeted foreign markets aswell as domestic initiatives, is likely to be enhancedwith a facilitative role being played by the government.With respect to the purpose of visit, of the total touristarrivals in 2007, 67 per cent arrived for holiday",
