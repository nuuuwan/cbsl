Chapter 5

5.1Overview

he external sector continued to sustain itsstrong performance in 2007, largelysupported by the favourable globaleconomic environment during much of 2007. TheBalance of Payments (BOP) recorded a surplus forthe third consecutive year. Exports continued togrow amid intense global competition. In particular,exports to the EU grew substantially benefiting fromincreased access to EU markets under the GSP+scheme. Following the high performance of apparelexports, which have exceeded US dollars 3 billion since2006, tea exports exceeded the US dollars 1 billionmark in 2007. Imports also increased reflecting thehigher demand for investment and intermediate goodsand the sharp increase in international commodityprices including that of crude oil. The higherinternational prices of several essential imported goodsas compared to those of Sri Lanka’s exports led to adeterioration in the country’s terms of trade by 1.0 percent. The trade deficit too widened further, which waslargely offset by increased private remittances.Earnings from the export of services such astransportation, Information Technology (IT) and ITenabled services continued to increase, while therewas a decline in the earnings from tourism. Touristarrivals declined sharply during the first half of the year,but recovered substantially during the latter part of theyear. The services account surplus together with theincrease in worker remittances helped contain thecurrent account deficit, which improved as apercentage of GDP in 2007. The surplus in the capitaland financial account was more than sufficient to offsetthe deficit in the current account, leading to an overallsurplus in the BOP. Consequently, the external officialreserves of the country improved to a comfortable level,which is sufficient to finance more than 3 months ofimports.

The government successfully launched itsdebut international bond issue, which wasoversubscribed by over three times, reflectinginternational investor confidence in the Sri Lankaneconomy. With this international bond issue and

foreign investors’ subscriptions to rupee denominatedTreasury bonds, foreign capital inflows to thegovernment reached a record high in 2007. Therealised Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) alsoincreased substantially during 2007 surpassing theprevious highest level recorded in 2006. The rupee,which depreciated at a relatively higher rate againstthe US dollar during the first three quarters of theyear, appreciated in the last quarter with the inflow ofthe proceeds from the debut sovereign bond issueand recorded a marginal depreciation of 0.93 per centby end 2007 and stabilised thereafter. A furtherliberalisation of the capital account in 2007 in the formof permitting foreign investors to subscribe up to 10per cent of the outstanding rupee denominatedTreasury bonds also contributed to the appreciationof the rupee with increased foreign fund inflows tothe country. The recent stabilisation of the Sri Lankarupee underlines the need for export and importcompeting sectors to focus more on productivityimprovements in order to maintain externalcompetitiveness. Meanwhile, the total external debtof the country as a percentage of GDP increasedmarginally in 2007, mainly due to Sri Lanka’s debutinternational sovereign bond issue and foreignsubscriptions to Treasury bonds.

5.2 External Sector Policies andInstitutional Support

The external sector continued to operate in afree and liberal economic environment with specialemphasis on the expansion of trade in goods andservices through harmonious development ofeconomic relations with major trading partners.Current account convertibility, the floating exchangerate regime and the further liberalised capital accounthelped improve the external sector. The government’spolicy on exports envisaged higher earnings throughincreased value addition and equitable regionaleconomic development to ensure that benefits thusgenerated would reach the grass roots.

The depth of openness continued to remainhigh as reflected in the low average tariff rate of4.1 per cent in 2007. This compares well with SriLanka’s average bound tariff level of 37.8 per cent.Inaccordance with the legal commitments made to theWTO by Sri Lanka, the relevent tariff rates aremaintained below the bound tariff levels.Tariffs remainthe main trade policy instrument. The five-band tariffstructure of 0, 2.5, 6, 15 and 28 per cent, which wasintroduced in 2004 continued to prevail in 2007.Preferential tariffs were offered on imports underbilateral and regional trade agreements. Thesedevelopments promoted market access, transparencyand predictability in the external trading environment.However, duty rates on consumer goods were subjectto frequent changes in 2007 in order to provide reliefto consumers particularly in the festive seasons andshield domestic producers from a surge in imports. Theother charges applicable to imports in 2007 were asurcharge on customs duty (10 per cent of customsduty), VAT, Port and Airport Development Levy (PAL),Social Responsibility Levy (SRL), Excise Duty (onalcohol, tobacco products and vehicles) and a cesson non-essential consumer items. Meanwhile, singlespecific customs duty rates were introduced on tenselected food items, instead of the surcharge onimports, the VAT, the SRL, a cess and other chargesapplicable at the customs.

Sri Lanka is firmly engaged in the bilateral andregional trading agreements, while upholdingmultilateral initiatives in WTO fora as the long termstrategy to strengthen the country’s position in theglobal trading system. The integration of thedomestic economy with those of the trading partnersas envisaged by entering into trading arrangementsled not only to straightforward economic gains asspecifically stated in the agreements, but also to amultiple of spin-off benefits beyond those envisagedin such agreements. With a view to strengthening thetraditional ties and developing Sri Lanka as the SouthAsian trading hub, the country, as an active memberof the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), the

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

Asia-Pacific Trade Arrangement (APTA), the Bay ofBengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical andEconomic Cooperation (BIMST-EC) and the IndianOcean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation(IORARC), consistently supported further regionalintegration.

As per the road map of the Indo-Sri Lanka FreeTrade Agreement (ISLFTA), following sequentialliberalization, the extent of insulation for non-sensitive products has been gradually removed.Except for sensitive products, all other items from Indiawill enter Sri Lankan markets duty free from the end ofMarch 2008. Although Sri Lanka has been accordedsuch concessions far back in 2003, Sri Lanka stilldepends heavily on a few export items and lags inexport diversification. Thus, stern efforts need to betaken by the exporters to exploit the benefits availed tothem by this agreement, as India is a country with arapidly growing economy. Negotiation under theComprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement(CEPA) with India helped resolve some existingbarriers to trade. One pillar of CEPA negotiations was

for an expansion of trade in goods between the twocountries. India agreed to remove port restrictions thatlimited imports of tea to come in only through two Indianports, namely, Calcutta and Cochin. The removal willenable Sri Lankan exporters to utilise the Tariff RateQuota (TRQ) of 12.5 million kg of tea under ISLFTA.India also agreed to provide a TRQ of 3 million piecesof garments without any condition on sourcing of fabricsand port restrictions, for which procedures foroperationalisation has been completed.

Since the implementation of the Pakistan-SriLanka Free Trade Agreement (PSLFTA) in 2005, SriLanka’s exports to Pakistan have increased by 27per cent by 2007. By 2007 Sri Lanka’s exports havebeen accorded 67 per cent tariff reduction whereasPakistan has received 40 per cent tariff reduction forgoods exported to Sri Lanka. The balance of tradecontinued to be in favour of Pakistan, as Sri Lanka’sexports had not increased as expected. Although SriLanka’s major export items such as apparel and teaare on the negative list, tariff rate quotas (TRQs) andhigher margins of tariff preferences are available onthese items. However, the performance of Sri Lanka’sexports under the PSLFTA has been poor, mainly dueto the low utilization of TRQs. Pakistan has grantedTRQs for 10,000 metric tons of tea per annum at azero rate of duty, 1,200 metric tons of betel leaves perannum at a preferential margin of 35 per cent and 3million pieces of garments at a zero rate of duty. Bothcountries have agreed to expand the scope of thecurrent agreement into a Comprehensive EconomicPartnership Agreement (CEPA) by incorporatingservices, investment and customs cooperation, whichwould help both countries realise their trade andinvestment potential and further deepen bi-lateralrelations.

Sri Lanka was able to create trade opportunitiesin the EU market due to increased market accessunder the Generalised System of Preferences(GSP+) scheme. With regard to apparel, benefits underthe GSP+ scheme were instrumental in meeting thechallenges in the international market and helpedtransform the industry from a contract manufacturer toa fully integrated service provider. As per the objectivesof the GSP+ scheme, which promotes rapidindustrialisation by developing backward integrationand creating new industries, noticeable developmentshave taken place across many industries. In additionto the establishment of large scale knitted factories andancillary product manufacturing units, the majorexporters of apparel have continued to focus oncapacity building of the apparel industry. By increasingtheir commitment to ethical and sustainable practicesthrough maintaining a balance between profit and socioand environmental factors, major apparel exportersstrove to become total solution providers to world classcompanies producing branded clothing.

Preferential Trading Arrangements which lead to FreeTrade Agreements (FTAs) are either bilateral, involvingonly two countries or multilateral, involving more thantwo countries but not the whole world. They usually intendto lower trade barriers among participating countries and,as a consequence, increase the degree of economicintegration among the member countries. Typically, thesetrade agreements increase access to each member country’smarkets by reducing tariff for member countries in amutually beneficial manner. FTAs create a level playingfield in international trade among the members andencourage member governments to adopt open andtransparent procedures for the benefit of all membersequally. An FTA creates a win-win situation in anenvironment of mutually beneficial rule based systemwhich does not deal only with trade but also with foreigndirect investment, government procurement, etc. Thestraightforward economic gains and other spin-off benefitsto be realised from the FTAs would expand across allsectors of the member countries.

A scheme like the Generalised System of Preferences(GSP+) which has immensely benefited exportsoriginating from Sri Lanka is a non-reciprocal unilateralinstrument of trade development offering preferentialmarket access. Under GSP+ preferential access to EUcountries, a concession was offered to countries like SriLanka in return for ratification and implementation of 27international conventions on good governance, humanrights, environment and labour standards. Unlike the othertrade agreements, a non-reciprocal agreement does notprovide direct benefits to the importing country, and inthe case of GSP+, the EU, which includes 27 Europeancountries. The GSP+ scheme is reviewed by the EU everythree years and the current scheme is therefore to bereviewed in the second half of 2008. The continuation ofnon-reciprocal concessions beyond the initially offeredperiod depends not only on the successful implementationand ratification of all the conventions, but also on socio-political and trade policies of the EU countries and, hence,there always exists a risk on the continuation of preferentialconcessions.

Preferential Trade Access and its Implications

The economic gains that are realised from FTAs andthe GSP+ scheme are short-term in nature. Non-reciprocaltrade agreements may be terminated at any time bywithdrawing preferential market access to exports from thebeneficiary country. The gains from the other FTAs alsomay gradually diminish over time. The establishment ofsuccessful FTAs creates incentives for non-membercountries either to seek membership of the existing FTAsor establish new FTAs. Therefore, more and moreeconomies would seek FTAs particularly with large tradingpartners, and, hence, preferences in the existing FTAs wouldgradually be eroded.

Meanwhile, excessive reliance on short-term benefitsfrom FTAs and the GSP+ scheme may have resulted in amis-allocation of productive resources. The total resourceallocations will therefore, be unproductive in the event ofan erosion of preferences or a withdrawal of tariff and dutyconcessions already granted.

Therefore, advance strategic preparation by marketplayers has become increasingly important to maintain thecompetitiveness and sustainability of the expansion intothe overseas markets, while consolidating the gains inexternal markets availed by the short-term concessions ofFTAs. The experience gained through the participation inthe preferential trade agreements could be used to becomeglobally competitive entities, through long term strategies,focusing on impending competitive markets withoutcontinuously depending on FTAs and non-reciprocalagreements like the GSP+ scheme.

The future of a country's foreign trade will alwaysdepend on its comparative advantage and, as focused inrecent times, competitive advantages. In a modern worldwhere Information and Communication Technology (ICT)has become of paramount importance, competitiveadvantage has now become a main determinant of foreigntrade expansion. This requires local industries to raiseproductivity and efficiency in production so as tosuccessfully compete with the rival producers in other partsof the world.

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

Bilateral relations between Iran and Sri Lankamade greater strides in 2007. The two countriesstressed their determination to further promote mutualcooperation in economic, trade, cultural, scientific andtechnological fields. The recent negotiations resultedin the signing of several Memoranda of Understandingin relation to the Uma Oya Multipurpose DevelopmentProject, the Expansion of the Sapugaskanda OilRefinery, Cooperation in Maritime Shipping, anagreement on Customs Cooperation and providing nointerest credit terms (four months) for petroleumpurchases. It was also agreed to promote tourismbetween the two countries.

Being a small country with limited domesticdemand, the consequential low scale of production

results in a higher cost of production relative tothat of Sri Lanka’s competitors. Therefore, as in thecase of tea, the exporters need to pursue strategies todifferentiate their products in terms of quality to gainan edge in international markets. Such differentiation,which requires value addition, would drive the processto create Sri Lankan brands and vice versa. Althoughsupply chain issues drove prices up in 2007, Sri Lanka’stea was able to secure a premium price in theinternational market. However, to facilitate sustaininga better position in the international market, tea as wellas other products require to be validated and certifiedfor conformity of the different international standards.In its endeavour to carve out a niche position in theinternational market, the apparel industry hasstrategically launched the “garments without guilt”

campaign on the basis of ethical manufacturingstandards, which support rural employment andempowering women and prohibit child labour.Historically, Sri Lanka’s strengths lay with its qualityproducts such as genuine cinnamon, Ceylon sapphire,Ceylon tea, high quality copra and ceramic products.These industries were further supported in recent yearsby the infusion of technology and product development.Trade agreements have availed opportunities toexporters to export items duty free or at preferentialtariff rates. However, it may be noted that the tradingpartners pursue trade arrangements with othercountries too, giving tariff preferences, while alsolowering the bound tariff levels in relation to WTOcommitments. Therefore, it is imperative to expandmarkets and products in these preferential markets andconsolidate the position through quality products beforebenefits and preferences erode.

The government has continued to facilitatetrade through various forms of support. The BOIcontinued to function as the central facilitation pointfor investors. A large number of export processingzones with business-friendly regulations and attractiveincentives such as full tax holidays (3 to 15 years),concessionary tax rates (after tax holidays), exemptionsfrom exchange controls, duty free concessions forimports of capital goods and raw material and allowingrepatriation of capital/dividends resulted in the BOIapproved industries accounting for more than 65 percent of total exports in recent years. Other majorinstitutions involved in facilitating external trade werethe Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the Sri LankaExport Credit Insurance Corporation and the Sri LankaStandards Institution.

Export Performance

Earnings from exports increased further in2007, with increases in volumes as well as pricesin respect of some key categories of exports.Initiatives taken by exporters to meet intensifyingcompetition in international markets, tradingarrangements between Sri Lanka and her key tradingpartners as well as the favourable performance ofexport destination countries in terms of economicgrowth, through much of 2007, helped raise earningsfrom industrial exports. Meanwhile, the unprecedentedrise in petroleum prices in international marketsindirectly had a favourable impact on Sri Lanka’s keyagricultural commodity exports, by raising demand forsuch exports. Consequently, export earnings in 2007totalled US dollars 7,740 million, which is an impressiveincrease of 12.5 per cent, year-on-year, compared tothe previous year.

Industrial exports expanded by 10.0 per cent in2007, largely supported by a marked increase inthe earnings from exports of garments and textiles.

Exports of garments and textiles continue to be thelargest source of foreign exchange earnings for SriLanka. Much of the increase in exports of garmentsand textiles could be attributed to the concessionsreceived by Sri Lanka in respect of its exports tocountries in the European Union under the GeneralisedSystem of Preferences (GSP+) scheme. The share ofgarments exported to the European Union furtherincreased to 45 per cent in 2007, from 40 per cent and36 per cent in 2006 and 2005, respectively.Nevertheless, the USA continued to be the largestsingle market for Sri Lanka’s garment exports,accounting for nearly 50 per cent of the garmentexports. Amongst the members of the European Union,the United Kingdom was the largest market for SriLanka’s garment exports, accounting for 25 per centof the total garment exports in 2007, followed by Italyand Germany, which accounted for 9 per cent and 5per cent, respectively. These statistics highlight thevery high degree of concentration of markets forgarment exports and hence the sensitivity of thecountry’s export performance to developments in a fewindustrialised countries. With respect to other sub-categories of industrial exports, food, beverages andtobacco, rubber products, diamonds and jewellery, andmachinery and equipment were amongst those whichrecorded significant growth.

The year 2007 was another favourable yearfor tea, the largest source of export earningsamong agricultural commodities. For the first timein the history of tea exports in Sri Lanka, earningscrossed the US dollars 1 billion benchmark in 2007.It has taken nearly 17 years for tea exports to doubleits earnings. Although shocks such as labour unionaction directed at wage increases and delayedapplication of fertilizer due to drought and a sharprise in the prices of fertilizer resulted in a drop inproduction, strong demand particularly for low growntea from Middle Eastern and CIS countries, pushedthe average price of tea exported from Sri Lankafurther up. The Middle East and CIS countries, whichconstituted the largest markets for Sri Lanka’s teaexports, accounted for about 24 per cent and 50 percent, respectively, of the total tea exports in 2007.Their strong demand for the unique features ofCeylon tea is partly attributed to their rising incomesin line with rising oil prices. Increasing unionised actionin the tea sector meanwhile remains an issue ofconcern, given that it can affect the long-run viability ofcompanies producing tea as well as thecompetitiveness of tea exported from Sri Lanka ininternational markets. With respect to exports of otheragricultural commodities, rubber exports furtherincreased in 2007, responding to the rising trend ininternational prices of natural rubber, which in turn wasa consequence of the increase in the price of syntheticrubber following the increase in petroleum prices.

export price of coconuts also increased in 2007, whichcould be attributed to the use of coconut oil for theproduction of bio-fuel internationally. However, theexport of coconuts and coconut products wasprohibited by law towards the end of 2007 as thedomestic price of coconuts rose considerably. Thiscontributed to a decline in exports of coconuts in 2007.

Import Performance

Expenditure on imports recorded relativelymodest increases during much of the year 2007mainly as a result of subdued increases inexpenditure on consumer goods imports.However, by end 2007, expenditure on importsrecorded an increase of 10.2 per cent, year-on-year,due to significant increases in expenditure on importsof investment goods and more notably, petroleum.Imports of petroleum contributed 40 per cent to theyear-on-year increase in expenditure on imports in2007, as a result of international petroleum prices risingto unprecedented levels towards the end of 2007. Themonthly average imported price of crude oil increasedfrom US dollars 59.85 a barrel in December 2006 toabove US dollars 90 a barrel in December 2007.Fertiliser, textiles and clothing and chemicals wereamong the other intermediate goods, in respect ofwhich import expenditure increased in 2007.

A positive development in respect of Sri Lanka’simports in 2007 was the 19.6 per cent growth in thecumulative expenditure on investment goods, whichaugurs well for future economic activity. Theexpansion of expenditure on imports of investmentgoods was underpinned by the accelerateddevelopment projects launched by the government andprojects undertaken by the private sector,especially in the construction, telecommunication andinformation technology sectors. The expansion ofexpenditure on investment goods imports is expectedto remain strong and will be a decisive factor in theoutcome in the performance of imports in coming years.

The growth of expenditure on consumer goodsin 2007 occurred mainly in respect of the food andbeverages category. Representing as much as 50per cent of the expenditure on consumer goodsimports, expenditure on food and beverages increasedby 11.4 per cent, mainly as a result of higherinternational prices of several key categories of foodin 2007. Higher prices in the international commoditymarkets were driven by weather related set-backs, poorharvests and stocks in major producing countries andrising standards of living in many emerging countries.As the volume of imports declined, the growth ofexpenditure on wheat was entirely driven by higherprices. Meanwhile, a sharp increase was recorded inrelation to imports of rice in 2007. This was a result

of a duty waiver being granted in respect of rice importsfrom mid-October to end-December 2007, as atemporary measure to curb the escalating rice pricesin the domestic market. With respect to imports ofconsumer durable items, a decline was recorded inthe expenditure on motor cars and cycles, which couldbe attributed to the higher effective rates of tariffsapplicable to imports of motor vehicles in 2007.

The higher growth of exports compared to thegrowth of imports helped contain the expansionof the trade deficit in 2007. The trade deficit widenedmodestly by 5.6 per cent in 2007 compared to the 34.0per cent expansion in 2006. The overall trade deficitwidened to US dollars 3,560 million in 2007 from USdollars 3,371 million in 2006.

The terms of trade in 2007 posted yet anotheryear of deterioration. Nevertheless, the favourableprices for agricultural products cushioned the adverseimpact of such deterioration. The surge in oil pricescoupled with supply tightness in the world food marketindirectly had a favourable impact on Sri Lanka’s keyagricultural products. The monthly average price of teaexported from Sri Lanka rose to the highest everrecorded level of US dollars 3.78 per kilogram inDecember 2007. The average price of tea exported

from Sri Lanka in 2007 was US dollars 3.28 perkilogram, compared to an average price of US dollars2.69 per kilogram in 2006. Similarly, the average exportprice of rubber, which was US dollars 2.13 per kilogramin 2007, compared to the average price of US dollars1.99 per kilogram in 2006, further increased towardsthe end of 2007. This was driven partly by the historicalhigh oil prices and short term supply concerns. Giventhe pressure exerted by the rise in exports from Chinaand other countries, prices of apparel remainedsubdued in 2007 and there seemed to be little prospectof any favourable increase in the near term. The exportprices of coconut and other agricultural products suchas cinnamon, pepper, cloves and tobacco alsoincreased in 2007. With respect to imports, prices ofcereals increased significantly in international marketsduring 2007 mainly due to drought related supplyshortages in producer countries such as Australia.International prices of dairy products also increasedconsequently mainly as a result of higher animal feedcosts, strong import demand from developing countriesand supply tightness. Prices of both wheat and milkproducts reached unprecedented high levels in 2007.Likewise, prices of rice have also risen reflecting thetightening of market conditions in key exportingcountries. In contrast to the developments discussedabove, in 2007, international prices of sugar, whichdeclined somewhat in the last quarter of 2006 followinga gradual but notable increase since early 2004, weredriven down further by surpluses in production.

As the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)points out, while weather related factors, which haveimpacted on cereal and dairy product prices are onlyof significance in the short to medium-term, thereare other factors that have contributed to these priceincreases, which are of significance in the long-term.Amongst these factors is the increasing use of cerealssuch as corn and maize as well as sugar and edible

As a result of the developments discussedabove, prices of exports grew by 4.2 per cent whileimport prices grew by 8.0 per cent in 2007. The termsof trade deteriorated marginally by 1.0 per cent in 2007,reflecting the higher growth in the unit value index ofimports relative to the growth in the unit value index ofexports.

Direction of Trade

The degree of concentration of Sri Lanka’sexport markets further declined in 2007, but a fewWestern countries, which account for more than50 per cent of Sri Lanka’s exports, still comprisethe largest markets. Amongst these are the USA (25per cent), the UK (13 per cent), Germany (6 per cent)and Italy (5 per cent), which are key markets forgarments and textiles and Belgium (5 per cent), thelargest market for processed diamonds exported fromSri Lanka. Although the share of exports to the USAdeclined further due to intense competition in theapparel market, the USA continued to be the mostimportant market for Sri Lanka’s exports. India, whichhas become an increasingly important market for Sri

Lanka’s exports following the implementation of theIndo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement in 2000,accounted for 7 per cent of Sri Lanka’s exports by end2007. Exports to India are dominated by exports ofvegetable oil, namely, vanaspathi, which accounted forabout 20 per cent of Sri Lanka’s exports to India in2007. Russia and the UAE, key markets for tea exports,accounted for around 3 per cent each of the totalexports and Iran, another major market for tea,accounted for 1.5 per cent of the total exports in 2007.France, Japan and the Netherlands accounted forabout 2 per cent, each, of Sri Lanka’s exports in 2007while other countries accounted for 1 per cent or lessof the total exports.

India continued to be the largest source ofimports into Sri Lanka in 2007, while Asiancountries continued to dominate Sri Lanka’simports. India’s share in Sri Lanka’s total importsfurther increased to 23 per cent in 2007, with Sri Lankaimporting refined petroleum as well as severalconsumer durable items such as motor vehicles and alarge number of commodities such as sugar, rice,onions and cement. Other Asian countries from whichSri Lanka sourced its imports were Singapore (10 percent), China (8 per cent), Iran (7 per cent), Hong Kong(6 per cent), Japan (4 per cent), the UAE (3 per cent)and Malaysia (3 per cent).

5.4 Trade in Services, Income, Transfersand Current Account Balance

Trade in Transportation Services

Gross inflows on account of transportationservices consisting of freight charges, port relatedactivities and passenger fares increased by 11.9per cent to US dollars 840 million in 2007. This wasmainly led by a substantial increase in port relatedactivities resulting from a higher volume of cargohandling and increased earnings from passenger faresdue to the expansion of flying destinations, flying hoursand flying frequency by the Sri Lankan Airlines and theoperations of the newly set up national budget carrier,Mihin Lanka. The suspension of the regular operationsby a few foreign airlines for a certain period during theyear due to security concerns created additionalopportunities for national carriers to fly morepassengers. Earnings from port related activitiesincreased with the growth in container handling at theColombo port, especially with a substantial growth intransshipment container handling, which grew by 10.6per cent. The growth in transshipment containerhandling could be attributed to the continuing higheconomic growth, India’s expanding international tradeand the improvement in service delivery at the Colomboport. To sustain the growth in port related activitiesand to successfully meet the future challenges fromcompeting ports in the region, it is vital to implementthe identified port development projects such as theColombo South Harbour project, without further delay.Any delay in the implementation of projects would notonly lead to cost escalation but may also shift businessfrom the Colombo port to other competing ports in theregion thereby retarding the future earnings potentialof the port related services. Meanwhile, outflows onaccount of transportation increased at a rate of 10.6per cent, in line with a higher growth in imports and anincrease in Sri Lankans travelling abroad for leisure,employment, education and healthcare purposes. Thecompetitive air travel packages offered by severalairlines to several regional countries have largelycontributed to the increase in the outbound travelling.

Travel and Tourism

The year 2007 saw a set-back in tourism, withtourist arrivals declining by 11.7 per cent to494,008 in 2007 from 559,603 in 2006. Traveladvisories issued by major tourist originating countriesincluding the UK, Germany, Australia, Italy and Francewere a deterrent to the progress of the tourism industry.

These advisories together with the uncertain securitysituation were reflected in the decline in arrivals fromall the major markets except the UK, the Maldives andRussia. As a result, earnings from tourism declined toUS dollars 385 million in 2007 from US dollars 410million in 2006. Nevertheless, several initiatives weretaken in 2007. By way of relief measures taken tosupport the industry, the government approved thepostponement of the US Dollars 10 visa fee imposedby the Budget 2006, the temporary deferment of VATpayable on tourism operations, the suspension ofpenalty on delayed VAT payments and the moratoriaon capital payments. The most noteworthydevelopment in 2007 was the promulgation of theTourism Act No. 38 of 2005 with effect from 1st October2007. With the implementation of the Act, Sri LankaTourism Development Authority, Sri Lanka TourismPromotion Bureau, Sri Lanka Convention Bureau andSri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Managementcame into existence, boosting the role of the privatesector. The new Tourism Act will hopefully generate amore effective public-private partnership in themanagement and the control of the tourism industry.As the private sector is the major player in this sector,its contribution to the formulation of tourism policy andpromotional activities in targeted foreign markets aswell as domestic initiatives, is likely to be enhancedwith a facilitative role being played by the government.With respect to the purpose of visit, of the total touristarrivals in 2007, 67 per cent arrived for holiday

Trade in Telecommunication and InformationTechnology Services

The net earnings from telecommunicationsdecreased by 4.3 per cent in 2007. However, theincreased utilisation of internet and email services, theincrease in International Direct Dialling (IDD)connected phone lines, and the cheaper internationalcall charges offered by both mobile and fixed linetelecommunications operators due to the increasedcompetition since the liberalisation of the internationaltelecommunication gateway in 2003, have encouragedSri Lankans to use more internationaltelecommunication services. As a result, outflows onaccount of telecommunication services have continuedto grow since 2003.

The earnings from exports of software,Information Technology (IT) enabled services suchas Business Process Outsourcing (BPO),Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) and otherIT related services increased further in 2007.Relatively better IT infrastructure facilities, theavailability of a skilled workforce, price competitivenessand reliable and efficient service delivery helpedsustain the growth in this industry. During 2007, SriLankan companies operating in the IT andTelecommunications industry have performed well inproviding software solutions to overseas countries,especially in the Middle East and Eastern Africa. SriLanka possesses a comparative advantage inpromoting the BPO and KPO due to availability ofqualified professionals in fields such as accountancyand law. Further, Sri Lanka has the capacity to yield

more benefits from BPO and KPO industries throughspecialisation and creating a more conduciveenvironment for operating by further improving the ITinfrastructure by creating a dedicated IT zone.

Gross inflows to the income account increasedsignificantly by around 44 per cent to US dollars449 million, mainly due to the increased incomefrom investment of official external reserves of thecountry, which helped contain the widening deficitin the income account in 2007. The interest incomefrom investment of official reserves increased by 44per cent to US dollars 105 million in 2007, mainly dueto the higher global interest rates and furtheraccumulation of official reserves during 2007. Inaddition, the higher depreciation of the US dollaragainst other major currencies such as the euro, thesterling pound and the Japanese yen in 2007, resultedin a significant gain in the values of the externalreserves valued on the basis of marked to market inUS dollar terms. Earnings from the foreign financialassets of the private sector including commercial banksalso increased due to the higher global interest ratesthat prevailed in 2007. Meanwhile, outflows in theincome account also increased by around 15 per centto US dollars 807 million as a result of increasedinterest payments on external debt during the year dueto higher debt accumulation in the past, and settlementof interest deferred under the Tsunami based debtmoratorium in 2005. Repatriation of profits anddividends of the foreign direct investment enterprisesby foreign investors, which includes offsetting entryfor reinvestment of retained earnings by thoseinvestors for the expansion of existing operations ofthe foreign direct investment enterprises, alsoincreased substantially.

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

Current Transfers

Worker remittances, which grew at a higher ratefor the third consecutive year, reached US dollars2,502 million in 2007. This increase was attributablemainly to the increase in the number of migrant workersleaving for foreign employment by 8 per cent to 217,306in 2007, the increase in the average wages of migrantsin the Middle Eastern region due to the rise in incomelevel of oil producing countries such as Saudi Arabia,United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, and increasedmigration to high wage countries such as Korea,Malaysia and Singapore. The new measures taken bycommercial banks on the initiatives of the Central Bankto mobilise more remittances through creation of moreawareness among migrant workers on the benefits oftransferring money through banking channels andposting additional bank officers in several major labourhiring countries to mobilise remittances also helped toincrease the remittances in 2007. The enhancedworker remittances are estimated to have financedabout 70 per cent of the trade deficit in 2007.

Current Account Balance

The current account deficit narrowed marginallyto US dollars 1,369 million in 2007 from US dollars1,499 million in 2006. In terms of GDP, it improved to4.2 per cent of GDP in 2007 from 5.3 per cent of GDPin 2006. The increased worker remittances helped tocontain the widening current account deficit andcushion the adverse impact of higher internationalcommodity prices on the current account and exchangerates. The high current account deficit reflects the highsavings-investment gap of the country, highlighting theneed for attracting more foreign capital to meet thenecessary investment expenditure, which is requiredto achieve an economic growth rate of 7-8 per cent.

5.5Capital and Financial Flows, and Balance ofPayments

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

In 2007, the FDI inflows surpassed the previouspeak level recorded in 2006 reflecting thecontinuous investor confidence on the Sri Lankaneconomy and the prevailing investor friendlyinvestment regime in the country. The gross FDIinflows including the foreign loans obtained by the BOIapproved companies reached a record level of USdollars 734 million in 2007 from US dollars 604 millionin 2006, mainly due to a sharp increase in reinvestmentof retained earnings by existing BOI companies,especially of those engaged in the services sector. TheBOI’s initiatives under the Nipayum Centre programmeto promote investment in less developed regions hasalso contributed to the higher investment flows in 2007.The FDI inflows in 2007 consist of equity capital of USdollars 221 million, loans and advances of US dollars96 million by the shareholders, intra-company

borrowings of US dollars 63 million, foreign loans ofUS dollars 131 million and the reinvestment of retainedearnings of US dollars 223 million by the existingcompanies. Meanwhile, FDI outflows increased to USdollars 55 million in 2007 from US dollars 30 million in2006 as several local companies were permitted toinvest abroad during the year. To encourage moreforeign investment in the country, it is necessary todevelop basic infrastructure such as roads, highwaysand power supply to international standards andpromote more Public-Private Partnership (PPPs)arrangements in major infrastructure projects that arecurrently undertaken solely by the government withborrowed funds. It is also necessary to create anenabling business environment that ensure propertyrights, faster allocation of lands for new investments,sound and fast dispute settlement and greater labourmobility to achieve higher levels of FDI.

Foreign Capital to the Government

Medium and Long Term

Foreign inflows to the government consistingof both loans and grants increased substantiallyin 2007 with the successful launch of the debutsovereign bond issue. The government successfullymobilised US dollars 500 million from the internationalcapital markets with investors in all regions showing akeen interest in Sri Lanka’s debut sovereign bondsamidst sub-prime issues adversely affectinginternational capital markets. As a result, thegovernment was able to mobilise a record US dollars1.6 billion worth of loans and grants during 2007 ascompared to US dollars 1.2 billion in 2006. During theyear, total long-term and medium-term loan inflows tothe government including the sovereign bond proceedsincreased to US dollars 1,290 million compared to USdollars 932 million in 2006. Of the total loan receipts in2007, 51 per cent was received on concessional termsand the balance 49 per cent on commercial terms andconditions. This resulted in a drop in concessional loaninflows by around 6.2 per cent to US dollars 660 million.Though the proceeds of the bonds could be used forthe acceleration of project implementation it would be

more advantageous to fund large infrastructure projectsunder the Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) withforeign/local investment as debt flows increases the futuredebt burden of the government. The total grants, both ofa current and capital nature, decreased to US dollars277 million in 2007 from US dollars 287 million in 2006.During 2006, the government had received substantialamount of grants for the reconstruction of infrastructuredamaged by the Tsunami in 2004. The foreign aidutilization rate decreased marginally in 2007 to 21.2 percent from 22.5 per cent in 2006 despite the fasterimplementation of major projects that were funded bythe development partners. This was largely due tosubstantial increase in new aid commitments receivedby the government for new projects during the year, whichwill be disbursed in the next few years. Meanwhile, loanrepayments by the government increased by 40 per centto US dollars 618 million in 2007 mainly due to therepayment of two installments of the debt deferred in2005 as a result of the tsunami by Paris club members,which has to be settled in seven installments. The firstsuch installment was made in 2006.

Short-Term

Short-term net inflows by way of subscriptionsto the government Treasury bonds by foreignersamounted to US dollars 373 million in 2007. Forthe first time, the government permitted foreigners toinvest up to a maximum of 5 per cent of the value ofoutstanding Treasury bonds effective from 1 November2006 and the limit was further enhanced to up to 10per cent in December 2007. Although these bonds havelonger maturity periods, the inflows are classified asshort-term capital as there is no any mandatoryminimum holding requirements on these bonds andthe investors are free to liquidate and repatriate theirinvestment at any time. In order to mitigate volatility inthe foreign exchange market arising from any suddenoutflows of funds invested in Treasury bonds, theCentral Bank has created a special reserve, in USdollars, and is committed to supply foreign exchangethat may be demanded by the foreign bond holders torepatriate the proceeds of the bonds.

Loan Capital to the Private Sector and PublicCorporations

Foreign loan inflows to the private sector andpublic corporations increased in 2007. Long-termloan inflows to the private sector and public corporationsincreased by 43 per cent to US dollars 199 million in2007 mainly due to increased borrowing by the privatesector, specially by the BOI enterprises. Several privatesector enterprises, especially in tele-communicationsand finance sectors obtained foreign loans to financethe expansion of their businesses as the domesticinterest rates were relatively high in 2007. There wasno loan inflow to the public corporations during the yearas the government has been cautious in guaranteeingforeign loans to public corporations. However, thegovernment now encourages the private sector to raisecapital from the international capital market for theirinvestment needs. In this context, it is encouraging thatthe budget 2008 announced that the restrictions onexternal borrowings by the private sector will be reducedin 2008.

Short-Term Capital to Private Sector

Total net short-term capital inflows amountedto US dollars 206 million in 2007, compared to USdollars 610 million recorded in 2006, largely due tothe lower domestic foreign currency borrowingsby the government from the banking system. On anet basis, the government has borrowed US dollars200 million from the banking system in 2007 ascompared to US dollars 394 million in 2006. Meanwhile,the net portfolio investment inflows to the share marketreached US dollars 101 million in 2007 as comparedto US dollars 51 million in 2006. The Colombo StockExchange continues to remain one of the bestperforming markets in Asia, attracting a gross inflowof US dollars 423 million in 2007. Net foreign assets of

commercial banks increased by US dollars 280 millionin 2007 due to the investment of increased foreigncurrency deposits abroad. Meanwhile, net liabilitiesof commercial banks increased by US dollars 364million in 2007 due to a few commercial banks resortingto overseas borrowings during the year and increasein foreign currency deposits.

Balance of Payments and External Reserves

As net inflows to the capital and financialaccount were more than sufficient to offset thewidened current account deficit, the BOP recordeda surplus for the third consecutive year. The BOPsurplus amounted to US dollars 531 million in 2007,compared to the surplus of US dollars 204 million in2006. The inflow of US dollars 500 million from theissuance of sovereign international bonds mainlycontributed to this higher surplus.

External Reserves

The BOP surplus further strengthened the grossofficial reserves in 2007. The gross official reserves,excluding ACU receipts, increased to US dollars 3,063million in 2007. Despite the higher import expenditureresulting from increased international prices of crudeoil and essential commodities, reserves increased to3.3 months of imports in 2007 compared to 3.0 monthsof imports in 2006. However, the reserve adequacyas measured by the ratio of gross official reserves toshort term debt and liabilities declined to 77 per centin 2007 from 82 per cent in 2006, mainly due to thesignificant increase in short term debt and liabilities.Meanwhile, the total external reserves of the country,

excluding ACU receipts increased to US dollars 4,511million from US dollars 3,694 million due to commercialbanks building up their foreign assets with a substantialincrease in foreign currency deposits.5.6External Debt and Debt Service

External Debt

The total external debt of the country as apercentage of GDP increased marginally in 2007after declining for three consecutive years. As apercentage of GDP, the total external debt increasedto 44.1 per cent in 2007 from 43.2 per cent in 2006. InUS dollar terms, the total external debt increased byaround 17 per cent to US dollars 14,252 million in 2007.The sharp increase in external debt, in US dollar terms,was partly attributed to the weakening of the US dollaragainst other major currencies. Of the total externaldebt outstanding, 38.6 per cent was denominated inSDR, 25.7 per cent in Japanese yen and 21.3 per cent

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

the country ascending to the middle income status,access to some of the concessional loan facilities frommultilateral financial institutions is likely to wane in themedium-term. As a result, the government’s non-concessional debt stock may increase in the medium-term. However, the government could maintain the non-concessional debt stock at a manageable level byencouraging both domestic and foreign investors toundertake major infrastructure projects, perhaps inpartnership with the government. In this regard, it isnecessary to encourage the private sector, especiallythe financially sound private sector enterprises to raisemedium and long-term external loans from theinternational markets and multilateral financialinstitutions to finance such infrastructure projects andtheir own operations. This would release domesticfinancial resources to private sector enterprises thatare not capable of raising external debt.

Foreign Debt Service Payments

The total debt service payments, consisting ofboth amortisation and interest payments on allforeign debt increased by 14.1 per cent in US dollarterms but remained around 13 per cent as a ratioof earnings from merchandise exports andservices. The continuation of scheduled debtrepayments since 2006 after a one-off reduction dueto the Tsunami based debt moratorium in 2005, theincrease in defence loan repayments, increasing debtservicing costs of government’s commercial

borrowings, and the weakening of the US dollar againstmajor currencies had contributed to the increase inSri Lanka’s external debt service payments in US dollarterms, during 2007. The debt service ratios, whichmeasure the country’s capacity to service its externaldebt still remains at comfortable levels mainly due tothe large stock of concessional debt of the governmentwith long repayment periods and continuous growth inearnings from exports of goods and services.

5.7Exchange Rate Regime andExchange Rate Movements

Under the floating exchange rate regime, the SriLankan rupee no longer depreciates at a steadypace against major currencies, but responds tomarket forces of supply and demand in determiningthe exchange rate with limited intervention by theCentral Bank to mitigate excessive volatility in themarket. The rupee, which had been depreciating at ahigher rate of around 5 per cent against the US dollarby October, reversed its depreciating trend with theinflow of proceeds from the international bond issue inOctober. The appreciating trend was furtherstrengthened with the announcement of an increasein foreign ownership of Treasury bonds in December2007 from up to 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the totaloutstanding Treasury bonds, and the weakening of theUS dollar against major currencies. As a result, by end2007 the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollarmoderated to around 0.93 per cent as compared to a

The tourism industry has emerged as one of the largest

and fastest growing industries in the world. With increasesin income and the liberalization of travel restrictions, people

tend to move from country to country, generating newincome and employment opportunities in the host countries.

The year 2007 exceeded expectations for internationaltourism with arrivals reaching new record figures close to

900 million1. Tourism generates income through

consumption of goods and services by tourists and createsopportunities for employment in service industries such as

transportation, hotel accommodation and entertainment. Inparticular, tourism has become one of the leading ways for

developing countries to increase their participation in theglobal economy.

Sri Lanka’s tourism potential has not yet been fully

exploited. Although Singapore lacks the richness of

Tourism Industry: Realising its Potential

resources that Sri Lanka is endowed with, Singapore has

attracted 10.5 million visitors in 20072. In India, the tourismindustry has seen a phenomenal growth between 2002 and

2007 and earnings from tourism have increased at the highrate of 33.8 per cent to US dollars 11,956 million in 20073.

In recent years, the Maldives has been successful in

marketing natural assets such as unpolluted beaches onsmall coral islands, diving in blue waters abundant with

tropical fish and glorious sunsets. Tourism now brings inabout US dollars 450 million a year to the Maldives.

Although tourism is the fourth largest foreign exchangeearner of Sri Lanka, it still earns only around US dollars

400 million per year. Sri Lanka’s rich cultural heritage,

diverse landscape and a number of wildlife reserves presenta wide range of opportunities for prospective tourists. But,

expectations of a sharper depreciation of the rupee byforeign exchange earners and foreign exchangedealers. However, during the last quarter of 2007, thelevel of activity in the foreign exchange market pickedup substantially with the successful completion of thedebut international bond issue and the resultantreversal in the depreciating trend. Foreign exchangeforward market transactions followed a declining trendwith respect to the level of activity in the foreignexchange market during first three quarters andregained momentum in the fourth quarter of 2007.

The Central Bank participated in the domesticforeign exchange market throughout 2007, tosmoothen out excessive volatility in the foreignexchange market and to build up official reserves.During the year, the Central Bank intervened on bothsides of the market, which helped prevent erraticmovements in the exchange rates. The Central Bankabsorbed a total of US dollars 593 million from theinter-bank market and supplied US dollars 716 millionduring 2007, resulting in a net supply of US dollars123 million in 2007 as compared to a net supply of USdollars 484 million in 2006. The impact of theappreciation of the currency needs to be mitigatedthrough productivity improvements by export andimport competing industries. Increasing commodityprices in international markets however, partly offsetsthe impact of the appreciation of the currency.

Foreign exchange market activities inderivative instruments gained momentum in 2007.Apart from the conservative buying and selling in theforeign exchange spot and forward markets, Sri Lankarupee based foreign exchange options gained marketpreference in 2007. To hedge against the volatility inimport prices of oil, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation(CPC) commenced hedging a part of its oil purchasesby entering into two hedging agreements to importdiesel in February 2007 using the Zero Cost Collarmechanism and continued to hedge based on marketdevelopments there onwards. Through the hedgingmechanism the CPC was able to save Rs. 209 millionin 2007.

hotels) is around US dollars 100-150 in Sri Lanka, whereasthat rate is around US dollars 600-800 in the Maldives and

India. The Tourism industry has the potential to expand anddevelop by diversifying and promoting Sri Lanka in

especially emerging market economies, such as India andChina. India has been the top contributor in Sri Lanka’s

tourism earnings from 2005. The Middle East is also a

potentially significant tourism generating market for SriLanka. Promoting Sri Lanka as a tourist destination in

accordance with a well prepared strategic marketing plantargeting these markets will pay ample dividends in the

medium to long run.

The above facts clearly indicate that Sri Lanka has a

huge potential in this industry. Successive governments have

recognized the potential and offered various incentives topromote the industry. In 2007, the government granted a

range of concessions and incentives to promote tourism. InJuly 2007, the Ministry of Finance announced a temporary

relief package for the Tourism Industry, which included

postponing the implementation of the US dollars 10 visafee imposed by the budget 2006 till the end of 2007,

categorizing hotels and other classified entities within a‘lower tariff’ category by the Ceylon Electricity Board, a

moratorium on capital payments on loans provided totsunami affected hotels, a temporary deferment of VAT

payable on ‘tourism operations’ for a period of one year

and the suspension of penalty on delayed VAT paymentsuntil end-March 2008.

A significant development in the industry in 2007 wasthe implementation of the Tourism Act No. 38 of 2005,

which came into effect from 1st October 2007. With the

promulgation of the new Tourism Act, the Sri Lanka TouristBoard Act No. 20 of 1966 that prevailed during the past 41

years was repealed. The resultant administrative

decentralization enabled the creation of four statutory bodies,which are to work independently: Sri Lanka Tourism

Development Authority, Sri Lanka Tourism PromotionBureau, Sri Lanka Convention Bureau and the Sri Lanka

Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management4. These new

bodies will undertake development, planning, settingstandards, marketing and promotion, as well as development

of human resources in relation to tourism. The most laudablefeature in the setting up of these administrative structures is

that it avails equal opportunities to large, medium and smallscale business operators to develop a healthy partnership with

the government sector in all aspects of promoting tourism. It

is expected that the new Tourism Act will lead to a moreeffective public-private partnership in the management and

control of the tourism industry.

While recognising the fact that adverse publicity and

security related issues have resulted in low tourist arrivals,there are several aspects of the industry, which are yet to

receive sufficient attention and concerted efforts. Although

“sun and beach tourism” remains the main attraction for mostforeign visitors, alternative tourism such as eco , watersports

and adventure , historical, ayurveda , cruise and golf tourism,which have great potential have been promoted only on a

small scale. With the international growth of tourism, ecotourism has become increasingly popular. Sri Lanka is an

ideal destination for eco tourism, given the many activities

that tourists could engage in such as hiking, cycling, birdwatching, photography and wildlife safaris. Further, given

the scenic and varied landscape, adventure tourism also haspotential in Sri Lanka. Today, in India, ayurveda tourism is

fast becoming a new dimension in the health tourism niche

market. Sri Lanka also has the potential to enhance itsayurveda tourism market and make it an integral part of our

‘tourism profile’. “Sun and beach tourism”, meanwhile, couldbe further expanded by developing unexploited beaches in

the East and some of the other beaches of the country.

One of the biggest challenges that tourism is facing is

retaining tour operator confidence in Sri Lanka and preventing4 Tourism Act No. 38 of 2005.

Box 13a diversion of traffic elsewhere from Sri Lanka. For this

purpose, more aggressive marketing programmes andadvertising campaigns need to be launched internationally.

Active participation at global travel fairs will also helpincrease the confidence of tour operators and the world

community in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, steps should be takento develop tourism infrastructure such as hotel and other

accommodation facilities, banking facilities and

transportation facilities up to international standards, inorder to promote tourism. Tourism is sometimes associated

with exploitation of human beings and it is imperative totake all possible steps to prevent such exploitation.

There is a belief that involving the private sector intourism depends on incentives and subsidies given by the

government. The role of the government has been one of

facilitating, regulating and monitoring, planning, andintegrating such planning in relation to tourism into the

overall economic and social planning framework. ThoughSri Lanka’s tourism industry has to overcome many

challenges, the industry should have the ability to develop

without much government involvement. A good example in

this respect has been provided by Sri Lanka’s textile andgarment industry, which developed on its own strength,

meeting the market’s requirements.

The newly liberated Eastern Province with its beautifulbeaches, shallow seas and other natural endowments greatly

enhances the country’s potential in tourism. The privatesector, perhaps with foreign collaboration, should be

encouraged to tap this resource base early.

Sri Lanka has a long-standing reputation as a popular

tourist destination in the world. If properly planned and

managed, tourism can be highly profitable and couldcontribute to enhancing the quality of life of the local people

with minimal negative social and environmental impacts. Aspart of the promotional drive, the industry should also attempt

to manage perceptions and adverse publicity on Sri Lankathrough its agents and contacts abroad. The industry has the

potential to become a billion dollar industry soon, but that

would happen only, if all stakeholders rise to the challenge.
