FINANCIAL SECTORDEVELOPMENTS ANDSYSTEM STABILITY

Chapter 8

8.1 Overview

he financial sector continued to growstrongly and the financial systemremained resilient in the face of externalshocks and challenging domestic macroeconomicconditions. The main financial institutions maintainedtheir financial soundness through continuedprofitability, stronger capitalisation, improved assetquality and enhanced risk management, whichconsolidated their capacity to deal with the testingenvironment. The regulation and supervision of thefinancial system was further strengthened with theimplementation of several new prudential directivesand measures, while the systemically importantpayment and settlement systems operated with highavailability and safety. Hence, the near-term risks tothe financial system seem to be manageable and theoutlook for financial system stability is positive, withpolicies and measures being implemented to mitigaterisks and address vulnerabilities.

The financial services industry supported thecontinued expansion in economic activity. Theactivities of all major categories of financial institutions,such as banks, finance and leasing companies,insurance companies, pension and provident funds,primary dealers, rural banks and micro-financeinstitutions and other financial institutions, expandedduring the year. The banking sector experienced solidgrowth, with increases in the asset base, loans andadvances portfolio, investments and depositmobilisation. Bank lending growth was more moderatethan in the previous year, influenced by higher interestrates and the tight monetary policy stance. The bankingsector sustained its profitability and capital adequacylevels in 2007. The array of financial products andservices and delivery channels broadened with theintroduction of new schemes and Information andCommunication Technology (ICT) based products andservices, such as internet and mobile phone banking.There was a significant shift towards card-based

payment modes and automated teller machine (ATM)facilities. The finance and leasing companiesexpanded their branch network, although the financialfacilities extended grew at a slower pace than in theprevious year. A notable feature was the markedincrease in hire-purchase (HP) facilities in comparisonwith finance leasing facilities, taking advantage of atax benefit. The profitability of this sector declinedslightly due to an increase in the cost of funds and adecline in interest margins in the higher interest rateenvironment. The increased capitalisation of this sectorwill help cushion it against such stresses. Theinsurance sector experienced a steady growth, withboth life and general insurance business recordingappreciable progress. The capital levels of the industryhave improved with application of solvencyrequirements for the general insurance, while itsprofitability has been maintained. The assets andinvestment portfolios of the main superannuationfunds, the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and theEmployees’ Trust Fund (ETF), increased, with a risein their membership. The unit trust sector experienceda growth due to the establishment of a new closed-ended income fund during the year. Access to financewas further enhanced with financial institutions offeringnew and increased facilities to the agriculture sectorand small and medium enterprises sector.

The supervisory and regulatory frameworkgoverning the financial sector was furtherstrengthened with several directives and measuresintroduced to improve soundness of both banksand non-bank financial institutions. There was alsoa shift from compliance-based supervision towardsrisk-based supervision. The preparatory work for theimplementation of the Basel II Capital AdequacyFramework for banks from 2008, was completed. Theadoption of Basel II is expected to improve thesoundness and risk management of banks by betteraligning the bank's capital with its risk profile and byproviding more comprehensive capital coverage forcredit, market and operational risks. A direction oncorporate governance for banks was issued by theCentral Bank and a mandatory code for companieslisted on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) by theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Regulations on card-based payment instruments werealso issued and a direction setting out the prudentialrequirements of such service providers has beendrafted and will be issued shortly. To strengthen theanti-money laundering (AML) regime, guidelines wereissued to financial institutions on "know your customer"(KYC) and customer due diligence procedures.

Proposals to diversify the activities of primary dealers,subject to appropriate regulatory and prudentialsafeguards, were approved in 2007.

The legal framework supporting the financialsystem was reinforced and updated. The FinanceLeasing Act was amended to enable specialisedleasing companies to raise funds from the publicthrough the issue of debt securities, in order to broadentheir sources of funding. In addition, revisions to theFinance Companies Act to strengthen the CentralBank's regulatory and investigative powers withrespect to finance companies were drafted. A new lawto regulate and supervise Micro-Finance Institutions(MFIs) has also been prepared. A new securitisationlaw has been drafted to enable the issuance of asset-backed securities through bankruptcy remote specialpurpose vehicles and for the regulation of structuredfinance products.The Securities and ExchangeCommission Act is being amended to bring financialderivatives under its ambit. The Regulation ofInsurance Industry Act is also being amended tostrengthen prudential supervision and to permit theappointment of banks and other financial institutionsas agents for the distribution of insurance products.The Credit Information Bureau Act is being revised toextend the scope of its services to more diverse usergroups and to provide value added services. Therewas much emphasis on business continuity planning(BCP) to improve the resilience of the payments andsettlement system and financial system stability.

8.2 Financial System Stability

The financial system, supported by thesustained expansion of the financial servicessector, remained resilient and stable in 2007,despite increased pressures from external anddomestic macroeconomic and financial marketdevelopments. The main financial institutionsmaintained their soundness through strong profitability,increased capital levels and improved asset qualitywithin an enhanced regulatory and supervisoryframework, which has strengthened their resilienceand risk absorption capacity. Although the outlook forfinancial system stability remains positive, theprevailing downside risks such as high interest ratesassociated with high inflation, high credit growth andslowdown in global economy require continuedvigilance and risk mitigation to prevent the occurrenceof events that could have an adverse impact.

The turbulence in global financial markets sincemid-2007 has increased liquidity, credit and marketrisk in these markets. The turmoil, which wastriggered by the US sub-prime housing mortgage

problems, resulted in tighter credit conditions andhigher risk premiums in international financial markets.Sri Lanka has not been directly affected by the recentbouts of volatility, as local financial institutions did nothave exposure to the asset backed securities andderivatives.

On the domestic front, robust economic growthcontinues to underpin financial system stability.The growth of the financial services sector, which stoodat 8.5 per cent in 2007 was an important driver of thegrowth momentum. However, sharply rising interestrates in response to tight monetary policy measures,exerted challenges to financial stability. Financialsector institutions need to be more vigilant of suchrisks and appropriate risk mitigating measures shouldbe intensified in order to maintain the financial systemstability. High inflation and interest rates increasedmacro-prudential vulnerability by affecting the debtservicing capacity of the business and household

sectors. The rising public debt service obligationsexerted an upward pressure on interest rates in 2007and, hence, a prudent debt management strategy hasbeen implemented to address these concerns andthe results of the strategy were already seen in morestable interest rates at the beginning of 2008.

The debut international bond issue by thegovernment in the global financial markets hashelped to extend the maturity profile of foreignborrowings and build up foreign reserves. In thepast few years, there has been an increase in short-term foreign currency borrowings by the governmentwhich has increased the country's foreign exchangerisk exposure and weakened its foreign exchangeliquidity ratio. Hence, the mobilisation of foreign fundsthrough a 5-year bond has had a positive impact onthe external debt maturity structure and the country'sforeign reserve position. The sale of Treasury bondsto foreigners also helped strengthen external reserves.

Credit growth has been decelerating inresponse to policy measures, although it washigher than the targeted level. This is beneficial formaintaining financial system stability, as it will dampeninflationary pressures and reduce the likelihood of anincrease in credit risk in banks. In addition to tighteningmonetary policy, the Central Bank introduced severalprudential requirements with effect from the fourthquarter of 2006 to curtail excessive bank lending andto mitigate the risks associated with increased lending.These measures include the imposition of generalprovisioning on all performing advances and theincrease in risk weights in respect of loans securedby primary mortgages over residential properties andother loans and advances.

Domestic financial markets were more volatileduring the year. The money market rates experiencedintermittent periods of volatility, mainly due to weakmanagement of liquidity by some banks and the tightmonetary policy pursued by the Central Bank. Yieldson government securities in both the primary andsecondary markets increased following the increasein the Central Bank policy rates in February 2007. Inthe higher interest rate environment, investors showeda strong preference for short-term maturities (Treasurybills) and the market for medium-term Treasury bondswas relatively inactive. The foreign exchange marketcame under pressure during the year, due to thesettlement of large petroleum import bills, but stabilisedfollowing the sale of Treasury bonds to foreigners andthe international bond issue. The rupee, whichdepreciated against major currencies in the first threequarters, appreciated in the fourth quarter of 2007 andremained stable. The external reserve position

The Sub-Prime Crisis

The term ‘sub-prime’ refers to a low credit-worthinessof the borrower. Borrowers who have problems with theircredit history or are unable to prove that they have enoughincome to support the monthly payment on the loan forwhich they are applying are called subprime borrowers.Compared to prime loans, sub-prime loans or mortgagesare risky for both creditors and debtors, because of thecombination of high interest rates, bad credit history, andmurky personal financial situations, which are oftenassociated with such borrowers.

Due to several factors, the sub-prime mortgage marketsaw a rapid expansion in the last few years reaching closeto US dollars 2 trillion by 2007. Rising interest rates inthe US led to the bursting of the housing bubble in thatcountry and consequential high default rates on sub-primemortgages. Once housing prices started to drop moderatelyin 2006-2007 in many parts of the US, refinancing becamerather difficult. The default of loans and foreclosure activityincreased dramatically as interest rates of adjustable ratemortgages (ARM) were re-set higher. The increase indefault rates affected not only mortgage lenders thatretained credit risk, but also corporate and individualinvestors holding mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) orcollateralised debt obligations (CDOs). They facedsignificant losses as the value of the underlying mortgageassets declined. Stock markets in many countries also wereaffected significantly. Perhaps the most severe effect wasthat the widespread dispersion of credit risk and the unclearimpact on financial institutions caused lenders to reducelending activity or to demand higher interest rates forcredit, thus creating a liquidity and credit crunch. Thistightening of liquidity conditions spread to many developedmarkets and even led to run on a British bank,viz, NorthernRock. This liquidity concerns compelled central banks inmajor economies to inject liquidity to the market on a largescale to maintain market and financial system stability.

The Causes of the Crisis

A number of factors have together contributed to thesub-prime crisis1. The following is a summary of the maincauses to which the crisis is generally attributed.

a. Increasing delinquency rates in sub-prime mortgages:Delinquency rates on sub-prime mortgages started to pickup in the US as early as 2005 as higher interest rates and aslowdown of house price inflation made it more difficultfor some borrowers to meet their financial obligations. Thiswas particularly true for borrowers who had taken ARM

mortgages in which the interest payments increase overtime.

b. Intense competition among lenders and low qualitylending : This led to an undue relaxation of credit standardsand excessive risk taking by some lenders. There wereincentives for increasing quantity rather than quality, sincethe lenders repacked and sold mortgages, thus removingcredit risk from their balance sheets, and fee incomederived from this operation depended on the volume ofcredit granted. Furthermore, the prolonged period of lowinterest rates, high liquidity and low volatility, whichpreceded the current crisis led to financial institutionsunderestimating risks, a breakdown of credit and riskmanagement practices in many financial institutions, andshortcomings in financial regulation and supervision.

c. Off - balance-sheet-exposure of banks : Many bankshad set up structured investment vehicles to undertakestructuring of their asset securitisation and creditderivative business through off-balance-sheettransactions. Banks began to face sudden liquidityproblems when the demand for liquidity from thesestructured investment vehicles, which had credit linearrangements with banks increased. This led to adevelopment of a liquidity crunch in the market.

d. Rapid development of complex financial productsthrough asset securitisation outside the regulated entities:The dramatic increase in securitisation activity hasmodified the functioning of credit markets by reducingthe fundamental role of liquidity transformation performedby financial intermediaries. Thus, the role of banks andother mortgage firms changed from “originate and hold”to “originate , repackage and sell” through securitisation.This enabled them to distribute credit, market and liquidityrisks associated with lending activities and securitisedassets to those who are more willing to hold them. Thesecredit derivatives, based on mortgages and other types ofloans were complex and very few understood theirvaluations. Furthermore, the distribution of credit riskamong investors created uncertainty as to who actuallyheld the risks.

e. Lapses of credit rating agencies : Rating agencies havenot updated their ratings of MBSs, CDOs and other creditderivatives in line with the changes in the risk profile ofthe underlying assets, particularly sub-prime mortgages.Hence, investors were unable to differentiate between sub-prime backed credit derivatives and other good qualityasset backed credit derivatives. Consequently the panicked

demand for redemption of investments by investors affectedall classes of credit derivatives, aggravating the crisis.f.Lack of transparency in the OTC markets: Unlikepublicly traded securities and futures contracts, thesecollateralised debt obligations and credit derivatives are nottraded on exchanges. Instead, they trade in over-the-counter(OTC) markets. In an exchange, the exchange acts as thecounterparty for every sale and purchase and the trades aredone in a transparent manner. However, in OTC markets,trading is bilateral between customers and dealers, andprices and volumes of trades are not disclosed. The pricediscovery process is not transparent, and there is nosurveillance of the market to identify where there are largeor vulnerable positions. Moreover, unlike exchanges, theseOTC markets have no designated or otherwiseinstitutionalised market makers or dealers to ensureliquidity. As a result, when major events send prices reeling,dealers stop acting as market makers and trading can stopabruptly.Lessons to be Learned from the Crisis

The crisis has highlighted some of the weaknesses inmarkets, financial institutions and regulatory framework.Some of the main lessons that could be learnt are:•Importance of liquidity : The crisis underlined thecritical importance of liquidity in managing and regulatingbanks. Unlike other financial institutions, banks arevulnerable to bank runs and panics, since their liabilitiesare subject to withdrawal on demand. Although liquidityrisks are inherent in the maturity transformation servicesoffered by banks, banks need to pay close attention toliquidity demand arising both from on-balance-sheetmaturity mismatches and off- balance-sheet exposures.Therefore, adequacy of liquidity has to be given as muchimportance as capital adequacy in maintaining thesoundness of banks. Capital adequacy, which indicatessolvency, alone would not be a sufficient condition forsurvival in a stressed situation. The importance of lookingat “cash flows” as a loan criteria re-emerged following thecrisis.•The need for stress testing under extreme scenarios:Hidden and unexpected risks cannot be seen under normalfinancial market conditions. Risks assumed to bemanageable become extreme under crisis or stressedsituations.

•Model risks: Pricing of complex credit derivativescreated through securitisation were based on valuation

models, which functioned under certain assumptions.When the assumptions in-built in such models no longerhold, it becomes difficult to price such products, leadingto stoppage of a market. Therefore, in the current financialenvironment where sophisticated models are used in manyareas such as credit risk modelling, valuation etc.,identification of models as a source of risk is essential. Inorder to mitigate model risks measures, such as awarenessbuilding, evaluation of and understanding of assumptions,use of simple models and back testing and stress testingare essential.•Enhancing transparency in markets and institutions:Supervisory and regulatory frameworks need to be updatedin line with new developments and financial innovations.This applies to both crisis prevention frameworks and crisisresolution frameworks. In USA some mortgage originatorswere unregulated entities and were not subject toappropriate disclosure and consumer protectionrequirements. Supervisors and regulators in other countrieshave to ask whether their frameworks are adequate, forinstance, the opacity in the hedge fund activities and inthe OTC market also point to the need for transparencyand improved disclosures.•Adverse incentives : The recent developmentsilluminated the adverse incentives that had been allowedto develop in the distribution chain for credit products,including the strong incentives for originators to putquantity above quality, for the rating agencies to expandtheir scope as widely as possible, and for banks to use off-balance-sheet vehicles to finance structured credits. It mayalso reveal some flaws in compensation schemes in banks.In some cases these incentives arose despite regulation; inothers they were the consequence of faults in the regulatorysystem.•Pro-cyclicality of risk : The crisis showed again howmeasures of risk used by companies and regulators can bepro-cyclical, encouraging more risk taking at the top ofthe cycle and potentially exacerbating the downswing.

The sub-prime led financial turmoil has taught andcontinues to teach many lessons to regulators, investors,financial institutions and markets. A common line runningacross many of the causes of the crisis and the lessons thatit brought up is the importance of transparency anddisclosures relating to financial markets and institutionsand the importance of integrated risk management fororganisations.

improved, thereby strengthening financial systemstability. The equity market was on a downward trendfor most of the year and the price indices declined in2007 for the first time since 2000. A number of factorscontributed to this development, such as the risingdomestic interest rates, forecasts of a moderation incompany earnings, heightened security concerns andissues relating to the structure and the size of the sharemarket.

The banking sector maintained its profitability,soundness and resilience in 2007. The profitabilityof Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), as indicatedby the return on assets (ROA) and return on equity(ROE) ratios was sustained at a high level, as thesebanks were able to maintain their net interest marginsby effectively re-pricing deposit and loan rates. Theprofitability of Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs)however, declined slightly due to a narrowing of netinterest margins. The capital funds of banks haveincreased and the capital adequacy ratios of thebanking sector exceeded both the local andinternational regulatory minimum levels, therebyproviding a buffer that will contribute to shielding theindustry from shocks and disturbances. The overallresilience of the banking sector is expected to increasewith the improved risk management and enhancedcapital requirements that would come into effect withthe adoption of Basel II in 2008.

Bank risk exposures were at manageable levels.The asset quality of banks, which has improvedsignificantly over the past few years due to better riskmanagement techniques, loan recovery proceduresand more stringent prudential requirements, is beingmaintained with a decline in the non-performing loan(NPL) ratio for the banking system in 2007. Theprovisioning levels have also increased, indicatinggreater resilience. However, the rapid expansion inbank credit in the last three years and the rise ininterest rates in 2007 have resulted in a slight increasein credit risk, as indicated by the rise in the volume ofnon-performing loans. Hence, banks should maintainhigh credit standards to avoid adverse developmentsin this area. The sectoral distribution of bank credit isfairly broad-based. However, the rapid increase in banklending to the consumption and housing, constructionand property development sectors, warrants someattention, as these sectors can be especiallyvulnerable to credit risks. In particular, lending on creditcards has to be monitored closely as delinquenciesare above the NPL ratio average. The LCBs were ableto manage market risk (both interest rate and foreignexchange risk) adequately. The loan to deposit ratioof the banking sector has been rising and banks'

exposure to liquidity risk has increased in 2007. Thereliance of a few banks on the money market to financetheir funding gaps may pose risks, if maturitymismatches increase and market liquidity becomestight. Hence, banks need to improve their asset liabilitymanagement to mitigate this risk. In addition, theimplementation of an integrated risk managementframework is imperative for the proper managementof risk in the future.

Registered finance companies (RFCs) andspecialised leasing companies experienced anincreased exposure to interest rate risk in 2007.This sector accounts for 5.5 per cent of total financialassets and caters to the important category of smalland medium enterprises that do not have easy accessto bank finance. In the higher interest rate environmentthat prevailed in 2007, finance and leasing companiesbecame more vulnerable to interest rate risk. Theprofitability of finance and leasing companies hasbecome constrained due to the contraction in interestmargins, as funding becomes more expensive in thehigher interest rate environment. These companies arepredominantly engaged in the leasing financebusiness, which are typically medium-term contractsat fixed interest rates. Finance companies have tomobilise funds at higher rates than banks and thereforehave to charge higher interest rates from theircustomers, hence they have a higher risk profile thanbanks. In addition, leasing companies are largelydependent on banks for their funding requirement andbanks are also their competitors in the leasingbusiness. However, the recently strengthened capitalpositions and provisioning policies of these companieswill provide a financial buffer to withstand thesestresses.

The risk levels of the two largestsuperannuation funds - the EPF and the ETF,remained low. As the majority of the EPF and ETFinvestment portfolio is held in the form of default riskfree government securities, the credit risk is negligible.The funds were also not vulnerable to liquidity risk,due to the positive inflows of funds through membercontributions and investments in Treasury bills. Themain risk that the EPF and ETF are exposed to isinterest rate risk due to the high concentration ofinvestments in fixed income securities. However, thisrisk is to a large extent mitigated, as the bulk of theseassets are held in investment accounts that do notrequire "marking to market." The other approvedprivate pension and provident funds also have a riskprofile similar to that of the major funds.

The soundness of insurance companies isbeing strengthened with the introduction of newprudential standards and a risk based supervisoryframework. Solvency rules for general insurancebusiness came into effect from May 2007, whilesolvency rules for life insurance were introduced someyears ago. The majority of companies were compliantwith the solvency margin requirements. The InsuranceBoard of Sri Lanka (IBSL) has commenced risk-basedsupervision, in terms of the CARAMELS1 ratingsystem. The capital levels of insurance companiesincreased during the year. In addition, the minimumequity capital for insurance companies will beincreased to Rs. 250 million for each line of insurancebusiness in 2008, which may lead to industryconsolidation. The proposed amendments to theinsurance law will provide the IBSL with increasedpowers to supervise the insurance industry effectivelyand should be implemented soon. The proposals alsoinclude the appointment of institutional agents, whichwould facilitate the entry of banks and other financialinstitutions into the insurance industry.

Improvements to the financial infrastructuresystems continued during the year, with businesscontinuity planning taking a centre stage. TheLankaSettle system operated by the Central Bank andthe Cheque Imaging and Truncation (CIT) systemoperated by LankaClear together settle 99 per cent ofall non-cash payments in the country. The LankaSettlesystem has been functioning without major interruptionand the system availability was very high at 99.8 percent in 2007. The CIT system experienced a minordisruption during the year, but that had no impact onfinancial system stability. Much progress was madewith respect to business continuity planning and theestablishment of fully functional disaster recovery sitesfor the systemically important payment and settlementsystems. All clearing systems settle their netobligations in the LankaSettle system, except the twoclearing systems operated by the CSE for equity anddebt securities. To further strengthen the stability ofthe payments and settlement system, it is desirablethat the net obligations of these two systems also beshifted to the LankaSettle system. The NationalPayments Council (NPC) is implementing its medium-term road map to modernise the financial infrastructurein keeping with the latest technological developmentswith a focus on improving the efficiency, security andrisk management. A priority will be to launch chip-based credit cards and to introduce a nation-wide nextday cheque clearing facility and an electronic fundstransfer system for banks and their customers.

The overall outlook for financial system stabilityremains favourable. The growth prospects of the SriLankan economy are expected to strengthen theperformance of the business sector and improve theprofitability of financial institutions. The continuationof policies to address the domestic macroeconomicimbalances is essential to stabilise domestic financialmarkets. Financial regulators and institutions will needto continue their vigilance and take proactivemeasures to promote the development, efficiency,soundness and stability of the financial system.

8.3 Developments in Financial Institutions

The activities of financial institutionscontinued to expand supporting the financialneeds of the economy. The total assets of financialinstitutions increased by 16 per cent and amountedto Rs.4,323.0 billion in 2007, which is 1.21 times theGDP. The licensed banking sector (LCBs and LSBs)accounted for 58 per cent of total financial institutionassets and continued to hold the dominant position inthe financial sector. The LCBs accounted for 48.6 percent of the total financial assets, while the LSBsaccounted for 9.4 per cent. The contractual savings

institution sector, led by the EPF accounted for 20.5per cent of financial sector assets. Finance and leasingcompanies accounted for 5.5 per cent, while theinsurance sector accounted for 3.1 per cent of thefinancial system. The Central Bank represented 13.0per cent of the assets of the financial sector.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Total assets of the Central Bank increased by14.0 per cent in 2007 with an increase in foreignassets and a decline in domestic assets. Theincrease in foreign assets was largely due to thepurchases of foreign currency proceeds received bythe government.

Domestic assets of the Central Bank declinedlargely due to the decline in Treasury bill holdings.During the year the Central Bank provided Rs.11.7billion of provisional advances to the government. This,together with the increase in net foreign assets of theCentral Bank by about Rs.63 billion largely due to thereceipts of the debut international bond issue of thegovernment, resulted in substantial excess liquidity inthe market. The government retired its Treasury billholdings with the Central Bank, worth of Rs.20 billion,using the bond proceeds and it helped to reduce partof excess liquidity in the market. Also, the Central Bankhad to sterilise the excess liquidity through outrightsales of the Bank's Treasury bill holdings. In addition,liquidity was absorbed through Open MarketOperations (OMOs) on a daily basis. Accordingly, theBank's Treasury bill holdings at end 2007 declined byRs.23.5 billion to Rs. 41.8 billion. This, and the increasein other liabilities caused the decline in Net DomesticAssets (NDA) of the Central Bank by Rs.38.5 billion.

On the liability side, the total currency issue ofthe Central Bank increased by 10.3 per cent(Rs.16.2 billion), compared with the 18.7 per cent(Rs.24.8 billion) growth in 2006. The deposits ofcommercial banks held with the Central Bank forstatutory reserve purposes increased only by 10.2 percent (Rs. 8.4 billion) reflecting a substantial moderationcompared with the 26.1 per cent growth in 2006. Thiswas mainly a result of relatively low growth in depositsattributed to the tight monetary policy stance of theCentral Bank.

The strength of the Central Bank's balancesheet improved further during 2007, with theincrease in its general reserves as a ratio of domesticassets, which is necessary to mitigate any unforeseenrisks in the future.

Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs)

Supported by continued economic expansion,the activities of LCBs improved further in 2007 asreflected by the growth of assets, expansion indistribution channels, improvement in riskmanagement, risk absorption capacity, andinnovations. There were 23 LCBs by end 2007,operating through a network of 1,934 branches, and2,269 other service outlets. Complementing thisnetwork, and reflecting the gradual shift towards card-based payment modes, there were 1,422 ATMs,12,214 electronic fund transfer facilities at the point ofsale (EFTPOS) machines, and 16 fully fledged Internetbanking portals. With the increase in per capita incomeand increased competition, the total number of activecredit cards increased from 811,289 at end 2006 to889,780 at end 2007. In the face of increasedcompetition, many banks introduced IT basedinnovative services such as banking through mobile

1. What is corporate governance?

Corporate governance involves a set of relationshipsbetween a company’s management, its Board, itsshareholders and other stakeholders. It also provides thestructure through which the objectives of the companyare set, and the means of attaining those objectives andmonitoring performance, are determined.1 Accordingly,the implementation of corporate governance principlesensures that companies are managed prudently and in atransparent way and that directors are held responsibleand accountable for the business operations of thecompanies.

2. The special need for corporate governance in banks

Corporate governance has attracted a good deal ofpublic interest because of its perceived importance forthe economic health of an organisation. It has gained ahigher level of importance following the massivecorporate scandals and failures in the early 2000s, whichrocked the business world, such as Enron and WorldCom.Subsequently, many organisations, regulators andsupervisors around the world have developed andimplemented a number of corporate governance codes.

It is generally accepted that banks unlike other firmshave a special significance in a modern economy for anumber of reasons. First, banks are the dominantcomponent of the financial system and failures of bankswill affect functions such as savings, investment andpayment services in a country, which are essential for thesmooth performance of an economy. Banking crises havebeen found to impose an enormous costs on an economyin terms of output cost and fiscal cost of restructuringfailed financial institutions. Second, the banking systemhas the ability to create money through its business andthis created money is the larger component of the moneysupply available for financing economic transactions.Therefore, failures of banks will adversely affect themonetary conditions and the economic well-being of thepublic.

There are two further related reasons why corporategovernance takes on an added significance in relation tobanks. First, there is a moral hazard issue with regard tooperation of banks, because banks deal with depositors’funds, i.e., banks use money that is primarily borrowedfrom depositors. The shareholders’ funds in a bank areminimal when compared to depositors’ funds, makingbanks highly leveraged organisations. However, theshareholders get high returns from banks for their minimal

investment. If a bank were to fail, it would result in a fargreater monetary loss to the depositors than to theshareholders. Therefore, it is vital that the interests of thedepositors are protected. In this context, the importanceof corporate governance in banks extends beyond the usualscope applicable to other companies, as the boards andmanagement of banks have a duty to take care of theinterest of the depositors who are non-shareholdingstakeholders of the banks.

Second, in a banking institution, public/customerconfidence is vital for the very existence of the business.The conduct of directors is an important aspect thatcontributes towards maintaining the confidence of thepublic in banks. Any loss of confidence in a bank maycause a run on that bank which would not only affect thatbank, but could have a ripple effect and affect other banksas well, leading to instability in the financial system.Therefore, the development of a code of conduct for thedirectors and the management is an important ingredienttowards protecting the economic health of banks and thefinancial system stability in general.

3. Directions on corporate governance for licensedbanks

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has a statutoryresponsibility to ensure price and economic stability andfinancial system stability. Hence, it uses the regulatoryand supervisory authority entrusted to it by the MonetaryLaw Act and Banking Act to ensure the soundness and thestability of the banking system, which is a prerequisite forthe financial system stability. Supervision focuses onpromoting and ensuring that banks have proper systems,controls and procedures for the prudent management ofrisks inherent in their business. However, the moral hazardproblem arising from the regulatory and supervisory roleof the Central Bank, i.e., the tendency of bank customersand bank managers to take more risks than would be takenin the absence of the Central Bank, needs to be managed.The Central Bank cannot be the risk manager of banks,because it cannot step into the shoes of bank managers toconduct the banking business. Therefore, the boards ofdirectors should have the primary responsibility andaccountability for risk management of banks morally andstatutorily because of the significance of the business ofbanks.

In this context, the Central Bank introduced a voluntarycode of corporate governance which was formulated by atask force appointed from the banking industry in June2002. In February 2006, the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision also issued an eight principles based system

l Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principlesof Corporate Governance.

phones to improve efficiency in accessing newmarkets and maintaining existing market shares.

The supervisory framework relating to LCBswas further strengthened with the introduction ofnew directions and a shift from compliance basedsupervision to risk based supervision during theyear. Several directions were issued during the yearcovering share ownership in banks, maximum amountof accommodation, corporate governance, Basel II andnew capital instruments. These prudential measuresare expected to improve soundness of banks throughenhanced risk management, reduced conflicts ofinterests and improved corporate governance in

banks. In preparation for the adoption of newregulations, the Central Bank together with the bankingindustry, took measures to improve capacity buildingin the banks.

Developments in the Structure of LCBs: Thegrowth of total assets decelerated to 17.5 per centcompared to 22.3 per cent recorded in 2006 mainlyon account of lower growth in loans and advancesin 2007 induced by tight monetary policy andenhanced prudential requirements. The total assetsstood at Rs. 2,100 billion at end 2007. Within thebanking sector, the domestic private banks recordedan 18.4 per cent growth of assets while the state owned

to enhance corporate governance for bankingorganizations. In view of the weaknesses inherent in avoluntary code and the global developments in corporategovernance, the Central Bank announced in its “RoadMap: Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2007and Beyond” issued in January 2007 that mandatorycorporate governance rules would be introduced in 2007.Accordingly, a draft code was issued in August 2007 tocanvass views of the public and the banking community.Based on the feedback received, a revised draft was issuedin November 2007 for further comments from the relevantparties. Incorporating views and suggestions received, aDirection on Corporate Governance was issued inDecember 2007, to be effective from January 2008.

These Directions have been developed on the basis ofthe fundamental principles of corporate governance. Themain aspects covered are the broad responsibilities of theboard of directors, board’s composition, criteria to assess

the fitness and propriety of directors, managementfunctions delegated by the board, separation of duties ofthe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, board appointedcommittees in relation to integrated risk management,audit, nomination, human resource and remuneration,related-party transactions and disclosure of financialstatements.

In Sri Lanka, since the banking institutions controlnearly 70 per cent of the financial system, it is importantthat the safety and soundness of these institutions aremaintained to ensure financial system stability. In thecircumstances, the Direction on Corporate Governance willensure common standards of behaviour amongst allbanking institutions, enhance public confidence andcontribute towards strengthening the stability of bankinginstitutions, thereby contributing towards maintainingfinancial system stability.

banks showed an asset growth of 15.2 per cent. Thecontribution of domestic private banks and state banksto the total growth in assets was 47 per cent and 35per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, assets of foreignbanks grew at a relatively higher rate of about 21.3per cent supported by the increase in capital funds.The loans and advances grew by 18.6 per cent in 2007as opposed to 27.6 per cent in 2006. As a result, thecontribution of loans and advances to the growth inassets declined from about 80 per cent in 2006 to 68per cent in 2007. The introduction of the provisioningon performing loans also helped to moderateexpansion in loans and advances.

Despite the deceleration, the still high growthin loans and advances was mainly driven byexpansion in the credit portfolios of state banksand domestic private banks. Total increase in loansand advances amounted to Rs. 214 billion in 2007compared to Rs. 249 billion recorded in 2006. Statebanks and domestic private banks contributed 40 percent and 45 per cent, respectively, to the overall growthof 18.6 per cent in loans and advances. However, interms of annual growth, foreign banks recorded thehighest growth rate in loans and advances of 21.3 percent, followed by domestic private banks with a growthrate of 18.6 per cent.

Widening of net interest margins in anenvironment of rising interest rates, theimprovement in operational efficiencies andrecovery of non performing loans enabled LCBsto record a robust growth in profits. Accordingly,profits before tax increased by 27 per cent to Rs.38billion in 2007 compared to 32 per cent growth in 2006.Domestic private banks contributed to 54 per cent ofthe growth in profit of the sector. The profitability interms of ROA and ROE improved over the previousyear and stood at 1.9 per cent and 16.0 per cent,respectively, at end 2007.

Sources and Uses of Funds of LCBs: Theincreasing trend of borrowing witnessed in 2006 as afunding source reversed in 2007 though borrowingsstill accounted for 17.7 per cent of total funding. Theshare of deposits in the total funding structureremained unchanged at about 69 per cent. Reflectinghigher disposable income of households and creditcreation, the total deposits grew by 17.4 per cent toRs.1,450 billion. On account of the higher opportunitycost of money in a rising interest rate environment,non-interest bearing rupee demand deposits declinedby 5 per cent while rupee fixed deposits and savingsdeposits grew at higher rates of 38 per cent and 7per cent, respectively, in 2007.The foreign currency

deposits, which grew by 20 per cent during the year,accounted for about 26 per cent of the deposit baseof the LCBs.

The share of capital funds in the total resourcebase recorded an increase from 7.3 per cent in 2006to 7.7 per cent in 2007. This was mainly due to theinfusion of fresh capital by banks through share issuesand retained profits. Meanwhile, the contribution fromdeposits, which is the largest funding source, remainedunchanged at 69 per cent. However, borrowingsdeclined from 19.0 per cent to 17.7 per cent betweenthe two periods.

Loans and overdrafts continued to absorb adominant share of resources mobilised during theyear. Increase in loans and overdrafts absorbedRs.214.1 billion, representing 68 per cent of the totalresources mobilised during the year. Meanwhile, theshare on investments was 16 per cent in 2007. Incomparison, loans and advances and investmentcontributed about 65 per cent and 14 per cent to thetotal utilisation of funds in 2007.

According to the purpose-wise distribution ofprivate sector credit, credit granted for trading,housing and consumption purposes continued toaccount for a dominant share. The share of creditfor trading activities including domestic andinternational trade increased to 30.6 per cent by end2007. Meanwhile, the share of credit absorbed byhousing and construction decreased to 16.6 per centwhile that of consumption activities increased to 20.6per cent by end 2007. In the consumption category,loans granted for purchase of consumer goodsaccounted for the bulk of the increase while in the creditfor housing activities, the residential housing sectorcontributed to the largest share. Trading, housing andconsumption activities accounted for about 68 per centof the total credit outstanding.

Reflecting the impact of the tight monetarypolicy stance and higher non-performinmg ratios,the growth in credit card business decelerated in2007. Credit provided through credit cards by 10banks increased by 37 per cent to Rs. 29 billion incomparison to 41 per cent growth recorded in 2006.The share of credit card loans in the total loan portfolioof LCBs increased marginally from 1.7 per cent to 2.1per cent in 2007 due to loans and advances growingat a relatively lower rate. Due to the unsecured natureof such lending, an interest rate in the range of 38-40per cent was being charged on credit card loans.

The overall exposure of commercial banks tothe public sector increased as a result of anincreased utilisation of bank credit by both thegovernment and public corporations.

Key Performance Indicators: The main financialsoundness indicators of LCBs improved providinggreater risk absorption capacity. Profitability in termsof ROA and ROE improved mainly due to increases innet interest margin and operational cost efficiencies.Reflecting an improvement in cost efficiencies in theLCB sector, the operating cost ratio improved to 56.4per cent in 2007 from 59 per cent in 2006. The capitaladequacy ratio stood at about 13.0 per cent relativeto the minimum requirement of 10 per cent. Creditquality of LCBs improved as reflected in the decline inNPLs from 5.5 per cent at end 2006 to 4.9 per cent atend 2007. This improvement was a net result of anexpansion in lending portfolios, strong recoveries andsome banks writing off bad debts. Providing a greatercushion for absorption of credit losses, provisioncoverage available for NPLs increased to 74 per centin 2007. The net NPL to capital ratio declined from13.0 per cent in 2006 to 10.5 per cent at end 2007due to relatively faster growth in capital. The liquidasset ratio stood at 24.8 per cent as against theminimum requirement of 20 per cent.

Improving the efficiency of the State Banks :Implementation of the strategic plans formulatedby the state banks under the guidance of theStrategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA)to improve the efficiency, made progress in 2007.Improvements were recorded in the areas of branchautomation, capital adequacy, managementinformation systems, loan recoveries and humanresource development during the year. The capitaladequacy ratio, NPL ratio and provision coverage ratioimproved providing greater resilience.

Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs)

Despite lower profits, LSBs remained resilientin terms of main prudential indicators. Total assetsgrew by 14.4 per cent, while profit before tax declinedby 1.4 per cent to Rs.6.1 billion in 2007. The capitaladequacy ratio stood at 19.4 per cent compared tothe minimum requirement of 10 per cent. Total depositsand borrowings increased by 11.5 per cent and 22 percent, respectively. The total number of LSBs increasedto 15 by end 2007 with the entry of Sri Lanka SavingsBank, which took over the business operations ofPramuka Savings and Development Bank whosemanagement affairs was vested with the Director ofBank Supervision of the Central Bank following thesuspension of its business in October 2002. Thebranch network of LSBs increased to 402 at end 2007.

The housing, industrial and financial sectorscontinued to absorb a dominant share of the loansof LSBs. Of the loans approved during the year,Rs.45.6 billion or 67 per cent was accounted for bythese three sectors. Due to the existence of bankscatering mainly to the housing sector, a substantialportion of the lending of LSBs is concentrated in thehousing sector. Despite a decrease, investmentsmainly in the form of government securities stillaccounted for about 50 per cent of the total assets incomparison to the 17 per cent share in LCBs. Thetotal outstanding loans and deposits of LSBs at end2007 were Rs. 166 billion and Rs. 286 billion,respectively.

Registered Finance Companies (RFCs)

RFCs expanded further during 2007 althoughat a slower pace than in 2006. Total assets of RFCsgrew by 31 per cent to Rs. 142 billion. An expansionin financial accommodations, in particular leasing andhire purchase facilities, which represent 50 per centof total assets of RFCs, largely contributed to thegrowth. The deposit liabilities of RFCs accounted for4.2 per cent of the total deposit liabilities of majordeposit-taking institutions regulated by the CentralBank as at end 2007.

Credit granted by RFCs grew by 33 per cent in2007. Leasing facilities, which accounted for 33 percent of total credit, recorded a lower growth rate of 16per cent while hire purchase facilities, which accountfor 33 per cent of total credit, recorded a growth of 40per cent. The imposition of a ceiling on the claimableinput Value Added Tax (VAT) led the RFCs to focusmore on hire purchase facilities where rentals are notsubject to VAT. Loans granted for real estate activitiesaccounted for 9 per cent of total credit in 2007. Facilitiesunder pawning showed a 58 per cent growth toincrease its share of total assets to 3 per cent.

Deposits accounted for 55 per cent of totalresources of RFCs and continued to be the majorfunding source. Total deposit liabilities increased by33 per cent during 2007. The other two major fundingsources, bank borrowings and capital funds, accountedfor 14 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively of totalresources.

The profitability of the RFCs declined in 2007.When compared to the previous year, before tax netprofit of RFCs decreased by 5 per cent. During 2007interest income increased by 43 per cent while interestexpenses increased by 59 per cent. As a result, netinterest income rose only by 20 per cent. Although theproportion of operating expenses, including provisionsfor bad and doubtful debts, to total expensesdecreased from 43 per cent recorded in 2006 to 40per cent in 2007, net profit before tax of Rs. 2.7 billionreported for the period ended 31 December 2006 haddecreased to Rs. 2.6 billion for the period ended 31December 2007. This can be attributed to the fact thatthe lending rates of RFCs did not adjust as swiftly astheir cost of funds to the rise in interest rates in theeconomy during 2007.

increased markedly during the year. The PDs engagedin significant portfolio restructuring, reflecting investorpreference towards shorter maturities in the increasinginterest rate environment experienced in thegovernment securities market. Net profit before tax ofthe industry rose by 86 per cent to Rs. 1 billion in 2007.Consequently, the ROE increased to 18.4 per cent in2007 from 11.2 per cent in 2006. The risk weightedcapital adequacy ratio for the PD industry was 35 percent in 2007, which was far above the minimumregulatory requirement of 8 per cent.

PDs need to diversify activities to mitigate risk.PDs are currently exposed to business concentrationrisk as they engage exclusively in the governmentsecurities market. In terms of the diversificationproposals approved by the Central Bank, PDs will beable to increase the range of services offered, in twostages. Under the first stage, PDs will be allowed toengage in fee based services such as portfoliomanagement, project appraisal, loan syndicationservices, brokering in corporate bonds/debenturesboth quoted/unquoted and to invest in ordinary sharesor debentures of their own group of companies, subjectto some limits. In the second stage, which will beintroduced after six months from the implementationof stage one, PDs will be allowed to maintaininvestments in other quoted shares/debentures orbonds and commercial papers and they will be allowedto form mutual funds/unit trusts and invest in mutualfunds/unit trusts. Further, PDs will be allowed to carryout their activities by borrowing through debtinstruments. At present, the amendments to the lawsare being effected and the new business plan will belaunched in 2008. Initiatives are also being taken tolaunch a new online PD data reporting system to theCentral Bank, which is expected to be implemented inthe first half of 2008.

Stress tests, which assess the resilience of thePD portfolio to a change in interest rates, revealedthat there is no imminent threat to the stability ofthe PD system. The outcome of stress testing, whichmeasured the impact on the value of the portfolio andthe capital base of PDs of an upward movement ofinterest rates by 100 bps, indicated that the PDs wouldlose Rs. 171 million of their portfolio value or 2.85 percent of their capital base, as at end 2007.

Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs): At end2007, total assets of SLCs increased to Rs. 96 billionor by 23 per cent. Net profits increased by 17 percent, which was a deceleration compared with theprevious year. During the year three SLCs were

registered as RFCs while three new companies wereregistered as SLCs. Accordingly, at end 2007 the totalnumber of SLCs remained at 20 as in the previousyear. SLCs depend mainly on bank borrowings andas almost all the banks engage in the finance leasingbusiness, SLCs find it difficult to borrow from banks atcompetitive rates. This leads them to raise fundsthrough the issue of debt instruments. The CentralBank, taking into consideration the implications inmobilising funds from the public, issued a directionstipulating requirements to be fulfilled by SLCs inraising funds through the issues of debt instruments.

Unit Trusts: The unit trust industry expandeddue to the entry of a new close-ended income fundin 2007. The total assets of the unit trust industryincreased by 17 per cent to Rs. 6.3 billion in 2007.There were 5 institutions managing a total of 14 fundsin 2007. Of these funds, 6 were income funds, 4 weregrowth funds and 4 were balanced funds. Althoughequities were still the main instrument of investmentin unit trusts, the share declined to 65 per cent, whilethe share of private debt securities increased to 26per cent. The total number of unit holders declinedmarginally to 23,191 while the total number of units inissue increased to 470 million, indicating an increasein the concentration in ownership.

Merchant Banks: The operations of merchantbanks were sustained due to an increase in fund-based activities during the year. The asset base ofmerchant banks has increased by about 3 per cent in2007. Leasing, hire-purchase and lending activitieswere the main business lines during the year due tolimited opportunities in the equity market. There were9 merchant banks in operation in 2007.

the end of 2007, an increase of 16 per cent, and washeavily concentrated in government securities.

Insurance Companies

The insurance industry recorded solid growthin terms of premia and assets in 2007. The insurancesector accounts for about 3.1 per cent of the totalassets of the financial system. As insurance coverageis estimated to be less than 10 per cent of thepopulation, there is considerable scope for growth inthe industry. The insurance sector consists of 15companies, of which 11 firms are both life and generalinsurers, while 3 firms are general insurers and 1 firmis a life insurer. Five firms have collaborations withforeign insurance companies. The insurance industryis highly concentrated, with two firms accounting forabout 70 per cent of the total assets of the industrywhile the largest five firms accounting for 95 per centof total insurance assets. The total assets of insurancecompanies grew by 14 per cent in 2007. Generalinsurance premia rose by 23 per cent while lifeinsurance premia increased by 21 per cent during theyear. The overall profitability of the industry is expectedto be sustained at a level similar to the previous year.

Soundness of insurance companies improved.The solvency margin is the main indicator to measurethe soundness of insurance companies. New solvencymargin requirements for the general insurancebusiness came into effect in 2007. All insurancecompanies were compliant with the solvency marginrequirement for general insurance, except for twocompanies, which were marginally below therequirement. All life insurers met the solvency ratio.The capital levels of insurance companies alsoincreased during the year. Four insurance companieshave obtained ratings on their claim paying ability froma local rating agency in 2007.

The regulatory framework of the insurancesector is being strengthened. The insuranceregulator, the IIBSL has initiated action to conduct riskbased supervision of insurance companies based onthe CARAMELS rating system. To improve thefinancial strength and soundness of insurancecompanies and to promote the consolidation of theindustry, the IBSL also proposes to increase theminimum equity capital of insurance companies fromthe current level of Rs. 200 million to Rs. 250 millionfor each type of insurance business in 2008.

Amendments to the insurance law are beingfinalised. The legal framework relating to prudentialregulation and supervision will be upgraded with theproposed revisions of the Regulation of InsuranceIndustry Act. The powers of the IBSL with respect to

Venture Capital Companies (VCC):

The activities of VCC slackened during the year.The primary business of VCC is to provide equitycapital for high risk investments, mainly new ventureslaunched by entrepreneurs. The VCCs faced liquidityproblems due to higher provisions for bad debts, delaysin the recovery of returns and the lack of newinvestments. The higher rates in the governmentsecurities market also made investment in VCC lessattractive.

Theappointment of institutional agents will be introduced.The other important changes will be the requirementthat life and non-life companies be separatelyincorporated within a period of three years and thelisting of insurance companies on the stock exchangewithin a year.8.4 Developments in Financial Markets

Inter-bank Call Money Market

The daily average volume of inter-bank callmoney transactions, which was about Rs. 10 billionduring the fourth quarter of 2006, declined to aboutRs. 8 billion during the year 2007. This decline isidentified as being due to the liquidity surplus in thebanking system and the non-concentration of excessliquidity in a few banks, during the period.

On average, money market rates continued tobe stable at around 14-15 per cent during 2007.However, significantly larger movements wereobserved on the days when the market was short ofliquidity. The continuous reliance of a few banks onthe call market to fund their requirements was aconcern as it resulted in volatility in the money marketrates, particularly when the market was short ofliquidity. This could be a potential risk to the stability ofnot only these institutions but also the market as awhole, hence prudent liquidity management by theseinstitutions is required.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

Sri Lanka continued to follow a floating exchangerate regime during 2007. In order to smoothen outexcessive volatility in exchange rate, the Central Bankintervened in the foreign exchange market during theyear. The market was more stable in 2007 followingthe sales of Treasury bonds to foreign investors andthe inflow from the international bond issue of USdollars 500 million. The volumes in the inter-bankforeign exchange market decreased slightly during2007 to US dollars 9,275 million against US dollars10,792 million in 2006. The daily average volume ofinter-bank transactions in 2007 was US dollars 38million against US dollars 44 million in the previousyear.

Government Securities Market

Rupee Denominated Debt: The governmentcontinued to mobilise funds through rupeedenominated instruments, namely Treasury bonds,Treasury bills and Rupee Loans, to finance a part ofits budgetary requirements. Accordingly, through theauction system, the government issued Treasury billsamounting to Rs. 817 billion in gross face value terms,an increase of Rs.189 billion over 2006. Of the totalgross issues, 67 per cent had maturities less than orequal to 91 days. In net terms, there were new issuesworth Rs. 49 billion. In view of the rising interest rateenvironment and the future inflation expectations, thebids received at these auctions reflected a marketpreference towards short- term maturities.

Under the Treasury bond programme in 2007,the total funds raised through bond issuesamounted to Rs. 401 billion in face value terms, ofwhich Rs. 18 billion was issued through auctionsand the balance Rs. 383 billion raised throughdirect placements. The government securities marketwas further liberalised in 2007 by increasing themaximum limit of rupee denominated Treasury bondsavailable for foreign investors to 10 per cent of theoutstanding bond stock, from the initially allowedmaximum of 5 per cent. Compared to the previousyear, there was a significant reduction in raising fundsthrough auctions as yield rates of the bids received atthe majority of the auctions were unacceptably higherthan the current market rates. In addition, thegovernment raised Rs.23 billion by issuingnon-tradable Rupee Loans.

Yield rates in the government securities marketshowed an increasing trend throughout the year.The upward movement in secondary market yieldswere in line with primary market rates. Yield rates,which were in the region of 13 per cent at the beginningof the year, rose markedly to about 19 per cent at theend of the year. Treasury bill yields increased by 854,721 and 700 basis points for 91, 182 and 364 daymaturities, respectively, between December 2006 andDecember 2007, while yields for Treasury bonds witha maturity period of 2-3 years increased in the rangeof 258-383 basis points during the same period.

US dollar Denominated Debt: Sri LankaDevelopment Bonds (SLDBs) with a maturity of twoyears were issued in 2007. The auction wasoversubscribed and a total of US dollars 215 millionwas raised at the rate of six month LIBOR plus a marginof 155 basis points. In addition, US dollars 106 millionwas raised through OBU borrowings in 2007. A foreigncommercial borrowing amounting to US dollars 210million through a syndicated loan was obtained in 2007with a tenor of 3 years at the rate of three month LIBORplus a margin of 155 basis points. Sri Lanka's debutsovereign international bond issue helped to ease thepressure in the domestic debt securities market.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

Commercial Paper: The level of activity in theCommercial Paper (CP) market increasedsubstantially during 2007 reflecting the increasingshort-term lending rates of commercial banks. Thetotal value of CP issues, including reissues supported

by banks, was Rs. 31.2 billion in 2007 in comparisonwith Rs. 23.5 billion in 2006. The interest rates on CPsranged between 12 per cent to 25 per cent in 2007compared with 8.5 per cent to 17 per cent in 2006.The higher short-term interest rates for traditional banklending that prevailed during the year provided animpetus to firms to raise funds through the CP market.The CP market is heavily concentrated (91.7 per cent)in the less than three-month maturity, with CPs of sixmonths duration accounting for 7.9 per cent. Thetwelve months duration of CPs accounted for thebalance 0.4 per cent. The total outstanding value ofCPs amounted Rs.4.4 billion at end of 2007.

Corporate Bonds: Banks played a key role inthe fund-raising through the corporate bondmarket. Banks were the main issuers of corporatebonds i.e., debentures in the medium and long-termmarket. During the year, seven banks mobilised fundsamounting to Rs.8.2 billion through debentures,compared to Rs.2.3 billion raised in 2006. The fundswere mainly for the purpose of meeting the capitaladequacy requirements of banks and for businessexpansion. Debentures carrying both fixed and flexibleinterest rates were issued. The interest rates ondebentures varied between 13.5 per cent to 17.5 percent. The turnover of corporate bonds listed on theDebt Trading System of the CSE amounted to onlyRs. 99 million in 2007 compared to Rs. 405 million in2006.

Share Market

Prices and trading on the Colombo StockExchange (CSE) experienced increased volatilityduring 2007. The share market reached record levelsin the first two months of the year with strong interestby local investors, particularly in thetelecommunications sector, but moved downwardsthereafter due to a combination of factors such asheightened security concerns, rising interest rates,which attracted investors to government securities andfixed deposits, forecasts of a moderation in companyprofit growth and the initial impact of the introductionof rules on margin trading by the SEC. In addition, thesmall size of the CSE in terms of market capitalisationand the public float of shares affected market liquidityand contributed to the volatility in prices.

Key market indicators of the CSE declined. TheAll Share Price Index (ASPI) and the Milanka PriceIndex (MPI), which rose to their highest levels inFebruary, declined by 7 per cent and 11 per cent forthe year 2007, compared to an increase of 42 percent and 51 per cent, respectively, in 2006. The marketprice earnings ratio declined from 14 per cent in 2006to 11.6 per cent in 2007.

Market capitalisation also declined to Rs.821billion at end 2007 from Rs.835 billion at end 2006.The average daily turnover was at the same level asin 2006 at Rs.435 million. The sector price indices ofthe three largest sectors, which account for over twothirds of market capitalisation and turnover, namelythe Banks, Finance and Insurance rose by 5.9 per centwhile Telecommunications and the DiversifiedHoldings group declined by 15.8 per cent, and 11.7per cent respectively.

Funds raised through rights issues increasedsignificantly. A positive development was the recordlevel of funds mobilised through rights issues in 2007.A total of 21 companies raised Rs. 43 billion in thismanner. This was the highest amount of capital raisedthough the CSE in any given year either through theprimary or the secondary market. However, there wereno initial public offerings of shares during the year.Domestic investors accounted for 61 per cent of thetotal turnover of the CSE while foreign investorsaccounted for 39 per cent in 2007. The net foreigninflows rose to Rs.11.2 billion, reflecting the increasinginterest of foreign investors in the local stock market.The number of companies listed on the CSE was 235.Two listed companies were de-listed in 2007.

Several market development initiatives wereembarked upon. The CSE has started on aprogramme to promote the listing of new companiesand to broaden the investor base, as well as measuresto increase market liquidity by increasing the publicfloat and permitting short-selling of securities and theintroduction of derivative products. The SEC, which isresponsible for the regulation and supervision of theactivities of the CSE and listed companies, introducedmandatory rules on corporate governance for listedcompanies and issued a directive to investmentmanagers to improve investor protection with the aimof improving public confidence in the equity market.

The SEC Act is being amended to facilitate the issueof derivatives and the Company Takeover and MergersCode is also being amended. The SEC is also handlingin preparation of a new law on Securitisation. Theproposed law will provide for a mechanism for creatingsecuritisation vehicles, transferring assets to suchvehicles and the issuance of asset backed securitiesby such vehicles. This Act is expected to maintain taxneutrality and will provide for investor disclosure andprotection. It is expected to be finalised by the end of2008. In addition, the SEC has initiated theimplementation of the Capital Market Master Plan todevelop the capital market and, in collaboration withthe IBSL, has established a Financial ServicesAcademy to provide professional level education toindustry participants.

8.5 Development Finance and Acces toFinance

During 2007, the outreach of the banking sectorimproved with the expansion of the branchnetwork of both LSBs and LCBs. There was anotable increase in the number of bank branchesoutside the Western Province. The number of newbranches opened by LSBs was 17, of which 16 wereoutside the Western Province. In the case of LCBs,66 new branches were opened, with 49 being outsidethe Western Province. Further, 12 extension officeswere opened by LSBs, for the purpose of facilitatingmain bank branches, of which 7 were outside theWestern Province. LCBs also opened130 extensionoffices, of which 45 were outside the Western Province.

Even though the market interest rates increasedsubstantially, loans at concessionary rates ofinterest continued to be made available for keysectors under a number of refinance schemesoperated by the Central Bank and NationalDevelopment Trust Fund (NDTF), and under interestsubsidy schemes of the Government operated by theCentral Bank.

In the agriculture sector, fund disbursementunder the Second Perennial Crop DevelopmentProject Revolving Fund (SPCDPRF) credit schemeand the Tea Development Project Revolving Fund(TDPRF) credit scheme continued steadily duringthe year. In 2007 these two schemes have distributedRs. 540 million and Rs 411 million, respectively at aninterest rate of 9 per cent, for eligible activities.

Short term cultivation loans to the value of Rs.967 million and Rs. 869 million were disbursedunder the New Comprehensive Rural CreditScheme (NCRCS) in Maha 2006/07 and Yala 2006/

07, respectively. This is a sharp increase whencompared to the previous year when the amount offunds disbursed in Maha 2005/06 and Yala 2006 stoodat Rs. 737 million and Rs. 663 million, respectively.Under the NCRCS scheme, funds are made availableat an interest rate of 8 per cent for both cultivators andproduce buyers, with the government bearing the costof an interest subsidy of 9 per cent. It has now beendecided to increase crop/product coverage under thescheme. Accordingly, in future, the cultivation ofpineapple, sugar cane, betel, anthuriams (for export)and orchids (for export) and the production of beehoney would be eligible for credit under the NCRCS.

Credit was also provided at an interest rate of 8per cent under the Krushi Navodaya Schemeintroduced in the Budget 2007. A total of 5,069 loans,to a value of Rs. 333 million has already beendisbursed under this scheme. Activities eligible forfinancing include improving agricultural activities,processing of agricultural commodities, animalhusbandry, purchase of equipment for thedevelopment of agriculture and allied activities, agro-based and agro related industries, developing microirrigation and drip irrigation and distribution systems,enhancing storage facilities, development of protectedagriculture, organic farming, production of organicfertiliser and extension services for agriculture.

Recognising the urgent need for developing thedairy industry in the wake of escalating globalpowdered milk prices, a special credit packageaimed at reducing the cost of funds for dairyproducers/ processors was included in Budget2008. Under this scheme, Rs. 7,000 million is to bedisbursed to dairy farmers over a period of three yearscommencing 2008 at a concessionary interest rate of8 per cent. The government will be paying an interestsubsidy of 9 per cent to the participating financialinstitutions (PFIs). A further Rs. 2,000 million is to bedisbursed within a period of three years for dairyprocessing / dairy product manufacturing at aconcessionary interest rate of 12 per cent, with thegovernment bearing an interest subsidy cost of 8 percent. Budget 2008 also contained a special creditpackage for providing loans at a concessionary rateof 12 per cent for small and medium scale agroprocessing, which will cater to the fundingrequirements of agro processors needing loans overRs. 100,000 (the upper limit for loans granted underthe Krushi Navodaya Scheme). By coveringprocessing activities in addition to cultivation/production, these special credit packages would beproviding finance along the value chain of agricultural/dairy products and thereby provide a host of benefits

to the farmer/dairy farmer, quite apart from the receiptof concessionary funds for cultivation/production.These include the establishment of a stable marketand an attractive price for their products. Most of theagro processors seeking this facility have alreadydeclared their intention of purchasing their rawmaterial requirements under forward sales contracts.

There were several developments in themicrofinance sector in 2007. NDTF, the successorto the Janasaviya Trust Fund, is an apex institutionfor disbursement of microfinance in Sri Lanka. NDTF'sstrategy to reach the poor in remote areas is to makeuse of community-based grass-root organisationswhich are included among its partner organisationsfor fund disbursement. Total funds to the value of Rs.1,102 million were made available by NDTF for lendingto micro enterprises in agriculture, animal husbandry,fisheries, cottage industries and other incomegenerating activities. Total loan disbursements weresomewhat lower than in the previous year due totermination of disbursements under tsunamiassociated schemes.

NDTF places great emphasis on achievingbalanced regional development by enhancing fundavailability outside the Western Province. Thehighest proportion of loans was disbursed in the NorthCentral Province by NDTF, with almost a third (32.5per cent) of the total value of lending beingconcentrated in that province. Around 16.6 per cent ofthe value of loans went to the North Western Province,with the Kurunegala District alone accounting for 10.4per cent of total value of loans disbursed islandwide.In contrast, only 8.9 per cent of the total value of loansdisbursed by NDTF went to the Western Province.Funds under NDTF lending programmes reached1,354 borrowers in the Northern and EasternProvinces. During the year, the North East CoastalCommunity Development Project (NECCDP) was putin place to channel funds to the conflict affected areasof the Northern and Eastern province. However, creditdisbursement under this project in these areascontinued to be slow.

There were some operational changes made in2007 to the model used hitherto by the CentralBank in its poverty alleviation schemes. Thesehelped to increase the geographic coverage of theschemes and to maximise the funds available for loandisbursement. After the termination of foreign financeassistance for the Poverty Alleviation MicrofinanceProject (PAMP) in December 2006, the PovertyAlleviation Microfinance Programme Revolving FundScheme (PAMPRFS), which is financed out of loanrecoveries of the PAMP scheme, commenced

operations. Unlike PAMP, which was confined to 6districts only, activities of PAMPRFS were undertakenin the most vulnerable Divisional Secretariat divisionsthroughout the country. The Central Bank alsocompleted negotiations with the Japanese Bank forInternational Cooperation (JBIC) on PAMP Phase II,which is to be operated in conflict affected areas andlagging regions. Foreign finance assistance for PAMPII will be around Rs. 2.6 billion and project activitieswill be undertaken in 14 districts. In order to achievemaximum geographic outreach, it has been decidedto operate the PAMPRFS in future in districts otherthan the 14 districts in which PAMP Phase II isoperational and thus PAMPRFS and PAMP II willtogether span the whole island. Further, while the PFIswere mainly confined to the 6 development banks inthe original PAMP programme, PAMPRFS and PAMPII will be operated through 14 PFIs, to further enhancethe outreach of the programmes. In order to rationalisethe administrative expenditure of the PAMPRFS, agreater role was assigned to the PFIs.8.6Financial Infrastructure

Payment and Settlement Systems

Systemically Important Payment Systems: TheLankaSettle system operated by the Central Bank andthe Cheque Imaging and Truncation (CIT) systemoperated by LankaClear are the two systemicallyimportant payment settlement systems.TheLankaSettle system has two components: the inter-bank settlement system that transfers funds to coverpayments between participant institutions i.e., thecommercial banks and primary dealers, through

settlement accounts held with the Central Bank, in areal time network environment; and the LankaSecuresystem, which is the central depository forgovernment securities in scrip-less form. TheLankaSettle system also supports the settlement ofinter-participant transactions in government securitieson a delivery versus payment basis. The CIT systemenables the clearing of cheques and the post clearing,routeing of cheques to the paying banks and transferof inter-bank payment obligations for the settlementin the LankaSettle system.

The two systemically important paymentsystems accounted for 99 per cent of the non-cash payments during 2007, and are benchmarkedto international standards. The systemicallyimportant payment systems have a specialsignificance, as they have a potential to become achannel through which financial risks can betransmitted across financial institutions and financialmarkets. Such contagion risks are greatly minimisedby ensuring the safety and efficiency of the paymentand settlement system and regular system upgradesto keep up with growth in transaction volumes,transaction message throughput, security and newtechnology.

The LankaSettle - Real Time Gross Settlement(RTGS) System: The bulk of the RTGS transactionsby value were in relation to transactions in thegovernment securities market (42 per cent), the inter-bank call money market (38 per cent), and third partycustomer transactions (10 per cent). The total valueof transactions settled through the LankaSettle

system increased by 17 per cent to Rs. 21,266 billionin 2007. The Central Bank continued to provide intra-day liquidity facility (ILF) to participating institutions inthe RTGS system against collateral of governmentsecurities. The daily average value of the ILFrequested was Rs. 4.9 billion, while the ILF utilisedwas Rs. 1.2 billion in 2007, compared with Rs. 2.2billion and Rs.500 million, respectively, in 2006.

The LankaSecure System: The value of scrip-lesssecurities held by LankaSecure as at end 2007amounted to Rs. 1,374 billion and accounted for 99.6per cent of the total value of Treasury bills and Treasurybonds outstanding. The scrip-less securities consistedof Rs. 307 billion Treasury bills and Rs. 1,067 billionTreasury bonds. LankaSecure maintained 41,953accounts through dealer direct participants, coveringcorporate as well as individual customers.

Cheque Imaging and Truncation (CIT) System:The total value of cheques cleared increased by 12per cent to Rs. 4,296 billion in 2007. The operation ofthe CIT sytem achieved greater stability in 2007 withthe system availability for processing of cheques,displaying a substantial improvement over 2006. Thestrengthening of the disaster recovery facilities andthe business continuity plan at LankaClear, enablingconvenient switch-over of operations to the disasterrecovery site, have contributed to the improvement.The Central Bank's oversight activities were mainlyfocused on crediting the proceeds of cheques tocustomer accounts on a T+1 basis, reducing thecheque returns and ensuring the operationalrobustness of the system. Some of the measures thathave been initiated are to encourage direct connectivityto LankaClear to reduce transportation time, directionsissued to the bank branches to display noticesinforming the cut-off times and the time scale forcrediting funds to customer bank accounts after theclearing process. Moreover, the request for additionaldays for clearing by bank branches has beensubstantially reduced with the implementation of theprocedure that such requests are required to beconveyed centrally from the top management ofmember banks. As a measure to reduce chequereturns, a policy decision was taken to stop therepresentation of cheques with "Refer to Drawer" witheffect from 1 April 2008 and to impose a penalty onbanks on dishonoured cheques, while steps have beeninitiated to amend the Credit Information Bureau Actto post information of individuals and companiesinvolved in issuing cheques without funds in theirrespective accounts. Currently the returned chequesaccount for 5.5 per cent by volume of chequespresented for clearing, while value-wise they amountto 3.2 per cent.

Sri Lanka Inter-bank Payments System (SLIPS)and other electronic retail banking services :LankaClear also operates SLIPS, which is an off-lineretail fund transfer system for banks and theircustomers. The value of transactions cleared by SLIPSincreased by 45 per cent to Rs. 176 billion in 2007.The increase was mainly on account of the use of thesystem for the payment of salaries and wages of publicsector and private sector institutions. LankaClear alsoupgraded the system to accommodate the growth involumes and security. The popularity of other electronicretail banking services such as internet banking, phonebanking and electronic payment cards also rosesignificantly in 2007. The value of transactions madeby internet banking, phone banking and payment cardsincreased by 49 per cent, 64 per cent and 25 per cent,respectively, to Rs.150 billion, Rs.54 billion and Rs.70billion, respectively, in the year.

Payment System Policy and Oversight: TheCentral Bank devoted much attention tostrengthening the oversight framework. Theactivities during the year focused on improving theoperational robustness of the systemically importantpayment and settlement systems, including businesscontinuity planning and the establishment of fullfunctioning disaster recovery sites in the Central Bank,LankaClear and the participant institutions. Work inthe other areas included the promotion of furthermigration to electronic payments from predominantlycash/paper based retail payments, issuing directionsto service providers of card-based paymentinstruments and subsequent oversight for complianceand encouraging banks to pass the cost savings andefficiency benefits to customers.

National Payment Council (NPC): Paymenttransfers require a common infrastructure thatcombines systems, structure and service providers tocreate an overall functional payment system. Thechallenge is to create an efficient development processto implement the enhancement of the infrastructure,taking into consideration the need to foster cooperationamong the Central Bank, individual banks andcustomers, to give suppliers in building infrastructurecompetitive opportunities and to meet the reliabilitystandards of the system. Accordingly, the NPC wasestablished and has formulated a Road Map covering2007-2010. The main elements of the Road Map,which will be implemented in 2008, include theestablishment of a common payment switch for banksto facilitate electronic fund transfers for their third partycustomers and the migration to chip-based creditcards.

SAARC Payments Initiative : A SAARC paymentsinitiative was launched to collectively decide on a highlevel strategic direction for reforms in payment andsettlement systems of member countries to reduce riskand increase efficiency and safety in line withinternational best practice, standards and newtechnology and to promote regional harmonisation andintegration of the respective domestic paymentsystems to further facilitate intra-regional commercialactivities.

Legal Enactments and Amendments

The Central Bank continued to review andinitiate reforms to strengthen the existing legalframework and to introduce new legislation to keeppace with financial innovations. The FinanceLeasing Act was amended in 2007 to enablespecialised leasing companies to mobilise funds fromthe public by issuing debt securities, thus broadeningtheir funding sources. The Central Bank is alsopreparing amendments to the Finance Company Actto strengthen the prudential requirements of financecompanies and its investigative powers relating tounauthorised businesses. In order to introduce aregulatory framework for micro-finance institutions, theCentral Bank has drafted legislation to formalise theinstitutional arrangements of micro-finance serviceproviders and to establish a supervisory mechanism,which would enable these entities to have access towider sources of funding and to promote their financialsustainability. The Credit Information Bureau Act is alsobeing revised to extend the scope of its services tomore diverse user groups and to provide value addedservices. In addition, amendments to the DebtRecovery (Special Provisions) Act are beingconsidered to curb threats posed by cheques returneddue to the non-availability of funds.

Further important legislation relating to thedevelopment and stability of the financial sectoris also being finalised. A Securitisation law has beenprepared to facilitate the issuance of asset-backedsecurities through the creation of special securitisationvehicles and the regulation of securitised transactions.The proposed legislation is expected to promote riskmanagement and capital market development. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission Act is also beingamended to facilitate the development of thederivatives industry. The Regulation of InsuranceIndustry Act is also to be amended to strengthenprudential supervision and to permit the appointmentof banks and other financial institutions as agents forthe distribution of insurance products. The newCompanies Act that came into effect in 2007 has a

direct impact on financial institutions, which arecompanies. The law introduced the new concept of"stated capital" and the provision that a company coulddeclare a dividend only if it has positive accumulatedreserves. In addition, corporate governance issues areaddressed by specifying the responsibilities ofdirections and the interests of minority shareholdershave been strengthened.

Regulation and Supervision

The Central Bank, which is responsible forregulating and supervising licensed banks,introduced several prudential measures, in termsof the Banking Act, during the year to strengthenthe framework. A new share-ownership direction wasissued with regard to shares carrying voting rights withthe objective of broad basing the share-ownership andaddressing any conflicts of interests that may arisedue to large shareholdings. The maximum percentageof ownership permitted in the issued share capitalcarrying voting rights will be 15 per cent of issued sharecapital. In order to mitigate credit concentration risk, adirection on the maximum amount of accommodationwas issued. Accordingly, the maximum amount ofaccomodatiion to a single counterparty and to a groupof companies will be limited to 30 per cent and 33 percent of the capital base, respectively. Enhanced limitsare permitted, subject to meeting specified conditions.The capital instruments eligible for inclusion in theregulatory capital were expanded to include perpetualdebt as core capital. The eligibility criteria for hybridcapital and subordinated debt instruments were alsoexpanded.

A Direction on Corporate Governance wasissued to banks aiming at making the Board ofDirectors more responsible and accountable forthe business operations of banks, in order topromote the overall risk management andsoundness of banks. The main aspects of thedirection relate to the composition and responsibilitiesof the board of directors, criteria to assess the fitnessand propriety of directors, management functionsdelegated by the board, separation of duties ofChairman and Chief Executive Officer, boardappointed committees and disclosure of financialstatements. The direction will be applicable fromJanuary 2008, with necessary transitional provisions.

The adoption of the Basel II Capital AdequacyFramework is expected to improve the safety andsoundness of the banking system, by aligningcapital adequacy assessment more closely withthe risk profile in banks. Banks are required to apply

Basel II – An Introduction

“International Convergence of Capital Measurementand Capital Standards”, widely known as Basel II, providesa framework to foster integrated risk management in banks.It is an attempt to address some of the deficiencies in thepreviously adopted capital adequacy standard, Basel I,through the incorporation of a capital charge for operationalrisk (in addition to the credit and market risks) and threeinterlinked pillars, namely, (1) minimum capitalrequirements, (2) supervisory review process and (3)market discipline. Therefore, Basel II is a comprehensiveframework that provides: (1) banking institutions strongerincentives to improve risk measurement and management,(2) regulators to take measures to improve bank safety andsoundness by more closely linking regulatory capitalrequirements with banking risk, and (3) complementaryuse of market mechanism to create a greater accountabilityand transparency to bank management and otherstakeholders of banks.

Adoption of Basel II in Sri Lanka

As announced in its “Road Map for Monetary andFinancial Sector Policies in 2007 and beyond”, the CentralBank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has adopted the Basel II capitaladequacy standards for all licensed banks in Sri Lankaeffective from January 2008. Accordingly, all banks arerequired, in computing the capital charge for capitaladequacy purposes, to follow the Standardised Approachfor credit risk, Standardised Measurement Approach formarket risk and Basic Indicator Approach for operationalrisk, commencing 1st January 2008. In this regard, thepreparatory work undertaken since 2006 is as follows: -

a. Self-assessments by banks that commenced in March2005 to assess the impact on banks were continued.No adverse impact was observed for the bankingindustry since the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)estimated under Basel II for the industry was around13 per cent as against the minimum requirement of 10per cent.

b. The CBSL continued to work closely with the Sub-Committee of the Sri Lanka Banks’ Association(SLBA) to finalise modalities for implementing BaselII, in particular, resolving issues relating to certaindefinitions.

c. In March 2006, guidelines were issued on parallelcomputation of the CAR under Basel II with effect fromthe second quarter of 2006.

Implementation of Basel IICapital Adequacy Standard in Sri Lanka *

* The Central Bank Annual Report 2005 in Box Article 17 presented information onBasel II, its benefits and action taken by the Central Bank towards implementationof Basel II in Sri Lanka. This article provides an update on the progress made inadopting Basel II and the way forward approach followed in the other countries inthe SAARC region.

d. A Help Desk was set up at the Bank SupervisionDepartment to guide and assist banks to move to BaselII. The Help Desk held continuous discussions withthe SLBA and banks individually on implementationissues.

e. A Consultative Paper was issued to banks in June 2007and banks submitted their views mainly on the riskweights applicable on different classes of assets andclarifications on certain terms used in the paper. Aparallel reporting of CAR based on the ConsultativePaper and accuracy of calculation by banks wasverified.

f.While encouraging all banks to train their staffadequately on Basel II, three half-day interactiveseminars for bank officials and an International seminaron “Integrated Risk Management and Implementationof Basel II” were conducted by the CBSL to enhanceawareness.

g. New software to submit the quarterly returns on BaselII in place of Basel I to the CBSL under the web basedonline reporting system was developed and final testingwas carried out for the quarter ending 2007.

h. Guidelines were also issued on preparation for movingtowards advanced approaches covering setting up datawarehouses, stress testing, credit risk mitigation,enhancing market discipline etc.

i.In December 2007, the CBSL issued the Direction onMaintenance of CAR under the Basel II replacing Basel I.

This major policy initiative would contribute topromoting higher standards of risk management amongstthe banking institutions and help a bank to better align itscapital with its risk profile.

Implementation of Basel II in the SARRC Region

Although the Basel II framework provides severaloptions for its implementation based on the level ofsophistication and development of the banking system andcountry situation, the policy approach taken by almost allthe countries in the SARRC region is to adopt the mostsimple approach initially and thereafter to move toadvanced approaches in the medium term. In this process,almost all the countries in the region have already issuedconsultative papers to the banking community for theirviews and recommendations.

•India has announced that Indian banks will initiallyadopt the Standardised Approach for credit risk andBasic Indicator approach for operational risk and

the Standardised Approach for credit risk and marketrisk and the Basic Indicator Approach for operationalrisk from January 2008.

New directions were issued to financecompanies, in terms of the Finance Companies Act,relating to the prohibition on granting financialaccommodation to directors or their relatives, andto business transactions permitted with directorsand their relatives. A direction was also issued tospecialised leasing companies stipulating therequirements that should be fulfilled in raising fundsfrom the public through the issue of debt securitiesunder the Finance Leasing Act.

Regulations on electronic payment cards wereissued under the Payments and SettlementsSystems Act and directions are to be issued forthe supervision of card-based paymentinstruments. Guidelines were also issued on

expects to migrate to Basel II in 2009. The necessaryinfrastructure is being assembled and developed. TheReserve Bank of India has allowed banks to migrateto the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach, providedthat the required skills are developed by both banksand by the supervisors.

•Pakistan will migrate to the Standardised Approachfor credit risk and the Basic Indicator Approach foroperational risk from January 2008 and expects toapply the IRB approach from January 2010.Nevertheless, the banks which have the capacity tomigrate to IRB approach are allowed to apply it before2010. Pakistan has started a parallel run in 2006 aimingat moving towards IRB approach from 2008.

•Bangladesh and Nepal are also moving to Basel II andthe required transition arrangements are being carriedout in order to facilitate a smoother transition fromBasel I.

Way forward in migrating Sri Lankan Banks toAdvanced Approaches

a. Additional guidelines will be issued in 2008 under thestandardised approach with regard to the computationof capital charge for market risk for derivative productsand securitisation.

b. Considering the current level of internal systems, it isexpected to introduce Pillar II, Supervisory ReviewProcess, in 2010 to ensure that banks maintainadequate capital to support all material risks. Theadditional risks considered under Pillar II includecredit concentration risk, interest rate risk in the

banking book, liquidity risk, strategic and reputationalrisk.

c. Capacity building for banks and for officers of the BankSupervision Department will be continued throughregular training programmes and interactive seminarsfor creating data warehouses, risk modeling andvalidation and stress testing on business.

d. It is decided to move to Advanced Approaches from2013 (after 5 years), by when the banks are expectedto have appropriate risk models, risk managementsystems and data warehouses.

e. Guidelines will also be issued to banks on integratedrisk management to improve the risk managementprocesses of banks. This will provide a greaterawareness and better assessment of existing andpotential risks of banks to initiate pro-active measuresby adopting up to date risk management techniques tomitigate such risks. This will also facilitate banks toobtain the full benefit of adopting Basel II.

Basel II is a risk sensitive capital framework thatprovides incentives for better risk management as it givesgreater encouragement for banks to adopt more risksensitive approaches and procedures since more refinedrisk measurement procedures will lead to capital relief.The differentiation of risks afforded under Basel II allowscompetitiveness for banks that have developed a good riskmanagement culture. Thus, the adoption of Basel II willstrengthen the risk management in banks therebyenhancing the safety and soundness of the banking system.

Box 21Multi Level Marketing and Pyramid Schemes

Introduction

Prohibited schemes such as 'Pyramid or Pyramid typeSchemes' are being promoted in different parts of thecountry. Complaints have also been made that theseprohibited schemes are being marketed in the guise ofMulti Level Marketing (MLM) Schemes. Many countriesincluding Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, USA, UKand India have issued several guidelines and definitionsto distinguish MLM from illegal pyramid schemes, andhave introduced new laws to deal with them. Forexample, in Singapore, the Multi-Level Marketing andPyramid Act was passed in 2000. In China, Regulationson Prohibition of Multi Level Marketing promotingPyramid Schemes were issued in 2005. Chapter 3 of theLaws of Japan - Act on Specified CommercialTransactions 1976 - Act No. 57 of June 4, 1976 containslegal provisions to combat pyramid type multi levelmarketing schemes.

Multi Level Marketing (MLM)

In general terms, MLM, known as "network" or"matrix" marketing or "referral" marketing, is a way ofselling goods or services through distributors withoutintermediary retail stores. MLM builds a sales force byrecruiting others to sell products. An extremelyimportant feature is that the compensation orcommission for a promoter who joins the scheme wouldmainly be a percentage based on the sale of products.

Main Characteristics of Pyramid Schemes

Many pyramid schemes often disguise themselves asMLM schemes, which sell collectors' items, software,training programs, etc, although they make money throughrecruitment. Members of the public who attend sales talksconducted by promoters must be vigilant of such schemes.Illegal MLM schemes, which are in reality pyramidschemes, usually share the following characteristics:

•Generally, a pyramid scheme is a recruiting game,which ultimately results in loss to its participants.

•Participants in pyramid or pyramid type multi levelmarketing schemes receive compensation/commissionfor recruiting other participants into the scheme, who,

in turn, obtain commissions by recruiting moreparticipants.

•Promoters emphasise that the way to earn large sumsof money and get rich in a very short time is byrecruiting others to join the scheme.

•Many pyramid or pyramid type multi level marketingschemes involve selling products or services. Theproduct or service that is to be sold is not somethingpeople can buy at the given price. However, the sale ofthe merchandise or service is not the focus of pyramidtype schemes.

•Participants are required to invest money to join thescheme, either in the form of a joining fee, or bybuying a product.

If a pyramid scheme is to continue, more and moreparticipants need to be recruited. A pyramid scheme willeventually collapse when it runs out of new participants.When this happens, the vast majority of participants losewhatever time and money invested, while the originatingcompany or person and a few frontline distributors profitfrom those who lose their money.

The general public have been advised by the CentralBank through newspaper advertisements and pamphletsto be cautious about illegal pyramid and pyramid type multilevel marketing schemes and not to engage in illegalactivities by joining these schemes. The public are alsorequested to provide information to the Central Bank inthe event that they come across any suspicious schemes.The public must understand that persons participating inpyramid and pyramid type multi level marketing schemeseventually lose their hard-earned money.

Penalties under the Banking Act

The general public are cautioned that they must not, inany way, participate in such schemes since these areillegal and criminal activities prohibited under Section 83(C) of the Banking Act. Any person who contravenessubsection 83(C) (1) of the Banking Act, shall be guilty ofan offence and shall be liable on conviction aftersummary trial before a Magistrate, for imprisonment ofeither description for a term not exceeding three years orto a fine not exceeding rupees one million or to both suchimprisonment and fine.

This highlevel council was formed in 2007 and is chaired bythe Governor of the Central Bank and comprises theheads of the SEC, IBSL, NPC, CSE, Registrar ofCompanies, Sri Lanka Accounting and AuditingMonitoring Board, Institute of Chartered Accountantsand the Department of Co-operative Development.Working Group of Regulators on FinancialConglomerates which is required to assess thesystemic risks posed by financial conglomerates andto propose mechanisms for the supervision of thesecomplex financial institutions, is expected to report toIRIC.Credit Rating

The sovereign rating of the Government of SriLanka for 2007 was maintained at the same levelas in the previous year. Fitch Ratings assigned along-term foreign and local currency rating of "BB-"(BB minus), while Standard and Poor's (S & P)assigned a rating of "B+" (B plus). The sovereign ratingassisted the government in raising US dollar 500million through the issue of a five year fixed interestrate bond in the international capital market.There were two credit rating agencies operatingin Sri Lanka in 2007. The Central Bank requiresdeposit-taking institutions (licensed banks andregistered finance companies) to obtain a credit ratingfrom an independent rating agency and to disclose itto the public, to further improve confidence in thefinancial system. In 2007, 22 LCBs and 10 LSBs hadobtained investment grade ratings, while 11 RFCs alsohad investment grade ratings.

Credit Information

The Credit Information Bureau (CRIB), whichprovides credit information reports on borrowers,recorded an increase in the number of reportsprovided to member credit institutions, namelyLCBs, LSBs, RFCs and SLCs. CRIB issued 884,620credit reports on corporate and individual borrowersin 2007 compared with 801,508 reports in 2006,indicating that these reports are becoming an integralpart of the credit appraisal procedure of lendinginstitutions. The number of reporting credit institutionsalso increased to 95 in 2007, from 93 in the previousyear. Until the end of 2007, CRIB collected informationon both positive (regular) and negative (irregular) creditfacilities, which were Rs.500,000 and over andinformation on credit cards with outstanding balancesof Rs.5,000 and over, which were more than 90 daysoverdue.

CRIB launched on-line operations and willcontinue to collect both positive and negativecredit information without any limits on restrictionsincluding all types of credit facilities from thebeginning of 2008. The new CRIB law is to be passedby the Parliament in 2008 and it would enable CRIBto expand its services to other credit grantors, insurers,utility providers and state agencies and for theprovision of value added services, such as creditscoring and fraud prevention. CRIB will also beauthorised to collect data on returned cheques andfunction as the filing office for secured transactionsunder the proposed Securitisation (SecuredTransactions) law.
