Rising interest rates inthe US led to the bursting of the housing bubble in thatcountry and consequential high default rates on sub-primemortgages. Once housing prices started to drop moderatelyin 2006-2007 in many parts of the US, refinancing becamerather difficult. The default of loans and foreclosure activityincreased dramatically as interest rates of adjustable ratemortgages (ARM) were re-set higher. The increase indefault rates affected not only mortgage lenders thatretained credit risk, but also corporate and individualinvestors holding mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) orcollateralised debt obligations (CDOs). They facedsignificant losses as the value of the underlying mortgageassets declined. Stock markets in many countries also wereaffected significantly. Perhaps the most severe effect wasthat the widespread dispersion of credit risk and the unclearimpact on financial institutions caused lenders to reducelending activity or to demand higher interest rates forcredit, thus creating a liquidity and credit crunch. Thistightening of liquidity conditions spread to many developedmarkets and even led to run on a British bank,viz, NorthernRock. This liquidity concerns compelled central banks inmajor economies to inject liquidity to the market on a largescale to maintain market and financial system stability.",

Although liquidityrisks are inherent in the maturity transformation servicesoffered by banks, banks need to pay close attention toliquidity demand arising both from on-balance-sheetmaturity mismatches and off- balance-sheet exposures.Therefore, adequacy of liquidity has to be given as muchimportance as capital adequacy in maintaining thesoundness of banks.

Inorder to mitigate model risks measures, such as awarenessbuilding, evaluation of and understanding of assumptions,use of simple models and back testing and stress testingare essential.\u2022Enhancing transparency in markets and institutions:Supervisory and regulatory frameworks need to be updatedin line with new developments and financial innovations.This applies to both crisis prevention frameworks and crisisresolution frameworks. In USA some mortgage originatorswere unregulated entities and were not subject toappropriate disclosure and consumer protectionrequirements. Supervisors and regulators in other countrieshave to ask whether their frameworks are adequate, forinstance, the opacity in the hedge fund activities and inthe OTC market also point to the need for transparencyand improved disclosures.\u2022Adverse incentives : The recent developmentsilluminated the adverse incentives that had been allowedto develop in the distribution chain for credit products,including the strong incentives for originators to putquantity above quality, for the rating agencies to expandtheir scope as widely as possible, and for banks to use off-balance-sheet vehicles to finance structured credits. It mayalso reveal some flaws in compensation schemes in banks.In some cases these incentives arose despite regulation; inothers they were the consequence of faults in the regulatorysystem.\u2022Pro-cyclicality of risk : The crisis showed again howmeasures of risk used by companies and regulators can bepro-cyclical, encouraging more risk taking at the top ofthe cycle and potentially exacerbating the downswing.",

In the higher interest rate environmentthat prevailed in 2007, finance and leasing companiesbecame more vulnerable to interest rate risk. Theprofitability of finance and leasing companies hasbecome constrained due to the contraction in interestmargins, as funding becomes more expensive in thehigher interest rate environment. These companies arepredominantly engaged in the leasing financebusiness, which are typically medium-term contractsat fixed interest rates. Finance companies have tomobilise funds at higher rates than banks and thereforehave to charge higher interest rates from theircustomers, hence they have a higher risk profile thanbanks. In addition, leasing companies are largelydependent on banks for their funding requirement andbanks are also their competitors in the leasingbusiness. However, the recently strengthened capitalpositions and provisioning policies of these companieswill provide a financial buffer to withstand thesestresses.",

In addition, the minimumequity capital for insurance companies will beincreased to Rs. 250 million for each line of insurancebusiness in 2008, which may lead to industryconsolidation.

The LankaSettlesystem has been functioning without major interruptionand the system availability was very high at 99.8 percent in 2007. The CIT system experienced a minordisruption during the year, but that had no impact onfinancial system stability.

All clearing systems settle their netobligations in the LankaSettle system, except the twoclearing systems operated by the CSE for equity anddebt securities. To further strengthen the stability ofthe payments and settlement system, it is desirablethat the net obligations of these two systems also beshifted to the LankaSettle system. The NationalPayments Council (NPC) is implementing its medium-term road map to modernise the financial infrastructurein keeping with the latest technological developmentswith a focus on improving the efficiency, security andrisk management.

During 2007interest income increased by 43 per cent while interestexpenses increased by 59 per cent. As a result, netinterest income rose only by 20 per cent. Although theproportion of operating expenses, including provisionsfor bad and doubtful debts, to total expensesdecreased from 43 per cent recorded in 2006 to 40per cent in 2007, net profit before tax of Rs. 2.7 billionreported for the period ended 31 December 2006 haddecreased to Rs. 2.6 billion for the period ended 31December 2007. This can be attributed to the fact thatthe lending rates of RFCs did not adjust as swiftly astheir cost of funds to the rise in interest rates in theeconomy during 2007.",

Moreover, the request for additionaldays for clearing by bank branches has beensubstantially reduced with the implementation of theprocedure that such requests are required to beconveyed centrally from the top management ofmember banks. As a measure to reduce chequereturns, a policy decision was taken to stop therepresentation of cheques with \"Refer to Drawer\" witheffect from 1 April 2008 and to impose a penalty onbanks on dishonoured cheques, while steps have beeninitiated to amend the Credit Information Bureau Actto post information of individuals and companiesinvolved in issuing cheques without funds in theirrespective accounts.

Therefore, Basel II is a comprehensiveframework that provides: (1) banking institutions strongerincentives to improve risk measurement and management,(2) regulators to take measures to improve bank safety andsoundness by more closely linking regulatory capitalrequirements with banking risk, and (3) complementaryuse of market mechanism to create a greater accountabilityand transparency to bank management and otherstakeholders of banks.",
