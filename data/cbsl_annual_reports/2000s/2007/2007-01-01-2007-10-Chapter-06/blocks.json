    "text": "The international price of crude oil, surpassed USdollars 100 per barrel by December 2007, reflecting a 285per cent increase from July 2003 when it was only USdollars 26 per barrel. By mid March 2008, the price of crudeoil was fluctuating between US dollars 106 and 111 perbarrel in the international markets. This rapid increase hasbeen attributed to low global stocks, short-term supplyconstraints, enhanced demand emanating from emergingmarket countries such as China and India and other geo-political issues. Projections indicate that oil prices wouldremain at high levels in the immediate future as well as inthe medium term.Sri Lanka meets its entire petroleum requirementthrough imports. The total expenditure on petroleumimports has increased to US dollars 2,497 million in 2007with the average import price increasing to US dollars 69per barrel. In contrast, in 2003, the average import pricewas US dollars 29 per barrel and the total expenditure wasonly US dollars 838 million. As per current predictions,the total oil import expenditure will increase further to USdollars 3,122 million in 2008.Similar to many other countries, the high internationaloil prices have had adverse economic implications for SriLanka. The impact has manifested in higher inflation,widened external trade account and in 2004 and 2005, inhigher budget deficits. In particular, a significant impactwas seen on the government fiscal operations dependingon the level of subsidies that were provided to keep thedomestic petroleum prices artificially low.High oil prices could have adverse implications on thefiscal sector in Sri Lanka mainly through two channels.\u2022Firstly, if the Government were to refrain from adjustingthe prices of petroleum products, in line with theinternational market prices, it would have to incur anadditional expenditure on higher subsidies to fill thedifferences between the actual costs and the domesticretail prices of the same. Hence, additional funds willbe necessary to provide subsidies on a continuous basis.The additional resource requirement can be met througha number of ways;-Increasing taxes in other areas: This will create anadditional burden on the tax payers and the generalpublic.-Holding back on other types of expenditures: Theprovision of subsidies would crowd out resourcesthat are available for other priority spending,especially capital expenditure. Since it is the capitalexpenditures that generate future income streams,",

    "text": "the petroleum subsidy may affect the future incomegenerating capacity of the country.-Resorting to higher borrowings: If the governmentfinances oil subsidies through higher borrowings,it will either crowd out credit available for otherproductive purposes or would create inflationarypressures in the economy, if such borrowings werefrom the banking system.\u2022Secondly, when the Government reduces or exemptstaxes on petroleum products to maintain arbitrarily lowprices in the domestic market, the Government wouldincur revenue losses, which would widen the budgetdeficit further.Accordingly, the subsidies compromise the fiscalposition of the Government by way of excessive andunpredictable outlays, and revenue losses. In addition,subsidies essentially distort market prices. The price of agood generally provides a signal to the market to ensurethe optimum allocation of limited resources. Thus, bymaking petroleum products available in the market at anartificially lower price, the Government encourages an overconsumption of petroleum products, which results in amisallocation of resources.If the Government is concerned about the poorersegments of petroleum product users, it would be moreefficient to address the issue through targeted subsidies, asblanket subsidies tend to be more expensive and misused. Ithas been found that the benefits of energy subsidies areenjoyed mostly by the non-poor (Devarajan and Ghani,2006). The cost of the subsidies will have to be financed bythe government through taxes and inflationary borrowing.Hence, ultimately, the costs of the subsidies are shared bythe general public, including the poor. Therefore, theadjustment of fuel prices could be considered as anappropriate policy measure, since any delay in adjustingprices would require more abrupt and larger adjustments ata later stage.In line with this, the government introduced a formulabased pricing mechanism to rationalize the pricing ofpetroleum products in 2003 with a view to reducing the fiscalcost. It was also expected to pass any benefit or cost arisingfrom the changes in the cost of petroleum products toconsumers in a transparent manner. However, even thoughthe international oil prices continued to rise since 2003, theadjustment of domestic petroleum prices according to thispricing formula was abandoned in 2004 and allowed only apartial pass-through on ad-hoc basis. As a result, thegovernment had to compensate oil companies withsubsidies (Chart B 14.1).",

The amountspent by the government as fuel subsides, particularly in2005, amounted to about 58 per cent of the expenditure onhealth and about 41 per cent of the expenditure oneducation.Meanwhile, the VAT on diesel was eliminated in August2005 and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) wasexempted from the payment of excise duty of Rs. 2.50 perlitre on diesel for power generation causing a revenue lossto the government. In addition, CEB was provided with across subsidy on diesel by supplying diesel at a lower rateuntil end December 2007.The non-adjustment of prices exerted a huge burdenon the budget, particularly in 2004 and 2005, leading tohigher government borrowings from the banking system.During these two years, higher borrowings were alsorecorded by the state owned enterprises (SOEs) such asCeylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and CEB. Higherborrowings by both, the government and SOEs, resultedin a larger monetary expansion during these years,contributing towards a build up of inflationary pressuresin the economy.Since then, CPC has improved its financial positionthrough a variety of measures. These include increasingthe efficiency of refineries, hedging oil purchases againstadverse price movements, improving its financialmanagement and internal controls, importing refinedproducts on a more competitive basis and negotiating formore favourable terms on suppliers\u2019 credit, etc. However,it still faces cash flow problems due to an accumulation ofarrears by CEB, which continues to make losses, mainlydue to non-adjustment of electricity tariff to reflect the costsand hence, poses a threat to the budget. In order to remedythis situation, electricity tariff was revised from March2008. This would be an appropriate move as far as thefiscal cost is concerned, since evidence indicates thatdistortions arising due to non-adjustment of electricityprices could get worse unless remedial measures are taken promptly.",

With this, the fuelsubsidy given to CPC and Lanka Indian Oil Company Ltd.(LIOC) was discontinued with a view of reducing the fiscalcost of subsidies.In order to cushion the burden of the removal of subsidyon the poor and vulnerable groups, the governmentintroduced targeted subsidies. Accordingly, the governmenthas been providing an allowance of Rs. 100 per month as asubsidy for kerosene to Samurdhi recipients. A one offpayment of Rs. 4,000 was also made to fishing boat ownersin August 2007. The estimated cost of these measures in2007 was about Rs. 632 million. The Government alsoreduced the Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol from 15 percent to 5 per cent since January 2008, which is expected toreduce the government revenue by Rs. 7,400 million in2008. The Budget 2008 has also indicated that if thisreduction is deemed to be insufficient in the context ofchanging international oil prices, the removal of excise dutyon petrol would be considered. As the international pricesremained high, the government revised the petroleum priceson 13 January 2008 as well. Nevertheless, any benefitaccruing due to a decline in the international prices isexpected to be provided to the general public by reducingdomestic prices.An upward movement in the cost of living was observedsince mid 2007 largely due to the removal of the fuelsubsidy and increases in prices of imported food products.The pass through of international price increases, thoughit leads to a one time increase in prices, will have afavourable impact on containing future inflation byeliminating the need for subsidising same, throughexpansionary borrowings of the government.Reference:Devarajan, S. and Ejaz Ghani (2006), \u201cOil Price Shocks,Fiscal Adjustment and Poverty Reduction in SouthAsia\u201d, Proceedings of the SAARCFINANCE Seminaron \u201cOil Price Hike: Implications for SAARCCountries\u201d, January 20, Central Bank of Sri Lanka.",

The overrunin the recurrent expenditure was mainly due to theincreases in salaries and wages, pension payments,interest payments and security related expenditure.Salaries and wages increased by 22.4 per cent to Rs.214 billion mainly due to the full impact of therecruitments made under the graduate employmentscheme in 2006 and the new recruitments to the publicsector, including defence establishments, payment ofincentive allowance in lieu of leave not availed by publicofficers and higher expenditure on COLA. The shareof salaries and wages in recurrent expenditureincreased to 34.3 per cent compared with 32 per centrecorded in 2006. The increase in pension paymentsby 18.6 per cent was mainly attributed to the increasein COLA to pensioners, correction of anomalies andthe impact of the entry of around 18,000 newpensioners in 2007. The interest payments increasedby 21 per cent compared to the previous year mainlydue to the higher and more volatile interest rates thatprevailed in the domestic market and the shift ininvestor preference towards the shorter end of thematurity spectrum. Additional funds were required fordefence related activities as the government had tointensify counter terrorism measures to ensure nationalsecurity. These were mainly to meet the expenditureon salaries and wages and other needs of securitypersonnel, including the new recruits, and thereplenishment and procurement of security relatedequipment. The IDPs were provided with shelter, foodsand medical needs while developing infrastructure tocreate economic activities to bring life back to normalin the respective areas. The welfare expenditure onthe provision of free text books, season tickets,nutritional food to school children, bursaries,assistance to disabled soldiers etc., continued toincrease. The government continued to providebudgetary assistance to STEs (which include SLR andDOP) as they continued to incur operating losses.",
