6.1 Overview

n 2007, the fiscal policy thrust continuedto be placed on achieving the pro-poorpro-growth development objective of thegovernment, while strengthening the fiscalconsolidation process. Fiscal strategy wasformulated within the overall policy directionenunciated in the “Ten-year Horizon DevelopmentFramework: 2006-2016” (Ten-year Vision). Meetingthe targets in Budget 2007 was endeavoured throughimplementing measures to enhance revenue,rationalise recurrent expenditure and therebygenerate a surplus in the current account, whileenhancing public investment to create an enablingenvironment for higher economic growth towardsreducing poverty and regional economic disparitieson a sustainable basis.

The fiscal targets were to be met in the faceof several challenges. The escalated terroristactivities necessitated the government to enhancecounter measures to strengthen national security.The relatively high inflation and inflationaryexpectations resulted in the government’s takingadditional fiscal measures to address the rising costof goods and services. The high and volatile interestrates in the domestic market necessitated thegovernment to follow a cautious approach in debtmanagement. The exceptionally high international oilprices compelled the government to implementdifficult price reforms to prevent the accumulation oflarge budgetary pressures. These developments alsoresulted in deviations in the factors associated withunderlying assumptions of Budget 2007 affecting thetargeted outcomes.

The fiscal sector performance continued toimprove amidst the challenges faced in fiscalmanagement. Total revenue increased by 18.3 percent compared to 2006 benefiting from continuousefforts made by the government in further

strengthening tax administration, streamlining taxincentives and exemptions, enhancing tax complianceand strengthening enforcement. However, it was lowerthan the expected level mainly due to the declinedrevenue from international trade related taxes,particularly as a result of providing tax concessionson imported essential commodities to address therising cost of living and lower quantity and lower valueof vehicle imports due to the high effective tax ratestructure maintained on fuel inefficient vehicles tocontain the impact of escalating oil prices. The revenueloss due to these two factors alone has been estimatedto be about Rs. 24 billion (0.7 per cent of GDP).However, the revenue from income taxes exceededthe target. Accordingly, total revenue amounted to 15.8per cent of GDP compared to 16.3 per cent in theprevious year. The recurrent expenditure, which was17.4 per cent of GDP, exceeded the budgetary targetof 16.8 per cent, but was significantly lower than thatof 18.6 per cent in the previous year. Despite the heavypressure on recurrent expenditure, public investmentsustained its rising trend and reached 6.4 per cent ofGDP, compared to 6 per cent in 2006 as a result of theacceleration of infrastructure projects andimprovements in financing. As a combined outcomeof these developments, the overall budget deficit turnedout to be 7.7 per cent of GDP, a decline compared toboth the original target of 8.4 per cent and the deficitof 8 per cent in 2006. The deficit in the current accountdeclined further to 1.6 per cent of GDP compared to2.4 per cent in 2006, while the primary deficit alsodeclined to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in 2006.

There was a notable change in the financingmix of the budget deficit in 2007. Financing fromforeign sources was higher than the domestic sourcesas a result of the proceeds from the successfullycompleted debut international bond issue of the countryand foreign investments in rupee denominatedTreasury bonds. Consequently, the reliance ondomestic financing declined and was lower than the

budgeted level. Borrowing from the banking systemrecorded a significant decline over the previous year.It was marginally lower than the original target as well.

The government debt to GDP ratio continuedto decline further in 2007 demonstratingcontinuous improvement in debt sustainability.This improvement was due to the stabilisation of therupee vis-a-vis major foreign currencies towards thelatter quarter of the year and higher nominal economicgrowth, which exceeded the growth in nominal debt. Itwas 85.8 per cent as at end 2007 compared to 88.7per cent at end 2006, although the nominal debt wasincreased by 18 per cent to Rs. 3,070 billion. It alsoindicated a continuous decline from 105.6 per cent ofGDP in 2002. This favourable trend needs to becontinued with stronger efforts to achieve targetsstipulated in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility)Act.

Notwithstanding the improvements in 2007, thefiscal sector still suffers from several drawbacks.In particular, there was a revenue shortfall of Rs. 35billion (1.0 per cent of GDP) in 2007 in comparison tothe original target, while the recurrent expenditureexceeded the target by Rs. 26 billion (0.7 per cent ofGDP). Public investment, though increased, was lowerthan the budgetary target by Rs. 74 billion (2.1 percent of GDP).

The deviations from budgetary targets led toseveral adverse ramifications. The revenue shortfalland the overrun in recurrent expenditure necessitatedthe government to make borrowings to meet theadditional fund requirement resulting in an increase inthe future debt stock and the interest cost. Theincurrence of recurrent expenditure over and abovethe target acts as an impediment for the long rungrowth potential of the country, as it reduces theresources available for public investment. Theopportunity cost involved in such expenditures is muchhigher in terms of the benefits that could accrue fromcapital investments in the future. In addition, the slowprogress in the public investment programme leads tocost escalations, requiring a higher amount ofresources in the future to implement the infrastructureprojects. Meanwhile, the financial performance ofmajor State Trading Enterprises (STEs) remains as astrain on the government budget. The financialperformance of some State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)also remains a concern. This situation underscoresthe need for strong measures to further improve fiscalconsolidation process to reduce the debt burden andachieve fiscal sustainability in the medium to long run,as envisaged in the Ten-year Vision.

6.2Fiscal Policy Direction and Measures

The fiscal policy was formulated within theoverall development strategy and broader targetsenunciated in the Ten-year Vision of thegovernment. The overall fiscal policy and fiscaloperations in 2007 were steered with the objective of

meeting targets in the Medium Term Macro FiscalFramework (MTMFF) for 2006-2009, which wasreleased along with Budget 2007. In moving towardsthe fiscal consolidation path mentioned therein,measures were introduced on all the fronts; revenue,recurrent expenditure, public investment and debtmanagement in 2007.

The government introduced a series ofmeasures to sustain the increasing trend ingovernment revenue, as it is one of the keypriorities in the medium term fiscal strategy. Majormeasures included rationalising income tax and ValueAdded Tax (VAT) systems, introducing changes inexcise duties, rationalising import duties, revising Cessrates on non-essential imports, increasing Port andAirport Development Levy (PAL), introducing changesin stamp duties, debits tax and regional infrastructuredevelopment levy, further strengthening taxadministration and prompt enacting of revenue relatedlegislation.

A number of measures were introduced tobroaden the income tax base, while providingnecessary incentives for the development ofselected areas. Accordingly, life insurance was madeto be assessed separately from other types ofinsurance, while the threshold of turnover in the caseof Economic Service Charge (ESC) was reduced. TheESC rates on industries engaged in producing selectedvalue added goods and services were reduced, andthe method related to the treatment of bad debtprovisioning of banks and financial institutions, wasrevised. In addition, the laws were tightened tominimise tax evasion, and a number of revisions wereintroduced to provide exemptions and otherdevelopment measures.

The rationalisation of the VAT system involvedbroadening the base and changing the rateapplicable on selected sectors to provideconcessions for the development of such sectors.The key measures included imposing restrictions oninput tax credit, increasing the mark-up on the CIFvalue to 10 per cent from 7 per cent, and reducingVAT on high-tech medical equipment and selected fooditems of mass consumption. Provisions were made toallow businesses, which are on the border of the VATthreshold of Rs. 1.8 million, to pay a 5 per cent non-refundable VAT. Some sectors, such as the supply ofelectricity, furnace oil, and machinery and equipmentimported by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and privatepower suppliers, supply of prawns, importation of cattle,buffaloes etc. and livestock breeding items, machineryto modernise factories in the plantation sector,

materials for processing and manufacturing leatherproducts, and vessels were exempted from VAT. Inaddition, the VAT refund process was streamlinedfurther.

A number of excise duty changes were alsointroduced in 2007. Key changes included anincrease of excise duty on selected brands of cigarettesand liquor, excluding beer, and imposition of a 5 percent excise duty on polythene and paints. However,the excise duty on polythene and paints was laterexempted for manufacturers with a turnover of lessthan Rs. 50 million with a view of supporting small andmedium scale Enterprises (SMEs). In order to clearthe ambiguities and to reduce tax loopholes, theHarmonised System (HS) Codes relating to vehicleswere revised. The mark-up added on the CIF value forcharging excise duty at the point of import wasincreased to 15 per cent from 10 per cent. Meanwhile,concessionary duty rates were granted for publicservants for the importation of vehicles.

Measures were introduced to rationalize importduties, which included imposing specific duty rateson selected items to minimise undervaluation andexempting some items, such as machinery formodernisation of factories in the plantation sector, rawmaterials used in the leather and livestock sectors andbuses imported by the private sector. As a measure ofcountering the rising cost of goods and services, dutywaivers were granted on the importation of essentialcommodities. A single import duty rate was imposedon ten selected commodities in lieu of a number oftaxes applicable on them in order to simplify the taxcollection process. Furthermore, duty waivers and dutyexemptions were granted to selected sectors topromote them.

In strengthening the tax administration further,emphasis was placed on institutional developmentand capacity building, particularly in humanresources. The Inland Revenue Department (IRD)recruited about 1,000 officers to expedite the work,while steps were taken to train existing staff as well asthe new recruits in computer literacy and Englishlanguage. Selected staff were also sent abroad tostudy the systems used by other countries. The SriLanka Customs (SLC) was also strengthened its cadreby recruiting 107 officers in January 2008. In addition,measures were taken to promote a taxpayer friendlyculture at IRD to improve tax compliance. Theseincluded “taxpayer awareness programmes”implemented through regional seminars andadvertisements in the media.

The Fiscal Management Reform Programme(FMRP), continued to provide support for capacitybuilding and institutional development at IRD, SLC,Excise Department (ED) and Ministry of Financeand Planning (MOFP). The focus was on improvingthe information and communication technology,establishing a comprehensive and integratedmanagement information system, providing moderninfrastructure and developing human resources.Accordingly, two fully equipped IT labs were set up inIRD and ED while a Revenue AdministrationManagement Information System (RAMIS) was beingintroduced in a phased manner. The equipmentrequired to set up a Local Area Network and Wide AreaNetwork in IRD is in the process of being procured. Inaddition, the metropolitan branches of IRD were setup aiming at large taxpayers and to promote voluntarycompliance. Foreign training was sponsored for therevenue departments, the Finance Commission andthe Provincial Councils. Business communicationtraining programmes for officers in IRD and knowledgeenhancing seminars on the salient features of the newCompanies Act were held during the year.Furthermore, measures were taken to enhance theauditing capacity and streamline procedures in IRD.Three new departments; Legal, Research andStrategic Planning, were also set up in IRD.

Several policy initiatives were implemented torationalise recurrent expenditure. Accordingly, theinterest rates on public servants’ housing loans wereraised to reflect current interest cost of these loans,while the rates applicable to the lower income earnersin the public sector were kept unchanged. Measureswere also taken to improve cadre management. Theadjustment of Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) wasoperated under a cap of Rs. 375 for each six monthperiod. The fuel allowance, paid to public servants,remained unchanged despite several revisions indomestic petroleum prices. As the retail price ofkerosene was increased significantly since July 2007,the government commenced to provide a limitedsubsidy through specific schemes for Samurdhirecipients and fishermen with a view of mitigating theimpact.

The recruitments to the public sector werecontinued, while issuing new recruitmentguidelines with a view to strengthening the publicsector and improving its service deliverymechanism. New recruitments in the civil sectorincluded teachers, nurses, doctors and other positions,including the positions filled by recruiting graduates.There were new recruitments to the defence

establishments as well to strengthen national security.For the new recruitments in the civil sector to besuccessful and generate a positive outcome to theeconomy, they have to be employed towards improvingefficiency and productivity of the public service. Theincreasing recruitments will also lead to a further risein the already high salary bill of the public sector.

Measures were taken to create an efficient fundtransfer system between the Treasury and the lineministries and vice versa. This system is expectedto reduce procurement delays, expedite reimbursementof funds and monitor the progress of foreign aidedprojects, on a continuous basis. Under this system,bank accounts of the government ministries anddepartments were linked to create a network toexpedite the transfer of funds efficiently. This measureis expected to enable the utilisation of all unused cashbalances in government cash accounts. As this willlower the Treasury’s overdraft balances with statebanks, a decline in the interest cost on overdrafts isalso expected.

The Strategic Enterprise Management Agency(SEMA) continued to improve the performance ofseveral Strategic State Owned Enterprises(SSOEs). Accordingly, SEMA assisted to improve thefinancial positions of SSOEs coming under differentClusters. Arranging discussions with CEB anddevelopment partners for restructuring the long-termdebt and re-negotiating the terms and conditions withIndependent Power Producers (IPPs), and obtaininga lubricant licence for Ceylon Petroleum Corporation(CPC) were some of the activities of the Utilities Clusterof SEMA. Initiatives by SSOEs under the Transportand Logistics Cluster focused on improving theirfinancial positions. Several steps were taken for thedevelopment of the enterprises under the PlantationCluster to reduce their losses including thedevelopment of Key Production Indicators (KPI) andKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each plantationcrop sector as management tools to monitor the sector.With the suspension of the operations of PublicEnterprises Reforms Commission (PERC) as aseparate entity in November 2006 in line with thegovernment’s policy of refraining fromprivatisation of SOEs, PERC was brought underthe purview of Public Enterprises Department(PED) of the MOFP. Accordingly, in January 2007,PERC was entrusted with restructuring 25 SOEs thatwere deemed to be “non-functional”, as commerciallyviable institutions, to make them less dependent ontransfers from the Treasury. While some of theseenterprises were in the process of being diagnosed,others were being restructured. Advice from experts

was sought to make them function more efficiently andeffectively, and thereby, make their products andservices more competitive.

The policy and strategy to develop an efficientnetwork of economic and social infrastructure,which has been identified as an essentialrequirement towards achieving a sustained higheconomic growth and development, have beenenunciated in the policy documents of thegovernment, including the Ten-year Vision. The“Randora”, the national infrastructure developmentprogramme, aims to provide a modern infrastructureto promote nation-wide economic development, createincome earning opportunities and promote newavenues of investment. In the economic infrastructurefront, roads, transport, electricity, water supply andsanitation, irrigation and urban development have beengiven the priority. In line with this, several strategicdevelopment projects such as Norochcholai coal powerplant, Upper Kotmale hydro power plant, andKerawalapitiya combined cycle power plant, whichwere delayed for a long time due to various reasons,were initiated. Other major infrastructure developmentprojects, such as the Southern Highway project andMoragahakanda irrigation project etc., were also inprogress. In addition, a number of rural infrastructuredevelopment projects were continued while severalspecial programmes were implemented with a view ofrestoring community infrastructure, supportinglivelihood development and promoting micro enterprisedevelopment. The rebuilding of the conflict affectedareas through rehabilitation and reconstruction of basicinfrastructure facilities, and resettlement and thesupport of livelihood of people affected by the conflictwere emphasised. Rural development initiativescontinued to be targeted particularly on the poorest119 Divisional Secretariat areas. The empowermentof the rural poor was also attempted through promotingsocio-economic activities. In the social infrastructurefront, investments were enhanced in education forincreasing access to education in order to promotemore opportunities, training and employment to ahigher number of youth. As the priority has been givento invest in people to build a healthier human resourcebase for a prosperous society, investments in healthwas also increased. During the year, negotiations ona number of new investment projects were completedand financing for several projects was beingnegotiated. Tsunami reconstruction work alsocontinued during the year.

The development of newly liberated EasternProvince gained momentum in 2007. In line with this,a large number of families who were displaced due to

The international price of crude oil, surpassed USdollars 100 per barrel by December 2007, reflecting a 285per cent increase from July 2003 when it was only USdollars 26 per barrel. By mid March 2008, the price of crudeoil was fluctuating between US dollars 106 and 111 perbarrel in the international markets. This rapid increase hasbeen attributed to low global stocks, short-term supplyconstraints, enhanced demand emanating from emergingmarket countries such as China and India and other geo-political issues. Projections indicate that oil prices wouldremain at high levels in the immediate future as well as inthe medium term.Sri Lanka meets its entire petroleum requirementthrough imports. The total expenditure on petroleumimports has increased to US dollars 2,497 million in 2007with the average import price increasing to US dollars 69per barrel. In contrast, in 2003, the average import pricewas US dollars 29 per barrel and the total expenditure wasonly US dollars 838 million. As per current predictions,the total oil import expenditure will increase further to USdollars 3,122 million in 2008.Similar to many other countries, the high internationaloil prices have had adverse economic implications for SriLanka. The impact has manifested in higher inflation,widened external trade account and in 2004 and 2005, inhigher budget deficits. In particular, a significant impactwas seen on the government fiscal operations dependingon the level of subsidies that were provided to keep thedomestic petroleum prices artificially low.High oil prices could have adverse implications on thefiscal sector in Sri Lanka mainly through two channels.•Firstly, if the Government were to refrain from adjustingthe prices of petroleum products, in line with theinternational market prices, it would have to incur anadditional expenditure on higher subsidies to fill thedifferences between the actual costs and the domesticretail prices of the same. Hence, additional funds willbe necessary to provide subsidies on a continuous basis.The additional resource requirement can be met througha number of ways;-Increasing taxes in other areas: This will create anadditional burden on the tax payers and the generalpublic.-Holding back on other types of expenditures: Theprovision of subsidies would crowd out resourcesthat are available for other priority spending,especially capital expenditure. Since it is the capitalexpenditures that generate future income streams,

Box 14

the petroleum subsidy may affect the future incomegenerating capacity of the country.-Resorting to higher borrowings: If the governmentfinances oil subsidies through higher borrowings,it will either crowd out credit available for otherproductive purposes or would create inflationarypressures in the economy, if such borrowings werefrom the banking system.•Secondly, when the Government reduces or exemptstaxes on petroleum products to maintain arbitrarily lowprices in the domestic market, the Government wouldincur revenue losses, which would widen the budgetdeficit further.Accordingly, the subsidies compromise the fiscalposition of the Government by way of excessive andunpredictable outlays, and revenue losses. In addition,subsidies essentially distort market prices. The price of agood generally provides a signal to the market to ensurethe optimum allocation of limited resources. Thus, bymaking petroleum products available in the market at anartificially lower price, the Government encourages an overconsumption of petroleum products, which results in amisallocation of resources.If the Government is concerned about the poorersegments of petroleum product users, it would be moreefficient to address the issue through targeted subsidies, asblanket subsidies tend to be more expensive and misused. Ithas been found that the benefits of energy subsidies areenjoyed mostly by the non-poor (Devarajan and Ghani,2006). The cost of the subsidies will have to be financed bythe government through taxes and inflationary borrowing.Hence, ultimately, the costs of the subsidies are shared bythe general public, including the poor. Therefore, theadjustment of fuel prices could be considered as anappropriate policy measure, since any delay in adjustingprices would require more abrupt and larger adjustments ata later stage.In line with this, the government introduced a formulabased pricing mechanism to rationalize the pricing ofpetroleum products in 2003 with a view to reducing the fiscalcost. It was also expected to pass any benefit or cost arisingfrom the changes in the cost of petroleum products toconsumers in a transparent manner. However, even thoughthe international oil prices continued to rise since 2003, theadjustment of domestic petroleum prices according to thispricing formula was abandoned in 2004 and allowed only apartial pass-through on ad-hoc basis. As a result, thegovernment had to compensate oil companies withsubsidies (Chart B 14.1).

Consequently, the fiscal cost of subsidies increasedsubstantially, amounting to Rs. 18 billion in 2004, Rs. 26billion in 2005 and Rs. 9.4 billion in 2006 (Chart B 14.2).About 53 per cent of the subsidy was on diesel. The amountspent by the government as fuel subsides, particularly in2005, amounted to about 58 per cent of the expenditure onhealth and about 41 per cent of the expenditure oneducation.Meanwhile, the VAT on diesel was eliminated in August2005 and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) wasexempted from the payment of excise duty of Rs. 2.50 perlitre on diesel for power generation causing a revenue lossto the government. In addition, CEB was provided with across subsidy on diesel by supplying diesel at a lower rateuntil end December 2007.The non-adjustment of prices exerted a huge burdenon the budget, particularly in 2004 and 2005, leading tohigher government borrowings from the banking system.During these two years, higher borrowings were alsorecorded by the state owned enterprises (SOEs) such asCeylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and CEB. Higherborrowings by both, the government and SOEs, resultedin a larger monetary expansion during these years,contributing towards a build up of inflationary pressuresin the economy.Since then, CPC has improved its financial positionthrough a variety of measures. These include increasingthe efficiency of refineries, hedging oil purchases againstadverse price movements, improving its financialmanagement and internal controls, importing refinedproducts on a more competitive basis and negotiating formore favourable terms on suppliers’ credit, etc. However,it still faces cash flow problems due to an accumulation ofarrears by CEB, which continues to make losses, mainlydue to non-adjustment of electricity tariff to reflect the costsand hence, poses a threat to the budget. In order to remedythis situation, electricity tariff was revised from March2008. This would be an appropriate move as far as thefiscal cost is concerned, since evidence indicates thatdistortions arising due to non-adjustment of electricityprices could get worse unless remedial measures are taken promptly.

From July 2006, the government allowed oil distributingcompanies to adjust domestic petroleum prices in line withthe oil prices in the international market. With this, the fuelsubsidy given to CPC and Lanka Indian Oil Company Ltd.(LIOC) was discontinued with a view of reducing the fiscalcost of subsidies.In order to cushion the burden of the removal of subsidyon the poor and vulnerable groups, the governmentintroduced targeted subsidies. Accordingly, the governmenthas been providing an allowance of Rs. 100 per month as asubsidy for kerosene to Samurdhi recipients. A one offpayment of Rs. 4,000 was also made to fishing boat ownersin August 2007. The estimated cost of these measures in2007 was about Rs. 632 million. The Government alsoreduced the Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol from 15 percent to 5 per cent since January 2008, which is expected toreduce the government revenue by Rs. 7,400 million in2008. The Budget 2008 has also indicated that if thisreduction is deemed to be insufficient in the context ofchanging international oil prices, the removal of excise dutyon petrol would be considered. As the international pricesremained high, the government revised the petroleum priceson 13 January 2008 as well. Nevertheless, any benefitaccruing due to a decline in the international prices isexpected to be provided to the general public by reducingdomestic prices.An upward movement in the cost of living was observedsince mid 2007 largely due to the removal of the fuelsubsidy and increases in prices of imported food products.The pass through of international price increases, thoughit leads to a one time increase in prices, will have afavourable impact on containing future inflation byeliminating the need for subsidising same, throughexpansionary borrowings of the government.Reference:Devarajan, S. and Ejaz Ghani (2006), “Oil Price Shocks,Fiscal Adjustment and Poverty Reduction in SouthAsia”, Proceedings of the SAARCFINANCE Seminaron “Oil Price Hike: Implications for SAARCCountries”, January 20, Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

the conflict in the Eastern Province were resettled.Initial measures were taken to resettle the remainingfamilies. In addition, the provision of dry rations toconflict affected families and maintenance and upkeepof welfare centres were also continued. A “Three YearEastern Province Development Plan: 2007-2010”(Neganahira Navodaya) was initiated by thegovernment with a view of developing the EasternProvince and upgrading the living standards of thepeople in the province (Box 2).

A number of measures were introduced in thegovernment debt management front. Efforts weretaken to minimise the interest cost of the domesticborrowing programme by maintaining an appropriatemix between domestic and foreign sources offinancing. Accordingly, reducing the pressure ondomestic market interest rates and dealing withunfavourable conditions in the domestic rupeedenominated debt market were emphasised. In linewith this, the maximum limit applicable on foreigninvestments in Treasury bonds was increased to 10per cent of the outstanding Treasury bonds from theinitial limit of 5 per cent and foreign currencydenominated domestic borrowings were increased.The entry barriers for foreign investors, such as theminimum holding period of Treasury bonds, were alsoremoved.

Further measures to diversify the deficitfinancing options were introduced during 2007. Thegovernment successfully completed Sri Lanka’s debutinternational sovereign bond issue of US dollars 500million (Rs. 56 billion) in October, 2007 (Box 15). Apart of the proceeds received from this bond issue wasutilised to settle high cost borrowings made toimplement several infrastructure projects that wereincluded in Budget 2007. The diversification of thefinancing mix has become imperative in a situationwhere Sri Lanka’s per capita income is graduallyincreasing, which in turn would limit the country’saccess to concessionary foreign financing in the future.

The search for alternative methods of financingrather than relying on debt financing, gained amomentum with the government continuing toactively promote public-private partnerships(PPPs) in large infrastructure projects. ThroughPPPs, increased private sector involvement ininfrastructure development is envisaged. Accordingly,the process of selecting prospective private sectordevelopment partners for the Colombo South HarbourExpansion project was in progress. Some of theprojects such as Weerawila International Airport Projectand Colombo - Katunayake Expressway Project are

expected to be implemented as PPPs.

A new medium term debt management strategy(MTDMS) for 2007 and beyond was also formulated.This included a number of initiatives in line with thegovernment’s medium term borrowing programme andmedium term macro fiscal framework. The strategiesin MTDMS include the implementation of a debtconsolidation programme, developing a credible andliquid debt market, introducing diversified debtinstruments, restructuring primary dealer system andreducing debt financing in the budget by implementinginvestments in economic sectors through otheralternative financing methods.

The lack of financial viability in several StateTrading Enterprises (STEs) continued to be a strainon the government budget. Two major STEs namely;Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) and the Department of Posts(DOP), continued to report operating losses. The non-revision of railway fares since August 2005 and thesteep increase in international oil prices weakened thefinancial position of SLR. The DOP continued to reportoperating losses despite the revision of postal chargeswith effect from April 2007. Therefore, the governmenthad to provide a significant amount of transfers (Rs.6.6 billion) to these STEs in 2007 in order for them tocontinue their operations.

The financial performance of the key StateOwned Enterprises (SOEs), CPC and CEB, alsoremained a concern. The financial performance ofCPC was improved in the recent years mainly as aresult of the adjustment of petroleum prices in line withthe international oil prices, and improvements in thefinancial management and internal controls of CPC.However, CEB continued to operate with losses dueto a number of reasons including the increased fuelcost, delays in implementing planned reforms in theelectricity sector, inflexible pricing policy,implementation delays of the planned low-cost, large-scale power projects and the delays in addressing thehigh system losses.

6.3Government Budgetary Operations

Revenue

In 2007, the government revenue increased by18.3 per cent to Rs. 565 billion, respondingpositively to the continuous efforts made by thegovernment in the revenue front. Both tax and non-tax revenue contributed for this increase. However,total revenue collection was Rs. 35 billion below thebudgetary estimate of Rs. 600 billion, mainly due tothe provision of tax concessions on essential imported

commodities for countering the rising cost of goodsand services and the lower quantity and total value ofvehicle imports in 2007. As a per cent of GDP, itdeclined to 15.8 per cent compared to 16.3 per cent in2006. During the year, tax revenue increased by 18.9per cent to Rs. 509 billion and as a per cent of GDP, itdeclined to 14.2 per cent from 14.6 per cent in 2006.Non-tax revenue increased by 12.8 per cent to Rs. 56billion and declined marginally to 1.6 per cent of GDP.

Higher growth in income taxes (33 per cent) wasthe main driving force of the enhanced revenuefrom taxes. The improved economic activities,modernisation of tax administration, improvedenforcement and public awareness campaigns, andchanges to tax policy were attributed to the growth inincome taxes. The increase in the revenue from VAT(14 per cent) was mainly attributed to improvementsin the VAT refund mechanism and increased mark-upon CIF values for the calculation of VAT on imports.Import duties grew only by 6 per cent mainly due tothe duty waivers granted on essential food items.Among the major tax revenue sources, revenuecollection from excise duties recorded the lowestgrowth of 4 per cent when compared to the previousyear mainly due to the relatively lower growth inrevenue collection from cigarettes. This moderategrowth in the revenue from liquor and cigarettes wasmainly attributed to higher applicable excise duty rates,strict implementation of legislative provisions withregard to the abuse of excise rules and regulations,higher growth in production, intensified detections ofillicit items and government policy on controlling liquorand cigarette consumption. Meanwhile, the revenuefrom excise duties on other items, including motorvehicles, recorded a marginal decline in 2007compared to the previous year.

Several reasons were attributed to the increasein non-tax revenue. The transfer of profits from theCentral Bank, the increase in revenue from fines andforfeitures and higher profit and dividend receipts were

among the major reasons.

Expenditure and Net Lending

In 2007, total expenditure and net lending of thegovernment remained below the budgetary target.Although there was a 18 per cent increase to Rs. 842billion in the total expenditure and net lending, it wasbelow the budgetary estimate of Rs. 898 billion by Rs.56 billion mainly due to the lower than the budgetedcapital expenditure. As a per cent of GDP also, itdeclined to 23.5 per cent from 24.3 per cent in 2006.

Total recurrent expenditure, in nominal terms,exceeded the budgetary target in 2007 but declinedas a per cent of GDP compared to 2006. Therecurrent expenditure, which increased by 14 per centto Rs. 623 billion, was higher than the original targetby Rs. 26 billion. However, as a per cent of GDP, it

amounted to 17.4 per cent, which was considerablylower than 18.6 per cent recorded in 2006. The overrunin the recurrent expenditure was mainly due to theincreases in salaries and wages, pension payments,interest payments and security related expenditure.Salaries and wages increased by 22.4 per cent to Rs.214 billion mainly due to the full impact of therecruitments made under the graduate employmentscheme in 2006 and the new recruitments to the publicsector, including defence establishments, payment ofincentive allowance in lieu of leave not availed by publicofficers and higher expenditure on COLA. The shareof salaries and wages in recurrent expenditureincreased to 34.3 per cent compared with 32 per centrecorded in 2006. The increase in pension paymentsby 18.6 per cent was mainly attributed to the increasein COLA to pensioners, correction of anomalies andthe impact of the entry of around 18,000 newpensioners in 2007. The interest payments increasedby 21 per cent compared to the previous year mainlydue to the higher and more volatile interest rates thatprevailed in the domestic market and the shift ininvestor preference towards the shorter end of thematurity spectrum. Additional funds were required fordefence related activities as the government had tointensify counter terrorism measures to ensure nationalsecurity. These were mainly to meet the expenditureon salaries and wages and other needs of securitypersonnel, including the new recruits, and thereplenishment and procurement of security relatedequipment. The IDPs were provided with shelter, foodsand medical needs while developing infrastructure tocreate economic activities to bring life back to normalin the respective areas. The welfare expenditure onthe provision of free text books, season tickets,nutritional food to school children, bursaries,assistance to disabled soldiers etc., continued toincrease. The government continued to providebudgetary assistance to STEs (which include SLR andDOP) as they continued to incur operating losses.

In 2007, public investment continued toincrease. In nominal terms, it increased by 27 per centto Rs. 229 billion and as a per cent of GDP also itincreased to 6.4 per cent from 6 per cent in the previousyear. This improvement was a result of the strenuousefforts made by the government to accelerate theimplementation of development projects through localfunds and foreign aid disbursements. In particular, thegovernment took measures to ensure the availabilityof bridging financing and counterpart funds, particularlythrough the issuance of a debut international bondissue, to implement development projects as planned.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2007

Public investment in economic servicesremained high in 2007 as well. Within this sector,transport and communication, and energy and watersupply were the main areas of investment. The initialwork on mega infrastructure development projects,continuation of the development work related to roads,electricity, water supply and irrigation projects,acceleration of rural infrastructure developmentprojects and reconstruction of tsunami affected areaswere attributed to this improvement.

Public investment in social services alsoincreased in line with the government policy onhuman resource development towards a healthier

and knowledge-based economy in the medium tolong run. The share of social services was about 24per cent of the total public investment in 2007.Education and health continued to be the prioritysectors in this category. The investment in educationwas mainly in the areas of enhancing schoolinfrastructure facilities and access to education,improving the quality of the education, and developingthe institutional abilities in educational institutions.Public investment in health sector was mainly on thedevelopment of health infrastructure, particularly at theregional and rural levels, and the development ofhuman resources in the health sector.Nevertheless, the performance of the publicinvestment programme was below theexpectations due to a number of reasons. Theseincluded capacity limitations, administrative andprocurement delays, issues in land acquisition, andhigh cost of compensation and settlement etc. Thissituation calls for further efforts to complete the plannedinfrastructure projects within the stipulated periods toreduce cost escalations.

Key Fiscal Balances

The overall budget deficit declined to 7.7 percent of GDP (Rs. 277 billion) in 2007 from 8 percent recorded in the previous year. This was alsobelow the budgetary target of 8.4 per cent of GDP, asthe decline in the revenue collection and the overrunin recurrent expenditure was offset by the decline incapital expenditure and net lending. The currentaccount deficit, which measures the government dis-savings, declined further to 1.6 per cent of GDPcompared to 2.4 per cent in 2006 reflecting the highergrowth in revenue relative to recurrent expenditure.However, the original budget expected a small positivebalance in 2007. Meanwhile, the primary deficit (overalldeficit net of interest payments), which reflects theimpact of current year’s fiscal operations on themacroeconomy, also declined to 2.6 per cent from 2.9

per cent in 2006. The higher growth in revenue (18.3per cent), which outpaced the growth in non-interestexpenditure (17.1 per cent) was mainly attributed tothis improvement.

Financing the Budget Deficit

The diversification of the deficit financingoptions was continued during 2007. The debutinternational bond issue was the most recent deficitfinancing source introduced by the government.Consequently, the financing mix of the governmentbudget expanded to six sources; domestic rupee andforeign currency denominated borrowings, foreignborrowings through Treasury bonds, sovereign bondsand other loans (including concessional loans), andforeign grants.

In financing the overall budget deficit of Rs. 277billion in 2007, the amount of resources raised fromthe domestic sources was lower than the foreignresources. Total net domestic financing (NDF) wasRs.128 billion compared with the original estimate ofRs. 156.2 billion as well as Rs.164 billion recorded in2006. Net foreign financing (NFF) was Rs. 131 billioncompared to the original estimate of Rs. 142 billion in2007. This consisted of Rs. 56 billion from internationalbond issue, Rs. 37 billion from foreign investments inrupee denominated Treasury bonds, Rs. 7.4 billionfrom other foreign loans and Rs. 30.5 billion fromforeign grants. As a per cent of GDP, total NFFincreased to 3.7 per cent from 2.5 per cent in 2006while total NDF declined to 3.6 per cent from 5.6 percent. As at end 2007, an amount of Rs.17.4 billionremained to be paid. Meanwhile, the debt dependencyratio (the ratio of total net borrowings to totalgovernment expenditure) increased marginally to 29.2per cent in 2007 from 28.8 per cent in 2006.

Of the budget deficit, about 47 per cent wasfinanced through domestic sources compared to69 per cent in 2006. Within the total NDF, about 87.1per cent (Rs. 112 billion) was from domestic non-banksources, which indicated an increase of Rs. 28 billioncompared to Rs.84 billion in 2006. The major sourceof non-bank financing was the Employees’ ProvidentFund (EPF) as in the previous years.

The borrowing from banking sector declinedsignificantly in 2007 compared to 2006. The bankfinancing of Rs. 15.8 billion in 2007 recorded a sharpdecline from Rs. 80 billion in 2006, while the budgetarytarget was Rs. 16.7 billion in 2007. The increasing trendobserved in bank financing during the first threequarters of the year was eased in the last quarter withthe receipt of the proceeds from the international bondissue, as a part of it was utilised to retire Treasury billsheld by Central Bank that were issued to fund forinfrastructure projects. Total amount of bank financingin 2007 was the outcome of the net repayment of Rs.13 billion to Central Bank and borrowings of Rs. 29billion from commercial banks. In 2007, bank financingaccounted only for 12.3 per cent of the total NDFagainst that of 48.8 per cent in 2006.

Borrowings from domestic rupee denominatedinstruments accounted for 78.5 per cent of the NDFin 2007. It indicated a increase to Rs.100.2 billion fromRs. 93.9 billion in 2006. Net borrowings from debtinstruments consisted of Treasury Bonds (Rs. 52.8billion), Treasury bills (Rs. 37 billion) and Rupee loans(Rs, 10.3 billion). The amount of Treasury bondsexcludes the Rs. 37 billion (on book value basis)received from foreign investors.

The maturity structure of the borrowingsthrough domestic rupee denominated instrumentswas more towards the shorter end of the marketreflecting the investor preference in anenvironment of rising interest rates. The risinginterest rate structure fuelled by high inflation andinflationary expectations was the major factor that

shifted the investor preference to the shorter end ofthe market. The tight monetary policy measuresadopted by the Central Bank and heavy borrowingprogramme of the government were also attributed tothe rising interest rates in the market. Although somemoderation of the interest rates was experienced inthe market after the international bond issue in October2007, the trend reversed to a certain extent in the lastmonth of the year.

The reliance on foreign currency denominateddomestic borrowings continued in 2007 as ameasure to reducing the pressure on domesticmarket interest rates. There were borrowings of Rs.23.6 billion (US dollars 215.3 million) through Sri LankaDevelopment Bonds (SLDBs), while there was a netrepayment of Rs. 2.2 billion (US dollars 20.8 million)of the borrowings from Offshore Banking Units (OBUs).Moreover, some of the borrowings from OBUs wererolled over in 2007. In addition, there were foreigncurrency denominated borrowings of Rs.6.0 billion (USdollars 55 million) from National Savings Bank (NSB),including a loan of Rs. 5.4 billion (US dollars 50 million)arranged by NSB through ICICI Bank of India. A partof the proceeds from these borrowings were used torepay high interest foreign currency borrowings. As theaverage maturity of these borrowings was 2.8 years,their maturity structure needs to be lengthened to avoida bunching of repayments.

The government was able to mobilise a recordamount of foreign resources for financing thebudget deficit in 2007. On a gross basis, thegovernment received US dollars 2,036 million (Rs.224billion) from foreign sources in comparison to USdollars 1,219 million (Rs. 127.7 billion) in the previousyear. Of this, about 32 per cent was on concessionalterms while the balance was on non-concessionalterms and conditions. About 38 per cent of the totalforeign loans was received by way of project loans(US dollars 785 million) from bilateral and multilateraldevelopment partners. The government of Japan,Asian Development Bank (ADB) and InternationalDevelopment Association (IDA) were the major donorsof project loans. Meanwhile, China became anemerging development partner. Non-concessionalloans of US dollars 1,376 million raised during the yearmainly included the proceeds from the internationalbond issue and the investments in Treasury bonds byforeigners.

Total NFF was also increased substantially in2007. As the repayment of foreign loans amounted toRs.64 billion, including defence related deferredpayments of Rs. 10 billion, the NFF amounted to Rs. 131.4

billion compared to Rs.67 billion in 2006. Since therewas a substantial increase in new aid commitmentswhich will be disbursed in the next few years receivedby the government during 2007, the utilisation rate ofavailable foreign assistance declined to 21.2 per centin 2007 from 22.5 per cent in the previous year. Furtherefforts are necessary to improve the utilisation ofavailable concessional foreign financing in the future.

The amount of foreign grants received forbudgetary purposes continued to be highcompared to pre-tsunami levels. A total amount ofRs. 30.5 billion was received as foreign grants in 2007mainly from bilateral donors, such as the governmentsof Japan, Federal Republic of Germany and the USA,and multilateral agencies, such as IDA and ADB, as inthe previous years.

6.4Sub National Government BudgetaryOperations

The sub national government (SNGs) systemin Sri Lanka consists of Provincial Councils (PCs)and Local Governments (LGs). There are 9 PCsestablished under the 13th Amendment to theConstitution in the process of decentralisation of thedecision making process by the devolution of powersto PCs. Under this amendment, a Finance Commission(FC) has also been set-up with a key role ofrecommending apportionment of available resourcesamong PCs. The LG system in the country constitutedof 330 units comprising 18 Municipal Councils (MCs),42 Urban Councils (UCs) and 270 PradesheeyaSabhas (PSs) as at end 2007.

The activities of SNGs continued with resourcesobtained mainly from two sources; their ownrevenue and transfers received from the centralgovernment to finance the resource gap. Theinadequacy of the powers granted in mobilisingresources, relatively narrow tax base, weak informationsystems and limited administrative capacities made itdifficult to generate adequate revenues for them toprovide even the basic services. This revenue –expenditure gap makes these spheres of governanceheavily dependent on financial transfers from thecentral government.

SNGs rendered their services amidst severalother problems. The relatively low share of capitalexpenditure, large and increasing share of personalemoluments, shortage of trained staff in several areas,lack of strong regulation and monitoring systems andinadequate financial and human resourcemanagement were among them.

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

As in the previous years, Ministry of LocalGovernment and Provincial Councils (MLGPC)maintained a close coordination with SNGs. TheMLGPC functioned as the government agencyrepresenting SNGs at the centre. It also continued toprovide budgetary funds to ensure financial capabilityof SNGs, extended the guidance and support forstrengthening and facilitating provincial governancewhile organising various forums, conferences andworkshops to coordinate and promote developmentorientation of SNGs.

During the year, FC made an effort, incollaboration with Central Bank, for encouragingPCs to work towards achieving a balanced regionaldevelopment. Accordingly, a series of discussionswere held with PCs. As an outcome of thesedeliberations, FC was able to make allocations throughBudget 2008 for two key projects in each provincededicated for strengthening regional economy (Box 6).This pro-active role of FC needs to be continued inassociation with other stakeholders in order to reapthe expected outcome of reducing regional economicdisparity gradually.

Performance of Provincial Councils

In 2007, the overall budgetary operations of PCsimproved. Total revenue collection increased by 33per cent mainly due to the increase in revenue fromturnover taxes (TT) and stamp duties. The increase inrevenue from TT was substantial as the governmentallowed the PCs to increase the TT rate applicable ontobacco and cigarettes to 5 per cent from 1 per cent.About 87 per cent of the total revenue was collected

from the above two sources. The Western ProvincialCouncil (WPC) continued as the dominant revenuecollecting province in 2007 due to the highconcentration of commercial and industrial activitiesand the high population in this region. Total revenueof WPC accounted for 66 per cent of the total revenuecollection while Central, Southern and North Westernwere the other major revenue collecting provinces.

The recurrent expenditure of PCs increased by21 per cent in 2007 over the previous year. Therecurrent expenditure consisted of personalemoluments (80 per cent) and other expenditures (20per cent). A major portion of the personal emolumentswas absorbed by education and health sectors whileother non-wage expenses in relation to goods andservices accounted for the balance.

Investment expenditure of PCs increased in2007. Their investment expenditure was mainly inrespect of Province Specific Development Projects(PSDP) and foreign funded special projects.

In 2007, transfers from the central governmentto PCs amounted to Rs. 83 billion. These were inthe form of block grants to fund recurrent expenditureneeds, criteria based grants to fund discretionaryexpenditure requirements, matching grants to fundincentives for revenue collection of PCs and ProvinceSpecific Development Grants (PSDG) to continuePSDPs. In addition, foreign grants received by PCsfor special projects amounted to Rs. 9 billion while therewere transfers of Rs. 2.7 billion for health and educationsector development projects.

It appears that government’s attempt at fiscaldecentralisation has not yielded the desired resultsof enhancing regional growth through addressingthe needs of the people at the provincial and thelocal levels. There is a considerable overlap offunctions of PCs with those of the central government,especially with respect to providing basic education,healthcare and road facilities, wherein the decisionscontinue to be taken by the central government andthe PCs are merely functioning as the implementingagencies. This has severely affected the quality ofservices rendered by them while hampering theefficiency with which these services were delivered.Also, the limitations in financial transfers from thecentral government have resulted in a slow progressin their development activities. Hence, PCs have tocome up with renewed efforts to increase the utilisationof their own resources for the benefit of the provincialpopulation instead of relying increasingly on funds fromthe centre.

Performance of Local Governments

Local authorities financed their expendituresthrough revenues from several sources and faceda number of constraints that affected their effectivefunctioning. The revenue sources of LGs includerates, other revenue, assigned revenue (stamp dutyand court fines), and government transfers. PCsworked as the agent for LGs in collecting the twosources of devolved revenues, namely stamp duty andcourt fines, as assigned under the 13th Amendment tothe Constitution. Meanwhile, the outlays of LGscomprised of personal emoluments, other currentexpenses and capital expenses. The weak financialsystems and human resource management, lack ofcompetent technical staff, weaknesses in regulationand monitoring, lower revenue collection and lack oflegal powers continued to be the major constraints forthe effective functioning of LGs.

6.5Financial Performance of SelectedPublic Enterprises

The CPC and CEB are the two publicenterprises, which could impose a significantimpact on the government budgetary operations.During the year, the financial position of CPC improvedwhile that of CEB continued to weaken due to severalreasons.The financial position of CPC improved in 2007.This was mainly a result of the adjustment of petroleumprices in line with the international prices, andimprovements in the financial management andinternal controls (Box14), though the provision of dieseland furnace oil by CPC to CEB at a subsidised ratehad a significant impact on its financial operations. Inaddition, the entering into hedging oil purchasesagainst adverse price movements has had a positiveimpact on the financial position of CPC. With theseimprovements, CPC’s burden on the governmentbudget as fuel subsidies was gradually phased out.However, as CPC had to borrow foreign exchange fromthe banking system to settle their import bills, itsliabilities to the banking sector increased in 2007.Meanwhile, CPC received an enhanced suppliers’credit facility to the value of around US dollars 700million from Iran in January 2008, which will helpimprove its financial operations further.CEB’s financial position continued todeteriorate in 2007 as well. Despite the receipt ofdiesel and furnace oil at a subsidised rate from CPC,the increased fuel cost, delays in implementing plannedreforms in the electricity sector, inflexible pricing policy,implementation delays of the planned low cost large-

scale power projects and the delay in addressing thehigh system losses contributed to the weak financialposition of CEB. The government continued to serviceCEB’s foreign debt in 2007 as well. Nevertheless, itsliabilities to the banking system declined in 2007. Theelectricity tariff revision, which was implemented inMarch 2008, is expected to help improve the financialposition of CEB.

6.6Public Sector Debt and Debt ServicePayments

Government Debt

Total outstanding government debt increasedby 18 per cent to Rs. 3,070 billion in 2007. However,as a percent of GDP, it declined for the fifth consecutiveyear to 85.8 per cent. This was mainly due to thestabilisation of the rupee vis-a-vis major foreigncurrencies towards the end of the year and the highergrowth in nominal GDP than the growth in nominaldebt. As a per cent of GDP, both domestic and foreigndebt ratios improved to 47.9 per cent and 37.9 percent, respectively in 2007.

In nominal terms, total outstanding debtincreased by Rs. 462 billion in 2007. Of this, theincrease in total domestic debt was Rs. 236 billion andthe increase in foreign debt was Rs. 226 billion.Domestic debt increased mainly due the netborrowings and the issuance of debt instruments on adiscount basis. Increased net foreign borrowings andthe depreciation of the Rupee against major foreigncurrencies were the main reasons for the increasedforeign debt. However, the impact of exchange ratevariation at Rs. 71 billion was lower in 2007 comparedto Rs. 109 billion recorded in the previous year,reflecting the relatively lower depreciation of the Rupeevis-a-vis major foreign currencies.

Of the total domestic debt, the share of themedium to long term debt remained almostunchanged at 78.8 per cent in 2007. Treasury bondscontinued to remain as the key domestic borrowinginstrument accounting for 77.4 per cent of totaloutstanding medium to long term debt and 60 per centof the total outstanding domestic debt. Within themedium and long term debt, the share of rupeesecurities declined further to 9.7 per cent. Since therewere issues of SLDBs in 2007, the total outstandingSLDBs increased to 6.4 per cent of the total of thedomestic medium and long term debt. Meanwhile,within the total short term debt, the share of Treasurybills increased to 84 per cent due to the higher relianceon this instrument compared to other short-termborrowings.

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

In 2007, the outstanding debt liabilities to thebanking sector increased at a relatively lower rate.The increase was only Rs. 19 billion in 2007 comparedto that of Rs. 97 billion in 2006. The share of thebanking sector liabilities to total domestic outstandingdebt declined to 24.2 per cent from 26.7 per cent inthe previous year. During the year, the outstanding debtto Central Bank declined by Rs.13 billion, while thedebt held by commercial banks increased by Rs. 32billion.

The outstanding government debt held by thenon-bank sector increased by Rs. 217 billion toRs.1,300 billion. The EPF and NSB continued to bethe major investors in this category and accounted for44 per cent and 15 per cent of the domestic non bankoutstanding debt, respectively. The outstanding foreigncurrency denominated domestic debt increased toRs.180.3 billion (US dollars 1,659 million) as at end2007. Total outstanding foreign currency debtincreased marginally to 10.5 per cent of the totaldomestic debt from 10.3 per cent in the previous year.

Of the total government foreign debt, the shareof concessional debt declined to 83.3 per cent in2007 from 93 per cent in 2006. The increased foreigncommercial borrowing was the major reason for thisdecline. However, this situation is in line with thesituation of Sri Lanka as a lower middle income countrywith reduced access to concessional financing in themedium term. Nevertheless, there is a need to maintainnon-concessional borrowings at a manageable levelto minimise the adverse implications associated withthem.

As in the previous years, project loansdominated the outstanding foreign debtaccounting for 80 per cent with non-project loansaccounting for the balance. The correspondingvalues were 87 per cent and 13 per cent in 2006. Theincreased amount of commercial borrowings was themajor reason for this change. During the year, theoutstanding debt to bilateral sources declined to 43.8per cent of the total foreign debt. The governments of

Japan (24.2 per cent), Germany (7.0 per cent) andthe USA (3.9 per cent) were the major bilateraldevelopment partners. The outstanding multilateraldebt declined to 42.8 per cent of the total foreign debt.The ADB (21.3 per cent) and IDA (19.3 per cent)continued as the major multilateral developmentpartners in this category.The outstanding debt was in four major foreigncurrencies. About 37.5 per cent of the debt was inSpecial Drawing Rights (SDR). This was followed bythe Japanese yen (25 per cent), US dollars (19.7 percent) and Euro (11 per cent). The balance (6.8 percent) was in other currencies.The gradual decline in the outstanding debt toGDP ratio is encouraging. However, strong effortsare necessary to continue with this trend to accomplishthe targeted debt to GDP ratio of 60 per cent by 2013,as stipulated in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility)Act. Hence, further improvements are necessary incontaining recurrent expenditure, budget deficits,borrowings, outstanding debt and interest paymentsto further strengthen the fiscal situation. The fiscalconsolidation path, which has already been announcedby the government in its policy documents, would bethe way towards this direction.

lines increased to Rs. 60 billion, compared to Rs.45 billion in the previous year. The debt liabilities ofNFPCs to the banking system increased by Rs.17.6billion to Rs. 49.2 billion. Two SOEs, namely CEB andCPC, accounted for 93.6 per cent of the total

outstanding NFPC debt to the banking system. Theoutstanding balance of the Indian line of credit obtainedby CPC was Rs.10.4 billion (US dollars 96 million) byend 2007.

Public Sector Debt

Total outstanding public sector debt, whichincludes the outstanding government debt,liabilities of NFPCs to the banking system, and theoutstanding balance of credit lines, increased byRs. 477 billion to Rs. 3,130 billion at end 2007.Theincreases recorded in both government debt by Rs.462 billion and NFPCs debt by Rs. 15 billion wereattributed to this growth. As a per cent of GDP, theoutstanding public sector debt, as defined in thissection, declined further to 87.5 per cent as at end2007 from 90.3 per cent at end 2006.

Debt Service Payments

In 2007, total debt service payments increasedby 12.6 per cent to Rs. 500.5 billion. This consistedof loan repayments of Rs. 317.8 billion (63.5 per cent)and interest payments of Rs. 182.7 billion (36.5 percent). Debt service payments to domestic sourcesamounted to Rs. 415 billion, while that for foreignsources was Rs. 85.5 billion. The domestic loanrepayments increased at a lower rate in 2007 as apart of the foreign currency denominated domesticborrowings which fell due in 2007 were rolled over.However, domestic interest payments exceeded theoriginal estimate by Rs. 13.6 billion in 2007 due tohigher domestic market interest rates. Foreign debtservice payments included four instalments (Rs. 8.4billion) of interest and repayments, which werepostponed under the voluntary debt moratoriumreceived in 2005. It also included the repayment ofdefence loans, which had been obtained underdeferred conditions.

Some debt service indicators continued toimprove in 2007 as well. The ratio of total debt servicepayments to government revenue declined to 88.6 percent from 93 per cent in 2006. Total debt service as aper cent of GDP also declined to 14.0 per cent from15.1 per cent in the previous year. Total interestpayments as a per cent of GDP remained unchangedat 5.1 per cent. However, the ratio of total foreign debtservice payments to exports of goods and servicesincreased to 8.2 per cent in 2007 from 7.1 per cent in2006. Nevertheless, the debt service payments remainat a comfortable level given the relatively concessionalnature of the foreign debt with long repayment periodsand continuous growth in earnings from export ofgoods and services.

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

The Government of Sri Lanka issued its debut US dollardenominated international sovereign bonds in theinternational market in October 2007 to mobilize US dollars500 million from international investors. The main purposeof the bond issue was to finance Sri Lanka Government’sstake in development partner-funded major infrastructureprojects and provide bridging finance to ensure timely andsmooth implementation of such projects. Developmentpartners do not finance 100 per cent of the project costsrelating to infrastructure projects. They usually financearound 70 per cent of the project cost, and that too, in stages.Therefore, the government, has to fund about 30 per centof the project cost, as its stake and, in many instances,provide bridging finance to ensure timely implementationof the projects, as many project loans are disbursed orreimbursed on an expenditure basis.

In view of the urgent need to implement severalinfrastructure projects in a timely manner, and therebyminimise cost escalations and support higher economic

growth, the bond issue was considered as an importantsource of financing.

Advantages and risks associated with sovereign bondissues

With the bond issue, Sri Lanka has marked its presencein the global financial market and enhanced its access tothe market which is particularly useful in view of thedeclining access by Sri Lanka to concessional financingfrom the World Bank and ADB with its achievement ofmiddle income status. It also provides a good opportunityfor the Sri Lanka authorities to convey the Sri Lanka’scredit story to the international investor community.

Another advantage is that the funds mobilized throughthe bond issue could be invested by the government inany key projects on a priority basis without conditionsbeing attached to the funding of projects. Such a situationwill be quite unlike in the case of projects financed by thedevelopment partners, where the government has to adhere

The government debt management strategy,which was formulated in 2007, has to beimplemented without further delay to improve thedebt management process. In implementing thisstrategy, emphasis has to be made on smootheningthe maturity profile of the domestic debt to minimisethe pressure on government fiscal operations. It is alsonecessary to encourage and promote alternative deficit

to numerous conditions including conditions onprocurement of goods and services from the selectedcountries or organizations. Those types of conditions areoften not financially beneficial and, in fact, in manyinstances even offset the apparent benefit that is seen asbeing derived from the concessionary interest rate chargedby the development partner, or the longer tenure of the loan.

The bond issue has established a benchmark referencerate which would enable the private sector to mobilize fundsin the international markets at competitive rates throughthe issuance of corporate bonds.

The main risk associated with a bond that has a singlebullet repayment is that a large sum of money has to bepaid out in one payment on a fixed future date, when therepayment becomes due. However, such risk could alwaysbe addressed quite adequately, by ensuring that overall debtratios continue to improve so that the repayment of suchdebt would not be a major burden in the future. Moreover,in the case of the issue under reference, the proceeds of theissue were used for financing infrastructure projects whichwould lead to higher economic activities, thereby enhancingthe repayment capacity through increased tax revenue.

Outcome of the Bond Issue

Sri Lanka successfully completed the debut internationalbond issue of a benchmark size of US dollars 500 millionin October 2007. The bond issue was oversubscribed withtotal subscription amounting to 3.2 times the offer (overUS dollars 1.6 billion). The bond has a maturity period of 5years and carries a coupon rate of 8.25 per cent per annum.The issue was distributed among investors in Asia (30 percent), Europe and the Middle East (30 per cent), and theUSA (40 per cent). It attracted 136 investors comprising ofAsset Managers (53 per cent), Banks (25 per cent),Insurance/Pension Funds (7 per cent), Retail/Private Banks(5 per cent) and other funds (10 per cent). The country’ssound economic fundamentals, conducive investmentclimate and future growth potentials and the unblemisheddebt servicing record played a major role in the success ofthe bond which was issued at a time when the globalfinancial markets were in turmoil due to sub-prime issue.The bond issue was adjudicated as the ‘Best Sovereign Bondof the Year’ by three international financial magazines,namely, Asiamoney, Finance Asia and Asset Magazine onthe ground that even being a debut, the issue wasoversubscribed by several fold despite the US sub-primecrisis that completely changed the market conditions.

Use of Bond Proceeds

During January to October, 2007, the Government hadinvested approximately Rs. 28 billion on account of a largenumber of infrastructure development projects, includingthe Hambantota Sea Port, Puttalam Coal Power, UpperKotmale Hydropower, Southern Highway, NationalHighways, Water Sector, Walawe Left Bank Irrigation andExtension, Secondary Towns and Rural Community WaterSanitation, Moragahakanda, Weheragala, and several otherirrigation and provincial development projects. Such sumshad been expended in accordance with the amountsearmarked as per the Budget 2007 and had been temporarilyfinanced through Bank borrowings, Treasury bills andTreasury bonds.

Of the Rs. 56 billion (US$ 500 million) bond proceeds,approximately Rs. 20 billion was used to settle Bankborrowings,which were used for financing infrastructureprojects during the first ten months of the year. and anotherRs. 8 billion was used for the retirement of Treasury bills.A further sum of Rs. 6 billion was utilized to settle paymentsfalling due in November 2007 in relation to the above statedongoing infrastructure projects. As a prudential debtmanagement strategy, the Government has also utilized thebalance sum of approximately Rs. 22 billion to reduce theTreasury bill stock, in order to gain the advantage of theinterest rate differential while having the option of issuingTreasury bills as and when funds are required to meet thefuture funding requirements of the infrastructure projects.

Accordingly, the bond issue did not increase the overalldebt burden above the desirable level, as it was used tosettle more expensive domestic debt that was raised tofinance infrastructure during the year. It also helpedimprove the stability of both interest rates and exchangerates.

Future Direction

With Sri Lanka’s limited access to concessionaryforeign financing in the future, international sovereignbonds will be an important debt instrument to mobilizeforeign funds in the international markets. As short-termmaturity would lead to bunching of loan repayments andincrease the external vulnerability, it would be prudent toissue future sovereign bonds with longer maturity periods.This, in turn, would warrant maintaining soundmacroeconomic fundamentals to contain the yield at areasonable level.
