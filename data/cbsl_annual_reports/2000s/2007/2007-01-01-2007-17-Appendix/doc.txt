(a) A series with a wide coverage and 1997 as the base year. In order to accommodate the variability arising from a monthly frequency, in computing the monthly trade indices, first the volume index iscomputed as a Laspeyres index and then the unit value index is derived as the ratio between the value index and the volume index. This methodology avoids the subjective imputation of prices that wouldbe required in deriving a price index first when certain items are not exported or imported in a particular month.(b) Provisional.

(a) This monetary survey is based on the aggregate data pertaining to both Domestic Banking Units (DBUs)and Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) of banks operating in Sri Lanka.Definitional changes have been adopted in aggregating DBUs and OBUs data to avoid double counting andmisclassification of assets and liabilities. The major changes are:(1) All DBU placements in OBUs are recorded as domestic assets, while all DBU borrowings from OBUs arerecorded as domestic liabilities.(2) Foreign currency deposits of DBUs are classified on the basis of ownership rather than on the basis ofcurrency. Hence, the following apply:(i) One half (50 per cent) of NRFC deposits are treated as domestic deposit liabilities;(ii) All RNNFC balances are treated as foreign liabilities;

(a)This financial survey is based on the aggregate data pertaining to Domestic Banking Units (DBUs)and Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) of commercial banks, Licenced Specailised Banks (LSBs) andRegistered Finance Companies (RFCs) operating in Sri Lanka.

Definitional changes have been adopted in aggregating DBUs, OBUs, LSBs and FINCOs data toavoid double counting and misclassification of assets and liabilities. The major changes are:

(1)All DBU placements in OBUs are recorded as domestic assets, while all DBU borrowings fromOBUs are recorded as domestic liabilities.

(2)Foreign currency deposits of DBUs are classified on the basis of ownership rather than on thebasis of currency. Hence, the following apply:

(i)One half (50 per cent) of NRFC deposits are treated as domestic deposit liabilities;

Currently, only commercial banks are subject to reserve requirements. The rate applicable (with effect from 19.10.2001) is 10 per cent of their all the rupee deposit liabilites. With effect from 24 January1992 an amount of till cash over and above two per centum of the total deposit liabilities, but not exceeding four per centum, could be maintained as a part of required reserves in the form of Sri Lanka currency notes andcoins. Details of required reserve ratios which were applicable in the past and computational methods have been published in the Appendix table on ‘Reserve Position of Commercial Banks’ in the Annual Reports prior to2003.

(b) Reserves data are for the last reserve week of each month. The required reserves recorded in the table refer to the cumulative reserves for the week, while commercial bank deposits with the Central Bank are the cumulativedeposits for that particular reserve week. Excess/Deficit on SRR is the difference between the cumulative SRR for the reserve week and cumulative deposits of the commercial banks for the week.

(c) Excludes interbank deposits.

(d) With effect from 03 April 2003, the basis of computing the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) was changed from deposit liabilites and vault cash balances at the close of business on Wednesday of the previous reserveweek, to the average of deposit liabilites and vault cash balances during the week ending Tuesday of the previous reserve week.
