Dear Sir/Madam

THE ADOPTION OF BASEL II CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK

BEGINNING 2008

As announced in the “Road Map: Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2007 and Beyond”, released by theCentral Bank on January 2, 2007, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has issued the Directions on themaintenance of capital adequacy ratios under the BASEL II for licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and licensed specialisedbanks (LSBs), in terms of the provisions under Section 46 (1) and 76J (1), of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, respectively,which will be effective from January 1, 2008. These Directions have been prepared on the basis of the “InternationalConvergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards – a Revised Framework”, widely known as Basel II, issuedby the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in June 2004 and revisedthereafter in June 2006.

2The Adoption of the Basel IIAs you are aware, Basel II provides a “three pillar” approach, i.e., (1) Minimum Capital Requirements; (2) SupervisoryReview Process; and (3) Market Discipline, for the implementation of this framework. However, as announced at theBank Managers’ Meeting held on November 22, 2007, the Central Bank has decided to adopt Pillar 1, i.e., “MinimumCapital Requirements””effective from 1st January 2008 and to adopt the other two pillars in the medium term. Theapproach for adoption of Basel II is as follows.2.1 The Adoption of Pillar I: Minimum Capital RequirementsThe Basel II framework provides several options for the implementation of the Pillar I, based on the level ofsophistication and development of the banking system. Accordingly, all LCBs and all LSBs are required to applythe Standardised Approach for credit risk, the Standardised Measurement Method for market risk and the BasicIndicator Approach for operational risk, in computing the capital requirements, commencing January 1, 2008.For this purpose, the following documents are attached herewith.(i) Banking Act Directions No. 9 (for LCBs) and 10 (for LSBs) dated 26.12.2007 issued by the Monetary Board.(ii) Guidelines on computation of capital adequacy ratio (Schedule I).*

(iii) Return to be submitted on capital adequacy ratio (Schedule II).*

2.2 Migration to Advanced ApproachesThe Central Bank has decided to move to adopting the internal ratings based (IRB) advanced approaches beginning2013. Once the Central Bank is satisfied that the banks have the appropriate models and risk management systemscapacities, permission will be granted for them to proceed with the IRB approaches. Separate guidelines in thisregard will be issued later, specifying the pre-requisites and procedures for seeking the Central Bank’s priorapproval for such migration.

2.3 Resource Requirements: Data, IT Needs and TrainingData and IT Needs: Banks should begin preparing a comprehensive data capturing system to identify, measureand report all material risks and to assess and allocate capital against these risks in a systematic and objectivemanner to meet the requirements under the simplified approaches and to move to advanced approaches in thefuture. Accordingly, banks are required to implement changes, especially plan for systems integration, modificationsto internal systems and use of new software for appropriate data collection, to move to the advanced approaches.In this regard, Banks are expected to have in place, or be actively developing, a data “warehouse”, that is, aprocess that enables a bank to collect, store and draw upon loss statistics in an efficient manner over time. Guidelinesin this regard are given in Annex I.*

Training: Upgrading skills in the areas of credit risk models and capital assessment strategies, credit risk mitigationtechniques and measuring market and operational risks will be critical to the successful implementation of BaselII.

2.4 Adoption of the other two Pillars2.4.1The Pillar II: Supervisory Review Process (SRP)The objective of SRP is to ensure that banks have adequate capital to support all material risks in theirbusiness and also to encourage them to adopt more sophisticated risk management techniques for monitoringand managing all risks. For this purpose, banks are required to establish well-defined internal assessmentprocesses within themselves in order to determine the additional capital requirement for all material risks,internally, and which would also be able to assure the Central Bank that adequate capital is actually heldtowards all their material risk exposures. However, considering the current level of internal systems of thebanks, it has been decided to adopt the Pillar II from 2010.

2.4.2The Pillar III: Market DisciplineThe introduction of disclosure requirements for banks, based on the revised framework, will be initiatedalong with the adoption of new international accounting standards, i.e., the International Financial ReportingStandards (IFRS 7). Accordingly, banks are advised to continue with the current disclosure requirementsuntil the adoption of the Pillar III.Yours faithfullyB D W A SilvaActg. Director of Bank Supervision

In the exercise of the powers conferred by Section 46(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, last amended by theBanking Act No. 46 of 2006, the Monetary Board hereby issues the following Directions on Corporate Governance forLicensed Commercial Banks in Sri Lanka. These Directions may be cited as the Banking Act Direction No. 11 of 2007.The Sections referred to in these Directions will be those of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, last amended by the BankingAct No. 46 of 2006.

1.Responsibilities and Empowerment under the Banking Act and the Monetary Law Act

1(1)In terms of Section 46(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 last amended by No. 46 of 2006, in order to ensure thesoundness of the banking system, the Monetary Board has been empowered to issue Directions to licensedcommercial banks, regarding the manner in which any aspect of the business of such banks is to be conducted.

1(2)In terms of Section 5 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is charged with theduty of securing, as far as possible by action authorised by such Act, the two objectives, namely, (a) economic andprice stability and (b) financial system stability.

1(3)In terms of Section 10(c) of the Monetary Law Act, the Monetary Board, in the exercise of its powers, duties,functions and responsibilities, is empowered to make such rules and regulations as the Monetary Board may considernecessary, in relation to any matter affecting or connected with or incidental to the exercise, discharge, or performanceof the powers, functions, and duties of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

1(4)Under the provisions of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the supervision of banks has been made a duty ofthe Central Bank on account of specific reasons as stated in John Exter’s Report on the Monetary Law Act whichstates, inter alia, as follows: “Banking is an economic activity which affects the public welfare to an unusualdegree; it touches in one way or another, almost every phase of a country’s economic life. Sound banking isessential to healthy and vigorous economic development. Supervision of banks helps to protect the public againstmismanagement, bank failures, and loss of confidence in the banking system. It helps to protect depositors andstock-holders against loss and frequently enables bank directors and officers to manage the affairs of their banksmore wisely and intelligently.”

1(5)Accordingly, in order to enhance the overall banking sector stability which is the fundamental to financial systemstability, the Monetary Board, hereby issues Directions under Section 46(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 toimprove and sustain the corporate governance processes and practices of the licensed commercial banks in SriLanka.

1(6)For purposes of this Direction, Corporate Governance processes and practices shall be deemed to be the managementframework that facilitates the conduct of the banking business in a responsible and accountable manner so as topromote the safety and soundness of the individual banks, thereby leading to the stability of the overall bankingsector.

1(7)The rules of corporate governance as contained in Direction 3 of these Directions have, therefore, been developedon the basis of certain fundamental principles as set out in Direction 2 of these Directions with a view to facilitatingthe underlying supervisory responsibilities of the Central Bank and to promote safety and soundness of the bankingsystem.

2.The Principles upon which the rules of Corporate Governance have been based upon and developed are thefollowing:

The principles set out in this Direction 2 should be referred to for explanatory purposes and/or for clarificationpurposes only, so as to understand the rationale for the rules as contained in Direction 3 hereof. Hence, strictcompliance under these Directions shall only be in respect of the rules that are set out under Direction 3.

2(1)Principle: The Responsibilities of the Board

2(1)(i)The board of directors should assume the overall responsibility and accountability in respect of: (a) themanagement of the affairs of the bank, i.e., conduct of business and maintenance of prudent risk managementmechanisms; and (b) the safety and soundness of the bank.

2(1)(ii)Towards this end, the board should: (a) determine the structure of the management of affairs of the bank; (b)delegate business operations to key management personnel led by the chief executive officer designated by theboard; (c) assume policy making and risk management for the business; and (d) ensure the effective role of thekey management personnel. Key management personnel shall mean such key executives of the bank as definedin the International Accounting Standards.

2(1)(iii)The overall responsibility of the board should not be construed as an obligation to undertake the inspection ofday-to-day activities, but should rather be understood as an obligation to oversee and ensure that the keymanagement personnel are carrying out the day-to-day activities of the bank in a safe and sound manner inaccordance with the policies set by the board.

2(1)(iv)Directors should understand the business and risk management mechanism of the bank and take objectivedecisions in the interest of the bank’s depositors, creditors, shareholders and other stakeholders. Further, theyshould ensure that the bank does not act in a manner that is detrimental or prejudicial to the interests of, andobligations to, depositors and creditors.

2(1)(v)The board should take the responsibility for compliance with accepted rules of corporate governance. Theyshould also ensure compliance with all regulatory and supervisory requirements. Further, they should ensurethat an effective combination of professionals with practical experience in relevant subjects such as banking,finance, economics, business management, human resource management, law, marketing, information technologyor any other discipline relevant or complementary to banking operations, is available in the bank to undertakeits operations and discharge its responsibilities.

2(1)(vi)The directors should be aware of potential civil and criminal liabilities that may arise from their failure todischarge their duties diligently. They should also understand that they should act with due care and prudence.In addition, the directors of state owned banks should be aware of the additional liabilities that arise from thestatus of such banks being state enterprises and consequently being accountable to the public. It is, therefore,necessary that directors commit sufficient time and energy to fulfilling the board’s responsibilities in managingthe affairs of the bank in a prudent manner.

2(2)Principle: The Board’s composition

2(2)(i)The board should be composed of a healthy mix of executive directors and non-executive directors. Some ofthe non-executive directors should also be independent so that there is strong independent element brought intothe decision-making process.

2(2)(ii)The board’s composition should ensure a balance of skills and experience as may be deemed appropriate anddesirable for the requirements of the bank.

2(2)(iii)The banking industry worldwide is making tremendous progress and undergoing rapid change with newinnovations, instruments, technologies, products, systems and processes being introduced regularly. It is vitaltherefore, that the directors should be persons who would: (a) be able to keep abreast with these changes, and(b) provide continuous contribution and guidance to the board decision-making process.

2(2)(iv)There should be a gradual infusion of new ideas into the board. There should also be assurance that therelationships between the directors amongst themselves as well as between the directors and the key managementpersonnel is at a level that does not suggest the existence of excessive familiarity, undue influence or coercion.In this context, it should be noted that very long-standing relationships could sometimes impair the high senseof values, independence and objectivity that is needed in the discharge of the duties of a director of a bank.

2(3)Principle: Criteria to assess the Fitness and Propriety of Directors

2(3)(i)In addition to the principles under the board’s composition in’Direction 2(2) above, directors should be fit andproper persons in order to be eligible to hold office as directors of a bank and no person should serve as adirector unless such person is a fit and proper person.

2(3)(ii)There is strong need for commitment and effective contribution to the prudent management of the affairs of thebank. It is very likely that the effectiveness of such commitment and contribution would tend to decrease withadvanced age of directors and more particularly, if the age of such drector is well beyond the normal age ofretirement, as generally accepted in the country.

2(4)Principle: Management functions delegated by the Board

2(4)(i)The board should have a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. The board shouldalso give clear directions to key management personnel, as to the matters that should be approved by the boardbefore decisions are made by key management personnel, on behalf of the bank.

2(5)Principle: The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer

2(5)(i)There are two key aspects of the management of every bank, viz., (a) the overall governance by the board, and(b) the day-to-day management of the bank’s business by the CEO, in line with board approved strategicobjectives, corporate values, overall risk policy and risk management procedures.

2(5)(ii)There should be a clear division of these responsibilities at the board level and the executive management levelto ensure a greater balance of power and authority, so that powers are not concentrated in any one individual.

2(5)(iii)The board should appoint a chairman as well as a chief executive officer. The division of responsibilities betweenthe chairman and chief executive officer should be clearly established and set out in writing.

2(6)Principle: Board appointed Committees

2(6)(i)The board should appoint separate board committees for audit, selection, remuneration, integrated riskmanagement and such other subjects as determined by the Board to ensure its oversight and control over theaffairs of the bank.

2(6)(ii)Where the board appoints a committee, it should set out the authority of the committee, and in particular,whether the committee has the authority to act on behalf of the board or simply has the authority to examine aparticular issue and report back to the board with recommendations.

2(6)(iii)Each committee should be chaired by a non-executive director who has some expertise in the relevant subject,and who preferably should be independent too. The majority of the members of the board committee shouldconsist of non-executive directors with at least one independent director in the committee. If a need arises,professionals from outside may be invited or hired to serve in a committee. Bank staff may be present at theboard committees for advice or special assignments, on invitation.

2(7)Principle: Related party transactions

2(7)(i)The board should ensure that the bank does not engage in transactions with “related parties” in a manner thatwould grant such parties “more favourable treatment” than that accorded to other constituents of the bankcarrying on the same business.

2(8)Principle: Disclosures

2(8)(i)The objective of disclosure is the transparency of information relating to affairs and risk management of bankswhich would help to promote market discipline of the respective banks.

2(8)(ii)Since market disclosure is the focus of the Pillar III of the risk management based capital standard known asBasel II recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at the Bank for International Settlements,(which is the globally accepted body on introducing international standards on Bank Supervision), the extent ofdisclosures should be commensurate with the size, ownership structure, systemic importance, risk profile andthe business model of the bank. Accordingly, it should be noted that the adequate and timely public disclosureof relevant information by banks would facilitate enhanced market discipline and lead to better and more effectivecorporate governance.

DIRECTIONSBANKING ACT DIRECTION NO. 12 OF 2007

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FORLICENSED SPECIALISED BANKS IN SRI LANKA

In the exercise of the powers conferred by Section 76J(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, last amended by the BankingAct No. 46 of 2006, the Monetary Board hereby issues the following Directions on Corporate Governance for LicensedSpecialised Banks in Sri Lanka. These Directions may be cited as the Banking Act Direction No. 12 of 2007. The Sectionsreferred to in these Directions will be those of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, last amended by the Banking Act No. 46of 2006.

1.Responsibilities and Empowerment under the Banking Act and the Monetary Law Act

1(1)In terms of Section 76J(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 last amended by No. 46 of 2006, the MonetaryBoard has been empowered to issue Directions to licensed specialised banks or to any category of licensedspecialised banks, regarding the manner in which any aspect of the business of such banks is to be conducted.

1(2)In terms of Section 5 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is charged withthe duty of securing, as far as possible by action authorised by such Act, the two objectives, namely, (a) economicand price stability and (b) financial system stability.

1(3)In terms of Section 10(c) of the Monetary Law Act, the Monetary Board, in the exercise of its powers, duties,functions and responsibilities, is empowered to make such rules and regulations as the Monetary Board mayconsider necessary, in relation to any matter affecting or connected with or incidental to the exercise, discharge,or performance of the powers, functions, and duties of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

1(4)Under the provisions of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the supervision of banks has been made a dutyof the Central Bank on account of specific reasons as stated in John Exter’s Report on the Monetary Law Actwhich states, inter alia, as follows: “Banking is an economic activity which affects the public welfare to anunusual degree; it touches in one way or another, almost every phase of a country’s economic life. Soundbanking is essential to healthy and vigorous economic development. Supervision of banks helps to protect thepublic against mismanagement, bank failures, and loss of confidence in the banking system. It helps to protectdepositors and stock-holders against loss and frequently enables bank directors and officers to manage theaffairs of their banks more wisely and intelligently.”

1(5)Accordingly, in order to enhance the overall banking sector stability which is the fundamental to financialsystem stability, the Monetary Board, hereby issues Directions under Section 76J(1) of the Banking Act No. 30of 1988 to improve and sustain the corporate governance processes and practices of the licensed specialisedbanks in Sri Lanka.

1(6)For purposes of this Direction, Corporate Governance processes and practices shall be deemed to be themanagement framework that facilitates the conduct of the banking business in a responsible and accountablemanner so as to promote the safety and soundness of the individual banks, thereby leading to the stability of theoverall banking sector.

1(7)The rules of corporate governance as contained in Direction 3 of these Directions have, therefore, been developedon the basis of certain fundamental principles as set out in Direction 2 of these Directions with a view tofacilitating the underlying supervisory responsibilities of the Central Bank and to promote safety and soundnessof the banking system.

2.The Principles upon which the rules of Corporate Governance have been based upon and developed arethe following:

(xliii)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2007

2

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2007

Part III

The principles set out in this Direction 2 should be referred to for explanatory purposes and/or forclarification purposes only, so as to understand the rationale for the rules as contained in Direction 3hereof. Hence, strict compliance under these Directions shall only be in respect of the rules that are setout under Direction 3.

2(1)Principle: The Responsibilities of the Board

2(1)(i)The board of directors should assume the overall responsibility and accountability in respect of: (a) themanagement of the affairs of the bank, i.e., conduct of business and maintenance of prudent risk managementmechanisms; and (b) the safety and soundness of the bank.

2(1)(ii)Towards this end, the board should: (a) determine the structure of the management of affairs of the bank; (b)delegate business operations to key management personnel led by the chief executive officer designated by theboard; (c) assume policy making and risk management for the business; and (d) ensure the effective role of thekey management personnel. Key management personnel shall mean such key executives of the bank as definedin the International Accounting Standards.

2(1)(iii)The overall responsibility of the board should not be construed as an obligation to undertake the inspection ofday-to-day activities, but should rather be understood as an obligation to oversee and ensure that the keymanagement personnel are carrying out the day-to-day activities of the bank in a safe and sound manner inaccordance with the policies set by the board.

2(1)(iv)Directors should understand the business and risk management mechanism of the bank and take objectivedecisions in the interest of the bank’s depositors, creditors, shareholders and other stakeholders. Further, theyshould ensure that the bank does not act in a manner that is detrimental or prejudicial to the interests of, andobligations to, depositors and creditors.

2(1)(v)The board should take the responsibility for compliance with accepted rules of corporate governance. Theyshould also ensure compliance with all regulatory and supervisory requirements. Further, they should ensurethat an effective combination of professionals with practical experience in relevant subjects such as banking,finance, economics, business management, human resource management, law, marketing, information technologyor any other discipline relevant or complementary to banking operations, is available in the bank to undertakeits operations and discharge its responsibilities.

2(1)(vi)The directors should be aware of potential civil and criminal liabilities that may arise from their failure todischarge their duties diligently. They should also understand that they should act with due care and prudence.In addition, the directors of state owned banks should be aware of the additional liabilities that arise from thestatus of such banks being state enterprises and consequently being accountable to the public. It is, therefore,necessary that directors commit sufficient time and energy to fulfilling the board’s responsibilities in managingthe affairs of the bank in a prudent manner.

2(2)Principle: The Board’s composition

2(2)(i)The board should be composed of a healthy mix of executive directors and non-executive directors. Some ofthe non-executive directors should also be independent so that there is strong independent element brought intothe decision-making process.

2(2)(ii)The board’s composition should ensure a balance of skills and experience as may be deemed appropriate anddesirable for the requirements of the bank.

2(2)(iii)The banking industry worldwide is making tremendous progress and undergoing rapid change with newinnovations, instruments, technologies, products, systems and processes being introduced regularly. It is vitaltherefore, that the directors should be persons who would: (a) be able to keep abreast with these changes, and(b) provide continuous contribution and guidance to the board decision-making process.

2(2)(iv)There should be a gradual infusion of new ideas into the board. There should also be assurance that therelationships between the directors amongst themselves as well as between the directors and the key managementpersonnel is at a level that does not suggest the existence of excessive familiarity, undue influence or coercion.In this context, it should be noted that very long-standing relationships could sometimes impair the high senseof values, independence and objectivity that is needed in the discharge of the duties of a director of a bank.

2(3)Principle: Criteria to assess the Fitness and Propriety of Directors

2(3)(i)In addition to the principles under the board’s composition in’Direction 2(2) above, directors should be fit andproper persons in order to be eligible to hold office as directors of a bank and no person should serve as adirector unless such person is a fit and proper person.

2(3)(ii)There is strong need for commitment and effective contribution to the prudent management of the affairs of thebank. It is very likely that the effectiveness of such commitment and contribution would tend to decrease withadvanced age of directors and more particularly, if the age of such drector is well beyond the normal age ofretirement, as generally accepted in the country.

2(4)Principle: Management functions delegated by the Board

2(4)(i)The board should have a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. The board shouldalso give clear directions to key management personnel, as to the matters that should be approved by the boardbefore decisions are made by key management personnel, on behalf of the bank.

2(5)Principle: The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer

2(5)(i)There are two key aspects of the management of every bank, viz., (a) the overall governance by the board, and(b) the day-to-day management of the bank’s business by the CEO, in line with board approved strategicobjectives, corporate values, overall risk policy and risk management procedures.

2(5)(ii)There should be a clear division of these responsibilities at the board level and the executive management levelto ensure a greater balance of power and authority, so that powers are not concentrated in any one individual.

2(5)(iii)The board should appoint a chairman as well as a chief executive officer. The division of responsibilities betweenthe chairman and chief executive officer should be clearly established and set out in writing.

2(6) Principle: Board appointed Committees

2(6)(i) The board should appoint separate board committees for audit, selection, remuneration, integrated risk managementand such other subjects as determined by the Board to ensure its oversight and control over the affairs of thebank.

2(6)(ii)Where the board appoints a committee, it should set out the authority of the committee, and in particular,whether the committee has the authority to act on behalf of the board or simply has the authority to examine aparticular issue and report back to the board with recommendations.

2(6)(iii) Each committee should be chaired by a non-executive director who has some expertise in the relevant subject,and who preferably should be independent too. The majority of the members of the board committee shouldconsist of non-executive directors with at least one independent director in the committee. If a need arises,professionals from outside may be invited or hired to serve in a committee. Bank staff may be present at theboard committees for advice or special assignments, on invitation.

2(7)Principle: Related party transactions

2(7)(i)The board should ensure that the bank does not engage in transactions with “related parties” in a manner thatwould grant such parties “more favourable treatment” than that accorded to other constituents of the bankcarrying on the same business.

2(8)Principle: Disclosures

2(8)(i)The objective of disclosure is the transparency of information relating to affairs and risk management of bankswhich would help to promote market discipline of the respective banks.

2(8)(ii) Since market disclosure is the focus of the Pillar III of the risk management based capital standard known asBasel II recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at the Bank for International Settlements,(which is the globally accepted body on introducing international standards on Bank Supervision), the extent ofdisclosures should be commensurate with the size, ownership structure, systemic importance, risk profile andthe business model of the bank. Accordingly, it should be noted that the adequate and timely public disclosureof relevant information by banks would facilitate enhanced market discipline and lead to better and more effectivecorporate governance.

GUIDELINES FOR EMPLOYMENT OF EXPATRIATE STAFF IN BANKS

1Current Policy

1.1At present, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) recommends to Immigration and Emigration Departmentresident visas for expatriate staff of foreign banks to enable the banks to employ them as follows.

(i)Maximum of three officers without any restriction.

(ii)Permission for any officers exceeding 3 is granted on a case-by-case-basis for a specific period notexceeding one year subject to condition that local staff should be trained to handle the work initiated/undertaken by such expatriate officers.

1.2The objective of developing this policy is to provide local staff with the training and opportunities to take onpositions held by the expatriate officers.

1.3In the case of local banks, there has not been such a policy since local banks generally do not employ foreignpersonnel. However, four local banks have employed foreign consultants to undertake specific assignments.

2Need for a Revision of the Policy

The following factors are considered favourably to relax the current policy to permit more expatriate officers andto encourage domestic banks to employ foreign experts.

(i)Expansion of business operations of some foreign banks.

(ii)Foreign banks now tend to expand business in Sri Lanka, especially infrastructure projects, through fundsborrowed from their respective head offices and branches.

(iii)The active presence of foreign banks with internationally experienced professionals will help improve SriLanka’s image and investment promotion internationally.

(iv)Tendency to introduce international banking products such as securitization, loan syndication, foreign loanraising, infrastructure funding and derivative products.

(v)Banks in Sri Lanka mainly depend on conventional deposit and loan products. Introduction of innovativebanking products indicate the development of the financial sector and the economy. International bankingknow-how is necessary to introduce new banking products, especially to attract foreign capital to Sri Lanka.

(vi)Banks will need to employ risk management specialists to implement advanced approaches of Basel II inthe medium term and there may be a need to look for such specialists from countries which implement BaselII.

(vii)The proposed adoption of IAS/IFRS also will require bankers who have practical experience in adoptingIAS/IFRS.

(viii)In general, banking industry needs experts who have global banking experience if Sri Lankan banks are tointroduce modern banking products, technology and risk management techniques.

3Policy Guidelines

3.1For Foreign Banks

(i)The maximum number of expatriate officers permitted will be as follows:

(a)3 for banks whose staff strength is less than 75.(b)5 for banks with staff strength of 75 to 400.(c)10 for banks with staff strength of more than 400.

(ii)In the case of Indian banks, agreement as per on-going negotiations of the Comprehensive EconomicPartnership Agreement (CEPA) will be adopted as the minimum criteria.

(lviii)

(v)In the case of expatriate officers under the normal quota except for CEO, approval may be renewedfor another term of two years after assessing the performance of respective expatriate officer. ForCEOs, approval may be extended for two terms (4 more years) on the basis of performance records.The renewal for the term of expatriates permitted in excess of the normal quota (case-by-case basis)will be considered only for extension of the projects/assignments or new projects/assignments.

LIGHT A MILLION CANDLES CAMPAIGN

The urgent attention of all commercial banks is drawn to interpretation clause 33 of the Financial TransactionsReporting Act No.6 of 2006 which lists “offences against children” as an unlawful activity in terms of the law.

In this regard it has been brought to our attention that child pornography websites are being contributed to bycustomers through electronic payments systems and internet transactions. It is felt that credit cards remain the mostcommon method of on-line payment used by consumers and utilized by purveyors of pornographic material.

A task force of the Sri Lanka Commercial Banks established for this purpose, in collaboration with the FIU, isworking on a modus operandi to eradicate the commercial viability of child pornography.

The Financial Intelligence Unit, in its commitment to this noble cause and in giving effect to the provisions of theFTRA, invites the immediate attention of all commercial banks to the following imperatives:-

•To initiate, with immediate effect, additional KYC and CDD on existing and new credit card merchant bases witha special focus on the nature of business;•Report immediately to the FIU, in the form of a Suspicious Transaction Report, in terms of Section 7(1)(a) of theFTRA, any customer, transaction or merchant involved in offences against children, as illustrated above.

1.Responsibilities and Empowerment under the Banking Act and the Monetary Law Act

1(1)In terms of Section 46(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 last amended by No. 46 of 2006, in order to ensure thesoundness of the banking system, the Monetary Board has been empowered to issue Directions to licensedcommercial banks, regarding the manner in which any aspect of the business of such banks is to be conducted.

1(4)Under the provisions of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the supervision of banks has been made a duty ofthe Central Bank on account of specific reasons as stated in John Exter’s Report on the Monetary Law Act whichstates, inter alia, as follows: “Banking is an economic activity which affects the public welfare to an unusualdegree; it touches in one way or another, almost every phase of a country’s economic life. Sound banking isessential to healthy and vigorous economic development. Supervision of banks helps to protect the public againstmismanagement, bank failures, and loss of confidence in the banking system. It helps to protect depositors andstock-holders against loss and frequently enables bank directors and officers to manage the affairs of their banksmore wisely and intelligently.”

1(5)Accordingly, in order to enhance the overall banking sector stability which is the fundamental to financial systemstability, the Monetary Board, hereby issues Directions under Section 46(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 toimprove and sustain the corporate governance processes and practices of the licensed commercial banks in SriLanka.

2.The Principles upon which the rules of Corporate Governance have been based upon and developed are thefollowing:

The principles set out in this Direction 2 should be referred to for explanatory purposes and/or for clarificationpurposes only, so as to understand the rationale for the rules as contained in Direction 3 hereof. Hence, strictcompliance under these Directions shall only be in respect of the rules that are set out under Direction 3.

2(1)Principle: The Responsibilities of the Board

2(1)(i)The board of directors should assume the overall responsibility and accountability in respect of: (a) themanagement of the affairs of the bank, i.e., conduct of business and maintenance of prudent risk managementmechanisms; and (b) the safety and soundness of the bank.

2(1)(ii)Towards this end, the board should: (a) determine the structure of the management of affairs of the bank; (b)delegate business operations to key management personnel led by the chief executive officer designated by theboard; (c) assume policy making and risk management for the business; and (d) ensure the effective role of thekey management personnel. Key management personnel shall mean such key executives of the bank as definedin the International Accounting Standards.

2(1)(iii)The overall responsibility of the board should not be construed as an obligation to undertake the inspection ofday-to-day activities, but should rather be understood as an obligation to oversee and ensure that the keymanagement personnel are carrying out the day-to-day activities of the bank in a safe and sound manner inaccordance with the policies set by the board.

2(1)(iv)Directors should understand the business and risk management mechanism of the bank and take objectivedecisions in the interest of the bank’s depositors, creditors, shareholders and other stakeholders. Further, theyshould ensure that the bank does not act in a manner that is detrimental or prejudicial to the interests of, andobligations to, depositors and creditors.

2(1)(v)The board should take the responsibility for compliance with accepted rules of corporate governance. Theyshould also ensure compliance with all regulatory and supervisory requirements. Further, they should ensurethat an effective combination of professionals with practical experience in relevant subjects such as banking,finance, economics, business management, human resource management, law, marketing, information technologyor any other discipline relevant or complementary to banking operations, is available in the bank to undertakeits operations and discharge its responsibilities.

2(1)(vi)The directors should be aware of potential civil and criminal liabilities that may arise from their failure todischarge their duties diligently. They should also understand that they should act with due care and prudence.In addition, the directors of state owned banks should be aware of the additional liabilities that arise from thestatus of such banks being state enterprises and consequently being accountable to the public. It is, therefore,necessary that directors commit sufficient time and energy to fulfilling the board’s responsibilities in managingthe affairs of the bank in a prudent manner.

2(2)Principle: The Board’s composition

2(2)(i)The board should be composed of a healthy mix of executive directors and non-executive directors. Some ofthe non-executive directors should also be independent so that there is strong independent element brought intothe decision-making process.

2(2)(ii)The board’s composition should ensure a balance of skills and experience as may be deemed appropriate anddesirable for the requirements of the bank.

2(2)(iii)The banking industry worldwide is making tremendous progress and undergoing rapid change with newinnovations, instruments, technologies, products, systems and processes being introduced regularly. It is vitaltherefore, that the directors should be persons who would: (a) be able to keep abreast with these changes, and(b) provide continuous contribution and guidance to the board decision-making process.

2(2)(iv)There should be a gradual infusion of new ideas into the board. There should also be assurance that therelationships between the directors amongst themselves as well as between the directors and the key managementpersonnel is at a level that does not suggest the existence of excessive familiarity, undue influence or coercion.In this context, it should be noted that very long-standing relationships could sometimes impair the high senseof values, independence and objectivity that is needed in the discharge of the duties of a director of a bank.

2(3)Principle: Criteria to assess the Fitness and Propriety of Directors

2(3)(i)In addition to the principles under the board’s composition in’Direction 2(2) above, directors should be fit andproper persons in order to be eligible to hold office as directors of a bank and no person should serve as adirector unless such person is a fit and proper person.

2(3)(ii)There is strong need for commitment and effective contribution to the prudent management of the affairs of thebank. It is very likely that the effectiveness of such commitment and contribution would tend to decrease withadvanced age of directors and more particularly, if the age of such drector is well beyond the normal age ofretirement, as generally accepted in the country.

2(4)Principle: Management functions delegated by the Board

2(4)(i)The board should have a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. The board shouldalso give clear directions to key management personnel, as to the matters that should be approved by the boardbefore decisions are made by key management personnel, on behalf of the bank.

2(5)Principle: The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer

2(5)(i)There are two key aspects of the management of every bank, viz., (a) the overall governance by the board, and(b) the day-to-day management of the bank’s business by the CEO, in line with board approved strategicobjectives, corporate values, overall risk policy and risk management procedures.

2(5)(ii)There should be a clear division of these responsibilities at the board level and the executive management levelto ensure a greater balance of power and authority, so that powers are not concentrated in any one individual.

2(5)(iii)The board should appoint a chairman as well as a chief executive officer. The division of responsibilities betweenthe chairman and chief executive officer should be clearly established and set out in writing.

2(6)Principle: Board appointed Committees

2(6)(i)The board should appoint separate board committees for audit, selection, remuneration, integrated riskmanagement and such other subjects as determined by the Board to ensure its oversight and control over theaffairs of the bank.

2(6)(ii)Where the board appoints a committee, it should set out the authority of the committee, and in particular,whether the committee has the authority to act on behalf of the board or simply has the authority to examine aparticular issue and report back to the board with recommendations.

2(6)(iii)Each committee should be chaired by a non-executive director who has some expertise in the relevant subject,and who preferably should be independent too. The majority of the members of the board committee shouldconsist of non-executive directors with at least one independent director in the committee. If a need arises,professionals from outside may be invited or hired to serve in a committee. Bank staff may be present at theboard committees for advice or special assignments, on invitation.

2(7)Principle: Related party transactions

2(7)(i)The board should ensure that the bank does not engage in transactions with “related parties” in a manner thatwould grant such parties “more favourable treatment” than that accorded to other constituents of the bankcarrying on the same business.

2(8)Principle: Disclosures

2(8)(i)The objective of disclosure is the transparency of information relating to affairs and risk management of bankswhich would help to promote market discipline of the respective banks.

2(8)(ii)Since market disclosure is the focus of the Pillar III of the risk management based capital standard known asBasel II recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at the Bank for International Settlements,(which is the globally accepted body on introducing international standards on Bank Supervision), the extent ofdisclosures should be commensurate with the size, ownership structure, systemic importance, risk profile andthe business model of the bank. Accordingly, it should be noted that the adequate and timely public disclosureof relevant information by banks would facilitate enhanced market discipline and lead to better and more effectivecorporate governance.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FORLICENSED SPECIALISED BANKS IN SRI LANKA

In the exercise of the powers conferred by Section 76J(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, last amended by the BankingAct No. 46 of 2006, the Monetary Board hereby issues the following Directions on Corporate Governance for LicensedSpecialised Banks in Sri Lanka. These Directions may be cited as the Banking Act Direction No. 12 of 2007. The Sectionsreferred to in these Directions will be those of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, last amended by the Banking Act No. 46of 2006.

1.Responsibilities and Empowerment under the Banking Act and the Monetary Law Act

1(1)In terms of Section 76J(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 last amended by No. 46 of 2006, the MonetaryBoard has been empowered to issue Directions to licensed specialised banks or to any category of licensedspecialised banks, regarding the manner in which any aspect of the business of such banks is to be conducted.

1(2)In terms of Section 5 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is charged withthe duty of securing, as far as possible by action authorised by such Act, the two objectives, namely, (a) economicand price stability and (b) financial system stability.

1(3)In terms of Section 10(c) of the Monetary Law Act, the Monetary Board, in the exercise of its powers, duties,functions and responsibilities, is empowered to make such rules and regulations as the Monetary Board mayconsider necessary, in relation to any matter affecting or connected with or incidental to the exercise, discharge,or performance of the powers, functions, and duties of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

1(4)Under the provisions of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the supervision of banks has been made a dutyof the Central Bank on account of specific reasons as stated in John Exter’s Report on the Monetary Law Actwhich states, inter alia, as follows: “Banking is an economic activity which affects the public welfare to anunusual degree; it touches in one way or another, almost every phase of a country’s economic life. Soundbanking is essential to healthy and vigorous economic development. Supervision of banks helps to protect thepublic against mismanagement, bank failures, and loss of confidence in the banking system. It helps to protectdepositors and stock-holders against loss and frequently enables bank directors and officers to manage theaffairs of their banks more wisely and intelligently.”

1(5)Accordingly, in order to enhance the overall banking sector stability which is the fundamental to financialsystem stability, the Monetary Board, hereby issues Directions under Section 76J(1) of the Banking Act No. 30of 1988 to improve and sustain the corporate governance processes and practices of the licensed specialisedbanks in Sri Lanka.

1(6)For purposes of this Direction, Corporate Governance processes and practices shall be deemed to be themanagement framework that facilitates the conduct of the banking business in a responsible and accountablemanner so as to promote the safety and soundness of the individual banks, thereby leading to the stability of theoverall banking sector.

1(7)The rules of corporate governance as contained in Direction 3 of these Directions have, therefore, been developedon the basis of certain fundamental principles as set out in Direction 2 of these Directions with a view tofacilitating the underlying supervisory responsibilities of the Central Bank and to promote safety and soundnessof the banking system.

2.The Principles upon which the rules of Corporate Governance have been based upon and developed arethe following:

(xliii)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2007

2

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2007

Part III

The principles set out in this Direction 2 should be referred to for explanatory purposes and/or forclarification purposes only, so as to understand the rationale for the rules as contained in Direction 3hereof. Hence, strict compliance under these Directions shall only be in respect of the rules that are setout under Direction 3.

2(1)Principle: The Responsibilities of the Board

2(1)(i)The board of directors should assume the overall responsibility and accountability in respect of: (a) themanagement of the affairs of the bank, i.e., conduct of business and maintenance of prudent risk managementmechanisms; and (b) the safety and soundness of the bank.

2(1)(ii)Towards this end, the board should: (a) determine the structure of the management of affairs of the bank; (b)delegate business operations to key management personnel led by the chief executive officer designated by theboard; (c) assume policy making and risk management for the business; and (d) ensure the effective role of thekey management personnel. Key management personnel shall mean such key executives of the bank as definedin the International Accounting Standards.

2(1)(iii)The overall responsibility of the board should not be construed as an obligation to undertake the inspection ofday-to-day activities, but should rather be understood as an obligation to oversee and ensure that the keymanagement personnel are carrying out the day-to-day activities of the bank in a safe and sound manner inaccordance with the policies set by the board.

2(1)(iv)Directors should understand the business and risk management mechanism of the bank and take objectivedecisions in the interest of the bank’s depositors, creditors, shareholders and other stakeholders. Further, theyshould ensure that the bank does not act in a manner that is detrimental or prejudicial to the interests of, andobligations to, depositors and creditors.

2(1)(v)The board should take the responsibility for compliance with accepted rules of corporate governance. Theyshould also ensure compliance with all regulatory and supervisory requirements. Further, they should ensurethat an effective combination of professionals with practical experience in relevant subjects such as banking,finance, economics, business management, human resource management, law, marketing, information technologyor any other discipline relevant or complementary to banking operations, is available in the bank to undertakeits operations and discharge its responsibilities.

2(1)(vi)The directors should be aware of potential civil and criminal liabilities that may arise from their failure todischarge their duties diligently. They should also understand that they should act with due care and prudence.In addition, the directors of state owned banks should be aware of the additional liabilities that arise from thestatus of such banks being state enterprises and consequently being accountable to the public. It is, therefore,necessary that directors commit sufficient time and energy to fulfilling the board’s responsibilities in managingthe affairs of the bank in a prudent manner.

2(2)Principle: The Board’s composition

2(2)(i)The board should be composed of a healthy mix of executive directors and non-executive directors. Some ofthe non-executive directors should also be independent so that there is strong independent element brought intothe decision-making process.

2(2)(ii)The board’s composition should ensure a balance of skills and experience as may be deemed appropriate anddesirable for the requirements of the bank.

2(2)(iii)The banking industry worldwide is making tremendous progress and undergoing rapid change with newinnovations, instruments, technologies, products, systems and processes being introduced regularly. It is vitaltherefore, that the directors should be persons who would: (a) be able to keep abreast with these changes, and(b) provide continuous contribution and guidance to the board decision-making process.

2(2)(iv)There should be a gradual infusion of new ideas into the board. There should also be assurance that therelationships between the directors amongst themselves as well as between the directors and the key managementpersonnel is at a level that does not suggest the existence of excessive familiarity, undue influence or coercion.In this context, it should be noted that very long-standing relationships could sometimes impair the high senseof values, independence and objectivity that is needed in the discharge of the duties of a director of a bank.

2(3)Principle: Criteria to assess the Fitness and Propriety of Directors

2(3)(i)In addition to the principles under the board’s composition in’Direction 2(2) above, directors should be fit andproper persons in order to be eligible to hold office as directors of a bank and no person should serve as adirector unless such person is a fit and proper person.

2(3)(ii)There is strong need for commitment and effective contribution to the prudent management of the affairs of thebank. It is very likely that the effectiveness of such commitment and contribution would tend to decrease withadvanced age of directors and more particularly, if the age of such drector is well beyond the normal age ofretirement, as generally accepted in the country.

2(4)Principle: Management functions delegated by the Board

2(4)(i)The board should have a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. The board shouldalso give clear directions to key management personnel, as to the matters that should be approved by the boardbefore decisions are made by key management personnel, on behalf of the bank.

2(5)Principle: The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer

2(5)(i)There are two key aspects of the management of every bank, viz., (a) the overall governance by the board, and(b) the day-to-day management of the bank’s business by the CEO, in line with board approved strategicobjectives, corporate values, overall risk policy and risk management procedures.

2(5)(ii)There should be a clear division of these responsibilities at the board level and the executive management levelto ensure a greater balance of power and authority, so that powers are not concentrated in any one individual.

2(5)(iii)The board should appoint a chairman as well as a chief executive officer. The division of responsibilities betweenthe chairman and chief executive officer should be clearly established and set out in writing.

2(6) Principle: Board appointed Committees

2(6)(i) The board should appoint separate board committees for audit, selection, remuneration, integrated risk managementand such other subjects as determined by the Board to ensure its oversight and control over the affairs of thebank.

2(6)(ii)Where the board appoints a committee, it should set out the authority of the committee, and in particular,whether the committee has the authority to act on behalf of the board or simply has the authority to examine aparticular issue and report back to the board with recommendations.

2(6)(iii) Each committee should be chaired by a non-executive director who has some expertise in the relevant subject,and who preferably should be independent too. The majority of the members of the board committee shouldconsist of non-executive directors with at least one independent director in the committee. If a need arises,professionals from outside may be invited or hired to serve in a committee. Bank staff may be present at theboard committees for advice or special assignments, on invitation.

2(7)Principle: Related party transactions

2(7)(i)The board should ensure that the bank does not engage in transactions with “related parties” in a manner thatwould grant such parties “more favourable treatment” than that accorded to other constituents of the bankcarrying on the same business.

2(8)Principle: Disclosures

2(8)(i)The objective of disclosure is the transparency of information relating to affairs and risk management of bankswhich would help to promote market discipline of the respective banks.

2(8)(ii) Since market disclosure is the focus of the Pillar III of the risk management based capital standard known asBasel II recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at the Bank for International Settlements,(which is the globally accepted body on introducing international standards on Bank Supervision), the extent ofdisclosures should be commensurate with the size, ownership structure, systemic importance, risk profile andthe business model of the bank. Accordingly, it should be noted that the adequate and timely public disclosureof relevant information by banks would facilitate enhanced market discipline and lead to better and more effectivecorporate governance.

GUIDELINES FOR EMPLOYMENT OF EXPATRIATE STAFF IN BANKS

1Current Policy

1.1At present, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) recommends to Immigration and Emigration Departmentresident visas for expatriate staff of foreign banks to enable the banks to employ them as follows.

(i)Maximum of three officers without any restriction.

(ii)Permission for any officers exceeding 3 is granted on a case-by-case-basis for a specific period notexceeding one year subject to condition that local staff should be trained to handle the work initiated/undertaken by such expatriate officers.

1.2The objective of developing this policy is to provide local staff with the training and opportunities to take onpositions held by the expatriate officers.

1.3In the case of local banks, there has not been such a policy since local banks generally do not employ foreignpersonnel. However, four local banks have employed foreign consultants to undertake specific assignments.

2Need for a Revision of the Policy

The following factors are considered favourably to relax the current policy to permit more expatriate officers andto encourage domestic banks to employ foreign experts.

(i)Expansion of business operations of some foreign banks.

(ii)Foreign banks now tend to expand business in Sri Lanka, especially infrastructure projects, through fundsborrowed from their respective head offices and branches.

(iii)The active presence of foreign banks with internationally experienced professionals will help improve SriLanka’s image and investment promotion internationally.

(iv)Tendency to introduce international banking products such as securitization, loan syndication, foreign loanraising, infrastructure funding and derivative products.

(v)Banks in Sri Lanka mainly depend on conventional deposit and loan products. Introduction of innovativebanking products indicate the development of the financial sector and the economy. International bankingknow-how is necessary to introduce new banking products, especially to attract foreign capital to Sri Lanka.

(vi)Banks will need to employ risk management specialists to implement advanced approaches of Basel II inthe medium term and there may be a need to look for such specialists from countries which implement BaselII.

(vii)The proposed adoption of IAS/IFRS also will require bankers who have practical experience in adoptingIAS/IFRS.

(viii)In general, banking industry needs experts who have global banking experience if Sri Lankan banks are tointroduce modern banking products, technology and risk management techniques.

3Policy Guidelines

3.1For Foreign Banks

(i)The maximum number of expatriate officers permitted will be as follows:

(a)3 for banks whose staff strength is less than 75.(b)5 for banks with staff strength of 75 to 400.(c)10 for banks with staff strength of more than 400.

(ii)In the case of Indian banks, agreement as per on-going negotiations of the Comprehensive EconomicPartnership Agreement (CEPA) will be adopted as the minimum criteria.

LIGHT A MILLION CANDLES CAMPAIGN

The urgent attention of all commercial banks is drawn to interpretation clause 33 of the Financial TransactionsReporting Act No.6 of 2006 which lists “offences against children” as an unlawful activity in terms of the law.

In this regard it has been brought to our attention that child pornography websites are being contributed to bycustomers through electronic payments systems and internet transactions. It is felt that credit cards remain the mostcommon method of on-line payment used by consumers and utilized by purveyors of pornographic material.

A task force of the Sri Lanka Commercial Banks established for this purpose, in collaboration with the FIU, isworking on a modus operandi to eradicate the commercial viability of child pornography.

The Financial Intelligence Unit, in its commitment to this noble cause and in giving effect to the provisions of theFTRA, invites the immediate attention of all commercial banks to the following imperatives:-

•To initiate, with immediate effect, additional KYC and CDD on existing and new credit card merchant bases witha special focus on the nature of business;•Report immediately to the FIU, in the form of a Suspicious Transaction Report, in terms of Section 7(1)(a) of theFTRA, any customer, transaction or merchant involved in offences against children, as illustrated above.

RULES ON CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND NON BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONSIntroduction

Public confidence in financial institutions, and hence their stability, is enhanced by sound banking practices thatreduce financial risks to their operations. Money laundering and terrorist financing can harm the soundness of acountry’s financial system, as well as the stability of individual financial institutions, in multiple ways. Customeridentification and due diligence procedures also known as “know your customer” (KYC) rules, are part of aneffective AML/CFT regime. These rules are not only consistent with, but also enhance, the safe and sound operationof banking and other types of financial institutions.

While preparing operational guidelines on customer identification and due diligence procedures, financial institutionsare advised to treat the information collected from the customer for the purpose of opening of accounts, as confidentialand not divulge any details thereof for cross-selling or for any other purposes, and that the information sought isrelevant to the perceived risk, is not intrusive and is in conformity with the rules issued hereunder.

Actg. Additional DirectorFinancial Intelligence Unit,Central Bank of Sri Lanka18th May 2007

PART I - GENERAL GUIDANCE

A.Natural Persons

1.For natural persons the following information should be obtained, where applicable:•legal name and any other names used (such as maiden name);•correct permanent address (the full address should be obtained; a Post Office box number is not sufficient);•telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address;•date and place of birth;•nationality;•occupation, public position held and/or name of employer;•an official personal identification number or other unique identifier contained in an unexpired official document(e.g. passport, identification card, residence permit, social security records, driving licence) that bears aphotograph of the customer;

•type of account and nature of the financial institution in relationship;

•signature.

2.The financial institution should verify this information by at least one of the following methods:

•confirming the date of birth from an official document (e.g. birth certificate, passport, identity card, socialsecurity records);•confirming the permanent address (e.g. utility bill, tax assessment, bank statement, a letter from a public authority);•contacting the customer by telephone, by letter or by e-mail to confirm the information supplied after an accounthas been opened (e.g. a disconnected phone, returned mail, or incorrect e-mail address should warrant furtherinvestigation);•confirming the validity of the official documentation provided through certification by an authorised person(e.g. embassy official, notary public).

3.The examples quoted above are not the only possibilities. In particular jurisdictions there may be other documentsof an equivalent nature which may be produced as satisfactory evidence of customers’ identity.

4.Financial institutions should apply equally effective customer identification procedures for non-face-to-facecustomers as for those available for interview.

5.From the information provided in paragraph 10, financial institutions should be able to make an initial assessmentof a customer’s risk profile. Particular attention needs to be focused on those customers identified thereby ashaving a higher risk profile and additional inquiries made or information obtained in respect of those customers toinclude the following:-

•evidence of an individual’s permanent address sought through a credit reference agency search, or throughindependent verification by home visits;•personal reference (i.e. by an existing customer of the same institution);•prior bank reference and contact with the financial institution regarding the customer;•source of wealth;•verification of employment, public position held (where appropriate).

(lxxvi)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2007

2

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2007

Part III

6.For one-off or occasional transactions where the amount of the transaction or series of linked transactions does notexceed an established minimum monetary value, it might be sufficient to require and record only name and addressin instances where:-

•reliable information on the customer is publicly available to the bank/financial institution;•the financial institution is dealing with another bank whose AML/CFT controls it is well familiar with by virtueof a previous course of dealings;

7.It is important that the customer acceptance policy is not so restrictive that it results in a denial of access by thegeneral public to banking services, especially for people who are financially or socially disadvantaged.

B.Institutions

8.The underlying principles of customer identification for natural persons have equal application to customeridentification for all institutions. Where in the following the identification and verification of natural persons isinvolved, the foregoing guidance in respect of such persons should have equal application.

9.The term institution includes any entity that is not a natural person. In considering the customer identificationguidance for the different types of institutions, particular attention should be given to the different levels of riskinvolved.

C.Corporate Entities

10.For corporate entities (i.e. corporations and partnerships), the following information should be obtained:

•name of institution;•principal place of institution’s business operations;•mailing address of institution;•contact telephone and fax numbers;•some form of official identification number, if available (e.g. tax identification number);•the original or certified copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and Memorandum and Articles of Association;certificate of partnership or certificate of registration, where appropriate;•the resolution of the Board of Directors to open an account and identification of those who have authority tooperate the account;•nature and purpose of business and its legitimacy.

11.The financial institution should verify this information by at least one of the following methods:

•for established corporate entities - reviewing a copy of the latest report and accounts (audited, if available);

•conducting an enquiry by a business information service, or an undertaking from a reputable and known firm oflawyers or accountants confirming the documents submitted;•undertaking a company search and/or other commercial enquiries to see that the institution has not been, or isnot in the process of being, dissolved, struck off, wound up or terminated;•utilizing an independent information verification process, such as by accessing public and private databases;•obtaining prior bank references;•visiting the corporate entity, where practical;•contacting the corporate entity by telephone, mail or e-mail.

12.The financial institution should also take reasonable steps to verify the identity and reputation of any agent thatopens an account on behalf of a corporate customer, if that agent is not an officer of the corporate customer.

C1.Corporations/Partnerships

13.For corporations/partnerships, the principal guidance is to look behind the institution to identify those who havecontrol over the business and the company’s/partnership’s assets, including those who have ultimate control. Forcorporations, particular attention should be paid to shareholders, signatories, or others who inject a significantproportion of the capital or financial support or otherwise exercise control. Where the owner is another corporateentity or trust, the objective is to undertake reasonable measures to look behind that company or entity and to verify

(lxxvii)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2007

2

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2007

Part III

the identity of the principals. What constitutes control for this purpose will depend on the nature of a company, andmay rest in those who are mandated to manage funds, accounts or investments without requiring further authorisation,and who would be in a position to override internal procedures and control mechanisms. For partnerships, eachpartner should be identified and it is also important to identify immediate family members that have ownershipcontrol.

14.Where a company is listed on a recognised stock exchange, or is a subsidiary of such a company, then the companyitself may be considered to be the principal to be identified. However, consideration should be given to whetherthere is effective control of a listed company by an individual, small group of individuals or another corporateentity or trust. If this is the case then those controllers should also be considered to be principals and identifiedaccordingly.

D.Retirement Benefit Programmes

15.Where an occupational pension programme, employee benefit trust or share option plan is an applicant for anaccount the trustee and any other person who has control over the relationship (e.g. administrator, programmemanager, and account signatories) should be considered as principals and the financial institution should take stepsto verify their identities.

E. Mutuals/Friendly Societies, Cooperatives and Provident Societies

16.Where these entities are an applicant for an account, the principals to be identified should be considered to be thosepersons exercising control or significant influence over the organisation’s assets. This will often include boardmembers plus executives and account signatories.

F. Charities, Clubs and Associations

17.In the case of accounts to be opened for charities, clubs, and societies, the financial institution should take reasonablesteps to identify and verify at least two signatories along with the institution itself. The principals who should beidentified should be considered to be those persons exercising control or significant influence over the organisation’sassets. This will often include members of a governing body or committee, the President, any board members, thetreasurer, and all signatories.

18.In all cases independent verification should be obtained that the persons involved are true representatives of theinstitution. Independent confirmation should also be obtained of the purpose of the institution.

G.Trusts nominee and fiduciary accounts

19.Financial institutions should establish whether the customer is taking the name of another customer, acting as a“front” or acting on behalf of another person as trustee, nominee or other intermediary. If so, a necessary preconditionis receipt of satisfactory evidence of the identity of any intermediaries and of the persons upon whose behalf theyare acting, as well as details of the nature of the trust or other arrangements in place. Specifically, the identificationof a trust should include the trustees, settlers/grantors and beneficiaries.

When opening an account for a trust, the financial institution should take reasonable steps to verify the trustee(s),the settlor(s) of the trust (including any persons settling assets into the trust) any protector(s), beneficiary(ies), andsignatory(ies). Beneficiaries should be identified when they are defined. In the case of a foundation, steps shouldbe taken to verify the founder, the managers/directors and the beneficiaries.

H. Beneficial Owners

20.The financial institution should be able to justify the reasonableness of the measures taken, having regard to thecircumstances of each case. The financial institution may also consider obtaining an undertaking or declarationfrom the customer on the identity of, and the information relating to, the beneficial owner.

I. Professional Intermediaries

21.When a professional intermediary such as a lawyer, notary, other independent legal professional or accountant,opens a client account on behalf of a single client that client must be identified. Professional intermediaries willoften open “pooled” accounts on behalf of a number of entities. Where funds held by the intermediary are not co-mingled but where there are “sub-accounts” which can be attributable to each beneficial owner, all beneficialowners of the account held by the intermediary should be identified. Where the funds are co-mingled, the financialinstitution should look through to the beneficial owners; however, there may be circumstances which should be set

(lxxviii)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2007

2

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2007

Part III

out in supervisory guidance where the financial institution may not need to look beyond the intermediary (e.g.when the intermediary is subject to the same due diligence standards in respect of its client base as the financialinstitution).

22.Where such circumstances apply and an account is opened for an open or closed ended investment company, unittrust or limited partnership which is also subject to the same due diligence standards in respect of its client base asthe financial institution, the following should be considered as principals and the financial institution should takesteps to identify:

•the fund itself;•its directors or any controlling board where it is a company;•its trustee where it is a unit trust;•its managing (general) partner where it is a limited partnership;•account signatories;•any other person who has control over the relationship e.g. fund administrator or manager.

23.Where other investment vehicles are involved, the same steps should be taken as in paragraph 22 where it isappropriate to do so. In addition all reasonable steps should be taken to verify the identity of the beneficial ownersof the funds and of those who have control of the funds.

24.Intermediaries should be treated as individual customers of the financial institution and the standing of theintermediary should be separately verified by obtaining the appropriate information drawn from the itemised listsincluded in paragraphs 10-11 above.

J.Other Types of Institutions

25.For the account categories referred to in the aforementioned paragraphs, the following information should beobtained in addition to that required to verify the identity of the principals:

•name of account;•mailing address;•contact telephone and fax numbers;•some form of official identification number, if available (e.g. tax identification number);•description of the purpose/activities of the account holder (e.g. in a formal constitution);•copy of documentation confirming the legal existence of the account holder (e.g. register of charities).

26.The financial institution should verify this information by at least one of the following:

•obtaining an independent undertaking from a reputable and known firm of lawyers or accountants confirmingthe documents submitted;•obtaining prior bank references;•accessing public and private databases or official sources.

K. Introduced Business

27.For expediency, it has become customary for financial institutions to rely on the procedures undertaken by otherfinancial institutions or introducers when business is being referred. In doing so financial institutions risk placingexcessive reliance on the due diligence procedures that they expect the introducers to have performed. Relying ondue diligence conducted by an introducer, however reputable, does not in any way remove the ultimate responsibilityof the recipient bank to know its customers and their business. In particular financial institutions should not rely onintroducers that are subject to weaker standards than those governing the financial institutions’ own KYC proceduresor that are unwilling to share copies of due diligence documentation.

28.Financial institutions that use introducers should carefully assess whether the introducers are’“fit and proper” andare exercising the necessary due diligence in accordance with the standards set out in this paper. The ultimateresponsibility for knowing customers always lies with the financial institution. Financial institutions should usethe following criteria to determine whether an introducer can be relied upon:

(lxxix)

RULES ONKNOW YOUR CUSTOMER (KYC) & CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE (CDD)

FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRYIntroduction

Public confidence in financial institutions, and hence their stability, is enhanced by sound practices that reduce financialrisks to their operations. Money laundering and terrorist financing can harm the soundness of a country’s financialsystem, as well as the stability of individual financial institutions, in multiple ways. Customer identification and duediligence procedures also known as “know your customer” rules, are part of an effective AML/CFT regime. These rulesare not only consistent with, but also enhance, the safe and sound operation of banking and other types of financialinstitutions.

While preparing operational guidelines on customer identification and due diligence procedures, institutions are advisedto treat the information collected from the customer for the purpose of opening of accounts, as confidential and notdivulge any details thereof for cross-selling or for any other purposes, and that the information sought is relevant to theperceived risk, is not intrusive and is in conformity with the rules issued hereunder.

The mandatory rules on KYC/CDD include the following sections:

Part I-General RulesPart II-Specific RulesPart III-Specific Customer IdentificationPart IV-Declaration FormatPart V-Suspicious Transaction Report Format/Instructions

These rules are issued under Section 2(3) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act No.6 of 2006 and any contraventionof, or non-compliance with the same will be liable to the penalties under the relevant provisions of the Act.

Actg. DirectorFinancial Intelligence Unit,Central Bank of Sri Lanka28th December 2007

PART I

GENERAL RULES FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY

A.ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAM

1.Introduction

An institution should develop and implement a written program reasonably designed to prevent it from being usedfor money laundering and terrorist financing. This program should be approved in writing by the directors of thecompany which carries out the business of broker/dealer/market intermediary or by the trustee/s of a unit trust. Itshould include:

•the establishment of policies, procedures, and internal controls;•an ongoing employee training program;•an independent audit function to test the program for compliance; and•appropriate compliance management arrangements. The type and extent of measures to be taken for each ofthese requirements should be tailored with respect to the risk or vulnerability to money laundering and terroristfinancing and the size, location, and activities of the business.

(lxxxviii)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2007

2

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2007

Part III

2.Policies and Procedures

Written policies and procedures should set forth clearly the details of the program, including the responsibilities ofthe individuals and departments involved. Policies, procedures, and internal controls should be reasonably designedto detect activities indicative of money laundering and to assure compliance with anti-money laundering legislation.An institution should monitor the operation of its program and assess its effectiveness. Customer identification andverification procedures, as well as procedures regarding the detection and reporting of suspicious activity, shouldbe included as a part of the anti-money laundering program.

3.Employee Training

The training program for employees of the institution should provide both a general awareness of overall anti-money laundering legislation and money laundering issues, as well as more job-specific guidance regarding particularemployees’ roles and functions in the anti-money laundering program. For employees whose duties bring them incontact with anti-money laundering legislation or possible money laundering activity, training should occur whenthe employee assumes those duties, with subsequent periodic updates and refreshers.

4.Independent Audit

The institution should conduct periodic independent testing of its program to assess compliance with and theeffectiveness of the program, and to assure that the program is functioning as designed. Such testing may beaccomplished either by a qualified outside party, or by employees of the institution so long as those same employeesare not involved in the operation or oversight of the programme. A written assessment or report should be a part ofthe review, and any recommendations should be promptly implemented or submitted to the directors of a fundcompany, general partner of a limited partnership, or trustee of a unit trust for consideration.

5.Compliance Management

The institution should charge an individual (or group of individuals) with the responsibility for overseeing the anti-money laundering program. The person (or group of persons) should be knowledgeable regarding anti-moneylaundering legislation and money laundering issues and risks, and empowered with full responsibility and authorityto develop and enforce appropriate policies and procedures throughout.

6.Financial Services Groups and Anti-Money Laundering Programs

An institution often is part of a large financial services group. These groups may choose to establish an anti-moneylaundering program that applies to all institutions that they sponsor, operate or advise. Further, large financialservices groups that have banks, broker/dealers or insurance companies as their core business may already have inplace an anti-money laundering program that applies to all companies within the group. A financial services groupmay utilize the group’s anti-money laundering program, so long as every institution is covered by an anti-moneylaundering program containing the four elements set forth above. Each institution– through its board of directors,general partner or trustee - should have clear written documentation indicating that it has adopted an anti-moneylaundering program.

B. CLIENT IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION PROCEDURES

An institution may apply client verification procedures on a risk-sensitive basis. An institution should establish thebases for such risk determinations and should be able to justify its assessments to its regulator.

1.Responsibility for client identification and verification

An institution has a responsibility for verifying the identity of the investor, and the beneficial owner of the investorwhen it is apparent that an account is beneficially owned by a party other than the investor, and performing moregeneral “know your customer” procedures following a risk-based approach. The general “know your customer”procedures, including obtaining information, such as financial background and business objectives, in order todevelop a business and risk profile and to ensure that transactions being conducted are consistent with that profile(including, where necessary, the client’s source of funds).

2.Verifying investor identity

Measures to identify and verify the identity of the investor, and the beneficial owner of the investor when it isapparent that an account is beneficially owned by a party other than the investor, to the extent reasonable andpracticable, may be determined on a risk sensitive basis depending on the type of investor, business relationship or

(lxxxix)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2007

2

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2007

Part III

transaction, and the types of accounts opened by the institution. This applies to units sold or redeemed by theinstitution or through any market intermediary. The verification should provide a reasonable basis for an institutionto believe that the true identity of the investor is adequately known. Where the risk that an institution will not knowthe true identity of an investor is higher (e.g., accounts for politically exposed persons or entities with complexstructures; accounts for nationals, residents, or entities from countries considered to be non-cooperative orinadequately regulated, etc.), an institution should apply more stringent client identification measures. Investoridentification and verification processes should be properly documented in each case, and such records should bekept for at least six years after the business relationship has ended.

3.An institution may rely on documents as well as on non-documentary methods, or a combination of both, in orderto identify investors and verify their identity. With respect to natural persons, reliable verification methods couldinclude the following:

•An unexpired government-issued identification evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photographor other similar safeguards, such as a driver’s license or passport;

•Independently verifying the investor’s identity through the comparison of information provided by sourcessuch as public database, or other sources;•Checking references with other financial institutions;•Obtaining account statements; and•Face-to-face meetings; interviews; statements; home visits; references from previous business relationships.With respect to non-natural persons, reliable verification methods could include the following:•Obtaining proof of incorporation or similar evidence of the legal status of the legal person or arrangement, aswell as information concerning the investor’s name, the names of trustees, legal form, address, directors, anddocuments evidencing the power of a person to bind the legal person or arrangement;•Forming an understanding of the ownership and control structure; and•Identifying the natural persons with a controlling interest and identifying the natural persons who comprise themanagement of the legal person or arrangement.

4.With respect to another institution, and/or a fund of funds, an institution need not verify the identity of theunderlying beneficial owners of an investing Collective Investing Schemes (CIS) or fund of funds that:

•Is regulated or registered;•Is based in a jurisdiction that the an institution is satisfied has appropriate anti-money laundering legislation;•Has in place an anti-money laundering program; and•Is supervised for, and has measures in place to comply with, CDD requirements.

5.Timing of identification and verification

An institution should identify the investor before or during the opening of an account or accepting an investment.An institution should verify identity as soon as possible, before or after the opening of an account or accepting aninvestment, for purposes of assuring that the risks are effectively managed. In this regard, it is essential not tointerrupt the normal conduct of business.

Where the investor’s identity has yet to be verified, an institution will need to adopt risk management procedureswith respect to the conditions under which an investor may utilise the account or investment prior to verification.These procedures should include a set of measures such as a limitation of the number, types and/or amount oftransactions that can be performed, and the monitoring of large transactions being carried out of expected normsfor that type of relationship. Where it is not possible after reasonable efforts to verify the identity of an investor, aninstitution should consider halting transactions or terminating its relationship and also should consider making aSuspicious Activity Report to the appropriate authorities in relation to the investor. It may be appropriate for aninstitution to consult with its regulator and appropriate law enforcement agencies prior to halting transactions in aparticular account or terminating its relationship with any investor.

6.Potential low risk situations

As noted above, the identity verification procedures of an institution may be risk-based depending on the type ofinvestor, business relationship, or transaction. Where there are low risks, it may be appropriate for an institution to

(xc)

Part III

apply simplified verification procedures. These procedures, of course, must still be sufficient for the institution toachieve the goal of verification – establishing a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its investor.

In the event a broker firm/CDS obtains a confirmation from a bank which maintains a bank account for a clienttrading through a broker firm, to the effect that, when opening and maintaining the bank account, the bank hasfollowed the KYC and CDD requirements, the broker firm/CDS may at its discretion considering the risk level ofthe client, waive off the above requirements to verify the source of funds received.

PART II

2.Having considered the public policy objective of facilitating the customer to receive cheque proceeds within T+1,the National Payment Council at its meeting held on August 9, 2007, expressed the view that the Central Bank ofSri Lanka (CBSL) shall mandate all licensed commercial banks (LCBs) to publish in the newspapers or display inthe bank branches a notice indicating the cut-off times for cheque deposits:

(i)to facilitate T+1; or

(ii)to facilitate crediting proceeds of cheques in ….days (indicate number of days), where (i) above is notpossible; and

5.Each PI shall formulate procedures and norms on: cheque collection; crediting cheque proceeds to customers’accounts; and the modalities for handling customer complaints. Such procedures and norms shall ensure that theobligations of the PIs to the customers and the rights of the customers are established and observed in practice.

6.The PIs shall ensure that:(i)wide publicity is given to the contents in Paragraph 5 and times of cheque collection and crediting of customers’accounts by:(a)displaying prominently on the notice board in the banking hall in their branches and cheque collectingboxes, so that it attracts the customers’ attention as well as that of the employees for adherence; and(b) printing a message on the monthly current account statement; and(c)posting it on their web-sites before December 31, 2007.(ii) any changes to procedures and norms or time of cheque collection and crediting of customers’ accounts areduly informed to the customers;(iii) procedures are clearly laid down to assess staff accountability for any delays.
