However, as announced at theBank Managers\u2019 Meeting held on November 22, 2007, the Central Bank has decided to adopt Pillar 1, i.e., \u201cMinimumCapital Requirements\u201d\u201deffective from 1st January 2008 and to adopt the other two pillars in the medium term. Theapproach for adoption of Basel II is as follows.2.1 The Adoption of Pillar I: Minimum Capital RequirementsThe Basel II framework provides several options for the implementation of the Pillar I, based on the level ofsophistication and development of the banking system. Accordingly, all LCBs and all LSBs are required to applythe Standardised Approach for credit risk, the Standardised Measurement Method for market risk and the BasicIndicator Approach for operational risk, in computing the capital requirements, commencing January 1, 2008.For this purpose, the following documents are attached herewith.(i) Banking Act Directions No. 9 (for LCBs) and 10 (for LSBs) dated 26.12.2007 issued by the Monetary Board.(ii) Guidelines on computation of capital adequacy ratio (Schedule I).*",

Accordingly, banks are required to implement changes, especially plan for systems integration, modificationsto internal systems and use of new software for appropriate data collection, to move to the advanced approaches.In this regard, Banks are expected to have in place, or be actively developing, a data \u201cwarehouse\u201d, that is, aprocess that enables a bank to collect, store and draw upon loss statistics in an efficient manner over time.
