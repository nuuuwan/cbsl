    "text": "n 2007, the Sri Lankan economy recordeda growth of well above 6 per cent for thethird consecutive year for the first timesince Independence, demonstrating that SriLanka has now moved on to a higher growth pathof above 6 per cent per annum from the historicalaverage of around 4-5 per cent. The economygrew by 6.8 per cent, the annual average rate ofunemployment reached its lowest ever recordedlevel of 6.0 per cent, while the per capita incomerose further to US dollars 1,617 in 2007. Thisperformance is commendable, as it was achievedin a challenging environment of heightened securityconcerns arising from intensified terrorist activitiesand rising petroleum and commodity prices ininternational markets which threatened theachievement of price stability. The tight monetarypolicy stance of the Central Bank decelerated thegrowth in monetary aggregates and slowed downthe aggregate demand to a certain extent during2007, reflecting the effectiveness of demandmanagement policies. However, it was disappointingfor the monetary authority to observe the negationof the demand management efforts by external priceshocks and supply side shocks, despite the tighterand more disciplined monetary policy stancemaintained by the Central Bank. These external pricemovements and supply side shocks resulted in ahigher than expected inflation towards the secondhalf of the year. The fiscal consolidation processpursued by the government moved in the rightdirection; both the fiscal deficit and public debtcontinued to improve in line with the trend observedin recent years despite the lower than expectedrevenue collection during the year. This wasachieved amidst significant challenges faced by thegovernment such as rising defence expenditure,rising domestic interest rates and the need to grantseveral tax and duty concessions in order to rein in",

In the services sector, posts andtelecommunications, cargo handling, transport, andfinancial services were the key performing sectors.Construction, export manufacturing, and mining andquarrying activities performed well in the industrialsector. Most of the agricultural activities achievedrelatively high growth rates, but the drop in theproduction of two major crops, viz., tea and paddy,dampened the overall growth performance of thesector. The expansion of the economy generated moreemployment opportunities, contributing to a furtherdrop in the annual unemployment rate from 6.5 percent in 2006 to 6.0 per cent in 2007, the lowest annualunemployment rate ever reported.",

Amidstthese adverse trends, the fiscal sector continued itsimproving trend, albeit at a slower pace than originallyenvisaged. Notwithstanding the improvements, thesector still suffers from several drawbacks such asshortfalls in revenue collection, overruns in recurrentexpenditure, lower than expected performance in thepublic investment programme and weak financialperformance of major state trading enterprises (STEs)and state owned enterprises (SOEs).

Ithas been encouraging to observe the continuousimprovements in labour productivity over the years,especially in the industry and services sectors thathave contributed to higher economic growth in recentyears. However, an increasing mismatch in laboursupply and demand is reflected by the high rate ofyouth unemployment, including graduates, and theirdesire to join the already large public service, whilecertain sectors in the private sector are finding it difficultto recruit necessary skilled labour. Meanwhile,improving productivity in the agriculture sector is aprerequisite to achieve the envisaged target growth inthe agriculture sector and a more balanced regionaldevelopment in view of the declining labour forceavailable for agriculture employment.Although Sri Lanka\u2019s educational achievementsin terms of literacy rates, primary and secondaryeducation are commendable and on par withdeveloped countries, tertiary education,particularly the university education, is laggingbehind regional peers. The admission to universityeducation in Sri Lanka is extremely competitive, andnot more than 15 per cent of those qualified foruniversity education gain admission to local publicuniversities. Even those 15 per cent of best studentshave to face a supply driven university educationsystem which has little relevance to labour marketrequirements and entrepreneurial culture, creating amismatch between labour supply and demand. About65 per cent of the students admitted to localuniversities study social sciences and humanities anda substantial proportion of such graduates encounterdifficulties in finding productive employment. Theyremain unemployed or underemployed for a longperiod, leading to frustration and social problems.Financial or resource constraints also limit theimprovement of the public university system,highlighting the need for securing alternative sourcesof financing. Therefore, the higher education systemrequires urgent reforms to provide a more relevanthigher education for all and to address the mismatchin labour supply and demand (Box 8).",

During thesecond half of 2007, higher international oil andcommodity prices and turbulence in financialmarkets resulting from the subprime meltdown thatoriginated in the US, dented the growthmomentum. The global economy, which grew at ahealthy rate during the first three quarters of 2007slowed markedly in the last quarter, largely due toturbulence in the financial markets. According to theWorld Economic Outlook (WEO, Update - January2008) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), theworld economy is estimated to have grown by 4.9 percent in 2007 as compared to a growth of 5.0 per centin 2006. Economic growth in the US slowedsignificantly in the fourth quarter with the weakeningof manufacturing and housing sector activity. However,rapid growth in China, India, Russia and Brazil hasoffset the moderate growth in US and these countriestogether accounted for about one-half of global growthover the past year. The other emerging market anddeveloping countries have also maintained robustgrowth. Growth has slowed in the Euro area, partlydue to the strengthening of the euro and the slowingdown of the US economy. In Japan, growth has beendampened due to slowing construction industry arisingfrom tightening in building standards, slower globalgrowth and relatively stronger yen.",

In order to ensure uninterrupted power supplyat a reasonable cost and to ensure commercial viabilityof the CEB, it is essential for the CEB to procurecheaper power from the private sector powerproducers, under properly structured PPParrangements on the basis of competitive biddingmechanisms. Further, to address the structural issuesat the CEB to ensure its commercial viability, newstrategies need to be introduced and implemented. Anydelay in implementing the necessary improvementswould weaken the financial viability of the CEB further,and adversely impact on the future growth of thecountry by retarding growth in all industries throughhigher tariff and, inadequate and unreliable powersupply.",
