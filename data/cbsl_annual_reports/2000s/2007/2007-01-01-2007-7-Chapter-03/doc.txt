3.1 Overview

conomic and social infrastructuredevelopment is essential for creating newavenues for investment, improvingaccessibility across regions and opening newmarkets. It would generate new employmentopportunities and finally, support sustainableeconomic growth. The strategy adopted by Sri Lankafor economic and social infrastructure developmentthroughout its post-independence history has beenfor the public sector to provide basic essentialservices, through direct budgetary allocation orforeign donor support. This appears to be the policythrust in the current period as well. Accordingly, thegovernment has launched a multi-focusedprogramme of infrastructure development ashighlighted in the Ten-Year Horizon DevelopmentFramework 2006-2016 and in government’s Randoraprogramme. These programmes have beendesigned in order to develop a regionally balancednetwork of economic infrastructure with investmentschannelled through the Consolidated Fund, privateand foreign direct investments and Public PrivatePartnerships (PPP). While the currently proposedinvestment programme in infrastructure is laudable,the basic issues relating to economic and socialinfrastructure development need to be addressedurgently so as to generate quality as well assustainable economic growth with a proper balancein the macroeconomy. The issue has been the non-adjustment of prices in the transport, petroleum andpower sectors to reflect their rising costs and therebyeliminating the unproductive direct and indirectsubsidies, which has caused a major macroeconomicimbalance in recent years. In this sense, the recentadjustment of petroleum prices could be viewed as amove taken in the right direction. But, it is alsonecessary to eliminate all other unproductive anduntargeted subsidy elements and free budgetaryresources for other productive investments.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

The Randora programme provides the basis forinfrastructure development within the Ten-YearHorizon Development Framework 2006-2016.Roads, energy, water supply and sanitation, ports andaviation, transport and rural infrastructure developmentare the main areas focused under the economicinfrastructure development of the Randora programme.The implementation of the infrastructure programmeis to take place at both the national and regional levels.The national level projects comprise the developmentof the Southern Expressway, Colombo-KandyExpressway and Colombo Outer Circular Road, thedevelopment of Norochcholai coal power plant andUpper Kotmale hydropower plant, large scale watersupply and sanitation projects especially in Jaffna andAmpara districts and major aviation and portdevelopment projects such as Colombo port expansionand Hambantota port development projects. “MagaNeguma” (Development of roads) and “GamaNeguma” (Development of villages) programmes areimplemented at the regional level to facilitate ruralinfrastructure development in the country to enable thecountry to achieve economic development that isregionally balanced.

Greater attention needs to be paid to thedevelopment of the social infrastructure, includingeducation and health services. Despite the fact thatSri Lanka has achieved a relatively higher rank inhuman development, there is an untapped potential inthese two sectors to contribute to a faster economicgrowth in the country. These also underline the needfor new thinking and strategies, especially in relatingto the production, delivery, pricing and value-recordingof the services concerned. Such improvements, once

initiated, should be vigorously and rigorously followed,as an urgent national policy. Both sectors havesignificant opportunities for further investment andbring them in line with the global platform where SriLanka could be a “value-adding producer” of theseservices in the global market.

The development of economic infrastructurethrough PPP has been identified as a keydevelopment strategy, so as to relieve the budgetof the burden of financing. Several infrastructuredevelopment projects such as those pertaining to ports,power, airports and road development have beenidentified for implementation under the PPP strategy.The growing budget constraints of the governmenthighlight the importance of the active role that theprivate sector should play in implementing andmanaging infrastructure projects. While non-commercial risks, such as political and environment,are borne by the government, the skills of the privatesector in managing commercial risks are harnessedunder PPP.

Infrastructure services showed mixedperformance in 2007. A rapid growth was seen inthe telecommunications industry due to increasedcompetition with the introduction of Code DivisionMultiple Access (CDMA) technology and the entry ofa new private operator to the industry. Port servicesgrew at a significant rate, benefiting from productivityimprovements and the healthy growth in internationaltrade. However, the energy sector continued to sufferfrom high oil prices in international markets. Theelectricity sector, which depends heavily on thermalpower generation, suffered from oil price hikes, causingsevere cash flow imbalances to the monopolyproducer, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The delayin the implementation of a cost reflective tariff systemand low cost power generation projects, and theunfavourable power purchase agreements with theIndependent Power Producers (IPP) were the maincauses for the weak financial position of CEB. In thepetroleum sector, though oil prices reached historicallyhigh levels in 2007, the adjustment of domesticpetroleum prices helped reduce imbalances in thefinancial position of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation(CPC). Meanwhile, preliminary work relating to oilexploration in the Mannar basin was initiated with thecalling for international bids from prospective investorscum oil exploring entities in late 2007. Passengertransportation registered a moderate growth in 2007.The civil aviation sector registered only a marginalgrowth due to negative growth registered in the tourismsector. The construction of houses expanded rapidly,benefiting from the growing housing market and

Withrespect to ensuring quality, the establishment of thePrivate Health Service Regulatory Council is anencouraging development. Efforts were made to furtherstreamline the Samurdhi programme with a view torationalizing the entry and exit systems.

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies,Institutional Framework andPerformance

Communications Services

The growth momentum in the telecommunicationssector continued in 2007, largely supported by afurther expansion in the coverage, introduction ofadvanced technology and value added services,increased competition and affordability, and higherinvestments. The subscriber network of thetelecommunications sector grew by 47 per cent in2007, following the 58 per cent growth in 2006. Fixedaccess telephone connections expanded by 46 percent during the year, largely due to an expansion ofthe wireless network with CDMA technology. Themobile telephones network increased by 48 per centin 2007, compared to the previous year. Mobiletelephone penetration (mobile connections as a percent of total population) increased significantly to 40per cent in 2007 from 27 per cent in 2006. With thesedevelopments, the telephone density (telephones per100 persons), including cellular phones, increased to54 in 2007 from 37 at end 2006. Subscribers of Internetand email services also increased substantially by 56per cent to 202,348 in 2007. This rapid growth incommunications foretells future economicdevelopment by reducing the transaction costs onbasic information and data transfers.

The rapid growth in the telecommunicationssector was facilitated by healthy competition. Thetelecommunications sector presently consists of 4 fixedline operators, 5 mobile operators, 33 external gatewayoperators and 29 Internet service providers. TheTelecommunications Regulatory Commission of SriLanka (TRC) licensed a mobile operator to providefixed lines in 2007. TRC has also licensed a fifth mobileoperator in 2007. With the increased competition,operators have reduced their charges, while addingnew services and improving quality and coverage. SriLanka Telecom (SLT) has revised its tariff andintroduced a new time based tariff structure fromNovember 2007. The subscriber levy on the usage ofmobile phones was increased up to 10 per cent in 2007and extended to cover wireless phones also with effect

from 2008.

Several new telecommunications projects wereimplemented in 2007 to improve the capacity,technology, coverage and efficiency of the service.SLT allocated Rs. 9.25 billion as capital investment in2007 for infrastructure development and other relatedenhancements. Out of the total allocation, 67 per centwas utilized during the year. SLT established a whollyowned subsidiary company in Hong Kong under thename “SLT Hong Kong Limited” with the aim of makingit an important point of presence in SLT’s endeavourto connect Asia with the rest of the world through SriLanka.

Virtual Private Network (IPVPN) and international voicetraffic transit services are some of the key servicesprovided to global telecom operators and corporationsin Hong Kong through this venture. A submarine cablewith Dhiraagu of Maldives was commissioned forservice in 2007. With the increasing demand for high-speed data services outside Colombo, the MetroEthernet network was expanded to regions coveringmajor cities in the country. Private sector operators oftelecommunications facilities also invested significantlyfor expansion of their services.

Postal services further expanded, despite thechallenges posed by the rapid developments ininformation and communication technology, witha better alternative of e-mail based communication.The post office network, including private agency postoffices expanded further in 2007. The total number ofpost offices increased to 4,737 by end 2007. Theaverage population served by a post office was 4,252in 2007. Several new services, such as providingcertain banking facilities, insurance services and sellingpre-paid phone cards through post offices wereintroduced in 2007. However, the future of the postalservices will largely depend on the use of moderntechnology to reduce costs, enhance delivery anddiversify its services.

The Department of Posts (DOP) continued toreport operating losses despite revision of postalcharges. Postal charges were revised upward witheffect from 27 April, 2007 to cover a part of theincreased expenditure. DOP has also implemented aprogramme for cost management under which itexpects to reduce its operating cost by 10 per cent,with a view of further strengthening its financialsituation. However, the operating loss of DOPamounted to Rs. 3,797 million in 2007, exerting a heavyburden on the government budget. The extensivepostal network could be used more efficiently to providevarious services in a commercially viable manner,making the postal department an income generatingsource for the government, without being a burden onthe budget. DOP certainly provides a valuable serviceto the nation, but unless it becomes a self-financingventure, it cannot become a “value adding” service.

Energy

Continuing high oil prices in the internationalmarkets have been a major challenge faced by theeconomy in the past few years. The high dependenceon petroleum products for electricity generation,transportation and industrial production, in thepresence of escalating oil prices, has made the SriLankan economy vulnerable to oil price shocks. The

average import price of crude oil (c & f) increasedsharply by about 10.5 per cent to an average of USdollars 71.96 a barrel in 2007 and continued itsincreasing trend even in 2008. This highlights theimportance of adopting a multi-faceted strategy toaddress the issue: developing alternative energysources, including renewable energy, adopting energyconservation methods and taking measures for bothmacro and micro energy demand management.

Electricity

Electricity generation increased by 4.5 per centto 9,814 GWh during the year. Hydropowergeneration decreased significantly in 2007 due to thelow rainfall in catchment areas during the first fewmonths of the year. The share of hydropower in thetotal electricity generation decreased to 40 per cent in2007 from 49 per cent in 2006. The decrease in lowcost hydropower generation by 687 GWh in 2007adversely affected the financial position of CEB in thepresence of escalating oil prices. Out of the totalelectricity generation, 60 per cent is from fossil fuelbased power plants, which consume around 30 percent of petroleum sales of the country.

The sales of electricity, which exclude systemloss out of the total generation, increased by 5.7per cent to 8,276 GWh in 2007. Electricity demandgrowth has decelerated in recent years due largely tothe slow growth in domestic and industrial sectordemand which had to change its consumption patternin line with the upward revision of electricity tariff.Electricity consumption in the general-purposecategory and domestic sector grew by 16.6 per centand 5.7 per cent, respectively, while electricityconsumption in the industrial sector grew marginallyin 2007. The system losses as a percentage of totalgeneration declined further to 15.6 per cent in 2007.However, a system loss at this level is still relativelyhigh and unaffordable for a loss-making venture.Hence, continuous action is needed to reduce this toa level on par with international best experiences.The electricity sector suffered from escalatingoil prices as well as other institutional andstructural weaknesses. CEB continued to dependhighly on thermal power, mainly from the private sector,on unfavourable terms and conditions to meet the risingdemand for electricity. In 2007, about 60 per cent oftotal electricity generation was from thermal power. Inthe meantime, delays in implementing low cost energysources have led to high cost of power generation.The existing financial and institutional issues in thepower generation by CEB remained without beingaddressed. However, several capacity expansionprojects were in progress in 2007. The constructionwork of the 150 MW Upper Kotmale hydropower projectand the first phase of the 300 MW Norochcholai coalpower plant have continued in 2007. These twoprojects will be connected to the national grid by 2011.Another thermal power plant at Kerawalapitiya isexpected to be commissioned its operation during thesecond half of 2008. The government is also planningto construct 4 medium scale hydropower plants,namely, Uma Oya, Ginganga, Broadland andMoragolla. Another coal power plant of 500 MW, inTrincomalee is under consideration.Several changes were introduced to theelectricity tariff in 2007. The Value Added Tax (VAT)of 15 per cent on electricity consumption was removedfrom January 2007. Given the current operating lossesin CEB, these charges appear to bring adverse resultson the budget. In addition to the removal of VAT, theindustrial sector was benefited by the exemption ofthe payment of fuel adjustment charge of 20 per centwith effect from 2007. Though these measures wouldminimise the cost of living of domestic users, their long-term adverse effect on both CEB and the governmentbudget would be significant: CEB would suffer from a

lack of power conservation by public while the budgetwould be without its usual income sources. Theaverage tariff in 2007 was Rs.10.58 per unit, whereasthe average cost was Rs.13.48 per unit. The estimatedaverage purchased cost of private power was Rs. 14.92per unit in 2007. The need for a tariff adjustment hasarisen in the light of high cost of power generation asa result of escalating oil prices. With the already hightariffs prevailing in the country, it is vital that the CEBexpedites the implementation of low cost powerprojects and encourage the development of alternativerenewable energy sources, urgently.CEB’s financial position further deteriorated in2007. CEB’s operating losses have increased to Rs. 15billion, excluding indirect subsidies through lower fuelprices. If the CPC subsidies are internalized, the totaloperating loss would be Rs. 21 billion. CEB’s short-term borrowings from commercial banks, payments inarrears to the CPC and IPP and other short-termliabilities amounted to Rs. 55 billion at end 2007. CEB’slong-term loans amounted to Rs. 89 billion by end2007. The financial position of CEB is therefore fragileand alarming. Since it is a state sector monopoly, itsfuture solvency will largely fall on the taxpayers.However, the storng belief that CEB would beeventually bailed out by the taxpayers has also dialutedthe incentive for CEB to improve and to introduceefficiency measures. If this state of affairs is allowedto continue, willingly or unwillingly, the nation will haveto soon shoulder this burden as well.Urgent action is needed for the conservation ofenergy and the development of renewable energysources to deal with impact of present energycrisis. Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority(SLSEA) was established in 2007 with a view toensuring energy security, increasing indigenous energygeneration and curbing the growth of unnecessaryenergy intensity in the economy. SLSEA has embarkedon several initiatives to make the currently practised

Box 7Conflicts of Public-Private Partnerships inPower Generation

The total electricity generation in Sri Lanka during 2007amounted to 9,814 GWh, of which 3,873 GWh orapproximately 40 per cent was generated by private sectorpower producers. The private sector power producers inSri Lanka consist of Independent Power Producers (IPPs)and small-scale hydro power generating establishments. Amajor share of private sector electricity generation is fromIPPs by way of thermal generation which amountsapproximately to 90 per cent (3,528 GWh) of total privatesector electricity generation. The IPPs in Sri Lanka werefirst introduced in December 1996 when there was a severeshortage of power as hydro power generation ability waslimited due to a prolonged drought. At present, there are 10IPPs in operation with a combined generation capacity ofaround 550 MW. They play a major role in the power sectorby contributing about 1/3 of total electricity generation.

The most important step in any electricity utilityrestructuring, including the decision to obtain the serviceof IPPs, is to understand and articulate the goals ofrestructuring. Possible goals of introducing IPPs include;

•to attract outside capital to meet rapidly growingelectricity needs without imposing large strains on publicfunds;

•to reduce electricity costs through competitive biddingprocess and more efficient operations; and

•to share the risks and returns between the private sectorand the public sector.

However, in reviewing the performance of IPPs in SriLanka, it is observed that most of the goals listed abovehave not been fulfilled. Based on the perceived goals ofengaging IPPs in a country, the major categories of risks ofany private sector participant (IPPs) include,

•Currency risk- The risk that IPP operations or the valueof investment will be affected by changes in theexchange rate. IPPs may attract foreign equity or borrowinternationally for their investment. They may also havecost components in their operations like the maintenanceof plant and machinery which are likely to vary withchanges in the exchange rate. Hence, if their income isin domestic currency, they could be exposed to currencyrisks.

•Payment risk- Default by the purchaser of power, if thepurchaser is to become financially weak.

•Political risk- The possibility that existing or futuregovernments may change the rules of engagement.

•Management risk- IPPs may face an increased risk oflosing their management oversight, if their participationwere through minority equity ownership.

•Technology and Performance risk- The technologyselected may not perform as originally expected.

The pricing formula based on which the purchase priceof power is determined should reflect the extent of risk takenby IPPs and the purchaser, i.e., Ceylon Electricity Board(CEB). However, in Sri Lanka, IPPs' pricing formula andterms and conditions in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)are not compatible with the extent to which IPPs carryaforesaid risks, as explained below.

•The IPPs in Sri Lanka are not exposed to the currencyrisk as some IPP cost components relating to paymentsin foreign exchange such as equipment and repair costs,and cost of foreign capital are denominated in foreigncurrency. In fact, under existing operationalarrangements, CEB absorbs the currency risk involved.

•The non-payment for power purchases by the CEB ispractically not possible under existing IPP operationalarrangements and any delay in payment is penalized bya late payment charge. In addition, there is an implicitgovernment guarantee as the CEB is a state ownedenterprise. Moreover, the Treasury provides a guaranteefor the repayment of loans raised by the IPPs and allloans including interest payment are included in thecapacity charge which is paid by the CEB irrespectiveof whether CEB purchases power or not from the IPPs.Any default/ breakdown that may arise from majorforces of catastrophically high magnitude events suchas natural disasters, civil commotions and riots, acts ofterrorism are also covered by an insurance cover forwhich the premium is paid by the CEB. Therefore, thereis no default risk faced by the IPPs.

•As a policy and redress available under the judicialsystem, any alteration of existing IPP agreementswithout the consent of all parties involved is impossible.

•The management control of the IPPs in Sri Lanka restswith IPPs either in full or in a majority stake. Therefore,there is no risk of IPPs losing their managementoversight.

•The technology and performance risk fully rests withIPPs. This is because, IPPs have the unquestionable rightto choose the type of technology and modus operandiin order to minimize the risk.

Therefore, the existing PPAs transfer all possible risksto the public sector, while IPPs enjoy a guaranteed profitplus healthy margins through overestimated costcomponents. There are several deficiencies in the existingPPAs which generate excessive profits over and above theguaranteed return to the IPPs at a cost to the general public.Major deficiencies are summarized below.

•IPP operations in Sri Lanka are contracted to reflect therelationship between IPPs and CEB in the form of aproducer-customer which is a wrong concept.Preferably, the contracts should have been designed toreflect CEB’s role as a partner in the project. A majorshare of the project cost (70 per cent) is serviced by theCEB by way of guaranteed capacity charges backed bya government guarantee. Therefore, CEB should haveretained the ownership equivalent to at least up to 70per cent of the asset value. Accordingly, the maximumasset value to be owned by the IPPs should be limitedto 30 per cent or to their equity contribution to the totalcommercial value of the asset. However, the existingPPAs gives away 100 per cent ownership of the asset tothe IPPs.

•The power plants could be constructed on the basis of“turn-key” projects, where the IPPs will receive theplants ready to operate, or on the basis of “greenfield”projects, where the construction work is undertaken bya third party with relevant expertise in power plantconstruction. However, in Sri Lanka, the Civilconstruction work of the project is also undertaken bythe IPPs without any competitive or tender based biddingprocess, resulting in a substantially overestimation ofcosts generating huge profits to IPPs even before theproject commence commercial operations.

•All financing costs are paid by the CEB at rates whichare well above the normal market rates. Interestpayments have also been overestimated by addingSWAP margins on top of commercial interest rates.

•Insurance premiums are quoted through a non-competitive basis at very much above the market rates.In an event of a claim, the benefit goes to IPPs whereasthe premium is paid by the CEB.

•Working Capital mainly for buffer fuel, which is addedto the initial project cost and recovered by the IPPs after

the commencement of commercial operations, are neverreturned to the CEB.

•Fuel transport rates are well above the market rates.Sometimes they are three times the rate paid by theCeylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to the privatesector operators.

The IPPs enjoy above benefits despite their equitycontribution being only 30 per cent of the capital cost, whilethe general public eventually pay for the losses incurred bythe CEB due to deficiencies in PPAs. On a broader scale, ifthese overstated costs are reassessed at 2007 market pricesfor the total 550 MW thermal power plants operated by IPPs,a substantial amount could be saved in many different forms.It has been estimated that the annual cost of the aboveunfavourable conditions would be around Rs. 3 billion.

In addition, by giving away the 70 per cent ownershipof the asset value, CEB would not only lose its share ofannual profits, but also the asset value at the end of thecontract period. The loss of profit to the CEB for the total550 MW thermal power plants operated by IPPs is estimatedat approximately Rs. 3 billion per annum for 70 per cent ofproject cost serviced by the CEB. Therefore, if theunfavourable terms and conditions are addressed, CEB couldsave approximately Rs. 6 billion per annum.

Further, the loss of 70 per cent of asset value at the endof project life, at current market prices for a 100 MW thermalpower plant operated by IPPs is estimated at Rs. 7 billion.If the 70 per cent of asset value is adjusted for the totalcapacity of power plants operated by IPPs, the CEB couldsave a substantially high amount through retained assets atthe end of project period.

These disadvantageous contracts and arrangements ofIPPs reflect serious faults in existing PPAs which havesignificantly contributed to the losses of CEB and highelectricity prices. Unless these deficiencies are rectified, thecontracting of cheaper sources of energy, including coalpower, may not bring about desired cost reductions inelectricity generation in Sri Lanka. Public –PrivatePartnerships in power generation can bring desirable benefitsonly if such partnerships are based on an open competitivebidding process based on PPAs with a proper risk/ returnsharing basis. While the original contracts would have beenentered into between the IPPs and CEB having taken intoaccount the urgency of the specific situation in the countryat that time, it is now necessary to re-visit the contracts andrevise the conditions so as to provide equal benefits to boththe supplier and the buyer.

voluntary measures mandatory for energyconservation. Under this programme, phasing out ofinefficient lighting practices, use of energy efficiencybuilding codes and mandatory energy managementwill be enforced. However, it should be noted that theconservation of energy and the use of energyproductively for economic development cannot beaffirmed through marginal and micro measures only.A sustainable energy policy will have to be based on aconsistently adopted pricing system of energy whileforcing energy producers to minimise costs byremoving subsidy elements. These are essentialfeatures of a new energy policy to reduce Sri Lanka’senergy costs to a level compatible with competitorcountries and to maintain comparative advantage inproduction.

The regulation of electricity sector is to bebrought under the Public Utilities Commission ofSri Lanka (PUCSL). The modified draft of the Sri LankaElectricity Bill has been granted cabinet approval andit proposes to assign the regulatory reforms in thepower sector to PUCSL. Accordingly, the regulatorypowers held by the Minister in charge of Power areexpected to be transferred to the new authority. Underthe Sri Lanka Electricity Bill, functional business unitsof CEB are separated as independent business unitsin which the accounts and operations can be separatedfrom the rest of the institution. This will enable thecomparison of the performance of each functionalbusiness unit with others in the CEB.

Petroleum

International oil prices remained high andreached a record high level of US dollars 97 a barrel(Brent) in December 2007. The supply and demandfundamentals, as well as geo-political developmentsand speculation have affected oil prices to increase.Limited OPEC and non-OPEC supply growth, lowOPEC spare production capacity, tightness in globalcommercial inventories and worldwide refiningbottlenecks have been the main supply side drivers ofoil price movements. Even with increased prices,continued high demand for petroleum products mainlyin China, India and USA, exerted demand pressure inthe oil markets. The average international crude oilprice (Brent) remained at US dollars 72.40 per barrel,while average price of crude imported by CPC stoodat US dollars 71.96 per barrel in 2007.

The petroleum prices in Sri Lanka were revisedupward in line with the international oil pricesduring 2007. Accordingly, prices of petrol (90 octane),kerosene and diesel were raised by 27 per cent, 42per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, to Rs. 117.00,

Rs. 68.00 and Rs. 75.00 per litre, respectively, in 2007.The 15 per cent VAT on petrol imports was reduced to5 per cent with effect from January 2008 to ease thepressure on consumers. This measure is however,inconsistent with the overall goal of energyconservation through an economically set pricestructure. The growth of consumption of petroleumproducts decelerated in 2007, responding to the pricehike in the year. Kerosene consumption registered anegative growth responding to the substantial priceincrease.The government provided a kerosene subsidyonly to targeted low income groups by providing anadditional grant for kerosene to Samurdhi recipients.

The CPC has implemented several measures toreduce the cost of its oil purchases. The hedging ofoil purchases against price volatility was continued in2007. CPC entered into 6 hedging agreements duringthe year and has gained Rs. 209 million as riskmitigating income during the year. The construction ofa pipeline between Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela oiltank farm has been initiated to improve the efficiencyof delivery of refined oil. A refinery expansion projecthas also been planned at an approximate cost of USdollars 700 million, with a view to further reducing thecost of import of refined petroleum products. Further,the refinery at Sapugaskanda, which was built morethan four decades ago, needs urgent modernizationto increase its efficiency. The government of Iran hasagreed to provide financial and technical support forthis purpose.

Several steps have been taken by thegovernment for the exploration of oil in the MannarBasin. The oil exploration site has been divided into 8blocks and the government has conducted investorawareness programmes and international road shows.Two blocks have been reserved for China and India.International tenders were called for 3 explorationblocks in September 2007 and the final award of thecontracts would be made in the near future.

successful, that would generate enormous economicand social benefits to Sri Lanka.

Transportation

Transportation system plays an important rolein successful implementation of all developmentactivities. The transportation system of Sri Lanka isdominated by road transport, which accounts for about85 per cent of the passenger miles by all modes of publictransport. Government’s plan has been to improveaccessibility to the whole areas of the country throughan efficent and convenient transportation system.

Road Transportation

Road Development

The government has given priority to developnational and rural roads in its infrastructuredevelopment agenda. The government has launchedseveral road development projects to improve mobility,connectivity, and opening access to market, therebyreducing regional disparities. The improvement ofurban-rural connectivity will reduce urbanization andimprove economic efficiency through reduced trafficcongestion in metropolitan areas.

Sri Lanka has an extensive road network; thetotal length of road network is about 117,093 kmcomprising 11,902 km of national highways(classes A and B), 16,532 km of provincial roads(classes C and D), 64,659 km of rural roads (classE) and 24,000 km of roads belonging to estatesand state agencies. The road density of the countryis 1.6 km per square km and it is relatively higher thanthe road density in the South Asian region. However,the main deficiencies prevailing in the road networkare capacity reduction due to intense roadsidedevelopment, particularly in towns and urban areas,poor riding qualities of road surface, weak and narrowbridges and issues relating to traffic management.

Several road development projects werecontinued in 2007. The construction of the SouthernExpressway was in progress in 2007. The funds forthe construction of the road section from Kottawa toKurundugahahethekma and section fromKurundugahahethekma to Godagama have beenalready secured from bilateral and multilateralloans.The Colombo Outer Circular Road, linking sevenhigh priority trunk roads is planned to be constructedas a four-lane access controlled road, which can bewidened up to six-lanes in the future. The landacquisition for the project is underway. The constructionwork of the first section from Kottawa to Kaduwelacommenced in 2007. The land acquisition for theconstruction of the Colombo-Katunayake Expresswaywhich encompasses a 25 km, four-lane expresswayfrom Colombo to Katunayake airport with 5 flyovers,has been finalized. The initiatives have been taken toconstruct the Colombo-Kandy Expressway, a 100 kmfour-lane expressway between Colombo and Kandywith connection to the Outer Circular Road atKadawata. Steps have also been taken to rehabilitateand improve 280 kms of A and B type roads in thenational highway network in the country.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

Southern and Eastern parts of the country was inprogress in 2007. A new highway bridge atManampitiya across the Mahaweli river wasconstructed and opened for traffic in October 2007.Under the Road Network Improvement Project,rehabilitation of 311 kms of roads and 77 bridges werein progress in 2007.

Seventeen flyovers are proposed to beconstructed to avoid traffic congestion in the cityof Colombo and its suburbs. Out of 17, theconstruction of flyovers at Gampaha, Pannipitiya,Orugodawatta and Kelaniya Railway crossing were inprogress in 2007. The construction of proposed flyoversshould be expedited to minimise the traffic congestionin Colombo and suburbs to save energy and time.

Development of rural roads under “MagaNeguma” programme continued in 2007. Under thisprogramme, 6,190 projects were started in 2007. Under“Maga Neguma” programme most of the rural roadsare surfaced with concrete which need lessmaintenance. During the year around 1,202 kms ofrural roads were rehabilitated at a cost of Rs. 2,422million.

Road Passenger Transportation

With various new initiatives, public passengertransportation showed some improvement in 2007.The average number of buses operated per day by SriLanka Transport Board (SLTB) increased by 9 per centto 4,127. The average number of buses operated bythe private sector however decreased by 2 per cent in2007. The total operated kilometres and passengerkilometres of SLTB increased by 16 per cent and 15per cent, respectively, during the year. Meanwhile, thenew registrations of motor vehicles in 2007 decreasedmarginally. The registration of passenger buses toodecreased by 21 per cent in 2007.

Several projects were launched in 2007 toaddress the existing issues in the sector.Inadequate and poor quality of service, increasingnumber of accidents and weak enforcement ofregulations were some of the continuing key issues inthe bus passenger transport service. Severalprogrammes have been launched to address theseissues. As 35 per cent of total private buses were over10 years old, a Re-fleet Subsidy project wasimplemented in 2007. The objective of this project isto improve the quality of bus service by replacing oldbuses with new buses and to strengthen the ruraltransport services. The “Nisi Seriya” night time busservice, “Sisu Seriya” school bus service and “GemiSeriya” to provide transport facilities in uneconomic,remote areas were continued.

Bus fares were revised from July 2007. As perthe national bus fares policy, passenger bus fares wereincreased by an average rate of 17.5 per cent, mainlyto compensate the increases in fuel prices. Acommittee has been appointed by the NationalTransport Commission (NTC) to recalibrate the busoperation cost index with a view to make fare revisionmore realistic.

The financial position of SLTB continued to beweak. The revenue of SLTB for the year 2007increased by 21 per cent to Rs. 15,036 million mainlydue to increased bus fares. As operating cost alsoincreased by 14 per cent during the year, the operatingloss amounted to Rs. 1,966 million compared toRs.2,542 million in the previous year. The governmentgrants to SLTB as bus-season subsidy, uneconomicroute subsidy and other school bus projects amountedto Rs. 358 million in 2007.

Railway Transportation

The performance of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR)did not show a significant improvement in 2007.Passenger transportation increased by 4.5 per cent,while goods transportation increased by 6.3 per centduring this period. The railway network of Sri Lankaconsists of 1,640 kilometres, but operates only 1,200kilometres due to the closure of several sections inthe North and the East. SLR contributes around 6 percent to total passenger transport and 1 per cent togoods transport in the country which are insignificant,compared with the performance of the nationaltransportation sector.

Several programmes are being implemented toaddress urgent issues in the rail transportation.Major issues in the railway sector are weak integrationwith road transportation, obsolete signalling andcommunication systems, dilapidated railwayinfrastructure, shortages of sleepers, engines andcoaches, low quality carriages, issues relating to safety,reliability and punctuality, lack of flexible pricing policyand lack of ancillary services. To address some of theseissues, the government has decided to import 15 dieselmultiple units and 100 carriages to improve the railwayoperations. 75 carriages at a cost of Rs. 30 million eachwere purchased in 2007. New diesel multiple unitsare expected to be in service in 2008. Steps have alsobeen taken to purchase 3 railway engines to streamlinefuel transport.

It has been planned to expand the railwaynetwork. Initiatives have been taken to construct 420kilometres of new railway lines between Matara andKataragama (112 km), from Kurunegala up to

Habarana via Dambulla (80 km), extending the KelaniValley line up to Hambantota via Padukka, Ratnapura,Embilipitiya (210 km) and Horana to Panadura (18 km).The construction of several railway bridges under abilateral credit facility was completed in 2007,enhancing safety of the passengers and increasing itsefficiency. This credit facility has been extended toconstruct several other bridges at Nilwala, Bentota,Unawatuna, Kataluwa and Midigama. The privatesector participation has been called upon to renovaterailway stations and develop selected stations asservice centres.The financial position of SLR has furtherweakened in 2007. The total revenue increased toRs. 2,999 million, but current expenditure increasedfaster to Rs. 7,297 million, resulting in a large operatingloss, which increased by 8 per cent to Rs. 4,297 millionin 2007. SLR has not adjusted its fares since August2005, even though the diesel price has since increasedby 50 per cent. Hence, it is necessary to introduce acost recovery and flexible pricing policy, includingpricing of season tickets, as the loss of SLR is a directburden on the taxpayers.

A comprehensive strategic plan for SLR isurgently needed to address the above problemsand to enhance mass transportation to supportenergy and space savings in the wake of rising oilprices. Modernising railway infrastructure, possibleelectrification of rail tracks, constructing a dedicatedrailway service to the Katunayake airport, developingan Inter-model transport system connecting sea ports,airports and other road bound transport systems andfacilitating freight transportation by rail should be givenpriority in the strategic plan.

SLR and SLTB own a large number ofcommercially valuable properties in major cities.These properties can be developed to provide betterservices to the public through PPP thereby reducingthe burden of such developments to the state.

Civil Aviation

The performance of the civil aviation sector washindered by the slow down in the tourism sectordue to the security situation. A total of 5 million airpassengers were served at the BandaranaikeInternational Airport (BIA) in 2007, a 4 per centincrease over the number of passengers in 2006.However, air freight has decreased by 6 per cent duringthe year. The share of the national carrier, SriLankanAirlines, in passenger and freight operations was 64per cent and 62 per cent, respectively, in 2007. Thedomestic air passenger transportation reflected asignificant recovery and passenger kilometres grewby three fold during 2007.

Several steps have been taken to furtherdevelop the civil aviation sector in the country.Mihin Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd., a budget airline, fully ownedby the government, commenced its operations in 2007.However, it is necessary to maintain this airline on acommercially viable basis through a well-preparedbusiness plan comparable with those of the otherbudget airlines in the region, so as to avoid it frombecoming an additional burden to the budget.Meanwhile, operations of SriLankan Airlines furtherextended its services to cover 54 destinations in 28countries across the globe. Sri Lanka participated intwo bilateral air services negotiations with China andAustralia. The Phase II, Stage I of the BandaranaikeInternational Airport Development Project (BIADP) hasbeen completed and preliminary work for Phase II,Stage II was commenced in 2007. The completion ofthis project enables BIA to serve 12 million passengersper annum. Initial steps have been taken to constructa second international airport at Weerawila.

Port Services

Port services showed a significant growth in2007. The total cargo handling recorded a 9 per centgrowth in 2007 compared to 2006. The port of Colomborecorded the highest ever annual container throughputin its history in 2007. It has increased by 10 per centto 3.4 million Twenty-foot Equivalent container Units(TEUs), while total ship arrivals has increased by 5per cent to 4,710. The healthy export and import growthduring the year and productivity improvements throughincreasing berth and yard capacity, replacing oldcranes with modern ones and introduction of a newterminal management system have supported thesedevelopments.

Recognising the important contribution of theport sector to the economy and to meet thegrowing competition for port services in the region,necessary steps have been taken to implementseveral port development projects. The constructionof the Colombo Port Expansion Project (CPEP) hasbeen given priority, as capacity limitations at the portcould lead to loss of its market share in transshipment.The CPEP includes construction of a breakwatersufficient to accommodate three terminals, dredging,establishment of a new marine operations centre,relocation of a submarine oil pipeline etc. Aftercompletion of the project, it is expected to increasethe current container handling capacity up to 5.7 millionTEUs by 2010 and further to 8.1 million TEUs by 2015.

Several regional port development projectswere also in progress in 2007. The Galle portdevelopment by constructing an outer breakwater tofacilitate the berth of large vessels and a new multi-purpose terminal to meet the future demand and to

reallocate bulk cargo handling from the port ofColombo, commenced with a loan provided under abilateral arrangement. The new terminal will help toreduce the waiting time of vessels, and will cater tolarge vessels. Furthermore, the project will greatlyfacilitate the Southern area development plan, whichis presently being implemented. Basic infrastructurefacilities required for the new Hambantota Sea PortDevelopment project are being provided. As theinternational shipping routes fall closer to theHambantota port, the port is expected to be morecompetitive on cargo handling as well as the supply ofother ancillary services. The first phase of the projectis expected to commence by 2010. At the same time,the Oluvil Port Development Project was also inprogress in 2007.

Water Supply and Irrigation

As water is a basic need for human life,every human being should have the right toaccess to safe drinking water. The investmentsmade on the supply of safe drinking water andadequate sanitation facilities would cut downexpenditure on health, as water-borne diseaseslead to most of the health complications. Inrecognition of the importance of providing safedrinking water and adequate sanitation facilities,a seperate Ministry for water supply and drainagewas formed in 2007. The total budgetary allocationfor this sector amounted to Rs. 27,330 million in2007.

Sri Lanka has achieved relatively a higherstandard in supply of drinking water compared tomany developing countries, but several key issuescontinue to remain. As at present, around 85 per centof the population has access to safe drinking water, ofwhich 32 per cent had access to pipe borne water.The key issue in the water sector is the high level ofNon-Revenue Water due to leakages, illegalconnections, metering errors and un-metered waysidestand posts. Non-Revenue Water amounted to 37.9per cent in the Greater Colombo area while it was 26.6per cent in the regions outside the Greater Colomboarea, indicating the need for urgent action to reducethe losses.

Several water supply projects wereimplemented during 2007 to improve the capacity,quality and water distribution. Kalu Ganga WaterSupply Scheme Phase I Stage I, Rehabilitation andAugmentation of Labugama-Kalatuwawa WaterTreatment Plant, Augmentation of Negombo WaterSupply Scheme, Greater Kurunegala Water Supplyand Sanitation Project, Rehabilitation andAugmentation of Kirindi Oya Water Supply Schemeare some of such projects, which received specialattention. The construction work of the Greater KandyWater Supply Augmentation Project (Phase I Stage I)was completed by the National Water Supply andDrainage Board (NWS&DB) and Phase I Stage II ofthe project was commenced. The Towns South ofKandy Water Supply Project was commenced in 2007.The construction of Nuwara Eliya District Group WaterSupply Project, which covers water supply forGinigathhena, Hatton, Maskeliya, Ragala, etc., alsocommenced in 2007 and will be completed by February2009. Several other projects, namely Greater GalleWater Supply Augmentation Scheme Stage I,

Improvements to Water Supply Schemes in MataraDistrict, Hikkaduwa Coastal Zone Waste ManagementProject, Towns North of Colombo Water SupplyScheme Stage I were completed in 2007.

The drafting of legislation to strengthen theregulatory framework for water supply andsanitation by the PUCSL was started in 2007, withthe support of ADB. The main objective of thistechnical assistance was to develop regulations for thewater sector within the framework of the PUCSL Actto facilitate credible and independent, autonomous,accountable and transparent regulations for theNWS&DB. With the introduction of regulation for thewater services industry, PUCSL will take theresponsibility for tariff and financial regulation, technicalregulation and customer service regulation of theNWS&DB. Within this environment, NWS&DB will beable to improve its operational and financial efficiency,while providing a high quality customer service.

The irrigation sector contributessubstantially to the economy, throughincreasing the productivity in the agriculturesector. However, key issues such as inadequatemaintenance, lack of modernization of waterallocation systems and inadequate investmentcontinue to exist in the irrigation sector. Theabsense of an appropriate system to value thewater supplied through irrigation systems has ledfor extensive wastage of water. The government isimplementing several mega irrigation projects toincrease supply of irrigation water. The constructionof Moragahakanda reservoir project andRambukkan Oya project were commenced in 2007.

3.3Social Infrastructure Policies,Institutional Framework andPerformance

Sri Lanka has achieved a remarkable progressin social indicators as reflected in low maternaland infant mortality, higher primary schoolenrolment, gender equality in education and higherliteracy. Sri Lanka has ranked 99 out of 177 countriesin 2005 in Human Development Index (HDI), in thelatest Human Development Report 2007/08. However,Sri Lanka has not yet reaped its fullest potential in thesphere of health and education to reach theinternationally competitive levels. Education and healthservices have an untapped potential to enter the globalmarket by enhancing the relevancy, quality andaccessibility, as Sri Lanka has a comparativeadvantage in these areas.

Health

Over the years Sri Lanka has accomplishedsome of the health goals stated in the HealthMaster Plan and reasonable improvements in thehealth status of its people. In achieving these goals,the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition has initiated anumber of programmes of health development throughits network of institutions. However, one of the mainissues faced by the health sector is the imbalance inhuman resources, particularly in view of acute shortageof specialists in the rural areas to provide the requiredservices to people. To address these issues, theMinistry has taken some measures to provide humanresources to less privileged areas.

The government continues to support its longstanding-policy of providing universal healthservices free of charge to its people, at allgovernment health institutions. In 2007, the totalhealth budget increased by 18 per cent to Rs. 69 billionwhich was about 1.9 per cent of GDP. There are 619government hospitals with 66,866 beds in the country,which accounts to 3 beds per 1,000 persons. Therewere 11,442 qualified doctors in the state health sector,a doctor for every 1,749 persons and 22,088 qualifiednurses, a nurse for every 906 persons. Over the years,the government has allowed the steady growth of theprivate sector, while increasingly focusing on its ownfacilities to low income groups. However, thegovernment has an overall responsibility to ensure thatpatients are protected and get the value for money.Accordingly, the Private Health Services RegulatoryCouncil was established, which was vested withregulatory powers to regulate the private sector healthservice providers.

A re-emergence of certain communicablediseases and a rising trend of non-communicablediseases threaten the achievements in the healthsector. Health Ministry has actively engaged in takingmeasures to eradicate communicable diseases suchas Dengue Haemorrhage fever, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Health Ministry recently launched animmunization programme for Hepatitis Influenza Bepidemic. However, further actions need to be takento educate the public on prevention. At the same time,primary and curative care follow-up activities withscreening of diseases and work towards patient andfamily-centred promotion and prevention should be inplace. In recent years, the incidence of non-communicable diseases is seen increasingly. Amongnon-communicable diseases, mental disorders occupya significant place. Mortality due to non-communicablediseases such as heart diseases, strokes and cancer

is increasing. At the same time, certain emergingdiseases and conditions such as accidents, suicidesand homicides too show a clearly increasing trend.

Providing a high standard of health facilitiesfree of charge has become a challenging task overthe years due to budgetary constraints. Theincreasing cost of providing other services such ascontrolling the emerging and re-emerging diseases andpromoting preventive healthcare facilities haveincreased the budgetary allocation. It has beenreported that a significant quantity of medicine providedby the government hospitals free of charge is notadministered by the patients properly and is wastedas they do not know the economic value or the cost ofsuch medicines. Hence, it is important to educate thepublic of the economic value of free health servicesprovided by the government and make it voluntary forhigh income groups who obtain public health servicesto pay full or part of the costs incurred by thegovernment when they are treated at public healthinstitutions. Funds generated through this exercise canbe utilized to upgrade the quality of the existing healthservices.

Over the years, the state sector health careinstitutions have emerged as quality serviceproviders when compared with the private sectorhealth care institutions. It is the medical and technicalstaff attached to state hospitals that basically serve inthe private hospitals. Taking this reputation intoaccount, the base hospitals in the state sector couldrun fee-levying wards where patients in an upper

Several health projects were in progress in2007. The basic nurses training certificate course hasbeen upgraded to a diploma course and the Ministryhas worked towards its target of training 15,000 nursesduring 2005-2007. In addition to the internal funds, tomobilize foreign funds and assistance, the Ministry ofHealthcare and Nutrition has entered intoMemorandums of Understanding with donor agenciessuch as World Health Organization (WHO), UnitedNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), JapaneseInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) etc. toimplement various health projects.

Education

Sri Lanka has been ranked high on theachievements in education in terms of high literacyrate, high levels of primary school enrolment aswell as gender parity in access to education andachievements, when compared to other countriesin the region. The policy of providing education freeof charge from grade one to university level, sufficientlyhigh school density and other welfare programmessuch as free textbooks, implemented for decades havecontributed to these achievements. Though Sri Lankahas achieved remarkable standards in education, thereare several weaknesses, which should be addressedthrough a coordinated and continuing reform agenda.The need for further improving secondary schoolachievements, below average performance incompetitive subjects like Mathematics and Science,low competence in English, poor exposure toinformation technology, unequal distribution ofavailable resources are some of the major issues facedby the general education sector.

The government continued the EducationSector Development Framework and Programme(ESDF), which has four over-arching goals:increasing equitable access to basic andsecondary education, improving education quality,enhancing the economic efficiency and equity ofresource allocation and distribution andstrengthening governance and service delivery.The ESDF is implemented as a five year rolling plan,and has a strategic focus on enhancing learningoutcomes, especially in skills development. A total of22,000 unemployed graduates were recruited to theteaching service under the Graduate EmploymentScheme. These recruits were granted basic trainingfor 21 days to adjust them for classroom teaching fromthe education faculties of universities. Though thiscould be viewed as an urgent measure, it is necessaryto train these teachers properly in order to maintainthe long-term sustainability and quality of the publicschool system. Teacher development programmes andupgrading of teachers’ training colleges were continuedin 2007. With the active contribution of the NationalInstitute of Education, the Teachers’ College curricula

The university education system in Sri Lanka, which isvery largely a state owned monopoly, now comprises 15universities operating under the University Act No. 16 of1978 and 16 undergraduate and postgraduate degreeawarding institutions come under the purview of theUniversity Grants Commission (UGC). UGC set up underthe University Act, is solely responsible for planning andcoordinating of university education, selecting of studentsfor state universities, allocating public funds to highereducation institutions and maintaining academic standardsin state universities. Admission to university education inSri Lanka is extremely competitive, and not more than 14per cent of those who qualify for university education couldgain admission to a university.

Outside the UGC system, a large number of privateinstitutions, on collaboration with foreign universities, havebeen given Board of Investment approval, too offer degreeprogrammes in Sri Lanka. They cater to those who areunable to enter a state university in Sri Lanka or afford tofinance university education abroad. The educationstandards and quality of these institutions are not assuredby any regulatory authority in Sri Lanka. Reports on someof these institutions indicate that they are affiliated todubious institutions abroad.

Foreign universities in developed countries and in somedeveloping countries such as India, Nepal, Bangladesh andChina serve as a “ safety valve” for Sri Lankan studentswho cannot gain admission to a local university. This typeof private investment in human capital investment isefficient in terms of economics, since it is demand drivenand made only after a careful analysis of private returns toeducation. This is in contrast to a basically supply drivenpublic university education where students follow coursesthat are offered to them and are not on the basis of futureprivate returns. The inevitable corollary is that the foreigngraduates get picked up by employers, leaving a vast arrayof local graduates unemployed, making it necessary forthe government to employ them eventually as the“employer of last resort”.

The existing higher education system in the country facesserious problems due both to its quantitative and qualitativelimitations. Quantitative limitations arise due to the limitedcapacity in universities to accommodate all those aspiringfor the university education. Qualitative limitations aretwo-fold: viability of the system to produce graduates infields needed by the economy, and failure to ensure qualityassurance in the degree programmes to be on par with those

offered by reputed international universities. Some of thekey problems include lack of focus on knowledge, skillsand attitudes; absence of a consistent overall policy foruniversity education; inadequate coordination and linkagesamong public, private and non-governmental stakeholders;inadequate linkages between university education andTechnical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET);low quality and irrelevance to meet local needs and failureto be on par with international standards; paucity of researchwork; lack of private sector participation; and frequentdisruption of university activities due to short sightedpolitical goals of some of the students.

One of the major problems of the university education inSri Lanka is the mismatch between the supply and thedemand. The country has a supply driven universityeducation system with insignificant relevance to labourmarket and economic requirements. About 32 per cent ofthe students admitted to local universities study socialsciences and humanities and a significant proportion of suchgraduates find it difficult to obtain productive employment;they remain unemployed or underemployed for a longperiod of time leading to frustration and creating socialproblems. Financial or resource constraints also limit theimprovement of university education. Given the highburden on the budget, other competing needs often getpriority for public goods allocation, leaving universityeducation static in terms of GDP which presently stands at0.5 per cent. Hence, universities will have to find alternativefunding sources to supplement the funding by thegovernment.

The university education system in Sri Lanka continues tofunction within a government control regulatoryframework. The system is highly centralized. There is anurgent need for introducing a market oriented efficientmechanism to the existing university education system. Atthe same time, it needs a quality assurance rating systemas well to help parents and students to make informedchoices regarding university education. To compeluniversities to upgrade and maintain quality, governmentgrading could be based on the quality rating obtained byuniversities. Such a competitive environment is necessaryto promote academic and research excellence ofuniversities.

Funding is one of the major obstacles since the universityeducation solely depends on government funds. Given thegrowing fiscal constraints, alternative sources of fundingfor higher education need to be explored. In this respect,

cost-sharing mechanisms to generate additional fundswould be useful. All students could be provided with astatement, which indicates the value of the courses offeredby the university. Those who can afford may thencontribute full or part of the value, on an entirely voluntarybasis. A students’ loans scheme could also be arranged tofacilitate these efforts. However, such innovations wouldbe constrained by the existing administrative and financialregulations at university level. Overall, the existingadministrative system needs to be reformed withoutcompromising academic standards, quality, responsibilityand examination integrity. Though universities alreadyenjoy a considerable autonomy, time consumingadministrative procedures result in inefficiency and lowerrevenue that could be generated through consultancy,research activities, and study programmes.Entrepreneurial orientation at the university education isanother potential avenue for alternative funding as wellas for attracting foreign students at least from South Asiancountries. Sri Lanka can grasp examples from India,Bangladesh and Pakistan in this context. Though the SriLankan economy is open to foreign direct investments,the education sector is lagging behind and investmentopportunities in the sector are implicitly restricted.All state funded universities could, in addition to trainingtheir own internal students, accredit other institutions todeliver their courses and prepare the students to face theirapproved evaluation criteria to obtain a degree, which ispermitted by University Act No.16 of 1978. The concept“University for All” requires all the state universities toactively engage in training both internal and external

students. It would help universities to expand their outreachand universalize access to higher education. Meanwhile, itis necessary to impress upon the internal students that theintroduction of external degrees and off-campus studentsis not privatization of universities or higher education buta creation of Public Private partnership (PPP) to safeguardthe fundamental right of all students who pass the advancedlevel to pursue higher studies.

Increasing private investments in the university educationcould produce greater benefits including enhanced accessto university education. While it would increase theresource mobilization to the university education, it wouldalso help improve the quality of education with theincreased competitiveness. Creating a favourableenvironment for private investment in university educationrequires developing new legislation, regulations andaccreditation policies. The government could seekalternative methods to encourage private investment inuniversity education such as establishment of private degreeawarding colleges/institutions in selected disciplines withquality maintained at high standards, establishment ofaffiliated university colleges, provision of infrastructurefacilities, establishment of joint or collaborative degrees,scholarships and research programmes with publicuniversities, etc. In the meantime, the existing universityeducation system could be improved with proposed andongoing reforms targeted at quality improvement,expanding the availability of opportunities for universityeducation, and creating a more competitive environmentas well.

are being revised and a professional developmentprogramme was implemented for the academic staffin teachers’ colleges. A systematic scheme has beenprepared by the Ministry of Education for balancing ofteacher resources in the country-wide school network.

The tertiary education system has not beensufficently geared up to face the challenges of adynamic, market-oriented economy. In particular, theexisting university education system in Sri Lanka hasnot kept pace with the developments in other sectorsand remained far behind the world standards. Thoughthere is a significant development in the vocationaltraining programmes they are also mostly supplydriven, rather than focusing on the labour demand ofthe public and private sectors.

Higher education sector continued to sufferfrom inherited weaknesses. In addition to the lowquality and low standards of higher education, the

system has been able to cater to only 14 per cent ofthe qualified students. This has resulted in a largenumber of unsuccessful students with ability to paymaking use of higher education facilities in foreigncountries. The private sector investments in humandevelopment in this manner is an encouraging sign.Unlike the public sector supply driven humandevelopment, private investments in this sector wouldbe made after a careful assessment of the demand,rate of return on education and future employability ofgraduates both in Sri Lanka and abroad. When theyare employed abroad, since their families stay back athome, there will be a continuous flow of privateremittances to the country, thereby easing the gap inthe current account of the balance of payments.However, Sri Lanka should also harness itscomparative advantage in education by permittingprivate institutions to invest in building human capitalthrough enhancing opportunities for higher education.

The quality assurance of such institutions wouldbasically be made by parents who pay for the servicesby subjecting them to market discipline. To facilitate it,an internationally comparable rating system throughprivate initiative could be promoted.

The university admission procedure is morebiased towards social sciences and humanities.Considering the supply side of the state universities,about 32 per cent of the students admitted to localuniversities study social sciences and humanities anda substantial proportion of such graduates find it difficultto obtain productive employment; they remainunemployed or underemployed for a long periodaggravating the problem of educated unemploymentand frustration and social problems of various sorts.With respect to graduate unemployment, one of themajor problems in Sri Lanka is the mismatch betweensupply and demand. The country has a supply driveneducation system with little relevance to labour marketconditions and to entrepreneurial culture.

Since the education service is provided free ofcharge from grade 1 to the university level,students are not aware of the expenditure incurredby the government on them. It is important to createawareness among university students, at the time ofboth enrolling and graduating about the financial valueof their university education in terms of the value ofthe education provided by the government, with a viewto induce them to strive for academic excellence anda reasonable return on investment.

Housing and Urban Development

The Ten-Year Horizon Development Frameworkemphasises the importance of sheltering thenation through an adoption of new parametersbased on criteria such as population density, landsuitability and environmental sustainability.Therefore, housing development should take intoaccount the changing lifestyle of people, demand foramenities, nature of livelihood and other determinants.Adoption of vertical development approach in urbanareas and retaining dispersal developments in ruralareas is needed. The participation of both the publicand private sector is also equally important for thesmooth implementation of housing programmes, whileminimising cross-cutting issues. Meanwhile, thedevelopment strategy of the housing sector highlightsthe need of a well functioning mortgage finance systemincluding a secondary mortgage market, which cancater to the housing needs of the public.

Several key issues remained as challenges forthe development of the housing sector. A lack of

coordination and consistence between facilitatingagencies is one of the bottlenecks faced by the housingsector. The shortage of suitable lands for residentialpurpose in urban areas, rapid escalation of the valueof lands in major cities and suburbs, blocking out andselling lands by private developers without properutilities, poor maintenance of urban housing schemesand burden on the government to maintain them anda lack of skilled labour in the construction sectorconstrainted the development of the housing sector.

The Urban Development Authority (UDA)initiated several mega projects throughout thecountry with special attention to the backwardregions of the country. In 2007, major projectsimplemented included the Greater HambantotaDevelopment, Greater Dambulla Development,Greater Galle Development, Trincomalee MetroDevelopment would act as catalysts for urbandevelopment in these regions while facilitating the ruraldevelopment of the surrounding areas. Totalexpenditure on urban development projects amountedto Rs. 984 billion in 2007.

Poverty Alleviation: Safety Nets Vs Safety Ropes

There is a widespread consensus on theimportance of safety nets as a key component of apublic poverty reduction strategy. Safety netscomprise policy and programme instruments such asgeneral food subsidies, targeted income transfers,school feeding and small scale funds. They aredesigned to reduce poverty and to protect the incomeentitlements of vulnerable groups. Sri Lanka enjoysthe most extensive social protection programme inSouth Asia and Samurdhi is the main safety netprogramme implemented by the government. Whilesafety nets are important to prevent the poor fromfacing greater depths, they should be accompaniedby safety ropes, to help them to cross the poverty linewithin a given period of time. In the absence of such

Samurdhi programme was streamlined furtherin 2007 and the total allocation for the Samurdhiprogramme was Rs. 9,600 million in 2007. Theprogramme was streamlined with the help of a newselection procedure named “Janasbaha”. Under thenew selection process only the deserving beneficiarieswere selected for Samurdhi relief with therecommendation of representatives from respectivevillages. Previously about 40 per cent of the populationenjoyed Samurdhi relief though the existing povertylevel is around 15.2 per cent (As per Household Incomeand Expenditure Survey - 2006/07 conducted by theDepartment of Census and Statistics). The newselection process targeting the needy groups hasreduced the number to an estimated 38 per cent ofthe population indicating the need for improving thetargeting. Given the continued high budgetary cost ofthe Samurdhi programme, it is necessary to link thepoor to the properly designed safety ropesprogrammes to enable them to exit poverty and therebybecome responsible citizens in the mainstream socio-economic political life. It is time now to re-visit theSamurdhi programme with improving it on the basis ofthe ultimate goal of eradicating poverty.

Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka has launchedseveral programmes for community developmentand capacity building. “The Jathika Saviya GamPubudu Livelihood Development Programme” and“Jathika Saviya Gama Neguma AwarenessProgramme” etc. were continued in 2007. Theseprogrammes had focused on rural development toupgrade the living standards of the poor families and

infrastructure development at village level. Theallocation for Economic Infrastructure and RuralDevelopment programme was Rs. 1,127 million in2007.

Environment

A sustainable economic growth with minimumdamages to environment should be a nationalpriority. As most economic activities could haveenvironmental implications, it is important to strike abalance between economic development andenvironment protection. Though there is a wide rangeof policies, laws and regulations in place, there aresome weaknesses in the enforcement. As a controlmethod, fiscal and financial instruments are widelyused in many countries. In recent years, Sri Lankaalso has taken some initiatives to use economicinstruments such as taxes in managing theenvironment.

Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA),which is a sustainability assessment of a proposedpolicy, a programme or a plan, is a tool effectivelyused worldwide to assess consequences of aproposed policy or a development project and toincorporate their findings to such policies. TheCentral Environment Authority (CEA) in Sri Lanka alsohas taken action to prepare SEA in assessing theenvironmental impact of major development projectssuch as Trincomalee Development Plan. The CEA hasissued orders prohibiting manufacture or use ofpolythene or any other polythene product of 20 micronsor below in thickness with effect from 1st January 2007.Management of solid waste, especially Municipal solidwaste is a growing problem in urban areas of Sri Lankamainly due to absence of a proper managementsystem.

“Carbon Trading” is an international market set up totackle global warming by trading the reductions ofemissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) at competitiveprices.1 The greenhouse effect is one of Earth’s naturalprocesses that helps to regulate the temperature of ourplanet2. However, an atmospheric imbalance, in the formof an over-concentration of GHGs, would have disastrousconsequences on the ecosystem, including human beings,as the earth would be warmer and the sea level would rise.The higher level of human activity from around the 18thCentury, particularly, the generation of electricity throughthe combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and naturalgases, releases the carbon that has been stored in them overthe years. This has raised the concentration of GHGs inthe atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), to 360particles per million (ppm) from 280 ppm recorded in thePre-Industrial Era. This has led to global warming, whichin turn, has led to changes in the Earth’s climate. If thepresent trend continues, by 2100, the Earth’s averagetemperature could rise by about 1.5 – 5.0 degrees Celsius,as a result of which, the sea level may rise by as much as 1metre, submerging almost 3 per cent of the world’s landarea. As a result, the global community has considered

Carbon Trading

climate change as a serious issue affecting human beings.3

In view of this, the United Nations adopted the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC) in 1992, to stabilize the anthropogenicgreenhouse gases at a level that will not have adverseimpacts. Under the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol4 wasadopted in 1997 to cut 5.2 per cent of overall GHGemissions of industrialized countries and created “CarbonTrading” as an economic instrument to cut back on theproduction of GHGs, which in turn, is expected to reduceglobal warming.

How is Carbon Trading done?

Under the Kyoto Protocol, 39 developed countries weregiven various emissions reductions targets: i.e., USA - 7per cent, Europe – 8 per cent, Japan – 6 per cent, etc. fromtheir 1990 levels of emissions. They could reduce theiremissions levels through International Emissions Trading,Joint Implementation, or Clean Development Mechanism(CDM). Among them, CDM is the only mechanismrelevant to developing countries like Sri Lanka.5 CDMinvolves the implementation of a project that reducesemissions or absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, by an entityin a developing country. The emissions reductions are then

3The 2007/2008 Human Development Report (HDR) has identified climate changeas the most important human development challenge of the 21st Century. It arguesthat climate change poses many challenges including the effective management ofthe environment in the Earth, initiating deep and early cuts in GHGs emissions andundertaking prompt and strong collective action based on shared values and a sharedvision.

4The Kyoto Protocol is an outcome of a meeting held in Kyoto, Japan in 1997 todiscuss the causes and consequences of climate change and methods by which theseissues could be addressed.

5International Emissions Trading involves developed countries wherein those withsurpluses of carbon credits trade with those that are in deficit. Joint Implementationenables developed countries with relatively high costs of domestic GHG reduction,to set up projects in other developed countries that have relatively lower costs, suchthat the GHG reductions of the project in the latter are counted towards the emis-sions reductions of the former.

1As sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, its energy is captured by theEarth's surface, land, water, and biosphere and re-emitted back into the atmosphere.While much of this energy passes back into space, some of it is absorbed by watervapour and certain other gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, ozone,nitrous oxide, and methane. These gases, which prevent heat from escaping backinto space, are called the greenhouse gases, (named after “greenhouses”, which areartificial enclosures which enable the maintenance of temperatures required forvegetation in cold climates), because they heat up our world.

2The rise in temperature that the Earth experiences because of the GHGs is calledthe Greenhouse Effect. Without these gases, the Earth’s average temperature isestimated to be about 60 degrees Farenheit (approximately 35 degrees Celsius)colder (Environmental Protection Agency, USA).

authorities, investors and other stakeholders. The NonGovernment Forum was held in 2007 to implement acoordinated network to obtain their active participationin environmental management and protection.Meanwhile, the CEA has launched public awarenessprogrammes for various target groups to obtain theirparticipation in environment conservation.The Budget 2008 proposed to introduce anEnvironment Conservation Levy Act to promoteenvironment conservation. The CEA has beenvested with the powers to impose and collect theEnvironment Conservation Levy. Individual businesses

or items considered as harmful to the environment willbe subjected to the Environment Conservation Levy.Provisions are available in the Act to impose the levyon any item or business, which is considered as harmfulto the environment. Some of such items are, electricand electronic equipment, batteries, asbestos etc.Green Cess on plastic products has already beenimposed in Sri Lanka and it is proposed to extend theGreen Cess to other identified products. Green surchargeis proposed to be imposed on environmentally unfriendlyproducts, which have environment friendly alternatives.

measured and bundled together as carbon credits. Each10,000 tons of CO2 that is saved makes up one carbon credit.These carbon credits are then sold to entities in developedcountries for them to meet their emissions reduction targets.

•Buyers: Any entity, typically the government, businessor individual in the 39 developed countries, which arerequired to abide by the emissions targets. This includesentities in the developed countries which may be facingvarious constraints to reducing GHG emissions, whichmay be better off purchasing the carbon credits earnedby sellers of carbon credits in developing countries.

•Sellers: These are the entities that deliberately reduceGHG emissions in developing countries. This could beachieved through the implementation of renewableenergy projects instead of those that promote thecombustion of fossil fuels. For example, implementationof projects that are fuelled by wind power, hydropower,biomass, etc. would result in the accumulation of carboncredits.

Ideally, all firms in the 39 developed countries shouldcut emissions by the specified amount. However, in reality,the companies face different constraints which would makeit more difficult and costlier for some of the companies tocommit to their emissions reduction goals. Due to the natureof their activities, some may find it much easier to loweremissions by even more than the legally binding level, at arelatively lower cost. Those who cannot reduce theiremissions more cheaply could purchase carbon credits fromthose who implement carbon reducing projects indeveloping countries, at a cost which is less than what theywould have had to spend in order to comply with theiremissions targets. This would entail a win-win solution toan environmental problem as the overall emissions are cut,whilst total cost would be reduced. However, problems ofcomplexity, monitoring, enforcement, and potential disputesin the initial allocation methods and cap are often cited asconstraints for emissions trading.

How Sri Lanka can benefit from Carbon Trading?

Sri Lanka’s national emissions limitation commitmentfor 2008-2012 period is less than 1 ton per capita, which islower than the world average of 4 tons per capita.6 Indeveloped countries such as the United States, the limitationcommitment is 20 tons per capita. This vast differencecreates a market which offers a significant potential for SriLanka to benefit from carbon trading activities.

Power generation is one of the main sources of CO2emissions. It accounts for four in every ten tons of CO2dispatched to earth’s atmosphere. For example, a singlemegawatt renewable energy power plant using bio-mass,is capable of saving up to about 5,000 tons of carbon dioxideper year; i.e., every kilowatt hour of electricity generatedby the renewable energy power plant can save up to 0.63kg of CO2 in Sri Lanka.7 Currently, each carbon ton that issaved, fetches about 15 to 20 euros (US dollars 20 to 27) inthe international market. By implementing pollution controltechnology, Sri Lanka’s industries could reduce CO2emissions further. As such, carbon trading could turn outto be a new income source for the country. Budget 2008has indicated that Sri Lanka could reduce around 3 milliontons of CO2 emissions per year, which could be a valuablesource of foreign exchange earnings for the country. Powergeneration (hydro, wind, solar), biomass, energyconservation, transportation, municipal solid waste disposaland forestry are the major areas that have been identifiedas potential areas that could benefit from CDM in Sri Lanka.

However, Sri Lanka is still in the initial stage of CDMproject implementation compared to many other developingcountries. There are only a very few CDM projectsregistered from Sri Lanka which includes mini hydro powerprojects and renewable energy projects that are selling theircarbon credits to developed countries8 .

A Carbon Fund for Sri Lanka

As Sri Lanka is a small country, the CDM projects arerelatively small. These small projects are not attractive tothe international buyers. However, when pooled or bundledtogether, this risk could be mitigated. Thus, the setting upof a Carbon Fund for Sri Lanka, as proposed in Budget2008, would encourage and facilitate Sri Lankanindustrialists to undertake emission reduction projects. TheCarbon Fund would be a part of the proactive strategy tobe implemented by the government to reap benefits fromthis source. It will provide overall support for the countryto enter into the global CDM market through the provisionof financial and technical assistance.

6 Environmental Management Consultants

7Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources

8Under the present arrangements, project proposals must be sent to the Ministry ofEnvironment and Natural Resources which submits them to the Executive Board ofthe CDM (EB/CDM). Once the projects are approved, the operational activities ofthe project are audited by independent firms certified by the UNFCCC ExecutiveBoard, to verify the quantity of carbon reductions, using internationally acceptedmethodologies. These audit firms would report back to the EB/CDM, based on whichthe EB/CDM issues carbon certificates to the local companies. The local companiescould then go through one of several environmental consulting firms or approach theCarbon Fund to sell its carbon credits to the developed countries which wish topurchase them.
