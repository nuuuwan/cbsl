It would generate new employmentopportunities and finally, support sustainableeconomic growth. The strategy adopted by Sri Lankafor economic and social infrastructure developmentthroughout its post-independence history has beenfor the public sector to provide basic essentialservices, through direct budgetary allocation orforeign donor support. This appears to be the policythrust in the current period as well. Accordingly, thegovernment has launched a multi-focusedprogramme of infrastructure development ashighlighted in the Ten-Year Horizon DevelopmentFramework 2006-2016 and in government\u2019s Randoraprogramme. These programmes have beendesigned in order to develop a regionally balancednetwork of economic infrastructure with investmentschannelled through the Consolidated Fund, privateand foreign direct investments and Public PrivatePartnerships (PPP). While the currently proposedinvestment programme in infrastructure is laudable,the basic issues relating to economic and socialinfrastructure development need to be addressedurgently so as to generate quality as well assustainable economic growth with a proper balancein the macroeconomy. The issue has been the non-adjustment of prices in the transport, petroleum andpower sectors to reflect their rising costs and therebyeliminating the unproductive direct and indirectsubsidies, which has caused a major macroeconomicimbalance in recent years. In this sense, the recentadjustment of petroleum prices could be viewed as amove taken in the right direction. But, it is alsonecessary to eliminate all other unproductive anduntargeted subsidy elements and free budgetaryresources for other productive investments.",

However, the energy sector continued to sufferfrom high oil prices in international markets. Theelectricity sector, which depends heavily on thermalpower generation, suffered from oil price hikes, causingsevere cash flow imbalances to the monopolyproducer, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The delayin the implementation of a cost reflective tariff systemand low cost power generation projects, and theunfavourable power purchase agreements with theIndependent Power Producers (IPP) were the maincauses for the weak financial position of CEB.

    "text": "The sales of electricity, which exclude systemloss out of the total generation, increased by 5.7per cent to 8,276 GWh in 2007. Electricity demandgrowth has decelerated in recent years due largely tothe slow growth in domestic and industrial sectordemand which had to change its consumption patternin line with the upward revision of electricity tariff.Electricity consumption in the general-purposecategory and domestic sector grew by 16.6 per centand 5.7 per cent, respectively, while electricityconsumption in the industrial sector grew marginallyin 2007. The system losses as a percentage of totalgeneration declined further to 15.6 per cent in 2007.However, a system loss at this level is still relativelyhigh and unaffordable for a loss-making venture.Hence, continuous action is needed to reduce this toa level on par with international best experiences.The electricity sector suffered from escalatingoil prices as well as other institutional andstructural weaknesses. CEB continued to dependhighly on thermal power, mainly from the private sector,on unfavourable terms and conditions to meet the risingdemand for electricity. In 2007, about 60 per cent oftotal electricity generation was from thermal power. Inthe meantime, delays in implementing low cost energysources have led to high cost of power generation.The existing financial and institutional issues in thepower generation by CEB remained without beingaddressed. However, several capacity expansionprojects were in progress in 2007. The constructionwork of the 150 MW Upper Kotmale hydropower projectand the first phase of the 300 MW Norochcholai coalpower plant have continued in 2007. These twoprojects will be connected to the national grid by 2011.Another thermal power plant at Kerawalapitiya isexpected to be commissioned its operation during thesecond half of 2008. The government is also planningto construct 4 medium scale hydropower plants,namely, Uma Oya, Ginganga, Broadland andMoragolla. Another coal power plant of 500 MW, inTrincomalee is under consideration.Several changes were introduced to theelectricity tariff in 2007. The Value Added Tax (VAT)of 15 per cent on electricity consumption was removedfrom January 2007. Given the current operating lossesin CEB, these charges appear to bring adverse resultson the budget. In addition to the removal of VAT, theindustrial sector was benefited by the exemption ofthe payment of fuel adjustment charge of 20 per centwith effect from 2007. Though these measures wouldminimise the cost of living of domestic users, their long-term adverse effect on both CEB and the governmentbudget would be significant: CEB would suffer from a",

Theaverage tariff in 2007 was Rs.10.58 per unit, whereasthe average cost was Rs.13.48 per unit. The estimatedaverage purchased cost of private power was Rs. 14.92per unit in 2007. The need for a tariff adjustment hasarisen in the light of high cost of power generation asa result of escalating oil prices. With the already hightariffs prevailing in the country, it is vital that the CEBexpedites the implementation of low cost powerprojects and encourage the development of alternativerenewable energy sources, urgently.CEB\u2019s financial position further deteriorated in2007. CEB\u2019s operating losses have increased to Rs. 15billion, excluding indirect subsidies through lower fuelprices. If the CPC subsidies are internalized, the totaloperating loss would be Rs. 21 billion. CEB\u2019s short-term borrowings from commercial banks, payments inarrears to the CPC and IPP and other short-termliabilities amounted to Rs. 55 billion at end 2007. CEB\u2019slong-term loans amounted to Rs. 89 billion by end2007. The financial position of CEB is therefore fragileand alarming. Since it is a state sector monopoly, itsfuture solvency will largely fall on the taxpayers.However, the storng belief that CEB would beeventually bailed out by the taxpayers has also dialutedthe incentive for CEB to improve and to introduceefficiency measures. If this state of affairs is allowedto continue, willingly or unwillingly, the nation will haveto soon shoulder this burden as well.Urgent action is needed for the conservation ofenergy and the development of renewable energysources to deal with impact of present energycrisis. Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority(SLSEA) was established in 2007 with a view toensuring energy security, increasing indigenous energygeneration and curbing the growth of unnecessaryenergy intensity in the economy.

Theprogramme was streamlined with the help of a newselection procedure named \u201cJanasbaha\u201d. Under thenew selection process only the deserving beneficiarieswere selected for Samurdhi relief with therecommendation of representatives from respectivevillages. Previously about 40 per cent of the populationenjoyed Samurdhi relief though the existing povertylevel is around 15.2 per cent (As per Household Incomeand Expenditure Survey - 2006/07 conducted by theDepartment of Census and Statistics). The newselection process targeting the needy groups hasreduced the number to an estimated 38 per cent ofthe population indicating the need for improving thetargeting. Given the continued high budgetary cost ofthe Samurdhi programme, it is necessary to link thepoor to the properly designed safety ropesprogrammes to enable them to exit poverty and therebybecome responsible citizens in the mainstream socio-economic political life. It is time now to re-visit theSamurdhi programme with improving it on the basis ofthe ultimate goal of eradicating poverty.",

Due to the natureof their activities, some may find it much easier to loweremissions by even more than the legally binding level, at arelatively lower cost. Those who cannot reduce theiremissions more cheaply could purchase carbon credits fromthose who implement carbon reducing projects indeveloping countries, at a cost which is less than what theywould have had to spend in order to comply with theiremissions targets. This would entail a win-win solution toan environmental problem as the overall emissions are cut,whilst total cost would be reduced.

By implementing pollution controltechnology, Sri Lanka\u2019s industries could reduce CO2emissions further. As such, carbon trading could turn outto be a new income source for the country. Budget 2008has indicated that Sri Lanka could reduce around 3 milliontons of CO2 emissions per year, which could be a valuablesource of foreign exchange earnings for the country. Powergeneration (hydro, wind, solar), biomass, energyconservation, transportation, municipal solid waste disposaland forestry are the major areas that have been identifiedas potential areas that could benefit from CDM in Sri Lanka.",
