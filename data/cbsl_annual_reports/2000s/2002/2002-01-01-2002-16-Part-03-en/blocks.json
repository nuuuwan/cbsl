Weak corporate governance (and associated risk management practices) in the corporate sector increases the risk profile of companies and exposes banks and other lending institutions to greater risk of loss than would otherwise be the case. In a more direct sense, weaknesses in corporate governance in banks and other financial institutions reduce their capacity to identify, monitor and manage their business risks, and can result in poor quality lending and excessive risk-taking by such institutions. For example, inadequate corporate governance can lead to poor management of credit risks, an insufficiently developed \"credit culture\", excessive exposure concentration, poor management of interest rate risk and exchange rate risk, and inadequacies in the management of connected exposures. In some cases, inadequacies in corporate governance and risk management have the potential to lead to bank insolvency and financial instability.",
