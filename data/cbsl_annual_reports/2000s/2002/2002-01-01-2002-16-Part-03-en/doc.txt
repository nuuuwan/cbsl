CODE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOR BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

Introduction

Corporate Governance

Corporate governance is "a set of relationships between a company's management, its Board, its shareholders, and other stakeholders through enhanced performance (OECD).

Corporate Governance is an essential safeguard of a stable banking system. As Asia emerges from the economic crisis, most institutions in the region want to introduce good corporate governance." (The Corporate Governance of Banks, Arvind Mathur and Jimmy Burhan, ADB)

Corporate governance also provides the structure through which the objectives of the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance are determined. Good corporate governance should provide proper incentives for the Board and management to pursue objectives that are in the interests of the company and shareholders and should facilitate effective monitoring, thereby encouraging companies to use resources more efficiently.

Inadequacy of Corporate Governance and Financial Instability

Good corporate governance of banks/financial institutions is a sine qua non for a sound financial system. For individual banks/financial institutions, it can reduce the cost of capital and enhance shareholder value. The Asian financial crisis has, in part, been attributed to serious inadequacies in the governance of banks. The post crisis period has created an environment where most of the major financial institutions in Asia are now willing to implement governance reforms, not only as a way to ensure survival, but also as a competitive weapon.

Inadequate Corporate Governance in the corporate and financial sectors is an important factor that has contributed to financial instability in many countries. Weak corporate governance (and associated risk management practices) in the corporate sector increases the risk profile of companies and exposes banks and other lending institutions to greater risk of loss than would otherwise be the case. In a more direct sense, weaknesses in corporate governance in banks and other financial institutions reduce their capacity to identify, monitor and manage their business risks, and can result in poor quality lending and excessive risk-taking by such institutions. For example, inadequate corporate governance can lead to poor management of credit risks, an insufficiently developed "credit culture", excessive exposure concentration, poor management of interest rate risk and exchange rate risk, and inadequacies in the management of connected exposures. In some cases, inadequacies in corporate governance and risk management have the potential to lead to bank insolvency and financial instability.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2002 ( iii )

Part III Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2002

Underlying Principles of Corporate Governance in Banking and other Financial Institutions

More than most other corporate entities, banks and financial institutions are critically reliant on maintaining the confidence of depositors and other creditors for their viability. The financial viability, and indeed survival, of a financial institution are very much dependent on maintaining depositor and other counter-party confidence. Therefore, the directors and senior management of such institutions could be said to have a special duty of care to their depositors and other creditors - the creditors are extremely important stakeholders in a financial institution. A financial institution's corporate governance arrangements could be expected to reflect this duty of care to creditors in a number of ways, such as in the management of conflicts of interest between shareholders and creditors, in the nature of financial disclosures made to creditors (and others) and in the nature of risk management systems.

Risk Management and Corporate Governance

Financial institutions differ from most companies in terms of the nature and range of their business risks, and the adverse consequences that would follow if these risks are poorly managed. Banks/financial institutions face a wide range of risks, many of them complicated in nature, including credit risk, exposure concentration risk, connected exposure risk, interest rate risk, exchange rate risk, payment system interface risks and business continuity risks. If these risks are poorly identified and managed, they expose such institutions to the potential for financial collapse, particularly given the fact that most financial institutions operate on a thin layer of capitalization and have substantial maturity mismatches in their balance sheet. Therefore, they need corporate governance structures that promote effective identification, monitoring and management of all material business risks.

Regulatory Requirements and Corporate Governance

Most financial institutions are required to comply with a large number of regulatory requirements, including prudential requirements, taxation rules, various reporting obligations and the like. There is, therefore, a need for the corporate governance framework to include systems for ensuring that all statutory and regulatory requirements are being complied with and to highlight potential or actual breaches if and when they occur.

High Quality Financial Disclosure

An essential complement to sound corporate governance is the implementation of robust financial disclosure requirements for corporates and financial institutions. Financial disclosure is essential as a means of strengthening the accountability of directors and senior management and enhancing the incentives for risk management. It is also essential for market participants and observers - particularly the larger creditors of banks, financial news media, financial analysts and rating agencies - to effectively monitor the performance and soundness of financial institutions and to exercise appropriate disciplines on those institutions which do not perform well or fail to meet acceptable prudential standards. Financial disclosure is also essential for smaller creditors, including depositors, to protect their own interests.

Strengthening Market Discipline

It is increasingly being recognized that market discipline can play an important role in promoting financial system stability and in encouraging the maintenance of sound corporate governance and risk management practices. Banks and corporates are more likely to be attentive to risk management in an environment where poor risk management and financial performance are penalized by the market, and strong risk management, and financial performance are rewarded by the market. In the longer term, robust market discipline is likely to enhance financial stability and efficiency by strengthening the incentives for the efficient management of risks and by weeding out poor performers.

2. Content of Corporate Governance

Objectives

From a banking and financial sector industry perspective, corporate governance involves the manner in which the business and affairs of individual institutions are governed by their Boards of directors and senior management. These include the following :

• set corporate objectives (including generating economic returns to owners);

• set risk management policies and procedures;

• ensure that the day-to-day operations of the business are carried out efficiently and with integrity;

• protect the interests of depositors;

• consider the interests of recognized stakeholders;

• align corporate activities and behaviour with the expectation that the institutions will operate in a safe and sound manner; and

• operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Strategies and Techniques

Strategies and techniques that are basic to sound corporate governance include:

• corporate values, code of conduct and other standards of appropriate behaviour and the systems used to ensure compliance with them;

• a well-articulated corporate strategy against which the success of the overall enterprise and the contribution of individuals can be measured;

• clear assignment of responsibilities and decision-making authorities, incorporating a hierarchy of required approvals from individuals to the Board of directors;

• establishment of a mechanism for the interaction and cooperation among the Board of directors, senior management and the auditors;

• strong internal control systems, including internal and external audit functions, risk management functions, independence in business operations, and other checks and balances;

• special monitoring of risk exposures where conflicts of interest are likely to be particularly great, including business relationships with borrowers affiliated with the bank, large shareholders, senior management, or key decision-makers within the firm (e.g. traders);

• financial and managerial incentives to act in an appropriate manner offered to senior management, business line management and employees in the form of compensation, promotion and other recognition; and

• appropriate information flows internally and to the public.

• Communication throughout the organization and also to the stakeholders of the organization as to what the Institution is going to achieve in the years ahead and the corporate values.

Principle - 1 0

Transparency

An essential factor in promoting effective corporate governance in the financial sector is to develop and enforce robust financial disclosure requirements for financial institutions.

Financial disclosures should be subject to rigorous external auditing requirements, based on a set of auditing guidelines promulgated by an appropriately qualified standard-setting body.

Guideline -10.4

Disclosures of financial information are more useful if they are made with a reasonable degree of frequency - e.g half yearly or quarterly.

• the nature of any conflicts of interest that individual directors or senior managers may have ;

• the Board's rules for handling directors' and managers' conflicts of interests; and

• attestations signed by each director as to whether they are satisfied that the risks of the financial institution are being adequately identified, monitored and controlled at all times.

Guideline -10.8

There shall be an officer identified by name and designation charged with monitoring of compliance with disclosure requirements and equipped with the powers to enforce compliance where appropriate. The authority should be subject to effective transparency and accountability structures.

Appendix to Principle 10

Roles and Responsibilities of External Auditor

Although external auditors are not, by definition, part of a banking organization and therefore, are not part of its internal control system, they have an important impact on the quality of internal controls through their audit activities, including discussions with management and recommendations for improvement to internal controls. The external auditors provide important feedback on the effectiveness of the internal control system.

While the primary purpose of the external audit function is to give an opinion on, or to certify, the annual accounts of a financial institution, the external auditor must choose whether to rely on the effectiveness of the institution's internal control system.

The external auditors have to conduct an evaluation of the internal control system in order to assess the extent to which they can rely on the system in determining the nature, timing and scope of their own audit procedures.

Auditing standards require that audits be planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance that financial statements are free of material misstatement. Auditors should examine, on a test basis, underlying transactions and records supporting financial statement balances and disclosures. An auditor assesses the

(xiv) Centra! Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2002

Part III Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2002

accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluate the overall financial statement presentation.

The Central Bank may supplement the standard auditing requirements with additional requirements for

unique application to banks. Modifications can sometimes include:

• a requirement for the auditor to report to, or meet with, the supervisory authority; and

• a requirement obliging the auditor to report any concerns they may have to the supervisory authority.

• a requirement to inform supervisory authority of any proposed changes of auditors or their resignations.

Principle - 1 1

Risk Management Systems

Financial institutions need corporate governance structures that promote effective identification, monitoring and management of all material business risks. These structures may include well developed and tested risk management systems and internal controls including the following;

Guideline -11.1

Training programmes for staff responsible for risk management, so that they have a well developed understanding of risks and the means by which they can be managed.

Guideline -11.2

Training programmes for directors and senior management to enable them to have a robust understanding of the nature of the institution's business, the nature of the risks, the consequences of risks being inadequately managed, and an appreciation of the techniques for managing the risks effectively.

Guideline -11.3

Robust internal audit procedures, with appropriate reporting lines to the CEO or directors, and with oversight by the Audit Committee of the Board.

Guideline -11.4

A structure which requires regular reporting to senior management and the Board on the nature and magnitude of the risks being carried by the bank and the structures in place to control these risks, including a regular assurance to the Board that all risk management systems and internal controls are being properly applied at all times.

Guideline -11.5

Signed attestations by each director, in a public disclosure statement issued by the bank, that the director is fully satisfied to the best of his or her ability that all the bank's material business risks are being effectively identified, monitored and managed, and that the systems in place to achieve this are operating effectively at all times.

Guideline -11.6

A policy requiring the institution's risk management systems and internal controls to be subject to periodic external review, and for the results of the review to be reported to the Board.

Guideline -11.7

Institutions to view compliance functions as a part of the overall risk management framework and submission of compliance certificate to the Board on a monthly basis.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2002 ( x v )

Part III Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2002

Guideline -11.8

Institutions need to comply with a large number of regulatory requirements, including prudential requirements, taxation rules, various reporting obligations and the like. There is therefore a need for the corporate governance framework to include systems for ensuring that all statutory and regulatory requirements are being complied with, and to highlight potential or actual breaches if and when they occur.

Guideline -11.9

Institutions need to consider the scope to use their influence and moral suasion to promote good governance among their own corporate customers, thereby improving their performance and reducing their risk, which would ultimately benefit the institutions themselves, and the wider economy.

Guideline -11.10

Duties need to be segregated so as to avoid operational risks. Board may specify the methods of authorisation, limits and delegation and a dual control system to ensure accuracy of limit risks.

Principle - 12

Prudential Regulation and Supervision - For Regulators

Prudential supervision plays an important role in encouraging the adoption of sound corporate governance and risk management arrangements in the financial sector. In assessing the adequacy of supervision arrangements in the context of promoting effective corporate governance in the financial system, the following considerations are relevant:

Guideline -12.1 '

Directors and senior management should be encouraged to take responsibility for satisfying themselves that their institution has effective corporate governance arrangements and systems for managing all material business risks and that those systems are being applied at all times. One way of encouraging this is for the supervisory authority to require institution directors and senior management to sign regular statements attesting to the effectiveness of risk management systems, internal controls, internal audit arrangements and related matters, and to hold them responsible if it transpires that those attestations were misleading or false.

Guideline -12.2

Encourage or require institutions to have their corporate governance arrangements and risk management systems subject to periodic external review by external auditors or consultants.

The periodic external review by external auditors or consultants should be done after a critical cost/benefit evaluation as far as possible in measurable forms (i.e. quantitative) to ensure positive results in the short/ medium/long term.

Guideline -12.3

Institutions are encouraged to make it a condition that effective corporate governance is enforced by the borrowing institutions when large sums are lent to such institutions.

Guideline -12.4

Require institutions to maintain and publicly disclose a credit rating from a reputable international credit rating agency, so as to provide an additional degree of external scrutiny of each bank's corporate governance and risk management capacity.

(xvi) Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2002

Part III Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2002

Guideline -12.5

Provide guidelines on corporate governance arrangements and risk management systems and use the guidelines as a framework for periodic assessments of the adequacy of corporate governance arrangements.

Guideline -12.6

Hold periodic consultations with bank directors to discuss banking risk issues and other matters relating to the governance of their bank.

Guideline - 12.7

Require banks to have a corporate governance compliance officer, and require regular reports from the compliance officer, attesting to the adequacy of particular corporate governance arrangements.

Management information regularly provided to the Board.

• Methodologies used by the Board to assess the adequacy of the bank's corporate governance and risk management frameworks, and the methods used to assess whether these frameworks are being applied satisfactorily at all times.

• Nature of internal and external audit arrangements, including the composition and role of the Audit Committee.

• The Reports of the Audit Committee and other committees are submitted regularly and action taken.

• Bank's policies for managing potential conflicts of interest between the bank and its shareholders or other parties.

• Nature of shareholder scrutiny of the bank.

• Policies for dealing with potential conflicts of interest on the part of bank directors.

• Nature of the resources made available to the Board to assist it to discharge its responsibilities.

• Nature of the reporting from the Board to shareholders and the transparency of how the Board conducts its affairs.

• Supervisory authorities should be involved in tax reforms to ensure that bank customers provide honest information of their revenues and sources.

Operating Instructions to Authorised Dealers

Dear Sirs,

CREDITING OF FREIGHT CHARGES TO RUPEE ACCOUNTS MAINTAINED ON BEHALF OF SHIPPING LINES BY SHIPPING AGENTS

We wish to draw your attention to the last two paragraphs of item C of our Guidelines to Authorised Dealers on Removal of Exchange Control Restrictions on Current Account (Non-Capital) Transactions No.EC/D/GL/1994/2 of 18th March 1994, issued along with operating Instructions No.EC/06/94 dated 18th March 1994, whereby you have been permitted to credit only freight and passage collections to the rupee accounts maintained on behalf of shipping lines by Shipping Agents.

2. It has been brought to my notice that in addition to freight collections, charges levied as Terminal Handling Charges (THCs) by Shipping Agents on behalf of shipping lines for meeting certain land based costs, which are not a component of freight, are also being credited to these rupee accounts.

3. THCs which are meant to meet local expenses do not qualify in terms of the above mentioned Operating Instructions for credit to the accounts maintained in the name of shipping lines for the purpose of making outward remittances. Therefore, you are informed that you should not credit THCs to such accounts. Having regard to the fact that immediate termination of the practice of crediting THC to accounts maintained by shipping lines could cause difficulty to shipping agents and shipping lines, these instructions would come into effect from 4th March 2002, so that shipping agents would have adequate time to make suitable alternate arrangements.

Yours faithfully,

Controller of Exchange

SHIPPING/AIR LINES

The attention of all authorised dealers are drawn to our guidelines No. EC/D/GL/1994/2 of 18th March 1994 in terms of which authorised dealers were permitted to open and maintain rupee accounts in respect of foreign shipping/air lines on behalf of their principals for crediting their freight and passage collections and for making outward remittances from such accounts, after meeting all their liabilities in Sri Lanka including tax payable to the government.

2. Authorised dealers are hereby informed that BOI Companies approved under Section 17 of the BOI Act with full exemption from the Exchange Control Act (Section 17 approved BOI companies) and Exporters who have foreign currency account facilities are hereby permitted to pay freight to foreign Shipping/Airlines in foreign currency by debiting their foreign currency accounts with banks in Sri Lanka. Therefore, in addition to the above rupee account, a foreign currency account could also be maintained in the domestic unit of an authorised dealer (commercial bank) by a shipping/airline agent on behalf of its foreign principal only for the purpose of collecting freight paid by Section 17 approved BOI Companies and exporters, in foreign currency, subject to the following terms and conditions:

i. The foreign currency account should be maintained only with same authorised dealer with whom the rupee account referred to in paragraph 1 is maintained.

ii. All credits of freight payments to such foreign account should be by a bank draft or cheque drawn on a foreign currency account held by the Section 17 approved BOI Company or the Exporter with a bank in Sri Lanka.

i i i . In addition to freight, any inward remittances received in foreign currency from the foreign shipping/airline to meet its local expenses could also be credited to the foreign currency account.

iv. Any outward remittances from the foreign currency account should be made only after ensuring that the foreign shipping/ airline has adequate funds either in its foreign currency account or its rupee account to meet all its liabilities in Sri Lanka including tax payable to the Government. A confirmation from the shipping/airline agent to this effect should be obtained by the Bank before making outward remittances to the foreign Shipping/Airline.

3. Authorised dealers should continue to credit freight paid in rupees to the rupee account maintained on behalf of the foreign shipping/airline.

4. Please contact me if any clarification on this are required.

Yours faithfully,

Operating Instructions To Authorised Dealers

Dear Sirs,

S H A R E I N V E S T M E N T E X T E R N A L R U P E E A C C O U N T S

(A) Investment in Shares

The Government has decided to relax existing restrictions on foreign investments as announced in the Budget 2002 by permitting non residents to invest upto 100% in the equity capital of companies incorporated in Sri Lanka without Exchange Control restrictions, in the areas of banking, finance, insurance, stock broking, construction of residential buildings and roads, water supply, mass transportation, telecommunication, power and energy, professional services and setting up of branch/liaison offices of companies which have been incorporated overseas, subject only to the rules of the relevant regulatory authorities.

2. In order to give effect to this decision, a general permission has been granted by me in a notice published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1232/14 of 19.04.2002 by rescinding earlier notices published in the Gazettes Extraordinary Nos. 721/4 of 29.06.1992 and 1122/12 of 07.03.2000 in respect of the issue and transfer of shares to and from non residents.

3. Accordingly, Authorised Dealers are hereby permitted to open and operate "Share Investment External Rupee Accounts" (SIERA), including existing accounts, in the names of -

(a) Country Funds and Regional Funds approved by the Ministry of Finance

(b) Companies incorporated outside Sri Lanka; and

(c) Citizens of foreign states (whether resident in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka) and Sri Lankans resident outside Sri Lanka as defined by the direction given by the Hon. Minister of Finance in Gazette No. 15007 of 21.04.1972.

(d) Unconverted foreign currency remaining in the FCBU Account thereafter due to rejection of applications or partial acceptance of applications may be refunded to them.

(B) Investments in Units of Unit Trusts

The above scheme of SIERAs is also made applicable for investments by non residents in Units of Unit Trusts as permitted by me in the notice published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1122/12 of 07.03.2000 which continues to be in force.

Operating Instructions To All Authorised Dealers

Dear Sir,

HOUSING LOANS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TO SRI LANKANS EMPLOYED ABROAD

As a further measure to liberalise Exchange Controls, it has been decided to permit Authorised Dealers to grant loans in foreign currency to Sri Lankans employed abroad, who are in a position to service such loans in foreign currency, for construction or purchase of residential houses in Sri Lanka, subject to the following terms and conditions:

1. An assessment of credit risk of the loan in foreign currency should be made before it is granted, particularly on the borrower's ability to repay the loan in foreign currency having regard to his/her employment abroad and/or existing balances in his/her foreign currency account.

2. The foreign currency proceeds of the loan will be released in Sri Lanka Rupees to the borrower by the bank, which grants, the loan, purchasing the foreign exchange.

3. The loans should be disbursed in accordance with procedures usually followed by banks when releasing loans for the purpose of purchasing or constructing houses. In the case of a loan for construction, it should be released on instalment basis, depending upon the progress of construction, as is usually done by banks.

4. Any foreign exchange risk likely to arise in the event of a default of repayment of the loan in foreign currency should be hedged by building up of a prudential reserve in foreign currency in the bank.

5. Adequate security should be obtained either in the form of a mortgage of a property or in the form of a lien on foreign currency deposits etc. to cover the credit risk.

6. Authorised dealers are requested to report the details of such loans granted on a quarterly basis including the amount of prudential reserves built up for the hedging the currency risk, within 15 days of the end of each quarter.

Yours faithfully,

Controller of Exchange

DIRECTION ON SEGREGATION OF PROPRIETARY GOVERNMENT

SECURITIES ACCOUNTS

This direction is issued under Section 10(2) of the Regulations made by the President, dated 1 March, 2000 under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance and the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance and will come into effect from 1 January, 2002.

K.G.D.D. Dheerasinghe

Superintendent of Public Debt

Colombo

10 January, 2002

1. With effect from 1st January 2002, Primary Dealers are required to classify their proprietary government

securities portfolio under two categories: Investment Account and Trading Account.

2. The criteria for classifying government securities into such categories are given below:

Trading Account

(a) Government securities acquired for the specific purpose of trading on a regular basis to profit from short-term changes in market prices and yields shall be held in the Trading Account. (b) Government securities held in the Trading Account must be revalued or "Marked to Market" on a weekly basis using the weekly report on Weighted Average Market Prices compiled by the Central Bank.

(c) Any gains or losses on securities held in the Trading Account must be taken to earnings.

Investment Account

(a) Government securities acquired with the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity shall be held in the Investment Account. The Primary Dealer should intend to earn a regular interest yield from these securities. Securities classified into the Investment Account shall be documented and authorized by the Chief Executive Officer of the Primary Dealer and this statement must be submitted to the Public Debt Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka with the monthly financial statements. (b) Securities in the Investment Account may be used for repurchase transactions. (c) Securities in the Investment Account shall be carried and reported at cost over the period of redemption, with the following exceptions;

(i) Carrying values of securities in the Investment Account may be adjusted to account for the accretion of discount (or depletion of premium). The adjustments should be amortised on a straight-line basis over the period to maturity. (ii) Carrying values of securities in the Investment Account may be written down to their fair value to account for any diminution in value which is expected to be other than temporary (i.e. if the decline results in a permanent impairment of the value of the security).

(iii) The carrying value of securities in the Investment Account used under temporary switching transactions in repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, may be adjusted after the reversal or "second leg" of the transaction has been concluded to reflect margin calls.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2002 (liii)

Part III Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2002

(iv) The carrying value of securities transferred from the Trading Account into the Investment Account shall be marked to market prior to the transfer. Therefore, any gains or losses due to revaluation would have been recognised in earnings prior to the transfer. The market value of the securities at the point of transfer into the Investment Account then becomes the 'historical cost' for accounting purposes.

Reclassification of Securities

(a) Transfer of securities between the Trading Account and the Investment Account must be justifiable, documented and authorized. A statement on portfolio transfers, if any, shall be signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Primary Dealer and submitted to the Public Debt Department together with the monthly financial statements.

(b) Portfolio transfers shall only be undertaken rarely. The circumstances justifying portfolio transfers into and out of the Investment Account are given below:

(0 A change in the statutory and regulatory requirements regarding the type or level of permissible investment securities

(ii) A significant increase in the capital requirements that obliges the Primary Dealer to reduce its investment holdings

(iii) A major business occurrence that necessitates the sale of securities to maintain the Primary Dealer's risk profile

(iv) A significant change in risk weights assigned to government securities for the purpose of computing the capital adequacy ratio.

The guidelines on market revaluation and the accounting treatment of the securities accounts are given

Market Revaluation of Proprietary Securities Accounts

below.

Table 1

Market Revaluation of Proprietary Securities Accounts

Description Accounting Treatment

i. Investment Account Book and maintain at cost

Amortise premium or discount over period to redemption

Adjust for impairment of value expected to be other than temporary

Profit (loss) from sale prior to maturity is charged to capital

Gains (losses) on Investment Securities are taken to income

ii. Trading Account Mark to Market at least weekly using CBSL market rates

Profit (loss) from sale prior to maturity is charged to capital

Gains (losses) on Investment Securities are taken to income

iii. Securities used in financing transactions (repurchase and reverse repurchase)

Retain securities on the balance sheet

The value of securities outstanding (i.e. where the reversal of the repurchase and/or reverse repurchase transaction has not been effected) should be adjusted for margin calls

(liv) Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2002

Part III Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2002

iv. Reclassification of securities from Trading to Investment Account

v. Reclassification of securities from Investment to Trading Account

Book interest income/expense, whether explicit or implicit, to the B/S; Interest Income or Interest Expense account

Book the reclassified security at current market rate

That current market rate becomes the 'historical cost' of the

security

Take profit (loss) from reclassification to income as the transfer 'in substance' (i.e. the intention) amounts to a sale.

Definition and Structure

A repurchase (repo) is a sale and repurchase agreement. For example, Party A sells securities to Party B with a legally binding agreement to purchase equivalent securities from Party B for an agreed price at a specified future date, or at call. Legal ownership to the securities changes giving Party B full ("unfettered") title to the securities. Party B may use or dispose of them as it pleases, but it has an obligation to deliver equivalent securities to Party A at the end of the repo. Party A's spot sale and forward purchase (repo) is matched by Party B's spot purchase and forward sale ("reverse repo").

The interest rate implied by the difference between the sale price and "repurchase" price is the repo rate. If Party A is selling securities to Party B in order to raise finance for itself, then the repo rate is, in effect, the cost to Party A of raising secured funds. Party B can "lend" money to Party A for a "repo rate" of interest, and receive government securities. This is a "general collateral, or GC repo" (see Annex 1) and is normally initiated by the party which wants to borrow money i.e. the cash taker.

Alternatively, Party B may have a short position in a particular government security, which it covers by obtaining (reversing in, thus "reverse repo") that security from Party A. As Party B is initiating the transaction, A has more negotiating power over the repo rate he will pay on the cash received. The repo rate may therefore be lower (and may even be zero). This allows party A to invest the cash which it receives -perhaps via GC repo - at a higher rate than he is paying B, and earn a net return. This is a "special" repo", i.e. a repo in a specific government security (see Annex 2) and is normally initiated by the cash provider.

Since the secondary market value of securities provided as "collateral" can vary, the cash taker in GC repo may give a margin to protect the cash provider against adverse movements in the market price of the collateral. For instance, if the expected price volatility of the securities used was V% over the period from initial payment of the margin to its next normal revaluation, then a repo loan of 100 would require "collateral" of 100 plus V%'. The securities should be revalued every day or at least every week .

Accrued Interest and Pricing of the Securities

The market value of a security will be affected by accrued interest. In the case of coupon bonds - other things being equal - the market value including accrued interest (the "dirty" price3) will increase steadily in between coupon payment dates, and drop by the amount of the coupon on coupon date. In the case of a zero coupon bond, the market value will tend to rise steadily, other things being equal, up to redemption. Similarly, the exposure of a cash lender in a repo transaction will increase over time as interest accrues on the loan.

In the case of most short-term repo transactions, this means that the secondary market value of the collateral increases broadly in line with the value of the loan plus accrued interest. With longer-term

(lxxxii) Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2002

Part III Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2002

transactions, particularly if the yield curve is significantly sloped (whether positively or negatively) the collateral: loan ratio can change over time. This may require a periodic adjustment in the amount of collateral provided4.

If a coupon is payable during the life of a repo, there may be a need for a simultaneous adjustment to the level of collateral, as there will be a step adjustment to the market value of the collateral without a corresponding change to the value of the loan plus accrued interest. In practice, most short-term repo transactions will try to use securities where the coupon payment dates fall outside the period of the repo transaction.

Hold-in-custodv (HIC) Repo

In some cases, the cash taker may retain the security - in a segregated account - rather than transferring it. For instance, a large bank might borrow cash by repo, but in order to reduce transactions costs and facilitate substitution (see annex 1), the repo is not registered with the (central bank's) government securities registry/depository. While the cash provider is the beneficial owner of the securities, it is still registered in the name of the cash taker. The cash provider takes on some credit risk in order to obtain a higher overall return.

Tri-partite Repo

One of the parties I the repo may not have an account in the (dematerialised) settlement system, or may lack the necessary back-office infrastructure to manage the administration of repo. If the cash provider does not wish to assume credit risk on the cash taker by using HIC repo, he could ask a third party - perhaps a custodian bank with good credit rating, or an international clearing organisation - to stand in the middle, effectively acting as an agency broker.

Blocked Repo

Where repo is essentially being used as a form of secured lending, the securities taken as "collateral" may be put into a blocked account. Although the form of repo means that legal ownership passes to the "cash provider", they cannot be on-sold or otherwise pledged unless there is an event of default. In this" case it is necessary to clarify who has the power to un-block the securities, and in what circumstances. In the event of default, it is important that the cash provider can access the securities quickly (to minimize price risk).

Blocked repo reduces the liquidity of the transaction for the cash provider, as it is not possible in this case to on-sell or repo out the securities received. This will tend to discourage the use of longer-term contracts and may prove a major deterrent to the use of repo. In some countries blocked repo is preferred by the authorities, at least in the initial stages of the market, because if prevents a chain of transactions involving a single security, and where a default could precipitate a chain reaction. (If Bank A does not return securities to Bank B, then Bank B cannot in turn pass them back to Bank C, and so on.)

Blocked repo also prevents the cash provider from taking a short position by selling outright a security which has been repoed in. However, it is not clear that this reduces risk in the market, since any position, whether long or short, entails a measure of risk.

FOOTNOTES

1. Strictly speaking, the collateral would be 100/(1 - V%); but for low values of V the difference is insignificant.

2 The repo interest is calculated as size of the "loan"*interest rate (here 0.065 as the rate is 6.5%)* period of the repo (e.g. 7/365 for a 7 day repo). 100* 0.065*(7/365) = 0.125

3. It is normal market practice to quote securities prices excluding accrued interest ("clean" prices), as this facilitates comparison between different securities and across time; but accrued interest is of course taken into account when calculating the actual payment for any transaction.

4. Account must also be taken of ex-dividend dates (if these apply) when valuing the collateral.

Annex 3

Classic repo vs Sell and Buy-Back

A sell and buy-back is in many respects similar to repo, though more "primitive". The key similarities and differences, are summarised below :

• Purchase and Sale : Both involve purchase and sale, i.e transfer of ownership, rather than the use of the security as collateral (where ownership is only transferred in the event of default).

• Margin maintenance : Sale and buy-back typically does not involve margin maintenance. While this simplifies the transaction, because there is no need to provide additional margin if the secondary market price of the security changes, it can give rise to increased credit risk - see annex 6.

• Coupon : With repo, the cash taker retains the right to any coupon payments. If coupon is paid during the life of the repo (to the cash provider as legal owner), it must be immediately passed to the cash taker. Failure to do so would constitute an event of default. In a sell and buy-back, the value of the coupon is factored in to the repurchase price. This gives rise to credit exposure against the cash provider for the period between payment of the coupon and maturity of the repo.

• Substitution : In a repo transaction, the security repoed can in principle be substituted for another security of the same value. Assume for instance that a market-maker repos out a security, and then has demand from a client to buy that particular security. The market-maker could conclude the deal with the client, and substitute a different security for the one repoed. The client obtains the specific security he wants, and the repo cash provider still has satisfactory "collateral", (in practice, the cash provider may charge a few basis points for the inclusion of the substitution clause, since this gives the cash taker rather than the cash provider the chance to benefit if the security goes "special".) There is no right of substitution in sell and buy-back transactions.

• Industry-approved contract : This exists for repo, normally the PSA/ISMA contract, providing greater legal certainty to both participants. There is no standard documentation with sell and buy-back transactions.
