This programme will therefore trigger off further financial sector reforms by creating an efficient central bank in the centre that contributes to the ultimate objective of establishing a competitive and prudently managed banking system.",

Accordingly, the Bank offered a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to certain categories of employees. The scheme offered an adequate compensation/retirement package and it encouraged many employees to opt for the VRS. Accordingly, with effect from the beginning of 2002,690 employees retired from the Bank's service.

The Secretary to the Ministry of Finance by his letter dated 16 December 2002 has expressed no objection to such proposal. Accordingly, the holdings of the investments in the share capital of the RDBs have been reduced to 20 per cent by transferring the shares held above 20 per cent, in the name of the General Treasury for a consideration of Rs.352 million.",

PSDB, a small bank, was licensed in 1997 as a specialised bank and engaged in banking activities other than maintaining demand deposits, foreign exchange dealings and off-shore banking. On the basis of a report submitted by the Director of Bank Supervision (DBS) based on information gathered through off-site surveillance and on-site examination which revealed that the bank was financially in a parlous condition with a non-performing assets ratio of over 75 per cent, the Monetary Board made an Order in terms of Section 76M of the Banking Act to suspend the business of PSDB with effect from 25 October 2002. The suspension was made with the objective of conserving the remaining assets of the bank in the interest of the depositors and creditors. After suspension, the BSD commenced a comprehensive examination of the affairs of PSDB in terms of Section 76L of the Banking Act in order to ascertain its true financial condition'. Since the previous examination had shown mismanagement in the bank, the services of an audit firm, Messrs. Ernst & Young, were also obtained to carry out a special audit of the bank.",

An opportunity was given to the Chairman and the Board of Directors of PSDB to respond to these findings. The Directors responded both in writing and verbally at a meeting of the Monetary Board held on 13 December 2002. While they did not object to the findings and observations of the Central Bank, they made a proposal to resume the business of PSDB which involved making available to PSDB a sum of Rs.600 million. They, however, did not demonstrate any commitment on their part or on the part of the shareholders of PSDB to contribute any funds to revive PSDB. In the Central Bank's estimation and in the estimation of auditors appointed by the Central Bank, a much larger sum than Rs.600 million was required to revive the bank. In the absence of a commitment by the Directors and the shareholders to bring in additional funds to PSDB, any contribution to PSDB will have to be out of tax payers funds. Therefore, the Monetary Board had no option but to cause the DBS to take action to wind up PSDB and to cancel the licence issued to it. In the winding up the liquidator will distribute the available assets of PSDB among depositors and creditors according to law.",

This distortion was caused by the tendency in the yield rates in the primary market to decline by more than the Bank's margin following the improvement in liquidity. The increase in the margin would encourage dealers to bid competitively in the primary market instead of purchasing Treasury bills at the secondary window of the Bank. The Bank's discounting yield rates on 91 days, 182 days and 364 days Treasury bills gradually decreased from 12.93 per cent, 13.21 per cent and 13.69 per cent per annum respectively, at the beginning of 2001 to 8.67 per cent, 8.64 per cent and 8.66 per cent per annum respectively, at the end of the year.",

This mechanism has substantially increased the efficiency in the refund process, since the member is able to verify the information in his refund application for compatibility with particulars in the database of the EPF at the time of submitting the application.

Although the Fund credits the annual interest on these CNMA also, and refunds them at the member's retirement, the accumulation of CNMA hampers administrative efficiencies.

Other policy measures implemented during the course of 2002 were extending the facility of maintaining interest bearing accounts to foreign passport holders with resident visas, permitting exporters to pay freight in foreign currency, permitting migrant workers to obtain housing loans in foreign currency, the enhancing of the limit for travellers to take out of the country Sri Lankan rupees, and permitting persons to retain in their possession a limited amount of unutilised foreign currency purchased for previous travel by residents, for use in future travel. In addition, recommendations made by the Financial Sector Reform Committee (FSRC) to remove impediments that existed on payment terms on current international transactions that had already been liberalised and to further liberalise capital account transactions have been announced in November 2002 as Budget Proposals for 2003. Action was initiated to give effect to these proposals in early 2003.",

With effect from April 2000, this permission was extended to cover non resident controlled companies approved under Section 17 of the BOI Act as well.

The prudential limits applicable to DFCC Bank and NDB were initially at 5 per cent and later enhanced upto 10 per cent with effect from 10 April 2001.

The forward premium in the domestic market declined significantly due to market expectations of a weaker US dollar. With heavy selling pressure and importers' reluctance to book foreign exchange forward, the forward premia dropped below the interest rate differential between the US dollar and the rupee. The volume of transactions increased significantly during the second half of 2002 from US dollars 42 million at end 2001 to US dollars 173 million at end of 2002.",

The PDD used a well-planned borrowing programme, and an appropriate mix of short and long-term borrowing in 2002 to lower the cost of borrowing significantly. This effort was facilitated by several macroeconomic factors. Monetary policy was relaxed by lowering the Repo rate gradually. Favourable economic conditions that prevailed since the second half of 2002 have led to market expectations of future lower inflation and interest rates.",

Legal provisions for issuing government securities in scripless form have been made by amendments made to the LTBO and the RSSO.

The sub sectors covered by the scheme include paddy, tea, rubber and coconut cultivation, and also small-scale construction. Data collection is accomplished through an island-wide network of school teachers who function as statistical investigators in around 100 centres. Information thus collected is published regularly through the print and electronic media. Seminars were conducted in Colombo, Matara, Anuradhapura and Kandy in 2002, to provide further training for the data collectors in order to improve the quality, efficiency and timeliness of their data collection, as well as to obtain their input on the reasons for differences in price developments across regions identified in the computation of regional consumer price indices.",

Hence, from the first quarter press release in 2002, the coverage was expanded to eleven sectors, the structure used for the annual estimates in the CBSL Annual Report. In addition, the Department also issued an advance release calendar for 2002, indicating the future dates of dissemination of quarterly national income estimates following the practice of many national statistical institutions worldwide that compile GDP. Earlier, quarterly GDP information was issued to the electronic and print media through a press release. Since the first quarter of 2002, a press conference was held with the release of each quarterly report to enhance public awareness of issues of economic interest.",

In May 2002, the Department conducted a seminar on Provincial Estimation and Analysis of Regional Economic Activity in Sri Lanka, as regional development is a key pillar of the overall development policy framework of the government. The Department also published a paper on these Provincial GDP estimates during the year.

The officers who were trained abroad were also closely monitored by encouraging them to make presentations at the Bank after training with a view to sharing their knowledge with the other staff. A Training Bulletin in electronic form was also launched by the Department on its website, facilitating the dissemination of selected trainee reports submitted by officers after training. Two volumes consisting of 10 articles have been inserted in the Bulletin during the year. In addition, a weekly seminar series was also conducted by the Department with the objective of imparting knowledge on current economic, banking and other general issues. These seminars were conducted by eminent persons from institutions in Sri Lanka and abroad, as well as by officers of the Bank; 47 such seminars were conducted during the year.",
