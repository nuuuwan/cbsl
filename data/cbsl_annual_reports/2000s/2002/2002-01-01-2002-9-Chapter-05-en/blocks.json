    "text": "Vital institutional and market reforms were introduced in 2002 to remove supply bottlenecks, raise operational efficiency, create markets for healthy competition, rationalise pricing policies and promote private investment. Reforms specifically covered electricity, petroleum, bunker fuel supply, civil aviation, telecommunications and passenger transportation, as well as regulatory aspects of utility services. These reforms are expected to eliminate prolonged structural rigidities in these sectors and generate significant long-term economic benefits. Lack of a rational pricing policy has been a major impediment to the development of infrastructure services. In most instances, e.g., supply of electricity, petroleum, passenger transportation, domestic water supply and postal services, tariffs have been below cost recovery prices, although the general public eventually bears the burden, including the costs of inefficiency, through increased government taxes. This system discourages the private sector's entry, forcing the government to shoulder the full burden eventually, inhibiting further investments in the needed infrastructure in the country. A rational, flexible and transparent pricing policy carries benefits to both suppliers and consumers and to the economy as a whole through reduced uncertainty, price decreases in case of reductions in input cost, neutrality on the budget and on the macro economy and through reducing price distortions in the market. In 2002, the government introduced an automatic price adjustment mechanism for petroleum products and a flexible bus fare policy for road passenger transportation. However, competitive market conditions, along with a sound regulatory framework, must exist in order to reap maximum benefits from a flexible pricing policy. Further, a flexible pricing policy needs to be extended to cover other utility services, particularly electricity, water and rail services. The government also initiated action to create competitive markets for petroleum products, bunker fuel supply and electricity generation and distribution. The local market for petroleum products was opened to competition in 2002 after over 40 years of monopoly held by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) since its establishment in 1961. Further, with a view to creating an efficient market for bunker fuel supply, Lanka Marine Services (pvt.) Ltd. (LMS) was privatised in 2002. A new Electricity Reform Act was passed in Parliament in 2002, providing the legal framework necessary to effect reforms in the electricity sector. Under the reforms, the main activities of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will be unbundled and a broad based electricity generation and",

A new communications policy was announced in 2002, facilitating further liberalisation of telecommunication services, including operation of international gateways. The long awaited reforms in the civil aviation sector were realised in 2002 with the transformation of the Department of Civil Aviation to an Authority, with more flexibility for policymaking and implementation. Meanwhile, attempts were made to introduce public sector - private sector partnerships for the operation of road passenger transportation managed by Regional Bus Companies (Cluster Bus Companies). A final decision on the manner of divestiture was to be taken in 2003. Action taken towards the establishment of the Public Utility Services Commission of Sri Lanka (PUSCSL) was an important step forward in building consumer and investor confidence in a market-based, competitive utility services system. It is essential to implement appropriate reforms with respect to the remaining areas, particularly railways and postal services. Meanwhile, government continued to implement educational reforms introduced in 1998 and health reforms introduced in 1997. While an uneconomic pricing policy restricted the private sector's entry, public investment in infrastructure development fell further in 2002, mainly due to continued budgetary constraints. Public investment in economic infrastructure dropped to 3.3 per cent of GDP, while investment in social infrastructure remained unchanged at 1 per cent of GDP in 2002. This level of investment is barely sufficient to cover wear and tear of the existing stock of infrastructure. Therefore, given",

    "text": "Economic development and the status of health are mutually interdependent. The health status of a country is generally recognised as an outcome of development. However, the contribution of a better health status towards economic development does not appear to be recognised by a wide spectrum of policy makers. In this regard, the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (CMH) established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2000 emphasises that investment in health will yield enormous economic benefits, especially in developing countries. It further indicates that the linkages between health, poverty reduction and long-term economic growth are much stronger than is generally understood. In the meantime, the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) adopted at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, called for a dramatic reduction of poverty and a marked improvement in the health of the poor. The financial strategy under MDG envisages an increase in domestic budgetary resources for health of 1 per cent of GNP by 2007 and 2 per cent of GNP by 2015, including a better prioritisation of health services. Increased donor assistance is also expected to achieve these goals. Taxing the surplus of the plantation sector in the 1940s and 1950s and heavy reliance on taxes on international trade in the 1960s and 1970s enabled the government to have high direct investments in the health sector and heavy involvement in the implementation of many other social welfare programmes. This enabled Sri Lanka to stand more or less on par with developed country health standards in terms of death rates, infant and maternal mortality rates and life expectancy. However, with worsening budgetary developments and competing demands from defence related expenditure, Sri Lanka's investments in the health sector fell below the required levels in the 1990s, despite the emerging health issues in the country. According to Sri Lanka - National Health Accounts (June 2002) compiled by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), total national health expenditure, as a proportion of GNP, was 3.5 per cent in 1999. The government's contribution in total health expenditure was 48 per cent, while that of households was 46 per cent. The balance was financed by employers (3 per",

This reveals that there is an enormous potential for market-based health investment systems through appropriate private investment friendly policy changes. Hence, increased participation by the private sector, promotion of private insurance and social insurance schemes will be helpful in increasing investment in the health sector. A series of health sector problems, both in the current health status of the country and in the health services, has been identified (Poverty, Transition and Health, WHO, Colombo, March, 2002). Major problems in the current health status have been identified as the high level of malnutrition mainly among children and pregnant women, resurgence of communicable diseases such as malaria and dengue, an increasing rate of STD/ AIDS infection, increase in non-communicable diseases such as heart diseases, diabetes, hypertension and mental illness and changing life styles leading to substance abuse, unhealthy eating patterns, depression and suicide. In the case of health services, the major problems identified are deficiencies in health promotion, weak preventive care services, problems in the curative health services such as lack of trained personnel, weak management and lack of regulation. In addition, problems such as unequal distribution of available resources, lack of appropriate referral systems and congestion in some hospitals, while others are under-utilised, continued to loom over the health system of the country. In 2002, the Health Ministry continued to implement key recommendations made by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Health in 1997. These included the development of at least one hospital in each district, strengthening health services for the disabled, elderly, and mental patients, the development of health promotional programmes, reforms in the organisational structure and the development of human resources. Under the programme to develop at least one hospital in each district, steps were taken to develop 28 hospitals under the allopathic",

However, the high rate of literacy has not been translated to satisfactory learning achievements gearing towards sustainable economic development. 'The Future - Regaining Sri Lanka' Report highlights a number of constraints in the present education system. They relate to quality, institutions, language and the tertiary education system. Regional disparities in service delivery, legislative constraints preventing private sector participation, inadequate teacher deployment especially in remote areas, excessively centralised education management, acute shortage of quality inputs in classrooms, inequitable distribution of educational resources and insufficient attention to the role of education in promoting social harmony in a multicultural society have been identified as quality and institutional constraints. The lack of competence in international languages, especially English, limits participation in the global market place and in the domestic private sector. Serious inadequacy in tertiary education opportunities, as well as skill and competency gaps among university graduates, has also been a serious problem.",

    "text": "marginally to 21 in 2002. At end 2002, there were 80 private schools with 96,917 students and 599 pirivena with 54,968 students. The number of students in private schools has been increasing in recent years. The number of teachers in government schools increased marginally to 191,812 in 2002, while teachers in private schools increased by 6 per cent to 4,584 during the year. There are a large number of international schools in the county serving local students. They prepare students for overseas qualifications, which in turn enable the qualifying students to seek admission to foreign universities. These schools are principally disciplined by the market, since the educational attainments maintained by the schools serve as a guide for parents to patronise such schools. The competition among the schools to retain existing students and attract new students has prompted their boards of management to continue to review the operations, teacher qualifications and quality standards in order to remain competitive in the market. It is important to have a market based monitoring system for international schools for purposes of guidance. Several educational programmes were implemented in 2002 to improve the quality of education and the effectiveness of educational reforms. In order to strengthen school management, action was taken to establish School Boards under a School Based Management (SBM) system. A School Based Assessment (SBA) system was introduced to promote the quality of education through an understanding of student performance by both teachers and parents within the classroom itself. Zonal Monitoring Boards were established to monitor the programmes introduced under the GCE (A/L) reforms within each zone. Further, a new model primary schools project commenced in 2002 with the objective of minimising the acute competition for admission of children to Grade 1 in popular schools. Meanwhile, 381 schools were selected on a Divisional Secretariat basis for development of infrastructure under Navodya schools project. Teacher training is crucial to improving the quality of education. It has been indicated that by 2002, almost all untrained Sinhala medium teachers had been provided with appropriate training at Teacher Training Colleges. In addition, steps were taken to form Teacher Quality Circles to improve the teaching of subjects through mutual learning processes. Accordingly, teachers were encouraged to meet at Divisional and Zonal levels in subject groups, and discuss their problems and share experience. Government sponsored student welfare programmes continued to be implemented in 2002. Material for school uniforms was provided to around 4 million students at a cost of Rs. 999 million, while the free distribution of school textbooks cost the government Rs. 950 million. In addition, various scholarship programmes and nutritional programmes were also implemented for the benefit of talented and underprivileged students. Past experience reveals that such universal free facilities act contrary to the development of a",

The Secondary Education Modernisation (SEM) Project, which commenced in 2000 to improve the quality of secondary school education, was also in progress. In addition, the Primary Maths project and the Primary English Language Project funded by Department of Foreign International Development (DFID), United Kingdom, the Basic Education Sector Programme funded by Germany and the Junior School Improvement Project, funded by JICA-Japan, were also in progress in 2002. In consideration of the significant economic and social opportunities available in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, the government has given foremost priority to training students in this sector through the provision of institutional support. Students need to be increasingly more computer literate to face economic and social challenges in the future and a national policy for information technology in school education was introduced in 2002. Accordingly, several steps were taken to improve computer education at school level. At end 2002, there were 220 computer-learning centres and 700 multimedia rooms established in identified schools, but this still covered less than 10 per cent of all schools. Further, a total of 72 computer resource centres were functioning island-wide. Action was also taken to introduce Information Technology (IT) as a common subject for Grade 12 students, while establishing 8 provincial information technology centres. In order to improve the teaching of IT subjects, 6,400 teachers from selected schools were trained in 2002. Several steps were taken to reduce the shortage of teachers in difficult areas. It has been decided to give more opportunities to applicants from remote areas for admission to National Colleges of Education. It has also been decided to establish a systematic exchange of teachers among provinces and to give incentives to teachers serving in difficult areas. In any case, a consistent and non-discriminatory national policy on teacher transfers is needed for the smooth functioning of schools. Total government expenditure on education, including higher education was Rs. 37,209 million in 2002, a 32 per cent increase over the previous year. Total expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 2.4 per cent in comparison to 2.0 per cent in 2001. According to the 1996/97 Consumers' Finance and Socio-economic Survey, total private expenditure on education was Rs. 10,552 million, at 1996/97 prices.",

University education reforms covering curriculum development, career guidance, quality assurance and accreditation, corporate planning and legislative requirements were in progress in 2002. More attention was paid to career guidance related activities, self-development activities, increase of access to higher education and promotion of postgraduate training and research. Several private and public institutions, which have been granted degree-awarding status, enrolled students for bachelors/diploma and postgraduate degree courses. The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology enrolled 1,065 students to follow degree/diploma and postgraduate courses. New admissions to the Open University were 9,523, a 9 per cent increase over 2001. The total number of students enrolled in various courses in the Open University was 20,995 in 2002. Over 800 students in various disciplines such as Education, Management, Law, Social Sciences, Industrial Engineering, Construction Management, Engineering Technology, Natural Science and Nursing graduated from the Open University in 2002. Insufficient opportunities for higher education create serious economic, social and political problems and could also lead to social unrest among youth in the country. The relatively high enrolment in secondary education exerts intense pressure for the very limited places available in universities, which are almost entirely controlled by the government. In the absence of sufficient funds with the State to expand tertiary education opportunities in the country, the emergence of the private sector as a provider of higher education opportunities has now become inevitable. What is needed is accreditation, monitoring and establishment of a regulatory framework. Due to lack of opportunities within the country, a large number of students enrol for various courses overseas at very high cost. In 2002, outward remittances of foreign exchange for educational purposes amounted to around US dollars 16 million. A global development in university education since the late 1990s has been the distance delivery of undergraduate courses in Economics, Management, Accountancy and Finance through the use of advanced communication and information technology. Many reputed universities in Western countries, especially USA and UK, have resorted to this option since it is cost efficient, convenient and capable of having a wide outreach across the globe. In addition, universities in UK and Australia have commenced accreditation of local institutions in developing and middle income countries as a way to expand into outside markets. Hence, the conventional system of educating students by admitting them to a university is no longer the only method of providing higher education to those aspiring to obtain such education. This option has to be seriously explored by Sri Lanka, which is facing a serious",

Postal infrastructure represents one of the largest networks of service delivery systems in the country, but remains largely under-utilised. Fast growing information technology, rapidly changing demand for communications services, adoption of institutional reforms elsewhere in the economy and more importantly, liberalisation of markets, create a strong demand for the transformation of postal services. Post offices need to diversify their products and offer innovative services to the public for the long-term sustainability of the service. The postal service can offer newer services such as financial services, electronic money transfers, insurance and pension related services, utility bill payments, e-government services, e-commerce related activities such as information analysis, data banking etc. In this respect, it is essential to establish broad based institutional reforms and service modernisation.",

A new Electricity Reforms Act was promulgated in 2002 to restructure the power sector of the country with the objective of ensuring a stable and reliable power supply in the future. As part of the reforms, the main activities of the CEB will be unbundled, paving the way for a greater level of private sector participation, particularly in the areas of power generation and distribution. An Energy Supply Committee (ESC) was set up during the early part of 2002 with a two-year mandate to find immediate solutions to the existing problems of power shortages. However, firm action is yet to be taken to implement the planned power projects to provide electricity at an affordable and competitive price in the medium to long term. Past experience clearly shows that the economic and social costs of power shortages are extremely high and that high priced electricity would adversely affect energy intensive industries and the competitiveness of exports of the country.",

The government also intends to license a third player in the domestic petroleum market. The introduction of a flexible pricing policy for petroleum products, starting from January 2002, has been a stimulating development. It is important that the flexible pricing policy for petroleum products be implemented without ad hoc interference to ensure the credibility of the formula based pricing policy.

    "text": "The total installed capacity was 1,930 MW at end 2002, increasing marginally by 29 MW. This increase came entirely from the private sector with the commissioning of a 20 MW thermal power plant at Horana by Ace Power Ltd and some small hydropower plants with a capacity of 10 MW. The reliance of the power system on hydropower declined marginally to 60 per cent from 61 per cent at end 2001. Power cuts that were imposed in July 2001 continued till May 2002. Power cuts ended in May 2002 after the acquisition of 290 MW short-term emergency power plants from the private sector. A slight improvement in the availability of water in the reservoirs also helped to discontinue power cuts. Water storage in the reservoirs remained critically low during the first half of 2002. Water storage, at 30 per cent of capacity at the beginning of the year, dropped to a mere 12 per centl by April, but improved to 31 per cent by May 2002 and further to 62 per cent by end 2002. As under normal circumstances the demand for power rises by 8 - 10 per cent per annum, it is necessary to expand installed capacity by at least 100 MW each year to meet the growing demand. If a higher rate of economic growth, exceeding 5 - 6 per cent, is to be achieved, electricity capacity needs to be expanded at a faster rate. It is essential to pursue a carefully drawn power expansion plan.",

    "text": "Total electricity generation increased by 5 per cent to 6,951 GWh in 2002, against a 3 per cent drop in the preceding year. The private sector largely contributed to this increase. Power generation from private thermal and small hydropower plants increased by 10 per cent to 1,351 GWh, whereas power generation from CEB owned power plants dropped by 8 per cent to 4,546 GWh. As a result, the private sector share including emergency power and self generation, in total power generation increased to 35 per cent from 25 per cent a year ago. Hydropower generation by CEB, at 2,589 GWh in 2002, was the lowest since 1992. The dip in hydropower generation, resulting from poor rainfall in catchment areas, led CEB to resort to expensive thermal power and emergency hired power to meet the demand. CEB's thermal power generation increased by 3 per cent, while power generation from hired power plants increased by 168 per cent to 913 GWh., causing a heavy financial drain on CEB as the average power tariff was below the average thermal purchasing price. Although the power situation improved during the second half of the year and hired power plants were used sparingly, CEB still had to pay a capacity charge on hired power plants. Meanwhile, electricity generation under CEB's self-generation programme amounted to 141 GWh. The share of thermal power in total power generation increased to 61 per cent from 53 per cent in 2001. Despite the substantial increase in the tariff from April 2002, electricity sales by the CEB increased by 5 per cent to 5,502 GWh over sales in 2001. The suppressed demand due to power cuts has been estimated at 289 GWh in 2001 and 525 GWh in 2002. The consumer network expanded by 5 per",

Petroleum consumption had been growing generally at an average rate of about 12 per cent in recent years. Slow growth in petroleum consumption in 2002 was mainly due to slow growth in economic activities. Diesel consumption, which represents about 51 per cent of total petroleum consumption, increased by 5 per cent in 2002 against a 2 per cent drop in 2001. Increased demand for thermal power generation was mainly responsible for this expansion. Petrol consumption increased by 14 per cent, while furnace oil",

Total petroleum product imports by CPC and by the private sector amounted to 29 million barrels in 2002, an increase of 8 per cent over 2001. The average import price of crude oil (c&f), in US dollar terms, increased marginally to US dollar 25.13 per barrel in 2002. The average import price of US dollars 23 per barrel during the first half of the year increased to US dollars 27 per barrel during the second half. The increased threat of military action against Iraq and political turmoil in Venezuela, which led to cessation of oil exports from that country from December, were largely responsible for higher oil prices, particularly during the second half of the year.

The estimated cost of the Colombo-Kandy alternative highway project, under which a new highway runs from Kadawatha to Kandy, is Rs.29 billion. Detailed feasibility studies have been completed and the government has called for Expressions of Interest for implementation of the project on a BOO/BOT basis. RDA continued to implement the Road Network Improvement Project (RNIP) with assistance from ADB and JBIC to rehabilitate 345 kilometres of road and 47 bridges. In addition to road development and rehabilitation projects carried out with foreign assistance, RDA implemented a number of road projects covering all provinces, including periodic maintenance with local funds. However, at the implementation stage of road projects, RDA faces numerous problems, mainly associated with land acquisition, causing excessive delays in implementation. Inadequate coordination between highway authorities and utility agencies has also resulted in delays in project implementation. The total expenditure on road maintenance and the development of national highways in 2002 was Rs.9,877 million. This was a 6 per cent drop over the previous year. Of the total expenditure, around 58 per cent was from the Consolidated Fund, while the balance was received as foreign assistance.",

Meanwhile, the rail passenger service, in terms of quality and reliability, deteriorated further mainly due to financial constraints and operational deficiencies. However, studies were in progress to find ways and means to revitalise rail services with public-private partnerships.

    "text": "in 2001. The average number of RTC buses operated per day declined by 310 to 5,412, whereas the number of private busses increased by 117 to 10,981. In terms of vehicle utilisation, on average, an RTC bus ran 200 kilometres per day, while a private sector bus ran 132 kilometres per day, indicating that private buses are relatively idle. This is mainly the result of the single crew system of private bus operations. In contrast, RTCs follow a pooling system, extending the bus-operating period. The re-organisation of private bus operators in a formal way would help optimal utilisation of buses and facilitate monitoring and regulation. During the year, the total operated kilometerage by RTCs and private operators declined by 2 per cent to 925 million kilometers. The decline was a combined outcome of marginal increases in the operations of private buses and a slight decline in operations of RTCs. In terms of passenger kilometers, both sectors recorded marginal increases. In 2002, consolidated total revenue and expenditure of RTCs marginally increased to Rs. 9,424 million, and Rs. 11,604 million, respectively. As a result, RTCs recorded an operating loss of Rs.2,180 million during the year. However, some RTCs were operating at breakeven point. The loss making RTCs financed their financial gap with suppliers' credit, use of termination benefits of employees, bank loans and overdrafts and budgetary transfers. Under these circumstances, the failure to adopt the fare increase granted by the National Transport Commission (NTC) in July 2002 further worsened the finances of RTCs. Government current transfers to RTCs amounted to Rs. 1,155 million in 2002. Further, RTCs received Rs. 525 million from the Treasury as subsidies for the provision of season tickets to school children at a concessionary rate and for the operation of bus services on uneconomic routes in rural areas. The Ministry of Transport introduced a passenger fare policy covering both private and public road passenger transportation sectors in 2002. Ad hoc fare revisions, which have been the practice, have been a major obstacle to quality improvement and capacity expansion in that sector. It is essential that this fare policy be implemented effectively. In terms of the bus fares policy, bus fares will be considered for revision annually, from 01 August every year. NTC will monitor cost escalation and calculate price movements in each cost component of the formula and will recommend appropriate fare revisions. Major components of the formula include fuel costs (27 per cent), crew costs (22 per cent), repairs (12 per cent), service, lubricants, tires and tubes (11 per cent), depreciation (10 per cent), finance costs and risks (10 per cent) and overheads costs (8 per cent). An interim fare revision will be granted where there is a rapid increase in the diesel price during the year. Additional benefits of the fare policy would be the gradual elimination of existing anomalies in fare stages and the re-adjustment of fare stages applicable to all routes. In terms of the formula, NTC allowed a 15 per cent bus fare increase with effect from 01 July 2002 after taking into account the previous fare revision granted in January 2001.",

The Public Enterprise Reforms Commission (PERC) invited expressions of interest from private investors to acquire 39 per cent of the equity in 11 RTCs. The management of those companies is to be offered to successful bidders. Subsequently, an investor was selected to manage 6 RTCs and the deal is expected to be finalised during early 2003. Action has already been initiated to divest the remaining RTCs, Vavuniya Peoplised Transport Service Ltd. (VPTSL) and Northern Transport Company Ltd. (NTCL). Several measures have been adopted in recent years to mitigate traffic congestion, particularly around schools in major cities. During 2002, the Ministry of Transport and NTC, together with the Ministry of Education, put into operation 49 school buses covering 10 schools in Colombo with a view to reducing the number of vehicles on the road. However, a sound long-term policy and concerted efforts are needed to mitigate traffic congestion in major cities.",

During the year, NTC carried out checks on buses in various parts of the country to detect violations of route permit conditions. The Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) registered 113,351 vehicles in 2002 against 72,634 vehicles registered in 2001. Vehicle registration in 2001 was the lowest in the last ten years due to the contraction of the economy in 2001. The termination of concessionary duty permits in 2000 also has had an impact on this drop. The total number of vehicles registered in 2002 included 1,429 buses, 20,876 three wheelers, 54,762 motorcycles and 12,003 motorcars. During the year, DMT introduced several policies and activities to facilitate its clients. Accordingly, the Department introduced a one-day service for vehicle transfers and a one-day service, namely 'Green Channel Service', for new registrations. With a view to avoiding delays in registration, DMT stopped vehicle inspection at the time of new registrations. Meanwhile, new registration of motorcycles was decentralised by handing over the authority for registration to the respective Divisional Secretariats.",

    "text": "In spite of financial difficulties and operational inefficiencies, Sri Lanka Railways (SLR), showed a slight improvement in 2002, in terms of scale of operation, compared with 2001. Goods transportation improved noticeably during the year. Despite various operational constraints and qualitative setbacks in SLR's passenger transportation, it carried 106 million passengers, recording a 10 per cent growth over the previous year. The passenger kilometerage of SLR increased by 3 per cent. These improvements were partly due to a shift of some passengers from road transportation to rail, because traveling by bus was more expensive. Goods transportation showed a significant increase of 20 per cent in 2002, despite freight rates being raised by 50 to 250 per cent, with effect from September 2001. As in previous years, train services on the Northern line were operated only up to Vavuniya, on the Mannar line up to Medawachchiya and on the Eastern line only up to Valachchenai due to damage or destruction of rail track as a result of terrorist activities. With the ongoing peace process, the challenging task is restoring the train services on these lines. Steps have been taken to reconstruct the Eastern railway line up to Baticaloa during the year. The Northern line, extending from Vavuniya to Kankasanthurai (155 kms.), and the Mannar line (107 km) needs complete reconstruction. Efforts are being made to reconstruct the Northern and Eastern railway lines. According to provisional estimates, a sum of Rs. 8,000 million will be required for reconstruction activities and to recommence train services on these lines. Reconstruction work on the Baticaloa Line (30 kms.) has commenced in 2002. There are a series of impediments to the efficient operation of SLR. SLR owns only 133 locomotives and power sets for daily operations, though it needs 151 to meet the demand and to operate as per timetables. The old and obsolete nature of existing rolling stock and decaying rail track, un-standardised sleepers, shortage of ballast, and outdated signalling systems have adversely affected the provision of a satisfactory service and the maintenance of safety standards. There were 104 derailments and 543 locomotive failures in 2002 compared to 96 derailments and 671 locomotive failures in 2001. The punctuality of commuter train services remained at around 80 - 85 per cent in 2002. The average locomotive failure rate per month decreased marginally from 56 in 2001 to 54 in 2002. The maintenance cost of rolling stock has been very high due to the obsolete nature of most locomotives and power sets. For some locomotives spare parts are not available in the market and therefore, high costs are incurred to reproduce them. Lack of capital infusion to the SLR from the government has further deteriorated the service. A broad-based restructuring program, based on public sector - private sector partnership with a self-financing mechanism, would help to solve operational deficiencies in SLR without imposing much of a burden on the government budget.",

Freight services were responsible for 40 per cent of the increased revenue. The growth in operating expenditure was mainly due to increases in salaries and wages (by 10 per cent) and fuel costs (by 26 per cent). Consequently, the operating loss of SLR increased by 8 per cent to Rs. 1,966 million in 2002. In a situation where operating expenditure has been rising constantly, it is difficult to justify the non-adjustment of rail fares since 1996, at least to cover partially the operating losses. In 2002, several steps were taken to improve railway management, particularly in the areas of planning, human resources development and information technology. Further, with a view to enhancing the efficiency and quality of the rail service, an Indian study team carried out an investigation to identify options and strategies to introduce public-private partnerships in railway operations. Their recommendations are expected in early 2003.",

The September 11 terrorist attack in USA crippled the global air travel industry reducing aviation activity, especially tourism.

The total revenue of SLA in 2002 grew by 12 per cent to Rs. 31,583 million, while total operating expenditure dropped by 15 per cent to Rs. 31,558 million. As a result, SLA reported an operating profit before tax of Rs.25 million during the year. CAASL became functional with effect from 27 December 2002. All the functions and responsibilities of DCA were vested with CAASL. According to the Act, CAASL will be the principal regulatory authority in civil aviation operations in the country. Further, CAASL will formulate a national aviation policy, prepare aviation development plans, provide aviation safety, issue licences, certificates and permits and monitor commercial air services. The civil aviation industry has vast potential to expand and substantially increase its value addition to the economy, exploiting its advantageous geographical location.

The total cargo handed at all three ports during 2002 rose by 5 per cent to 28 million metric tons. Improved performance at the Port of Colombo in 2002 was mainly from the operations of South Asia Gateway Terminals (Pvt.) Limited (SAGT). SAGT's share in total cargo handled increased further to 21 per cent in 2002 from 13 per cent in 2001. The performance of SLPA, in terms of container throughput and transshipment container handling, declined by 14 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively. The main reasons for the decline of SLPA's activities were the closing down of the Jaye Container Terminal (JCT) for several months for dredging and expansion, the closing down of the Unity Container Terminal for construction, and other construction work carried out in feeder berths. However, the overall port activities of SAGT improved significantly during the year. At SAGT, container throughput increased by 69 per cent, while transshipment handling grew by 57 per cent. Port productivity indicators improved in 2002. In respect of main line vessels, SLPA gantry crane moves per hour increased from 16 in 2001 to 24 in 2002, while SAGT gantry crane moves increased from 15 to 25. The average delay in berthing at SLPA terminals declined from 3.2 hours to 1.9 hours. The productivity gains at the terminals managed by SLPA, especially at JCT, were attributable to certain operational reorganisations introduced during the year. The system of 'speed money' given to operational staff by shipping lines were eliminated and an alternative productivity based Target Bonus System was introduced. Cargo handling on public holidays and other measures such as the provision of better transport for employees also contributed to improve productivity. In order to improve port productivity on a sustainable basis and to reduce operating expenses, SLPA introduced a long awaited voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce its redundant staff. SLPA had a labour force of 17,910 at end 2002, which is considered to be about double the optimal level. Under the VRS, 2,993 employees retired from port services. Along with productivity improvements SLPA was able to attract seven new main line services in 2002. SLPA entered Terminal Services Agreements (TSA) with Hanjin Shipping Lines, Sealand (the largest container operator in the world) and APL the fourth largest shipping line. It has been widely held that Sri Lanka has not been able to exploit the maximum potential from port and shipping services, given its strategic location in the Indian Ocean.

    "text": "compared to 58,760 in 2001. There is a shortage of around 400,000 housing units in the country. In addition, a large number of existing housing units are of substandard quality requiring reconstruction. State sector housing programmes mainly focus on meeting the housing needs of low and middle-income families, while private sector housing programmes are largely focused on middle and high-income families, particularly in the urban sector. The government continued to provide direct assistance to low income families to build or upgrade their houses. BOI offered attractive concessions to private investors who undertake construction of medium density residential housing projects. In the meantime, the government continued to undertake special housing projects to relocate slum and shanty dwellers, thereby releasing prime urban lands for commercial purposes. Scarcity of lands for housing, especially in urban areas, and delays and difficulties in obtaining title documents restrain the growth of the housing finance market. Further, reluctance on the part of some private funding institutions to use Sawarnaboomi and Jayaboomi deeds as collateral also restricts private sector housing finance activities. Financial institutions also face difficulties in granting loans to purchase houses in condominiums, as titles to such property are available only after the construction of the condominiums. The government introduced a special housing loan scheme for middle-income earners in 2002. Under this programme, government intends to provide, through housing finance institutions, 10,000 housing loans of up to Rs.500,000 each at a subsidised interest rate of 10.5 per cent per annum with a repayment period of 15 years. Government has allocated Rs.300 million to meet the interest subsidy in 2003. The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA), the Ministry of Fisheries and Ocean Resources (MFOR) and the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT) play major roles in the provision of public sector housing. NHDA is the apex institution responsible for implementing key public",

NHDA provides a maximum loan of Rs.50,000 to a beneficiary to build or upgrade his own house under these programmes. NHDA increased its activities in 2002 when compared to 2001. It implemented a new housing programme called 'Pradeshiya Gamudawa' to uplift living conditions of rural communities in the districts of Nuwara Eliya, Hambantota, Kalutara and Anuradhapura, during 2002. NHDA assisted through the provision of loans, grants and technical assistance. Basic utility services and public amenities were also provided with the assistance of other government agencies. Total disbursements under NHDA programmes decreased by 19 per cent to Rs 489 million in 2002. The number of housing units whose construction commenced during 2002 increased by 19 per cent. Funding requirements of NHDA are met partly from the recovery of previous loans. Government transfers to NHDA amounted to Rs. 230 million in 2002. The loan recovery rate of NHDA improved from 70 per cent in 2001 to 84 per cent in 2002. MFOR continued implementing the Diyawara Gammana housing programme. During 2002, a total of 4 housing schemes with 426 housing units were completed under this programme. MFOR disbursed Rs.3.5-million during the year for this purpose. PHDT continued implementing several housing construction and upgrading programmes in the estate sector under the Plantation Development Support Programme (PDSP) in 2002. The housing construction programme directly financed under the PDSP provides Rs. 85,200, comprising a grant of Rs. 40,000 and a loan component of Rs. 45,200 to an estate sector employee. Further, PHDT implemented several other housing construction and upgrading projects with the collaboration of NHDA and commercial banks.

As a result, many on\u00adgoing urban development projects were either postponed or progressed slowly and the commencement of new projects was postponed. The Urban Development Authority (UDA) has been vested with responsibility for the planned development of major urban centres in the country. Its functions include guidance, facilitation and regulation of urban development through innovative and integrated planning. An efficient urban infrastructure system is essential for the smooth functioning of private and public institutions, as well as the economic and social well being of the urban community. It has been projected that one half of the estimated population would live in urban areas by 2010, if current population growth and urbanisation trends continue. Therefore, it is important that, in light of financial constraints in the public sector, an environment conducive to private sector participation in the provision of urban public goods, is created, wherever feasible. Scarcity of land has been cited as one of the main obstacles for further expansion in urban services in the City of Colombo as well as in most other major urban centres. A project has been designed to identify unproductive and vacant land in the city of Colombo for expansion of urban services. Large extents of unproductive lands in Colombo belonging to the government have been identified as suitable for development work in the Colombo Metropolitan Regional Structure Plan (CMRSP). It has been envisaged to shift most administrative establishments out of Colombo to release valuable land and develop the city as a commercial centre.

Work on the access road to the proposed IT Park at Malabe and the acquisition of land for construction of infrastructure for the same project were in progress. The total estimated cost of this project is Rs.900 million. Two IT companies have already located in the park, while 7 companies are waiting to obtain land in the Park. The main operational activities of UDA include the construction of administrative complexes, commercial complexes, town improvement projects, industrial projects, integrated projects and social and cultural projects. In addition, UDA implemented several projects on behalf of public sector institutions and continued to maintain the Land Bank. The total expenditure on implementation of these programmes amounted to Rs.481 million, a decline of 63 per cent from the previous year. The sources of funds for these projects were the Consolidated Fund (52 per cent), UDA's own funds (30 per cent) and funds received from client institutions (18 per cent). Of the total investment, 66 per cent (Rs.319 million) was on projects undertaken on behalf of client institutions, while 12 per cent was for the construction of commercial complexes.

    "text": "It has been revealed in several surveys that the proportion of households with access to safe drinking water is about 70 per cent, of which only about 35 per cent have access to pipe borne water. The main objective of the national water supply policy is to ensure that all residents have access to safe drinking water by 2010. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) aims to expand the water supply coverage to about 80 per cent by 2005. A substantial reduction in non-revenue water distribution, which presently stands at around 31 per cent, and a 24-hour supply of pipe borne water to all consumers by 2005 are the other major objectives of NWSDB. NWSDB has estimated that in order to achieve these objectives, an investment of Rs. 10 -12 billion per year would be needed. The government of Sri Lanka, on average, allocates about Rs.5 billion per year for water supply projects. Therefore, it is necessary to attract an equal amount of private investment in the water supply sector to fill the investment gap and to achieve the set objectives. At the same time, community organisations and NGOs can play a significant role in the distribution and maintenance of water supply projects located in rural areas. There can be minimum involvement by the government in the",

The active role of local government institutions is equally important in expanding access to safe drinking water. Two pilot projects, namely, the Greater Negombo and the Kalutara to Galle water distribution projects, have been identified by the government for private sector participation. Initially, consultants have been appointed to study the best model of private sector participation suitable for these two pilot projects. It is expected to mobilise a private sector operator in Negombo in early 2004. In order to encourage private sector participation, a cost effective and flexible pricing policy and an effective regulatory mechanism needs to be established. The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, once established, will be responsible for regulating the water sector in the country. The demand for pipe borne water has increased continuously with population growth, urbanisation, and expansion of industries and commercial activities, and because pollution and drying up of natural water sources make them unusable. There is a large unmet demand. Pipe borne water is presently available only to about one third of all households. A poor water supply heightens risk of water borne diseases and other public health hazards. On the supply side, NWSDB stands as the apex institution responsible for the development, distribution and maintenance of water supply schemes. NWSDB operated 275 water supply schemes with 727,554 connections in 2002. The total water supply of NWSDB increased by 2 per cent to 350 million cubic metres (MCM) in 2002 over the previous year. NWSDB provided 62,388 new connections during the year. NWSDB implemented 82 upgrading and rehabilitation projects at a cost of Rs.406 million during the year. An additional population of 1,265,000 will benefit once these projects are completed. Total investment in the water supply sector by NWSDB grew sharply, more than twofold, to Rs.8,159 million in 2002 from Rs.3,896 million in 2001. Of the total investment, 85 per cent was on new projects, while the balance was on the rehabilitation of existing projects. Approximately 68 per cent of these funds were received on concessional terms from foreign funding agencies including ADB, JBIC, IDA and KFW. NWSDB implemented several major water supply projects in 2002. The Small Towns Water Supply Project (STWSP) funded by ADB continued during 2002. This project aims to provide water supply and sanitation facilities to 47 small towns (population below 6,000) in the Kalutara, Kegalle, Anuradhapura, Monaragala, Puttalam and Hambantota districts. Community participation is expected at the implementation stage, as well as for maintenance. During 2002, construction work commenced on 6 sub-projects.

WBA clearly specifies the selection procedure, according to given criteria by an independent panel.

As a result the total number of households receiving the Samurdhi income supplement declined by 24 per cent to 1,488,493 by end of 2002. However, to encourage ineligible families to exit the programme, departing families were paid Rs. 140 per month to cover expenses for compulsory deposits (Rs. 100), social security contributions (Rs. 30), and the housing lottery (Rs. 10), so that they could continue to benefit from other Samurdhi programmes. The main objective of the Samurdhi Programme is to improve the living standards of the poor with direct assistance to vulnerable groups and to assist in various other programmes such as small scale infrastructure development, training and financial and social security to raise the income levels of the poor. The main institutions involved in the implementation of the Samurdhi Programme are Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka (SASL), Department of the Commissioner General of Samurdhi (DCGS) and the Department of Poor Relief (DPR). The number of Samurdhi beneficiary families, which was about 1.5 million in 1995, increased to around 1.9 million by 2002. About 50 per cent of the total population received direct benefits. As a result, the cost of the programme increased rapidly to Rs.12 billion in 2001 from Rs.8 billion in 1995. At the same time, administrative expenses of the programme also increased significantly. Total administrative expenses of the entire Samurdhi programme amounted to Rs. 75 million in 2002.",

In addition to Samurdhi relief recipients, there were 83,171 families receiving nutrition allowances at end 2002. The total value of nutrition cards issued fell by 42 per cent to Rs. 80 million in 2002. In addition, a total of 145,777 families received assistance to the value of Rs. 1,453 million under the Samurdhi Dry Ration Scheme in 2002.

    "text": "5.9 Environment Developments on the macroeconomic front in 2002 are likely to have had a favourable impact on the environment as a whole. Lower interest rates, decelerating inflation, price liberalisation and structural reforms introduced in 2002 would have had positive impact on the environment, while tight fiscal policy exerted adverse pressure on the environment as new investments to improve the environment both at national and sub-national levels were affected. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR), the institution setting the environment policy of the country, introduced several policy measures to protect the environment and to mitigate environment pollution, while the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) continued its monitoring, controlling and regulatory functions. There are a large number of NGOs engaged in promoting awareness about the damage to the environment. MENR took necessary steps to phase out the use of leaded gasoline and to introduce unleaded gasoline with effect from June 2002. The government approved the implementation of the new National Strategy for Solid Waste Management based on a three-year action programme. A policy decision was also taken to promote private sector participation in solid waste management. The National Environment Policy (NEP) document, which was drafted with public participation, has been forwarded for Cabinet approval. The draft NEP emphasises the importance of integrating environmental concerns with policies for sustainable economic development. To incorporate cleaner production technologies into the development process, MENR, in collaboration with the National Cleaner Production Centre (NCPC), initiated the preparation of a national policy on cleaner production in 2002. Further, in view of the rapidly deteriorating natural environment and increasing threats to wild life from human activities, MENR declared the Anawilundava Sanctuary and Kaudulla National Park in the North Central Province as protected areas.",

Further, an Air Resource Management Centre (Air MAC) was established to address air pollution issues. Several steps were taken to implement the Vehicle Emissions Control Programme effectively. Accordingly, 500 mechanics were trained in vehicle emissions reduction processes and 75 technicians were trained as resource persons. An institutional arrangement was also developed to function as vehicle emission testing centres covering whole island. Some environmental issues have global implications. Sri Lanka has ratified several international environmental treaties dealing with these issues. Accordingly, MENR continued to co\u00adordinate international conventions such as the Montreal Protocol on the use of substances that deplete the ozone layer, the Basle Convention on the Control of Trans Boundary Movement of Hazardous Waste, the United Nations Convention on Combating Land Degradation and Desertification and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A convention reference centre was established at MENR for co-ordination and implementation of international treaties. Sri Lanka has ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002. As a low green house gas (GHG) emission country, Sri Lanka qualifies to participate and benefit from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Under CDM, those countries whose per capita emission level is greater than the stipulated level (mostly developed countries), can claim emission-credits for emission-cutting investment projects in developing countries. The private sector could be encouraged to participate in environment friendly investment projects under CDM. Investments could be expected in the areas of energy, agriculture, land use, reforestation, adoption of energy efficient technologies and solid waste collection and disposal. In 2002, MENR prepared a national CDM strategy. CEA, the regulatory arm of the MENR, is mainly engaged in conducting Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), implementing the Environmental Protection Licences (EPL) scheme, enforcement of regulations, monitoring and in environment promotion activities. In 2002, CEA processed 280 EPL and issued 258 new EPL. CEA continued to monitor performance in industries in relation to the discharge of effluents, noise and wastewater, in order to determine compliance with set standards. During the year, CEA processed 71 EIAs and 11 projects were approved. CEA handled 885 public complaints in connection with environmental issues in 2002 compared to 997 in 2001.",
