While negative GDP growth in 2001 impacted adversely on overall employment generation in the early half of the year, the benign economic growth in 2002 led to an increase in economic activities and hence, employment opportunities, during the latter half. Further, the turnaround in the economy and the peaceful environment that prevailed during 2002 following the ceasefire in February led to positive expectations, thereby stimulating the overall economy and participation in economic activity. As a result, the labour force participation rate increased from 48.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2001 to 49.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2002 and the unemployment rate, which rose to a peak of 9.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2002, fell in the third quarter of 2002 to 9.1 per cent.",

Amendments to the Factory Ordinance of 1942 (FO), which was the first reform in the series, relaxed the number of overtime hours for female employees. The other three Acts, which were passed by Parliament in January 2003, were amendments to the Termination of Employment of Workmen Act of 1971 (TEWA), the Industrial Disputes Act of 1950 (IDA-1950) and the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act of 1956 (EWYCA). The highlight of the amended TEWA is the determination of a clear compensation formula for terminated workers and amendments to the IDA-1950 focussed on minimising time allocation for dispute settlement. Finally, the EWYCA amendments enhanced penalties for employers violating the conditions set out in the Act.",

The latter emphasises the need to remove existing constraints on private sector participation in economic activity.

The MPDI initiated a \"Youth Corps\", which will be a well planned and integrated package of employment-oriented training programmes for youth between the ages of 18 years and 28 years, to be launched during 2003. The MLE prepared the Draft National Employment Policy-2002 to prepare unemployed educated youth, not only for the domestic labour market, but also for the international labour market, by providing them with appropriate training with the support of the private sector. Furthermore, the proposed employment service outlets to be established throughout the country by the MLE will provide much needed support in identifying employment opportunities for unemployed educated youth throughout the country. In addition, the graduate employment programme, Tharuna Aruna, would be geared to function at a much faster speed than before in order to minimise the graduate unemployment problem.",

With the intention of overcoming this situation and in order to achieve a more diversified growth in foreign employment, the MLE, together with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), took various steps during 2002, not only to divert housemaids to other skilled jobs, but also to train them to be more",

In order to bring about greater equity and. industrial harmony, the governments of those countries enacted a number of laws to protect the working class from such \"exploitation\". At the same time, on the one hand, politicians made use of the culture of dependence of labour on the state to gain popularity and please the working class, which constituted a sizable section of their electorates, sometimes to the detriment of other social partners and the country as a whole. On the other hand, the confrontational attitude between two social partners, namely employers and workers, has continued for several decades since independence, because of the mistrust developed during the colonial era when the businesses were in the hands of the colonial power and the working class was of local origin. Meanwhile, the trade unions' militancy managed to secure certain rights of the workers at the cost of weakening the employer-employee relationship to some extent, and the state did very little or nothing to persuade labour and management to move towards a more constructive relationship which would lead to a smoothly functioning labour market.",

It prevented private firms with 15 or more employees laying off workers for non-disciplinary reasons without the prior written consent of the Commissioner General of Labour (Commissioner) or employee concerned. The latter obviously required an attractive compensation package. The absence of clear-cut compensation formulae for retrenchments and definition of the Commissioner's discretionary powers in the TEWA have been major obstacles, not only to restructuring of organisations, but also the attraction of investment for labour intensive industry.",

The mid-year population of a year subsequent to a census is estimated by projecting the census data in each district using the natural increase and net migration rates for that particular year. In the Census-2001, the final census was completely enumerated only in 18 districts and the population of the remaining 7 districts in the North and East were estimated using data from the partial enumeration. As the Census-2001 was completed only in 18 districts, the RGD's mid-year population estimates using this standard method were compiled only for those districts in 2002. The mid-year population estimates for the remaining 7 districts in the North and the East were directly obtained by the RGD from the Government Agents of those districts without using the Census-2001 estimates as base year estimates. In view of the different sources of statistics for these 7 districts in 2002, estimated changes over the previous year should be treated with some caution. Nevertheless, the relatively peaceful conditions that prevailed in the districts of the North and the East compared to the period before the ceasefire agreement between the Government and LTTE, may have led to significant in-migration to those districts. Some refugees who had fled to neighbouring countries and provinces may have returned. That would explain to some extent, on the one hand, the significant increase of population between 2001 and 2002 in Jaffna, Mulativu and Killinochi districts in the North, and Batticaloa and Trincomalee Districts in the East and, on the other hand, the noticeable decreases in the Mannar and Vavuniya districts of the North.",

According to enumerated results of the APSES, the total Public Sector employment declined by 0.9 per cent during 2002 compared to 2001. Semi-Government institutions were the sole contributor to this decline, recording a decline of 5.2 per cent compared to 2001. The shrinkage of employment through VRS, laying off of unproductive casual workers employed on ad hoc bases and early retirements without extending the period of work beyond 55 years led to the decline in the number of employees in the Semi-Government sector. Among the highest declines in employment in Semi-Government institutions, the Central Bank and Salu Sala reduced their numbers of employees through VRS, while the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Co-operative Wholesale Establishment mainly reduced their unproductive casual workers. Further, a significant reduction in the number of employees in People's Bank during 2002 provided an example of strict adherence to the official retirement age and the policy decision of non-recruitment of workers without clear justification. Recruitments of teachers to provincial schools contributed to the marginal increase of 0.5 per cent in Government institutions in 2002. Some decreases occurred in other Government institutions due to termination of contractual workers following the completion of projects.",

Initially, the Ministry will recruit 3,000 youth and train them as Youth Range Leaders.

Although, the departures during the first half of 2002 were marginally higher at 90,000 compared to 87,000 in the first half of 2001, the second half of 2002 generated more than the expected number of 108,000, and the number of departures was 114,000 compared to 97,000 in the second half of 2001. The increased demand and the absence of disruptions to flights such as those that affected departures in late 2001 following the terrorist attack at the Airport in July 2001 led to this high increase during the second half of 2002.",

In view of this dependence on housemaids and rising competition in this manpower category from other countries, skills training for housemaids to improve their quality of work and to diversify to other categories of skilled labour is urgently required. There will also be additional competition from Bangladesh since it is reported that they would lift the ban on women going abroad as domestic workers to the Middle East. The MLE, together with the SLBFE, has established training centres to train housemaids to be more competitive internationally and skills training centers to upgrade the skills of housemaids to engage in other skilled jobs, during 2002. The effects of these steps were evident from the increase in the number of departures for skilled labour from 36,800 in 2001 to 45,500 in 2002 and the increase in the share of skilled labour among manpower categories, from 20 per cent in 2001 to 22 per cent in 2002.",
