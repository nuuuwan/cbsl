    "text": "The growth in 2002, over a performance that plummeted in the previous year, was driven by several factors. The security situation, which improved with the uninterrupted continuation of the cease-fire that came into effect in late February, boosted consumer demand, as well as the shift to positive perceptions and attitudes, both domestically and internationally. The world economy that experienced difficulties in the previous year, regained some of its growth momentum in 2002, though at a slower pace than earlier projected. The partial recovery in markets that are of major importance to Sri Lanka, namely, USA, Europe and the Middle East, was particularly important for recovery in the domestic economy. Benign weather conditions after a severe drought that had prevailed in 2000/ 2001 supported the recovery in agriculture, while the discontinuation of power cuts impacted positively on industry and services. Meanwhile, the removal of the war risk insurance surcharge on sea and air travel improved external trade and tourist activities. Further, a decline in interest rates, commensurate with the deceleration in inflation, and improved",

NFIA, though continuously negative, improved in US dollar terms in 2002 owing to the decline in factor payments and increases in factor receipts.

The Agriculture sector, recovered significantly, but not completely, with the improvement in weather conditions. The growth in the Agriculture sector was 2.5 per cent in 2002, compared to a contraction of 3.4 per cent in the previous year. The industry sector continued to shrink during the first half of 2002, but regained some growth momentum during the latter half, recording a 1.0 per cent growth in 2002, due to both domestic and global factors, compared to a contraction of 2.1 per cent in 2001. The comparatively low performance in the Industry sector raises concerns, as this sector is crucial for the creation of employment opportunities and influences activities in the Services sector, as well as future economic growth. The Services sector, which contracted marginally by 0.5 per cent in the previous year, thrived in 2002, with a growth of 6.0 per cent, responding well to the increased demand for services such as trade, transport, communication, financial services and tourism, arising mainly from the improved security situation both locally and internationally. The overall recovery reported in 2002 was clearly centered on the performance in the Services sector which contributed 80 per cent of the GDP growth, claiming 53.6 per cent of total GDP in 2002, compared to 52.5 per cent in 2001.

The high concentration of economic activities in certain provinces, thereby generating considerable disparity in economic opportunities, would be an additional constraint to achieving this task, even with an efficient fiscal and monetary policy framework, unless policies are also geared towards overcoming barriers and exploiting opportunities for economic development at the regional level, as well. Early attention to this issue is critical, as widening regional economic disparities not only affect the achievement of a sustainable high overall economic growth directly, but also indirectly, through their potential impact on social and political stability in the country.",

    "text": "expansion in private consumption expenditure (PCE), which represented around 90 per cent of the total consumption expenditure. Government consumption expenditure declined, by 3.6 per cent, due to fiscal consolidation efforts. The expansion in consumption expenditure was nearly equal to the increase in GDP at market prices, signifying that marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is usually lower than one, was nearly equal to one. The MPC which ranged between 0.75 and 0.90 for the period of 1996-2001 rose to 0.95 in 2002. This unusual increase in consumption expenditure was explained by two factors. First there was an increase in demand, particularly in the Northern and Eastern provinces, which had been suppressed for many years due to the security situation that prevailed throughout the country. The demand for consumer goods, especially for imported consumer goods, rose significantly during the year. This was reflected in imports of consumer goods that showed a 22 per cent volume increase during the period. Second, the continuous decline in interest rates discouraged financial savings, further encouraging consumption. In real terms, PCE grew by 8 per cent, indicating an improvement in living standards.",

However, the Investment/GDP ratio, which dropped to 22.0 per cent in 2001 from the peak level of 28.0 per cent in 2000, declined to 21.3 per cent. Several factors contributed to this inadequate performance in capital formation. There was already excess capacity in the economy so that growth could be achieved without considerable improvement in capital stock in 2002. Though capital inflows grew rapidly, the commencement of several large-scale infrastructure projects that were earmarked did not materialize during the year. Most private investors preferred to follow a wait and see policy, due to uncertainties that prevailed on the political front, including their close monitoring of progress made on the peace process initiated at the beginning of the year. This curtailed the expansion of private capital formation. The poor performance of government investment under severe budgetary constraints, also contributed to the low level of total investment expenditure. Government investment expenditure, which increased by 3.0 per cent in 2001, deteriorated by 24.7 per cent in 2002. A notable fact was that, despite the decline in the investment ratio, capital formation rose in 2002, in real terms by 3.1 per cent, compared with a 17.5 per cent decline in 2001. The increase in capital stock was significant towards the very end of2002, indicating an accumulation of stocks for use in the following year and that the growth achieved in 2002 was predominantly based on efficient use of the prevailing capital stock. However, the decline in the investment ratio will not augur well for future economic growth. This emphasises the fact that the future economic growth will ultimately depend on the speedy implementation of structural reforms and finding a lasting solution to the civil conflict that will crucially affect future capital formation.",

Although private savings increased by 3.2 per cent in 2002, the private savings/GDP ratio dropped from 20.7 per cent to 19.0 per cent with the higher rate of growth of nominal GDP. The increase in consumption expenditure, as reflected by an MPC almost equal to one, and a sharp decline in interest rates eroded the propensity to save. On the positive side, government dis-savings, which had risen drastically during the previous two years, improved marginally due to the prudent budgetary policies that were followed. The national savings ratio also declined, but at a lower rate, from 20.3 to 19.7 per cent due to the improvement in net foreign private transfers which grew by 19.4 per cent. The resource gap, the investment- national savings gap as a ratio of GDP, stood at 1.6 per cent compared to 1.7 per cent recorded in 2001 and 6.6 per cent in 2000. However, the decline in the gap was a consequence of a faster decline in the private investment/GDP ratio, rather than an improvement in the national savings/GDP ratio.

A government decision to grant a rebate on chicken exports which was implemented in October 2002, contributed to this growth. Exports in 2003 are expected to increase further owing to this scheme. Though such rebates could contribute to promote exports in the short-run, it is necessary for the industry to improve productivity and cut down the cost of production in order to sustain this rate of growth in the long run in a competitive world. As a result of a poultry disease that prevailed in the first half of the year, production of eggs declined marginally during the year.

The demand for electricity grew by 5.3 per cent during the year, mainly due to growth in the manufacturing and commercial sectors. The hydropower generated by the CEB declined by 15 per cent due to the drought conditions that prevailed during the first half of the year and lower utilisation of hydropower with the greater usage of hired thermal power. Value added in the electricity sub sector declined by 2.1 per cent as a result of higher dependence on thermal power, which has high generation costs. In 2002,60 per cent of the total electricity was generated thermally, in comparison to 52 per cent in 2001. In April 2002, the CEB removed the 25 per cent fuel adjustment charge imposed on electricity consumption but increased the electricity tariff by around 37 per cent effective from 1 April 2002 to cushion against the high costs involved in thermal power generation and use of hired power plants.

The profits of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) recorded a notable increase of 33 per cent. This profit growth was attributed to the savings the SLT made as it was not required to pay any management fee following the expiration of the management agreement it had with NTT of Japan and increase in tariff charges by 15 per cent. The disconnection of 1,700 illegally used lines also contributed. At present, SLT has 760,000 subscribers and has provided 60,000 new connections during the year.",

This success was attributed to the improved management strategies and drastic improvements in the Navigation and Operational divisions of the Colombo Port. The removal of the war risk insurance surcharges on sea and air transport in March 2002 and smooth operations uninterrupted by labour issues also contributed positively to this growth.

The removal of the national security levy and turnover tax, and their increased efficiency through the use of cost effective methods also contributed to this growth.

Enhanced activities in the sub sectors of advertising, private education, janitorial services, television and broadcasting, and lotteries contributed to this growth. The demand for private education continued with the healthy competition created in recent years among institutional service providers for academic as well as professional courses. More private sector participation in road cleaning and garbage collection activities contributed to the growth in janitorial services. In 2002, tourist arrivals increased by 16.7 per cent to 393,171. This was largely due to the peaceful environment that prevailed in the country, particularly in relation to other competitor tourist destinations such as Bali that suffered setbacks in the aftermath of terrorist attacks, and the global promotional campaign spearheaded by the Ceylon Tourist Board. Arrivals from the Asian region increased by 59 per cent or by 53,332 partly due to a package of incentives to tourists from those regions till July 2002. Arrivals from India showed an increase of 106 per cent to 69,960. However, arrivals from Western Europe dropped by 1.8 per cent compared to 2001 due to lower arrivals from Germany in the first half of the year. Accordingly, the market share of the Asian region increased from 27 to 36 per cent, while the market share of Western Europe dropped from 61 per cent to 51 per cent in 2002. These factors have affected the foreign guest nights in graded hotels, which declined by 0.9 per cent in 2002. Hotels were able to improve occupancy levels to some extent from local guests nights, which showed an increase of 23 per cent. However, total guest nights in all graded hotels recorded an increase of only 4.2 per cent. Consequently hotel services, which suffered a severe setback in 2001 were not able to recover commensurate with the increase in tourist arrivals, and recorded a decline of 2.5 per cent in real terms in 2002.",

Food and non-alcoholic beverages emerged as the most important category in PCE, but the gradual decline in importance of this category was evident in 2002 too. The increase in PCE on food by 15 per cent, in current terms, was partly due to the increase in prices of food items such as rice, wheat flour, meat, fish and coconuts. The increase in PCE on the clothing and footwear category was due to the increase in purchase of clothing materials and ready-made garments. The price hikes in gas and other liquid fuels during 2002 have led to higher expenditure on utility services, while the increase in the number of subscribers by 20 per cent and the overall price increases in communication equipment and services has raised the expenditure in the communication category by 34 per cent, in current terms. The PCE on transport, which recorded a decrease of 10 per cent in 2001, grew by 38 per cent in 2002. The higher demand for passenger and goods transport, increase in fuel prices and purchasing of new vehicles for private consumption, as reflected in import statistics, contributed to the unusual increase. PCE on health increased by 28 per cent, mainly due to the increase in prices of pharmaceuticals and charges on medical services. PCE on miscellaneous goods and services, which includes financial services, insurance, personal care, personal effects and social protection, grew by 19 per cent. However, within this sub sector, the PCE on financial services fell mainly due to the fall in interest costs resulting from the low interest rates that prevailed in 2002.",

Government savings, which is defined as the current account balance of the government budget, although remaining in deficit, improved slightly by way of a reduction in the deficit in 2002 due to the prudent budgetary policies followed to curtail such deficit. The domestic savings/GDP ratio deteriorated, however, from 15.8 per cent to 14.6 per cent in 2002. The decline in the domestic savings ratio was due to the increase in private consumption expenditure. This decline does not augur well for future capital formation as it indicates a reduction in available resources from domestic sources for investment.",
