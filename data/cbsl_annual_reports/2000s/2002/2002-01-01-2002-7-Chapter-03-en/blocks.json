The output of major agricultural produce, viz. paddy, tea and rubber, improved from the low levels in the previous year. Paddy output grew by 6 per cent owing to an increase in both the extent sown and the extent harvested during both Maha and Yala seasons. Favourable weather continued to prevail during the year and the availability of irrigation water enhanced the acreage under paddy, which also resulted in a low availability of land for other field crops. Except potato and soybeans, the extents and the production of all the other field crops dropped during the year compared to 2001. Potato output, which has shown an increasing trend during the last few years, under a high import tariff protection, increased by a further 53 per cent during 2002.",

Any policy decision should also be backed by strong economic considerations such as raising food production in tandem with rising population, cost of enforcement of laws and the nature and reliability of evidence available against the use of GM foods. However, Sri Lanka's handling of the issue has been in a confused manner. GM foods were totally banned in Sri Lanka initially, without examining the practicability of the measure. Then, the decision was changed to a 'mandatory labelling' though there are no means of identifying transgressors of the requirement. Hence, it is advisable that decisions on important issues of this nature should be taken after weighing all the evidence for and against.",

Further, it increases the cost of production of plantation crops. The PDP report recommended that the government and RPCs sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on this issue. Some of the RPCs agreed to reduce their management fees, while some others are negotiating with the government on its request to reduce management fees in lieu of the government freezing the management rental at the 2001/2002 level.

In general, governments are not well equipped to intervene in private marketing activities. For example, in the case of paddy, even though government expressed the desire to purchase paddy during the peak harvesting season, the inability to store purchases and marketing problems have undermined the objectives of the exercise. Thus, it is preferable for the government to refrain from becoming involved in commercial activities. Instead, it could provide a consistent policy regime and an efficient infrastructure, and supply other essential public goods and services, which the private sector fails to supply.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka has shown a mixed performance in terms of international trade liberalisation of agriculture products. In 2002, tariff on agricultural products remained low except for a few commodities such as potatoes, chillies, onions, green gram and rice. During the year, however, several changes were made to tariffs on agricultural imports. The surcharge of 40 per cent imposed on the import duty on rice, paddy, milk powder, potatoes, red onions, big onions and chilies was removed to bring down the cost of living. Tariff structures on some of the food items were also changed to protect the local farming community. The import duty of 35 per cent on paddy and rice was changed to a specific duty of Rs. 7 per kg with effect from 21 January 2002 and further reduced to Rs 5 per kg with effect from 6 November 2002. A specific import duty of Rs. 30 per kg on chillies, Rs. 6 per kg on big onions and Rs. 5 per kg on red onions was imposed with effect from 23 March 2002. The duty on green gram and cowpea was also changed to a specific duty of Rs. 5 per kg with effect from 06 November 2002. This conversion from ad valorem duty to specific duty is to provide adequate protection to domestic farmers, minimising price risk due to seasonal fluctuation of commodity prices. This will also eliminate the possibility of underestimation of import value.",

The problems are manifested in post-harvest losses, low labour productivity, producer unrest, out-migration of labour, and volatile prices. The sector has to evolve into a self-reliant and efficient sector, since any government intervention in supporting the sustainability of the sector, which crowds out private sector activities, has failed both historically and internationally. Inadequate irrigation systems increase the vulnerability of the sector to droughts. Small and fragmented lands do not yield economies of scale, thus discouraging mechanisation and capital investment. This in turn raises costs of production and lowers international competitiveness, as well as any profit margins. Furthermore, in the absence of productivity enhancing mechanisation, the subsidy-stimulated use of fertiliser, and",

The annual average Colombo Auction price in rupee terms increased from Rs 143.96 per kg to Rs 149.30 per kg in 2002, but in US dollar terms declined by 10 per cent to US dollar 1.50 per kg. Global tea prices were not very attractive during early 2002 due to the record level of global tea output in 2001. However, production shortfalls reported in major producing countries, except in Sri Lanka, during the latter part of 2002 helped absorb the excess supply of tea. Tea export volumes recorded a slight drop during 2002 in comparison to the previous year. The total export earnings from tea in rupee terms was Rs 63.1 billion, indicating an increase of 2.4 per cent compared to the previous year. However, in US dollar terms, earnings from tea declined by 4.3 per cent. The share of bulk tea exports increased from 60 per cent to 64 per cent thereby reducing the average export price for tea. This was due to a sharp decline in exports of packeted teas. However, unit values of value added tea exports showed a significant improvement in 2002.",

The Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) has initiated a major promotional drive to find new markets for value added tea products. These include the participation in international food and beverage trade fairs, uni-national promotion of Ceylon tea through commercial divisions of Sri Lankan Missions abroad, approval of 36 brand promotion projects with the objective of strengthening and sustaining the market share of Ceylon tea brands in selected countries. South Korea, Singapore, China and Malaysia have been identified as potential new markets for value added tea exports. In addition, a special brand promotional project was implemented to support Sri Lankan exporters to promote their brands in India under the Indo Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ILFTA).

The TSHDA also implemented various subsidy schemes to encourage replanting and new planting. To enable small holders to cope with the increasing cost of cultivation, the replanting and infilling subsidy rates were revised upwards during the year. However, the subsidy scheme for tea planting with coconut was removed due to lack of funds from of the Coconut Cultivation Board. The TSHDA established 1,232 SmallHolder Development Societies as at end 2002 with a total membership of 159,377. The 'Tea Shakthi Fund', which was initiated in 1997 to provide social security to members as well as to encourage the investments in 'Tea Shakthi Projects', had a total membership of 136,349 at end 2002 with total savings of Rs 131 million. Under the Social Security Benefit Scheme, a sum of Rs 45 million has been paid to the smallholders.

    "text": "Rubber production, which reported the lowest output in 2001, improved by 5.2 per cent to a production of 91 million kg in 2002. The declining trend in output observed during the last few years reversed due to the improvement in international and local prices after April 2002. The output increase is attributed to the improvement in prices, which encouraged the tapping of some of the abandoned fields, as well as the increase in the number of tapping days on account of the dry weather that prevailed during the first half of the year. Any further increase was affected due to the rainy weather that prevailed during the latter half of the year, which reduced the number of tapping days. The average yield level also improved by 11 per cent to 724 kg per hectare after reaching the lowest level in 2001.

However, a bumper harvest in 2000 and duty waivers given to importation of edible oil until mid 2000 resulted is a sharp decline in farmgate prices thereby adversely affecting profit margins of coconut growers. This discouraged the fertiliser application and other inputs, which contributed to the poor performance in coconut production in 2002. There was a suggestion to import coconut to relieve the consumers from the burden of high prices of fresh nuts. Although importing coconuts may be a short-run solution, strategies should be adopted to increase productivity of coconut plantations for sustainable growth in the coconut industry. Such strategies should include introduction of micro irrigation systems such as drip irrigation to minimise dependence on weather and encouraging intercropping coconut with cash crops to increase farm income. Attractive farmgate prices received during 2002, coupled with the assistance given to revive the coconut sector, will encourage growers to increase fertiliser application and improve management practices. It would contribute to a recovery in coconut production in 2003, there by benefiting the coconut industry as a whole.",

    "text": "approximately 25,300 hectares. According to estimates of the Department of Export Agriculture (DEA), the cinnamon production during 2002 has declined by 4 per cent, but export volumes have increased in raw form. Both farmgate prices and export prices increased during 2002. Earnings from cinnamon in primary form amounted to Rs 4.3 billion, while earnings from cinnamon bark oil and leaf oil exports amounted to Rs 258 million. There has been a steady increase in earnings from cinnamon exports in recent years and it has become the third largest export agricultural crop, next to coconut, since 1998. There is considerable potential for Sri Lanka to increase value added exports from cinnamon and measures should be taken to gain this capability in the medium term. At present, most of the cinnamon is exported as quills in bulk form. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage the value added cinnamon industry by adopting proactive measures and creating awareness among exporters.",

The export volume of pepper increased more than two fold, to 7,900 metric tons, in 2002 compared to the previous year, earning nearly Rs 1.5 billion. More than 80 per cent of the pepper was exported to India under the Preferential Trade Agreement in 2002. However, international pepper prices were not attractive due to stiff competition among major producing countries in the global market in the wake of a decline in the pepper consumption in Europe.",

    "text": "Oil palm is gradually gaining popularity as a plantation crop, especially in the Southern Province. At present, the extent under oil palm in three Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) is approximately 3,000 ha. Oil palm cultivation has been expanding in recent years, replacing unproductive rubber lands. The low labour utilisation, low cost of replanting and a shorter gestation period compared to rubber encouraged RPCs to shift to oil palm cultivation. During 2002, local crude palm oil production amounted to about 8 million kg, while palm kernel oil production amounted to 380 metric tons. However, there is a concern among the villagers in oil palm growing areas that the cultivation of oil palm could result in depleting the water table. Scientists of RRI have indicated that water transpiration in oil palm is higher than in rubber and the rate of transpiration further increases during droughts. However, the CRI is of the view that even though the water absorption capacity is high in oil palm, its productivity is higher compared to rubber, coconut and many other crops. Further research has to be conducted for economic processing of the biomass produced by oil palm and waste generated from palm oil extraction to provide value addition to the industry.",

Licensing requirement imposed on the importation of rice in July 2000 were also removed in March 2002 and specific duty was reduced to Rs. 5.00 per kg with effect from 6 November 2002. As the paddy sector is protected through a tariff barrier, there is no need for a non-tariff barrier such as a licensing requirement. The removal of the licensing is a step in the right direction. It is expected that since the import policy is simple and transparent, the market will respond to any price fluctuations by importing as and when necessary.",

The declining trend observed in the output of most of these crops continued in 2002, with the exception of potato and soyabean. The potato output continued to increase for the fourth consecutive year owing to the heavy protection provided to potato through a high tariff on imports. The specific duty of Rs.20 per kg imposed on consumption potato imports in December 2000 continued in 2002 as well. Potato production, which improved by 19 per cent in the previous year, reported a further 53 per cent improvement during 2002. The output increased purely on account of a 55 per cent increase in the extent cultivated. The heavy protection provided to potato assures the farmers of a remunerative income, which has resulted in the cultivation of a large extent under potato at the expense of cultivating vegetables in the Nuwara Eliya and Welimada areas. As a result, the price of vegetables rose during the year due to the reduction in the supply.",

The decline in the production of up country vegetables is due to the reduction in the extent under cultivation as the lands were used for potato cultivation. Prices of many varieties of vegetables during 2002 were relatively higher than in 2001 due to supply shortages as well as high input prices such as agrochemicals, and fertiliser, and increased transport costs. During the year there was a wide fluctuation in the prices of vegetables. The annual average retail prices of low country vegetables ranged between Rs 22.00 and Rs. 43.00 per kg, while the prices of upcountry vegetables ranged between Rs. 23.00 and Rs.55.00 per kg.",

Even though demand for high value vegetables is increasing due to increased demand by super markets, the tourist industry etc., production and marketing planning should be in place to minimise price fluctuations. To generate high income in this sector, development of storage, packing houses, packing materials and transport facilities with a controlled environment, and expansion of marketing facilities such as forward purchase agreements would be needed.",

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL), milk production was estimated at 266 million litres recording a marginal increase during 2002. Domestic production of dairy milk accounts for about 42 per cent of the national milk requirement. In addition, 83 million litres of buffalo milk were produced during the year, which was mainly used for processing of curd. The price paid for milk during the year was Rs. 15.00 per litre compared to Rs. 14.56 per litre in 2001. However, the increase in the prices of coconut poonac and cattle feed during 2002 increased the cost of production significantly and adversely affected the profit margins of the dairy farmers. To support the livestock industry, maize imports were made duty free from March 2002 to bring down prices of cattle feed.",
