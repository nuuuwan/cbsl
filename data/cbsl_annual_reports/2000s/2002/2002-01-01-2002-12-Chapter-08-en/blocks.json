    "text": "The fiscal policy strategy announced in Budget 2002 was formulated with the objective of resolving three problems that have persisted. The first problem was consistently high budget deficits, a consequence of declining revenues and increasing expenditure. The overall fiscal deficit during the last ten years was on average about 9 per cent of GDP. This led to excessive borrowing from domestic sources, causing serious problems for overall macroeconomic management. The second issue was the soaring public debt and debt service payments, the result of running persistently high budget deficits and costly deficit financing. As a result, the outstanding public debt surpassed the gross domestic production of the economy, while debt service payments exceeded the total revenue collection of government. The third was the continuing financial losses incurred by state owned enterprises, caused by inefficient business and financial management practices. Against this background, Budget 2002 proposed measures to consolidate the operations in the fiscal sector. In addition, Budget 2002 emphasised the need for basic reforms to establish a growth oriented economy based on public-private partnership. The budget highlighted major constraints, which required urgently to be eased to raise active participation of the private sector in developing industrial and service oriented activities. The reforms focussed on improving good governance, freeing the economy from excessive bureaucratic controls, revitalising the rural economy, developing infrastructure, encouraging private sector participation and finally creating employment opportunities. It was expected that those measures would accelerate growth momentum, cause a revival in the economy, and lead to a rise in productivity and employment on a sustainable basis. The government was expected to play the role of a facilitator in this process. The measures introduced in Budget 2002 were expected to restore sustainability in the fiscal sector, by ensuring stability in fiscal operations in 2002 and by strengthening the process of fiscal consolidation in the medium term. Accordingly, an overall deficit of 8.5 per cent of GDP was targeted. Concomitantly, the primary deficit, which is the outcome of the impact of the current fiscal policy stance, and the current account deficit, which reflects the level of government dis-savings, were targeted to be reduced to 1.2 per cent of GDP and 3.4 per cent of GDP, respectively. The improvement in fiscal aggregates were to be achieved by increasing revenue as well as by containing total expenditure. Total revenue collection was estimated to increase to 17.5 per",

Public investment was to be streamlined based on the availability of domestic resources, the capacity for undertaking investment projects and priorities in the economy. Accordingly, rupee funded investments were limited to priority sector projects, which generate high returns. Efforts were made to absorb the maximum foreign resources available on concessional terms for other investment programmes. The total public investment programme was to be contained to 5.4 per cent of GDP in 2002. Persistently high borrowing from domestic sources was also a major concern in formulating the budget as it crowds out private sector investment, thereby hampering the long-term growth prospects in the economy. Therefore, Budget 2002 relied heavily on external financing (grants and concessional borrowing) and divestiture proceeds for financing the resource gap. These sources were estimated to provide 35 per cent of the financing requirement, while the balance was expected to be raised from domestic non-bank sources.",

The overall deficit in 2002 was 8.9 per cent of GDP, 0.4 percentage points higher than the budgeted target of 8.5 per cent of GDP although significantly lower than the deficit in 2001 of 10.8 per cent of GDP. Although notable efforts were made to consolidate fiscal operations, structural weaknesses in the fiscal sector prevented further improvements. The improvement in the overall fiscal aggregates in 2002 compared to 2001 was entirely due to the rationalisation of non-interest recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure, as revenue, remained as in the previous year. Non interest recurrent expenditure declined by 1.4 percentage points to 13.5 per cent of GDP, while capital expenditure and net lending declined by 1.3 percentage points to 4.6 per cent of GDP. Interest payments continued to rise, increasing by 0.7 percentage points to 7.4 per cent of GDP. Large scale borrowing to finance the widening deficits, contracted at high interest rates prevailing in the market in 2000 and 2001, had increased interest expenditure in recent years. In 2002, debt service payments (interest and amortisation payments) exceeded the total revenue of the government.

    "text": "flexibility in budgetary operations. However, improved monitoring of defence expenditure, better targetting mechanisms in welfare programmes, the hiring freeze on recruitment to the public service and strict control over transfers to sub-national governments and public institutions enabled significant savings in recurrent expenditure. Strict controls over the allocation of rupee funds for capital expenditure and under-utilisation of foreign funds earmarked for the public investment programme also contributed to lowering total expenditure in 2002. A cause for serious concern was the continuing decline in tax revenue collection. Despite a series of measures introduced in Budget 2002 to simplify the tax system and improve collection, tax revenue continued to decline. Tax revenue fell to 14 per cent of GDP from 14.6 in 2001. The granting of various tax concessions, delays in implementing additional revenue generating proposals, poor financial performance in some public enterprises and the tax amnesty, reduced tax revenue collection in 2002. The need to implement vigorously the fiscal consolidation process was clearly evident in the experience in 2002. In order to strengthen this process, a Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act (FMRA) was enacted towards the end of 2002. The FMRA spells out the fiscal targets to be achieved in the medium-term. The budget deficit is targeted to be reduced to 5 per cent of GDP by 2006 and outstanding government debt is targeted to be reduced to 85 per cent of GDP at the end of 2006. The debt to GDP ratio is expected to be reduced further to 60 per cent by end 2013. In the fiscal consolidation process, the government has given the highest priority to reforming the tax system by simplifying the tax structure, eliminating ad hoc tax concessions, broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration to enhance tax collection. Accordingly, four taxes, i.e., the stamp duties collected by the central government, the capital gains tax, the Advance Company Tax (ACT) and the transfer tax on non-residents were abolished. In addition, the 20 per cent surcharge on corporate taxation was abolished, while the 40 per cent surcharge on import duties was reduced to 20 per cent. The consolidation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the National Security Levy (NSL) into a single Value Added Tax (VAT) was a major tax reform in 2002. The replacement of the NSL, a cascading turnover tax, by a value added type tax was a long felt need to improve the tax system. Two new taxes, the Debits Tax on current account transactions in the banking system and the Ports and Airports Development Levy (PAL) on imports, were introduced to recoup revenue losses arising from the abolition of stamp duties. The Withholding Tax on interest and dividend incomes was made a final tax for non-corporate investors in order to broaden the income tax base. The mode of taxing interest earnings of marketable debt securities was changed to be applicable on the basis of the yield to maturity, thereby collecting the entire tax liability at the time of issue of the security in the primary market. Subsequently, a notional tax credit was granted on",

    "text": "interest income earned on secondary market transactions in government securities. This effectively reduced the rate of taxation on interest on government paper transacted in the secondary market, thereby affecting the full revenue collecting potential of this tax. The tax advantage afforded to investment in government securities also resulted in raising benchmark interest rates (call market rates), as participants in the call market sought to equate returns in the two markets. Personal income taxes were further rationalised and simplified. The number of tax slabs was reduced to three (10, 20 and 35 per cent) from the former four (10,15,25 and 35 per cent). The tax free threshold was increased from Rs. 144,000 per annum to Rs.240,000 per annum. According to Budget 2002, the medium-term policy on income taxes is to reduce the maximum tax rate for both personal and corporate taxes to 20 per cent. To begin this process, the top marginal tax rate for companies with a taxable income of less than Rs.5 million was reduced to 20 per cent. This low-tax policy is expected to ease the burden of direct taxes and encourage higher tax compliance, helping to inculcate a tax paying culture in the society. With regard to the rationalisation of tax incentives, several measures were taken to streamline existing tax incentives by limiting the use of fiscal incentives to a few targeted sectors. A new tax amnesty was introduced under the Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, to bring tax evaders into the tax net. The new Act provided a tax amnesty to persons who had not declared their income up to the end of the tax year 2001/2002. Persons who make a declaration under this Act get an amnesty from their tax liability not only on account of income taxes but also other taxes, levies, duties and any penalties relating to those taxes. This new amnesty is expected to bring high income earners and operations in the informal economy into the tax system, and thereby expand the tax base. Budget 2002 indicated the need for establishing a permanent Tariff Commission to minimise the distortionary impact of taxation on the competitiveness of local producers in international markets. The continuously declining trend in the ratio of import duties to total imports (average duty rate) was a matter for concern as it had been one of the major reasons for the falling tax/GDP ratio in the past. The ad hoc duty concessions and waivers on imports, the exemption of raw material imports and the gradual reduction in tariff rates had been identified as the main reasons for the falling average duty rate. To increase revenue, new tariff rates of 2 per cent and 10 per cent were imposed on items previously exempted from customs duties. The tax administration on liquor was simplified by unifying the excise tax liabilities under the Excise Ordinance and the Excise (Special Provisions) Act. Accordingly, the imposition and collection of excise duties on liquor were brought under the Excise Ordinance, and the Excise Department was made the sole authority responsible for administering this tax. To recoup the revenue lost due to the abolition of excise taxes collected under the Excise (Special",

    "text": "Provisions) Act, the excise tax rates on liquor were revised upward on a revenue neutral basis. The drastic changes introduced to the excise tax on cigarettes by lowering the tax liability on cigarettes with shorter lengths, enabled legal cigarette manufacturers to capture the market previously dominated by illegal products. Aerated waters were brought into the excise tax net in 2002 by the imposition of an excise tax of Rs.4 per litre. The consolidation of GST and NSL into VAT, has made it the single most important source of tax revenue. The main objectives of this tax reform were to simplify the tax system, eliminate cascading and broaden the tax base, while ensuring revenue neutrality. However, the implementation of VAT with two rate bands to replace the single rate GST regime, new exemptions, and the imposition of a lower tax rate on certain taxable commodities, could undermine the ability to achieve these expected objectives. Further, the proposal to extend VAT to the wholesale and retail sectors needs some changes to the existing tax system as these businesses are liable to turnover taxes under the provincial council tax system. The performance of value added type taxes depends closely on the existence of an efficient tax administration, an area which needs more attention, if the full potential of this tax is to be realised (See box 14). The weaknesses in the existing tax administration has been continuously highlighted in the past. Therefore, to improve efficiency, the government decided to establish a Revenue Authority, which would combine the administration of the Inland Revenue Department, the Customs Department and the Excise Department under one authority. The Inland Revenue Department took steps necessary to reform its Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) by bringing the income tax and VAT files of the largest taxpayers under one administrative unit. On the expenditure side, Budget 2002 took bold measures to rationalise current as well as capital expenditure. A Budget Monitoring Committee and a Defence Expenditure Committee were appointed to monitor closely the implementation of the budget so as to prevent any deviations from budgetary targets. The on-going peace process has enabled the government to streamline expenditure on defence services. However, a comprehensive reform package is required to design a medium-term programme to get the maximum benefit from the peace process. In addition, the suspension of recruitment to the public service, except to technical and professional grades, the introduction of a better targetting mechanism in welfare programmes such as Samurdhi and the school uniforms programmes, and restrictions on resource allocation for unclassified and unforeseen expenses, were some of the main measures implemented to curtail recurrent expenditure. The enactment of the Welfare Benefit Act would help further rationalise welfare expenditure by specifying the entry and exit criteria to and from welfare programmes. The resource allocation policy for the public investment programme and advance account operations were significantly changed to",

The budget also envisaged absorbing the maximum available foreign resources of a concessional nature. However, special attention needs to be paid to the public investment programme to ensure that the infrastructure required to maintain the growth momentum targeted in the medium-term is provided. Insufficient infrastructure, as well as dilapidated infrastructure, impede the long-term growth prospects in the economy. The government's decision to introduce a zero-based budgeting system in the public sector would help rationalise overall expenditure. This would require public sector institutions to justify resource requirements to provide services to the general public and to enable the identification of unproductive public services, which need reform or liquidation. The reforms to the public service pension scheme were a long felt need. The non-contributory and pay-as-you-go type pension scheme was to be replaced in early 2003 by a contributory pension scheme applicable to all new recruits to the public service. Studies on the existing pension scheme had pointed out that the funding requirement of the total pension liability of the existing pension scheme stood at about Rs.540 billion. Further, annual pension payments to public servants were around 2 per cent of GDP. Sri Lanka's population is ageing at a relatively fast rate. In this context, a non-contributory pension scheme would not have been sustainable in the long term and would have dampened fiscal consolidation efforts in the future. In light of these issues, a contributory pension scheme with appropriate funding on a regular basis, based on actuarial studies, would safeguard the interests of retirees while improving overall fiscal performance. Following on pension reforms, the next step would be to reform the civil service in order to provide an efficient service according to the changing demands in society. In 2002, special attention was paid to liberalising the operations of commercial public enterprises and devolving more administrative powers. This was done with the objective of improving the viability of these institutions and the quality of services provided to consumers. An automatic pricing formula was introduced for petroleum products and operations in the petroleum sector were liberalised under the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Act. In the same vein, the Electricity Reforms Act was enacted with the intention of unbundling activities in the electricity sector. The lack of a transparent and an automatically adjusting fares policy for road transportation had hampered the development of this sector. Therefore, a bus fares policy was introduced by the National Transport Commission to determine the bus fare structure in a more systematic manner. Public enterprises such as SLPA, CPC and CWE, introduced restructuring programmes on their own under which voluntary retirement schemes were introduced as an exit mechanism for excess employees. SLPA alone reported about 3,000 voluntary retirements in 2002. The Department of Civil Aviation was restructured as the Civil",

    "text": "The Value Added Tax (VAT) also referred to as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an indirect tax levied on the consumption of goods and services. VAT, as its name suggests, is a tax on the value added to goods and services at each stage of production and distribution. As VAT is a consumption tax the economic incidence of the tax, i.e., the actual payment of the tax liability is passed on to the consumer, whereas the legal incidence, i.e., the responsibility for paying the tax, falls on the producer/ supplier. Just over 50 years from its introduction, the VAT has become one of the main sources of revenue in more than 120 countries around the world.1. The preference for a value added tax over other consumption taxes has been that it is non-distortionary, because it taxes only final consumption and not intermediate transactions. Secondly, it overcomes the problem of cascading or the tax on tax effect. In a turnover tax, both the inputs into a commodity and the outputs are taxed, resulting in a tax on tax. However, under a value added tax the tax on inputs can be credited when calculating the tax on outputs, hence a tax on tax is avoided. Sri Lanka had a Turnover Tax (TT) system from 1964, covering manufacturing and non-manufacturing businesses. In 1981, new legislation extended the TT to imports and introduced an input credit scheme for manufacturers. Therefore, since 1981, under the TT System, apartial value added tax system had been in operation. However, because of the various shortcomings in the TT system, in 1990, the Taxation Commission proposed the replacement of the TT with a new value added type tax. The Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is a value added tax, was introduced to replace the TT in April 1998. Although this tax was expected to generate the same level of revenue as the TT that it replaced, its revenue performance was not satisfactory. The large number of exemptions, the less than revenue neutral rate (12.5 per cent) and the refund mechanism that operated contributed to this tax under performing in all years in which it was in operation. Although a value added type tax has been in operation \u2022: since 1998, there has been a parallel turnover based tax system that has also been operated in the form of the National Security Levy (NSL). This has resulted in the operation of multiple tax systems and the problem of a tax",

The vast exemptions afforded in the GST system has lowered the tax base and significantly eroded the revenue generating capability of the tax. A productivity estimate for value added taxes, which compares the value added tax base as a proportion to GDP (Productivity Ratio = VAT revenue as a % of GDP / VAT rate) indicates a productivity ratio of only 26 per cent. This is lower than the average productivity ratio of 30 per cent experienced in many countries (See Table 1). Such a low rate reflects the narrow base, the result of the large number of exemptions. In view of these weaknesses Budget 2002 proposed to consolidate the GST and the NSL into a single tax, namely, the Value Added Tax (VAT) with effect from August 2002.",

Tax Threshold: Anyone who has supplied taxable goods or services in excess of Rs. 500,000 per quarter or Rs.1.8 million per annum, excluding the value of supplies of wholesale or retail trade carried on as an independent activity is liable to pay VAT. At present, wholesale and retail trade have been excluded from VAT, except if the wholesale or retail trader is a manufacturer or an importer. Tax Rates: There are two VAT rates. A lower rate of 10 per cent on essential goods and services and a standard rate of 20 per cent on other goods and services. A zero rate continues to apply to exports and specified services for which payment is made in foreign currency.",

    "text": "Price Impact: An analysis of the impact of VAT on the price level using a consumer price index would indicate that although there are changes in the relative prices of certain goods that the introduction of VAT has had a favourable impact on the general price level. One of the main reasons for this was that several essential commodities, such as rice, wheat flour, pharmaceuticals etc., that form a major portion of the consumption basket that were subject to either GST or NSL or both, were exempted under VAT. Another reasons for this favourable impact was that the base of VAT on imports was the elimination of the 25 per cent mark up that was included in charging NSL at the point of imports. As a result, the effective rate of tax under VAT is less than under the GST and NSL system on imports. A comparison of the effective tax rates under the GST and NSL and under a VAT scenario is given in Table 3.",

In Sri Lanka however, the financial sector has been one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy and therefore, cannot be completely excluded from the tax base. However, most countries that have implemented VAT have exempted the financial sector because of the, difficulty of measuring the value added in financial services. Israel for instance has taxed the value added in the financial sector by the addition method, which is a tax levied on the sum of profits and wages. Sri Lanka too, has adopted this addition method in its application of VAT on financial institutions with effect from 01 January 2003. The problem with this method is that since it is not possible to identify the value added of each transaction it does not allow for any input credits, thus giving rise to cascading, if the tax liability is passed on to the borrower. The budget proposal however, explicitly indicates that financial institutions are not supposed to pass on this tax to customers. Given that the VAT is in principle a consumption tax, it is highly unlikely that financial institutions will refrain from passing this liability to their customers. Expansion of VAT to the wholesale and retail sectors: The government in Budget 2002 announced the intention to expand the VAT to the wholesale and retail sectors from July 2003. This has since been postponed due to cost of living considerations. The VAT would be in addition to the Turnover Tax (TT) on wholesale and retail trade that is currently being collected by the Provincial Councils. Therefore, the introduction of an additional tax is bound to have an adverse impact on prices. Another issue that would need to be dealt with when extending VAT to the wholesale and retail sectors would be the additional tax files that would be created. It has been estimated that the extension",

Rationalisation of exemptions and a low, uniform VAT rate: Although, in theory, all consumption items should be taxed, in practice, this has not been the case due to various political, social and administrative reasons. Therefore, the implementation of VAT in most countries has resulted in the exemption or exclusion of certain goods and services from the tax base. This has led to a serious erosion of the tax base and the need for higher tax rates to compensate for the loss of revenue. The VAT introduced in August 2002 has had to take into account the need for a high VAT rate to compensate for the loss of revenue as a result of the large number of exemptions, while taking into account equity considerations and the need for a low rate on essential commodities.

Disputes relating to the rate applicable to commodities may arise in a multiple rate system. The large number of exemptions and the narrow base makes it difficult to implement a single low rate. An analysis of the sector/commodity concentration of consumption taxes reveals that revenue collection is largely dependent on a few commodities, such as motor vehicles, petroleum products, liquor and tobacco. Broad basing the tax base, by expanding the coverage of the tax to a wider range of activities in the economy would require a rationalisation of tax exemptions and improvements in tax administration. This would not only enable the implementation of a single low rate, which will facilitate tax administration and improve tax compliance, but also increase the tax elasticity in the economy.",

    "text": "The issueof debt sustainability is often discussed in the context of Fiscal sustainability, as the government debt is the final outcome of the fiscal policy of a country. The issue of fiscal sustainability generally revolves around the question of whether the present and prospective fiscal stance is heading towards an excessive and persistent accumulation of debt levels. Hence, in order to maintain fiscal sustainability, fiscal policy should plan to stabilise the debt/ GDP ratio within a feasible range rather than allowing it to increase, to an unsustainable level. However, there is no optimal level of debt appropriate for all economies and the desired level of indebtedness would generally be both country and time specific. A high and an increasing level of debt has several implications. The government will have to pay a significant amount of its revenue receipts as interest payments on outstanding debt, which will increase the pressure on the government's ability to meet its other commitments, leaving little room for other essential and development-oriented expenditure. It also tends to reduce resource availability to the private sector in addition to increasing the interest rates in the domestic markets. This will increase the cost of borrowing by the private sector and thereby crowd out private investment, adversely affecting the economic growth of the country. High government debt would also increase the need for frequent rollover of existing debt, making fiscal management more difficult. Furthermore, it limits the maneuvering abilities of fiscal policy in responding to economic fluctuations. As such, modern day fiscal policy emphasises the need for bringing down the level of government debt to more desirable levels in the medium to long run, thereby restoring fiscal sustainability. Considering debt to be total debt, i.e. domestic and foreign government debt taken together (after adjusting the foreign debt for exchange rate variations), the determination of the debt/GDP ratio in a particular year is related to the initial debt level, the primary deficit (revenue minus expenditure, net of interest payments), the nominal interest rate on the government debt and the nominal growth rate of the economy. Accordingly, in the macroeconomic context, there are two major determinants of the sustainability of debt, i.e., the primary deficit and the difference between the nominal interest rate on government debt (i) and the nominal growth rate of the economy (g), as given in the following equation.",

    "text": "where, GDP =; Gross Domestic Product, B = total government debt, PD = primary deficit of the budget, i = nominal interest rate on government debt and g = nominal growth rate of the economy. This implies that the change in the debt/GDP ratio depends on the primary deficit, the difference between the nominal interest rate on government debt and the nominal growth rate of the economy (interest-output growth differential) and the initial debt/GDP ratio. The first term on the right hand side of this equation implies that when the nominal interest rate on government debt exceeds the nominal growth rate of the economy (i.e. i>g), interest payments add more to the outstanding debt than growth adds to the GDP, requiring a primary surplus in the budget to offset this increase. This also indicates that even if the primary deficit is zero, the debt/GDP ratio can increase because paying interest on outstanding debt increases the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio faster than economic growth increases the denominator. The primary deficit, the second term in the equation, reflects the outcome of the government's fiscal policy in the period under review. If the primary deficit is high, then the government-borrowing requirement will also be high, leading to an increase in the outstanding debt stock. An additional factor that determines the level of debt is the effect of the exchange rate variation on outstanding foreign debt. When the local currency depreciates vis-a-vis the foreign currencies in which foreign debt has been contracted, the foreign debt calculated in terms of domestic currency will increase. The magnitude of the impact will depend on the currency composition of the foreign debt and the relative depreciation of such currencies.",

    "text": "outstanding debt from 1997, a year in which the lowest debt/ GDP ratio (85.8 per cent) was recorded in the recent past, to 2002 where the debt/GDP ratio rose to 105.3 per cent. The high level of deficits and debt are the combined outcome of various factors. The slowdown in government revenue collection and the relatively high government expenditure are the major factors that affected the increase in the overall deficit. In addition, the slippage in fiscal consolidation efforts in recent years, the reduction of financial repression with increased liberalisation of financial markets and the resulting increase in the average interest rate on government borrowings and the gradual decline in external concessional loans, which had helped keep the average cost of foreign borrowing at a relatively low level, also contributed to the worsening of the fiscal position. The gradual shift in the deficit financing process towards more domestic borrowings and the consequent structural change in the outstanding debt stock (towards more domestic debt) and increased debt service payments have further aggravated the situation. As about 97 per cent of foreign loans have been obtained at highly concessional interest rates, the interest cost on foreign loans has been only about 9 per cent of total interest payments although foreign loans amount to about 45 per cent of total government debt. However, the continuous depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee, particularly against currencies in which a large portion of the outstanding foreign debt stock is denominated, such as the Japanese yen and Special Drawing Rights (SDR), has resulted in a significant expansion in the outstanding value of external debt, although net new foreign financing in the budget is very small. The average economic growth rate has also remained below the potential level in the recent past. These developments indicate that debt dynamics are likely to worsen in the future in the absence of a comprehensive and prolonged fiscal consolidation process and economic growth accelerating efforts.",

    "text": "All these efforts to achieve fiscal sustainability can be examined based on two scenarios - a 'no adjustment scenario' and a 'strong adjustment scenario'. The former assumes the continuation of the current fiscal policy with no effort to bring the fiscal variables under control. In contrast, the latter is related to the medium-term budgetary programme that the government anticipates to follow over the next few years, which includes strong adjustments in the fiscal sector. Table 1 summarises the major components of these two scenarios, while Chart 1 describes the outcome of the two scenarios in respect of overall deficit/GDP ratio, primary deficit/GDP ratio and total government debt/GDP ratio. Under the no adjustment scenario, deficit and debt levels deviate significantly from the targets set by FMRA. The overall budget deficit and debt as a percentage of GDP increase significantly to about 15 per cent and 128 per cent, respectively, by 2006. In contrast, the expected outcome of the medium term budgetary framework with strong fiscal adjustments will be consistent with the targets in FMRA. Therefore, depending on the strength of the policy adjustments, the reduction of the debt/GDP ratio will be determined. In the absence of strong policy adjustments, however, there is always a tendency that debt dynamics are likely to worsen while further increasing the required adjustment to ensure achieving fiscal sustainability. As the debt/GDP ratio is also directly related to the growth rate of the economy, strong fiscal adjustment policies should be complemented with economic growth enhancing measures in achieving fiscal sustainability and meeting the targets set out in FMRA.",

This Committee was assigned the task of monitoring the progress of foreign funded projects and streamlining systems, so as to ensure higher donor funded project utilisation rates and shorter project implementation periods.

At end 2001, government borrowing from the two state banks through overdraft facilities and unsettled import bills amounted to Rs.38 billion and Rs.12.5 billion, respectively. Recognising the need for improving the transparency in debt management, Budget 2002 proposed, as a first step in this direction, the conversion of the outstanding overdraft to marketable debt instruments such as, Treasury bills and Treasury bonds. This process will continue as it has been proposed to settle the outstanding LCs with the two state banks in 2003. In addition, borrowing through administrative arrangements was suspended and a part of the outstanding administrative debt was settled in 2002. The strict enforcement of this policy would not only improve transparency in fiscal operations, but also minimise undue pressure on institutional investors to finance the government budget.",

This reduction was entirely due to the improvement in central government operations in 2002. The improved financial performance in CPC with the adoption of an automatic pricing formula helped maintain the performance of non-financial corporations as in the previous year. Had the debt recovery adjustment charge not been removed from the pricing formula for petroleum products, there would have been a further improvement of about 0.2 per cent of GDP in the public sector deficit. However, this positive effect was largely off-set by the deterioration in the financial position of CEB, although upward revisions in electricity tariffs helped lower the debt liability by about 0.4 percentage points of GDP. CEB reported large operational deficits, as prices were not raised in line with costs. The increasing liabilities of the CEB are a matter for concern, requiring drastic changes to revive this public enterprise. The introduction of automatic pricing formulae for public enterprises, together with improvements in their operational efficiency, would be the most rational way of improving their commercial viability.",

    "text": "On the expenditure front, significant progress was made in maintaining non-interest expenditure below the 2001 level. Some of the key measures taken to limit current expenses were the streamlining of defence expenses following the cessation of hostilities, better targetting of household welfare programmes, the suspension of recruitment to the public sector, avoidance of ad hoc wage increases, strict controls on transfer payments to sub-national governments and public institutions and the rationalisation of current payments on other goods and services. Accordingly, non-interest current expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, declined to 13.5 per cent from 14.9 per cent in 2001. However, a sharp increase in interest expenditure to 7.4 per cent of GDP from 6.7 per cent of GDP in 2001, offset a part of the gains from the reduction in other recurrent outlays. Consequently, the current expenditure/GDP ratio declined only by 0.8 per cent to 20.8 per cent from 21.6 per cent in 2001. Stricter fiscal discipline and accountability are essential to achieve the targets envisaged in the FMRA, which will come into effect from 2003. Some of the key areas which can provide further reductions in current expenditure are improvements in debt management, improved targetting in welfare programmes with the implementation of the Welfare Benefits Act, reform of the civil service, restructuring of defence services in line with developments in the peace process, rationalisation of ministerial and institutional structures, improved profitability in public enterprises and the introduction of zero-based budgeting, which will avoid allocation of resources to low priority and redundant activities.",

    "text": "The public investment programme for 2002 was designed to absorb the maximum available project related concessional foreign funds, while restricting rupee funds to priority projects with high returns. Consequently, because of resource constraints, allocations for public investment in Budget 2002 were contained to 5.4 per cent of GDP, in comparison to 5.9 per cent in the previous year. However, there was a setback to the planned public investment programme in 2002. Public investment declined to 4.6 per cent of GDP, the lowest level of public investment in the last decade. As in the past, the under-utilisation of foreign funds was the main reason for the non-realisation of the annual investment target. The foreign resource utilisation ratio in 2002 was only 23 per cent, evidence of the slow progress in the utilisation of foreign resources. In addition, the 3-month delay in presenting the budget delayed the implementation of the investment programme. An adequate level of public investment is necessary to complement and stimulate private investment. Significant cutbacks in the public",

    "text": "investment programme in terms of resource allocation and the under-utilisation of existing resources would adversely affect the development and maintenance of basic infrastructure and impede the full realisation of the economy's growth potential. Hence, the allocation of more resources for the development of infrastructure is essential. The strategy should be to raise resources through a shift in the composition of expenditure without widening the budget deficit. The total financing requirement in Budget 2003 (Rs. 141.1 billion) was significantly lower than 2001 (Rs.152.2 billion) but exceeded the original target by Rs.5.7 billion. Privatisation proceeds and receipts from foreign sources recorded significant shortfalls amounting to Rs.32.7 billion. The shortfall in expected resources and the additional resources required to bridge the wider resources gap were entirely met from domestic sources. As a result, total net borrowing from domestic sources rose by Rs.38.4 billion to Rs. 126.4 billion. The privatisation programme in 2002 was able to raise only Rs.5.7 billion against the target of Rs.21 billion. The shortfall was due to the inability to finalise some transactions in 2002. The privatisation of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC), and the regional bus companies were postponed to 2003. The government was unable to sell its balance share holding in the Shell Gas Company. The volume of shares of Sri Lanka Telecom sold on the Colombo Stock Exchange was reduced from the original target. The transfer of management in the National Lotteries Board and the liberalisation and restructuring of CPC were both delayed. However, the completion of these privatisations in 2003 will reduce the domestic borrowing requirement in that year. The under-utilisation of available foreign resources has been an on-going problem. In 2002, in comparison with the annual disbursement target, the shortfall in the external financing programme amounted to Rs.17.5 billion (Rs.17 billion, loans and Rs.0.5 billion, grants). As these funds are almost entirely of a concessionary nature and directly related to the investment programme of the government, the continuation of this high rate of under-utilisation has a direct impact on future growth prospects and incurs a significant economic cost to the country. Considering the importance of resolving this issue, a committee was appointed to expedite the utilisation of foreign resources and reduce project implementation periods. The mobilisation of domestic resources to finance the deficit declined by 0.8 percentage points to 8 per cent of GDP in 2002 in comparison to 2001, easing government borrowing pressure on the domestic market. However, the accommodation of the shortfall in privatisation receipts and foreign financing, as well as the widening of the budget deficit, resulted in increasing net domestic borrowing by 2.5 per cent of GDP from the original estimate of 5.5 per cent. Despite the increase in the borrowing requirement, the government was able to maintain a market based borrowing policy and raise the entire resource requirement from the domestic market, while reducing its non-",

    "text": "the rest from income taxes. Taxes on imports increased to 46 per cent of total tax revenue in 2002 from 44 per cent in 2001, while the share of taxes on domestic goods and services declined to 37 per cent from 39 per cent in 2001. Although revenue from income taxes declined marginally to 2.4 per cent of GDP in 2002 from 2.5 per cent in 2001, the performance of the different sources of income tax was mixed. Revenue from corporate taxes declined significantly to 0.9 per cent of GDP from 1.5 per cent in 2001. Revenue from personal income taxes fell marginally to 0.8 per cent of GDP from 1.0 per cent in 2001. However, higher revenue collection from the Withholding Tax in 2002 offset the weak performance in corporate and personal income taxes, preventing a larger reduction in overall revenue from income taxes. Corporate tax collection in 2002 sharply declined by 25 per cent over 2001, due to several reasons. The removal of the 20 per cent surcharge on corporate taxes had a large impact. Further, the abolition of the Advance Company Tax (ACT) from 01 April 2002 reduced revenue by eliminating the advanced collection of taxes on the distribution of dividends, while allowing companies to set off any previous ACT paid against their current year's tax liability. Similarly, although investment tax allowances were abolished with effect from 01 April 2000, unclaimed balances that can be set off when calculating taxable income are still available to companies that have made large capital investments in the past, considerably reducing corporate tax collection from these institutions. Lower tax payments by certain key government enterprises, such as SLPA, has also significantly reduced corporate tax collection in 2002. The introduction of a lower tax rate of 20 per cent from 01 April 2002, for companies with a taxable income of less than Rs.5 million, encouraged companies to avail themselves of this lower tax rate, reducing the potential corporate tax revenue collection. The Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Act No. 7 of 2002 provided a tax amnesty to persons who had not declared their income or assets up to 31 March 2002. This amnesty, which originally covered only income taxes, was extended to cover the collection of taxes, duties, levies and penalties under 26 Acts. Under the new Act those who wished to make use of this tax amnesty were expected to make a declaration and file tax returns for the income tax year 2002/2003 by 30 June 2003. Any person who made such a declaration would enjoy full immunity from liability to any tax, levy or duty and any penalties and from any investigation or prosecution for any offence under any of the laws stated in the Act. In addition, any investigation or prosecution which was in progress would be withdrawn. Since this tax amnesty covers the current tax year (2001/2002) as well, it has had a negative impact on tax collection in 2002. However, the benefits of the tax amnesty on government tax revenue will be observed from 2003. There was a marginal decline in personal income tax collections in 2002. The increase in the tax free threshold to Rs.240, 000 from Rs. 144,000 and the upward revision of tax",

    "text": "slabs with effect from 01 April 2002 contributed to this lower tax collection. The removal of the Save the Nation Contribution in October 2001 also contributed to the lower revenue collection from personal income taxes. The Inland Revenue Department has taken active measures in the last few years to broaden the tax base by opening a large number of new tax files. This is expected to have a positive impact on tax collection in the future. Revenue from withholding taxes increased sharply in 2002, to Rs.l 1.5 billion in 2002, from Rs.2.7 billion collected in 2001. Over 75 per cent of withholding tax revenue in 2002 was on interest income from government securities. The extension of withholding taxes to government securities from 01 May 2002 and the mode of collecting this tax, contributed to this higher revenue collection. In the case of government marketable instruments, the tax is deducted upfront based on the yield to maturity of the securities at the time of issue. The issue of securities with longer maturities further increased the revenue from this tax. Revenue from taxes on consumption declined in 2002 to 11.6 per cent of GDP from 12.1 per cent in 2001. While revenue from taxes on domestic goods and services declined to 5.2 per cent of GDP in 2002 from 5.7 per cent in 2001, taxes on imports remained at the same level as in 2001 at 6.4 per cent of GDP. The consolidation of GST and NSL into VAT was intended to improve revenue collection by simplifying the tax system, removing distortions in the tax system caused by cascading taxes and broadening the tax base by reducing the number of exemptions. However, the combined revenue collected from GST, NSL and VAT in 2002 fell to 6 per cent of GDP from 6.3 per cent in 2001. Tax revenue from GST, NSL and VAT on domestic goods and services fell to 3.1 per cent of GDP in 2002 from 3.3 per cent in 2001. Although the intention was to bring all commodities that were liable to both GST and NSL under VAT at 20 per cent, and those that were liable either to GST or NSL under VAT at 10 per cent, and to exempt from VAT all commodities that were exempt from both GST and NSL, there were anomalies in the application of VAT. Some services that had hitherto been liable to NSL, such as certain financial services and hire purchase transactions were exempt from VAT. Some sectors, such as the construction industry, became liable to lower rates under VAT than under GST and NSL. Both those changes reduced revenue. The implementation of a multiple VAT structure has adversely affected revenue collection. Certain final goods and services, such as construction and leasing, are liable to VAT at 10 per cent, while inputs into those sectors are liable at 20 per cent. That has enabled suppliers to claim higher input credits on purchases than VAT payable on sales. Revenue from GST, NSL and VAT on imports remained at the same level as in 2001 at 3 per cent of GDP, although there was a significant growth in imports during the second half of 2002. The exemption of some key commodities from VAT, such as pharmaceuticals, wheat grain and crude oil, which were previously liable to NSL,",

    "text": "considerably reduced tax revenue collected on imports in 2002. Revenue collected from excise taxes grew by 16 per cent to Rs.52 billion in 2002, increasing the revenue to GDP share to 3.3 per cent from 3.2 per cent in 2001. Higher excise tax collection from petroleum products and motor vehicles mainly accounted for this increase. Revenue from excise taxes on petroleum products rose by 29 per cent to Rs.16.7 billion. The main reasons for this significant growth were the payment of excise taxes in arrears amounting to over Rs.2 billion by the CPC and the conversion of excise duties on petroleum products from an ad valorem rate of 35 per cent to a specific excise duty initially at Rs.24 per litre on petrol and Rs.4 per litre on diesel, with kerosene being exempted. Excise rates were subsequently revised in August 2002 with the introduction of the VAT, to Rs.21 per litre on petrol, Rs.3 per litre on diesel, and an excise tax of Rs.1.25 per litre on kerosene was introduced. Revenue collection from excise taxes on motor vehicles grew significantly by 66 per cent in 2002 to Rs.4.6 billion. The increase in revenue from excise taxes on motor vehicles reflected the sharp growth in motor vehicle imports in 2002. Revenue from excise taxes on cigarette sales rose by 6 per cent to Rs.20.6 billion. Although there was a downward revision in excise tax rates on cigarettes to compensate for the imposition of VAT on cigarette sales, the steady growth in sales of cigarettes liable to higher excise rates and the upward revision of excise taxes on certain brands of cigarettes during the latter part of 2002, contributed to this growth in excise tax collection. A bold policy decision to reduce excise taxes on shorter brands of cigarettes, enabling the legal industry to compete with the illegal white cigarette industry has paid off, with sales in those brands growing rapidly. This too has had a positive impact on revenue collection in 2002. In order to simplify the tax structure and facilitate administration, Budget 2002 made the Excise Department the sole collector of excise taxes on liquor by abolishing the Excise (Special Provisions) duty on liquor. Excise duty rates under the Excise Ordinance on locally manufactured hard liquor and customs duty on imported hard liquor were adjusted to ensure revenue neutrality. Growth in both soft and hard liquor production in 2002 increased excise revenue collection from liquor to Rs.10.2 billion in 2002, a growth of 4 per cent over the previous year. Although revenue from import duties grew by 8 per cent in 2002 there was a marginal reduction in its share of revenue to GDP to 1.8 per cent from 1.9 per cent in 2001. The reduction in the share was mainly on account of lower collections from the import surcharge. Total collections from the import duty surcharge fell to Rs.4.6 billion in 2002 from Rs.5.4 billion in 2001, as a consequence of the reduction in the surcharge to 20 per cent from 40 per cent with effect from 15 April 2002. Revenue from import duties (excluding the surcharge) however, grew by 14 per cent in 2002, mainly due to the strong recovery in imports during the second half of 2002.

The full impact of this measure, however, would be realised in 2003. The effective duty rate (the ratio of total duty collected excluding the import duty surcharge, to dutiable imports) however, declined to 14.7 per cent from 15.3 per cent, due to the inclusion of a large number of items that were outside the tax net at duty rates of 2 per cent and 10 per cent. The complicated structure of stamp duties collected by the central government was abolished with effect from end April 2002. Although PAL was introduced with effect from 01 May 2002 to recoup the revenue lost from the abolition of stamp duties on imports, the introduction of PAL at 1 per cent (0.75 per cent for imports into export processing industries) and various exemptions lowered the revenue yielded from this tax. The introduction of the debits tax of 0.1 per cent on debits from current accounts with effect from 01 June 2002, was intended to recoup some of the revenue lost from the abolition of the stamp duty on financial transactions. However, the revenue collected from this tax, was less than expected because of the large number of exemptions and the narrow base on which the debits tax was imposed. Consequently, the combined revenue collection in 2002 from stamp duties for the first four months and PAL and the debits tax thereafter, was lower than the revenue collected from stamp duties in 2001.",

As a percentage of GDP, non tax revenue collection rose to 2.5 per cent in 2002 from 2 per cent in 2001. The favourable performance in non tax revenue collection was mainly due to higher profit transfers from the Central Bank (Rs. 11 billion, of which Rs. 1 billion was paid in advance in 2001 to finance budgetary operations in 2001) and the collection of interest dues on on-lending by the government (Rs.l 1.5 billion). Of the total interest payments to the government CEB, accounted for the largest payment, amounting to nearly Rs.5 billion. This included interest payments rescheduled from 2001, amounting to Rs.1.5 billion. Profits and dividend transfers from public enterprises other than the Central Bank, was Rs.2.3 billion lower than budgeted, mainly due to the non payment of a special levy by SLPA (Rs.2.5 billion). A shortfall in social security contributions (Rs.1.1 billion) and lower rent collection (Rs.0.7 billion) also contributed to reducing the full potential of non tax revenue in 2002.",

The possible increase in expenditure on salaries and wages was partly arrested because of the suspension of new recruitment to all government departments and agencies, except for recruitment to certain technical and professional grades.

    "text": "Sri Lanka's achievements in social welfare have been unusually high. Despite remaining a developing country in terms of per capita income, her successes in the areas of literacy, primary school enrolment, gender equality in education, life expectancy, infant and maternal mortality, immunization and other key socio-economic indicators are on par with, or even better than, many developed countries. Sri Lanka has already achieved considerable progress on many indicators identified in the development goals set for the year 2015 in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to which Sri Lanka is a signatory. These achievements have been attributed to the welfare programmes undertaken by successive governments during more than 50 years since independence. Until the late 1970s, the benefits of such programmes were available to all citizens, in terms of free health care facilities, both preventive ahd curative, free education facilities including at tertiary level, and free food rations to all households. However, economic development in the country was not adequate to sustain these state-funded, universal welfare programmes. Budget deficits ballooned and government debt rose. Consequently, successive governments since 1976 have attempted to rationalise and target these programmes to serve the truly needy, so that their burden on the government budget can be reduced to manageable levels. While state funded health and education facilities have remained, programmes for government transfers to households, both in cash and in kind, have gone through a number of revisions in successive",

    "text": "In 1976, in an initial attempt to target welfare transfers, food rations were limited to non income tax payers. Thereafter, in 1979 a food stamp scheme was introduced based on a fixed income criterion for eligibility. By 1986, despite efforts to improve targetting, over 50 per cent (1.84 million) of households were receiving food stamp benefits'. The food stamp scheme was replaced in 1989 by the Janasaviya Programme. This Programme introduced a new approach whereby families satisfying a monthly income criterion received monthly benefits for a period of two years in two fixed components, a consumption transfer and an investment transfer. Most of the consumption transfer was expected to be spent on essential food items and the balance on savings. The entire investment transfer was expected to be compulsorily saved, providing collateral at the end of two years for a loan towards an income generating activity. However, during its five years of operation, certain shortcomings were identified. One was that families were provided with fixed benefits, irrespective of their size or their level of income. This was relatively disadvantageous to larger families with lower incomes. In a further attempt to address such shortcomings, this programme was replaced by the Samurdhi Programme in 1995. The Samurdhi Programme was expected to cover one third of the population at the bottom of the income scale. It also addressed a key shortcoming in the Janasaviya",

Its ultimate objective was to promote self-reliance by nurturing the savings habit and developing income-generating self-employment. It envisaged that beneficiaries would exit this programme once their monthly income exceeded a fixed target for a continuous period of six months or when at least one family member found employment. This would enable new entrants into poverty to join the programme and those who had overcome the poverty threshold to exit. However, in its seven years of existence, this programme too has been found to have weaknesses in : targetting, implementing and monitoring, particularly the ineffective exit process. In fact, recent statistics indicate that a significant share of non-poor families receive Samurdhi benefits, while some of the deserving poor are excluded.",

Welfare benefit schemes to improve nutrition levels and maternal and child health, as well as to help the disabled and the disadvantaged, administered mainly by the Ministries of Education, Health, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Refugees and Social Welfare, are expected to cost the government budget around Rs. 10,400 million in 2003. Under the Samurdhi Programme alone, transfer payments to households are expected to cost around another Rs. 9,000 million in 2003. At end 2002, despite efforts during the year to reduce the cost of the Samurdhi Programme, around 1.9 million households (41 per cent) continued to receive benefits under the Programme, ranging from 75 per cent in Batticaloa District to 15 percent in Colombo District (Table 3). Data from the first three rounds of the HIES had recorded that of 32.5 per cent of households receiving Samurdhi benefits, less than half (14.4 per cent) were poor households. While monthly payments to households ranged from Rs. 140 to Rs. 1,000, most households received between Rs. 250 and Rs. 700 per month. Yet, the HIES calculated the required per adult equivalent food expenditure to overcome poverty at Rs. 1,338 per month. Thus, each well intended social welfare reform has had limited success and the level of poverty has not declined materially in the country, although budget deficits and government debt have risen to untenable levels.",

    "text": "WBA provides for transparency and accountability not only on the part of the applicant who seeks benefits, but also on the part of officials who sanction those benefits. The second important difference is that the WBA ensures an exit mechanism from all other public assistance schemes in effect for any applicant who has been recognised as being eligible for benefits and has been so informed under the WBA. Also, since the scheme impacts directly on the government budget, unlike in previous state-sponsored welfare programmes, it will come directly under the purview of the Ministry of Finance, so that the implications of the totality of welfare expenditure on the government budget could be regularly reviewed, analysed and addressed. These key differences are expected to minimise leakages that have been endemic under previous programmes for a variety of reasons.",

The WBA also provides for an application process for selection of beneficiaries by Selection Committees and a process of appeal and redress through Appeals Committees, while eligibility of beneficiaries is to be reviewed annually. Following its enactment, a Steering Committee on Social Welfare Reforms was appointed at end 2002 to develop a plan of action to bring the WBA into operation and implement a new Welfare Benefits Scheme under the WBA. The Steering Committee includes key policy makers and planners from the Ministry of Finance, Samurdhi Authority and the Ministry of Social Welfare, as well as technical and statistical expertise. It is anticipated that the new scheme will introduce the required checks and balances to address shortcomings identified in the existing schemes under one all-encompassing and transparent welfare relief programme, so that government transfers currently going to less needy households could be re-channeled to support the truly deserving at manageable levels for the government budget, with accountability and responsibility built into the conceptual framework to provide a meaningful social safety net.",

This scheme was withdrawn and a fixed subsidy scheme was introduced from October 2002. Under the new scheme domestic prices were allowed to change according to the cost of imports. With this reform the cost of the fertiliser subsidy was maintained below the previous year's level. The distribution of school uniforms was targeted to benefit the most needy groups in society. Other welfare transfers to households, which include expenditure on textbooks and season tickets for travel, were maintained at budgeted levels by adopting strict monitoring mechanisms. Further, the cessation of hostilities in the North and the East helped maintain payments to disabled soldiers and dry rations to refugees at the targeted levels. Transfers to public corporations and public institutions increased significantly in 2002. Large operational losses were incurred by the Regional Transport Companies (Rs.2.2 billion), Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) (Rs.2.8 billion) and the Department of Posts (Rs.l billion). The non- adjustment of prices according to changes in costs (inclusive of the salary increases), as well as management inefficiencies, resulted in higher transfers to public corporations. Wage increases granted in recent years have increased transfers to public institutions. Continuing operational losses in public corporations are not sustainable, as they will exacerbate the fiscal deficit. The losses being met from the government budget places an undue burden on taxpayers who do not consume those services. Restructuring loss making institutions so that prices take into account the operational costs, while minimising inefficiency, are essential to make them financially viable.",

    "text": "The public investment programme of 5.4 per cent of GDP in Budget 2002 was the lowest planned investment programme in recent years. Given the domestic resource constraints and the past experience of using these scarce resources for non-priority capital expenses, Budget 2002 adopted a strict policy in allocating domestic funds for the public investment programme with more emphasis given to absorbing concessional foreign funds. However, only 85 per cent of the resources allocated were utilised and the realised public investment programme was limited to 4.6 per cent of GDP compared to 5.9 per cent of GDP in 2001. Low foreign resource utilisation mainly contributed to the non-realisation of the envisaged targets, while strict controls on rupee funded projects due to resource constraints, and the delay in presenting Budget 2002, also contributed to reduce the public investment programme in 2002. The expenditure incurred by central government ministries and departments for the acquisition and maintenance of fixed assets in 2002 decreased in nominal terms by 27 per cent over the previous year.

    "text": "decreased to 1.7 per cent in 2002 from 2.6 per cent in the previous year. In particular, strict controls adopted to contain non-priority rupee funded projects and the purchase of vehicles and other equipment, helped restrict expenditure on capital assets. Total capital transfers to public corporations were significantly higher than the budgetary provisions due to additional transfer of funds from supplementary capital account votes. Actual capital transfers increased by Rs.6 billion over the budgetary target of Rs.26 billion. Transfers to institutions such as the Road Development Authority (RDA), and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) mainly contributed to this increase. Major investment programmes undertaken by the RDA were the Colombo-Katunayake expressway, the balance work in the second stage of the Baseline Road Project and the Road Network Improvement Project, while Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects were carried out by NWSDB in 2002. The on-lending programme, which provides foreign funds to commercially oriented public enterprises, was maintained at the budgeted level of 0.9 per cent of GDP. This was a marginal decline from the previous year, where on-lending amounted to 1 per cent of GDP. CEB, which uses more than half of the on-lent funds and institutions such as CPC and SLT who receive sizeable amounts under the on-lending programme, were able to carry out most of their projects for 2002. However, SLPA's utilisation rate was about 50 per cent. The persistent low utilisation of foreign funds is a major concern and is an area that should be urgently addressed. Delays in procurement procedures and processes and various administrative delays are some of the major factors influencing the slow disbursement of funds and steps should be taken to resolve these issues, as the lack of sufficient infrastructure would undermine the government's pledge to rejuvenate the economy. On a functional basis, investment under economic services accounted for 72 per cent of total public investment. Investment in economic services in nominal terms declined to Rs.51.7 billion in 2002 from Rs.54.9 billion in 2001. As a percentage of the GDP it declined to 3.3 per cent from 3.9 per cent in 2001, due to the limitations of funds from domestic sources. However, in addition to the planned investment programme, new investment was allowed through the supplementary capital vote by the Treasury to accommodate priority projects, as well as to absorb foreign concessional funds. As a result NWSDB, RDA and CEB received funds through this vote. Of the total public investment in economic services, CEB (Rs.8.6 billion), NWSDB (Rs.9.9 billion), Mahaweli Development Authority (MDA) (Rs.2.6 billion) and RDA (Rs.9.9 billion) accounted for the major portion of investments, although, investment in SLPA and SLR were below the original targeted levels. Public investment in social services was maintained at 1 per cent of GDP in 2002 as in 2001. However, these investments were only about three fourths of the targeted level for 2002. In comparison to the annual investment plan, lower levels of realisation were observed mainly in the health and",

The slowdown in economic activity, which led to slow growth in property transactions, influenced the decline in stamp duty collection.

Capital expenditure of PCs increased by 12 per cent in 2002. The increase in special foreign funded projects in the irrigated agricultural sector, restoration and rehabilitation of the North and the East and road development in the Southern Province boosted provincial capital expenditure in 2002. However, investment under the Province Specific Development Projects was lower than envisaged, due to the partial release of the Province Specific Development Grant (PSDG). Resource constraints faced by the central government mainly contributed to this decline. Investment in health and education almost reached the targeted levels for the year.

Transfers through block grants, which are used to meet the shortfall in provincial level current expenditure (81 per cent of the total transfers), increased by 23 per cent over the previous year. However, the amount released was Rs.0.8 billion less than budgeted and this was partly offset by increased revenue collected by PCs over the budget targets. The PSDG which was introduced in 2000 for regional development projects identified by PCs, accounted for about 10 per cent of the total transfers and amounted to Rs.3.9 billion. The balance constituted criteria based grants, which finance devolved activities of a capital nature, and matching grants, which is an incentive for efforts made by PCs to enhance revenue collection. Criteria and matching grants were mainly utilised for the acquisition of fixed assets and the rehabilitation and improvement of capital assets.",

    "text": "The government has clearly stated that its goal is to completely move out of all commercial activity that can be more efficiently carried on by the private sector and to address inefficient operations of public enterprises through comprehensive restructuring programmes. In order to achieve these objectives the government reiterated its commitment to the privatisation process, the restructuring of inefficient public enterprises and the liquidation of redundant public enterprises. The public enterprise reform programme in 2002 was therefore, designed to increase private sector activity in several strategic sectors in the economy. This was to be achieved by the divestiture of the government's equity stake in several public enterprises and the liberalisation of sectors that had previously been the monopoly of the state. Several public enterprises were also scheduled to be restructured during 2002. Due to lack of investor interest and various administrative delays, the privatisation of several key institutions was not concluded in 2002. The privatisation programme was confined in 2002 to the divestiture of the government's balance shareholding in several previously privatised public enterprises. Consequently, although the budget envisaged the receipt of privatisation proceeds amounting to Rs.21 billion, actual receipts in 2002 were Rs.5.7 billion.",

The divestiture of the government's shareholding in Sri Lanka Telecom, (SLT) (39 per cent) had been postponed for several years because of depressed market conditions that prevailed both internationally and locally. However, in 2002, the government was able to divest 12 per cent of its stake in SLT (Rs.3.2 billion) through an offer for sale on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Foreign investors subscribed to 16 per cent of the share issue, while the balance was taken up by domestic retail investors and state and private institutions. The government was looking to divest a larger portion of its shares in the local market (15 per cent) and based on the success of this offer, to go for either an international offer or a private placement of the remaining shares. However, the relatively low level of interest shown by local and foreign investors to the domestic offer prevented them from doing either.",

The government announced in Budget 2002 its policy to liberalise the petroleum sector to make it more competitive and efficient. The introduction of an automatic pricing formula for petroleum products at the beginning of 2002 was intended to ensure that the prices of petroleum products reflected market developments, to improve the commercial viability of the industry. The government divested its holdings in Lanka Marine Services (Rs.1.2 billion), a fully owned subsidiary of CPC, engaged in providing bunkering services. The enactment of the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Act No. 33 of 2002, was the most significant step taken in 2002 to increase private sector participation in the sector. This legislation provided for the liberalisation of the import and sale of petroleum products and the unbundling of services provided by CPC. This paved the way for the entry of multiple players into the sector. As part of the reforms in the energy sector, the government enacted the Electricity Reform Act No. 28 of 2002. This legislation sought to reorganise the CEB by unbundling its activities. The monopoly possessed by CEB over power generation and distribution will thus be removed, allowing outside entrants to this sector. The transmission function will, however, continue to be carried out by CEB. There has been a long felt need for major reforms in the public transport sector. In 2002, the government introduced a bus fares policy, by which bus fares were permitted to be revised annually according to a pricing formula, enabling bus fares to follow changes in costs more closely. The government proposed a private-public partnership in the Regional Bus Companies to improve efficiency and service. The prospective investor was expected to invest in 39 per cent of the equity of the companies and to takeover their management. An offer was made for 6 regional bus companies. However, the transaction was yet to be concluded at the end of the year. Towards the end of 2002, the government called for expressions of interest in the other Regional Bus Companies. The government has identified several public enterprises that needed to be restructured. The preparatory work in relation to the restructuring of some of these institutions was initiated in 2002, while some public enterprises, such as SLPA, CPC and CWE have already commenced the restructuring process, initiating voluntary retirement schemes in 2002. The government has also instituted a programme to reform the two state banks. The most recent reforms in public enterprises, particularly those that are engaged in the provision of public utility services, highlights the need for a strong regulatory framework to ensure that the welfare of consumers is protected. PUC and CAA were set up with the objectives of protecting the interests of consumers, promoting competition, preventing unfair trade practices, ensuring the safety and quality of goods and services and ensuring that consumers have adequate access to goods and",

In contrast to the original estimates, there was a shortfall of Rs.32.7 billion in net foreign financing (grants and concessional borrowings) and privatisation proceeds. As in previous years, this shortfall was raised entirely from domestic sources. The total amount of resources raised from the domestic sector in 2002 amounted to Rs. 126.4 billion (8 per cent of GDP) in comparison to the original target of Rs.88 billion (5.5 per cent of GDP).

    "text": "On the financing front, there were some favourable developments in 2002. First, debt dependency, which is measured as the ratio of total net borrowing relative to the total expenditure of the government, declined significantly. The minimum debt dependency ratio recorded in the recent past was in 1997 (17 per cent). Since then, it increased sharply, to 36 per cent in 2001. Restraint on the resource gap saw a reduction in the debt dependency to 32 per cent in 2002. Second, the liquidity situation in the market and the reduction in the Central Bank's policy rates by 225 basis points in 2002, significantly reduced interest rates on government securities. The raising of resources from SLDBs further reduced the pressure on domestic interest rates. Third, there was increased reliance on market oriented debt instruments in keeping with the debt management strategy. Finally, repayments to the domestic banking system lessened the crowding out of private sector investment, and prevented expansionary pressure on money growth. Despite these positive developments, the continuing high level of under utilisation of concessional foreign resources is a cause for deep concern.",

    "text": "half of 2002. The expansionary impact of the Central Bank's purchases of Treasury bills, however, was negated through the sale of Treasury bills in the secondary market. Overall, the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills declined by Rs.17 billion to Rs.40 billion at end 2002. Investments in Treasury bills by commercial banks increased considerably. The yield rates of Treasury bills began to decline in 2002, in line with other market interest rates. The result was that a cash surplus of Rs.2.9 billion, was generated on re-issues of Treasury bills, as the maturing Treasury bills were reissued at relatively lower interest rates. Therefore, on a book value basis, the total cash shortfall was marginal, as the cash surplus from re-issues and the book value of new issues amounted to Rs.39.8 billion in comparison to the face value of net new issues of Rs.40 billion. Market interest rates on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds declined significantly towards end 2002. The weighted average (without withholding tax) yield rate for 364-day Treasury bills declined to 11.01 per cent at year end from the highest rate of 15.81 per cent that prevailed during the middle of the year. As an indicative rate for all maturities, the weighted average (without withholding tax) yield rate on 4-year Treasury bonds, declined to 12.05 per cent at end 2002 from the highest rate of 15.83 per cent in the second quarter of the year. Improved liquidity in the market, particularly during the second half of the year, and the reduction of Central Bank's policy rates (i.e., Repo and Reverse Repo rates) by a total of 225 basis points in 2002, largely contributed to the decline in market interest rates. This was further supported by the injection of rupee liquidity to the market as the Central Bank purchased the foreign currency proceeds obtained by the government through the issue of SLDBs in the middle of the year. A high level of over subscription (more than twofold the total amount offered), at the Treasury bill and Treasury bond auctions almost throughout the year, provided an additional indicator of liquidity. In addition, frequent review of developments in the government securities market, the close monitoring of progress in the government borrowing programme and considerable improvements in cash management by the General Treasury, prevented ad hoc issues of government securities and helped maintain stability in interest rates in government debt securities. The declining interest rate scenario enhanced flexibility in debt management decision-making, especially expanding the choices in selecting debt instruments for budgetary financing in 2002. The government issued the balance SLDBs amounting to US dollar 91.5 million (Rs.8.8 billion) in June 2002. Unlike in previous issues in 2001, where the margin over the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was fixed in advance, investors were given the opportunity to bid in this issue, subject to a maximum of 200 basis points over the 6-month LIBOR and to decide the tenor, subject to a minimum of two years. There was no early retirement facility for this issue. As in the previous issues, subscribers for the entire issue were domestic commercial banks in contrast to the expectation of attracting foreign investors. The weighted average interest rate of the",

Government liabilities to the banking system in 2002 declined by Rs.4.8 billion as against a targeted reduction of Rs.19.5 billion envisioned in the budget. This, however, was a significant improvement in the budgetary financing process compared to the continuously high bank borrowing of Rs.27.3 billion in 1999, Rs.56.5 billion in 2000 and Rs.48.6 billion in 2001. Availability of funds from domestic non-bank sources was the main reason for this improvement. The reduction in net credit to the government was the net effect of a repayment of Rs.13.3 billion to the Central Bank and net borrowing of Rs.8.4 billion from commercial banks. Although there was a marginal increase in provisional advances to the government by the Central Bank (Rs.0.9 billion) and an increase in the utilisation of government deposits with the Central Bank (Rs.4.1 billion), the decline in the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills (Rs.16.8 billion) and Treasury bonds (Rs.1.5 billion) resulted in a net reduction of government liabilities to the Central Bank. The increase in net borrowing (Rs.8.4 billion) from commercial banks was the combined outcome of several factors. The government's outstanding overdraft with the two state banks decreased by Rs.34.5 billion. Investments in Treasury bills (Rs.16.2 billion), Treasury bonds (Rs.13.8 billion) and SLDB (Rs.8.8 billion) by commercial banks increased. However, the value of government import bills payable to the domestic units of commercial banks, which rose sharply in 2000 and 2001, remained at almost the same level in 2002. This was achieved due to the cessation of hostilities that prevailed throughout 2002, resulting in lower defence related imports. Further, in Budget 2003 it had been decided to repay the existing import bills without delay in order to reduce the high interest cost associated with them. There was a repayment of administrative borrowings in 2002 amounting to Rs.0.8 billion, in comparison to administrative borrowings of Rs.0.7 billion in 2001 and Rs.3.2 billion in 2000 for budgetary financing purposes.",

    "text": "Treasury bills, amounting to Rs.211 billion, continued to be the major instrument in the short-term domestic debt stock and accounted for 22 per cent of the total domestic debt stock. During the year, there was a significant increase in the outstanding stock of Treasury bills (Rs.40 billion), mainly due to the conversion of the outstanding government overdraft to government debt securities. Meanwhile, the outstanding amount of provisional advances given to the government by the Central Bank amounted to Rs.31 billion. This was an increase of Rs.0.9 billion. The legal provisions under the Monetary Law Act (MLA) stipulate that the increase in advances to the government by the Central Bank for a given year should not exceed 10 per cent of the estimated revenue for the same year. Currently, these advances are provided free of interest. During 2002, the government's outstanding liabilities to the banking system decreased by 3 per cent to Rs.248 billion. This accounted for 26 per cent of the total domestic debt stock, in comparison to 31 per cent held by the banking system in 2001. This reflected the decreased reliance on bank borrowings for budgetary financing. This was a commendable achievement. The decrease was mainly driven by an 18 per cent decrease in government liabilities to the Central Bank. The Central Bank was extensively involved in secondary market operations, in order to absorb excess liquidity in the market. As a result, a significant amount of its holdings of government paper was unloaded in the market. In contrast, the government's liability to commercial banks increased moderately by 5 per cent to Rs.171.9 billion in 2002. However, their share as a percentage of total domestic debt stock decreased to 18 per cent, as the growth of borrowing from other sources was relatively higher. The change in liabilities to commercial banks was mainly a combined outcome of increased holding of Treasury bills (Rs.28.9 billion), Treasury bonds (Rs.35.5 billion) and SLDBs (Rs.24.2 billion) and a reduction of overdrafts from the two state banks to Rs.4 billion from Rs.38 billion at end 2001. Total outstanding non-instrument debt of commercial banks decreased to Rs.54 billion in 2002 from Rs. 100 billion in 2001. Of this, FCBU borrowings amounted to Rs.30 billion (55 per cent) and import bills amounted to Rs. 13 billion (24 per cent), respectively.",

This was followed by IDA and ADB, the major multilateral donors, accounting for 24 per cent and 23 per cent of the total foreign debt stock, respectively. Meanwhile, the amount of outstanding non-concessional loans decreased to 3 per cent of the total external debt, mainly because of the gradual reduction in defence related loans. Project loans, from bilateral and multilateral sources, dominated the total foreign debt portfolio, accounting for 89 per cent of the total stock of foreign debt. The cumulative increase in the foreign debt stock due to the exchange rate depreciation during last 6 years which amounted to Rs.251 billion, was about 35 per cent of the total outstanding foreign debt stock at end 2002 and about 15.8 per cent of GDP in 2002. The value of the rupee against the US dollar depreciated at a lower rate (3.7 per cent) in 2002 than in previous years. However, as the amount of government foreign debt denominated in US dollars was only 16 per cent, the net impact on the debt liability was relatively less significant. In contrast, there was a sharp increase in liabilities due to the significant appreciation of cross currency exchange rates of currencies such as the Japanese yen and SDR. As the amount of foreign debt denominated in Japanese yen and the SDR was 72 per cent (31 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively), the higher rate of depreciation of the rupee against these two currencies (by 13.3 per cent and 10.8 per cent, respectively) increased the rupee liability of foreign debt significantly in 2002.",

    "text": "Governments borrow to pay for expenditure, when revenue and grants are not sufficient. Borrowing is usually based on marketable debt securities, which also help develop the debt market. Thus, some governments, even with budget surpluses, continue to borrow to provide an impetus to the debt market, in view of the economic benefits arising from well developed debt markets. When governments borrow, they need to ensure that they borrow at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long run, consistent with a prudent degree of risk. Prudent risk management to avoid dangerous debt structures and strategies is crucial, given the severe macroeconomic consequences of sovereign debt default, and the magnitude of the ensuing output losses. These costs include business and banking insolvencies, as well as diminished long-term credibility and ability of the government to mobilise domestic and foreign savings. Different countries use different strategies in raising and managing debt. The two fundamental pillars of sound debt raising and management are the legal framework and the institutional set up. The legal framework should clearly specify several important features relating to the raising and managing of debt, such as the reasons and circumstances under which the debt is raised, person(s) authorised to raise debt, person(s) authorised to manage the debt, definition of 'management', and reports on performance. The institutional set up differs from country to country. Differences arise fromthe location of the debt management office, the scope of work, degree of autonomy and accountability, governance principles, management structures and reporting lines. In some countries the debt management office acts as an internal bank of the government that manages both the government's cash and its debt. While the revenue authority collects revenue, the debt office manages the revenue, and disburses funds as per instructions given by the Treasury. The practice with regard to the location of the debt office also varies from country to country. Frequently, debt offices are found located in the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank or as a separate entity. Irrespective of the location of the debt office, it should clearly exhibit attributes of efficient debt management.",

As suggested by various authors the international best practice is to establish an independent debt office accountable to Parliament through the Minister of Finance. Table 1 illustrates relative merits and demerits of alternative institutional structures. The defining characteristic of a separate debt office is that of a specialised institution established by statute, with clearly defined responsibilities and separate from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. By being separate from the Central Bank, it would ensure that debt policy is not subordinated to monetary policy and by being separate from the Ministry of Finance, it would ensure that debt policy is not connected with short-term political considerations. The relationship between the various institutions involved in debt policy and the management process would take the following form. The debt office would make proposals to the government on debt policy, strategy and guidelines. The government will decide on the appropriate debt policy, in consultation with the Central Bank.
