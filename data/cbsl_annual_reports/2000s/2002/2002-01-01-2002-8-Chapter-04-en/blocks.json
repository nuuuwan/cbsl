This amendment helped manufacturers to employ female labour for long-overtime hours without violating labour laws.

The government also brought down the surcharge on import duty from 40 per cent to 20 per cent with effect from 15 April 2002, which reduced costs of imported raw materials.",

The international prices of textile and apparel exported from Sri Lanka declined by 6.0 per cent in 2002. Declining prices came at a time when local costs increased sharply driven by increases in energy, telephone and other utility prices, causing further difficulties. This has increased not only the factory processing cost, but also the cost of local raw materials such as polythene bags, thread, cartons and other packing materials. In order to face this unfavourable market environment, a few apparel manufacturers reduced their scale of operations and restructured their factories. Excess employees in these factories were granted temporary leave, on a half-day basis, with the approval of the Commissioner of Labour. A few factories that faced financial problems negotiated with their bankers to re-schedule existing loans and obtain new loans for factory modernisation.",

The quota system has benefited developing countries by guaranteeing a ready market and protection from competition. Its removal will increase competition and will favour countries with lower costs of production and efficient infrastructure. With the loss of quota protection, it is expected that several small-scale manufacturers will lose market share to their more efficient large-scale manufacturers. However, the removal of the quota system will also provide opportunities for efficient and dynamic manufacturers to enhance their export volumes, as this will remove quantity restrictions.",

Therefore, the loss of exports following the abolition of the quota system may not be as high as many argue. In the extreme case, even if it is assumed that all small-scale garment industries and 50 per cent of medium scale industries face problems after 2005, the total loss of exports due to dismantling of quota would be only 17 per cent. On the same basis, loss of employment after phasing out of quotas is estimated to be 20 per cent. However, actual loss of exports and employment would be lower than this, because most of the small and medium scale industries may engage in sub-contracting for large-scale industries with their existing machines and expertise. Similarly, large-scale industries may absorb the larger portion of job losers, as these industries can increase production volume a quota free trading environment.",

Some research findings suggest that the real wages in China will remain low during the next two decades due to the massive supply of labour. Even before 2001, China was not discriminated against by other WTO members as it enjoyed Most Favoured Nation status from major countries such as USA. Therefore, China's accession to the WTO will not increase Chinese exports significantly in the short run as China has already been holding a higher market share in these markets without WTO membership. The accession of China to WTO would also provide opportunities for other countries to access the massive Chinese market as Chinese trading activities are",

It would also help streamline the manufacturing process and product development. \u2022 Establishment of business links with international fashion designers and obtaining feedback from buyers on sourcing strategies would be vital to meet rapidly changing designs in the international markets. In this regard, improvement of information technology is essential in responding quickly to the changes in the markets. \u2022 The selling price of apparel items is estimated to be significantly higher than the manufacturing cost and a substantial proportion of the price goes to middlemen as commissions and for other charges for logistic services. The marketing chain involves several layers of middlemen before goods move from the manufacturer to the final consumer: manufacturer, wholesaler, semi whole-saler, exporter, trading houses, retailers and so on. It is estimated that in the domestic market, the final consumer price is 80-100 per cent higher than the factory gate price, whereas in the international market, the mark up price is 200 -300 per cent higher than the factorygate price. Therefore, manufacturers should pay more attention to building up close links with final links in marketing chain, to get higher prices for their products. \u2022 Growing preferential trade in the international market is becoming a severe threat to small middle income countries like Sri Lanka. To face this challenge, the government should take initiatives by strong lobbying for preferential trade concessions from major markets such as USA and EU countries, forming regional trading blocks and entering into bilateral trade agreements with identified countries. Lobbying and negotiating skills would play a vital role in obtaining better terms and conditions in trade agreements. In this regard, the government has already taken several measures to remove quota restrictions in the EU market and has initiated discussions to obtain preferential treatment from the US market.",

Imports of furniture from Europe and East Asian countries also affected the local furniture manufacturing industry. The local wood and wood product industry continued to face problems relating to inadequate supply and high price of raw materials and scarcity of skilled labour. However, the techniques in the industry are improving gradually with the use of modern machines in place of manual tools. Improvements were also seen in the chemical treatment of wood for durability and the painting of furniture.

The difficult market environment that prevailed, especially in the first half of the year, encouraged manufacturers to bring down labour costs through out sourcing of non-economic production activities, reducing overtime bills and even reducing excess labour by offering voluntary retirement schemes in few cases. In certain instances, companies recruited school leavers and unemployed graduates as apprentices at low salaries for short periods. Given the stringent labour laws, some manufacturers opted for recruiting more temporary and casual labour, which helped contain the total wage bill.

In order to encourage both domestic and foreign investment to the industrial sector and strengthen regional industrialisation, the government offered a series of incentives, while creating an environment conducive to investment. In addition, the government offered a wide range of incentives to industrialists to encourage them to acquire modern and sophisticated technology in production processes to raise productivity and improve competitiveness. Even after continuation of an export-oriented industrialisation strategy during the last 25 years and provision of various fiscal incentives, the industrial base is narrowly concentrated on a few products, particularly apparel. A diversification of the industrial base on a priority basis is required to face the immediate challenges that will emerge with the end of the Multi-Fibre Agreement in 2005 and to expand the current level of industrial output and employment in the future. It is also important to develop both economic and social infrastructure facilities to international standards to attract foreign investment to upgrade and diversify the industrial base. In the meantime, domestic investment in the industry should also be vigorously encouraged by restricting excessive domestic borrowing by the government, which raises interest rates and crowds out private sector investment, thereby increasing the cost of production and reducing the external competitiveness of domestic manufacturers. It is vital that all provisions in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act enacted in 2002 are strictly followed without slippage to ensure that the government fiscal deficits do not exceed the statutory limit.",

It was proposed in Budget 2002 to set up a permanent Tariff Commission to examine and remove anomalies and distortions in the prevailing tariff structure to enhance international competitiveness of Sri Lankan products. As ad hoc changes to the import tariff structure adversely affect the investment and production decisions of the investors, it is crucial that this Commission brings out a clear-cut tariff structure after effective deliberations with industrialists. The tariff regime should be transparent and reveal the future direction of tariff reforms clearly, so that the investors can make well-informed decisions. In order to increase local value addition in the industrial sector and promote backward linkages in the economy, the tariff policy should encourage vertical integration in the industrial sector, rather than encourage industrialists to produce final products with imported raw materials.",

One such programme was to develop a Techno Park to promote IT related industry, which is considered to be a driving force in the economy in the future. JICA undertook a follow-up study in early 2002 to work out an operational plan for the implementation of the Techno Park in the Greater Colombo Area. The final report of the follow-up study was submitted to the government in March 2002. This report recommended setting up the Techno Park on 158 acres of land at Diyagama in the Homagama electorate. The park will consist of a cluster of IT service industries and electronic/electrical industries, all with close linkages to academic and research institutions.",

In some instances, foreign buyers diverted their purchasing orders to manufacturers in other countries. To overcome this legally stipulated barrier, the government in 2002 amended the Factories Ordinance Act of 1942 (FOA) to permit a female employee to work 60 hours as overtime per month (per annum 720 hours) compared with 100 hours of overtime per annum permitted earlier. Further, in 2002, the government also took steps toward amending the Termination of Employment of Workmen Act No. 45 of 1971 (TEWA), the Industrial Disputes Act of 1950 (IDA) and the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act of 1956 (EWYCA) to make in the labour market more flexible and meet the demand coming from changing market conditions.",

A special fiscal incentive package was announced in Budget 2003 for enterprises approved under the new BOI Act, based on regional location. For this purpose, the whole island is classified into two regions - the Western region as Region I and all other regions as Region II. Accordingly, an enterprise in Region I, engaged in the manufacture and export of goods (non-traditional) that has a minimum investment of US dollar 150,000 and exports a minimum of 80 per cent of output will be eligible for a 3 year tax holiday, a concessionary tax rate of 10 per cent for the following two years and 15 per cent tax from the sixth year onwards. In contrast, an enterprise in Region II will be eligible for a 5 year tax holiday, a concessionary tax rate of 10 per cent for the following two years and 15 per cent tax from the eighth year onwards. The expansion of existing undertakings within Region I, with a minimum investment of Rs.100 million or relocation to Region II with a minimum investment of Rs.50 million, will be eligible for a 2 year tax holiday, provided that the investment is fully made before 31 March 2004. Enterprises engaged in industrial tool and machinery manufacturing in Region I, with a minimum investment of US dollars 150,000, will be eligible for a 3 year tax holiday, while similar enterprises in Region II will be eligible for a 5 year tax holiday. In all cases, the tax holiday period will commence from the year of commencement of commercial operations. Similarly, rehabilitated non-performing or under performing industries in Region I and II will be eligible for a 3 year tax holiday and a 15 or 20 per cent tax rate from the fourth year onwards, depending on the activity subject, to the completion of the investment before 31 March 2004.",
