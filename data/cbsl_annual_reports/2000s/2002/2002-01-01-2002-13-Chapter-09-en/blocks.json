    "text": "In 2002, the external sector was subject to both global and domestic developments that entailed favourable as well as unfavourable repercussions on the economy. Recovery in the global economy, after significant weakening in the previous year, remained slow. World output grew by 3.0 per cent in 2002. The economies of the US and the Euro area, Sri Lanka's major export markets, grew at 2.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively. As a result, external demand for goods produced in developing countries grew only moderately, at 6.3 per cent in 2002, recording an acceleration against a growth rate of 3 per cent in 2001, but still below the rate of 15 per cent achieved in 2000. Uncertainty prevailing in the Middle East, and disruptions to oil production in Venezuela, the third largest oil exporter in the world, raised oil prices and reduced the demand for developing country exports in general. However, the unfavourable effects on Sri Lanka's external sector arising from these developments were mitigated to a large extent by the peace initiative commenced by the government by signing a memorandum of understanding with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) in early 2002, and the macroeconomic policy adjustments undertaken by the government including reforms agreed under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",

International trade remained broadly flat with a drop in exports by 2.4 per cent and a rise in imports by 2.2 per cent. The trade deficit increased from 7.4 per cent of GDP in 2001 to 8.5 per cent in 2002. The drop in exports was mainly in textiles and garments (4.7 per cent) and tea exports (4.3 per cent). It was partially off set by increases in exports of other agricultural products, processed diamonds and other industrial products. The drop in garments exports reflected Sri Lanka's heavy dependence on the US and European Union markets for these exports. They account for about 63 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, of Sri Lanka's garments exports.",

Some small firms may merge with large ones and some may adopt new technology to enable firms to move up market.

The time is also ripe for Sri Lanka to focus more on the services sector, particularly at a time when the government is targeting a sustainable high economic growth of over 7 per cent in the medium term.

Meanwhile, the continued decrease in global interest rates reduced interest payments on external debt and reduced the deficit on income account. Net current transfers, which reflected only a moderate growth during the first half of the year, increased by 12 per cent in 2002 with a significant increase in private transfers during the latter part of the year, perhaps induced by tension in the Middle East. The increased trade deficit, although offset to some extent by the improvement in the services account, resulted in the deficit on current account widening from 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2001 to 1.6 per cent in 2002.",

The volume of textile and garment exports grew moderately by 1.4 per cent, but prices declined by 6 per cent. Increased competition from low cost producers, and the sluggish global economic recovery, contributed to depress international prices. The increased prominence of China in global markets, partly as a result of China's entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and continuing high productivity of labour in China may further strengthen the downward trend in international prices. Sri Lanka may face reduced demand for textile and garments with the proposed phasing out of the MFA in 2005 unless strong corrective measures are taken well in advance. The weak performance in exports underscores the vulnerability of Sri Lanka's economy, still dominated by a few items and concentrated in a few markets. Both export products and export markets must be diversified.",

The lack of adequate gateway capacity in the international telecommunications services have compelled foreign investors to request their local counterparts to initiate communications from Sri Lanka. Speedier liberalisation of the international telecommunications market is vital to exploit the potential benefits arising from peace in Sri Lanka and the government's objective in the Regaining Sri Lanka initiative. Under the National Communications Policy, the government took steps in early 2003 to liberalise the international gateway. However, it is important that the market operates in a competitive environment under an efficient regulatory mechanism, to maximise benefits from a liberalised telecommunications market.",

(b) Provisional (c) Services receipts in 2001 include US dollars 382.4 mn. received by Sri Lankan Airlines as insurance claims for the aircraft destroyed by the attack on the airport in July 2001, while Services payments in 2001 include US dollars 292.8 mn. paid to the lessors of the aircraft. The net receipt of these insurance claims was US dollars 89.6 mn.. (d) From 1994 onwards Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) of commercial banks have been treated as a part of the domestic banking system in the compilation of balance of payments statistics.

Net private transfers increased by 12 per cent. This is partly due to an increase in the number of Sri Lankans migrating for foreign employment by 10 per cent to 230,629 during the year. Gross private transfers increased by 11 per cent to US dollars 1,287 million, which included US dollars 1 million received on account of compensation payments in 2002 to Sri Lankan workers who had been displaced in the Gulf War in 1991. The increase in private transfers, particularly during the fourth quarter of 2002, was attributed to increased income in oil exporting countries due to rising crude oil prices and uncertainties in the West Asia, which encouraged Sri Lankans living there to remit more funds.",

    "text": "Worker remittances from the West Asian region accounted for over 60 per cent of total private transfer receipts. However, with the increasing employment in Europe, the share of the West Asian region has declined since 2000. Seventeen per cent of total transfer receipts came from countries in the European Union and this share has gradually increased over the past three years. North America, other European countries and the Far East continued to account for about 7 per cent and 5 per cent each of the total remittances, respectively. Private transfer receipts, which continue to be the second largest foreign exchange earner after net garment exports, were sufficient to cover over 90 per cent of the trade deficit and the deficit in the goods, services and income accounts. These remittances are important for the Sri Lankan economy. However, hardships faced by Sri Lankan workers, particularly in West Asia continue unabated. For example, 228 Sri Lankans were reported dead during employment abroad in 2002, while a large number of Sri Lankans are said to be in prisons abroad. Meanwhile, a section of Sri Lankan workers have been subject to communicable diseases while employed abroad. Ignorance on the part of Sri Lankan workers may be a prime factor for the increasing rate of HIV infection. These issues warrant urgent",

The independently floating, market determined exchange rate policy reduced speculative elements to a large extent and helped to stabilise the exchange rate, while maintaining competitiveness.

The better than expected economic recovery in the third and fourth quarters and high capital flows, specially private remittances, during the second half of the year appear to have contributed to this development. However, the cross exchange rate effects between the US dollar and other major currencies resulted in a larger depreciation of the rupee against other currencies during the year. The rupee depreciated by 18.8 per cent against the euro, 13.1 per cent against the Japanese yen, and 12.9 per cent against the pound sterling. The rupee also depreciated against SDR, the composite unit of account, by 10.7 per cent during 2002.",

However, the tariff regime became less simple with the introduction of new tariff bands of 2 and 20 per cent in November, 2002. Items in the zero per cent band were allocated to the 2 per cent band and 10 per cent band, mainly out of revenue considerations. However, distortions to the tariff regime by way of duty waivers, exemptions and surcharges were maintained at a minimum level. A Tariff Advisory Council was set-up in 2002 to examine and correct anomalies and distortions in the tariff structure and to address representations made by importers and industrialists.",

The procedure for importing low value items was simplified by removing duties, surcharges and other levies applicable to any import with a value less than Rs. 10,000 sent through parcel post in Budget 2002. Amendments were made to the Imports and Export (Control) Act No. 01 of 1969, by Gazette Notification No 1228/15 dated 22 March 2002. Meanwhile a fee of 0.1 per cent was imposed on import licences, subject to a minimum charge of Rs.100 from 22 March 2002 deviating from the objective of minimising constraints on external trade. As the items under the import control licences are limited the revenue from this levy has no significant impact on the government revenue. Gold has been imported to Sri Lanka by licensed commercial banks only on consignment basis. Imports of books, periodicals or ornamental fish for re-exports were also brought under this restriction on 29 August 2002. A total of 353 items at 6 digit level of Harmonised System of Codes (HS Code) remained under import controls by end of 2002.",

The Treaties were mainly intended for preserving political harmony. The economic agreement gradually evolved into a preferential trading agreement, followed by a free trade agreement, a customs union and finally, a monetary union. The membership of the union continues to increase. In addition to political harmony, the benefits of the continuing integration were access to a large common market, specialisation and economies of scale arising out of the large market, and trade creation, which leads to higher incomes in member countries. The costs of integration are mostly political in nature for member countries, such as the loss of sovereignty, and reduced self-sufficiency.

The government withdrew from the monopoly over the import of petroleum products from December 2002. Since January 2002, products of CPC have been free from administered pricing, and were determined by a formula based on international prices, cost of transportation, exchange rate movements, taxes and other fees. FCD acted as the sole authority for the purchase and distribution of wheat flour milled by Prima Ceylon Ltd. till August 2001. The import of wheat and the distribution of wheat flour were handed over to Prima Ceylon Ltd. in September 2001. However, FCD continued to monitor the island-wide distribution of wheat flour and intervene to stabilise prices of essential food commodities during 2002. Even though wheat and wheat flour imports have been liberalised since February 2000, the import of wheat grain and distribution of wheat flour were handled entirely by Prima Ceylon Limited in 2002 as it was the company that had milling capacity and facilities, while only a small quantity of wheat flour was imported in 2002.",

CWE also underwent a significant change in 2002 to meet the challenges of operating as a profit making institution, while functioning as a welfare generating institution for both consumers and producers. With Cabinet approval, CWE has been planned to be restructured to form six strategic business units, viz, Sathosa Retail Ltd., Sathosa Wholesale Ltd., Sathosa Developers Ltd., Sathosa General Ltd., Sathosa Transport Ltd. and Sathosa Security Ltd., to handle key operations of CWE. Of those, Sathosa Retail Ltd. was formed in 2002 and expressions of interest have been called for management and divestiture of 40 per cent of shares of the company.",

In 2002, DIT carried out 2,991 raids under the Consumer Protection Act, Price Control Act, and Fertiliser Regulation Act, of which 1,706 cases were filed in courts and 1,688 offenders were prosecuted. In order to remove duplication of objectives and functions between DIT and FTC, and to create a stronger institution to probe trading practices and to regulate internal trade, a proposal was made in 1997 to amalgamate the two institutions. In January 2002, the Consumer Affairs Authority Bill was formulated and placed before Parliament and under this Act, FTC and DIT was merged to form the Consumer Affairs Authority.

The substantial increase in arrivals from India in 2002 was mainly due to a promotional campaign launched by SriLankan Airlines from August 2001 to June 2002. This enabled the Indian tourists to get a free ticket for each ticket purchased from SriLankan Airlines. This offer was extended to tourists from Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia from 15 February to 15 June 2002. Tourist arrivals from SAARC countries were issued visas on arrival under a new tourism promotion scheme launched by the government from 23 January 2003.
