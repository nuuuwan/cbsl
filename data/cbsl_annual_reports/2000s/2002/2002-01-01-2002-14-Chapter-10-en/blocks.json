    "text": "In the context of declining inflation and greater stability in money and foreign exchange markets, monetary policy in 2002 was focused on providing adequate liquidity to support economic recovery, while giving due consideration to achieving a sustainable path of low inflation. As warranted by economic developments, the Central Bank cautiously reduced further its key policy rates, namely, the Repurchase (Repo) rate and Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) rate, during the year. In contrast to the two previous years, the money market continued to remain liquid in view of the significant foreign inflows and greater fiscal discipline. The Bank absorbed excess liquidity through open market operations, dampening the potential expansionary impact of the build up of foreign assets on monetary aggregates. Reserve money, which is the principal operating target of monetary policy, was maintained within the targets set under the macroeconomic programme. Monetary growth was slightly higher than projected, in the middle of the year, largely due to the low base effect, i.e., the contraction in money supply in the middle of 2001. However, the rate of growth declined towards the end of the year, as projected. During the year, the Bank continued to undertake further measures aimed at enhancing the efficiency and transparency of monetary management. The amendments to the Monetary Law Act (MLA) by Parliament in December 2002 gives greater flexibility to the Central Bank in the conduct of monetary policy.",

The Central Bank reduced its Repo rate and Reverse Repo rate in several steps, a larger part of the reduction being made in the second half of the year. Taking into account the decline in the rate of inflation from the beginning of the year, expectations for the coming months and the decline in international interest rates, both rates were reduced by 50 basis points in March 2002. The Reverse Repo rate was increased by 25 basis points in three steps in March and April, in view of market conditions. As both international interest rates and domestic inflation continued to decline, and there was a need to support the economic recovery and encourage investment, the Repo and Reverse Repo rates were reduced again by 100 basis points in July. A further downward adjustment was effected in November, as inflation further moderated in line with expectations, and market rates declined. A total reduction of 225 basis points was made in 2002 in each rate. An increase in real terms is likely to have occurred in some interest rates,",

In 2002, the Central Bank's interventions were mainly for the purchase of foreign exchange from the market. This contributed to improving rupee liquidity in the market.

Reserve money increased by Rs.14 billion as against an increase of Rs.7.4 billion in 2001, entirely due to an increase in net foreign assets (NFA) of the Central Bank, reflecting the build up of external reserves. In fact, net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central Bank declined. A major share of the increase in reserve money (Rs.12 billion) was in the form of currency in circulation, which partly satisfied higher demand for currency from increased economic activity, especially in the North and East following the peace process. The imposition of a debit tax on deposit withdrawals may also have contributed to enhanced use of currency. Deposits of commercial banks with the Central Bank increased (Rs.2 billion) due to the growth in commercial bank deposits against which reserves are maintained.",

Currency held by the public increased by Rs. 10 billion in 2002 as against Rs.3 billion in 2001, reflecting the recovery in economic activity, especially higher demand following the peace process. The impact of the debit tax and the declining deposit rates may have also contributed to increased currency holdings. Within deposits, the growth in foreign currency deposits increased significantly from US dollars 56 million in 2001 to US dollars 117 million in 2002. The total foreign currency deposit base at end 2002 was US dollars 1,248 million. This growth is attributed to improved confidence in the domestic economy and comparatively lower interest rates available in international markets. In the case of rupee deposits, the share of savings deposits increased, while the share of time deposits decreased. This may be due partly to the relative attractiveness in savings deposits as a result of the larger decline in interest rates on time deposits compared to savings deposits and promotional campaigns by banks for savings deposits.",

As indicated in Budget 2002, the government reduced its overdrafts on state banks sharply from Rs.38.1 billion to Rs.3.6 billion, by issuing market oriented government paper. NCG from the Central Bank declined though NCG from commercial banks increased, partly due to increased holdings of government paper by banks in the context of moderate private sector credit demand.",

These reductions, assisted by increased market liquidity, resulted in a fall in market interest rates. Short-term rates, in particular, call market rates and the average weighted prime lending rate, decreased almost commensurately with Central Bank rates. The downward trend in other market rates and reduced borrowing by the government also caused yield rates on market oriented government securities to decrease.

However, some increase in real interest rates was seen in 2002, as the decline in inflation was about 2 to 5 percentage points (depending on the index chosen). Following the decline in international market rates, interest rates on foreign currency deposits and lending also decreased during the year. A feature in the market rates during 2002 was the low volatility in rates, reflecting improved stability in the money market. Even though both the deposit and lending rates of the banking sector declined during the year, the reduction in lending rates was at a slower pace, resulting in increased interest spreads, and hence banking sector profits. These high interest rate spreads are a symptom of inadequate competition in the financial sector, relatively high non-performing loans of some commercial banks and legal hindrances to fast track recovery of defaulted loans.",

The first reduction of these rates was in March, when the Repo and the Reverse Repo rates were reduced by 50 basis points each to 11.50 per cent and 13.50 per cent, respectively.

This reduction was warranted by the reduction in international rates, and further moderation in inflation and excess rupee liquidity in the market. Even though Sri Lanka's capital account is not open fully and thus its domestic rates are not directly linked to international rates, since the current account is open and Sri Lanka has an independently floating exchange rate, changes in major international rates need to be considered in deciding domestic policy rates. Another reduction of the Repo and the Reverse Repo rates by 75 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively, to 9.75 per cent and 11.75 per cent, were made in November 2002. This reduction was required especially to eliminate an anomaly in the money market rates (which were increased by about 65 basis points on 06 November) caused by a fiscal measure when the government granted a withholding tax credit in respect of secondary market transactions in government paper.",

The variation of call market rates, as measured by the standard deviation of the average call money rate was 4.2 per cent in 2001 and declined to 0.8 per cent in 2002. Call market rates, which were in the range of 12.50-13.00 per cent at end 2001, declined during the first quarter in 2002, and increased in April with seasonal demand and remained relatively high until June. The peak in these rates was observed in May when the maximum rate went up to 13.87 per cent. With the reduction in the Central Bank's policy rates in July and increase in market liquidity, rates declined gradually, thereafter. From end July to end October, call market rates were very stable and moved in the range of 10.50-11.13 per cent and the average call market rate remained close to the Repo rate. However, a sudden increase in the average call market rates by about 65 basis points to 11.44 per cent (maximum rate of 11.75 per cent on 07 November) was observed on 06 November as a consequence of the withholding tax credit granted by the government in respect of secondary market transactions in government paper. The market perception was that the call market rates needed to be raised to equate returns. To offset this increase, the Central Bank reduced its policy rates on 22 November and, subsequently, call market rates declined to a range of 10.00-11.00 per cent. As market liquidity further improved towards the end of the year, call market rates continued to decline gradually. The average rate was 10.39 per cent by end December, while the minimum and maximum rates were in the range of 10.25-10.87 per cent.",

Total resources increased by Rs.46.9 billion (6.3 per cent) in 2002, in comparison to Rs.63.5 billion (9.4 per cent) increase in 2001. On the assets side, this was reflected in the slower growth of total loans and advances, dues from the Central Bank and the acquisition of foreign assets. Total loans and advances, which include loans, overdrafts and purchases of commercial bills, increased by 1.5 per cent in 2002 in comparison to 6 per cent increase in 2001. As a result, the contribution of the growth in total loans and advances to the growth of total assets fell from 34 per cent in 2001 to 12 per cent in 2002. The low growth in loans and advances in 2002 was entirely a result of a decline in overdrafts, as the government reduced its overdraft liabilities",

The slower growth could be partly due to investors reaction to lower interest rates and slow growth in credit extended by banks. The growth in total liabilities (6 per cent) was less than the growth in deposit liabilities as borrowing by commercial banks from both local and foreign sources declined during the year. In the deposits, a compositional shift from demand deposits to time and savings deposits was seen, which could be partly attributed to the debit tax imposed on demand deposits by the government in 2002. Demand deposits declined by 4.7 per cent in 2002 in contrast to a 19.8 per cent growth in 2001. Time and savings deposits grew by 13.4 per cent in comparison to a 15.8 per cent growth in 2001.

As the foreign exchange market was stable throughout the year, the Central Bank was able to purchase foreign currency from the market. Also, the government sold its foreign exchange receipts from foreign loans and from the issue of US dollar denominated SLDBs to the Bank. These purchases of foreign exchange helped to build up official reserves while increasing rupee liquidity in the market. The Central Bank's open market operations mopped up excess rupee liquidity and consequently, holdings of government paper shifted from the Central Bank to commercial banks. Gross official reserves of the Bank were further strengthened as the balance amount under the Stand By Arrangement (SBA) Facility was received during the year.",

Thus, in addition to changes in total assets and liabilities due to normal transactions, some changes in total asset/liabilities were seen due to the adoption of a \"marked to market\" valuation method instead of a \"historical cost\" valuation system.

The Central Bank divested the cheque clearing function to LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd., which became the successor to the Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House. LankaClear is jointly owned by commercial banks and the Central Bank, which exercises oversight over its activities. Preparatory work in connection with the setting up of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System, which will process large value and other critical fund transfers, was finalised. This system is expected to be in operation from last quarter of 2003.

Banks provide a number of services to individuals and businesses which closely link them with the every day life and activities of people. The most traditional function of banks is mobilising savings in the form of various types of deposits from the public and channelling these resources into productive uses. A large percentage of the public, institutions and markets are dependent on banking services in their day-to-day activities. An efficient and stable financial sector is also important for the smooth functioning of the payment system and is the key to the efficient conduct of monetary policy. Further, banks provide other services such as financing of foreign trade, issuing guarantees for the payment of foreign bills and handling foreign inward/outward remittances, which extend banking services in a country beyond its national boundaries. Because of these links, unlike other business failures, any large disruption of banking operations affects the general public as a whole and hence, bank failures are treated differently from failures of other enterprises.",

    "text": "A bank failure is a situation where a bank cannot meet its obligations to depositors and creditors and ceases to carry on the business of banking (Mishkin1 -1997). If a bank becomes insolvent, i.e., when its equity capital is exhausted and its net worth becomes negative, and the authority decides to revoke the banking license, that bank has failed2. A related problem faced by an individual bank is illiquidity, i.e., the inability to meet liabilities on demand in a timely manner. Although illiquidity may be one of the first signs of insolvency, illiquidity does not always cause insolvency. Illiquidity could result from a banking system failure or from a run on banks. It is important to differentiate between an individual bank failure, and a banking system failure. The failure of one bank may lead to a loss of public confidence in the other banks, leading to premature withdrawals of deposits at one time3 due to fear that the banks may not be able to",

    "text": "Banks could fail due to a number of reasons, which could either be internal or external. Although an exact distinction cannot be made, individual bank failures could occur largely due to internal factors such as bad banking practices, taking excessive risks, lack of internal control systems, connected lending4 and moral hazard5. In fact, banks, in their normal banking operations, are exposed to a number of risks. For example, when a loan is granted, a bank is exposed to several risks such as credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and operational risks. If a bank has not taken adequate risk control measures, it would be exposed to these risks. External factors include economic booms and downturns, currency crises, inflation and financial liberalisation, which affect the entire banking system. For instance, in an economic boom, asset prices may rise and the value of collateral increases, especially commercial and residential property values, further expanding the ability to lend. In an economic downturn, the reverse will occur with a decline in collateral value and a rise in credit risks. Financial liberalisation has increased competition among banks and non-banks and has added new instruments which could pose threats to traditional banking activity. Banks that do not have proper risk control systems face a higher risk of becoming insolvent, a situation where capital is eroded.",

If the central bank bails it out, it would lead to monetary expansion. If government funds are used, then taxes need to be raised to fund the bailout or other public expenditure may have to be curtailed, resulting in an inferior quality of public services. If monetary expansion is used to finance the bailout, there will be economic costs in addition to higher inflationary pressure on the economy. An important part of economic costs arise due to moral hazard, i.e., once the decision is made to bail out insolvent banks, there are increased incentives for banks to take higher risks in the future. Another problem is that higher inflationary pressure created by bailouts could increase the risks of further banking crises. The benefits of official intervention in a banking crisis, on the other hand, can be categorised into broad classes that reflect the benefits of intervention to stabilise the banking system and avert a panic and to restore the banking system to a healthy state. These benefits can therefore be characterised as maintaining the integrity of the payments system, and maintaining financial and general economic stability.",

There are many instances when banks have voluntarily opted to merge with other banks, though in some countries the authorities have attempted forced mergers as well. There may, however, be requests to inject funds to facilitate mergers. Second, the authorities could promote market discipline by not allowing automatic financing for troubled banks. Market discipline can also be promoted by having forced exit criteria for insolvent banks. Third, a safety net such as a deposit insurance scheme with risk based premia could be set up. Deposit insurance helps in safeguarding the depositors by minimising the losses and also contributes to reduce the systemic effect of a failure of one bank. Further, the need for public funds for bailouts does not usually arise if there is a deposit insurance scheme. However, one concern in setting up a deposit insurance scheme is the problem of moral hazard as the deposit insurance schemes could tempt banks to take on more risks and depositors too may not be vigilant about banks. Finally, further strengthening regulatory and prudential measures and enhancing the screening process in entry to the banking sector are other areas that could be used to reduce future bank failures.",

The value of Yala 2002 loans was substantially higher compared to the value of Rs.272 million granted in Yala 2001. The major cause for this increase was the granting of more cultivation loans for soya bean, greengram, chillies and gherkin under irrigation with the support of forward sales agreements made with the reputed buyers in the country. In addition to this, under the extended scope of NCRCS, Rs.208 million has been granted for purchase of agricultural produce directly from fanners under the forward sales contracts during the Yala season 2002. The government paid Rs.24 million to lending banks as interest subsidy in respect of cultivation loans granted in 2002 under NCRCS. A sum of Rs.68 million was paid under NCRCS to lending banks as credit guarantee indemnity against the loans granted in earlier years. The amount paid in 2002 by the Treasury for writing off defaulted loans below Rs.20,000 on paddy and banana during the cultivation seasons from Maha 1999/2000 to Yala 2001 amounted to Rs.104 million.",

Consequently, the country managed to accelerate the rate of growth from the previous 3.0 per cent to an average growth rate of 5.5 per cent between 1978 and 1985. However, by mid 1980s, it was revealed that a substantial segment of the population could not successfully integrate themselves with the free market economy policy and therefore, was left behind in the growth process, thereby generating a higher incidence of poverty throughout the country. It was necessary to adopt a targeted poverty alleviation approach to help such left-out groups of the population to facilitate them to cross the poverty line by adopting a holistic poverty alleviation methodology and integrating them to the free market economy system. To attain this objective, the Central Bank launched a pilot poverty alleviation project titled 'Small",

The objective of this Project was to develop a method of new poverty alleviation based on a self-selection process of beneficiaries in partnership with banks, community based organisations and beneficiaries and set standards and procedures for others to replicate it for the same purpose. However, by early 1990s, it was felt that a nationwide poverty alleviation program should be started in order to address the immediate problem of vast unemployment and increase in poverty, which developed into an explosive situation as manifested by the youth insurrection during 1988 to 1990. The establishment of the Janasaviya Trust Fund (JTF), the predecessor of the National Development Trust Fund (NDTF), in 1991 was the first step taken by the government in this regard. To implement the NDTF programme, the World Bank and the Federal Republic of Germany provided a concessionary long-term loan of US dollars 52.8 million to the Government of Sri Lanka which was topped up by US dollars 5 million by the government. The administrative machinery for the implementation of the programme was created by establishing a Trust Fund under the Trust Ordinance. To help the Trust Fund to achieve its objectives, action was taken to enlist the services of lending institutions and community based organisations as partner organisations (POs) of the program.",

This practice is necessary to prevent moral hazard practices by selecting organisations and the resultant adverse selection issue that causes ineligible groups to join the programme. Hence, in the approach of NDTF in which the selection was made by community based organisations, it was necessary for NDTF, to devote resources and energy to closely monitor the work of community based organisations to prevent the abuse of the system by interested parties.",

While the loans approved recorded a healthy 15 per cent growth, the loans disbursed, which stood at Rs.27.8 billion in 2002 as against Rs.25.7 billion in 2001, grew by 8 per cent. This was slightly below the 12 per cent growth in credit to the private sector from commercial banks. The loan growth was caused by higher credit demand in the housing (36 per cent) and financial (136 per cent) sectors. Negative loan growth was reported in the agriculture, industry, tourism and commercial sectors. Despite a 15 per cent increase in loans granted by DFCC Bank, the total loans granted by the two DFIs showed a 20 per cent decline over the previous year as a result of NDB recording a decline of 34 per cent in loans granted. An emphasis on recovery, adoption of a cautious approach in lending and non-use of competitive price cuts to avoid attracting risky borrowers are said to be factors that had an effect on NDB's loan growth. The two non-banks HFIs, Ceylinco Savings Bank, NDB Housing Bank and SMIB, together, approved loans amounting to Rs.4 billion to the housing sector, a 46 per cent growth. Tax concessions granted to housing finance institutions, purchasers and builders and the abolition of stamp duty, NSL and capital gains tax in Budget 2002 have contributed to the growth in credit demand for housing purposes.",

As in the previous year, the increases in assets were almost entirely funded by deposit mobilisation, which accounted for about 88 per cent of sources of funds.

The arbitrage opportunity that existed due to the lower margin of 5 basis points difference between the discount rate for Treasury bills at the secondary window of the Central Bank and the Primary Market Weighted Average Yield Rates (PMYR), made the outright sales more attractive to the market participants, in the face of declining interest rates. The yield rates on Treasury bills were falling at a rate higher than 5 basis points, making it profitable for market participants to buy Treasury bills from the secondary market rather than from the primary market. The Bank took corrective steps to increase the said margin to 125 basis points in three steps by the middle of the year. This had the expected effect as reflected in the decline in outright sales in the second half of the year. The total value of discounted Treasury bills in the first two quarters amounted to Rs.35.5 billion, whereas for the second two quarters, the value was Rs.ll billion. In contrast, the total rediscount of Treasury bills amounted to about Rs. 1 billion, due to excess liquidity in the market throughout the year, and the market rates for rediscounting Treasury bills being higher than the Bank rediscount rates.",

    "text": "The Central Bank conducts Open Market Operations (OMO) as an instrument of monetary policy to achieve the final objective of economic and price stability by influencing the volume of money (level of credit) and its cost (interest rate) in the economy. Central banks the world over have been moving away from non market oriented monetary policy measures such as credit ceilings, quantitative controls and statutory reserve requirements, which operate through regulations, to market based instruments which operate through market forces of the demand and the supply. In line with this general trend in conducting monetary policy, Central Bank of Sri Lanka began to place a greater reliance on OMO as its main instrument of monetary policy. As a major change in its policy thrust, on 03 March 2003, the Bank moved from a system of 'passive' OMO to a system of more active OMO in order to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy operations. This article outlines the rationale for introducing this system, its main features and benefits.",

'Repo' transactions, i.e., selling government securities to commercial banks and primary dealers (i.e., participating institutions) with an agreement to purchase them back within an agreed period at an agreed price, were conducted to absorb liquidity, usually on an overnight basis. Similarly; 'Reverse Repo' transactions, i.e., buying government securities from the participating institutions with an agreement to sell them back within an agreed period at an agreed price were conducted to inject liquidity on a short-term basis; Under the discounting facility, the Central Bank sold Treasury bills outright out of its holdings and thereby absorbed liquidity on a permanent basis; while under the re-discounting facility, government securities were purchased on an outright basis with aconsequent injection of liquidity on a more permanent basis. These facilities were offered at rates of interest (prices) mainly determined by the Central Bank and were utilised by participating institutions, at their discretion.",

The system operates within an explicit monetary targetting monetary policy framework. Monetary targetting has become more important with the floating of the rupee as the exchange rate no longer serves as a nominal anchor for monetary policy. In this framework, the final target of economic and price stability is to be achieved through an intermediate target on the broad money supply which, in turn, is linked to a time path of operating targets on the reserve money. OMO are conducted to ensure the achievement of reserve money targets while maintaining inter bank overnight interest rates, on which the impact of monetary policy decisions is reflected almost instantaneously, stable within a narrow range.",

In such cases, the Central Bank will inject liquidity through reverse repo auctions to cover the deficit and maintain the rate around the middle of the corridor. Similarly, if a surplus emerges, it would be absorbed through repo auctions. The Central Bank makes an assessment of market liquidity daily and decides whether there is a need for either injecting liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the financial system. The decision is announced to the market and bids invited for a repo or reverse repo auction. The auctions are on multiple bid multiple price basis where each participating institution can make up to three bids per auction and allocations to successful bidders are at their bid rate of interest. This system of auctioning is preferred as it encourages competition among participating institutions.",

The slow growth in commercial paper issues could be attributed to the decline in their relative attractiveness with the reduction of lending rates of commercial banks, and the withholding tax on interest earnings from commercial paper imposed in 2002. The bulk of the issues (98 per cent) were supported by commercial banks. The commercial paper market is heavily concentrated (75 per cent) in the three month maturity, with CPs of six months duration accounting for almost all the balance. The outstanding value of CPs at year end was Rs.5.6 billion.",

In June 2002, the balance US dollars 91.5 million was raised in the third and the final tranche, increasing the total liability under the SLDB issue to US dollar 250 million. Unlike the previous two issues, the participants were given more flexibility in determining the tenor and the yield, subject to certain limits. The SLDBs were offered with a minimum maturity period of two years, and the rate of interest payable was 6 month LIBOR per annum plus a margin up to 2 percentage points per annum. Targeted investors were foreign citizens and entities, non-resident Sri Lankans, authorised dealers who are commercial banks, and primary dealers. However, all successful applicants were commercial banks. All offers were for 2-year maturity and the weighted average yield was 1.94 per cent over 6 month LIBOR.",

As the debt management strategy was to raise more market oriented debt, the total amount of debt raised through Treasury bonds increased substantially from Rs.47 billion in 2001 to Rs.207 billion in 2002. In order to reduce the bunching of repayments in the future and improve the liquidity in key benchmark issues, measures were taken to consolidate issues in key maturities. With a view to enabling institutional investors to plan their investments in government securities, a borrowing calendar was issued to market participants. In addition to market borrowing, a few private placements were made to key strategic investors when the maturing amounts were large and to match their existing maturing government paper. Steps were also taken during the year, to further promote the government securities market, Treasury bonds in particular. These included work on an SSS system, including a depository for government securities",

Another feature discernible during the year was the shift in investment in government securities from short-term Treasury bills to longer-term Treasury bonds to lock in higher yields in a declining interest rate environment. This is further evident from the fact that investment in very short-term instruments like repos have dropped to zero level. The rise in the total value of investment has contributed to an increase in the net asset per unit from Rs.7.35 to Rs.9.62 in 2002.",

However, it must be noted that higher returns are invariably linked with higher risks.

Four sectors declined during the year; viz., Health Care, declined marginally by 1.9 per cent; Information Technology, which was introduced in May, declined by 10 per cent; Oil Palms and Plantations declined by 10.5 per cent and 15.5 per cent, respectively. Worldwide, technology stocks did not show any significant recovery, with the US economic recovery being slower than anticipated. With respect to plantations, rubber prices rose following the curtailment of production in the three major producer countries, namely, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, while the outlook for tea prices was promising, with some major producer countries experiencing a drop in output. However, trade union action, which culminated in a wage hike for the estate workforce with effect from July 2002, is reported to have had a significant negative impact on sector profitability.",
