The .increased'installed capacity arid sufficient water levels in reservoirs were the main factors contributing to the expansion in the hydro-power sector. The increased supply of hydro electricity not only enhanced the energy, supply, but also reduced, significantly oil based thermal power generation, and reduced petroleum consumption in the household and industrial sectors. A s a result, the share of petroleum in the total supply of. commercial energy declined from 60 per cent in 1984 to 54 per cent in 1985. These developments, together with low international prices for petroleum, resulted in a drop in net outjay on petroleum by 9 per c\u00abnt iri SDR terms thereby reducing the pressure on the balance of paymerits. . . \u2022",
