    "text": "The second SMI line of credit amounting to US $ 30 million granted by the International Development Association (IDA) in 1982 achieved slow utilization in the initial years. However, with the increase of the maximum loan size from Rs. 2 million to Rs. 4 million and the wider spread offered to participating credit institutions, approvals of loans indicated a rapid increase. Correspondingly, the credit guarantees issued by the Central Bank increased to 831 loans covering Rs. 382.3 million. By the end of 1985, 23 loans had been repaid in full while 79 loans had fallen into arrears. Participating credit institutions had submitted 5 claims amounting to Rs. 0.31 million and they are under consideration. An industry-wise classification of loans granted under SMI-II is shown in Table 2.6.",

Under the new scheme a bank can approve a credit limit for each borrower for a period of three years so as to avoid the submission of loan applications at the beginning of each and every season. The new scheme also expects the banks to adopt an area approach in the provision of production credit to the farming community. The inclusion of Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies (TCCSs) and Multi-Purpose Co-operative Societies (MPCSs) as junior partners in the operation of the scheme is another new feature. The scheme also provides for rescheduling of loans that go into default on account of natural calamities. The Central Bank provides refinance in respect of rescheduled loans at an interest rate of 1.5 per cent per annum. Further, the banks are empowered to grant cultivation loans to borrowers whose repayment performance has been good in the past, without guarantee upto Rs. 7,500. Further to achieve effective monitoring of the scheme, a reporting system has been incorporated in the scheme which also lays the ground work for computerising the data relating to lending under the scheme.",

As a result, a large number of persons were able to be accommodated under various rural credit schemes designed for the development of rural economic sectors. There was increasing demand for credit from farmers, cottage industrialists and artisans to improve their income by expanding investments while at the same time an increasing number of school leavers wanted to join the bank credit schemes in order to establish themselves in self-employment activities. As in the previous years, the operation of Refinance Credit Schemes, one of the measures introduced by the Central Bank to promote growth in output, income and employment in the rural sectors, assumed a most significant position in the affairs of the Regional Office. As at end of 1985, the total number of individuals who were able to obtain assistance from the banking system through direct negotiations arranged by this office was 2,728 and the total amount of loans obtained for various income generating projects was Rs. 14.1 million.",

    "text": "As the Regional Office completed its fifth year of operations, one of the important aspects of its activities was the increase in its area coverage. Since 1983, requests for rural credit facilities emanating from various quarters in the neighbouring districts steadily increased due to the improvements in infrastructure facilities resulting from the implementation of large scale development projects and programmes in the region. Consequently, the Regional Office was able to spread its influence into the districts of Galle, Hambantota and Moneragala during the year 1985. Efforts were made to arrange bank loans for several selected projects in these areas and to foster favourable banker-customer dialogue. A training and orientation programme was conducted as in the previous years. Nearly 900 individuals took part in 40 sessions during 1985. These sessions revealed that projects sometimes put forward by certain individuals, were not feasible or were ill conceived. It also helped as an occasion for sharing experience among the beneficiaries and agencies as well. The sessions also act as a meeting place for all the important agencies involved in the process. The Regional Office received the support of the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Agriculture Development Authority, the Crop Insurance Board, the Department of Animal Production and Health, the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority and similar institutions. In turn, the Regional Office lent its assistance to various development projects implemented by these agencies. The Regional Manager and his staff participated in about 50 such seminars and workshops conducted in 1985. Members of the staff also served on most of the development committees that exist at regional level and at the centre.",

The Industrial Sector which accounted for the largest number of projects was domina\u00adted by the food, textiles, bricks and tiles industries. The agriculture sector was over\u00adwhelmed with livestock farming projects, mostly poultry farming units. A detailed break-down of Self-Employment and Village Adoption project financing is shown in Tables 2.13 and 2.14. It may be noted that the figures in Table 2.13 show the total number of projects identified and recommended by the Regional Office as at end of 1985. This is a cumulative position as adjusted from time to time to account for the drop-out projects. It is observed that owing to various obstacles, a large number of project proposals tend to get lagged and dropped before making bank finance available. Sometimes, the applicants found it almost impossible to satisfy the conditions laid down by the bankers who are not obliged to approve loans for the projects identified by the Central Bank Regional Office. There is much scope for bank authorities to effect improvements to the lending procedures and develop a credible small sector lending programme for the growth of the rural economy.",

Thus, there is a considerable degree of uncertainty in the cultivation of paddy and therefore the risks in lending to paddy sector are great. Against this natural background and amidst the legacy of high rate of defaults in the past, a fresh attempt was made by the Regional Office to renew the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme in the Paddy Sector by introducing a closely supervised credit package called \"Model Yaya Paddy Cultivation Loan Scheme\". Under this arrangement farmers obtained crop loans in a more organized and guided manner and there were more back-up services made available during the season for the benefit of the farmer. Started with a handful of farmers in Tangalle in 1981/82 Maha Season, the movement spread fast into Matara, Hambantota and Moneragala districts. There are at present about 1200 acres of paddy lands for which loans totalling Rs. 1.9 million are disbursed every season. The loans are likely to increase rapidly due to the establishment of the Regional Rural Development Bank.",

Various non-governmental organizations lent their support to these groups to increase output, expand sales and achieve better prices. As at end of 1985, there were 21 such groupings involving more than 400 members. There were many discussions and technical sessions, clinics, camps and demonstrations organized by the Regional Office for the benefit of these groups.",

For this purpose, the Regional Office is expected to identify development potential, resolve problems of development lending, and provide neces\u00adsary assistance and guidance to the banking sector. The Regional Bank also attempted to make rural people aware of available loan facilities with concessionary interest rates and to change their present faulty attitudes. In this regard, convincing the farmers about the advantages of becoming good customers is essential, thereby eliminating the unsatisfactory banking practices and habits through a continuous dialogue with them. It is expected that this exercise would ultimately lead to bridging the ever widening gap between the village folk and the\" banker and so building a healthy banking structure for the development of the rural sector.",
