Consequently, the overal budget deficit/GDP ratio was progressively reduced from 25 per cent in 1980 to 10 per cent in 1984. The gradual reduction in budget deficits over these years and overall improvement in the fiscal management were of assistance, in reducing the rate of inflation in recent years. However, the reduction in government revenue caused by the sharp decline in export prices, high expenditures on defence related activities and- growing interest payments on public debt resulted in a higher resource gap in the budgetary operations in 1985. As a result, the net impact of budgetary operations were relatively more expan\u00adsionary,- i* .. - \u2022 ,",

The expenditure performance, on the other hand, indicated the short-run difficulties in adjusting government expenditure to shortfalls in government revenue. The efforts to contain budgeted expenditure, were discounted by the substantial increase in supplementary expenditure provisions and over extended net lending through advance account operations.",
