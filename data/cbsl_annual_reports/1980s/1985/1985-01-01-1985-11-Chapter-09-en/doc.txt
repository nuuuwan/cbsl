GOVERNMENT FINANCE*

Price stability nas" been a major objective of budgetary policy in recent years Concerted efforts have been made to contain total expenditure in line with available resources to ensure that budget deficits are at sustainable levels. Consequently, the overal budget deficit/GDP ratio was progressively reduced from 25 per cent in 1980 to 10 per cent in 1984. The gradual reduction in budget deficits over these years and overall improvement in the fiscal management were of assistance, in reducing the rate of inflation in recent years. However, the reduction in government revenue caused by the sharp decline in export prices, high expenditures on defence related activities and- growing interest payments on public debt resulted in a higher resource gap in the budgetary operations in 1985. As a result, the net impact of budgetary operations were relatively more expan­sionary,- i* .. - • ,

The performance of government finance in 1985 demonstrated the structural weakness in the country's, fiscal system. The shortfall in government revenue underscored the weakness arising.from a heavy reliance on commodity export taxes and few alternative steady revenue sources to fiinance the programmed expenditure. The expenditure performance, on the other hand, indicated the short-run difficulties in adjusting government expenditure to shortfalls in government revenue. The efforts to contain budgeted expenditure, were discounted by the substantial increase in supplementary expenditure provisions and over extended net lending through advance account operations.

Though achieving a budget deficit within a sustainable level was a difficult task owing to the economic circumstances during the year, the primary objective of maintaining a reasonable level of price stability became essential in order to avoid the repetition of macro-economic instability as in 1980. Therefore heavy reliance had to be placed on monetary measures.

Budgetary Outturn

Revised estimates for 1985 revealed a marginal decrease of 1 per cent in total revenue at Rs. 37,344 million. The revenue /GDP ratio at 23 per cent in 1985 was lower than that in 1984, when the country experienced exceptionally high prices for its export commodities and consecuently, higher tax revenue. However, the revenue/ GDP ratio in 1985 remained relatively higher than the average ratios in the 1980-1983 period.

The growth in total current expenditure inclusive of advance account outpayment, at 12 per cent in 1985 was much lower than the growth of 21 per cent in 1984. However, the ratio of current expenditure to GDP increased to 22 per cent in 1985 compared to 21 per cent in 1984. The overall performance in current account operations resulted in a surplus of Rs. 1,573 million as compared with a surplus of Rs. 5,889 million in 1984. Although the current account surplus declined in 1985, it continued the trend of generating a surplus observed since 1981.

Despite the reduction in current account surplus the capital expenditure increased during 1985 largely on account of higher amortization payments. Total capital expenditure inclusive of amortization payments at Rs. 31,332 million indicated an increase of 44 j>er cent over the previous year.

The relative importancei of using foreign resources in financing the deficit declined in 1985. Total foreign finance at Rs. 12,894 million' was 43 per cent of the overall budget deficit compared with 71 per cent in the previous year. However, the use of foreign resources increased from 7" per cent of GDP to'8 percent in 1985. The use. of resources from domestic hbn-bank sources amounting to Rs. 10,597 million accounted for 30 per cent compared with 42 per cent in 1984.

In financing the deficit, Rs. 7,127 million was raised from the banking system. However, as a result of an increase of Rs. 1,098 million in government cash balances and deposits held; with banking system, net expansionary impact of the deficit was limited, to Rs. 6,029 million. Data in respect of the fiscal operations with comparable figuresi for the previous years is presented in Table 1.39.

Revenue

Total government revenue was Rs. 37,344 million in 1985. This was a decline of 1 percent compared with an increase of 50 per cent in the previous year. Government revenue declined from 70 per cent of total government expenditure in 1984 to nearly 56 per cent in 1985 and as a share, of GDP it decreased from 25 per cent in 1984 to 23 per cent in 1985,

Total tax revenue from income, production and expenditure taxes amounted to Rs. 30,815 million as compared with Rs. 31,215 million in 1984. This decline in tax revenue was largely on account of lower receipts from export based taxes. Non tax revenue amounting to Rs. 6,529 million registered a marginal increase in 1985.

Income taxes consisting of personal and corporate taxes amounted to Rs. 5,852 million and formed 19 per cent of government tax revenue. Income taxes remained at 3.6 per cent of GDP in 1985 as in the previous year. The buoyancy of income taxes, which indicates the response of income taxes to changes of National Income declined from 2.4 in 1984 to 1.7 in 1985. Personal income taxes which accounted for 21 per cent of the total income taxes declined by 30 per cent to Rs. 1,225 million in 1985, in contrast to. nearly a 100 per cent increase in the previous year. The sharp decline in receipts from personal income taxes was largely due to downward adjustments "in tax rates, widening of tax slabs, increase in exemption limits and the cessation of rehabilitation levy in 1985. In contrast, corporate income taxes amounting-to-Rs,,4,427 million registered a-2.4per cent increase in 1985 as against an increase of 50 per cent in 1984.

Total revenue from taxes on production and expenditure (export duties, import duties, turn-over taxes, excise taxes and licence fees) at Rs. 24,908 million was slightly lower than in 1984. Production and expenditure taxes, which formed 81 per cent of tax revenue in 1985 declined by 3 per cent compared with an increase of 49 per cent in 1984.

Overall reduction in commodity prices and the policy response by way of adjustments in the duty structure in order to safeguard profit margins of producers reduced the relative importance of export duties in government revenue. Revenue from export duties declined sharply by 41 per cent to Rs. 1,870 million in contrast to an increase of 29 per cent in 1984. The relative share of export duties in government revenue declined substantially in 1985. Export duties, which form nearly 24 per cent of government tax revenue between 1978 and 1984, declined to 6 per cent in 1985 while the export tax/GDP ratio declined to 1 per cent.

Consequent to the reduction in export duties and a marginal decline in the volume of exports, the revenue collection from export duties on tea.declined by 33 per cent while that of rubber declined by 75 per cent. Inspite of the downward revision of the export duty on Coconut,revenue collection from coconut kernal products increased by 4 per cent due to a substantial increase in the volume of exports.

C WJ. )

Revenue from import duties increased by 6 per cent; oyer the previous year to Rs. 8,397 million. Import duty accounted for 27 per cent of government tax revenue in 1985 compared to 25 per cent in the previous year. Despite the increase in the domestic value of imports, the marginal increase in import duties resulted from the implementation of proposals of the Presidential Tariff Commission! which aimed at rationalising the import duty structure based on effective rate of protection to local industries. , .

Selective sales taxes consisting of tea ad-valorem tax and excise duties on liquor and tobacco.yielded Rs. 3,928 million, and formed :13 per cent of government tax revenue. Collection from tea ad-valorem tax declined substantially by 68 per cent owing to the sharp drop in tea prices while receipts from excise duties on liquor increased marginally. The receipts from excise duty oh tobacco amounted to Rs. 1,878 million, as compared with Rs. 1,537 million in 1984. The sharp increase was due to the upward revision in tax rates and a higher volume Of sales. The reduction of revenue -collection under selective sales taxes was due to lower collections from tea which more than offset the increases in collections from liquor and tobacco,: ; , . .

For the fourth consecutive year, turnover taxes turned out to be the largest source of government revenue at.Rs. 10,195 million and registered a,25 per cent increase over the previous year. Its contribution to total tax revenue increased from 26 per cent in 1984 to 33 per cent in 1985, while as a proportion of G D P it increased from 5.3 per cent in 1984 to 6,4.per cent in 1985. The buoyancy of turnover taxes, which measures the response of turnover tax to the .changes in ' gross domestic expenditure, is estimated at 2.51 in 1985 compared to 1.89 in 1984. The higher: revenue : buoyancy of turnover taxes was largely a result of. the discretionary measures introduced in the budget for 1985, which aimed at expanding the tax base. These measures included increase in tax rates, widening of the tax base and better law enforcement. Tax collection from the manufacturing sector at Rs. 3,619 million was an increase of 19 per cent, while the collection through turnover taxes : from non-manufacturing sector ;at Rs. 2,746 million was a 42 per cent increase. Turnover taxes "on imports increased by 21 per cent to Rs. 3,830 million.

In spite of the increase in licence fees, receipts from this source of revenue declined marginally to Rs. 190 million. Collection from property transfer taxes amounted to Rs. 328 million and indicated a decline of 19 per cent.

Total nan tax revenue amounting to Rs. 6,529 million formed 18 per cent of govern­ment revenue in 1985. Interest income registered a 72 "per cent increase largely due to higher receipts from sinking fund investment. Total profits and dividends which amounted to Rs. 425 million indicated a decline of 24 per cent. A sum of Rs. 1,500 million of non-tax revenue was a profit transfer from the Central Bank to the Government on account of stettlement' of government debt obligations to the Central Bank-.- •

Total payments on account of interest on government debt amounted to Rs. 8,527 million reflecting an increase of 15 per cent over the previous year. The interest payments as a percentage of total current expenditure at 24 per cent compared with 23 per cent in the previous year.

Advance accounts operations in 1985 resulted in a net outpayment of Rs. 2,150 million as compared with Rs. 2,916 million in the previous year. The increase in .net outpayments on advance account was reflected in the accounts relating to govern­ment departments, loans from advance accounts and surplus balances and advances for stores and materials. Major outpayments in 1985 were in respect of food purchase and distribution account (Rs. 1,130 million), Public Corporations (Rs.705 million), Civil Medical Stores (Rs. 187 milhon), Telecommunication Stores Account (Rs. 63 million ) and the Railway Department (Rs. 33 million).

During the year, the total gross capital expenditure amounted to Rs. 31,332 milhon. The increase in capital expenditure by 44 per cent over the previous year was mainly due to higher repayment of rupee loans and largely attributable to the abolition of sinking fund operations.

The capital expenditure exclusive of amortization payments amounted to Rs. 24,623 million indicating an increase of 26 per cent over 1984. Net capital expenditure in relation to GDP increased from 13 percent in 1984 to 15 per cent in 1985.

Of the total capital expenditure, transfers to Corporations during the year amounted at Rs. 11,691 million was 1 per cent less than in the previous year. These transfers included a sum of Rs. 5,492 milhon on Mahaweli Development Programme and Rs. 1,095 million on Water Supply and Drainage Board. Allocation Of capital expenditure by way of loans to certain corporations amounted to Rs. 1,770 million compared with Rs. 901 million in the previous year. The major recipient of these loans was the Ceylon Electricity Board for investments in trans­mission and distribution projects. Capital transfers to local government authorities amounted to Rs. 64 million, while transfers to the other institutions amounted to Rs. 269 million. Capital expenditure on behalf Of government departments and ministries amounted to Rs. 10,754 million recording nearly 65 per cent increase over the previous year. However, the recorded under-expenditure on capital expenditure was around 6 per cent in 1985. A detailed breakdown of government expenditure is given in Table 1.41.

Budget Deficit and its Financing

Budgetary operations m 1985 resulted in an overall deficit of Rs. 29,759 million recording nearly a two-fold increase over the previous year. The overall deficit accounted for 44 per cent of total government expenditure in 1985 as compared with 30 psr cent in 1934. As a ratio of GDP, the overall deficit increased from 10 per cent in 1984 to 19 per cent in 1985. Net cash deficit amounting to Rs. 23,050 million in 1985 registered a sharp increase Of 69 per cent over the previous year while the net cash deiicit/GJkP ratio increased from 9 pet cent to 14 per cent in 1985.
