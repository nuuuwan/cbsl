    "text": "Monetary developments during 1985 were characterised by a continuing dece\u00adleration in monetary aggregates for the second year in succession. This took place against a background of a sharp increase in net credit to government, a moderate increase in credit to the private sector and a decline in net external assets of the banking system. The narrow money supply (M,), comprising currency and demand deposits held by the public increased by Rs. 1,937 million or 12 per cent during the year compared with an increase of Rs. 2,076 million or 14 per cent in 1984. Meanwhile, time and savings deposits of the private sector held with commercial banks (quasi-money) rose by Rs. 3,044 million or 11 per cent. In 1984, quasi-money grew by Rs. 4,095 million or 18 per cent. Consequently, the broad money supply (M 2) consisting of M, plus quasi-money, increased by Rs. 4,982 million or 11 per cent in 1985. The growth in M 2 in 1984 was much higher at Rs. 6,171 million or 17 per cent.",

Currency in circulation increased by Rs. 1,255 million or 15 per cent whereas it rose by Rs. 1,361 million or 19 per cent in 1984. The highest monthly increase in currency was recorded in March (12 per cent). This increase was due to the seasonal demand for cash balances prior to the April festive season. Demand deposits held by the public increased moderately by Rs. 683 million or 8 per cent in 1985. The increase in 1984 was Rs. 715 million or 9 per cent. The share of demand deposits in M, declined from 49 per cent in 1984 to 48 per cent in 1985.",

    "text": "Although in absolute terms, quasi-money registered an increase of Rs. 3,044 million, the rate of growth declined from 18 per cent in. 1984 to 11 per cent in 1985. The relatively low rate of growth was largely due to the downward revision of time and savings deposit rates effected by commercial banks on several occasions and the lower growth in income associated with the drop in external earnings during the year. The deceleration in quasi-money was largely in government corporation deposits which rose only by Rs. 301 million or 6 per cent. In comparison, the increase in 1984 was Rs. 1,428 million or 35 per cent. This was mainly due to the decline in such deposits of the two plantation corporations resulting from the decline in tea prices. Meanwhile, deposits of the other private sector constituents (OPSC) also declined. Notwithstanding this, the share of time and savings deposits in M 2 remained unchanged at 61 per cent.",

It is noteworthy that N C G increased sharply by Rs.6,137 million or 42 per cent as against a decline of Rs. 2,979 million or 17 per cent in 1984. Consequently, the share of N C G in total domestic credit rose from 29 per cent in 1984 to 35 per cent in 1985. The increase in N C G was the net result of",

The continuation of the credit ceibngs imposed in March and May, 1984 and the reduced demand for credit in nominal terms due to the deceleration in the inflation rate resulted in a decline in GCPS. Bank credit to the other private sector constituents (OPSC) took the form of loans (Rs. 2,090 million), overdrafts ;(Rs. 689 million) and import bills (Rs. 133 million). Credit to co-operative institutions declined by Rs. 263 million or 17 per cent in continuation of a decline of Rs. 255 million Or 14 per cent in 1984, mainly due to reduced marketing activities of the Paddy Marketing Board and reduction in cultivation loans granted under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme during Maha 1984/1985 and Yala 1985 seasons.",
