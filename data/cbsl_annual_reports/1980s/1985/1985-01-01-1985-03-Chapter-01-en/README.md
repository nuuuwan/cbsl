ECONQMlC, PERFORMANCE -1985

Ov~I:riew

The achi~vement of an. overall economic gr~wth raieof 5 per' cent in 198.5 with

pri~ stabiiity was re~arkabie in' an' unfavourable external' economic environment and internal unrest in some parts of the country. The sources of this growth were mainly froni ~griculture' an4 manuf~cturing.· : . .

" . . net ol!tfi<?w' of factor income resulted in the :real Gross National Product' (GNP) increasing by 5-:3 per cent compared to an increase of 5.1 'per cent in 1984 and 4.1' per cent in 1983. The GNP at current factor cost: price's was i7pet' Cent higher than in 1~84. Per capita <!NP increased by .3.7 per cent to reach Rs. 9,219 (l,JS $ 339) in 1985. , .' . . .' , , . . .' .

J ._.

The increase' in 'the implicit GNP deflator by only 1.5 per cendsin ~harP ~~ntrast

~o an increase of 17.4 per cent in' the previous year .. The increase in. consumer prices as indicated in the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI): was also 1:S per cent. This increase in the CCPI was the lowest since 1978. The improved supply of agricultural commodities, relative stability in 'import prices, stable domestic prices of petrole~ pr~ducts, the lagg~d . effect of the rion expansionary fiscal

policies of 1984 and the effects of the restrictive credit :policies pursued since, 1984 were the factors responsible for this low rate of inflation.

" The decline in commodity prices, particularly of tea and c.ocanut, was a significant adverse economic devei6pment in i985 .. The continued reduction in tourist traffic and the consequent· decrease in tourist dependent service industries, the increased expenditure on defence related activities, slowing down of foreign investment and disruption of economic activities in the northern and ,eastern: parts of .the. country were' the other.major unfavourable.economic developments in 1985.

Despite these adverse factors, the economy grew at an impressive rate·· owing to the.,continued expa,nsJon, in the agricultural sector whi~h accounts fo~ about one-fourth o~ the ~ountry's' GDP. Paddy,produ~tio~, which fell In 1984 due to~ ." .. \. . , . -"-

These developments in both domestic agriculture and plantation .crops' together with thei~ consequentiai inlpact onagfo-processing and trade 'were'largely'responsible for'the- maintenance of a 5 per cent growth rate: .... . .... ,'.:: .,.: ' .....,. -~ . .'

Industrial production which inc~~ased in 1984 by 15 per cent continued to grow though at a slower rate of 5 per cent. The growth was once again in private sector industries, whose value of industrial output increased by 20 per cent. . While private manufacturing registered this high rate ~f. growth on.top,o~ a 26 pe~·~ent growth in 1984, public industrial sector ip.dustries. declined·by 6 per cent in lQ85 ... · . .' .. . . . ' . Indications are that employment generation in 1985 was sOPlewhat lim~ted. Government sector employment is estimated to have i~creased by' 1.5 per cent 'but employment in semi-government institutions declined by 2.4 per cent. The decljne in employment in semi-goVernment institutions is largeiy ~: reflection of economic rationalization in' several public sector enterprises, imd ,the' privittisation of a few

~em,i-government entetprises with .poor· performance. ,Private sector 'employment; however, appears to have increased somewhat, both in the organised and: tlUorga: nised sub-sectors, though firm data are not yet available.

The country's trade performance was unfavourable mainly due to the 'sharp decline in export prices. For the first time since 1972 the value of exports declined,

while import outlays grew at a faster rate than in the previ~)l:ls two years. , . . . ~ .' , . .... . .' \ ..

The magnitude of the impact of cominodity price declines call·be· gauged by the fact that tea prices declined by 26 per cent, rubber prices by 23 per Cent arid coconut prices by 49 per cent. Th~ export of textiles and re~dY-ll1ade gannents;which had displayed a continuous increase since 1977, declined by 1 per cent and exports of other industrial product,S, in~reased by 4 percent.. Despite an increase of 11 per cent in petroleum pr~duct exports, the combined export earnings from. all non-traditional exports increased by. only 8 per cent. . . .'

The increased expenditure on merchandise imports was a result of higher imports of consumer and intermediate goods. Increased imports of f90d items-rice, sugar and wheat-were the main reasons for the higher expenditure on consumer imports .. Larger fertilizer imports accounted for the increased outlay on intennediate.imports. . . . ..-

The substantial deterioration in 'the balance' ~f payments'iP '1985 'is on~ of the most serious adverse developments. The deterioration in both the current account and the overall balance was mainly due to the deterioration in primary commodity prices, the poor performance of most non-traditional exports and increased import volt.ulles. ' , . .

. Important steps taken' in recent years to . improve :the' energy situation showed signifiCant results ·in, 1985. The increased generation of hydro-electriCity'in 1985 was due to enhanced installed capacity and 'sufficient water leveE; in reservoirs. The increased supply of hydro-electricity not only enhanced the energy SUpply, but also·· reduced significantly oil based thermal power generation and ·reduced. petroleum' consumption. Consequently, the share of petroleum in the total supply of COIiUne(-:

~ial energy declined from 60 per cent in 1984 to- 54 per ~e~t -in ,1985., Th~~ development$ . 90mbiued wjth low. interQationalprices fot· petrQ~ resulted' in a· decrease iii the- vafue of petroleum imports by 9 per· cen£ iii SDR terms ·therebY. reducing the pressure on the balance of payments. . , .. -

The ~~dgetii.ry operati~ns .in 1985 ",ere' more. expansionary than in the preyi9us yea,r .. ,Shortfa~s in government revenue from e~pocts, largely due to decreased export commodity' prices, and continued expansion in government expenditure, mainly due to defence related activities and losses in public enterprises, increlJsed the blldget deficit.

Gross I'raii~n'al Product at current factor' cOst prices is esti~ated. at Rs. 146 billion in 'l985--an increase of 6.9 percent from that of 1984. The implicit price deflator 'is' estimated to have increased by only 1.5 per eent;in contrast to the increase. of 17.4'per cent hi the previous year .. This marked decline in the GNP deflator is mainly due to·the decrease,iil'export priCes of major agriculturillproducts .. . . . ~. . .

Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF), which includes cha:nges' in stocks, increased by only 4.1 per cent compared with a growtli of 13.0 per cent in the preceding year. Capital formation in the private sector and public corporations together decreased by 7.3 per cent, in contrast to a growth of 11.8 per cent in 1984. In the government sector, gross capital formation increased "by 57.3 -per" cent ill 1985 compared to an increase :of-18.9 pet cent in the previous year.

Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation (GDFCF) increased· by 3.9 per cent compared to an increase of 1l.9 per cent in the previous year. The total value of imported investment gO,ods decrea~edby 17.1 per ,cent in 1985 as compared with an increase of 5,0 per 'cent in 1984 and the import content·of Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation redueed to 23.1 per cent in 1985, compared to 28;9 per cent in 1984 .. The completion of headworks of the Mahaweli Scheme resulted in ~ large reduction in capital goods imports.

In 1985 the predominant share (73.2 per cent) of Gross Domestic Fixed Capital· Formation, was within the private sector and public corporations. As in 1984, the largest share of capital formation was in building and other construction. Capital formation in land development and replanting increased by 32.1 per cent.

The total resources available to the economy in 1985 was Rs. 221.3 billion; of which Rs. 159.8 billion came from domestic sources and Rs. 61.5 billion from imports. Domestic resources accounted for 72.2 per cent of resources in 1985 compared to 74.2 per cent in 1984. While 18.7 per cent was expended on capital formation, 62.3 per cent was spent on consumption. The comparable figures for ,1984 were. 19.2 per cent on capital formation and 59.5 per cent on consumption. The exports of goods and non factor services amounted to 19.0 per cent of the total resources in 1985 as against 21.4 per cent in 1984.

" In contrast to the two previous years, domestic savings decreased by 28.3 per cent in the current year: from Rs.· 30.6 billion in. 1984 to Rs. 21.9 billion in 1985. Domestic savings were 13.7 per cent of GDP at market prices in 1985 compared to 19.9 per cent in 1984. Total national savings, which include net foreign factor income and private transfers decreased by 24.6 per cent to reach Rs.25.8 billion in 1985. The ratio of national.savings to GDP fell from 22.2 per cent in 1984 to 16.1 per cent in 1985.

The .decline in exports was largely due ·to !owerearnings from tea and rubber. Although there was a' drastic drop i;n ,coconut pri~s in- the international tllB.Iket; the exceptionally hi~ volume of coconut exports resulted in increased export earnings from coconut products. Other exports such as minor agricultural crops and gems also declined; Textiles and garments which in :the -past showed rapid .increases, 4eclined in real tenn& •

.The ~~ase 1n imports wa~ .largely due to the higher ouflays on·consunter' goods;: particularly food and drink and other consumer goods. The growth· in· censumei imports in a context of decreased export earnings had se~ous implications for the balance of·payments.· .

. Provisional CUstomS" data indicate'thanhe ex~p.diture on imports Was Rs. 49,.069 million (SDR 1,776 milliqn) and' the' earnings from exports was Rs. 3.$,035 million (SOR '1,268' million). The resulting deficit Qf Rs. 14,034 million ,{SPR 508 million) was 34 PeT cent higher in SDR:terms than that of the pr~vious year when: it was Rs; 9,907 million (SDR 380 million). Whe~Ctis,tomS oata . are 'adjusted for. lags and other'factors reiating- to recordin,g, the trade 'deficit was RS. 16,710 'million (SDR 605 million): . 'This was S5 per cent higher in 'SDR tenns than the. aeficit of Rs. 10,194 million (SDR 391 million) in 1984. ' ,

. ' ' After a considerable' improYement in the 1eonS 'of trade'ln' the'taSttwo years,; the ·umavourable' prices of both exports and imparts!~ulted i,n adeterioraiion of' Sri Lanka's terms of trade in 1985 by almost 2lpercent. As measut:ed by the Central Bank'~ new .trade in.dice~, expert, prices decreased by 15. percent. while import prices increased by 11 per cent. The ellport/impori ratio widened in 1985 :'

e~ports which ,amcnmt<:d to 79 percent of total imports in 1984 dtopped to 68 per cent in 1985. Thus, the ability 10 finance imports from own 'resources weakened· and recourse to foreign financing increased. In an emerging international economic enviiomnerit where aid may be more difiicultto obtaiB thiS level of f-oreign finaneed imports may not be suStainable in the future.-: ' ," '.'

Monetary and Credit Developments

Iif~~ The sharp growth in net credit ~o govemment (NCG) largely influenced monetary qevelopments in 1985. 'The progressive grQwtli in NCG was more evident during the

seco.~d half"ofthe year when it rose from 15 per cent ai ~end'ofJu~e to 42 per cent, at ~he end of 1985. This large growth inNCdin"1985wa~ in contrast to a decrease of 17 per cent at the enci of 1984. ' " .' '. . ~. ",,::., -,:

, . In contrast, grO$S credit to the private sector (GCPS) de,celerated in 1985. r .QCPS which grew at 11 p~rcc!1t at end 1984 declined to 9 per cent at end1985 due largely to adecr~a~ of P ,per cent in cr-edit to co-operatives. This decrease in credit,:to

~:openttiyes thr<:>llghout 19~5 .was ,due. to. the: limited ,role played, by' the'. Paddy: Marketing Board in paddy procurement and the considerable decline-inloans~graJited, under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme during both Maha 1984/1985 and Yala 1985. '.The deceleratibn'iit eredii to· the otherpiivate sector'from 16 to'lf per cent during 1985 was largely due to the continuation of r~trictive monetary' ang:i:regit policy' ,measures introduced since March, 1984, the' sluggish demand for credit.-particularly for tea exports, and the 'deceler~tion in '. the inflation 'rate. Meanwhiie; , external assets (net) of the banking system recorded a' decluie of '7 per'Cent '~t ' end 1985 compared to a growth of 213 per cent ~t end 1984., ,

, The above changes resulted in the annUal. groWth in broad money sup~ly, (M:J declining to 11 per Cent at end 1985, compared to 17 per cent at end 1984. Despite the sharp growth in NCG, the growth in M2 was contained at this level due to a con-siderable increase (Rs. 3,627 million) in other items (net) of the :banking syst~m "in·

1985. The outstanding Central Bank securities amounting to Rs. 1,168 million at end 1985 and the revaluation of external assets of-the Central Bank were 'mainly respmisible for the increase in other items (net). 'Meanwhile. the annual growth in narrow money(M1) which had reached 14 per cent.at the end of 1984 decelerated in the first . quarter, but rose in-the next two months to reach a peak level of 20 per cent at end : May, 1985. Though M1 was erratic in the'second half of the year, at the end of 1985 it" declined to 12,p~ cent. This compares with increases of 25 and 14 per cent at the end of 1983 and 1984, respecti~ely. Reflecting -lil1'gety 'the d~eleration 'lotfe' inflation rate, income velocities of both narrow and broad money <i~clined from 8.3 and 3.2 in 1984 to' 8.0 and ~.1 respectively. in, 1985 .. : ' '

The'~eduction in deposit rates by the National Sayings Bank(NSB)" ihe excess. liquidity situation created by the credit ceilings and enhanced government expenditure induced commercial banks to reduce their deposit'rates initially and then lending rates. State banks reduced lending rates by 1 to 3 percentage points mainly on priority lendings with effect from 1st October. 1985. Despite the decline in deposit rates of commercial banks their total time and savings deposits (quasi-money) continued to rise. This may have resulted from the positive real rate of interest on financial deposits due to the deceleration in the inflation rate. Finance companies also lowered their deposit rates.

( 12 ),

In view of the drop in money market rates and the deceleration in the rate of inflation, interest rates on government securities were reduced from 16 to 14 per cent per ann1lll1 with the maturity period remaining at 6 years with effect from 1st September 1985. Similarly, the rate on primary Treasury bills fell from 14 to 11.5 percent per annum'while buying and seIling rates on secondary Treasury bills dropped from 14.2 and! 14.0- per cent per annum- to 11.5 and 11.3 per cent per annum, respectively.

The ,year ended' with the Central Bank announcing a two percentage point reduction in the Bank Rate from 13 to 11 per cent per annum and a similar reduction was effected in. all reffuance rates except those of cultivation and' marketing refinance, facilities; Following these. developments the Treasury bill rate fell to 11 per cent per annum.-

Despite the prevalence of excess liq~dity i~ the money market, there were onlY. three new share issues offering Rs. 87 million worth of shares to. the public during 1985.. The limited transactions in the share market indicates the limited availability of instruments and the lacK of an institutional framework for the transfer of resources from the money market to the capital market. .

Credit ceilings imposed on private sector credit and high reserve ratios imposed on incremental deposits of commercial banks during 1984 continued to be in force dUring 1985. With a view to absorbing excess liquidity the Central Bank increased the statutory reserve ratios on all deposits. In response-to these monetary policy measures the end year money multipliers of both narrow and broad money decreased from 1.2 and 3.1 in 1984, to 1.1 and 2.8 respectively, in 1985.

The restrictive monetary policy stance adopted in 1984 was continued togethe-r with selective policies to ensure adequate credit to priority sectors. Several measures were· adopted during 1985 with a view to providing credit to priority sectors thereby promoting the supply side in the economy. The main measures initiated, for this purpose were the exemption. of exports and agriculture loans from the credit ceilings-, reduction in refinance rates on exports and the enhancement of the liquidity base of the Development-Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC).

In June, 1985 commercial banles were permitted to maintain a part of their required reserves on time and savings deposit liabilities in DFCC bonds subject to the quantum of reserves so maintained by each commercial bank not exceeding one eighth of its reserves on time and savings deposit liabilities. This enhanced the DFCC's. capacity to lend to the private sector. At end 1985 commercial banks' investments in DFCC bonds amounted to Rs. 333 million.
