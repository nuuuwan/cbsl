This decline of 3 per cent in rupee terms or 8 per cent in SDR terms is in contrast to increases of 49 per cent and .43 per cent, respectively, in 1984. The decline of exports in 1985 was mainly due to the reduced earnings from agricultural exports from Rs. 22,575 million (SDR 866 million) in.1984 to Rs, 19,026 million.(SDR 689 million) in 1985. As a result, the share of agricultural exports in total exports declined from 60 per cent in 1984 to 52 per cent in 1985. Earnings from mineral exports increased by 27 per cent (20 per cent in SDR terms) from Rs. 923 million (SDR 35 million) to Rs. 1,177 million (SDR 43 million), while those from industrial exports increased by 9 per cent (3 per cent in SDR terms) from Rs. 12,815 million (SDR 491 million) to Rs. 13,980 million (SDR 506 million). The share of industrial exports in total exports increased from 34 per cent in 1984 to 39 per cent in 1985 due mainly to the decline in the share of agricultural exports.",

When import of ships and aircraft are excluded, the decline in the value of investment goods is greater. The decrease in investment imports in SDR terms was mainly due to decreased imports of transport equipment (22 per cent) and machinery & equipment (16 per cent), over the previous year. However, the import of building materials, which had declined by 40 per cent (in SDR terms) in 1984, increased by 16 per cent, in 1985, .",

Further, the threshold for ad-valorem tax was increased from Rs. 32.00 to Rs. 40.00 per kilogram and limited to 50 per cent of the price realised in excess of Rs. 40.00. With this change the ad-valorem duty rebate scheme was abolished.
