The higher production in low grown areas was achieved by an increase in the area under cultivation and higher yields obtained through batter cultural practices including increased fertilizer application by small holders in these areas. These improvements were made possible by booming tea prices which prevailed throughout last year and early this year. Tea production of the Janatha Estates Development Boards (JEDBs) excluding tea manufactured from bought leaf, fell marginally by 1.1 million kgs. or 2 per cent, while that of the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporations (SLSPCs) rose by 3.0 million kgs. or 5 per cent over the previous year.",

    "text": "The boom in tea prices which prevailed throughout last year ended towards the middle of 1985. The combined effect of the higher crop production in major tea producing countries, arid t h e relaxation of restrictions imposed on the Indian CTC tea exports brought about an increase in the world supply of tea leading to a fall in prices. Even the private sector small holders have begun to feel the brunt of falling prices through reduced incomes from poor green leaf prices. This situation is likely to constrain the adoption of cultural practices by them too. Notwithstanding, in view of the highly fluctuating nature of tea prices, it becomes imperative to concentrate more on productivity increases particularly1 on labour productivity in public sector estates. The wage bill accounts for bulk of their expenditure -following the wage increases-granted from time to time and if these institutions are to make their operations viable a considerable increase in output per input of labour is required. Data on the average yield per hectare for the country as a whole are not/available. However, according to the data provided by the public sector corporations, the average yield per hectare of JEDBs has decreased marginally, while that of the SLSPCs has 'increased by 6 per cent over the yield levels realized last year. The marginal.decrease in the productivity of JEBDs may have been mainly due to the slight fall observed in fertilizer application, while the increased productivity of- SLSPCs may be attributed mainly to increased -fertilizer application and favourable weather .conditions.",

This phenomenal increase in coconut production may be attributed mainly to the lagged effect of favourable weather conditions of previous years and increased fertilizer application. There were widespread rains in the main coconut producing areas most of last year and a considerable increase in fertilizer application was also observed during the last few years. The largest increase was observed in the second half of the year 1985 with the production peak being September-October.",

The increase in the extent inter-cropped with grass may have been also due to various incentives offered for dairy farming. In the intensive use of coconut land to generate additional income and employment through inter-cropping, progress has been limited. The subsidy rates, which have remained unrevised for the last several years, are an inadequate incentive in view of the increase in costs. Hence, an increase in the subsidy along with other incentives such as better access to fertilizer, extension services etc., is necessary to promote greater expansion of inter-cropping. Encouragement of dairy development projects will also help to supplement producer incomes.",

The prices of major coconut products such as coconut oil, desiccated coconut (DC), and copra towards the end of the year were less than one half of what they were at the beginning of the year. This severe fall in prices necessitated changes in the export levies on coconut products. Consequently, a duty reduction was announced in the budget as an urgent measure of relief to coconut exporters. With effect from 14th November, 1985 the export duty on D C as well as on edible copra was reduced by Rs. 2,500 per metric ton to bring the export duty on D C down from Rs. 7,500 per metric ton to Rs. 5,000 per metric ton and that on edible copra from Rs. 7,250 per metric ton to Rs. 4,750 per metric ton.",

According to provisional data, production suffered a setback in Maha 1984/85, but there was some improvement in Yala 1985, The substantial drop in the extent under most minor food crop cultivation in the.Maha season was largely responsible for the decline in production during that season. The production of chillies, red onions, groundnuts and black gram increased inspite of the reduction in the extent cultivated due to the combined effect of favourable weather conditions and increased productivity. Due to favourable weather as well as better prices for potatoes the extent under cultivation increased by 44 per cent, and production more than doubled in the Maha season. The higher production of potatoes in Maha resulted in lesser land being brought under potato cultivation in Yala, 1985. Consequently, the extent under potato cultivation fell by 19 per cent and production declined by 40 per cent The increased production of several minor food crops such as green gram, cowpea, and gingerly in the Yala season, partly compensated for the loss of production of these crops in the Maha season. Induced by higher domestic prices, larger extents of land were used for chillie cultivation, particularly in areas like Kalawewa, during the Yala. season. Consequently, the extent under chillie cultivation increased by 14 per cent.",

Increased availability of water for paddy cultivation, particularly during the Maha season, reduced the extent available for cultivation of minor food crops during that season and the reduced production of these crops in the last two years resulted in lesser seed availability for their cultivation. The conspicuous fall in the production of crops like soya bean may have been principally due to the low consumer demand.

Difficulties in obtaining labour on time resulting.in insufficient numbers being employed at the stages of planting and harvesting constitute a major problem for these two factories. Disruptions by the ethnic disturbances have exacerbated this problem recently. Kantale sugar plantations in particular are frequently affected by damages caused by animals. Hingurana sugar plantations are affected by water logging conditions which explain, to a considerable extent, the relatively lower sugar recovery rate of this factory. Low sugar recovery rates at both factories are also caused by delayed harvesting and delays in transport of sugar cane for processing to factories. This in turn is caused by the labour shortages and transport problems. Even after the sugar cane is transported to the factory, delays in processing due to failure of machinery etc. tend to lower the sugar recovery rates further. The constrained supply of spares caused by insufficient funds renders proper maintenance of machinery difficult. Underutilized capacity of machinery in operation resulting from poor yields and.low sugar cane supply causes further inefficiencies.",
