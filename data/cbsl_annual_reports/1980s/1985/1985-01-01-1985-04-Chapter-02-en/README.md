Gross National Product at current factor cost prices is estimated at Rs. 146. billion in 1985,. 6;9 per cent higher than the estimated value for 1984. When account" is taken of t h e real increase in GNP, the implicit price deflator is estimated to have increased by only 1.5 per cent, in contrast to the increase of 17.4 per cent in the previous year. This marked decline in tne rate of increase of G N P deflator can- be. attributed mainly to the decrease in export ;prices of major, agricultural products:

Sri Lanka's mid year population in 1985 has been provisionaHy estimated by the Registrar GeneraFs Department at 15.8 milhon ; a 1.5 per cent growthover, the 1984 estimate. Therefore, per capita G N P amounted to Rs. 9,219 (US$ 339). In real terms, per capita income, is- estimated to have increased-.by 3i7 per cent,, which is marginally less than the increase in 1984. •.

The deterioration of Sri Lanka's terms of trade by 22.5 per cent in 1985 resulted in the real GNP decreasing, marginally b y Q A per cent- in 1985. This is. in contrast tot an._increase.41. real G N P by-8>6 pes cent -iHr.1983 and 9.9" per cent, in: 1584owing: to an improvement in the terms of trade. ..' •

In. 1985,, the, main contributions, to economic growth, came from agriculture, manufacturing and trade, while transport and banking, also made, significant contrL-buttons, .Agricuitsure-was the racist praninent .sonic* of gft>$fth,. recovering 'front its. decline in the previous year. . •.. ;

Sectoral Performance

The sectoral growth rates for the period 1983-1985 are given in Table lv3. T h e agriculture, forestry and fishing sector, which declined marginally in 1984, grew by asrinuch as'8.6 percentih 1985. This'growth was sustained despite a slower growth df the tea sub-sector and a "negative growth in the rubber sub-sector.- The overalr growth in agriculture was mainlythe result of a phenomenal growth in the cocohdf' sub-sector and a recovery in the paddy sub-sector." The growth of-52.3 per cent lit the ccconut sub-sector is unparalleled in recent years. The 10 per cent growth -tri the paddy sector in 1985 is in contrast' td the marginal decline in 1984. The growth in other agriculture has been slower than growth in the.previous year. The fisheries sub-sector .performed.marginally better than in. the previous year. —

: The overall-growth in the manufacturing sector decreased from 1273' per cent in 1984 to 5.2 per cent in 1985, mainly as a resultof the'sharp drop in factory industry* growth from 15.0 per cent to 5.0 per cent.

The mining and quarrying'sector maintained a 1.5 per cent growth rate in 1985. Slow growth in construction and a decline 'in gem exports mainly account for this-low rate of growth. • ' • - . - -

The transport, storage-and* communication sectior recorded "a; reduced growth rate of 4.2 per cent in-1985. Value added in wholesale *and-retail trade grew at a lower rate than in the preceding year, mainly as a result of negative growth in the exports sub-sector. The growth of the imports sub-sector was higher than in the previous year. Value added in the banking, insurance and real estate sector recorded agrowthrate of 9.9percentin 1985. •• i

Both, ownership of dwellings and public administration had decreased, rates of growth of 1.5 per cent and 6.4 per cent respectively, while the services sector, which continued to b'eaftected by the decline in the tourist industry, declined by 4.7 per cent.

Expenditure Pattern , ,

The rate of expansion of Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) continued to slow, down. The GDE growth rate in 1985 was 10.0 per cent compared with growth rates of 16.4 per cent.in 1984 and 18.6 per cent in 1983.

The GDE at current market prices in 1985 is estimated at Rs. 179 billion, which is a n increase of Rs. 16:3 billion over the previous year. Private consumption expenditure increased by 10.7 per cent to reach Rs. 123.2 billion in 1985. , Of this figure, the-expenditure, on foreign goods and non- factor services was Rs. 27 billion—an increase of 24.3 per cent over the previous year. The expenditure "on locally produced goods at Rs. 96.2 billion was an increase of 7.4 per cent over that of the previous year. Public sector consumption expenditure increased by. 23,4 per cent over the previous year., ,,

' Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF), which includes changes in stocks, increased by'only 4.1 per cent as compared with a growth of 13.0 per cent.in the preceding, year. Capital formation" in the private sector and public corporations together decreased by 7.3 per cent, in contrast to a growth of 11 -8 per cent in 1984. In the government1 sector,'gross capital formation which' increased by 18.9 per "cent in the previous year, increased by 57.3 per cent in 1985.

Gross Domestic Fixed Capital JFormation (GDFCF) increased by 3.9 per cent compared to an increase of 11.9 per cent in the; previous year. The total value of imported investment goods decreased by 17.1 percent in 1985 as compared with an increase of. 5.0 per cent in 1984. _ The imports of capital goods, excluding ships and aircraft decreased by 25.1 per cent in the current year. The import content of Gross Domestic Fixed CapitaLFomatiori was 23.1 per cent in 1985 and 28.9 per cent in 1984.

This sharpdecrease in imported investment "goods is in contrast to an increase of 5 per cent in 1984. The lower import content of capital expenditure was parti­cularly due to the completion ofiieadworks-oftfaB^ahaweli scheme which resulted in a large reduction in capital goods imports. i • | ,

Of the Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation,, 73.2 per cent was within the private 'sector and public corporations. This is somewhat lower than its component in 1984. As in 1984 the largest share of capital formation occurred in building and jjrther construction.-The capital formation at current prices jin this sub-sector increased by 4.1 percent in 1985, compared with' an increase of 14 per Cent in 1984. Capifal formation in plant and machinery, transport equipment jand other capital goods declined in 1985. The only other increase mcapitaLformation was aft increase of 321 per cent in land development and replantihg. • j

Availability and Utilization of Resources. . * :

Of the total resources of Rs. 221.3, billion available tp the Sri Lankan economy in 1985, Rs. 159.8 billion (72.2 per cent) was from domestic sources and Rs. 61.5 bilhon (27.8 per cent) was from imports.

While 18.7 per cent of resources was expended on capital formation, 62.3 per cent was spent on consumption and 19.0 per cent on the exports of goods and non factor services. The comparable figures for 1984 were 19 per cent on capital formation, 59.5 per cent on consumption and 21«4»per cent o n exports of goe&s and non-factor services* •• •• -•- ' j i -. ! •"

Total resources valued at 1978 prices are estimated to have increased by 4.7 per cent in 1985 in comparison to an increase of 3.7 per cent in the previous year. Import of goods and non-factor services, which increased; marginally by 0.7 per cent in 1984, increased by 4.1 per cent in 1985. Total consumption, which increased by 1.5 per cent w 1984, increased by 2.2 per-cent in 1985. Gross domestic fixed capital formation which increased by 1.2 per cent in 1984J increased by 2.0 per cent.

Domestic savings declined by 28.3 per cent in the current year from Rs. 30.6 billion in 1984 to Rs. 21.9 billion in 1985. This is in contrast to both 1983 and 1984, wherein significant increases were observed in domestic savings. As a ratio of GDP at market prices, domestic savings were 13.7 per cent in 1985 in contrast to the 1984 ratio of 19.9 per1 cent. Total'national savings^ which include net foreign factor income and private transfer's decreased by 24.6 per cent to reach-an estimated value of Rs. 25.8 billion in 1985. The national savings to GDP ratio fell from 22.2 per cent in 1984 to 16;1 per cent in-1985.'<
