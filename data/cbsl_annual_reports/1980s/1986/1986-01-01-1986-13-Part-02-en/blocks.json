The highest volume of loans given previously was in 1985 when the banking system granted Rs. 36.8 million for paddy during Yala 1985. The loans granted under the NCRCS enjoy a guarantee cover of upto 50 per cent. Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies also started lending to farmer members under this scheme. This is. the first time that these'Societies have parti\u00adcipated in a loan scheme sponsored.by the banking system.. The other features of this scheme such as the line of credit for cultivation for three years and the roll-over facility in respect of the rescheduled loans of non-wilful defaulters were well received by the banks as well as farmers. The new reporting system incorporated in the NCRCS facilitated the computerisation of data pertaining to the grant and recovery of cultivation loans. The Bank was able to get a satisfactory feedback on the oper\u00adation of this credit scheme and give the lending banks a detailed analysis of the distribution'of loans geographically as well as by various types of borrowers in a short period of time. The monitoring system has helped the Central Bank in the effective implementation of the roll-over.facility under which the Bank provides refinance for rescheduling cultivation loans of non-wilful defaulters.",

The Wet-Zone Farm Machinery Loan Scheme, introduced in 1985, has shown remarkable progress and in view of the increased demand for farm power equipment the scheme was extended to all the districts in the island in 1986. The scheme was re-designated as the All-Island Farm Machinery Loan Scheme. The Credit Scheme to Assist Settlers in the Mahaweli Project Area for Purchase of Traqtors was terminated in 1986 and the unutilised balance of refinance funds amounting to Rs. 49 million that had been allocated by the Central Bank for this scheme was transferred to refinance the All-Island Farm Machinery Loan Scheme. The expansion of this scheme to cover the entire island was necessitated because many Integrated Rural Development (IRD) projects and the ADB-Sri Lanka Rural Credit Project which catered to the require\u00adments for farm power in several districts of the country came to an end or were drawing a close in the first half of 1986.",

The number of deposit accounts as well as the amount mobilized increased in 1986, the first complete year of operations of the banks, mainly due to the expansion of the branch network from 17 to 32. The RRDBs have attempted to mobilize savings, by and large, in the form of small savings from the people of the area. A salient feature in the banking operations of RRDBs was therefore the relatively small size of the deposits especially the savings deposits, as illustrated by Table 2.11.",

Almost all branches of the RRDBs had organised a number of meetings in villages in their respective command areas (Jana-hamuwa) during the year with the purpose of explaining the objectives of the RRDB scheme and its role in the development of the rural economy. A large number of people were able to obtain loans as a result of these meetings. Efforts were also made by banks to collect deposits at the meetings themselves and arrange to deliver the pass book to the depositors at their residences subsequently. Besides, some RRDBs have implemented 'mobile banking services' for the public who need such facilities in places where banks do not carry out these services regularly.",

The Regional Office together with the officials of the Agricultural Insurance Board continued close surveillance over cultivation activities from the commencement of sowing upto the harvesting period. The repayment rate in respect of 1985/86 Maha stood at around 90 per cent, while the corresponding rate for 1986 Yala was 95 per cent. The most encouraging aspect of this scheme was that it attempted to bring about close contact with the farmers and improve their Hying standards by enabling them to obtain increased yields. Table 2.19 shows ;a breakdown of the paddy cultivation loans on an electoral basis during the respective seasons.",
