Unfavourable weather conditions that adversely affected food production, disruption of transport facilities in the upcountry areas, and the reversal of the declining trend in the prices of coconut and coconut products were some of the important factors. In addition, the full impact of the budgetary measures introduced in November, 1985 such as the higher guaranteed price for paddy, the levy of duty on imported textiles, the increase in excise duty on tobacco and alcohol and higher postal rates, was also felt in 1986. However, stability in fuel and energy prices during the year helped to' contain inflation to some extent. Also, the restrictive credit policies which were operative in 1985 and continued in 1986, and open market operations for mopping-up excess liquidity would have contributed towards controlling aggregate demand, thereby easing greater pressure on prices.",

As a result of greater demand in the world market, coconut prices rose in the last few months of the year. Higher fish and vegetable prices also contributed to the rise in the sub-index for food.

A significant feature of the new structure was the reduction of the number of salary scales that existed. Corresponding, to each salary, scale, there now exists eighteen incremental steps operating in,three segments. With the,new scales coming into effect, an additional increment was granted to all officers whose initial salary corres\u00adponded to the initial salary of the new salary scales., In addition, one increment was granted for each two year period of stagnation for those at the .maximum, of their salary scales.
