    "text": "A primary concern of budgetary policy should be the maintenance of fiscal decipline for achieving satisfactory growth consistence with price stability. With this end in view, the Budget for 1986 originally estimated a deficit of Rs. 26,986 million or 15 per cent of GDP. However, several unfavourable developments such as depressed commodity prices and a higher level of expenditure on national security threatened to thwart the achievement of fiscal targets in 1986. In this background, the originally estimated budget deficit was revised upward to Rs. 28,671 million in November, 1986. However, despite the pessimism that emerged in the budgetary scene earlier on, provisional data for 1986 as available now revealed an overall budget deficit of Rs. 25,596 million which was lower than the original estimate. In relation to GDP, the deficit was 14.3 per cent, as against 15.8 per cent in 1985. Thus, fiscal performance in 1986 appeared to show some improvement over 1985.",

    "text": "Improved fiscal performance was due to several factors. Despite the reduction in government revenue from income taxes, export duties and turnover taxes from manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities, overall revenue increased, owing to enhanced collections from import duties, excise duties and non-tax revenue. Meanwhile, the recurrent expenditure growth declined from 17 per cent in 1985 to 3 per cent in 1986 owing to a slowing down in expenditure growth on account of transfer payments and other goods and services. Advance account operations which had to be financed outside normal budgetary provisions in recent years also showed a marked improvement.",

    "text": "In presenting the Budget for 1987, the Government re-affirmed its commitment to reduce the budget deficit through a medium term policy framework which recog\u00adnised the need for consistency in strategy for correcting structural weaknesses in the economy. In terms of this programme, the budget deficit is expected to decline from 11 per cent of GDP in 1987 to 9 per cent in 1989. In the medium term policy framework for 1987-1989, government revenue is expected to remain at 20 per cent of GDP, while expenditure is expected to be reduced progressively from 31 per cent of GDP in 1987 to 29 per cent in 1989. Within these limits, recurrent epxend-diture/GDP ratio is expected to be maintained at 18.5 per cent throughout the period 1987-1989. Hence, the gradual reduction in the budget deficit is expected to be achieved through a progressive reduction in capital expenditure from 12.5 per cent of GDP in 1987 to 10.5 per cent in 1989. These targets are to be achieved through a series of measures which would improve financial control, as well as reduce commitments.",

The substantial growth in receipts from these items was due to the upward revision of excise duties in November, 1985.
