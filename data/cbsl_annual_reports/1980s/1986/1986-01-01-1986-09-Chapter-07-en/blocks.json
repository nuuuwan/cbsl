This was 3 per cent higher in SDR terms compared with the deficit of Rs. 14,034 million (SDR 508 million) recorded in 1985. When customs data are adjusted for lags and other factors pertaining to recording, total imports amounted to Rs. 54,609 million (SDR 1,660 million) while exports totalled Rs. 34,072 million (SDR 1,036 million). The resulting adjusted trade deficit of Rs. 20*537 million (SDR 624 million) was 3 per cent lower in SDR terms than the previous year's adjusted deficit of Rs. 17,843 million (SDR 646 million).",

This was somewhat similar to the performance of the export sector in the previous year when export earnings dropped by 3 per cent in Rupee terms and by 8 per cent in SDR terms in comparison with 1984. The drop in export earnings in 1986 was due mainly to reduced earnings from agricultural exports which declined from Rs. 19,026 million (SDR 689 million) in 1985 to Rs. 15,764 million (SDR 479 million). Earnings from industrial exports too declined in SDR terms, largely due to a sharp reduction in petroleum exports, falling from SDR 517 million in 1985 to SDR 483 million in 1986. In Rupee terms, however, industrial exports recorded an increase, rising from Rs. 14,295 million to Rs. 15,878 million over the two year period. Mineral exports at Rs. 1,182 million (SDR 36 million) registered an increase of 37 per cent (15 per cent in SDR terms) in 1986, recording a most impressive growth, but due to the smaller share in total exports, its impact on the overall export sector was very marginal,",

Although on the import side, petroleum prices dropped sharply and the prices of a number of basic food items also declined, the favourable impact of these were less than sufficient to avoid the country's terms of trade from remaining adverse for the second consecutive year. Export prices, measured by the export price index, decreased by 11 per cent during the year while import prices measured by import price index decreased by 6 per cent. Thus, the relative movements in prices resulted in a deterioration in the terms of trade and the index decreased by 5 per cent, declining from 108 in 1985 to 102 in 1986.",

However, the growth in both garments and textile exports and in other industrial exports was negated by a sharp drop in the value of petroleum exports, which declined by 39 per cent (49 per cent in SDR terms) from Rs. 3,877 million (SDR 140 million) in 1985 to Rs. 2,358 million (SDR 72 million) in 1986.

The share of consumer goods which rose from 23 per cent in 1984 to 26 per cent in 1985, increased further to 34 per cent in 1986. This was partly the outcome of increased importation of consumer goods for meeting domestic consumption requirements as well as for the building-up of buffer stocks. The share of intermediate goods in total imports dropped further to 41 per cent from 47 per cent in 1985. The reduction in the share of intermediate goods can be mainly attributed to the substantial decline in the value of petroleum imports, due to the decline in world prices of oil. The share of investment goods increased marginally, to 19.3 per cent from 19.2 per cent in the previous year.

Expenditure on intermediate goods such as petroleum, wheat grain and fertilizer decreased con\u00adsiderably. The value of petroleum imports at Rs. 6,293 million (SDR 191 million) was less than half that of the previous year, largely on account of the sharp fall in the world price of crude oil, from around SDR 28 per barrel in 1985 to around SDR 13 per barrel in 1986. The volume of crude oil imports also declined marginally from 12.2 million barrels in 1985 to 12.1 million barrels in 1986.
