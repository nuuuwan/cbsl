    "text": "A significant decline in the rate of growth of broad money supply (M2) caused by a decline in external banking assets (net) and reduced expansion in domestic credit was the main feature of monetary developments in 1986. The narrow money supply (M,) consisting of currency and demand deposits held by the public increased by Rs. 2,418 million or 13 per cent compared with an increase of Rs. 1,937 million or 12 per cent in 1985. Meanwhile, time and savings deposits of the private sector held with commercial banks (quasi-money) increased marginally by Rs. 33 million. Consequently, in 1986 the broad money supply (M 2) defined to include M, plus quasi-money rose by Rs. 2,451 million or 5 per cent which was less than half the growth observed during the previous year of Rs. 4,982 million or 11 per cent.",

    "text": "The increase in M, during the year was mainly on account of a rise in currency holdings of the public by Rs. 1,754 million or 18 per cent. This compared with an increase of Rs. 1,255 million or 15 per cent in 1985. Following the trend observed in 1985, the highest monthly increase in currency holdings was in March when a 9 per cent rise was recorded, reflecting the enhanced demand for cash prior to the April festive season. Meanwhile, demand deposits held by the public rose by Rs. 664 million or 7 per cent in 1986 compared with an increase of Rs. 683 million or 8 per cent in 1985. Consequently, the share of demand deposits in M| declined further from 48 per cent as at the end of 1985 \"to 45 per cent by the end of 1986. The relatively high growth in the currency component of the money supply is a pheno\u00admenon observed since 1984 and this is partly explained by the inability of the public to enjoy unrestricted banking services in some parts of the Northern and Eastern provinces.",

The lack of growth in quasi-money was largely due to a decline in time and savings deposits of government corporations by Rs. 1,067 million or 18 per cent in 1986% Two institutions which recorded significant decreases in such deposits were the State Plantations Corporation (SPC) and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The deposits of the SPC declined mainly due to the drop in tea prices, while those of the CEB decreased sharply due to the withdrawal of funds for investment in the Govern ment Treasury bill market.",

The diminished growth in quasi-money of the OPSC could be attributed, among other factors, to the lack of buoyancy in the export sectors and restricted availability of banking services in certain areas in the Northern and Eastern provinces. However, the time u i d savings deposits of co-operative institutions increased by Rs. 69 million or 11 per cent in 1986.",

    "text": "Since external banking assets (net) declined during the year, the most significant contributory factor for the growth of money supply in 1986 was the increase in domestic credit (DC) which rose by Rs. 4,883 million or 8 per cent. In comparison, DC in 1985 increased by a much larger magnitude of Rs. 9,300 million or 19 per cent. The deceleration in domestic credit expansion was caused by the reduced growth in both net credit to government (NCG) and gross credit to private sector (GCPS). In 1986, NCG grew by Rs. 2,198 million or 11 per cent, as against a much sharper increase of Rs. 5,793 million or 40 per cent in 1985. However, despite the reduced growth, the share of NCG in total DC which rose from 29 per cent in 1984 to 34 per cent in 1985 increased further to 35 per cent in 1986. This was largely due to a relatively low growth in private sector credit during the year. The rise in NCG in 1986 was the combined outcome of an increase in gross credit to the government of Rs. 1,941 million or 8 per cent and a decrease in government deposits and cash balances by Rs. 257 million or 5 per cent. In 1986, credit extended by the Central Bank to government increased by Rs. 2,085 million or 9 per cent, as compared with a much sharper increase of Rs. 7,511 million or 49 per cent in the previous year. The recourse to government borrowings from the Central Bank consisted of an increase of Rs. 406 million in provisional advances and a rise pf Rs. 1,679 million in the hold\u00adings of government and government guaranteed securities. Meanwhile, credit to government by commercial banks declined by Rs. 144 million or 5 per cent during the year. The low recourse of the Government to the banking system in 1986 was made possible by a considerable increase in Treasury bill holdings of the non-bank private sector which rose from Rs. 1,659 million as at the end of 1985 to Rs. 3,909 million as at the end of 1986. In addition, the transfer of the Central Bank profits of Rs. 1,779 million in February, 1986 reduced the need to borrow from the banking system.",

    "text": "Reflecting a weak demand for inter-bank funds, the operations in the inter-bank call money market recorded, very modest growth in 1986. The outstanding lendings in this market rose from Rs. 287 million at the end of 1985 to Rs. 316 million by the end of 1986. Meanwhile, the lending rates fluctuated within a range of 9.5 to 14 per cent per annum. The comparative range in 1985 was 11 to 15 per cent per annum. The lower demand for inter-bank funds induced the commercial banks to rely on other short-term investment outlets to dispose of their excess funds, of which a substantial portion was diverted to the secondary Treasury bill market (STBM). The outstanding net sales in the STBM fluctuated between Rs. 1,168 million and Rs. 2,622 million during the year. Meanwhile, commercial bank investments in Central Bank securities rose from Rs. 890 million at the end of 1985 to Rs. 1,905 million by the end of 1986.",

There were several reasons for the lower utilization of credit by the priority sectors. First, the slump in tradi\u00adtional export prices reduced the demand for export credit in nominal terms, especially pre-shipment credit. Second, there was a delay in the implementation of the Medium Term Investment Programme for the state-owned plantation sector.

In addition, the considerable rise in the sub-index for clothing of the CCPI in late 1985 and the increases in excise duty on arrack, beer and tobacco also contributed for price increases in 1986.
