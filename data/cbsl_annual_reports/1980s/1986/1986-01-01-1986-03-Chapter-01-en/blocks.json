When allowance is ma\u00a2e for net fector income from abr~ad, the Gross National Product (GNP) at constant (1982) prices recorded a growth rate of 4.5 pet cent. The marginally higher GNP growth rate over GDP growth was due to reduced outflows on account of net f~.ctor income from abroad in 1986 than in the previous year. This resulted from a reduction in interest pay~ents abroad on foreign loans following the downward movement of interest rates in international ma.rkets during the year. . .' .",

After allowing for this increase, per capita GNP at current prices rose to Rs. 9,918 (US $ 354) in 1986. In real terms, per capita income 'increased by 2.7 per cent, as against a riEe of 3.7 per cent in the previous year.

Foremost among them were the adverse weather conditions that affected production, disruption of tra.nsport facilities in certa.in areas causing supply bottlenecks and the reversal of the declining trend in the price of coconut and coconut products following the international market trends during the closing months of 1986. In addition, the full impact of the budgetary measures introduced in November, 1985 such as the higher guaranteed price for paddy, the levy of duty for imported textiles, the increase in excise duty on tobacco and alcohol and higher posta] rates was also felt in 1986. A further factor was the depreciation of the exchange rate against most currencies which pushed up import prices in terms of domestic currency. However, the stabi-lity of fuel and energy prices during the year helped to contain inflation to some extent. There was also that much less pressure from the demand side, with the continuance of a stringent monetary policy by the Central Ba.nk, the main thrust of which during the year being the Bank's action in the ?rea of open market operations for siphoning off excess liquidity.",

Although earnings from rubber and minor agricultural products registered marginal increases in Rupee terms, the earnings decreased by 14 and 8 per cent, respectively in SDR terms.

However, with growin,g success at increasing the country's domestic food production, particularly after the green revolu~ion, the country was able to reduce the volume of consumer goods imports thereby contributing to a more flexible\u00b7 and development oriented import structure. Thus, by 1984 the share of consumer goods imports, excluding wheat grain,' in total imports had de9lined to 23 per cent, with corresponding increases in the share of intermediate goods and investment goods which together account~d for 16 per ceni in thit year. However, in 1985 there ,was a reversal of this trend when the share of consumer goods in tot~.l imports increased to 26 per cent. In 1986, there was a further setback on this score",

The country was not able to reap the full benefit of-depressed commodity prices in the international market as high import volumes had to be maintained for the purpose of buffer stock building. In addition, as in the previous year, defence related imports exerted heavy pressure on th~ balance of payments. The most discouraging exper-ience, however, was the depressed commodity prices which affected the country's principal agricultural exports almost throughout the year. The tourist industry which had been one of the victims of the continuing civil disturbances in the country failed to show any signs of recovery during the year. On the other hand, the country's external debt commitments tended to remain high partly due to heavy recourse to commercial borrowings in recent years. The sum total of these developments was the continuing pressure on the exchange rate. and a further drawing down of external assets during the year.",

First, despite reduced collections from a number of taxes, the overall revenue of the . government was maintained at a high level owing to higher receipts from import duties, excise duties and non-tax revenue. Second, the growth in recurrent expendi-ture was kept to a minimum in the midst of competing claims for higher levels of expenditure from several fronts. These two situations were conducive to producing a better fiscal out-turn on the curr~nt.accourit. Accordingly, the current account of the budget was in s'urplus to the tune of Rs. 1,353 million in 1986. In comparison, the surplus on current account in'1985 was Rs. 4,854 million. In view of this",

It also underscores the extent of addi-,tional fiscal effort that is required to continue to absorb th.e same volume of resources by way of government revenue, particularly in a situation when such revenue is becoming extremely sensitive to developments in the external sector. For instance, in 1986 revenue collection from exports declined by 16 per cent, while those from tea export duty alone decreased by 21 per cent. At the same time, although the volume of coconut exports expanded by 18 per cent, export duty collections declined by a third. '",

Consequently, the share of demand deposits in MI declined further from 48 per cent at the end of 1985 to as low as 45 per cent by the end of 1986-a disturb-ing development for a country which had been endeavouring to popularise banking for many years. The currency/deposit ratio in MI had been hovering around 50 per cent for a considerable length of time. The perverse development in the currency/deposit ratio in MI in recent years can, however, be considered a temporary phenomenon arising from the inability of the public to enjoy unrestricted banking services in some parts of the country due to the civil unrest.",

Apparently, there has been a pronounced shift in the attractiveness of bank deposits as a form of investment. The slow growth in quasi money was the combined outcome of a reduction in the deposits of government corporations and diminished growth in the deposits of the other private sector constituents (OPSC).",

    "text": "Increased reliance by the government on bank credit had been a major destabi-lizing factor in the monetary and credit scene in recent years. The year 1986 saw a significant departure from this trend. The low recourse on the part of the govern-ment to the banking system in 1986 was made possible by a, reduction in the overall budget defici~, on the one hand, and a considerable increase in, financing from the non-bank sector, on the' other. For instance, Treasury bill holdings of the non-b,ank sector rose from Rs. 1,659 million as at the end of 1985 to Rs. 3,909 million at the end of 1986-a net increase of Rs. 2,250 million. In addition, the transfer of the Central Bank profits amounting to Rs. '1,779 million in February ]986 alw helped the government to reduce its borrowings from the banking system. Thus, in part the reduced'recourse to the banking system by the government in 1986 was achieved by a considerable diversion of funds otherwise availabl~ to the private sector-a development conducive to maintaining price stability but perhaps involving adverse implications for the private sector.",

Among the deposit taking institutions, while the National Savings Bank (NSB) effected marginal downward adjustments in its deposit rates, the commercial banks and finance companies lowered their rates by significant margins.

However, in actual practice the decreases in the lending rates of commercial banks were not only marginal but also were largely confined to lending rates in the priority sectors. This downward rigidity in the movement of lending rates of commercial banks was, no doubt, a matter for concern in a situation when there was considerable excess liquidity in the banking system .. However, noteworthy reductions were observed in the lending rates of long term credit institutions. The State Mortgage and Investment Bank! reduced its interest rate on all categories of loans by 2 percentage points, while the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon also effected a down-ward reduction in its lending rates granted outside refinance schemes from a range of 14 to 21 per cent per annum to a range of 14 to 18 per cent per annum.",

While the Bank continued to issue its own securities for absorbing excess liquidity in the economy, facilities available under certain refin-ance schemes were increased in order to further expand the availability of credit to priority sectors at concessionary rates. At the same time, some of the quantitative credit restrictions imposed in early 1984 were relaxed, with a view to providing a greater market orientation to monetary policy. Among the policy measures intro-duced for promoting activities in the productive sectors of the economy were the reduction of refinance rates of the Central Bank, enhancing the quantum of refinance avaiJable under certain facilities, extension of the period for which refinance is avai-lable for traditional and non-traditional exports, exemption of commercial bank credit to the private sector for industrial purposes from the credit ceilings of May 1984 and the withdrawal of the requirement to maintain special reserves under the Reserve Tranche System. The last -mentioned measure was with a view to inducing commercial banks to reduce their lending rates.",

The most significant feature in the credit scene in 1986 was the reduced level of credit utilization in relation to Credit PIan estimates. There were se\\'eral reasons for the lower utilization of credit by the priority sectors. First, the slump in traditional export prices reduced the d(:mand for credit in nominal terms for trading purposes. Second, there was the delay in the implementation of the medium term investment programme for the state owned plantation sector.

Containment of the budget deficit is all the more neces~ary as such deficits invariably have adverse eff-ects on the balance of payments. In the context of Sri Lanka's current problems, the need is for a relative shift of resources away from large deficits into the production of goods and services that remain internationally competitive. In an environment of a deteriorating world economic situation where economic activity remains sluggish and subd ued and which is further aggravated by weak commodity prices and unfavour-able terms of trade, all of which tend to dampen economic growth in Sri Lanka, large fiscal deficits would not only exert further pressures on the balance of payments, the exchange rate and domestic prices, but also would postpone the urgent need to make structural adjustments. Though Sri Lanka has been able to achieve a consi-derable degree of diversification of its economic structure, yet the narrow concen-tration on a few products for export had been a major structural problem which had continuously aggravated the balance: of payments situation.",

However, the flow of external resources to supplement the low level of domestic sa\\'ings has been satisfactory. The importance of foreign capital to achieve a high rate of economic growth through higher investment and technology transfers carinot be overemphasized. Foreign capital can allow Sri Lanka to adjust to new circuni.:. stances in the world economy as well as unleash the development potential.

In order to strengthen and sustain growth through adjustment policies, the flow of concessional aid and technology transfers will have t() be auS-mented and directed towards productive investment.",

    "text": "Cons:quently, increasing amounts of foreign exchange earnings currently being generated are required to be set aside for servicing the foreign debt. Sri Lanka's debt service ratio, which is an index considered to be a good guide to a country's external debt problem, accordingly registered an upward trend reflecting both the increased volume of debt, as well as the stringent commercial terms applicable mostly to borrowings of public sector corporations. Though the total debt has reached a high proportion of GDP, it is still within manageable limits. In 1986 total deb service payments (inclusive of payments to the IMP) as a ratio of earnings from goods and services stood at 26.3 per cent. The overall debt service ratio, that is, debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from merchandise exports, ~ervices and private transfers amounted to 21.9 per cent. An improvement of this position to reduce the debt service burden is essential to provide adequate support for orderly economic growth consistent with a high rate of return on investments. Both the public and private sectors need to take timely and constructive action to incresase out-put. Maintenance of a strong external position through appropriate and adequate policy measures seems imperative to ensure a continuing movement towards a reduction of destabilizing forces and maintenance of a high rate of economic growth. This is all the more important since the changes in the economic environment have reduced the prospects for foreign capital flows especially those of a concessional character. It is hard to visualize how Sri Lanka could escape from the harsh realities of these adverse winds blowing from the international scene.",

    "text": "Faced with a hostile external environment, Sri Lanka's economic options appear \u00b0to be getting increasingly narrower. Given the paucity of savings and the small size of the domestic market, Sri Lanka has necessarily to continue to depend on foreign savings for augmenting capital formation. On the other hand, if she fails to follow correct domestic policies, the confidence that underlies the flows of foreign savings could soon wane. Faced with this dilemma, the accent in economic policy in the immediate future should be directed at correcting economic fundamentals, for which purpose a huge dose of fiscal restraint would no doubt be necessary. In this regard, processes are already in train that should help correct major imbalances that had been plaguing the economy. In presenting the Budget for 1987, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to reduce the budget deficit through a medium-term policy framework which recognized the need for consistency in strategy for correcting structural weaknesses in the economy. In terms of this programme, the budget deficit is expected to decline from 11 per cent of GDP in 1987 to 9 per cent in 1989. This is to be achieved through a series of measures aimed at improving financial control and economizing on commitments. Government must follow up the steps already taken and must make further changes where necessary, that will ensure a continuing movement towards budgetary balance. Such action will contri-bute to bolstering confidence in Sri Lanka's endeavours at economic advancement with international support.",
