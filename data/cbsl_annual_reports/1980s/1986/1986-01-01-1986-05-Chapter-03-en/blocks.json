High grown tea production fell by 1.7 million kgs. or 2 per cent while the medium grown tea production fell by 1.9 million kgs. or 3 per cent. In' contrast, low grown tea production, which accounted for the highest relative share in total tea production for the second year in succession, rose marginally by 0.8 million kgs. .",

    "text": "The fall in output was reflected mainly in the state owned plantations. The combined output of the Janatha Estates Development Boards (JEDBs) and the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporations (SLSPCs) fell by 4 per cent in 1986. Consequently, their relative share in total tea production fell from 70 per cent in 1985 to 68 per cent in 1986. Tea. production of the JEDBs at 74 million kgs. was. 5 per cent lower than that of 1985, while the production of the SLSPCs at 71 million kgs. was 3 per cent lower. Tea manufactured by the JEDBs from own leaf fell by 4 per cent to 69 million kgs. while that of the SLSPCs fell by 2 per cent to 58 niiliion kgs. Tea produced from bought leaf which forms about 6 per cent of the JEDBs' total production fell by 0.6. million kgs. or 11 per cent, while that of the SLSPCs: which constitutes a relatively higher percentage of about 18 per cent, fell by 0.9 million kgs. or 7 per cent. Tea manufactured in the private sector estates rose marginally by 2 per cent, which may have resulted from the increased intake of green leaf from small holder dominated low grown areas. If the manufactured bought leaf tea component of the JEDBs and SLSPCs is included under private sector pro\u00adduction, the share of the private sector in total tea production rose from 38 per cent in 1985 to 39 per cent in 1986.",

    "text": "Evidently, poor prices which prevailed throughout most of 1985 and 1986 adversely affected the cultural practices including fertilizer application. The lower output in JEDBs was largely due to a decrease in the average yield resulting from a substantial drop in fertilizer application, unfavourable weather conditions parti\u00adcularly in the high and mid grown areas and a marginal decline in the extent in bearing. Despite a higher average yield as a result of increased fertilizer application per unit of land, the output of the SLSPCs declined mainly due to unfavourable weather conditions and reduced extent in bearing consequent on uprooting for replanting. Less productive old seedling teas found in most of the state owned plantations would also have contributed to.the lower output. The marginal increase in the output of low grown areas was to some extent due to relatively higher pro\u00adductivity of tea in these areas and coarse plucking. Particularly, the small-holders have resorted to this practice to increase the sales volume in order to make up for the reduced revenue consequent on depressed prices.",

In relation to the progress envisaged in replanting under the Medium Term Investment Programme (MTIP), the performance of the public sector plantations fell below expectations. This was particularly true in the case of SLSPCs which were expected to replant about 1,000 hectares in 1986 under this programme. The poor performance may have been largely due to liquidity constraints faced by these institutions as a result of depressed prices and their consequent inability to meet their commitments to the programme. Some improvement was seen in private sector tea replanting, since the administration of replanting subsidies in this sector was entrusted to the Tea Small-Holdings Development Authority. However, the cumulative extent replanted up to the end of 1986 still constituted only about 21 per cent of the total registered extent under tea in this sector.

It was concentrated mainly in the small-holder dominated low grown areas where there is greater potential for expanding the area under cultivation of tea compared with the other sectors.

The SLSPCs and JEDBs, however, reported declines in fertilizer application as in the previous year. The quantity of fertilizer used by the JEDBs fell by 605 metric tons or 16 per cent while that of the SLSPCs fell by 1,096 metric tons or 14 per cent over the previous year. Liquidity problems faced by these two corporations appear to have been the main factor for the reduced use of fertilizer. It was therefore noteworthy that the increased fertilizer application was almost entirely confined to the private sector estates. This, in turn, largely reflected the fertilizer use on immature plants induced by the rubber subsidy programme.",

The estimated production in 1986 at 3,041 million nuts is the highest level ever recorded and is 3 per cent higher than that of the previous year. This continued rise in output was largely due to the lagged effect of increased fertilizer application in the recent past and the favourable weather. Even though the fertilizer application fell in 1985 over that of 1984, it remained at a relatively higher level when compared with the three-year period immediately preceding 1984. The relatively higher level of fertilizer application in 1985 may also have influenced the production in 1986 as well. Production peaked during the first half of the year and was about 24 per cent higher than that of the corresponding period in 1985 while",

The replanting subsidy paid for cocoa at Rs. 26,440 per hectare was almost four times the subsidy paid previously, while that paid for cardamom at Rs. 24,710 per hectare was more than six times. Similar increases were made in the subsidies paid under the Assistance Scheme for Minor Export Crops Processing Units with a view to increasing capacity and upgrading the quality of processing. Further, to encourage monocropping, extents of over 1.2 hectares were paid an additional 50 per cent of the existing subsidy. However, in the case of mixed cropping too, an additional 25 per cent of the existing subsidy was paid but was confined to extents of 1.2 hectares and below on any single permit.",

Substantial production losses were recorded in Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Kilinochchi, Jaffna and Vavuniya. A decline of about 20 per cent in the area cultivated, a higher incidence of crop failure of about 23 per cent of the gross extent sown (as against 5 per cent in the previous year) and breach of the Kantale dam which affected the paddy cultivation particularly in the Trincomalee district were the major reasons for the low output in these areas. However, the decline in Maha production in these areas was partly offset by a significant expansion in production in other areas of the country, due largely to sub3tantially higher fertilizer application under favourable weather conditions.",

    "text": "With new lands coming under paddy cultivation, partici larly in areas under the Accelerated Mahaweli Scheme, with an assured supply of irrigation water, there are prospects of a surplus in paddy production emerging in the near future. In such an event, with virtually no arrangements for export of rice, paddy prices are very likely to fall sharply, depressing producer margins. The dilemma of assuring a reasonable income to paddy farmers in this context will pose a challenge to the country. One way of coming to grips with this problem would be to encourage greater domestic consumption of rice through the adjustment of relative prices of rice and wheat flour, and popularizing rice-based products as substitutes. Another feasible measure from the view point of efficient allocation of resources would be the diversion of marginal paddy lands for the cultivation of other crops or for other uses. Further, the breeding and popularizing of new varieties of rice that are in good demand in international markets appears to be a worth while experiment.",

    "text": "In overall terms, the performance of the fisheries sector has been below expectations with the output remaining considerably short of what is required for meeting domestic consumption requirements. Inadequate supply in the face of rising demand resulted in an increase of prices of all varieties of fish over the past few years. The prices of most of the popular varieties rose by more than 10 per cent in 1986 over the prices in the previous year. However, the difference between the producer and consumer prices remained rather modest during the year indicating that there was heavy competition which assured a better price to producers. Mean\u00adwhile, the high fuel cost appears to be one of the major contributory factors for the high cost of production in the marine fisheries sector which supplies bulk of the output. The fisheries development policy should therefore focus attention on less energy consuming methods of fish production such as aquaculture. Therefore, a concerted effort on the development of the inland fisheries sector, which has a potential for development in terms of about 300,000 acres of water bodies should be made. In this regard, a loan of Rs. 540 million expected from the ADB for the development of this sector through investments in research, training, extension, processing and marketing over the next five years could be of vital importance.",

During the past decade, the activity of these sectors had declined although there is considerable scope for exploiting the potential in this sector for expanding production. In view of the heavy investments required and the advanced technology involved, the private sector initiatives are not forth\u00adcoming in this sector.

The maximum limit under the line of credit is determined by the bank in consultation with the borrower after taking into consideration the anticipated cropping pattern over the three year period. Hence, the loan under the NCRCS is not a crop specific loan. The farmer is given the flexibility to undertake the cultivation of any crop he prefers, taking into consideration the availability of water, prices and profitability. Also, it reduces for the borrower as well as for the lending bank the transaction cost as the filling of forms is undertaken once only for six seasons. With a view to further reducing costs of operating the scheme, banks were also required to adopt an area approach in lending. Instead of scattering the loans over a large area, banks now tend to concentrate their loans in selected areas, which helps better end-use supervision and recovery. To assist farmers who have had a sound financial relationship over a reasonable period of time, the banks are also required to dispense with some of the security arrangements such as the requirement to provide inter-se guarantee of two farmers.",

Yala 1986 was the first occasion that the TCCSs participated in a scheme of credit financed by the banking system with the refinance support of the Central Bank. Only two societies registered under the provisions of the NCRCS in time for the Yala 1986. It is expected that more societies will join the scheme in the future. TCCSs participation in the scheme was secured on the basis of a partner\u00adship arrangement. Under the partnership arrangement, the TCCSs put up 25 per\u00adcent of the resources required while 75 per cent of the resources is. provided by the lending bank. The risk of loss is shared between the TCCSs and the bank in the same proportion. Since there is participation by the TCCSs both in the provision of resources as well as in the sharing of risk, it is expected that there will be greater discipline at the stages of loaning, disbursements and recovery. Only a small number of Multi-Purpose Co-operative Societies (MPCSs) continue to channel cultivation loans to their members with the assistance of the PB. A large majority of MPCSs have been made ineligible by PB because of previous defaults. In order to bring back the ineligible MPCSs into the system once again, NCRCS provide for securing their participation on the basis of a partnership. The PB requires such MPCSs to participate in the risk sharing up to 40 per cent. In the Yala 1986, there were no MPCSs participating in the scheme on the basis of the new arrangements.",
