GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

Overall Trends

In 1986, Sri Lanka's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have increased by 4.3 per cent, in real terms. The reduction in the growth rate compared with the 5 per cent growth in 1985 was largely due to lower production in tea and paddy sub-sectors. However, coconut, minor export crops and minor food crops sub-sectors showed appreciable growth. In the manufacturing sector, factory indus­tries and small and other industries recorded considerable expansion.

The Gross National Product (GNP) at current factor cost prices increased by 10.3 per cent to reach Rs. 159.9 billion in 1986. In real terms, GNP increased by 4.5 per cent compared with 5.3 per cent growth in 1985. The implicit GNP deflator which measures the overall price change rose by 5.5 per cent in 1986 compared with the 1 per cent increase in 1985.

Sri Lanka's mid-year population in 1986 has been provisionally estimated at 16.1 million, which is a 1.8 per cent growth over 1985. Accordingly, per capita GNP at current prices is estimated at Rs. 9,918 (U.S. $ 354). In real terms, per capita income is estimated to have increased by 2.7 per cent compared with 3.7 per cent growth in the previous year. The real national income, which is estimated after adjusting for the terms of trade effect, increased by 3.4 per cent in 1986.

The main sources of economic growth in 1986 were manufacturing, agriculture, trade and public administration. Factory industries have been the leading growth sub-sector in 1986.

Sectoral Performance

The growth rates in various sectors for the period 1984-1986 are given in Table 1.2. The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector grew by 2.6 per cent in 1986 over the previous year. The increase in value added in the agricultural sector in 1986 was 2.2 per cent, while in forestry and fisheries sub-sectors the increases were 1.8 and 8.9 per cent, respectively. The relatively poor performances in the agricultural sector in 1986 compared with the 9.9 per cent growth in 1985 was partly compen­sated by the improved performance in the fisheries sub-sector.

In plantation agriculture, rubber production increased by 0.6 per cent while tea production declined by 1.3 per cent. The coconut sub-sector which recorded a 52 per cent growth in 1985 expanded marginally by 2.8 per cent in 1986. In the fisheries sub-sector, sea fish production increased by 8.3 per cent while fresh-water fish production rose by 9.8 per cent.

The manufacturing sector expanded by 8.4 per cent in 1986. The export oriented agro-processing industries virtually stagnated consequent to the reduced output growth in the plantation sector. In the factory industries sub-sector, state-owned industries expanded by 7.6 per cent while the output of private industries

increased by 15 per cent. Small and medium industries too recorded relatively high growth. Large increases in output values were recorded in jewellery manufacture and gem and diamond cutting.

In the mining and quarrying sector, a 5.2 per cent growth was recorded in 1986. This was largely the outcome of an expansion in gem exports which recorded an increase of 15 per cent in SDR terms.

The construction sector expanded by 1.5 per cent in 1986. The lower rate of growth was largely due to the reduced level of construction work under the Accele­rated Mahaweli Project as most of the head-works had been already completed. Private construction was undertaken on a large scale with the financial assistance of the banking sector. Value added in electricity, gas, water and sanitary services increased by 7.1 per cent in 1986. Electricity generation in 1986 expanded by 8.3 per cent while production of gas increased by 35 per cent.
