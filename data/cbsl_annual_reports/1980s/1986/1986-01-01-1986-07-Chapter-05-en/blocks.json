This resulted, in a decline of thermal power generation to a negligible level thereby reducing not only the cost of power but also the dependance on petroleum for electricity generation. Consequently, the relative share of electricity in the total supply of commercial energy increased from 38 per cent in 1985 to 40 per cent in 1986. On the other hand, the reduced demand for petroleum together with low oil prices in the international market resulted in the saving of a sizeable amount of foreign exchange, thereby easing pressure on the balance of payments.",

An important reason for the reduced demand was the decline in the consumption of heavy diesel and furnace oil by 15 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively in 1986 compared with the previous year. Demand for auto-diesel increased marginally and that for petrol increased by 7 per cent as a result of the expansion in the transport sector. The demand for kerosene increased marginally in 1986.",

However, the RTBs were able to operate only 376 million kilometers in 1986, as against a total of 390 million kilometers in the previous year. This was largely due to the civil disturbances in some parts of the country which affected the services adversely. Consequently, the RTBs were able to operate only 18 per cent of their scheduled kilometerage in the Northern region, 40 per cent in the Eastern region and 62 per cent in the North Central region. The situation was further compounded by the run-down state of the bus fleet. Nearly 36 per cent of the existing fleet is more than ten years old, of which 1,040 buses being over 14 years old have long outlived their economic lifespan.",

In addition, international communication services too were expanded with the commissioning of the South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe (SEA-ME-WE) submarine cable project. The implementation of the Master Plan prepared in 1981 for the upgrading of telecommunication services was almost completed during the year. In addition, the Department of Telecommunication has worked out a supplementary Master Plan with foreign technical and financial assistance to eliminate completely the over\u00adall imbalance in the system and to meet the nationwide demand for telecommu\u00adnication services.",

The extent under subsidiary food crops in the 'H' area increased by 46 per cent to 13,091 hectares. The greater area brought under the cultivation of chillies and onions, particularly in the areas like Kalawewa, accounted for this increase. The area under subsidiary food crops in System 'G' also expanded by about 20 per cent to 1,470 hectares.",

The total cost of the project was estimated at Rs. 340 million. Nelu Oya Diversion Scheme to augment Morawewa, was continued, albeit slowly, owing to security problems. The progress of the Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settle\u00adment Project was somewhat retarded during the year owing to delays in the construction of the main canals by the contractors. Stage I of the Nilwak Ganga Flood Protection Scheme, which could not be completed as scheduled in 1985 owing to adverse weather, was completed in 1986. Approximately 1,300 hectares of already cultivated land and 700 hectares of new land will receive flood protection relief from this stage of the project. The total cost of this project at this stage is estimated at Rs. 525 million. The Gal Oya Rehabilitation and Water Management Project, partly funded by USAID and aimed at rehabilitating the left bank of the Gal Oya Irrigation System covering 24,300 hectares was scheduled to be completed at the end of 1985. However, only about 85 per cent of the project was completed by the time USAID funding ended. The residual work, mainly the construction of field channels, was continued with government funds in 1986.",
