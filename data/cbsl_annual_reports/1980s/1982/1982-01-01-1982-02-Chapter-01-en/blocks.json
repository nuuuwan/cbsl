The real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), on the other hand, is estimated to have increased by 5.1 per cent as against the rate of growth of 5.8 per cent recorded in 1981.

The construction sector recorded a negative growth rate for the second succes\u00adsive year.

Production of tea during the year amounted to 187.8 million kilograms as compared with 210 million kilograms in 1981. The fall in pro\u00adduction appears to have stemmed primarily from the decline in average yield rather than the lower extent in bearing during the year. The decline in yield was closely linked to unfavourable weather conditions that prevailed during the first quarter of the year. Despite a drop in extent under tapping, rubber production improved marginally by 1 million kilograms to 125 million kilograms owing to the increase in average yield over the previous year. The average yield of 726 kilograms per hectare in 1982 was, however, well below the peak yield of 845 kilograms achieved in 1978. The coconut sector, however, continued its impressive record of growth with an 11 per cent increase in production of nuts. Production in 1982 was 2,510 million nuts. The data on export earnings of minor export crops indicate that production in this sector has dropped with the exception of coffee which recorded a 43 per cent increase in export volume.",

This increase in output is in fact the highest increase recorded since 1978 and was the combined outcome of the expanded output of the public sector industry helped largely by the uninterrupted power supply during 1982, and the improved output of the export oriented private sector industry. Output of the private sector industries increased by 18 per cent while that of the public sector indus\u00adtries increased by 5 per cent. In view of the fact that more than 60 per cent of indus\u00adtrial output is contributed by the public sector, its growth rate though lower than that of the private sector was a major influence on the high overall growth in output of the industrial sector.",

Adverse weather conditions have in large measure contributed to the decline in tea and paddy production, which given its heavy weightage in total domestic production, has depressed the overall growth rate, partly through the adverse impact on the agro-processing industrial sector as well. However, there are clear signs that the economy has to perform better in the basic sectors such as agriculture and industry, if other ancillary activities which contribute in no small measure to national income are to have sustained growth pros\u00adpects. Particular mention must be made of the need to increase the proportion of the GDP which is exported and its crucial importance in maintaining the country's balance of payments viability. The ratio of exports to GDP has been on a declining trend during the past few years and was 23 per cent in 1982.",

The growth rates of major industrial Countries were even lower than their rates of growth in 1981. GNP at constant prices of 7 leading industrial countries, i.e., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, U.K. and U.S.A. recorded only a mere 0.1 per cent increase in 1982. The individualist policies adopted by these countries paid no heed to the fact that the crisis was a global one.. Due to tight monetary and demand management policies, they were able to bring down the inflation rates to single digit levels on an average but unemployment rates were pushed up to double digit levels in a number of coun\u00adtries such as U.S.A., U.K. and Canada. Consequently, protectionist measures were strengthened thus causing further problems to developing countries like Sri Lanka. This together with the weak demand for primary goods following a slow down in manufacturing helped ta intensify competition among primary producers and depressed primary commodity prices.",

A striking example of this is that while coconut production increased by an impressive 11 per cent, the consequential gain was almost, fully wiped out by the drop in international prices. Export duty revenues were in fact 21 per cent lower than in 1981. The case of rubber provides an even more striking example. While the volume of exports increased by 17 per cent or by 19 million kilograms, export earnings declined by 20 per cent.

    "text": "One of the notable features of the economic performance in 1982 has been the significant abatement in the rate of inflation. After three successive years of high increases in the price level, the rate of increase in the general level of prices dipped to single digit figure. The average annual rate of increase in the Colombo Consumers Price Index (CCPI) was 10.8 per cent while the increase registered by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) turned out to be even smaller at 5.5. per cent. The comparable increase in the previous year were 18 per cent and 17 per cent in CCPI and rWPI respectively. This was brought about by many factors. The Government pursued a conscious and consistent policy aimed at controlling inflation by reducing the impact of budget deficits. The Central Bank continued its tight monetary policies thus leading to the success in demand management policies. Stability in prices of some of the imported goods due to lower inflation rates in the world contributed a fair share in support, of the stabilisation policies pursued by Sri Lanka. The administered price adjustments associated with the withdrawal of consumer subsidies in the first few years of liberalization had been more or less completed and this was assisted by the stable exchange rate that existed throughout the year. In fact, the prices of wheat flour and sugar were reduced during the course of the year. Despite production shortfalls in the first half of the year, the availability of imports of rice at relatively stable prices helped prevent rice prices from rising significantly. Continuous surveillance of the impact of monetary and fiscal policies on the price level, however, cannot be relaxed on account of this moderation. Efforts to increase production, particularly food, will be called for if the hard won gains on the prices front are to be preserved in the future as well.",

Firstly, the Sri Lankan economy by its very nature and state of development has a large unorganized sector. Secondly, quite apart from employment in the primary sector, the new economic opportunities gene\u00adrated by rising incomes which are the outcome of the increased rates of economic growth in the recent past, have resulted in diverse types of employment opportunities. Examples of such opportunities are the private transport sector and trade sector, especially retailing, where the full extent of such employment does not get reflected in the official statistics.

Consequently, foreign savings have had a large role to play in sustaining the high level of investment in 1982 as well. Domestic savings are estimated at Rs. 12.1 billion or 12.1 per cent of GDP in 1982 as against Rs. 9.9 billion in 1981. Investment, on the other hand, is estimated at Rs. 30.5 billion or 30 per cent of GDP. While there has been a marginal increase in the domestic savings ratio, it is still disappointingly low in relation to the investment level which continues to be around 30 per cent of GDP at current market prices. National savings have, however, been sustained by the rapid growth in net private transfers from abroad resulting from the larger flow of foreign remit\u00adtances of Sri Lankans employed abroad.

Policies to stimulate the growth of financial savings have been, by and large, successful with the rate of increase in time and savings deposits positively responding to high nominal rates of interest. However, it would appear that, on the whole, policies to encourage total savings through mobilization of financial savings, successful in a narrow sense, have been off-set by declines in savings elsewhere.",

Coming as it does in the wake of a programmed withdrawal of subsidies, it does seem that efforts have not yielded results. It is true that the international economic environment has taken a heavy toll on government revenue, which is heavily depen\u00addent on export tax revenues. The need to reduce duties and maintain producer incentives, has had a large impact on the Government's capacity to generate savings. However, Sri Lanka has witnessed very large increases in investment since 1978 and the direct beneficiaries of such investment, associated largely with investment in infrastructure projects, will have to contribute their share to govern\u00adment revenue, This is essential if the public sector were to contribute its due share to the national savings effort. In this context, it is to be noted that revenue as a percentage of GDP at market prices has shown a declining trend even if one were to exclude export duty revenues.",

During the year, the total amount of credit extended to the rural sector declined marginally by 2 per cent. Yet, this credit dis\u00adbursed under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (CRCS) by People's Bank, the rural banks, the Bank of Ceylon sub-offices and by the Hatton National Bank, as well as other loans to the rural sector extended by these institutions have hot shown a growth commensurate with the increased level of activities which the rural sector has experienced in recent years. This trend is suggestive of an increased dependence on other more expensive sources of credit.",

In 1982, only a little over half the amount disbursed during the 1981/82 cultivation year was renewed. Although the drought had a serious impact on the repayment capacity of many farmers, and high\u00adlights the need for an efficient crop insurance scheme, the rehabilitation of the defaul\u00adters who, through their ineligibility to borrow had contributed to the decline in credit to the rural sector, engaged the attention of both the Central Bank and the Rural Credit Advisory Board (RCAB) . The re-scheduling scheme for cultivation loans granted under the CRCS from January 1977 to June 30, 1981 was initiated by the RCAB in the previous year and was implemented by the Bank of Ceylon which commenced the consolidation and re-scheduling of loans under this scheme in 1982. The People's Bank, however, has yet to implement this scheme. Unless the two state banks involved in rural lending make a concerted effort to implement this scheme, a segment of credit-needy farmers who are non-wilful defaulters will not have access to credit in the future.",

During the year ended 1982, there were 19 new share issues totalling Rs. 371 million as against 13 such issues amounting to Rs. 285 million during the previous year. The highest number of new issues in 1982 was in respect of Hotels & Travels, followed by investments in the Engineering, Motors & Industries categories. There was some evidence that the fiscal incentives provided for broad based ownership of companies and for increased investor partici\u00adpation were beginning to show results. As in 1981, the peak activity in the primary issue market was during the first quarter of the year which coincides with the last quarter of the income tax year. Almost all the shares were issued during this period. Except for three share offerings in December 1982, the lists of the other 16 companies were closed by the end of the year. Most of these issues were fully subscribed or underwritten before the closing of the respective lists. The increasing volume of new share issues as well as the broad basing of existing companies are indicative of the badly needed revitalization of the capital market which had been stagnant for a number of years.",

The expansionary impact of the budget was, however, less in 1982 largely due to a build-up of cash balances which occurred during the year. The overall budget deficit, however, increased from 17.5 per cent of GDP in 1981 to 20.2 per cent in 1982. This was due to the increase in expenditure during the year of 23 per cent being very much higher than the increase in total revenue of 10 per cent. Revenue as a percentage of GDP declined from 19 per cent in 1981 to 18 per cent in 1982, the lowest ratio during the last decade. Expenditure particularly capital expenditure during the year, however, ran at well below budgetted levels presumably due to the uncertainties that had prevailed on account of both the Presidential Election and the Referendum held during the year.",

While the deterioration in the current account was also due to the sluggish world demand for Sri Lanka's traditional export products as manifested in the declining terms of trade, it was due in equal measure to higher import procurement. While a good part of the higher imports was aid financed, imports nevertheless grew by 14 per cent as compared with a one per cent increase in 1981. On the other hand, export performance in 1982 with a rate of growth of only 3.4 per cent in SDR terms has been disappointing. While it is true that the reduced world demand depressed the prices of our exports and the export volumes suffered due to adverse production trends, the deceleration in the rate of growth of exports in the face of the ever increasing demand for imports, calls for urgent action to increase production for exports with an equal emphasis in the still unexploited areas of import substitution.",

Private transfers in 1982 amounted to Rs. 5,789 million (SDR 252 million) or Rs. 1,359 million (SDR 57 million) more than what was received in 1981. Net inflows of capital were Rs. 9,885 million (SDR 431 million) in 1982 as compared with Rs. 7,691 million (SDR 341 million) in 1981. Nevertheless, the year, witnessed a further decline in the country's net external assets although there was an increase in gross external assets by 20 per cent to Rs. 10,956 million (SDR 466 million). The increase in gross external assets was brought about by the increased accumulation of liabilities by both the Central Bank and the commercial banks. Gross external assets at the end of 1982 were adequate to finance about 3 months imports.",

In this context, while demand management policies can help in providing the necessary favourable climate for savings, investment and exports and in enhancing the effectiveness of the adjustment process, Sri Lanka's balance of payments problem is.more fundamental in character to be overcome merely by the pursuit of demand management policies alone. The situation warrants corrective action in the form of strenuous efforts at promoting exports and the pursuit of policies which are conducive to export growth. These matters should receive the most urgent attention of the Government.",

The increased demand for the principal sources of energy stemming from the expanded economic and social activities as well as the increase in oil prices during 1981 have resulted in a rapidly rising import bill for crude oil and petroleum products. The value of petroleum imports in SDR terms increased by 20 per cent in 1982. Oil imports constituted 67 per cent of Sri Lanka's total earnings from non-petroleum exports for 1982 as against 56 per cent in the pre\u00advious year. While the increase in demand for electricity had to be met through additional thermal generation and hence, higher petroleum imports, the value of petroleum exports which had during the past few years been increasing, also declined by 4 per cent due to increased consumption of exportable oil products, viz., heavy diesel and naptha. As a proportion of total export earnings, the net oil import bill increased from 32 per cent in 1981 to 41 per cent in the current year. The growing demand coupled with higher prices exerted severe pressure on the balance of payments as well.",

While increased production of rice and of other subsidiary food crops has contributed to the decline in the share of consumer goods imports, this process should be accelerated. There still exists a great deal of unrealised potential in the agro-based industrial sector both for purposes of import substitution as well as for exports. With the opening up of the lands under the Mahaveli Scheme, there will be ample scope for the growing of crops other than paddy. It is also necessary that the increased production of paddy that could be expected from these developments does not suffer by way of depressed prices due to pronounced increases in supplies. Consideration will have to be given to the export potential in rice, if the encouraging momentum in rice production is to be sustained in the future. The major emphasis, however, has to be on conservation of fuel, if there is to be a sizeable impact on the large and growing import bill. It is also important that the large investments made in the shipping and airline sectors, essentially through foreign commercial financing, be made to pay their way, if they are not to increase the debt service burden as well as cause problems for the government budget.",

The prospects of an increasing debt service burden, peaking of the inflow of private remittances and the bleak outlook for concessional aid add a sense of urgency to this task. However, the task of accelerating exports is not going to be easy in the present international environment. Sluggish growth coupled with rising rates of unemployment in the industrial countries has meant restrained demand for imports in these countries. In addition, recessionary conditions in the industrial countries have also led to the strengthening of protectionist tendencies. Apart from their impact on exports, the present fiscal and monetary policies in such countries resulting in high nominal and real rates of interest will add to Sri Lanka's debt service burden, even in respect of borrowings made from inter\u00adnational lending institutions. Notwithstanding the adverse climate, efforts directed towards increasing the export volumes of the plantation crops, tea, rubber and coconut, perhaps provide the best immedip.te prospects for augmenting the country's export earnings in the short-term. While the declared policy of the Government to confine tax holidays in the future essentially to export oriented ventures, is a desirable step, the rationalization of Sri Lanka's tariff structure could also provide the necessary climate for new export and import substituting ventures to be set up.",

The past five years have seen considerable progress. The most notable success has been in respect to the country's ability in breaking out of the low invest\u00adment and low growth pattern of the pre-1977 period. As observed in last year's annual report, it is unfortunate that Sri Lanka's export oriented growth strategy has had to be tried and tested in an entirely hostile international economic environment. Yet, the fact that economic growth continued to be sustained in the face of adverse developments is remarkable. The doubling of petroleum prices which led to subs\u00adtantial increases in the import bill, the recession which reduced the demand- for exports, government revenue and, to some extent, aid flows, and international infla\u00adtion which led to the continuous deterioration in the terms of trade and to cost escalations of the public investment program of the country are just three of such developments which had an overwhelming impact on the country's saving and investment record and on its balance of payments and budgetary performance. Nevertheless, Sri Lanka's growth rate of real GDP has averaged 6.2 per cent over the last five years. Both the public sector, through the public, investment program, as well as the private sector, which was freed of most controls, have contributed to the growth effort which has also been, accompanied by significant gains in employment.",

In addition, the high levels of investment in the face of-an inadequate increase in domestic savings, though sustained by concessional aid flows, have also meant increased resort to foreign commercial borrowing, a draw down of reserves and a depreciation in the exchange rate. The impact domestically of increased levels of investment has been the increase in the rate of price increases; escalating costs of investments and, in the face of continued inflationary trends, the lack of any significant increases in savings, implying a shift of resources from invest\u00adment to consumption. The pursuit of effective demand management policies, how\u00adever, has helped to restore the equilibrium somewhat in recent years. The adjust\u00adment process aimed at ensuring sustainable deficits in the current account of the balance of payments and in the budget necessarily called for policies which conti\u00adnued to demand heavy sacrifices from the people. There are clear signs that this adjustment momentum has to be maintained in the future as well, if the country is to benefit from its present economic strategy. The acceleration. of the rate-of growth in exports which was one of the major objectives of the economic and-exchange rate reforms has not materialized. While this is difficult to achieve in the present international economic environment, it must nevertheless continue to be an important objective particularly in the light of the growth rate in imports as well as the declining trend in the country's terms of trade. .",
