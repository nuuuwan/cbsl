The rate of growth of exports in SDR terms was only 0.6 per cent in 1982 as compared to a 13 per cent growth in 1981. On the other hand, imports grew at a faster rate of 13 per cent in 1982 as against a 2 per cent growth registered in 1981. The higher rate of growth of imports in 1982 was very largely due to the purchase of ships (SDR 44 million) and aircraft (SDR 107 million) during the year, which resulted in a bulging of investment goods imports for the year. The higher growth of imports in 1982 has therefore to be viewed in this context.",

The adjustments made to. the Customs data on imports were largely onaccaunt of ships and aircraft that were imported during the year. As a result, the trade deficit for 1982 turned out to be substantially higher than the adjusted trade deficit for the year 1981 which was Rs. 15,539 million (SDR 685 million).

For the first time in recent history this sector accounted for less than one half of total earnings. Thus, while the share of industrial exports increased, the increase was more on account of a drop in earnings from the traditional exports rather than to a faster rate of growth of the industrial exports. In this sense, diversification as indicated by the increasing share of industrial exports in total exports is somewhat less encouraging. A welcome feature however is that the export earnings from minor agricultural products continued to increase and their total exceeded the level of earnings from coconut products in 1982. Tea continued to be the principal item of export, accounting for 30 per cent of total exports.",

There was, however, a 4 per cent decline in the earnings from petroleum products, largely a result of the local utilization by the State Fer\u00adtilizer Manufacturing Corporation of the usual exportable surplus of naphtha. An encouraging sign on the industrial export front is the increase in the share of \"other industrial exports\" which has recorded an impressive performance in 1982. This category consisting essentially of non-traditional exports such as, animal feed, chemical products, footwear, articles of leather, rubber and wood, wall tiles and mechanical appliances,- has increased its share in total export earnings from 4 per cent to 7 per cent or from SDR 40 million to SDR 65 million.",

The average gross price at the Colombo Auctions, however, increased significantly by 30 per cent from Rs. 18.10 per kg. in 1981 to Rs. 23.44 per kg. in 1982. The rise in the Colombo Auction price for the year is largely explained by the reduced export duty on tea applicable during 1982 as compared to the previous year. The price of Sri Lanka tea sold at the London Auctions at 107 pence per kg. also showed an increase of 14 per cent over the price realized in 1981, but was volume-wise too small to make a significant impact on the average f.o.b. price for the year. Export duties on all varieties of tea, in bulk (Rs. 8.00 per kg.), packeted (Rs. 6.50 per kg.), tea bags (Re. 1.00 per kg.), instant tea (Rs. 13.50 per kg.) and green tea (Rs. 8.00 per kg.) remained unchanged during 1982.",

    "text": "The rubber trade was faced with serious problems during the year owing to the low prices that prevailed in the international markets, the result of a general slack in demand following the recession in industrialised countries. In addition, world rubber stocks remained at a very high level, around 40 per cent of the world's annual production. The International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO) which came into existence in 1981, intervened in the markets by purchasing upto 260,000 tons of natural rubber during 1982. The buffer stock operations of the INRO helped to some extent in arresting the price declines, but prices failed to improve due to the prevailing gloomy conditions of the world economy. Moreover, the Sri Lanka-China Trade Protocol for 1982 did not provide for any barter transactions and hence the absence of any provisions for the purchase of a specified quantity of rubber by the People's Republic of China. As a result, rubber exports to the People's Republic of China which were 35.2 million kgs. valued at Rs. 809 million in 1981 declined to 8.2 million kgs. valued at Rs. 139 million in 1982. There was no change in the export duty on rubber during the year.",

    "text": "The value of exports of coconut products in 1982 increased marginally to Rs. 1,496 million (SDR 65 million). The increase was wholly due to a rise in the value of coconut by-products, while the value of exports of coconut kernel products declined. The fall in the value of coconut kernel products occurred inspite of the fact that there had been an impressive 42 per cent increase in the export volume, helped by a significant increase in production. In terms of nut equivalent, the volume of exports of desiccated coconut, coconut oil and copra increased substantially from 401 million nuts in 1981 to 569 million nuts in 1982. However, the prices for coconut products in the international markets were not favourable during the year due mainly to the increased availability of cheap edible oils. Earnings from the export of coconut oil and copra recorded increases, while those from desiccated coconut declined. The average export prices of coconut kernel products declined markedly from Rs. 2.52 per nut in 1981 to Rs. 1.76 per nut in 1982. Thus, the significant increase in export volume has helped in a big way to sustain the earnings from the export of coconut products in 1982. The export of coconut products continued to remain liberalised during the year. However, as mentioned elsewhere in this report, towards the latter part of the year, price support schemes had to be introduced for coconut oil and desiccated coconut in order to prevent the collapse of the export market.",

The lower volume of export was the result of a large volume of naphtha being utilized locally by the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation in the produc\u00adtion of urea. The net foreign exchange earnings from the export of textile and garments and petroleum products were much lower than the net earnings from other exports (i.e agricultural and mineral exports) since the import content of textile and garments and petroleum exports was fairly high. Apart from these two items, the value of other industrial exports increased very significantly by 63 per cent from Rs.900 million (SDR 40 million) in 1981 to Rs. 1,489 million (SDR 65 million) in 1982, expanding its share of the total export earnings from 4 per cent in 1981 to nearly 7 per \u2022cent in 1982. >",

In the context of the existence of a large number of incentives, the stagnant position of the export sector was a matter for concern. The export volumes of the two major export commodities declined, while their export prices too were unfavourable. Though significant improvements were evident in the volume of exports of coconut kernel products, the price trends were such that the country was unable to obtain the maximum benefit. The increase in the value of gem exports resulted from the re-export of diamonds. The situation is best illustrated by the fact that had it not been for such re:exports;of diamonds and garments, the earnings of which are recorded on a gross basis (inclusive of their high import con\u00adtent) the export sector would have recorded a negative growth in 1982. These trends appear to underline the urgency of some corrective measures to be taken to improve export performance. The improvements shown in the sectors of minor agricultural exports and other industrial exports, which could be considered as possible target areas for more concentrated attention, were encouraging.",

In addition, processing of raw materials with a view to increasing domestic value added in exports, received the attention of the authorities during the year. However, the developments observed in the export and import sectors in 1982 were not very encouraging, in contrast to the experience of the preceding year. The rate of export growth declined considerably, though a higher level of export performance was a prime necessity in sustaining the outward looking growth strategy. At the same time, a faster rate of growth of imports was experienced in 1982, in contrast to the marginal rate of growth recorded in 1981. As in other years, foreign resources were used in filling the gap between imports and exports. The continuing and widening trade gap is a matter for considerable concern.",

A new 5 year agreement between Sri Lanka and China was signed in 1982. It is of a general nature, granting most favoured nation treatment and providing payments\u00abfor transactions in convertible currencies. However, Sri Lanka's exports to China declined from Rs. 860 million in 1981 to Rs. 175 million in 1982, while imports from China increased from Rs. 686 million to Rs. 872 million.

Free competition in the market was expected to safeguard the interests of both the consumer as well as the producer. Therefore, an environment for greater competition in trade between the state sector and the private sector had to be created not only by allowing the private sector to enter the trade in many fields which happened to be the monopolies of state organisations but also by removing rigid controls to permit the free interplay of market forces. Hence, market interference by the authorities was restricted to the barest minimum and was exercised in an acceptable manner without distorting the price mechanism and through free market instruments such, as buffer stock operations. It was generally confined to improving consumer awareness and resis-tence, and the use of moral suasion as in the previous year.",

During the year, 118 new Consumer Societies were established to promote consumer awareness and restrict malpractices in trade. The total number of societies at the end of the year were 1,368 . Further, 'District Consumer Society Federations'were established in each of the 24 districts. - The Consumer Protection Fund established in 1980 to finance consumer education programmes was credited with Rs. 300,350 during the year, while payments from the Fund amounted to Rs. 269,580. In addition, consumer education stalls at the Mahapola Trade Fairs were organised, as in previous years, to promote consumer education and link trade between rural and urban areas.

Greater emphasis was placed on export oriented activities, and the purchase of locally manufactured products, aimed at helping the local producer and promoting national development. However, in-spite of these efforts most of the corporations continued to record a reduced turnover this year too, due mainly to severe competition from the private sector. According to the provisional estimates, the total turnover of the 11 trading corporations in 1982 amounted to Rs. 4,315 million indicating a drop of 7 per cent below the turnover of Rs. 4,640 million recorded in 1981,",

Due to the increased availability of goods at competitive prices (in the open market), the dependence of the consumers on co-operatives for their day to day needs was no longer a necessity. This could be seen from the marked decrease-in the turnover of the co-operatives from Rs. 9,870 million in 1981 to Rs. 8,320 million in 1982, a fall of 16 per eeht. Yet, a majority of the low income earners preferred to use co-operatives as the major source of supply for their needs, since the co-operatives handled the bulk of the items distributed under the Food Stamp Scheme. In 1982 the co-operative societies continued to handle the Food Stamp Scheme. According to estimates based on a Central Bank Survey, despite a reduction in the turnover, the co-operative sector was able to achieve an increased margin of 6 per cent in 1982 as against 4 per cent in 1981 over the costs of its purchases.",
