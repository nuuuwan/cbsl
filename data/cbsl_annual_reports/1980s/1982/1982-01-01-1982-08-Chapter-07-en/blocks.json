Despite a production short-fall in paddy in the first half of this year, the availability of imports of rice at relatively stable prices helped prevent rice prices from rising significantly. The price of sugar too, declined consequent on declining international prices and the Food Commissioner's release of excess stocks at lower prices. The import price of wheat grain remained relatively stable, thus enabling wheat flour to be marketed without an increase in price for the first ten months of the year. The wheat flour price was in fact reduced in October 1982 from Rs. 6.65 per kg. to Rs. 5.95 per kg. The stability in oil prices also had a role to play. The price of kerosene, which has a direct impact on the cost of living and diesel and petrol prices, which have an impact on the transport costs of domestic commodities, remained unchanged in 1982.",

However, the price increases in 1982 were proportionately less than in 1981 for most items. The average retail price of rice increased by only 5 per cent from Rs. 6.25 in 1981 to Rs. 6.56 in 1982 as compared with an increase of 33 per cent in 1981. Price increases were higher in 1982 only for sea fish, dried chillies and spices. The notable exception was a 10 per cent decrease in the average retail price of coconut. This decrease is partly due to lower international prices for coconut products.",
