    "text": "During the year, the Government contracted 20 project loans, 6 commodity ioans and 3 cash and other loans. The value of these loans as at 31st December, 1982 amounted to Rs. 12,144 million. In comparison the value of loans contracted in the previous year amounted to Rs. 14,464 million. There has been no improvement during the year in the utilization rate of loans contracted. As at end of 1982, the aggregate utilization rate of the loans contracted since 1970 remained at 50 per cent, as was in 1981. While the level of utilization of project loans was 29 per cent, commodity loans and cash and other loans recorded a very much higher rate of 81 per cent and 84 per cent respectively. It was significant that the more expensive cash loans which were fully utilized in the previous years were not fully utilized in the year under review. Of the Eurocurrency commercial loan of US $ 100 million contracted in 1982, only $ 40 million was utilized during the year. Among other loans, contracted in 1981 there were 5 loans amounting to Rs. 1,544 million on which withdrawals did not commence until the end of 1982.",

    "text": "The monetary scenario in 1982 depicted developments in major monetary variables similar to those in the previous year. The broad money supply (M2) com\u00adprising currency in circulation and the total of demand, time and savings deposits held by the public with commercial banks, grew by Rs. 6,063 million or 25 per cent compared to an increase of Rs. 4,587 million or 23 per cent in 1981. However, a deceleration was evident in the rate of growth in time and savings deposits held by the public with commercial banks (quasi-money). The rate of growth of these de\u00adposits which dropped from 41 per cent in 1980 to 38 per cent in 1981 declined further to 30 per cent in 1982. This was particularly associated with the downward revision in deposit rates by commercial banks in mid 1982, with the interest rates being offered by the National Savings Bank remaining unchanged. Hence, the slight acceleration in M z was largely reflected in the accelerated growth in narrow money supply (Mj) defined as currency and demand deposits held by the public.",

This marginal decline in the income velocity of M 2 indicated that the rates of growth in monetary aggregates had moved almost in line with the growth in output of goods and services exer\u00adting a reduced pressure on the price level when compared with the previous years. Partly reflecting this development, the Colombo Consumers' Price Index on a point to point basis recorded an increase of only 5 per cent during the 12 months ending December 1982, as against 18 per cent in the previous year.",

The relatively low rate, of growth registered in the current year was due to the downward revision of time deposit rates by commercial banks in mid 1982. Total quasi-money supply at end 1982 amounted to Rs. 18,750 million. However, a major part of this expansion (80 per cent) was recorded during the first half of the year. Reflecting this, the annual rate of growth of time and savings deposits which Stood at 38 per cent in December, 1981, accelerated to 47 per cent in May, 1982 and gradually decelerated to 30 per cent by the end of the year. This deceleration was mainly due to the shift in deposits from commercial banks to the National Savings Bank (NSB) following the lower interest rates offered by the former on deposits as front June, 1982. Notwithstanding this, the share of time and savings deposits in M 2 increased from 59 to 61 per cent reflecting public's preference for interest bearing monetary assets. This development, perhaps, was associated with the positive real rate of return on deposits offered by commercial banks with the reduced inflationary pressures in the economy.",

However, thq rate of expansion in time and savings deposits of other private sector constituents (private; sector proper) decelerated from 40 to 25 per cent within the current year as a result of the exodus of deposits from commercial banks to the NSB ands finance companies since mid 1982, consequent to the lowering of interest rates by banks.",

However, the rate of growth in percentage terms decelerated significantly from 33 per'cent in 1981, to 25 per cent in the year under review. Similar to the preceding .year, the-expansionary impact of this factor was partly offset by the drop in external banking assets (net) by Rs. 568 million or 19 per cent, and the increase in other items (net) of the banking system by Rs. 1,852 million.

Since the first Rupee Loan Programme amounting to Rs. 4,000 million was fully subscribed by September, 1982, an additional loan of Rs. 2,000 million was floated during the same month. This too was fully subscribed by the end of the year due to the enhanced subscrip\u00adtions mainly from the NSB. This was made possible by the increased deposit mobilisation of the NSB following the downward revision of deposit rates of commercial banks in June, 1982. Moreover, the government's reliance on the banking system was also lower due to the drawing of US $ 40 million (Rs. 836 million) from the Euro Currency Loan Arrangement for US $ 100 million. Furthermore, the high rate of under expenditure relating to capital and recurrent expenditure of the Government experienced during 1982, also resulted in lower cash requirements during the year.",

On the other hand, borrowings by the government from commercial banks increased by only Rs. 156 million or 10 per cent when compared to a considerable increase of Rs. 624 million or 66 per cent in 1981. While investments of commercial banks in Treasury Bills remained almost at the same level as in December, 1981, their contribution to the Government Rupee Loan Programme increased by Rs. 103 million following the relaxation of regulations permitting commercial banks to participate in this pro\u00adgramme since August, 1982.",

Of this growth, (Rs. 4,122 million) a major share (97 per cent) was on account of an increase in credit granted to other private sector constituents. Gross credit to this sector increased by Rs. 3,986 million or 26 per cent during the year. Nevertheless, credit to this sector indicated a decelerating trend during the past two years. Several reasons could be attributed to the deceleration in credit to the private sector. First, the deceleration in credit to this sector, particularly during the last quarter of 1982, was due to the uncertainty that prevailed in the business circles arising from the Presidential election and the Referendum. Secondly, the intensification of restricitive monetary policy measures during 1981 resulted in a deceleration in demand for credit from the private sector. Thirdly, the lump sum depreciation facility, which was one of the factors that contributed to the higher demand for credit, had been withdrawn at end March, 1981.",

Continuing the trends observed in the second half of the preceding year, a substantial growth in deposits coupled with a significant deceleration in demand for credit from the private sector enhanced the liquidity base of the commercial banks. This continuous improvement in liquidity, without a corresponding increase in avai-lability of attractive short-term investment outlets, led the commercial banks to effect certain changes in their deposit mobilisation programmes in mid year. First, the interest rates on all classes of time deposits were reduced by the two state banks and this was followed by most other banks. Secondly, many commercial banks discon\u00adtinued the practice of accepting 24 month deposits. Thirdly, some banks discouraged even the inflow of 12 month deposits by offering higher rates on relatively short-term deposits (6 months and below). The objective of these measures was to reduce the cost of deposit mobilisation, while adjusting the term structure of deposits in favour of shorter term deposits. Meanwhile, the two state banks suspended their special long term saving schemes. These were the Minor's Deposit Scheme of the People's Bank and the National Endowment Scheme of the Bank of Ceylon.",

Moreover, special arrangements were made by some banks for the encashment of remittances received from Sri Lankans employed abroad, in an attempt to attract deposits from the beneficiaries of such remittances. Some foreign banks, through their branches in the Middle East, were able to canvass for remittances from Sri Lankans working in that region. Commer\u00adcial banks also continued to issue Certificates of Deposits (CDs) thereby attracting a good amount of hoarded money into the system. At end 1982,18 banks had been given formal approval to issue CDs. The outstanding amount of CDs stood at Rs. 323 million as at the same date.",

The plan estimated the outstanding credit to the private sector to be at Rs. 27,620 million by the end of 1982, a projected increase of Rs. 6,620 million or 32 per cent over the outstanding credit level of end 1981. In addition to ensuring the availability and efficient allo\u00adcation of credit among various sectors, credit planning attempts to match the financial flows with the desired goals in the real sector of the economy. In order to maintain consistency between financial and real output flows, the desired monetary target for the economy was set, taking into account the projected real growth, the estimated rate of inflation and an allowance for the increased monetisation in the economy. After allowing for the behaviour of the external sector, and the credit requirements of the Government, the monetary target was translated into a permissible credit target for the private sector. The estimated total credit was allocated among commercial banks after several rounds of discussions, where the relevant issues in sectoral distribution of credit were also dealt with in detail.",

However, during the last two quarters, the actual credit levels fell below the targetted levels registering a shortfall of about Rs. 1,000 million by the end of 1982. This was the combined outcome of a decline in demand for credit caused by high lending rates, the moderation in the rate of inflation and the uncertainty experienced in economic activities during the latter part of the year. In view of the moderation in the rate of inflation, though the realised credit level was below the targetted level in nominal terms, the level of credit recorded the same growth in real terms.",

With a view to giving special consideration to this sector, the quantum of refinance provided from the Medium and Long term Credit Fund (MLCF) of the Central Bank under category II was raised from 80 to 100 per cent to cover the entire cost of the project with effect from 22 January, 1982. With this revision, the refinance rate and the on-lending margins were also revised depending on the amount of the loan. Accor\u00addingly, the projects in which the total.cost does not exceed Rs. 5 million, the rate of interest was fixed at 10 per cent per annum subject to an on-lending margin of 2 per centage points whereas the refinance rate was fixed at Hi per cent per annum subject to an on-lending margin of 1\u00a3 percentage points for projects whose cost exceed Rs. 5 million. With effect from 20 July, 1982, the refinance rate applicable to the latter category was revised marginally from 11$ per cent per annum to 11 per cent per annum subject to an on-lending margin of 2 percentage points. With a view to providing further facilities for project lending, the Central Bank enhanced the Medium and Long term Credit Fund from Rs. 525 million to Rs. 775 million in June, 1982.",
