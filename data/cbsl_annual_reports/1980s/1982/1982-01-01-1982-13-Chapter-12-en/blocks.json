The corresponding increase in SDR terms was 22.9 per cent, as compared with 14.4 per cent increase in 1981. Amortization and interest payments to the IMF decreased by 4.1 per cent in 1982 as compared with 1981, while debt service payments in respect of other loans increased by 53.9 per cent over the same period. The net outcome of these developments was that the overall debt service ratio increased from 13.3 per cent in 1981 to 15.2 per cent in 1982. The debt service ratio exclusive of IMF transactions increased from 6.8 per cent to 9.5 per cent over the same period.",

As a percentage of GDP at current prices it increased from 36.6 percent to 38.0 per cent in 1982. Recurrent expenditure increased by 8.5 per cent over the previous year and amounted to Rs. 19,230 million during the year under review. Total revenue at Rs. 17,809 million showed an increase of 10 per cent. Consequently, the current account of the budget was in deficit by Rs. 1,421 million. This was despite a favourable development in the Advance Account operations where a net in-payment of Rs. 883 million was recorded after 13 successive years of out-payment. The deficit in current account was in contrast to the last few years experience when the current account exclusive of the adverse advance account operations was in surplus. Capital expenditure during the year amounted to Rs. 18,867 million and showed an increase of 41 per cent over 1981. The overall budget deficit registered in 1982 amounted to Rs. 20,289 million and was equivalent to about 20 per cent of the GDP in comparison to 17 per cent in 1981.",

In sharp contrast to the experience in the last decade when revenue collections always exceeded original targets, realized collections of revenue for the year in relation to the original estimates showed a shortfall of about 8 per cent, The apparently poor fiscal marksmanship in 1982 was partly a result of an over-estimation of international trade oriented taxes which was subject to vicissi\u00adtudes of trade specially during a year when the world economy was in deep recession.",

In contrast to a marginal increase of 3 per cent in 1981, export duty on rubber decreased by 47 per cent due to lower f.o.b. prices fetched during the year. In coconut too lower f.o.b. prices led to a 21 per cent decrease in spite of an increase in the volume of exports.

Thus, the share of these items in total recurrent expenditure increased from 55 per cent in 1981 to 57 per cent. Interest payments increased by 33 per cent to RsT5\",116 million largely on account of substantial increases in interest on domestic debt. Total interest commitments on domestic debt at Rs. 4,201 million indicated an increase of 34 per cent. While interest on rupee loans increased by 28 per cent to Rs. 2,167 million that on Treasury bills increased by 53 per cent to Rs. 2,001 million reflecting the increased quantum of the outstanding debt. Personal emoluments during the year increased by 18 per cent to Rs. 4,802 million on account of the adjustments of salaries with effect from 1st January, 1982 and the payment of a variable cost of living allowance. Expenditure on pensions increased sharply by 81 per cent to Rs. 1,637 million due to the payment of cost of living allowance and the consolidation of pensions.",

These operations, which hitherto were a major element of budgetary instability emerged in 1982 as a contributor to budgetary resources rather than as a net user of funds. This change was brought about by a substantial decrease in the net advances to government departments on account of in-payments arising from the draw-down of Food Commis\u00adsioner's stock by about Rs. 1,000 million. Accordingly, outstanding total advances to the Food Commissioner decreased substantially indicating an in-payment of Rs. 960 million in 1982. The overall out-payments on advances to all other govern\u00adment departments amounted to Rs. 139 million leaving Rs. 821 million as net in-pay\u00adments arising from advance account operations of government departments. With regard to advances for stores and materials, the overall position indicated a neutral impact. However, there were compensatory out-payments and in-payments within these accounts. Loans from surplus balances and advance accounts indicated an out-payment of Rs. 81 million resulting from advances mainly to the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (Rs. 72 million), National Textile Corporation (Rs. 30 million) and National Housing Development Authority (Rs. 25 million) partly offset by in-payments arising from Paddy Marketing Board (Rs. 29 million), the Director of Textile Industries (Rs. 15 million) and National Textile Institute (Rs. 15 million). Sri Lanka/China Trade Account recorded an in-payment of Rs. 418 million, brought about by the partial settlement of advances subsequent to the cessation of transactions through the account since the end of 1981. The net advances connected with miscellaneous advance accounts amounted to Rs. 279 million.",

The more than two-fold increase in subscriptions to rupee loans in 1982 was due to varied reasons which contributed to the increase in the availability of investible resources with the major subscribers.

The value of these loans as at 31st December, 1982 amounted to Rs. 12,144 million. In comparison the value of loans contracted in the previous year amounted to Rs. 14,464 million. There has been no improvement during the year in the utilization rate of loans contracted. As at end of 1982, the aggregate utilization rate of the loans contracted since 1970 remained at 50 per cent, as was in 1981. While the level of utilization of project loans was 29 per cent, commodity loans and cash and other loans recorded a very much higher rate of 81 per cent and 84 per cent respectively. It was significant that the more expensive cash loans which were fully utilized in the previous years were not fully utilized in the year under review. Of the Eurocurrency commercial loan of US $ 100 million contracted in 1982, only $ 40 million was utilized during the year. Among other loans, contracted in 1981 there were 5 loans amounting to Rs. 1,544 million on which withdrawals did not commence until the end of 1982.",

    "text": "The monetary scenario in 1982 depicted developments in major monetary variables similar to those in the previous year. The broad money supply (M2) com\u00adprising currency in circulation and the total of demand, time and savings deposits held by the public with commercial banks, grew by Rs. 6,063 million or 25 per cent compared to an increase of Rs. 4,587 million or 23 per cent in 1981. However, a deceleration was evident in the rate of growth in time and savings deposits held by the public with commercial banks (quasi-money). The rate of growth of these de\u00adposits which dropped from 41 per cent in 1980 to 38 per cent in 1981 declined further to 30 per cent in 1982. This was particularly associated with the downward revision in deposit rates by commercial banks in mid 1982, with the interest rates being offered by the National Savings Bank remaining unchanged. Hence, the slight acceleration in M z was largely reflected in the accelerated growth in narrow money supply (Mj) defined as currency and demand deposits held by the public.",
