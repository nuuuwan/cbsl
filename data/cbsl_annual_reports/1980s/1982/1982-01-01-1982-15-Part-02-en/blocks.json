Work on the two refinance credit schemes which have been introduced as a forerunner to a new order of rural development banking continued during the year. They were the Self Employment Refinance Credit Scheme for youths in the Matara District (SES) and the Village Adoption Refinance Credit Scheme (VAS). The SES was formulated to strengthen commercial bank lending to small scale individual projects across the District while VAS was intended to popularise the concept of rural integrated development banking. Both schemes generally emphasized on self employment activities while VAS operations were directed more towards mass work, collective effort and a multi agency approach for overall development of selected villages with bank assistance. As a pilot project, Uda Aparekka and Radampola were chosen under this Scheme.",

In achieving this goal the Regional Office is expected to create a suitable atmosphere on the one hand by identifying development potential, problems of development lending, finding solutions and provide necessary assistance and guidance to the banking sector, while on the other hand by attempting to change the present faulty attitudes among the rural people towards the banking sector, thereby eliminating the unsatisfactory banking practices and habits through a continuous dialogue with them. It was felt that this exercise would ultimately lead to narrowing the ever widening gap between the rural people and the banker and so building a healthy banking structure for the development of the rural sector.",
