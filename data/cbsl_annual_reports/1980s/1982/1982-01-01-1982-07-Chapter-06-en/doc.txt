In 1982, employment in government departments, semi-government insti­tutions (public co-operations and statutory boards) and the organised private sector (private enterprises contributing to the Employees Provident Fund) increased about 34,000' or 2.V per cent. This-increase in employment excludes the unorganised sectors such as traditional agricultural, mining and quarrying, self employed and construction. ;

In the semi-government sector, the creation of new job opportunities amounted to 4,035 compared with 9,077 in 1981. This is only a 0.52 per cent increase compared to an 1.2 per cent increase in 1981.

•.; Employment in the organised private sector increased by 25,625 this year when compared to'26,156in 1981. * (provisional Employees Provident Fund data). Enterprises coming under the Greater Colombo - Economic Commission increased employment by 5,005 in 1982, bringing the total number presently employed in GCEC organisations to 24,926.persons. The employment level in the organised private sector reveals a significant increase compared to that of government and semi-govern­ment employment. Decisions.taken to limit government expenditure, within the budget allocation and limitations, imposed on credit expansion in the semiTgovernment sector may well be some of the reasons limiting increase in employment in these sectors....:. -A"- V . »,.'.'. . ..-
