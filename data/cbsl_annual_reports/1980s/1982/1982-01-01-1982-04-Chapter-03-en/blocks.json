This drop in production was evident in all three elevational categories, with low-grown areas reporting the lowest decline of 5.8 million kgs. or 8*3 per cent. High and mid-grown areas reported a decline of 8.8 million kgs. (10.9, per cent) and 7.7 million kgs. (13.0 percent), respectively. According to information furnished Jjy the Tea Board, production by Janatha Estates Development-Boards (JEDBs) declined by 10.4 million kgs. or 13.2 percent while that of Sri Lanka State Plah'tations Corporations (SLSPCs) dropped by 6.6 million kgs. or 10.3 per cent from the levels recorded in 1981. These figures relate only to production from leaf obtained from the estates belonging to these institutions. Production from'bought leaf'decreased by 7.5 per cent (0.5 million kgs.) in the case of the JEDBs and by 12.2 per cent (1.8 million kgs.), in the case of, the SLSPCs. The distribution of the decline in total tea production in 1982 by quarters was highly uneven, with the first quarter of the year accounting for 10.8 million kgs. or 48 per cent of the decline. This distributional pattern indicates that the severe drought that prevailed in the first quarter of 1982 adversely affected tea production during the year.",

Thus, the fall in production appears to have stemmed primarily from the decline-in the average yield rather than from the lower extent in bearing during the year. More reliable data available in respect of the SLSPCs and JEDBs tend to confirm this hypothesis. The average yield per hectare dropped by 7 per cent and 6 per cent in the case of JEDBs and SLSPCs, respectively, when compared with the previous year. Meanwhile, according to the available raw data, the national average yield is estimated to have declined by about 10 per cent in 1982.

This was increased again to Rs.3.10per kg. in May, 1982 to improve their margins further. At the same time, since the cost of processing green leaf into made tea rose primarily owing to the higher electricity charges, the amount deductible as manufacturing charges for pro\u00adcessing of bought green leaf of private holdings by the factories coming under the 'Price Support Measure Scheme' (PSMS) was increased in May, 1982 from Rs. 6.12 per kg. to Rs. 6.50 per kg.",

Evidently, market imperfections are a major factor constraining the development of the tea smallholdings in the country. Also, as noted in the previous year's Annual Report another important constraint is the lack of easy access to institutional credit for these growers. Several micro-level studies have shown that tea smallholders depend almost entirely on non-institutional sources for their credit needs. This heavy dependency appears to have significantly reduced the bargaining power of the smallholders in the green leaf market, thereby resulting in lower bought leaf prices.",

One of these, Neluwa-Medagama factory in the Hiniduma electorate where smallholders were faced with a severe problem of lack of processing facilities, was opened in March, 1982. Considerable progress was also made in the construction activities of the other four factories being built in the Hiniduma electorate, one of which is scheduled to be commissioned in early 1983. Also, partially fulfilling a long-felt need, the TSHDA has taken steps to strengthen its limited extension staff for the benefit of the small\u00adholders. Although it is important to build new factories in areas where serious shortages of factory capacity exist, the TSHDA should not try to pursue this policy too far, given the constraints of funds. Perhaps, it may be more beneficial to the smallholders in the country if the TSHDA places greater emphasis on improving extension services and fertilizer distribution together with the marketing facilities available to them. A concerted effort to introduce a comprehensive credit scheme for the smallholders with the co-operation of commercial banks could also; prove useful.

Since the JEDBs and SLSPCs, which together account for about 32 percent of the total extent under rubber, reported a fall in average yield on their estates by 1 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, it appears that yield on the privately owned rubber lands has improved significantly during 1982.",

However, the JEDBs and SLSPCs each reported a greater decrease of 1,100 metric tons in the amount of fertilizer application. Consequently, it appears that issues to the private sector increased. The available data indicate that although the private sector accounts for nearly 68 per cent of the total extent under rubber, it accounts for only about one third of the total amount of fertilizer used in the rubber sector. Evidently, the bulk of the private owners do not use any fertilizer at all on mature rubber lands. Thus, given the fairly high positive correlation between fertilizer application and average yield, improved fertilizer use in the private sector rubber lands, deserves to be given greater attention.",

Incorrect tapping methods adopted by many smallholders seem to reduce the long term latex yield and the productive life-span of trees. Also crude methods of processing of latex adopted by many smallholders together with market imperfections appear to lower the quality as well as the price. In this respect, there is an urgent need to revive the scheme of group processing of smallholders' rubber and rehabilitate the already existing group processing centres in various rubber producing areas. It is doubtful whether the smallholder sector can be placed on a sustainable growth path without such group activities involving both the smallholders themselves and the service institutes, such as the Rubber Research Institute. Unlike in the previous year, the local consumption of rubber showed only a marginal increase from 16.2 million kgs. in 1981 to 16.5 million kgs. in 1982. However, there appears to exist ample scope for expansion of rubber based industries in the country to boost export earnings from rubber. The realization of this potential, however, depends to a large extent, upon the incentives that would be provided to such industries.",

This achievement was prima\u00adrily due to the fact that the coconut growing areas experienced favourable weather conditions during the latter part of 1981 and the last three quarters of 1982. The liberalization of controls that characterised the coconut export trade also contributed to the positive response exhibited by producers.

The Price Support Scheme for DC was introduced in September, 1982 at the special request of DC millers shortly after the decline in production commenced. There was, however, insufficient time for the scheme to have any definite impact on production, because it was implemented somewhat late in the year. Under this scheme, desiccated coconut millers were supported by a grant of Rs. 1,000 per metric ton of DC of exportable quality manufactured by them. The millers in turn were required to ensure that the producers from whom they purchase nuts received at least Rs. 1,000 per 1,000 nuts. In November, 1982, this scheme was revised, increasing the grant given to D.C. millers to Rs. 2,000 per metric ton as millers were reportedly unable to ensure the rninimum price to producers at the rate specified earlier.",

It is essential to move away from the traditional view of coconut lands as strictly monocultural holdings.

The total extent underplanted and replanted at 3,543 hectares, having shown a considerable improvement (a 30 per cent increase) in 1981, remained approximately at the 1980 level during 1982. Subsidy payments for this purpose declined marginally from Rs. 13.7 nullion in 1981 to Rs. 12.9 million in 1982. Newly planted area, which more than doubled from 1980 to 1981, rose only marginally by less than 1 per cent in 1982, from 5,259 hectares in 1981 to 5,291 hectares. Subsidy payments for new planting rose by 12 per cent to Rs. 15.5 million. It appears that planting and rehabilitation activities during the year have stagnated somewhat in comparison to the increasing trend shown in the previous year. As mentioned in last year's Annual Report too, this is unfortunate in the light of the substantial ex ent of coconut land that has gone out of production due to senility, accelerated development activities and the cyclone in 1978. Unless a more concerted effort to maintain and accelerate replanting and new planting activities is made, the production base for the future would be severely undermined.",

In fact, there is ample room for expansion of crops such as cocoa, coffee and pepper as intercrops in coconut lands and several other minor export crops as intercrops in rubber lands. Undoubtedly, a system of mixed cropping in these lands, if properly done, could be more economical than a system of monocropping. Such a system could also lead to more employment and better utilization of scarce land resources in the country. In this respect, JEDBs and SLSPCs which together manage about 270,000 hectares of tea, rubber and coconut lands can play a major role.",

During the previous Maha season, the extent sown in both rainfed areas and the areas under minor irrigation recorded decreases of 3 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, while the extent sown in areas under major irrigation increased by 4 per cent. The difference between the sown and harvested extent in 1982 was 98,515 hectares, or 12 per cent of the gross sown extent. This is more than double that of the corresponding figure for the pre\u00advious cultivation year which was 40,121 hectares or 5 per cent of the gross sown extent. For Maha, 1981/82 this difference was 89,096 hectares or 16 per cent of the extent sown during the season. In Yala, 1982 this difference amounted to only 3 per cent of the extent sown. The substantial increase in the incidence of crop failure during 1982 was primarily the result of the severe drought that prevailed during the first quarter, which took its toll of the Maha harvest.",

However, the PMB appears to have played an important role as a floor price operator, preventing a sharp fall in prices below GPS prices during harvesting seasons, particularly in surplus districts. The PMB commenced large, scale milling in July, to enable it to have sufficient stocks to counteract the expected increases in the price of rice during the last quarter of the year. Further, the PMB sold a substantial quantity of rice through mobile units as well as transferred stocks to the Food Commissioner in the last quarter. The prices of all qualities of rice are reported to have increased by only 4 per cent, on average, from the first to the latter half of 1982. In 1981, over the same period, the corresponding increase was 12 percent. There is some evidence to indicate that the PMB contributed to\u00adwards arresting the increase in prices which usually occurs over this period.",

There are signs that the increase in prices has promoted the efficient use of fertilizer particularly in the paddy sector. It is important to intensify research on fertilizer to determine whether locally available less costly materials can be used as substitutes for Costly imported varieties of fertilizer. In this regard, it is encouraging to note that researchers at the Central Agricultural Research Institute have found that paddy straw is an efficient substitute for Muriate of Potash. Policy makers should promptly introduce measures to induce farmers to make use of findings of this nature which not only lower COP but also save a considerable amount of foreign exchange, reducing the country's dependence on imported fertilizer.",

An attempt was made to improve the margin given to retailers, which deteriorated in 1981, by increasing the commission paid to them by Rs. 30 per metric ton, The financial assistance scheme to promote construction at the retail level by the Multi-Purpose Co-operative Societies and the private sector fertilizer stores was in operation during 1982 as well.

Production in the coastal sector, and the deep sea and off-shore sector increased by 1 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. The increase in the produc\u00adtion of these sectors was associated with the mechanization of existing traditional crafts and utilization of new and more efficient fishing gear. However, higher fuel cost may be the crucial factor which affected the lower rate of growth of production in these sectors. Production in the inland sector also registered a 4 per cent increase. This reflects the impact of the state sponsored development programme which emphasised the importance of inland fishing. Continued growth in inland fishing is a healthy development owing to its relatively low energy intensity and the low unit cost. Also the rapid development of the inland fisheries sector is likely to reduce fish prices in remote areas and have an impact on the nutritional level of a large segment of the rural population.",

Of this, only Rs. 747 million has been recovered by the end of 1982. Similarly, of the Rs. 439 million granted for the cultivation of other crops during the same period, only Rs. 218 million has been recovered. Thus, high rates of default continue to be an unsatisfactory feature of rural lending. In 1982, only Rs. 86.2 million of the Rs. 150.4 million disbursed during the 1981/82 cultivation year was recovered, resulting in the deterioration of the recovery rates for both paddy and minor food crops when compared to the previous year. The substantial losses incurred during Maha 1981/82 as a result of the drought may partly account for this deterioration. This experience highlights the need for an efficient crop insurance scheme or a stabilization fund to provide refinacing for bank loans which require rescheduling, in those situations where crop failures due to natural calamities are the primary cause for high rates of default. In fact, the establishment of a National Agricultural Credit Fund was under active consideration by the Rural Credit Advisory Board (RCAB) in 1982.",

This scheme was inaugurated with the intent of giving farmers an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves and become eligible for new loans, as well as initiate dialogue between commercial banks and delinquent borrowers, breaking the stalemate that existed under an earlier decision by .commercial banks to prosecute them for the recovery of loans. Under the scheme, a farmer who has defaulted can become eligible for a new loan by initially paying 10 per cent of the overdue loan (which has been consolidated and frozen as at June 30th, 1981) along with interest at 9 per cent per annum up to June 30th, 1981. Thereafter, at each harvesting season he is expected to repay the balance amount of the loan over a period of 5 years. In addition, in the case of farmers who pay the first seven instalments regularly, the scheme provides for the waiver of the last three instalments. The deadline for submitting applications for rescheduling which was September 30th, 1982 has been extended to April 30th, 1983 with the intention that improved publicity would encourage more farmers to respond to the scheme.",
