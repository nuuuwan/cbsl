This represents a continuation of the increasing trend in the wage rates in paddy farming observed since 1979. The daily wage rate for male workers in the tea, rubber and coconut cultivation sectors too increased. The increase in the case of workers in the coconut cultivation sector was the most pronounced while that for the rubber sector showed the lowest increases.

The rate of growth of exports in SDR terms was only 0.6 per cent in 1982 as compared to a 13 per cent growth in 1981. On the other hand, imports grew at a faster rate of 13 per cent in 1982 as against a 2 per cent growth registered in 1981. The higher rate of growth of imports in 1982 was very largely due to the purchase of ships (SDR 44 million) and aircraft (SDR 107 million) during the year, which resulted in a bulging of investment goods imports for the year. The higher growth of imports in 1982 has therefore to be viewed in this context.",
