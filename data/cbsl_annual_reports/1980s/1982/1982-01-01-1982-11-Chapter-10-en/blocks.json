    "text": "The activities performed by the co-operative societies and the Food Com\u00admissioner's Department (FCD), in the internal trade of the country underwent drastic changes under the liberalized system of trade. Due to the increased availability of goods at competitive prices (in the open market), the dependence of the consumers on co-operatives for their day to day needs was no longer a necessity. This could be seen from the marked decrease-in the turnover of the co-operatives from Rs. 9,870 million in 1981 to Rs. 8,320 million in 1982, a fall of 16 percent. Yet, a majority of the low income earners preferred to use co-operatives as the major source of supply for their needs, since the co-operatives handled the bulk of the items distributed under the Food Stamp Scheme. In 1982 the co-operative societies continued to handle the Food Stamp Scheme. According to estimates based on a Central Bank Survey, despite a reduction in the turnover, the co-operative sector was able to achieve an increased margin of 6 per cent in 1982 as against 4 per cent in 1981 over the costs of its purchases.",

During the year, the private sector was able to handle the bulk of the trade in locally produced rice and sugar. The volume of imports of sugar by the Food Commissioner's Department decreased by more than 94 per cent, while the FCD's purchases of rice from the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) decreased by 87 per cent in 1982. At the same time, the purchase of paddy by the PMB from producers declined by 34 per cent. This reveals the major role played by the private sector in the rice and sugar trade. However, FCD continued to-be the sole importer of wheat grain for milling at the Prima Mills and was the sole distributor of wheat flour.",

Meanwhile, the annual room occupancy rate in the graded accommodation sector which reached a peak of 57 per cent in 1980 has since declined to 47.8 per cent in 1982. Although the number of tourists arriving in the country has been increasing annually, there has been a drop in the occupancy rate in the graded accommodation sector which implies that tourists are increasingly patronising accommodation outside the graded sector. Heavy reliance of the Sri Lankan tourist industry on the Western European market is a basic structural weakness of the industry and a concerted effort is required to diversify the sources of tourist traffic with a view to overcoming the problem of its vulnerability to significant changes in traffic from this region. Another important issue is the diversion of patronage from the graded accommodation to lower cost accommodation presumably due to high prices. This in turn may have something to do with taxes currently imposed on the hotel industry as well as increased costs of electricity & water.",

    "text": "In 1982, the current account deficit of Sri Lanka's balance of payments at Rs. 11,793 million (SDR 515 million) was the highest on record. In comparison, the deficit in 1981 was Rs. 8,342 million (SDR 375 million). The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP increased from 11 per cent in 1981 to 13 per cent in 1982. These movements compare unfavourably with the developments in 1981, when the current account deficit declined by 26 per cent, and its share in GDP by 4 percentage points. The deterioration of the current account balance in the year under review is attributable to the sluggish growth in exports against a faster growth in imports and a considerable reduction in net service receipts, particularly due to high interest payments on foreign borrowings. The net inflow of non-monetary capital in 1982 was Rs. 9,885 million (SDR 431 million), reflecting a 26 per cent increase (in SDR terms) over the corresponding figure for 1981. As a result, despite the record current account deficit, the overall balance was contained below the 1981 level (SDR 24 million in 1982 as against SDR 26 million in the previous year). During the year, the country's net international reserves declined to the extent of the overall deficit. Gross external assets, however, increased by 20 per cent to reach Rs. 10,956 million (SDR 466 million) at the end of the year. The gross external assets at the end of 1982 were adequate to finance 3 months' imports projected for 1983.",
