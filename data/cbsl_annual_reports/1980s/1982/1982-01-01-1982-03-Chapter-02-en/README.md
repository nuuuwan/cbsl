GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

Overall Trends

Sri Lanka's Gross National Product (GNP) at current factor cost prices is provisionally estimated at Rs. 89.7 billion in 1982. This is an increase of 15.5 per cent compared with the previous year. When allowance is made for price increases, the real increase in GNP is 4.9 per cent in 1982 compared with 4.1 per cent in the previous year. The implicit change in the GNP deflator for 1982 on which this observation is made is estimated at 10.2 per cent. This is substantially lower than the comparable rates in the previous two years.

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measured at 1970 constant prices on the other hand increased from Rs. 20.7 billion in 1981 to Rs. 21.8 billion in 1982. This represents a growth rate of 5.1 per cent. The net outflow of factor income at constant prices increased at a lower rate (14 per cent) in 1982 compared with a nearly 300 per cent increase in 1981. Hence, the rate of growth of the real GNP at 4.9 per cent is only marginally less than that of the Gross Domestic Product. In the previous year while the GDP grew at 5.8 per cent, the GNP growth was held back on account of a higher rate of increase in net outflow of factor income to 4.1 percent.

The G.D.P. was estimated at Rs. 91.6 billion at current prices in 1982. This is a 15.5 per cent growth over the previous year. The net outflow of factor income abroad in 1982 has been Rs. 1,969 million at current prices compared with Rs. 1,712 million in the previous year. In real terms however, the net outflow of factor income abroad was Rs. 510 million in 1982, compared with Rs. 449 million in 1981.

According to the data made available by the Registrar General's Department, Sri Lanka's population in 1982 increased by 1.7 per cent. The mid-year population in 1982 was 15.2 million compared with 15.0millionin 1981. Hence the per capita, GNP at current prices in 1982 has been estimated at Rs. 5,904 (US $ 284) compared with Rs. 5,179 (US $ 267) in 1981. In real terms this is an increase of 3.5 per cent in the current year compared with the 2.4 per cent increase in per capita income in the previous year.

Since the new economic policies were introduced five years ago, the dynamic sectors in the economy have been trade, services, transport and construction. After very high rates of activity, the construction sector has recorded a decline for the second successive year. However, other sectors have continued to expand, although at a reduced rate. The manufacturing sector has shown moderate growth in 1982. The agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors which had been primarily responsible for the growth in 1981 through their combined high growth rate of 6.9 per cent has expanded by 2.6 per cent in 1982. In the tree crop sub-sector, the output of coconut has increased by about 11 per cent. The rubber sub-sector has recorded a marginal growth while the tea sub-sector has experienced a 10.7 percent drop in value added. In the food crop sector, the value added in paddy has declined by 3.4 per cent in 1982.

The manufacturing, mining and utility services have expanded by 5.0 per cent. The value added in processing of tea has declined while the manufacturing sector industries have recorded a growth in value added. The export of manufactured goods has increased substantially during 1982 while the index of production in major corporations has shown a 5 per cent growth.

The construction sector which started to decline in 1981 but has continued in the same direction by recording a negative growth of about 2 per cent in 19S2. There was an increase in construction activities in the public sector; but for this the decline in the construction sector would have been larger. The growth in trade, transport and other services has been about 6.9 per cent.

Sectoral Performance in 1982

The growth trends in various sectors for the period 1978-1982 are given in Table 1.7. The agricultural sector which had been the main growth agent in 1981 has suffered a serious set-back in 1982. The marginal increase in value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing sector in 1982 was only about 40 per cent of what was realized in 1981. In 1981 this sector contributed 29 per cent to GDP growth as against a 13 per cent contribution in 1982. The value added in tea has declined by 10.7 per cent in 1982. The value added in paddy which had a continuous record of expansion since 1978 has declined by 3.4 per cent in 1982. In spite of the negative growth rates in tea and paddy sub-sectors, the agricultural sector including forestry and fishing has increased by 2.6 per cent in 1982. The fisheries sector has expanded by 2.9 per cent in 1982 compared with a 15 per cent growth in the previous year.

The mining and quarrying sector is estimated to have expanded by 4.1 per cent in 1982. Graphite production has increased by 18.1 per cent in 1982 while the value added from gemming sub-sector has declined reflecting the trend in gem exports. The demand emanating from construction activities in the public sector seems to have helped the quarrying sub-sector to some extent. However, the slowing down of private sector house construction has.resulted in a reduced demand for building materials of the quarrying sector such as bricks and sand.

The value added in the manufacturing sector has increased by 4.8 per cent in 1982. The decline in output of tea has reduced the value added in the agro-proces­sing sub-sector by 5.3 per cent. However, factory and other industries have grown faster in 1982. The value of industrial exports has shown a steady increase in 1982. The export of manufactured goods, excluding petroleum products has increased by 17.6 per cent in 1982 over the previous year.

In the consrtuction sector, building activities in private residential housing has continued to decline in 1982. However, because of the large volume of construction work undertaken in the public sector, particularly in the Mahaveli Development Programme, the overall decline in the construction sector was limited to about 2 per cent.

A growth rate of about 10 per cent has been recorded in the electricity, gas, water and sanitary services sector. The electricity output has shown an increase of 10.4 per cent in 1982.

The value added contribution in the transport, storage and communication sector increased by 6.2 per cent in 1982, despite a set-back in investment, in the first half of the year. However, after the re-introduction of the tax concession of Lump: Sum Depreciation (LSD), transport sector activities expanded and value added increased significantly.

The wholesale and retail trade sector has expanded by 6.0. per cent in 1982, compared with 4.8 per cent in 1981. According to the customs data, merchandise imports have increased by 14.7 per cent in 1982.

The rate of growth in the banking, insurance and real estate sector has slowed down to 12.0 per cent in 1982, compared with 14.9 per cent in the previous two years. The value added in ownership of dwellings was at about the same rate as in 1981, but value added in public administration has increased from 4 per cent to 10.5 per cent.

Other services have grown by about 7 per cent in 1982 compared with an 8 per cent growth in 1981. The tourist sub-sector which is responsible for a large >share in the other services sector, has expanded relatively slowly by about 10 percent.

The growth of the Sri Lanka economy in 1982 has apparently slowed down as a result of poor performance in the agricultural sector. The decline in the paddy sub-sector was largely due to the adverse weather condition during the Maha season. This sub-sector has been growing continuously for the last-four years. The tea sub-sector too has performed very poorly in 1982. The reduced tea output has had the effect of reducing the value added in the agro-processing sector too. .

The effect of international terms of trade on the Sri Lanka economy continu'co* to,be adverse in 1982. In 1982, Sri Lanka lost about 8 per cent of its GNP due to adverse terms of trade, compared with the 7 per cent loss in 1981. The 1978 based terms of trade index declined to 38 in 1982 from' 46 in 1981. After making allowances for the terms of trade effect, the real national income is estimated to have increased by 3.6 per cent in 1982 as against 3.2 per cent in 1981. The estimates of real national income are given in the Statistical Appendix.

Expenditure Pattern

The Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) at current prices is estimated at Rs. 118.7 billion in 1982, which is 20 per cent higher than in 1981. The totalconsump-tion expenditure in 1982 amounted to Rs. 88.2 billion ; of this Rs. 80 billion was spent '6n private consumption while Rs. 8.2 billion was spent on government consumption. The Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF) which inchides stocks, amounted to Rs. 30.5 billion, a 29.0 per cent increase over the previous year.

( 24 )

The Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation (GDFC) amounted to Rs. 30.2 billion an increase of 29.9 per cent over the previous year at current market prices. The GDFC in the combined sector of public corporations and private sector recorded an increase of 32.0 per cent in 1982 to reach the level of Rs. 25.2 billion. The GDFC by the government sector increased by about 21.0 per cent to reach the value of Rs. 5.0 billion.

The value of capital goods imports increased by about 48 per cent in 1982 as against a 1.3 per cent decline in 1981. The import value of major capital goods in 1982 has increased by 156 per cent as against a 27 per cent decline in 1981. This increase was largely on account of the imports of ships and aircraft during the year.

The import content in Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation which had been relatively high, in the range of 37 per cent during 1978-1980 had declined sub­stantially in 1981. In 1982, however, it has once again increased to 36.5 per cent.

Availability and Utilization of Resources

The total resource availability in 1982, valued at current" prices has been Rs. 147.0 billion, an increase of 18.0 per cent over the previous year. The economy received Rs. 100.3 billion worth of resources from domestic production and Rs. 46.7 billion worth of resources from the external sector. The share of the external sector in resource availability at 31.8 per cent was the same as in 1981. In the utilization of resources, consumption has absorbed 60.0 percent in 1982 as against 60.2 per cent in 1981. Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation has increased by 20.6 per cent in 1982 as against 18.7 per cent in 1981. The share of exports in the total resource use is estimated at 19.3 per cent in 1982.

The total resource availability, valued at constant prices has increased by 4.1 per cent in 1982. Imports have increased by 2.1 per cent in 1982. The resource availabiUty from the domestic economy has increased by 5.1 per cent as against 5.8 per cent in 1981. Consumption expenditure, valued at constant prices has increased by 1.9 per cent in 1982, while capital formation has increased by 5.8 per cent in 1982 as against 2.6 per cent in 1981. The exports of the economy have increased by 9.8 per cent in 1982 over the previous year.

Domestic Savings in 1982, excluding net factor income from abroad and private remittances are estimated at Rs. 12.1 billion. The domestic savings ratio has improved to 12.1 per cent in 1982 from 11.7 per cent in 1981. The total national savings which included net outflow of factor income and private transfers from abroad, have amounted to Rs. 15.3 billion.

AGRICULTURE

In 1982 the agricultural sector was unable to maintain the impressive growth record achieved in the previous year. The sector as a whole, including forestry and fishing sub-sectors, grew by only 2.6 per cent in the year, as against 6.9 per cent growth achieved in the preceding year.

Tea ,

Tea production in 1982 has been estimated at 187.8 million kgs. which indicates a decline of 22.3,million kgs. or 10.6 per cent when compared with the production in 1981. This drop in production was evident in all three elevational categories, with low-grown areas reporting the lowest decline of 5.8 million kgs. or 8*3 per cent. High and mid-grown areas reported a decline of 8.8 million kgs. (10.9, per cent) and 7.7 million kgs. (13.0 percent), respectively. According to information furnished Jjy the Tea Board, production by Janatha Estates Development-Boards (JEDBs) declined by 10.4 million kgs. or 13.2 percent while that of Sri Lanka State Platitations Corporations (SLSPCs) dropped by 6.6 million kgs. or 10.3 per cent from the levels recorded in 1981. These figures relate only to production from leaf obtained from the estates belonging to these institutions. Production from'bought leaf'decreased by 7.5 per cent (0.5 million kgs.) in the case of the JEDBs and by 12.2 per cent (1.8 million kgs.), in the case of, the SLSPCs. The distribution of the decline in total tea production in 1982 by quarters was highly uneven, with the first quarter of the year accounting for 10.8 million kgs. or 48 per cent of the decline. This distributional pattern indicates that the severe drought that prevailed in the first quarter of 1982 adversely affected tea production during the year.
