Reflec\u00adting the increase in volume and changes in exchange rates, the rupee value of petroleum imports in 1982 increased by 22 per cent while in SDR terms it indicated an increase of 20 per cent over the corresponding figure of 1981. A more disconcerting feature is that the petroleum import bill absorbed 67 per cent of the earnings from'non-petroleum exports in 1982 as compared with 56 per cent in the previous year. The value of petroleum exports which increased progressively during the past few years declined by 3 per cent and 4 per cent in terms of Rupees and SDRs respectively due to increased domestic consumption of exportable oil products, namely heavy diesel and naphtha. This loss was partly compensated for, by the export of urea by the Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation which used naphtha as its main.input in the manufacture. In addition there were no imports of urea during the yeaf. The net oil import bill rose from 32 percent of the total export earnings in 1981 to 41 per cent in the current year.",

The declining trend observed in the consumption of kerosene during the past few years appears to have reversed. \u2022 The consumption of kerosene increased by 3.5 per cent during the current year. The rate of growth of auto diesel consumption which dropped from 14 per cent in 1980 to'6 per cent in 1981 has regis* tered a rate of growth of 5.5 per cent in the current year. Consumption of heavy diesel which rose at an unprecedented rate of 67 per cent in 1981 due, to increased thermal power generation by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) continued to increase at the rate of 59 per cent in 1982. Consumption of furnace oil which rose with the expansion of industrial activities during the recent past, has indicated a marginal decrease during the year under review. The drop in furnace oil consumption was caused mainly by the reduced use of this product by the Cement and Steel Corporations in 1982. The former corporation switched to coal as a substitute fuel in the operation of its phase III in 1982. . u",

However, the demand for electricity grew at a rate of 12 per cent outstripping the increased rate of supply. The installed capacity of the CEB during the year under review increased by 12 per cent mainly due to the commissioning of three gas turbines with a capacity of 20 mW each. This enabled the CEB to supply electricity throughout the year although at higher costs,- without resort to power cuts. Nevertheless, if additional electricity demand is to be satisfied through thermal power generation it would no doubt bring about a severe strain on our balance of payments, apart from resulting in increased costs.",

This slackening in activity started in the previous year and was principally due to resource constraints and the escalation in the cost of construction. The National Housing Development Authority is entrusted with the responsibility for implementing the government's programme for public housing. The public sector housing programme has been pruned down due to severe liquidity problems as a result of budgetary constraints and less than anticipated cost recoveries. Cost over-runs due to the increase in construction costs (raw materials as well as labour) and a shortage in skilled labour and management also hindered progress. The approach adopted in 1982 as in 1981, therefore, was the pursuit of low cost housing projects such as Aided Self Help Programme which is aimed at pro\u00adviding houses for low income groups. This type of project with its reliance on local raw materials, techniques and one's own labour is also likely to reduce the pressure on overall construction costs. . Hence, there was a shift from high cost projects to projects that were less expensive in order to keep within the limited resources available. This is evidenced by the fact that no Direct Construction type houses or Public Servants'Quarters were embarked upon in 1982.",

In 1982, there were 1,245 new building approvals by the CMC compared with 1,140 approvals in 1981 indica\u00adting a 9 per cent increase in overall terms. New residential building (houses and flats,) approvals totalled 589 in 1982 compared with 530 in 1981 representing a 11 per cent increase in this field. In this category while housing approvals increased by 26 per cent, approvals in respect of flats declined. The other major category, non-residential new building approvals (commercial, industrial, schools etc.)increased by 43 per cent over the previous year. In this category, industrial building approvals increased by 150 per cent whereas commercial building approvals declined. Of the 1,245 building approvals, 43 per cent were for ?.dditions and alterations reflecting the tendency to minimise on land costs and modernise and expand existing facilities. It is also likely that the location of construction activity in respect of new residential, commercial and industrial buildings would have shifted to sub-urban areas due to the shortage and high price of buildable land in Colombo.",
