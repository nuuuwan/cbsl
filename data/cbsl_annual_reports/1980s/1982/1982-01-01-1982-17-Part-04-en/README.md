CHAPTER XIV

RECOVERY OF DUTY

44. In this Chapter "duty" includes stamp duty and any sum added to any such duty and any fines, penalties, fees or costs, whatsoever, incurred under this Act.

45. (1) The duty required to be paid by any notice issued under section 30 (1) (b) shall be paid on or before the date specified in such notice, and, subject to the provisions of subsection (2), any duty not so paid shall be deemed to be in default and the person by whom such duty is payable shall be deemed to be a defaulter for the purposes of this Act.

( XLIX )

(2) Where duty payable every quarter under section 13 is not paid on or before the date specified therein, such duty together with a penalty equal to ten per centum of the duty for every month of non-payment shall be deemed to be in default and the person liable to pay the duty shall be deemed to be a defaulter :

Provided that the total amount payable as penalty shall not exceed fifty per centum of the duty in default.

(3) Duty shall be paid, notwithstanding any appeal unless the Commissioner-General orders that payment of the duty or any part thereof be held over, pending the determination of such appeal, and upon such order, the amount held over shall be deemed not to be in default.

(4) Where the Commissioner-General is of opinion either that the duty or any part thereof held over under subsection (3) is likely to become irrecoverable, or that the appellant is unreasonably delaying the prosecution of his appeal, he may revoke any order made under that subsection and make such fresh order as the case may appear to him to require and the amount of any duty not paid on or befoie such date as may be specified in the fresh order shall be deemed to be in default.

(5) Where upon the final determination of an appeal under Chapter XIII or upon any order made by the Commissioner-General, any duty which has been held over under subsection (3) becomes payable or the duty payable under a notice is increased, the Commissioner-General shall give to the appellant a notice in writing fixing a date on or before which any duty or balance duty shall be paid. Any duty not paid before such date shall be deemed to be in default.

46. Any duty in default shall be a first charge upon all the assets of the defaulter :

Provided that—

(i) such charge shall not extend to, or affect, any assets sold by the defaulter to a bona fide purchaser for value prior to the seizure of the same in accor­dance with the provisions of section 48 ; and

(ii) as regards immovable property, the amount in default shall not rank in priority to any lease or encumbrance created bona fide for value and registered prior to the date of such seizure.

47. (1) Where any duty is in default, the Commissioner-General shall, before proceeding to recover such duty in any manner hereinafter provided, issue a notice in writing to the defaulter stating—

(a) the particulars of such duty ; and

(b) that action is being contemplated to recover the duty.

( L )

(2) If such defaulter has not appealed within the proper time against any notice under section 30 (1) (b) he may, within thirty days of the date of the notice issued under subsection (1) of this section, make any objection to the duty so charged and the Commissioner-General shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 42, consider such objections and give his decision thereon which shall be final.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this section, where there is an appeal against a notice under section 30(1) (b) and the payment of any duty specified in such notice is held over on the order of the Commissioner-General and the appellant agrees, during the course of the hearing of that appeal, that a certain sum is due or is likely to be due as duty in respect of that notice, the Commissioner-General may, by notice in writing given to the appellant, direct the appellant to pay such sum on or before such date as is specified in the notice. Any sum not paid before such date shall be deemed to be in default.

(4) Where upon the final determination of an appeal under Chapter XIII any stamp duty in default is reduced, the penalty payable in respect of such stamp duty shall be proportionately reduced.

48. (1) There shall be appointed stamp duty collectors for the purposes of this Act.

(2) (a) Where any duty is in default, the Commissioner-General may issue a certificate to a Government Agent, Assistant Government Agent, Fiscal, Deputy Fiscal or stamp duty collector containing particulars of such duty and the name of the defaulter, and the officer to whom such ceritficate is issued is hereby empowered and required to cause the duty to be recovered from the defaulter named in the certificate by seizure and sale of his movable property.

(b) A seizure of movable property shall be effected in such manner as such officer shall deem most expedient in that behalf, and as soon as any movable property is seized by such officer a fist of such property shall forthwith be made and signed by him and shall be given to the defaulter and a copy thereof furnished to the Commissioner-General.

(c) Where the property so seized is—

(i) cash in Sri Lanka currency, such cash shall be applied in satisfaction of the duty in default;

(ii) cash in foreign currency, such cash shall be deposited in the Central Bank and the proceeds therefrom applied in satisfaction of the duty in default;

(iii) property other than cash, such property shall be kept for five days at the costs and charges of the defaulter. If the defaulter does not pay the duty in default together with the costs and charges within the five days, the Government Agent, Assistant Government Agent,

( LI )

Fiscal, Deputy Fiscal, or stamp duty collector shall cause such pro­perty to be sold by public auction or where such property is a negotia­ble instrument or a share in any corporation or public company, to be sold through a broker at the market rate of the day.

(d) The sum realized by the sale referred to in sub-paragraph (iii) shall be applied—

(i) firstly, in payment of the costs and charges of seizing, keeping and selling the property ; and

(ii) secondly, in satisfaction of the duty in default, and any balance shall be paid to the owner of the property seized.

(3) Where any duty is in default and the Commissioner-General is of opinion that recovery by the means provided in subsection (2) is impracticable or inexpedient, he may issue a certificate to a District Court having jurisdiction in any district where the defaulter resides or in which any property, movable or immovable, owned by the defaulter is situate, containing particulars of such duty and the name or names of the person or persons by whom the duty is payable, and the court shall thereupon direct a writ of execution to issue to the Fiscal authorizing and requiring him to seize and sell all or any of the property, movable or immovable, of the defaulter, or such part thereof as he may deem necessary for recovery of the duty, and the provisions of sections 226 to 297 of the Civil Procedure Code shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to such seizure and sale.

(4) Whenever the Commissioner-General issues a certificate under this section, he shall forthwith issue to the defaulter, whether resident or non-resident, a notification thereof by personal service, or registered letter sent through the post, or telegraph ; but the non-receipt of such notification by the defaulter shall not invalidate procee­dings under this section.

49. (1) Where the Commissioner-General is of the opinion in any case that recovery of duty in default by seizure and sale is impracticable or inexpedient or where full duty has not been recovered by seizure and sale, he may issue a certificate containing particulars of such duty and the name and last known place of residence of the defaulter to a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the division in which such place is situate.

The Magistrate shall thereupon summon such defaulter before him to show cause why further proceedings for the recovery of duty should not be taken against him, and in default of sufficient cause being shown, the duty in default shall be deemed to be a fine imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter for an offence punishable with a fine only or not punishable with imprisonment, and the provisions of subsection (1) of section 291 (except paragraphs (a), (d) and (/) thereof) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, relating to default of payment of a fine imposed for such offence shall thereupon apply and the Magistrate may make any direction which, by the provisions of that subsection, he could have made at the time of imposing such sentence.

( Lil )

(2) The correctness of any statement in a certificate issued by the Commissioner-General for the purposes of sub-section (1) shall not be called in question or examined by the Magistrate in any proceedings under this section and accordingly, nothing in that subsection shall be read and construed as authorizing the Magistrate to consider, or decide the correctness of any statement in such certificate or to postpone or defer such proceedings for a period exceeding thirty days by reason only of the fact that an appeal is pending against any notice requiring the payment of the duty in default.

(3) Nothing in subsections (2) to (5) of section 291 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, shall apply in any case referred to in subsection (1) of this section.

(4) In any case referred to in subsection (1) in which the defaulter is sentenced to imprisonment in default of payment of the fine deemed by that subsection to have been imposed on him, the Magistrate may allow time for the payment of the amount of that fine or direct payment of that amount to be made in instalments.

(5) The Court may require bail to be given as a condition precedent to allowing time under subsection (1) for showing cause as therein provided or under subsection (4) for the payment of the fine ; and the provisions of Chapter XXXIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, shall apply where the defaulter is so required to give bail.

(6) Where a Magistrate directs under subsection (4) that a payment be made in instalments and default is made in the payment of any one instalment, proceedings may be taken as if default had been ma.de in payment of all the instalments then remaining unpaid.

(7) In any proceedings under subsection (1), the certificate of the Commis­sioner-General shall be sufficient evidence that the duty has been duly required to be paid and is in default, and any plea that the amount is excessive, incorrect, or under appeal shall not be entertained.

50. (1) Where duty payable by any person is in default and it appears to the Commissioner-General to be probable that any person—

(a) owes or is about to pay money to the defaulter or his agent ; or

(b) holds money for or on account of the defaulter or his agent; or

(c) holds money on account of some other person for payment to the defaulter or his agent; or

(d) has authority from some other person to pay money to the defaulter or his agent,

the Commissioner-General may give to such person notice in writing (a copy of which shall be sent by post to the defaulter) requiring him to pay any such moneys not exceeding the amount of the duty in default to the officer named in such=notice. The

( "II )

notice shall apply to all such moneys which are in his hands or due from him at the date of receipt of such notice, or come into his hands or become due from him or are about to be paid by him at any time within a period of three months after the date of such notice.

(2) Any person who has made any payment in pursuance of this section shall be deemed to have acted under the authority of the defaulter and of all other persons concerned, and is hereby indemnified in respect of such payment against all procee­dings, civil or criminal, notwithstanding the provisions of any written law, contract, or agreement.

(3) Any person to whom a notice has been given under subsection (l)who is unable to comply therewith owing to the fact that the moneys referred to in that subsection do not come into his hands or that no such moneys become due from him within the period referred to in that subsection shall within fourteen days of the expiration thereof give notice in writing to the Commissioner-General apprising him of the facts.

(4) Where any person to whom a notice has been given under subsection (1) is unable to comply therewith and has failed to give notice to the Commissioner-General as provided in subsection (3), or where such person has paid or could have paid the duty to which the notice relates or any part thereof and has not paid over such duty or part thereof as required by the notice given by the Commissioner-General, within fourteen days after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (1), such person shall, if he is an individual, or where such person is a company or body of persons, whether corporate or unincorporatc, the secretary, manager or other prin­cipal officer of such company or body, be personally liable, for the whole of the duty which such person has been required to pay, and such duty may be recovered from such individual, secretary, manager or other principal officer, as the case may be, by all the means provided in this Act.

(5) For the purposes of this section, the expression "defaulter" shall be deemed to include the agent of a person who is in default and the provisions of this section shall apply in any case where the duty which would have been payable by any person if he were alive is in default; and for the purposes of the application of those provisions in any such case, the expression "defaulter" in subsection (1) means—

(a) the executor or administrator of a deceased person ; or

(b) any person who takes possession of, or intermeddles with, the property of a deceased person ; or

(c) any person who has applied or is entitled to apply to a District Court for the grant orresealing of a probate or letters of administration in respect of the estate of a deceased person.

51. (1) Where the Commissioner-General is of opinion that any person is about to or likely to leave Sri Lanka without paying the amount of duty required to be paid by such person, he may issue a certificate containing particulars of such

( L T V )

amount and the name of such person to a Magistrate, who shall, on receipt thereof, direct the Inspector-General of Police to prevent such person from leaving Sri Lanka without paying the amount or furnishing security to the satisfaction of the Commissioner-General for payment thereof.

(2) At the time of issue of his certificate to the Magistrate the Commissioner-General shall issue to such person a notification thereof by personal service or registered letter sent through the post, or telegraph ; but the non-receipt of any such notification by such person shall not invalidate proceedings under this section.

(3) Production of a certificate signed by the Commissioner-General stating that the amount has been paid or that security has been furnished or that the amount has been paid to a police officer in charge of a police station, shall be sufficient autho­rity for allowing such person to leave Sri Lanka. Any Police officer to whom the amount of any duty has been paid shall forthwith pay such amount to the Commissioner-General.

52. Where the Commissioner-General is of opinion that application of any of the provisions of this Chapter has failed or is likely to fail to secure the payment of the whole or any part of the duty due under this Act from any person, it shall be lawful for him to proceed to recover any sum remaining unpaid by any other means of recovery provided in this Chapter, notwithstanding that an order has been made by a Magistrate under section 49 and carried into effect.

53. The Commissioner-General may, by notice in writing to any person, require that person to furnish, within the period specified in such notice, such infor­mation as the Commissioner-General may require for the purposes of recovery of any duty due from such person or any other person.

CHAPTER XV

If it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner-General by claim duly made in writing within one year of the date of the payment of any stamp duty or penalty, by composition or otherwise, that any person has paid any stamp duty or penalty in excess of the amount properly payable by him, such person shall be entitled to have refunded the amount so paid in excess :

Provided that nothing in this section shall operate to extend or reduce any time limit for appeal or repayment specified in any other section or to validate any objection or appeal which is otherwise invalid or to authorize the revision of any matter which has become final and conclusive.
