The rates of increase in wages of different categories of employees in the government sector were similar to those of the previous years. The significant upward revision fn wages and the equalization of male and female wage rates in the plantation sector in April were the most noteworthy features of wage movements in 1984. Consequent\u00adly, the rise in wages of workers in agriculture was the highest among the trades covered by Wages Boards. Wages of other categories of workers covered by Wages Boards increased only moderately. In the unorganised sector, nominal wage rates of all sub sectors except tea, grew at a lower rate than in the previous year.",

Money wages of workers in agriculture alone rose by 25.9 per cent as compared to 9.7 per cent in the previous year. Workers in industry and commerce and service workers received wage increases of only 3.2 per cent and 1.1 per cent, respectively in 1984.
