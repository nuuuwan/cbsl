For refinance in respect of traditional exports (Category I); the interest rate was increased from 10 per cent to 13 per cent per annum with the commercial banks' maximum on-lending rate being increased from 13 per cent to 16 per cent per annum. In respect of non-traditional exports (Category II), the discount rate was increased from 7 per cent to 10 per cent with the commercial banks' on-lending rate being increased from 9.75 per cent to 12.75 per cent on discount and from 10.8 per cent to 13.8 per cent per annum on face value.

This unsatisfactory progress cannot be attributed solely to the lending banks .for there were many factors which affected these schemes beyond the control of the commercial banks. Financing under District Integrated Rural Development Projects depends on the progress achieved by other executing agencies. Financing for sugar cane cultivation under the Pelwatte project could not commence due to the failure of the company to complete other preliminary work on schedule. Similarly, there were operational deficiencies in some credit schemes which made disbursement of credit difficult. Lack of demand for draught animals and four- wheel tractors was mainly responsible for the failure of the banks to proceed with the provision of credit for these purposes satisfactorily.",

Difficulty in the sale of four-wheel tractors has been partly overcome by extending the area of operation to cover the entire island. The sale of water pumps and power sprayers has made good progress during the year. In regard to the irrigation component, the Water Resources Board,the executing agency, made some progress in the procurement of necessary equipment. The ADB Mission which was in Sri Lanka in May, 1984 recommended the reallocation of loan components with a view to expediting the completion of the project before 31st December, 1985, the date of expiry of the loan.",
