Loans and Advances

"Effective 26th March, 1984, the Central Bank withdrew the short term general advance facility available to commercial banks against the pledge of Government and Government Guaranteed Securities and increased the pre-shipment export credit refinance facility.

The Central Bank's accommodation to commercial banks under the refinance schemes for exports continued to be in operation during the year. Several changes to the export credit refinance schemes were introduced on 26th March, 1984. Rates of interest on short term advances to commercial banks against the pledge of usance promissory notes for the purpose of refinancing exports from Sri Lanka were increased. For refinance in respect of traditional exports (Category I); the interest rate was increased from 10 per cent to 13 per cent per annum with the commercial banks' maximum on-lending rate being increased from 13 per cent to 16 per cent per annum. In respect of non-traditional exports (Category II), the discount rate was increased from 7 per cent to 10 per cent with the commercial banks' on-lending rate being increased from 9.75 per cent to 12.75 per cent on discount and from 10.8 per cent to 13.8 per cent per annum on face value. When the sales proceeds of the related exports are received in Sri Lanka within the time limits specified by the Controller of Exchange, the Central Bank makes a refund of 4 percentage points per annum on the relevant refinance loan to the commercial banks to be passed on to the customers.

As stated earlier, the quantum of refinance available for traditional exports was increased by the addition of funds previously given under the general advance facility. Furthermore, the Central Bank was prepared to grant additional refinance outside the limits allocated to each commercial bank for pre-shipment packing credit of tea exports. No limits were placed on refinance under Category II. Exports which qualified for refinance under Category II were defined as all exports other than tea, rubber, coconut, garments, gems, marine products and petroleum products. The period of refinance was limited to 60 days with extensions of 30 days on a case by case basis upto a maximum of 90 days, for both categories of exports.

All exports for which refinance had been obtained required forward purchases cover. This requirement was waived on 9th April, 1984 for exports on firm orders or letters of credit, the value of which was Rs.500,000or less. The duration of the forward contract was related to the maturity of the corresponding letters of credit or the latest period of delivery specified in the export contract, but in no event should it exceed a period of 6 months. Commercial banks had to ensure that foreign currency purchased forward was sold forward only for essential imports. The Central Bank has disbursed an amount of Rs. 8,078.3 million as loans under Category I and an amount of Rs. 2,241.9 million under Category II during 1984.

The rate of interest on Central Bank advances to commercial banks against the pledge of usance promissory notes of co-operative societies or of individuals relating to the production of paddy, vegetables and other specified food crops continued to be at 1.5 per cent per annum. An amount of Rs. 219.7 million was disbursed under this

( v )

scheme during 1984. The rate of interest on the Bank's advances to commercial banks against the pledge of usance promissory notes in respect of advances granted to co-operative societies, agrarian service centres and to authorised persons to finance the purchase of paddy and for the purchase and storage of certain other specified crops grown locally remained unchanged at 3 per cent per annum except on refinance granted to the People's Bank/Paddy Marketing Board., The rate of interest was revised upwards by 2 percentage points for refinance above Rs. 400 million. An amount of Rs. 1,874.5 million was disbursed under this scheme during the year.

Medium and Long Term Credit

During.the year 1984, the Central Bank continued to operate the scheme of. refinance under the Medium and Long Term. Credit Fund. The total refinance disbursed by the Bank during 1984 amounted to Rs. 169.0 million and the total repay­ment received amounted to Rs. 142.6 million. The balance.in the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund stood at Rs. 775.0 million of which Rs. 649.9 million was disbursed and outstanding from credit institutions.

Commercial Bank Credit

With effect from 26th March, 1984 the Central Bank required all commercial banks to ensure that the total amount of their advances granted for the importation of non-essential items should not exceed the advances granted and outstanding as on 23rd March, 1984. The Central Bank also required the commercial banks not to extend credit to single importers beyond the level outstanding as on 23rd March, 1984 in respect of non-essential imports. In addition to these restrictions, com­mercial banks were required to ensure that the total advances granted and outstanding to the private sector other than for exports and agriculture should not exceed more, than 5 per cent of the total amount of such advances granted and outstanding on 1 ltK May, 1984. '

Reserve Requirements

With effect from 23rd November, 1984 the Central Bank introduced a special reserve requirement in addition to the existing reserve requirements imposed on commercial banks. Special reserves were required to be maintained in the form of rupee deposits in the Central Bank. Such reserves were determined in respect of demand deposit liabilities and in respect of time and savings deposit liabilities on the basis of the amount of increase over the level of deposits as at 14th November, 1984. The amount to be maintained as special reserves was determined on the basis of tranches of the increase. The tranches of increase and the amount to be maintained as reserves in respect of each tranche are given below : -

Tranche Amount of Special Reserve

Nil : :. 5%.of increase 10% of increase 15% of increase

(i) Up to 3% (ii) Over 3% and upto 6% (iii) Over 6 % and upto 10 % (iv) Over 10%

( VI )

Treasury Bills

The Central Bank continued transactions in Treasury bills in the secondary market. Sales of Treasury bills increased sharply fromRs. 18,946.9 million in 1983 to Rs. 39,835.6 million in 1984 ; purchases too increased from Rs. 12,668.8 million in 1983 to Rs. 25,677.4 million in 1984. The significant increase in the operations under this scheme was mainly due to the narrowing yield differential between call money market rates and the secondary Treasury bill market rates.

Subsidy and Ex-gratia Payment to Indian Repatriates

The Bank continued to operate, on behalf of the Government, two schemes to expedite the repatriation of estate workers of Indian origin covered under the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of 1964. These were—

(a) the subsidy scheme in terms of which a sum equivalent to 65 per cent of the authorised remittance or part thereof is paid to such repatriates ; and

(b) the scheme under which an ex-gratia payment of Rs. 500 plus 65 per cent thereof per repatriate is paid as an incentive for these workers to leave Sri Lanka.

The Bank operated these two schemes through the commercial banks. Under the subsidy scheme, a sum of Rs. 11.6 million was paid to repatriates during 1984. The total amount of ex-gratia payments made in respect of 5,937 repatriates, who left the Island during the year, amounted to Rs. 4.9 million.

Compulsory Savings Fund

The Central Bank continued to be the custodian of the money collected in terms of the Compulsory Savings Act No. 6 of 1971 and the Ceiling on Income and Compul­sory Savings Law No. 15 of 1972 and administered the Compulsory Savings Fund on behalf of the Government. During the year, the Bank paid out to contributors Rs. 5.9 million (inclusive of interest) on 1,273 refund applications received.

Government Accounts

As banker to the Government, the Government Accounts Branch of the Banking Department continued to maintain accounts of Government Departments, Government Agencies and Institutions and certain statutory bodies. The number of operative accounts in the Government Accounts Branch as at end of December, 1984 was 157 (Government Departments 142 and others 15).

CURRENCY ISSUE

The total currency in circulation as at 31st December, 1984 was Rs. 9,600.0 million. This represents an increase of Rs. 1,426.5 million over the figure of Rs. 8,173.5 million at the end of the preceding year. Currency notes in circulation during the year 1984 increased by Rs. 1,359.4 million and the coin circulation increased by Rs. 67.1 million over the preceding year.

( Vil )

The year under review marked a change in the pattern of demand for high value currency notes, in that, a drop of 23.5 per cent was recorded in the total demand for such notes in 1984 over that of 1983. The demand for high value currency notes of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 which recorded a substantial increase in the previous year showed a reversal in the pattern of demand and a drop of Rs. 241 million and Rs. 109 million, respectively, was observed.

As regards coins, an ever growing demand was observed in respect of the high denominational coins in the year under review. Consequently, special orders were placed in 1984 for substantial quantities of the higher denomination coins, namely, Re 1, -/50 cts. and -/25 cts. Action has been finalised to replace the Rs. 2 and Rsi 5 currency notes with coins. The new design coins to be issued in early 1985 will circulate along with the notes, until the latter are gradually withdrawn from circulation.

BANKING DEVELOPMENT

As at end of 1984, there were 25 commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka, comprising four domestic banks and 21 foreign banks. There were also two Represenr tative Offices of foreign banks and two merchant banking companies carrying on business in the country. During the year, 13 branches and one pay office were opened by. Sri Lankan banks. The Bank of Credit & Commerce International Limited opened a branch in the Investment Promotion Zone, Katunayake on 5th May, 1984.

Accordingly, at end 1984 the total number of bank branches stood at 1,022 of which the operating branches inclusive of 59 Agrarian Service Centre (ASQ branches amounted to 647. The balance included relocated ASC branches, pay offices, Kachcheri branches and extension offices. Meanwhile, the American Express International Banking Corporation was granted approval for the establishment of its Regional Office for Asia in Colombo and this commenced business in May, 1984.

BANK SUPERVISION

The Bank commenced examination of ten commercial banks for the examination period 1984/1985 under Section 29(1) of the Monetary Law Act and concluded four of these examinations. In addition, operations of commercial banks were supervised continuously on the basis of monthly, quarterly, and annual statements furnished by them. The Bank also commenced the examination of a banking institution, other than a commercial bank under Section 29(2) of the Monetary Law Act.

The supervision and examination of finance companies, registered with the Monetary Board under the provisions of the Control of Finance Companies: Act No. 27 of 1979 continued in 1984. Examinations of eighteen finance com­panies under Section 15(1) of the Act commenced during the year 1984 and twelve of these examinations were concluded. The examination of two finance companies which commenced in 1983 was also concluded during the year. Applications for

( VIII )

registration under the Act received from finance companies were evaluated and four companies were registered with the Monetary Board during the year. Monthly statements furnished, by finance companies and their annual profit and loss accounts and balance sheets were analysed, with particular attention paid to liquidity and capital ratios and transfers to reserve funds.

The Bank also continued its programme of monitoring the transactions of the Foreign Currency Banking Units established by commercial banks under the Foreign Currency Banking Scheme.

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE

Approval of Central Bank refinance for Medium and Long Term Investment in 1984 remained at the moderate level of Rs. 129.6 million. However, it reflected a substantial increase over the approvals of only Rs. 74.8 million in the previous year. Refinance in respect of the export sector increased from Rs. 37 million in 1983 to Rs.79.1 million in 1984 while refinance for industry increased from Rs. 7 million to Rs., 49.1 million. Terms and conditions of refinance remained unchanged in 1984 but tourism and construction of commercial buildings were not refinanced in this year.

The fall in the tourist arrivals precipitated a major liquidity crisis in the hotel sector calling for some relief measures in the course of 1984. Consequently, at the instance of Government and after a series of consultations with banking institutions, the Central Bank announced a package of relief measures to hotels in September, 1984. These reliefs included a moratorium for the repayment of principal and interest on loans, extending to March, 1987, and re-scheduling of out­standing debts over an extended period. Central Bank offered to refinance 60 per cent of the interest in arrears, in order to give liquidity relief to affected banks. The progress in.the re-scheduling exercise was slow but by December 1984, nearly 40 hotel projects were under consideration for re-scheduling.

The second Small and Medium Scale Industry Loan Scheme (SMI-II) registered some progress in 1984, but the commitment of funds nevertheless remained low. After a series of review meetings with the World Bank, the Government and the Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs), the spread available to the PCIs for SMI loans was increased from 5 per cent to 7 per cent in September, 1984. Also additional sectors such as bee keeping, horticulture, commercial transport of goods, commercial scale animal husbandry, colour photo processing outside Colombo and the financing of permanent working capital were made eligible for SMI loans. Since nearly 40 per cent of the outstanding SMI loans had fallen into arrears with respect to recoveries by December 1983, the Central Bank intensified its follow-up work with direct project inspections (243 inspections in 1984 in almost all parts of the Island). The follow-up work was mainly directed to identifying problems and making appropriate recommendations for their rehabilitation and eventual recovery. The direct participation of the Central Bank in project follow-up appears to have helped to bring about re-scheduling of loans and make available additional facilities for

( i x )

rehabilitation of sick projects. Also, a large number of defaulters appears to have recommenced repayments after Central Bank inspections. Consequently, the number of loans in arrears of more than 3 instalments guaranteed under the Central Bank Guarantee Schemes decreased from 966 in December 1983 to 850 in December 1984.

Operations of the Medium and Long-term Credit Fund (MLCF)

Under Categories II, III and IV of tjie Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund (MLCF),45 applications amounting to Rs. 129.6 million were approved of which 25 applications amounting to Rs. 79.1 million were for export oriented projects under Category II of the scheme. There were 17 applications amounting to Rs. 49.1 million for industrial projects during the year. A breakdown of refinance approvals is shown in Table 2.2. Category I of the MLCF is. administered by the Department of Rural Credit. Terms and conditions of refinance reported in the Annual Report 1983 remained unchanged.

Small and Medium Scale Industry Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMI-H)

The second SMI (SMI-II) commenced in 1982 with an International Develop­ment Association line of credit of U.S. $. 30 million. The utilization of SMI funds in the course of 1983 and 1984 was poor and the total commitment of funds (being 80 per cent of loans refinanced by the NDB) by December 1984 was only

Rs. 133.3 million.

RURAL CREDIT

During the year 1984, the Central Bank continued to play an active role in directing and supporting the rural credit operations of the banking system. The Bank was actively involved in the formulation of policies relating to rural credit.

During the year the most important activity in which the Bank was involved was the preparation of legislation concerning the proposal to establish Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) in the country and matters connected with its implementation. The draft proposals were ready by the middle of the year and received Cabinet approval. It is expected that the proposals will come before Parliament for approval in early 1985. In view of this the Bank initiated the preliminary work for implementing this proposal.

At the same time, a Committee examined and reported on recruitment policies, salaries and other emoluments, location of RRDBs and innovative approaches to rural lending to be adopted by these banks.

In 1984, the Rural Credit Advisory Board (RCAB) met on seven occasions. This is the principal policy formulating body in the area of rural credit. At these meetings several issues with far reaching implications for the rural sector were taken up for discussion. More over, several proposals for the introduction of credit schemesto

Under SMI-II Central Bank had issued 372 credit guarantees covering Rs. 141.0 million loans granted by participating credit institutions. Among the loans guaranteed, 58 loans had already fallen into arrears. Banks had submitted 3 claims and they were pending settlement in December, 1984. An industry-wise classification of loans granted under SMI-II is shown in Table 2.5.

... TABLE 2 . 5

SMI-II Scheme - Industry - wise Classification of Loans

( XIII )

cater to the requirements, hitherto not covered under existing schemes, were also considered. Proposals for rescheduling of loans given under the Fisheries Sector Bank Financing Scheme, the introduction of the Revolving Credit Scheme for paddy farmers in the Polonnaruwa district, refinancing facilities for farm machinery and equipment in the wet zone areas, and the extension of agricultural credit through Thrift and Co-operative Credit Societies were some of the principal proposals that were examined by the RCAB. Some proposals have been implemented already, while some others are to be implemented in the near future.

Table 2.6 shows the progress of existing credit schemes under Category I of the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund of the Central Bank. There were 27 such schemes in operation during the year 1984, of which five were introduced during the year.

As in the previous year, there was a considerable number of schemes which showed inadequate progress in the disbursement of loans. The Central Bank had allocated Rs. 882.2 million for provision of refinance facilities for these schemes, of which only Rs. 313.3 million or 36 per cent had been utilised as at the end of the year. This unsatisfactory progress cannot be attributed solely to the lending banks .for there were many factors which affected these schemes beyond the control of the commercial banks. Financing under District Integrated Rural Development Projects depends on the progress achieved by other executing agencies. Financing for sugar cane cultivation under the Pelwatte project could not commence due to the failure of the company to complete other preliminary work on schedule. Similarly, there were operational deficiencies in some credit schemes which made disbursement of credit difficult. Lack of demand for draught animals and four- wheel tractors was mainly responsible for the failure of the banks to proceed with the provision of credit for these purposes satisfactorily.

On the other hand, the progress in some loan schemes such as credit for two-wheel tractors, where there is a ready demand, has been satisfactory during the year under review. Lack of necessary infrastructure, skilled man power and motivation of officers of commercial banks remained important factors responsible for the slow progress in many credit schemes in 1984.

The Sri Lanka Rural Credit Project, assisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in which the Central Bank is the co-ordinating agency, made satisfactory progress in lending. In regard to the farm power component of the project, after achieving the targetted sale of 1,000 two-wheel tractors to farmers, the two executing agencies, viz : the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank entered into a second agreement with the Sri Lanka State Trading (Tractor) Corporation in 1984, for the further procurement of 1,000 two-wheel tractors. Difficulty in the sale of four-wheel tractors has been partly overcome by extending the area of operation to cover the entire island. The sale of water pumps and power sprayers has made good progress during the year. In regard to the irrigation component, the Water Resources Board,the executing agency, made some progress in the procurement of necessary equipment. The ADB Mission which was in Sri Lanka in May, 1984 recommended the reallocation of loan components with a view to expediting the completion of the project before 31st December, 1985, the date of expiry of the loan.

During the year 1984, the Central Bank completed the inspection of the agricultural loan portfolios of 18 commercial bank branches (8 branches of the People's Bank and 10 branches of the Bank of Ceylon) and the working, of three CpTOperative Rural Banks in the districts of Ampara, Puttalam, Matale, Nuwara-Eliya, Badulla, Kandy and Kalutara. Inspection reports were sent to the re'spective branches, along with suitable recommendations for rectifying the deficiencies and with a request for a compliance report to the Central Bank.

RURAL BANKING AND STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

The Rural Banking and Staff Training College organized and conducted twenty six training courses, seminars and workshops where 636 middle and senior level management personnel from commercial banks, other financial institutions and co-operative societies participated. The programme on ' Credit Management' was co-sponsored by the Grindlays Bank, Colombo, and was conducted by the faculty of the Grindlays International Training Institute, Bombay, India while the course on 'Developing Management Skills' was conducted in association with the Citibank, Colombo.

The training offered by the College in 1984 was in areas relating to credit manage­ment, project identification and evaluation, commercial banking, management development, computerisation of banking, cottage industries, statistics and accountancy. Training of officers in rural banking and credit was considered a priority. Programmes were also conducted in the outstations.

The College completed its third year of operations in September, 1984. The third anniversary lecture of the College was delivered by Mr. N. G. P. Panditharatna, Member, Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Ceylon on the topic, ' Credit in the Mahaweli Areas'.

EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND

The Monetary Board of the Central Bank is entrusted with the responsibility of receiving contributions, surcharges and the investment of funds of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), maintaining proper accounts of registered employers and the individual members of the EPF and effecting refund of benefits to the members in terms of provisions of the E.P.F. Act. These activities are carried out by the Emplo­yees' Provident Fund Department of the Bank in close co-operation with the Employees' Providept Fund Division of the Labour Department which attends to the administration and the enforcement of the provisions of the Act. A brief note on its operations during the year 1984 is given below.

Contributions

The contributions received by the Fund during the year 1984, amounted to Rs. 1;583.4 million as'againsf Rs. 1,201.7 million in 1983. This represents an increase of Rs. 381.7 million or 31.8 per cent over the level of contributions received during the previous year. This is the highest percentage increase recorded since 1978.

( xvn )

Members, Balances

Members' balances as at 31st December 1984, before allocation of interest' for the year under review, stood at Rs. 10,392.8 million which is an increase of Rs. 2,050.9 million or 24.6 per cent over the level of 1983.

Investments

During the year under review, the Fund invested a sum of Rs. 5,895.6 milhon in Government Securities, Treasury bills and Debentures issued by the Urban Deve­lopment Authority and the State Mortgage and Investment Bank, as against a sum of Rs. 2,389.0 million in 1983. This is an increase of Rs. 3,506.6 million over the level of 1983. The total investments made during the year under review included a sum of Rs. 3,717.7 million, representing maturity proceeds of earlier investments and Treasury bills. The total amount invested in Government Securities alone amounted to Rs. 3,152.3 million which represented 72.6 per cent of the tbtal securities issued by the Government of Sri Lanka during the year 1984. The total amount'invested in Treasury bills at various intervals during the year amounted to Rs. 2,472,9 ihilhon. At the end of the year under review, the Fund did not hold any Treasury bUls, as they were discounted earlier. The total investments held by the Fund as at 31st December, 1984 amounted to Rs. 11,134.7 million, which is an increase of Rs. 2,17&0 million over the level of 1983.

Income Received from Investments

In 1984, the income from investments of the Fund amounted to Rs. I,193\9 million as against Rs. 923.4 million in 1983, recording an increase of Rs. 270.5 million or 29.3 per cent. This increase was mainly due to the investment of the' increased volume of contributions received by the Fund and the re-investmeht of income derived from the past investments during the year under review.

Refunds

The total sum paid out by way of refund of EPF benefits to members during the year 1984, amounted to Rs. 551.6 million as against a sum of Rs. 383.6-million in 1983. This records an increase of Rs. 168.0 million or 43.8 per cent. During the year under review 75,281 claims for refund of benefits were received in the Department which included 8,314 from repatriates of Indian origin and 40,278 on medical grounds. The number of claims paid out during the year totalled to 65,198.

Interest on Members'Balances

The Employees' Provident Fund is required to pay interest on members' balances as at end of each year out of the income from investment of monies of the Fund. The rate of interest payable on members' balances as at end of 1983 was raised to 12 per cent per annum in 1984. Interest is paid on the balances standing to the credit of members at the end of the year and thereafter interest accumulates on the aggregate sum. Besides, interest is paid for the entire year on the balance standing to the members' credit at the end of the year, irrespective of the date when any portion of that balance (which represents the current year's contributions) was

( XVIII )

received by the Fund to the member's credit, e.g. contributions received in December attracts interest for the full year in the same way as contributions received in January of that year. Therefore, the effective rate of interest is, approximately 13.4 per cent.

A comparative statement of the operation of the Fund on data presently avai­lable is given below:

EXCHANGE CONTROL

The Bank continued to function as the agent of the Government with regard to implementation of exchange control. The major changes in Exchange Control Procedure that came into effect during the year under review are as follows:

1. Shipping and Airline External Accounts

The approval of the Controller of Exchange was declared necessary for the opening of Shipping and Airline External Accounts with effect from 1st June, 1984.

2. Exports

(i) The requirement that payment for goods exported should be received not later than six months from the date of export was amended as follows with effect from 9th April, 1984.

(b) Letters of Credit (deferred payment)—not later than 21 days from the date of maturity.

(c) D/P Bills (Sight Bills without L/C)—not later than 21 days from the date of presentation of documents.

( XIX )

(d) Usance Bills (D/A}—not later than 180 days from the date of shipment. Any extension of the above limits required the prior approval of the Controller of Exchange.

(ii) Authorised Dealers were required to purchase forward foreign exchange proceeds of exports exceeding Rs. 500,000 in value with effect from 2nd May, 1984.

(iii) The requirement of an export licence from the Controller of Imports and Exports for the export of cinnamon to countries other than Mexico was waived with effect from 6th June, 1984.

( x x )

5. Non-Resident Rupee Accounts

Authorised Dealers were informed that applications from Foreign Exchange Houses for the opening of Non-Resident Accounts should be backed by a guarantee of rupees one million by a reputed bank abroad. Exchange Control approval was also considered necessary for the designation of Non-Resident Accounts as Non-Resident Blocked Accounts.

PUBLIC DEBT

The Central Bank continued to manage Public Debt on behalf of the Government in terms of Section 113 of the Monetary Law Act. The main functions under this inclu­ded floating of rupee loans, issue of Treasury bills and Tax Reserve Certificates, recording of foreign loan disbursements, servicing of local and foreign loans and payment of interest and commitment charges. During the year 1984 rupee loans amounting to Rs. 4,344.3 million were floated in terms of the Appropriation Act No. 52 of 1983. The issue of Treasury bills during the year resulted in a decrease of Rs, 2,540 million from the level that prevailed at the end of 1983. During the year the Superintendent of Public Debt continued to manage the Joint Investment Fund. However, Govern­ment contributions for redemption of rupee loans were discontinued from January, 1984. Total interest payments on Public Debt in 1984 amounted to Rs. 7,296.4 million and total repayments of loans amounted to Rs. 4,632 million inclusive of repayments out of the resources of sinking funds. In addition, the Superintendent 'of Public Debt floated and serviced debentures on behalf of the Urban Development Authority and the State Mortgage and Investment Bank and also issued Central Bank Securities details of which are given elsewhere in this section.

REGIONAL OFFICE — MATARA

The year 1984 commenced with the shifting of the Regional Office to its own premises at No. 35, Anagarika Dharmapala Mawatha, Matara. During the year, the Regional Office continued to provide services for a wider section of persons engaged in small scale economic activities by way of facilitating bank lending and back-up services. The main emphasis was on implementing Self-Employment, Village Adoption and Paddy Cultivation Refinance Loan Schemes.

A series of project orientation training sessions were conducted for applicants seeking bank loans under various refinance schemes during 1984. Apart from trai­ning 446 participants in agriculture, livestock farming and small industry a larger-number of discussions and meetings were held in Matara, Hambantota and Monera-gala Districts for the benefit of paddy and highland farmers.

The Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Depart­ment of Animal Production and Health and the Agriculture Development Authority lent their assistance in conducting training programmes.

The following is a statistical summary of the refinance credit operations with which this office associated as at end of 1984.

It can be seen from the above statistical summary, that the aggregate: sum of credit facilities mobilized under refinance schemes through the banking, system in the region amounted to Rs. 8,909,065 catering to aboutr2,000 beneficiaries ajs at end of 1984. : - ' e ^

Agrp-loans under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (CRCS) were virtually" defunct when the Regional Office introduced the Model Yaya Paddy CultivatiorF Loan Scheme in 1982. Defaults were high and as a result both the bankersaad the*, farmers were disillusioned with the CRCS. A dialogue was re-established through a series of meetings for the benefit of the farmers and officials at village level;. The initiative taken by the Indian Overseas Bank in providing cultivation loans in several villages, encouraged the state banks . to take part in the newly . designed Model 'Yaya' Paddy Loan Scheme under the CRCS. The Bank of Ceylon lent its support for the scheme; and as at end of 1984 they successfully recovered the loans granted.for paddy cultivation amounting "to -Jrupees one ^.million in two seasons. The Bank of Ceylon and the Indian Overseas Bank how; provide about Rs. 2.2 million of agro-loans under this scheme. This is expected tq move -up gradually over the years "when new paddy tracts are brought under the credit scheme. ' . : ' ' ' ' ' ' ~ ''"""'"

In an attempt to promote bank lending to agriculture in the dry zone areas'of Hambantota and Moneragala, a series of seminars were conducted over the past two years to expose the farmers to modern systems of farm management and: lending operations. Though there were obstacles initially due to lack of infra-structural facilities and problems connected with the attitudes of farmers and bankers, a major break-through was made im 1984 by way of credit deployment, owing to the assistance received from various government and nongovernmental organisations in the, region. As a result, several farmer groups were able to obtain loans amounting to about Rs. 800,000 for the cultivation of paddy, vegetables and subsidiary food crops for lift irrigation systems and for the purchase of two wheel tractors.

The Central Bank Refinance Credit Schemes to promote fertilizer use in the plantation sector were a boon to the small holders in the region, though several constraints such as tenurial problems, licensing and registration procedures, coupled with formalities in bank lending hampered the fuller utilisation of resources allo­cated under these schemes. However, the funds disbursed by banks under the Tea Fertilizer Refinance Loan Scheme amounted to Rs, 1,088,924 (in respect of Galle and Matara Districts) while in the case of coconut fertilizer (in Matara and Hambantota Districts) they amounted to Rs. 766,010.

A significant feature of these refinance credit operations has been the relatively high rate of loan recovery owing to close supervision of individual projects and credit programmes. The overall rate of recovery in respect of all refinance credit opera­tions has been estimated at 85 per cent.

( XXIV )

Table 2.9 shows the combined loan recovery position with respect to Self-Employment and Village Adoption Schemes which recorded about 83 per cent recovery of loans. Loans under other schemes, such as paddy and dry-farming, not shown in tables separately, have recorded almost over 90 per cent loan recoveries in each category;

The Matara Regional Office lent its support to government and non-government agencies and institutions in promoting development banking in the region. This office took part in 30. .seminars conducted .by.various organisations, arranged an equal number of village level discussions with farmers and other beneficiaries and conducted farm management and leadership training workshops at village.level.

•A unit has been formed'to co-ordinate the island-wide data collection.activities of the Central Bank by undertaking the supervision of the work of data collectors at 13 centres ranging from Galle to Bibile. A unit to assist in the follow up of projects financed under the Small and Medium Scale Industries . Loan Scheme functioned during the year. A total of 35 industrial units in Matara; and Hambantota districts cojne under the purview of this office.

The Matara Regional Clearing House cleared a total of 135,984 cheques, to the value of Rs. 868 million during 1984.

REGIONAL OFFICE —ANURADHAPURA

The Anuradhapura Regional Office continued to pursue the goal of fostering economic growth, particularly of low income groups in the region through bank credit during 1984, the third year of its operation. The implementation of the Special Development Lending Scheme (SDLS) launched during the inaugural year received the highest priority in order to ensure meaningful and effective participation of commercial banks in this scheme.

Despite excessive rains and floods in the first quarter of the year which affected cultivation in the area and necessitated programmes for rehabilitation and re­scheduling of some of the loans, and the deterioration in the security, situation which resulted in curtailment of banking activities in the northern region, the overall per­formance of the lending programme was satisfactory. Bankers continued to finance mote projects identified by the Regional Office with a clear vision of the Central Bank's objectives and the projects in operation recorded encouraging results in the sphere of income, employment generation and loan repayments.

A total number of 954 projects were identified under the SDLS and 237 projects were in operation. The Regional Office has so far been able to reach more than 100 selected villages in the Anuradhapura district and enlighten approximately 25,000 to 3fJ,000 persons on the opportunities available to them through banks, and the advantages of cultivating sound banking habits. The impact of the campaign which is conducted on an on-going basis is clearly evident from the increase in the number of persons seeking assistance from the scheme.

( XXV )

The Regional Office has also strengthened its links with other institutions and agencies such.as the Departments of- Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and Health, the district administration and grassroot level officials with a view to ensuring a steady progress of the SDLS. In order to enhance the operational efficiency of the scheme, art attempt was riiade to identify borrowers in selected compact areas; Several operational policy revisions too were effected in an effort to respond more effectively to the changing heeds. The scale of finances for small scale industrial and livestock projects has been increased to Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 10,000 respectively. Coverage has been widened with the inclusion of two-wheel tractors, agricultural implements and finances for land preparation.

During the year, 317 projects were identified, of which 103 projects were approved by banks. These included agriculture and livestock projects which accounted for 75 per cent of the identified projects. In agriculture the use of dug wells for irrigation was encouraged. During the year a total of Rs. 1.8 million was committed by banks for project financing and Rs. 1.4 .million was disbursed.

Taking into consideration the loss of employment opportunities as a result of flood affected projects, it is estimated that 204 have stabilised, in their employ­ment, while 89 persons; have found new employment opportunities from the projects in operation. In: regard to employment creation, small scale industrial projects have shown a higher potential than the agricultural projects though the comparative income generating capacity of the agricultural projects is somewhat higher. The aggregate gross income generated by projects in operation is estimated to be Rs. 7 million during the year under review. Timely provision of advice, guidance and credit and training in intensive cultivation techniques to the borro­wers were the main contributory factors for the success of most of the agricultural projects. .

'As at end December, 1984, 199 projects were due for repayment of loans. A total of 14 borrowers repaid their loans in full. A drop in the rate of repay­ment1 in 1984 is observed'as compared with the rate of 86 per*- cent in 1983. However, the rate of repayment still remains around 70 per cent. Destruction caused to some of the projects during early part of the year resulted in the decline of repayment and a few cases of wilful defaults tod have been observed. Rehabilitation programmes and re-scheduling of loans of the damaged projects have been arranged and legal action has been contemplated against the wilful defaulters;••. . •;

?•• A programme of integrated development of villages was effectively carried out at Galahitiyagariia in theHdrowpothana AGA Division covering afi?as of agricultural development, health and education. The villagers were encouraged .to adopt advan­ced technology in their cultivation methods, with the help of special training programmes, field visits and demonstrations. This exercise has proved to be satisfa­ctory with the villagers reaping an extremely successful harvest despite flood damage. Aspects of education and* health improvement particularly amongst children were also taken care of. The overall impact of the programme is clearly demonstrable as five more adjacent villages have sought bank assistance.

In 1984, the Regional Office conducted 16 training programmes, covering crop cultivation and livestock development. While lectures provided the theoretical background for intensive cultivation, field visits and the demonstrations provided the participants with a practical knowledge of land preparation, the economic use of "well water, safe handling of water pumps, preparation of nurseries and the use of fertilizer and pesticides etc. Approximately, 1,600 persons have so far benefited •from these programmes and expertise from the Departments of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Health was utilized in conducting training. Training programmes conducted by other agencies Such as theMinistry of Youth Affairs and Employment and the Industrial Development Board were also used by the Regional Office t o -provide a detailed knowledge of project management and accounting procedures to the village investors.

The Regional Office endeavoured to promote an efficient credit delivery system, strengthen the implementation and institutional capacity and ensure regular contact and exchange of views between the Regional Office and others engaged in development work. For this purpose, several seminars, workshops and discussions for bank officials, managers of the Agricultural Development Authority, Chairmen of Gramodaya Mandala, other grassroot level officials were conducted during the year under review.

The Regional Office continued to assist and supervise the Islandwide Data Collection Programme of the Central Bank. Inspection of projects under the SMI Scheme was extended to cover a larger number of projects. During the year under review 25 such projects were examined. Data oh 'tiny sector' industrial projects were continuously collected. A report on the progress and performance of 'tiny sector' industrial projects is being prepared.

A survey was conducted to review the performance of the " Health Month" conducted during the month of September 1984 by the health inspectors of the district, co-ordinated by the district administration. A report based on the findings was submitted to the District Authorities.

The Regional Office Clearing House cleared cheques to the value of Rs. 148.5 million.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

Ther^ Committee oh Customer Services in Banking which comprises senior officials of the- Central Bank, commercial banks and certain development oriented ministries and government institutions was established in mid^Sl. It has been functioning with the main objective of improving commercial banks' services to customers. During the year 1984 the Committee caused an Index of Circulars/Operating Instructions issued by the Exchange Control and Banking Departments of the Central Bank during the period 1977-1983 to be compiled. This was done mainly with a view, to assisting the new banks that set up operations in Sri Lainka in recent times. The Committee also finalised arrangements to conduct a Survey on Customer Services in Banking and questionnaires are expected to be despatched to a random sample of 10,000 customers in early 1985.

( XXIX )

PUBLICATIONS

The Annual Report of the Central Bank for the year 1983 was presented to the Honourable Minister of Finance and Planning in terms of Section 35 of the Monetary Law Act. The Review of the Economy, 1983 was also published later in the year, while the monthly bulletin was published regularly. A brief review of the economy in the first half of 1984 was published during the year, under the title " Economic Performance in the first half of 1984 ".

During the year, Part I of the Report of the Consumer Finance and Socio-Economic Survey 1981/1982 and Part II of the Report of the Consumer Finance and Socio-Economic Survey 1978/1979 containing detailed statistical tables, were published. Price and Wage Statistics—1983, containing data collected under the country wide data collecting system was released during the year. The Socio-Economic Data Folder for 1984, containing basic data for the year was also issued. A report on Business Activities and Private Investment covering the period 1982/1983 to 1985/1986 was also published.

The ' Credit Bulletin' No. 4, containing information on agricultural, credit and the Sinhala version of the " Guide to Banking in Sri Lanka" were published in 1983. The latter publication was reprinted to meet the heavy demand.

Occasional paper No.7 on 'Tea Production in Sri Lanka-Future Outlook and Mechanisms for Enhancing Sectoral Performance' by Dr. R. Dias Bandaranaike, and No. 8 on ' Rural Savings Mobilization' by Dr. Nimal Sanderatna were also published.

The News Survey and the Sinhala version * Satahana' continued to be published and both publications appeared to be popular with the reading public judging from the increase in its demand.

The Central Bank continued to compile all data pertaining to agriculture, rural development and credit and this data were released in the-form of a half yearly bulletin in 1984. The Bank continued to publish the quarterly magazine of * Geminaya Thorathuru' which was started in 1983 and the bulletin on Retail Prices of Agricultural Inputs.

SEMINARS

In August 1984 the Bank organized the Senior Executive Study /Tour Programme of the Asian & Pacific Regional Agricultural Credit Association and German Foundation for International Development (APRACA/DSE) for 21 delegates from countries of the region. The People's Bank and the Bank of Ceylon assisted the Bank in the organization and financing. The Study/Tour consisted of a Conference in Colombo and visits to various projects assisted by the People's Bank, the Bank of Ceylon and the Regional Offices of the Central Bank in various parts of the country over a period of 8 days. .

( XXX )

The Central Bank hosted the Eighth Seacen Training Course on "Inspection and Supervision of Financial Institutions " organised by the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training Centre from July 23—August 24, 1984. The course designed for officers in central banks and monetary authorities who are directly involved in the regulation of commercial banks and other financial institu­tions included participants from the Bank Indonesia, the Bank Negara Malaysia, the Nepal Rastra Bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Bank of Thailand and the Central Bank of Ceylon.

SURVEYS

Analytical work on a study undertaken in association with the World Bank on " The Evolution of Living Standards and Policy in Sri Lanka since 1970 " was in progress during the year under review. The study is aimed at analysing trends in living standards of Sri Lanka over the past decade in the context of the policy initiatives by the Government.

In February, the Bank conducted a follow-up study on the report of the Task Force, which surveyed the damage to commercial and industrial establishments, to assess the progress of the rehabilitation and reconstruction of industries and other commercial establishments, which were affected by the July, 1983 disturbances.

An evaluation study of one of the credit schemes under the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund, i.e. Loan Scheme for Purchase of Two-wheel Tractors under the Matale District Integrated Rural Development Project was also conducted.

The Bank continued to monitor the import liberalization programme by obtaining monthly data on Letters of Credit opened for imports.

TRAINING

During the year, the Central Bank continued its programme of academic and practical training for Bank officers. Academic courses were confined to post-graduate studies mainly in economics and statistics. Practical training in the form of short-term courses, seminars, study tours etc., covered the areas related to Rural Development, Agricultural and Industrial Credit, Banking, Economics and Computer Studies. Training was undertaken both locally and abroad.

Several training courses were conducted at the Bank's Rural Banking & Staff Training College and, therefore, the need to send Central Bank officers for training at other local training centres was very much reduced. A total of 90 officers followed training courses at the Training College. Some of the other institutions where officers participated in training courses and seminars were the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration, the National Institute of Business Management, the Institute of Business Management etc.

The in-service training programme for Central Bank officers at the Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank continued during this period. A total of 33 officers both in the Staff and Non-staff grades underwent this training during 1984.
