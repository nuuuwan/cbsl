The programme in the Badulla district commenced in mid-1982 and the estimated cost of the project was Rs. 406 rmllion. The finance for this project is derived from two sources. The productive sectors of the programme are funded by a loan from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) while the social overhead component which involves development of health and educational facilities in the district is funded by a grant from the SIDA. This project emphasized the development of tea smallholdings, rural roads and rural water supply in the 1984 implementation programme. The cumulative expenditure on the project by the end of 1984 amounted to Rs. 99 million of which Rs. 51 million was incurred in 1984.

The implementation of the Mannar and Vavuniya IRD Programmes commenced in 1984 with financial assistance from the World Bank to cover a major portion of the project. The total estimated cost of the Mannar programme is Rs. 338 million, and of the Vavuniya programme is Rs. 380 million. The major components of the projects are irrigation and water management, agricultural input supplies, agricul­tural credit, fisheries and livestock development, rural electrification and improve­ment of health and educational facilities. Priority has been given for the develop­ment of irrigation, rural electrification, rural roads, improving health facilities and forestry in the 1984 programme. The expenditure on the Mannar programme in 1984 amounted to Rs. 22 million while that on the Vavuniya programme amounted to Rs. 35 million.

Ratnapura district was also brought under the IRD Programme in 1984 with funding from the Government of the Netherlands, which agreed to provide a grant of Rs. 150 million. In March, 1984 the implementation of the programme commenced in three agro-ecological zones in the district. The project initially aims at creating better living conditions for the target groups in more backward regions of the district. Development of water supply facilities in the rural areas of the district assumes an important place in the project.

The most recent addition to the IRD Programme was the Monaragala district. In this district, the implementation of the programme commenced in mid-1984 with a project period of three years. The estimated total cost of the programme is Rs. 170 million and is funded by the Norwegian Aid for Development (NORAD). In 1984, special attention was given to improve the institutional capability of district planning to facilitate more speedy and efficient implementation of the project during the rest of the project period.
