    "text": "An analysis of sectoral composition of GDP growth in 1984 shows that the increase of 5.1 per cent in teal GDP was largely the combined effect of the improved performance in manufacturing and services. Apart from the declines in coconut and paddy in the agricultural sector there was a more balanced growth in all other sectors compared to 1983 when income generation was mainly confined to agriculture and services. The growth in value added in manufacturing at 12.3'per cent in 1984 was substantially higher than in the previous year. Meanwhile, the services sector which maintained a relatively high rate of growth in the last fewyears grew by 5.8 per cent in 1984. Growth in the agricultural sector slowed down considerably to 2.2 per cent. There was also a small deceleration in construction activity. .",

    "text": "1 The performance of the various sub-sectors in GDP has not shown any consistent growth pattern over the last few years. This has been reflected in the changing sectoral origins of GDP growth. The poor performance of the agricultural sector in 1984 was largely the result of negative |jroWth in the paddy and coconut sub-sectors. Value added in paddy which recorded the highest ever rate of growth in 1983 declined by two per cent due to flood damage to the Maha 1983-84 paddy crop. Coconut production was also affected by-the adverse weather conditions in the previous year resulting itt a severe decline in value added for the second consecutive yeati Rubber showed a marginal growth of 1.5 per cent. The adverse impact of the decline in paddy and coconut was more than offset by the 16 per cent increase in value added in tea. Growth in other agriculture continued to be high. Manufacturing was a leading growth sector in 1984, recording a vastly improved performance. Increased tea production during the year contributed largely to the growth of 10 per cent in value added in tree crop processing. This was a substantial improvement over the negative",

High levels of activity in the import and export trade helped to maintain the growth momentum in services. Growth in the other services sub-sectors continued to be sluggish mainly because of the poor performance of the tourist sub-sector and the cbnsequent decline in the demand for ancillary services. Tourism recovered partially from the setback it experienced in 1983. The relative stagnation of the construction sector was partly due to the completion of headworks of two major projects under the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Programme. The construction of the Victoria Dam and the Hydro Power Tunnel and the Minipe Right Bank Trans Basin Canal was completed during the first half of the year. Private sector construction activity also declined in 1984.",

The poor growth in the agricultural sector was marked by the decline in output of paddy and coconut which was primarily related to adverse weather conditions, the former being affected by flood damage and the latter by the lagged effect of the drought of 1983. The most outstanding development of the agricultural sector Was the recovery in the tea industry. The unusually heavy rains in the first half of the year which severely damaged \u2022 food crop cultivation in the Maha season also helped tea production to recover. Tea production which had continuously declined in the past two years rose by 16 per cent over that of 1983 and approximated the level of production reached in 1981. The increased tea production combined With booming export prices brought much needed relief to producers in both the public and private sectors whose margins had been unfavourable for several years. The better performance of the tea industry was also reflected in the improved per\u00adformance of the government budget and the balance of payments.",

This improvement came entirely from public sector plantations. In contrast to the previous year's favourable record of growth, \"output of private sector rubber growers declined by 3 per cent. As already noted the lagged effect of the drought during most of 1983 depressed growth in the coconut sub-sector. Coconut production declined by 14 per cent with production declining to the lowest level recorded in the recent past.

Output in factory industry recorded a substantial increase of 15 per cent, which was the combined outcome of the improved performance of both private sector (26 per cent) and public sector industry (7 per cent). The resilience shown by the private factory industry was a noteworthy achievement in view of the disturbances experienced in 1983. The increase of output in private sector industry was also reflected in the substantial increase in exports of textile and garments and other industrial goods. The continued better performance of private factory industry is a clear indication of its favourable response to the attractive package of incentives provided by the government. Nevertheless, there is much scope for the private sector to strengthen its performance and become more competitive through improve\u00adments in productivity and management.",

A sharp increase in food prices was recorded in the first half of 1984 due to the poor supply position and revisions in administered prices. High export prices also exerted an upward pressure on domestic prices. However, an encouraging turnaround was observed towards the second half of the year, when there was an appreciable deceleration in the rate of inflation. The year on year (point to point) increase registered in the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI) at end December, 1984 was only 9 per cent compared with 21 per cent in 1983. Similarly, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) registered a year on year (point to point) increase of 5 per cent at the end of 1984. Despite the sharp decline in prices in the second half of the year, high prices in the first half resulted in annual average prices for the year being above",

    "text": "The marked deceleration in prices which helped to achieve single digit price increases (on a point to point basis) as reflected in the CCPI and the WPI by the end of the year was due to several factors; the most important factors being the improved supply situation, particularly in regard to food, the deflationary impact of the govern\u00adment budget, the effectiveness of restrictive monetary policy measures and an increase in savings. A decline in the rate of imported inflation combined with continued stability in the prices of some imported commodities and relatively stable exchange rates also contributed to the deceleration in prices. A noteworthy factor shown in the analysis of causes for the price decline was the contribution made by the government budget in bringing down the rate of inflation. Financing a part of the capital budget through savings generated in the current account was a significant breakthrough in budgetary discipline in ameliorating the adverse effects of large cumulative budget deficits in the past. The sharp and impressive reductions in the budget deficit complemented the monetary policy measures pursued during the year. These achievements however, do not leave room for complacency. Budgetary deficits however, are still high and will have to be pruned down to assist the private sector's ability to use more resources for expansion of production and supplies. Demand management policies therefore require sharp reductions in excess liquidity build-up through strict budgetary discipline supplemented by resolute monetary policy measures. The rate of inflation which has been brought down has to be kept down by creating necessary conditions for the maintenance of continued price stability.",

The main improvement recorded in real wages was with regard to wor\u00adkers in Wages Boards trades. The real wages of workers in this category increased by 1.5 per cent due mainly to the real wage increase of 7.6 per cent of workers in agriculture whose money wages increased by 25.9 per cent in 1984. The moderate wage increases, received by industry, commerce and service workers governed by Wages Boards were not translated into an increase in their real wages. The money wage increase of certain categories of workers in the government sector was also moderate. The main income benefit to workers in the government sector came through two revisions made in the cost of living compensation in 1984. This kind of wage indexation may have adverse effects on demand management policies and will have to be reviewed in the light of need for pursuing a national wages policy to provide the necessary incentives to expand labour productivity consistent with growth in incomes and real wages.",

    "text": "The financing of investment in the face of sluggish growth in domestic savings in the past had resulted in a large imbalance between investment expenditure and available domestic resources. In the face of an unfavourable international environ\u00adment and deteriorating terms of trade the need to increase the savings effort in order to maintain a high level of public and private investment has been recognised. In the last few years, the investment/savings gap has been bridged mainly by recourse to foreign savings in the form of outright grants and concessional loans. It is noteworthy that recourse to commercial borrowing was on a limited scale and did not continue beyond 1983 because of the substantial gains made in foreign exchange reserves consequent on a favourable balance of payments position. This also reduced the extent of foreign savings in total investment financing significantly. Thus, the use of foreign savings dropped from 42 per cent of gross investment in 1983 to 12 per cent in 1984. Domestic savings amounted to 20.8 per cent of GDP in 1984, compared with 14.5 per cent in the previous year, while national savings augmented largely by worker remittances, increased to 23.2 per cent of GDP. Actual inflows of foreign savings exceeded the shortfall between the gross national savings and the gross domestic investment. The result was the reduced use of foreign savings which at 3 per cent of GDP was the lowest recorded during the last six years. The excess foreign savings was reflected in the overall surplus of the balance of payments.",

    "text": "Growth of Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF) slowed down further in 1984, when it increased by only 9 per cent compared with 21 per cent in 1983. Completion of a major part of the construction work under the Mahaweli Develop\u00adment Programme and the cut back in new capital expenditure by the government were mainly responsible for slower growth in GDCF. However, it is a matter for concern that despite the generous incentives available, private sector investment in a number of key areas had lagged behind. These factors have brought down GDCF to 26 per cent of GDP from the high average ratio of 30 per cent during the last four years. A salutary feature, however, has been the decline in the share of consumption in total expenditure thus indicating a shift of resources to investment. Consumption expenditure increased only by 15 percent as against 18 per cent growth in 1983. The outcome of this development was the remarkable increase in domestic savings referred to earlier. There is a strong need to maintain this high level of domestic savings by a further strengthening of fiscal management combined with restrictive monetary policies and increased domestic production. In view of the expected levelling off in foreign aid flows and possible growth in debt service burden no slippage should be allowed in the policy efforts to contain con\u00adsumption, enhance domestic savings and increase foreign earnings.",

Meanwhile, with a view to promoting the supply side, the pre-shipment export credit refinance facility was continued. Refinance schemes of the Central Bank came under review. The open ended refinance schemes to support non-traditional exports continued with further reductions in the interest rates. However, there was a reduction in the amount of refinance provided to non-traditional exports though provisions were made to enlarge the scheme in case the necessity arose.

With this level of operations the banking system will hardly make a dent in the total credit requirements of the rural agricultural sector.

The strong economic recovery in the United States of America gave a boost to production worldwide. But the global recovery remained uneven. Among the advanced industrial countries other than the United States only Japan and Canada registered moderately high rates of growth. Most European economies were saddled with restrictive fiscal policies and restive labour markets. The monetary policies in these countries were under severe pressure from the capital outflows to the United States. A slight downward movement in US interest rates was observed towards the third quarter of the year. Although crude oil prices firmed, in the middle of the year, they faced further downward pressure. Non-oil commodity prices, in US dollar terms, after peaking at the beginning of the year, slipped somewhat towards the third quarter of the year. Inflation declined in most of the industrialised countries and averaged about 5 per cent. However, low inflation was achieved at the cost of high unemployment. Increasing unemployment in industrialised countries strengthened protectionism hindering greater expansion in World trade. Nevertheless, the strong recovery of world trade in 1984 enabled most of the developing countries to improve their overall balance of payments position.",

Combined earnings from exports of tea, rubber and coconut increased by SDR 291 milhon. However, the underlying weaknesses in the balance of payments persisted. In the case of rubber and coconut, Sri Lanka was not able to reap the full benefits of high prices due to set backs in production\u2014rubber exports increased by only 0.8 per cent, while the nut equivalent of coconut exports declined by 44 per cent. A further disconcerting feature was the continued decline in exports of minor agri\u00adcultural crops. Effective measures are needed to revitalise this sub-sector. The same could be said of export of gems, which has shown a persistent decline in the last few years. A more encouraging feature of the trade performance was the large increase in exports of textile and garments and other industrial goods.",

A single sub-sector (tea) in the agri\u00adcultural sector was largely responsible for the upturn of the economy.

In the wake of the international debt crisis availability of foreign aid and loans are likely to be lower than in the past. In this context Sri Lanka faces an uphill task in sustaining the recent economic achievements and in achieving higher growth rates than at present. Therefore, concerted efforts at export promotion, and efficient import substitution need to be continued.

    "text": "Concentration on agriculture alone will not place the economy on a sustaina\u00adble growth path for the future. Whilst appreciating the Contributions made by high agricultural output in expanding income, employment, foreign reserves and expansion of base for industrial growth, steps will have to be taken to achieve a high rate of economic growth through outward looking export oriented non-traditional indus-tries. Sri Lanka's ability to solve the underlying weaknesses in her balance of pay\u00adments and to achieve rapid economic growth depends not only on using up excess capacity in agriculture through import substitution but also on a well designed indus\u00adtrial policy particularly directed towards exports. Performance in the industrial sector has been sluggish in the past. The incentive framework for industrial investment has tended to favour import substitution. However, the potential for import substitu\u00adting industrial development is rather limited due to the smalhiess of the domestic market. Though private manufacturing industry has responded fairly well to the export-led growth strategy, industrial exports have not expanded on z. broader front. Private investment in the past has been largely concentrated in areas with attractive incentives and high returns such as tourism, real estate development, trade and road passenger transport services.",

These measures included duty free import of machinery for export oriented industries, 'half tax holidays' for certain selected non-traditional export industries and the introduction of a new tariff structure on the basis of effective protection. These reforms are expected to have far reaching effects on the domestic manufacturing sector. However, a viable and dynamic industrial policy is still lacking.",

In this context, transport and communications play a vital role in providing necessary ancillary services for increasing the level of efficiency in the economy. In Sri Lanka shortcomings in the transport system, particularly in passenger transport, continue to be a constraint for development. In order to provide a satisfactory transport service to the public the Government has permitted the private sector to operate omnibus services. Since allowing private operators to enter the market a sizeable investment has taken place in passenger omnibus services which have correspondingly reduced the burden on the public sector services. Though the private sector has provided an extensive commuter service its initial investment is now becoming obsolete. The problem of replacement of assets is now looming over the private operators. Provi\u00adsion for replacement is an urgent requirement to avoid a major breakdown in road commuter services. The authorities should give much needed guidance and advice to the private investors on this important issue while taking measures to increase the efficiency in the public sector services.",

Improvements in budgetary policy have reversed this trend after 1983 and have effectively complemented the monetary policy measures in 1984.

Widening the revenue base and introducing effective measures for better compliance by tax payers should bring about the desired increase in government revenue. The time is ripe for a revision of investment incentives and tax holidays in the context of broader economic objectives.

The restruc\u00adturing of public enterprises should be implemented with urgency.
