It is interesting to note that the consumption of furnace oil decreased by 7 per cent, in 1984, showing the impact of the price increase in 1983. Further, the consumption of heavy diesel and furnace oil by all sectors registered substantial decreases due to the sharp drop in the use of fuel in electricity generation.

These measures included reducing losses in electricity generation, transmission and distribution, improving productivity of oil refinery operations and minimising wastage in handling and transport of oil. It is estimated that 19 per cent of the electricity generated is lost in the process of transmission and distribution. It is expected that this loss would be reduced through the network rehabilitation programme which is now underway. An area which received increased attention is the diversification of the energy sector and the development of substitute sources of energy for petroleum and electricity. Efficient and economic use of fuel wood, use of agricultural and other agro-waste materials as substitute fuel, increased use of direct solar and wind power were other particular areas to which policy attention was given during the year. Energy audits were carried out in selected public and private sector institutions (which were identified as large consumers) with the objective of improving the efficient use of energy.",
