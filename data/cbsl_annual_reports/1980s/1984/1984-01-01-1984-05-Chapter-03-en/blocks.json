It appears that many of the smallholders continue to adopt incorrect tapping methods and improper maintenance practices. The uneven and fluctuating performance of replanting, is a major weakness in the private sector. Therefore, the subsidy scheme should be kept under constant review with a view to making appropriate revisions to ensure consistent and systematic replanting in this sector. Also, urgent measures are required to improve the processing facilities in the private sector where bulk of the smallholders continue to adopt crude methods of processing with consequent adverse effects on quality. In this respect, a more systematic expansion of the scheme Of Group Processing Centres deserves policy attention. The scheme should be re\u00addesigned to integrate assistance for cultivation, processing and marketing.",

Both public and private plantations can play a more dynamic role in improving this sector. The Government has imposed no export duties on these crops, except for cinnamon on which there is a nominal duty. In February, 1984 with a view to providing a greater incentive, the BTT on trading of a number of minor export crops was also removed. Since the costs of production of most of these crops are quite low, produ\u00adcers appear to enjoy comfortable margins. Despite this, the overall performance of this sector has fallen far short of expectations and it has not been able to sustain a reasonable rate of growth. Thus, there appears to be structural factors on the supply side which act as constraints on rapid development of the sector. One such factor may be that most of the plant stock now in bearing may not be varieties that are capable of producing higher yields. Therefore, new investment and reinvestment in this sector will have to be accelerated to achieve better results in the future.",

Though the open market prices improved in 1984, the rise in cost of production, which appears to have exceeded 15 per cent in major producing districts, eroded producer margins.

There are uncultivated and under-utilized lands in certain parts of the country, particularly in the dry zone district of Moneragala, which are agro-climatically suitable for cane cultivation. Therefore, government has made, and continues to make, a concerted effort to increase investments in this industry.

Despite these efforts, the performance of the sector on average, has fallen short of expectations. The consumer prices of fish have increased continuously over the past few years. The shortfall in supplies in the face of increasing demand appears to have caused this trend. However, it is doubtful whether the benefits of this increasing trend in consumer prices trickled down to the fishermen. The available evidence indicates that most of the people employed in the fishing industry remain in the category of the absolutely poor. Thus, in general, neither the producers nor the consumers have been able to reap the benefits of the investments which went into this sector. It appears that a complete reorganization of the institutional structure and re-orientation of the investment programme and the incentives including subsidy schemes are required. A thorough evaluation of the past public sector investment in the sector appears to be urgently required for the formulation of better policies in the future.",
