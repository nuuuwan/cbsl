The increase was mainly due to the revision of wages in the plantation sector in April, 1984. Money wages of workers in agriculture alone rose by 25.9 per cent as compared to 9.7 per cent in the previous year. Workers in industry and commerce and service workers received wage increases of only 3.2 per cent and 1.1 per cent, respectively in 1984. The corresponding increases for the previous year were 1.3 per cent.and 4.8~per cent, respectively. Accordingly, it may be concluded that, with the exception of plantation workers, wage increases in other trades covered by Wages Boards were moderate in 1984. - ' . - ;",

Therefore, while most imports remained free of controls, the emphasis was on expanding both traditional and non-traditional exports. The large increase in exports and the stemming of import growth, are evidence of the success of these policies. In the case of imports, there is little doubt that the monetary policies aimed at restricting non-essential imports have been particularly effective. While the overall performance of the export sector has been encouraging, there have also been some changes in the structure of exports in 1984, affecting- exports other than agricultural exports. Thus, both exports of textile and garments and other industrial goods recorded large increases. However, some of the potential growth areas in the export sector such as minor agri\u00adcultural exports and gem exports have remained stagnant. The need for urgent policy initiatives to revitalise these sectors is therefore evident.",

The Board made a number of recommendations relating to tax incentives for the export sector .and these recommendations were incorporated in the Inland Revenue Amendment Bill in April, 1984.
