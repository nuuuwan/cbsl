INDUSTRY1

The performance of the industrial sector in 1984, showed a substantial overall improvement as compared with the last five years. This was reflected in the high rate of growth, rapid expansion of exports, renewed emphasis on investment in the garments sector and the revival of investor confidence. In real terms, industrial output is estimated to have increased by 15 per cent, the highest rateof growth recor­ded during the past decade. This achievement was made possible by the better per­formance of the private sector industries during the year. A similar improvement was clearly evident in industrial exports, which recorded a growth of 43 per cent (38 per cent in SDR terms). . -

The rapid-industrial growth in 1984 came front &--26 per cent growth in private sector industries and a 7 per cent growth in public sector industries. Public sector industries which recorded a decline in output in the previous year showed improved growth in 1984, particularly due to the un-interrupted operation of the oil refinery, which contributes 55 per cent of the public sector industrial output. Since a major share of total industrial output comes from oil refining and textile and garments, growth in the industrial sector is determined to a large extent on the performance of these two industries. Therefore, the diversification of industrial production requires attention as it is undesirable to leave the economic fortunes of the industrial sector to two industries whose contribution, in terms of domestic value added, is relatively low.

During the year under review, certain policy changes relating to the industrial sector were introduced with a view to consolidating the policies that were implemented since 1977. These changes were aimed at stimulating the export oriented industrial sector while affording sufficient protection to import substituting local industry. A ' half tax holiday' for certain selected non-traditional export industries for a further period of 10 years was granted in the 1985 Budget. This relief was designed to promote industries based principally on local raw materials and those with high domestic value added. Furthermore, with a view to developing the rural industrial sector and providing more employ­ment opportunities in the rural sector, investment relief upto one-third of assessable income of the investor was granted for the purchase of shares in companies which establish new laboun-intensive industries with an employment potential of at least 25 persons in districts other than the Colombo District.

Certain significant tariff changes were introduced during the year under review. The import duty structure was revised on the recommendations of the Presidential Tariff Commission. This Commission recommended tariff changes largely on the basis of effective levels of protection with a view to reducing disparities in the levels of

As in the past, the data relating to the performance of the industrial sector for 1984 are based on the returns to the questionnaires addressed by the bank to all known and registered manufacturing units - large, medium and small - in the public and private sectors.' However, these do not include the export processing activities of the plantation sector which are classi­fied as manufacturing activities in the National Accounts. Generally, replies, are received from about a third of addressees and these represent almost all of the major industries. In areas where data are not available, estimates based on the information available with various government agencies and institutions have been incorporated^

effective protection among local industries through a non-discriminatory tariff structure. These new tariff reforms were aimed at encouraging local production by removal of bias against production for export.

Investment

In the sphere of investment, the Local Investment Advisory Committees (LIACs) in the Ministries of Industries and Scientific Affairs, Textile Industries, and Fisheries approved 474 projects during the year as compared with 349 projects in the previous year. The projects approved in 1984 envisaged an investment of Rs. 567 milhon and were expected to provide employment opportunities to approximately 21,524 persons. The Rural Industry Advisory Cojmnktee (RIAC).in the Ministry of Rural Industrial Development approved 3 BEQieefcs in 1984* with an investment potential of Rs.lQ;5 milhon.

The- Foreign Investment Advisory Committee (FIAQ approved 41 projects in 1984 with an envisaged total investment of Rs. 1,283 milhon, of which the foreign component amounted to Rs. 522 million. The total erraployment potential of these projects was estimated at 8,785. Of the total number of approved projects, 14 were in the textile and Eeadymade garments sector. The Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) approved 15 projects in 1984, with a potential investment of R& 678 miUion» representing a two-fold increase as compared with the previous year. Accordingly, the GCEC had approved a total of 199 projects by the end of the year. Of these, 112 enterprises have signed agreements with the GCEC to set up various industries.

Production

Overall industrial output is estimated to have increased significantly by 15 per cent in 1984 as compared with the 2 per cent growth recorded in the previous year. This higher rate of growth was the result of a 26 per cent growth in the private sector industries and a 7 per cent growth m the public sector industries. Total industrial output in public and private sectors excluding the output of the Petroleum Corpora­tion is estimated to have increased by 9 per cent.

Industrial sub-sectors that recorded increases in production were textile, wearing apparel and leather products (44 per cent), fabricated metal products (24 per cent) chemicals, petroleum and plastic products (18 per cent), paper and paper products (12 per cent) and food, beverages and tobacco products (3 per cent). On the other hand, the output of basic metal products decreased by 31 per cent, non-metallic mineral products by 9 per cent and wood and wood products by 8 per cent.

The total value of industrial production in current terms, in 1984, is estimated to have increased by 25 per cent as compared with an increase of 10 per cent in 1983. 'When the value of petroleum products is excluded, industrial production is estimated to have grown by 21 per cent. This increase came mainly from the textile and wearing apparel sector where production in the export-oriented garment industry, specially in the Investment Promotion Zone (IPZ)andin the textile mills of the National Textile Corporation recorded a very large increase of 47 per cent.

( 29 )

Large increases were also recorded in fabricated metal products (29 per-cent), food, beverages and tobacco products (23 per cent), wood and wood products (23 per cent), non-metalHc mineral products (25per cent).and chemicals, petroleum and rubber products (21 per cent). Production of basic metal products declined by. 34 per cent.

Power and Fuel •- .;.••'•

The most significant feature of power and fuel use in industry in 1984 was the-substantial decline of 46 per cent in the use of industrial fuel. This, however, -was solely due to the reduced consumption of heavy diesel and furnace cril -by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) resulting from the reduction in its thenna'lpower generation.

The sale of heavy diesel in 1934 excluding sales to the CEB, registered an increase of 12 per cent, while that of furnace oil recorded a marginal increase of one per cent over that of 1983. Electricity continued to be the most widely used source of energy in industry with consumption increasing by 5 per cent in the year under review.

Public Sector Industry

Several noteworthy developments can be highlighted in the performance of public sector industry. A new mammoty manufacturing plant of the Ceylon State Hardware Corporation was commissioned in January, 1984. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) entered into an agreement with Petro-Canada International Assistance Corporation in March, 1984 for financial and technical assistance to carry out geo-physical surveys for off-shore oil exploration. The CPC also entered into a joint venture agreement with a three-nation consortium in April 1984, to rehabilitate the Trincomalee Tank Farm, which comprises 99 oil tanks with a total capacity of a milhon metric tons of oil and upgrade it to an international oil storage complex.

Tn real terms, the overall output of public sector industrial enterprises increased by 7 per cent in 1984 as against a 15 per cent decline recorded in 1983. This increase came mainly from the 22 per cent rise in the output of the petroleum refinery which operated without any shutdown in 1984. The output of the public sector enterprises (excluding the CPC) recorded a decline of 8 per cent in the year under review.

As in previous years the performance of public corporations was uneven. The corporations that showed increases in output were the State Distilleries (32 per cent), National Textile (19 per cent), State Fertilizer Manufacturing (12 per cent), Ceylon Plywoods (10 per cent) and State Mining and Mineral Development (2 per cent). Decreases in output levels were experienced by the Ceylon Leather Products (39 per

cent), Ceylon Steel (31 per cent), State Timber (27 per cent), National Salt (23 per cent), Sri Lanka Tyre (19 percent,) Sri Lanka Sugar (18 per cent), Sri Lanka Cement (15 per cent), National Paper (13 per cent), Ceylon Oils and Fats (12 per cent), Paranthan Chemicals and Ceylon Ceramics (11 per cent each), State Hard­ware (7 per cent) Corporations and the National Milk Board (11 per cent).

There were varied reasons for these declines. The Steel and Paper Corporations experienced production problems due to short supply of raw materials. The National Salt Corporation's production dropped as a result of the delay in the commencement of the second harvest due to adverse weather conditions. The decline in output of the Ceylon Ceramics Corporation could be attributed to the temporary shutdown of the sanitaryware factory and the curtailment of production of items such as mosaic tiles and insulators due to marketing problems. The Paran­than Chemicals Corporation was compelled to curtail its production due to slow movement of stocks and operational problems.

With respect to sales, the majority of corporations performed well in 1984 when compared with their sales performance in 1983. According to available data, the corporations that experienced improvements in their sales performance were the ' State Distilleries, State Mining and Mineral Development, State Hardware, Ceylon Oils & Fats.Ceylon Mineral Sands, Ceylon Leather Products, State Timber, Ceylon Plywoods- and National Paper Corporations. Marketing problems on account of competition from imports adversely affected sales of the Ceylon Steel Corpo­ration. •

The emphasis at present on management of public enterprises on a commercially viable basis was responsible for most corporations recording profits in 1984. Among them, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation recorded an unprecedented profit of Rs.l,717..nullion. The decline in crude oil prices and domestic price increases effec­ted in 1983, contributed to the favourable operational results of this Corporation. Among the other public sector enterprises that recorded profits in 1984 were the National Salt, Ceylon Leather Products, State Distilleries, State Timber, National Paper, Ceylon Mineral Sands and State Mining and Mineral Develop­ment Corporations. The Ceylon Steel, State Hardware, Sri Lanka Sugar .and State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporations continued to incur losses in the year under review. In addition, the Ceylon Ceramics Corporation which recorded a profit in the previous year, incurred a loss in 1984. In general, problems arising < from breakdown of machinery, shortage of raw materials, lack of skilled per­sonnel and financial constramts such asinsufficieait. woiMng capital contributed to the unsatisfactory operational results of these corporations. j

In 1984, Government transfer payments to public sector industrial enterprises amounted to Rs. 1,036 million consisting of Rs. 460 million of capital transfers and Rs. 576 million in the form of current transfers. The Sri Lanka Sugar, National Textile, Ceylon Oils and Fats, State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporations and the National Milk Board were the major recipients of these transfers.

Investment Promotion Zone

In 1984, fifteen projects were approved by the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) bringing the totaljiumber of projects approved to 199 by the end of 1984. Of these, 112 enterprises have signed agreements with the GCEC to set up industries. Out of a total of 74 enterprises (62 of them in Katunayake Investment Promotion Zone) that were in commercial production, 32 were engaged in the production of readymade garments., The total number employed in GCEC enterprises amounted to 29,251* in December, 1984 as compared with 26,053* in December, 1983. Although a large number of projects are in the garments sector, project approvals in the last few years have shown a welcome trend towards greater diversification of industrial acitvity in the IPZ.

Of the fifteen projects approved in 1984, four each were in textiles and manu­factured products, three in fabricated metal products, two in services and one each in chemical products and wood and wood products. A wide variety of

4 This excludes employment with Air Lanka Ltd.,

( 34 )

products such as clothing, sports goods, rubber based products, cosmetic accessories, light engineering products, electronic components and electrical applian­ces are manufactured for export.

Gross earnings from GCEC exports increased by 46 per cent amounting to Rs. 1,119 million (SDR 49 million) in 1984. The garments and footwear sector accounted for the highest amount of export earnings (50 per cent) in 1984 as in the previous year. In this sector export earnings per employee, in SDR terms, increased by 30 per cent. The other sectors of the GCEC that recorded increases in export earnings were beverages and tobacco products, steel fabricated metal products and plastic products.

The GCEC's Second Investment Promotion Zone at Biyagama which covers an area of 450 acres is presently under construction. This zone which is scheduled to be in operation in 1985, will have infra&tructural facilities similar to that of the Katuna-yake Investment Promotion Zone.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OVERHEADS

Energy

In 1984, Sri Lanka experienced an improved energy situation. This development was the result of lower international prices for petroleum products as well as the higher domestic generation of hydro electricity consequent on improved weather conditions. Sri Lanka was able to benefit from declining world oil prices by purchasing over
