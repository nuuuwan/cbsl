This was reflected in the high rate of growth, rapid expansion of exports, renewed emphasis on investment in the garments sector and the revival of investor confidence. In real terms, industrial output is estimated to have increased by 15 per cent, the highest rateof growth recor\u00added during the past decade. This achievement was made possible by the better per\u00adformance of the private sector industries during the year. A similar improvement was clearly evident in industrial exports, which recorded a growth of 43 per cent (38 per cent in SDR terms). . -",

Public sector industries which recorded a decline in output in the previous year showed improved growth in 1984, particularly due to the un-interrupted operation of the oil refinery, which contributes 55 per cent of the public sector industrial output. Since a major share of total industrial output comes from oil refining and textile and garments, growth in the industrial sector is determined to a large extent on the performance of these two industries. Therefore, the diversification of industrial production requires attention as it is undesirable to leave the economic fortunes of the industrial sector to two industries whose contribution, in terms of domestic value added, is relatively low.",

A ' half tax holiday' for certain selected non-traditional export industries for a further period of 10 years was granted in the 1985 Budget. This relief was designed to promote industries based principally on local raw materials and those with high domestic value added. Furthermore, with a view to developing the rural industrial sector and providing more employ\u00adment opportunities in the rural sector, investment relief upto one-third of assessable income of the investor was granted for the purchase of shares in companies which establish new laboun-intensive industries with an employment potential of at least 25 persons in districts other than the Colombo District.",
