Time and savings'deposits held by the other private sector constituents (OPSC) rose by 15 per cent in 1984 when compared with 27'per cent in 1983. The reduced rate of expansion in OPSC deposits was in part caused by the outflow of deposits from commercial banks to other deposit mobilising institutions, such as, the National Savings Bank (NSB) and finance companies in response to relatively larger reductions effected in deposit rates by commercial banks. The: growth of deposits of co\u00adoperative institutions held with commercial banks also decelerated from 31 per cent in 1983 to 12 per cent in 1984. i i",

The decelera\u00adtion in GCPS was largely attributable to the selective credit control measures intro\u00adduced by the Central Bank in March and May 1984 through which restrictions\"were imposed on non-priority lendihgs. Moreover, the rising incomes of the export sector reduced the demand for investment funds. Bank credit to OPSC rose by Rs. 4,104 milhon; (16 per cent) in 1984 compared with an increase of Rs. 6,170 million (32 per \u00a3ent) in 1983. The increase in credit to the OPSC took the form of loans (Rs. 2,861 milhon), overdrafts (Rs. 988 million) and import bills (Rs. 116 million). Bank credit for imports and consumption recorded a drop while, credit for export, retail and wholesale trading, commerce and industry rose during the year. Commercial ;bank credit to co-operative institutions declined by Rs. 255 million\"t(14 per cent) in 1984 in contrast to a substantial increase of Rsv 635 million (54 per cent) in the previous year. The decline in borrowings of co-operatives was mainly on account of the drop in goods receipt advances granted to the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) for the purchase and marketing of paddy by Rs. 331 million. The decline in credit to the PMB was the result of its reduced role in marketing acti\u00advities and the limit placed'on refinance by the Central Bank in March, 1984. Bank credit to government corporations declined by Rs. 237 million (6 per cent) in 1984 compared to a decline of Rs. 292 milhon (6 per cent) in 1983. This decline was the net result of a drop in overdrafts by Rs. 522 milhon and increases in loans, cash items and import bills,-by Rs. 285 million. The major contributory factor for the decline in overdrafts vas the repayment of outstanding debt to commercial banks by the two plantation corporations due to their improved financial position.

This was primarily caused by the continuous inflow of liquidity through enhanced external earnings and increased mobilization of deposits at the begining of the year through high deposit rates. The withdrawal of temporary accomodation granted by the Central Bank to commercial banks under the penal rate in late 1983 compelled the commercial banks to improve their hqiiidity position through increased mobilization of deposits. Accordingly, most banks, including the two state banks, increased interest rates on both time and savings deposits in early 1984, especialy on short-term deposits. Consequently, the time and savings deposits of the private sector rose by Rs. 2,413 milhon, during the first half of the year. Moreover, the credit restrictions on lending to. non-priority sectors limited the lending activities of commercial banks which contributed to the excess liquidity situation.",

The excess liquidity position of commercial banks was also reflected in the enhanced transactions in the Secondary Treasury bill (STB) market.

The effective lending rates on borrowings under the preshipment export credit refinance facility was reduced by 1 percentage point to 12 per cent per annum. Similar adjustments were made in the supplementary refinance facility where the effective lending rate was reduced by 1 percentage point to 8.75 per cent per annum. The rates on cultivation and marketing refinance facilities remained unchanged except in the case of refinance granted to the PMB which was raised by 2 percentage points for refinance above Rs. 400 milhon in order to restrict drawings under the facility and to discourage the PMB from resorting to extention of refinance periods.",

The National Savings Bank (NSB) was allowed the freedom to fix its deposits and lending rates in April, 1984 indicating a departure from the practice followed hitherto, in fixing its deposit rates with the approval of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. This pohcy change has been effected in the context of reduced borrowing requirements of the Government and also to allow the NSB to diversify its assets portfolio thus venturing into investment in profitable outlets. Accordingly, the NSB reduced its twelve-month fixed deposit rate (at maturity) from 20 to 18 per cent per annum with effect from July, 1984. The rate on six - month fixed deposits was also reduced by one percentage point to 14 per cent per annum.",

However, once the deposit mobilization targets were met, rates were reduced to levels that prevailed in the last quarter of 1983 and were further reduced during the second half of 1984. Therefore, following the excess liquidity situation and the reduction in rates by their competitor, the NSB, majority of commercial banks reduced deposit rates by varying amounts and at different times, thereby bringing the entire short term deposit rate structure to a lower level. However, certain banks continued to offer high rates on a selective basis.",

In fact, there has been no general reduction in lending rates by any commercial bank except, the isolated and marginal adjustments effected on a selective basis. Commercial banks reduced deposit rates throughout the second half of the year. It was however, evident that there has been a reduction in the cost of mobilization towards the end of the year and the begining of 1985 due to the maturity of six month deposits and the acceptance of new deposits at lower rates. In the absence of adequate savings and investment outlets, the public's preference to hold on to interest bearing financial assets i.e. savings and fixed deposits, is quite evident in the case of Sri Lanka. This is especially so, at times in which inflationary expectations are reduced. In this^ context, commercial banks are still in a position to attract financial savings at reduced rates.",

Also, the rate on Treasury bills moved upwards by two percentage points to 14 per cent per annum in both, primary and secondary Treasury bill markets during the year.

Having considered the impact of the Government budgetary operations and the external sector on monetary aggregates, the total permissible level of outstanding credit to the private sector by all commercial banks at end 1984 was targetted at Rs. 36,537 million at the outset of the year. Consequently, private sector credit was estimated to increase by Rs. 5,129 milhon or 16 per cent during 1984. As in the previous year, agriculture, industry and export sectors continued to be the priority areas in sectoral deployment of credit.",

    "text": "The restrictive monetary and credit policy measure's introduced by the Central Bank in early 1984 resulted in a decline in bank credit compared with the initial quarterly targets. Shortfalls were recorded in the utilization of credit in all sectors, except housing, during the year. However, industrial and export sectors received1 about 95 per cent of the total credit allocation in 1984. . It is noteworthy to mention that despite the exemption from credit ceilings, agricultural credit lagged behind the targets throughout the year. This sector recorded the largest shortfall in credit utilisation which amounted to about Rs. 545 milhon or 13 per cent. The role played by the commercial banks in lending activities for agriculture was largely confined to the provision of short-term working capital, including marketing where the funds were mostly available under the Central Bank refinance facilities and no appreciable attempts were made to channel credit to most needy medium and long term investments in the agricultural sector. The poor performances in agricultural lending was highlighted at credit plan review meetings and banks were requested to play a more active role in agricultural lending in the forthcoming years.",

    "text": "The restrictive credit pohcy measures that were in effect during 1984 were suc\u00adcessful to a large extent in containing the annual growth in domestic credit towards the latter part of the year. The rate of growth of domestic credit which was at 16 per cent at end 1983 decelerated gradually to a level of 1 per cent by end 1984. This appreciable deceleration in credit expansion, particularly in the private sector and the partial absorption of excess liquidity in the banking system were largely attributable to the policy measures introduced during the year. The increase in credit to the private sector which stood at 26 per cent at end 1983 was progressively reduced to a rate of 11 per cent by the end of the year through selective credit control measures.",

    "text": "The year 1984 witnessed a substantial moderation in the rate of increase in monetary aggregates and the price levels. The moderation was more pronounced in narrow money. On the price front, there was a significant abatement in the rate of inflation. Along with the moderate increase, in the Colombo Consumers' Price Index, the rate of increase in the Wholesale Price Index also registered a substantial drop, The expansionary impact of the increased foreign assets and the inflationary pressures in the economy were somewhat neutralized through the monetary policy measures adopted during the year. Meanwhile, the fiscal policy measures of the Government effectively complemented the monetary policy measures. The consi\u00adderable reduction in government borrowings from the banking sector, contributed in restraining ; undue monetary expansion. Nonetheless, these favourable achievements were not reflected r fully in the real sector largely due to structural and institutional deficiencies.;' , . . \u2022 ,",
