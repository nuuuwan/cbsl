These amounts do not include repayments of principal in respect of FCBU loans to GCEC enterprises and some unidentified FCBU loans. However, interest payments on these loans are included. During the year, repurchases and interest and service payments in respect of IMF transactions amounted to Rs. 593 million (SDR 23 million) and Rs. 819 million (SDR 31 million), respectively. The corresponding, figures for 1983 were Rs. 1,097 million (SDR 46 million) and Rs. 749 million (SDR 31 million), respectively. The overall ratio in SDR terms, of total debt service payments to export earnings from goods and services decreased from 21.9 per cent in 1983 to 17.2 per cent in 1984. This reduction was mainly due to the increase in export earnings. Debt service ratio, excluding IMF transactions decreased from 16.0 per cent in 1983 to 14.1 per cent in 1984. The overall debt service payments as a ratio of the receipts from merchandise exports, services and private transfers decreased from 18.1 per cent to 14.7 per centbetween 1983 and 1984.",

Numerous revenue measures so far introduced and the improve\u00adments effected in the revenue system appeared to be inadequate to make revenue elastic and buoyant. This further emphasised the necessity for a continuous aggressive revenue mobilization effort involving, measures for widening the tax \u2022coverage and the tax base.
