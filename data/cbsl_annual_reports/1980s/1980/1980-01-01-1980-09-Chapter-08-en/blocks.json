The decline in terms of trade was a major factor contributing to the adverse trade balance recorded. While import prices increased by 43 per cent, the export prices increased by only 16 per cent thus resulting in a decline in the terms of trade by 19 per cent. In comparison with the other countries in the region, Sri Lanka appears to have been the worst affected. Information available indicates that although the terms of trade of countries such as Philippines and even Singapore declined, the impact has been less severe than in the case of Sri Lanka.",

However, the rate of growth in SDR terms amounted to 6 per cent which was approximately 50 per cent of the rate of growth of the previous year. Earnings from exports of tea, rubber, minor agricultural crops, and industrial exports increased in rupee value while those of coconut kernel products and gems declined: As the rate of growth of the major export crops lagged behind that of industrial exports, the relative share of the export crop sector declined from 65 per cent in 1979 to 58 per cent of total exports in 1980. However, the shares of petroleum and textiles exports increased from 13 per cent in- 1979 to 17 per cent in 1980 and from 7 per cent in 1979 to 11 per cent, in 1980, respectively. The value of exports of petroleum products was higher than that of rubber which, traditionally figures as Sri Lanka's second largest foreign exchange earne.-. Tea exports, however continued to be the principal export item accounting for 36 per cent of total value of exports.",

The higher prices realised at the Colombo auctions were largely the result of a reduction of Rs. 5.00 per kilo in the export duty on bulk tea which was effected in July, 1979 and partially the result of the depreciation of the Sri Lanka Rupee. Of the total tea exports, 83 per cent was shipped in bulk form. Though prices fetched were higher in 1980 than in 1979, the industry as a whole suffered from liquidity problems due to rising costs. Nearly a third of the income derived from tea was absorbed by the government by way of duties and cesses.",

The average f.o.b. price improved from Rs. 19.44 in 1979 to Rs. 21.42 in 1980 or by 10 per cent, reflecting in large measure the depreciation in the exchange value of the Sri Lanka Rupee. The f.o.b. price when measured in SDR terms recorded an increase of 3 per cent. The quantity of rubber exported decreased by 7 million kilos from 128 million kilos in 1979 to 121 million kilos. Price increases were seen in the Colombo market where the annual avarage prices of RSS No. 1 and II increased from Rs. 9.15 to Rs. 10.62 and from Rs. 8.56 to Rs. g.73 per kilo, respectively. In 19C0, rubber stocks remained relatively high. The Chinese purchases of Sri Lanka natural rubber have shown a gradual reduction in the past few years. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage the export of sheet rubber by the private sector to other destinations in the larger interest of the industry.",

The increased earnings from petroleum exports were largely due to increases in export prices. The increased earnings from textile and garment exports were the result of both increases in price and volume. The volume of garment exports increased from 34 million units in 1979 to 5 2 million units in ig8o.Textile exports from the Industrial Processing Zone of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission have been estimated at Rs. 470 million.

    "text": "The overall performance of the export sector in 1980 was far from encouraging; in fact, somewhat disappointing. The export volumes of all export sectors with the exception of industrial exports declined. The increase in the international! prices-a consequenc of world inflation - resulted in export earnings showing: some improvement. However, in the context of the phenomenon of deteriorating terms of trade which Sri Lanka is experiencing since 1977 & more; concerted effort has to be made in order to increase the level of growth of exports while improving the . fortunes of the traditional sector. In view of the . near stagnant, demand for tea and supply constraints impeding the growth of rubber and coconut' exports, considerably greater attention has to be given towards the develbpment1.; of the non-traditional exports. Agro-based manufactured goods which use;rubber and other minor agricultural products as raw materials mayl be one such area which could be developed. Given the high weightage accorded to import ofcapital and investment goods and the worldwide inflation which tends to keep import values continuously rising, the principal instrument for containing the widening' merchandise trade deficit would appear to be a vigorous and sustained export development programme on a very broad front. :",

This'* sharp increase in the value of imports was mainly the result of a 43 per cent increase in the Import Price Index. The volume of imports too increased by 14 per cent. However, the previously observed change in the composition of imports continued in 1980 aswell. The share of consumer goods in total imports decreased from 35 per cent in 1979.10 29 per cent hi 1980 while the category of intermediate goods increased its relative share from 41 per cent to 46 per cent. The share of investment goods remained unchanged at 24 per cent. In spite of sharp j increases in c.i.f prices, the government's objective of diverting more. resources to investment oriented activities, thus favouring real capital formation, appears to have succeeded. However, the sharp increase in the price of crude oil was a major set-back as it pre-empted resources from other uses. \\",

While the Import Volume Index recorded an increase of 19 per cent in the investment goods category, the price index increased by 10 per cent. The price index of the building materials recorded the highest level of increase viz. 63 per cent while machinery and equipment and transport equipment increased by 14 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.

The Board has attempted at a systematic identification of the basic constraints affecting the growth of exports in both products sector, as well as in functional areas (e.g. export finance). Products such as jewellery, white coir fibre products, tea bags and packeted tea and rubber products were given additional incentives on the basis of these studies. In this context the Board initiated programmes to provide credit for production of goods for export at reasonable cost and licences were issued for the import of raw materials used in the manufacture of jewellery for export. An Export Expansion Grant Scheme and a Presidential Export Awards Scheme were in operation to encourage exporters. The Import Duty Rebate Scheme was streamlined to facilitate prompt refunds. Financial support was given for pilot projects and for participation in international trade fairs. Feasibility studies have been undertaken for the establishment of limited liability companies with the participation of both producers and exporters .to cultivate minor export crops such as cardamom and pepper and. for the takeover of the operations of the canning factories, presently managed by the Department for Development of Marketing. In addition, the Export Development Board has undertaken to finance the establishment of a comprehensive research laboratory for marine products. With the assistance of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the.Board initiated a programme of market development for the hand^om industry and carried out surveys on the supply conditions of a number of specific products*. \u2022 ~",
