The total utilization of loan finances however, recorded a decrease. As at end of 1980 the aggregate utilization of loans contracted since 1970 was 56 per cent. In 1979 this ratio stood at 60 per cent. A low level of utilization was noticeable in project loans where the utilization rate was as low as 36 per cent. Commodity loans registered a utilization rate of 81 per cent, while cash loans were fully utilized.",

Domestic credit expansion during the year was Rs. 1 1 , 1 7 4 million or 80 per cent.. Both the private sector and the government sector shared in the increased bank credit. Gross credit to private sector increased by Rs. 5 , 1 2 3 million during the year, while net credit to Government rose by Rs. 6,051 million. Under the impact of this sharp and unparalleled credit expansion, there was increased pressure oh the,' balance of payments, leading to loss of reserves. Altogether net external banking assets declined in 1980 by Rs. 4,096 million or 85 per cent. The fall in external banking assets helped to moderate the adverse monetary implications o f very high credit expansion. It, however, considerably weakened the external financial position of the country by the end of the year.",

Thus, the year 1980 witnessed a small deceleration in the rate of growth of monetary aggregates, even though the--rates of growth were still appreciably high. During the year, the monetary aggregates moved somewhat erratically. The annual rate of growth of M j which recorded a 29 per cent level as at the end of December, 1979 declined to 24 per cent by the end of March 1980, remained unchanged at this level until the end of June, decreased further to a relatively low level of 15 per cent in September, increased sharply during the next two months to reach 24 per cent at the end of November and decreased marginally to 23 per cent in December, 1980. Following roughly the same pattern, M2 declined from 38 per cent as at the end of December, 1979 to 24 per cent in March, remaining broadly at this level until July, but rising progressively to reach 32 per cent by the end of December, 1980.",

    "text": "During 1980, while currency held by the public increased by Rs. 407 million or 1 1 per cent, demand deposits of the public rose faster by Rs. 1,352 million or 35 per cent. Consequently, the share of demand deposits in Mj, which stood at 51 per cent as at the end of 1979, increased sharply to 56 per cent by the end of 1980. The experience in the past few years showed that there was no significant change in the public's preference to hold currency as against demand deposits; but the developments in 1980 indicated a marked shift in favour of demand deposits. If this trend were to continue, it could be considered as an indicator of a furthering of the banking habit among the public. It provides a bigger leeway for com\u00admercial banks to create credit, since the ratio of currency to demand deposits is an important determinant of the credit multiplier which ultimately determines the size of the money supply.",

    "text": "Expansion in narrow money as well as in quasi money was responsible for the growth in M 2 during the year under review. Time and savings deposits of the private sector rose by Rs. 3,044 million or 4 1 per cent in 1980, as compared with an increase of Rs. 2,432 million or 49 per cent during the preceding year. Of. the increase in the time and savings deposits during 1980, the other private sector constituents accounted for a major share amounting to Rs. 2,442 million or 80 per cent, while the share of public corporations was Rs. 544 million or 18 per cent. In comparison, the time and savings deposits of the co-operative institutions recorded a marginal increase of Rs. 58 million. However, during the early part of the year, there was a slowing down in the rate of growth of private sector time and savings deposits. The increase during the first four months was only Rs. 607 million or 8 per cent, as against a much larger rise of Rs. 1,335 million or 2 7 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year. The deceleration in the rate of growth of time and savings deposits during this period can be mainly attributed to a decline in the real rates of return on such deposits against continuing inflationary pressures in the economy. There were compelling circumstances for an upward revision of the deposit rates and this was effected in May, 1980. Since then, the growth of private sector deposits with commercial banks accelerated once, again. During the last eight months of 1980, time and savings deposits of the private sector rose sharply by Rs. 2,437 million or 30 per cent, recording a monthly average increase of Rs. 305 million, a3 against a much lower monthly average increase of Rs. 152 million during the first 4 months of the year. Accordingly, the year 1980 as a whole recorded a monthly average rise of Rs. 254 mil'ion in private sector time and savings deposits with commercial banks, as compared with a monthly average increase of Rs. 203 million during the preceding year.",

In fact, net credit to Government (NCG) rose unprecedentedly by Rs. 6,051 million or 207 per cent during the year, as compared with a relatively moderate increase of Rs. 1,057 million or 57 Pe r cent m the preceding year. Government's borrowings from the banking system during 1980 was mainly in the form of Treasury bills. In the absence of any significant subscriptions from non-bank sources, the Central Bank was called upon to subscribe to successive issues of Treasury bills and the Central Bank's contribution to the total issue of Treasury bills as at the end of the year was Rs. 9,604 million or 98 per cent. Consequently, gross credit to Government (GCG) by the Central Bank rose by a record Rs. 7,123 million or 185 per cent. However, Government's borrowings from commercial banks increased by only a moderate Rs. 76 million or 9 per cent. The sharp increase in the GCG was, however, partially off-set by a considerable build-up of Government deposits and cash balances with the banking system amounting to Rs. 1,147 million or 64 per cent. This was, however, made possible by a heavy use of Central Bank credit during the closing months of 1980. The heavy reliance of the Government on the banking system in financing the budget deficit increased the Government's share in the DCE from 29 per cent in 1979 to 54 per cent in 1980.",

The outcome is wholly explained by the sharp decline in the quantity of paddy purchased by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) during the year. Paddy purchases by the PMB decreased from 541.2 thousand metric tons ini97gto2ii.3 thousand metric tons in 1980.

On account of the larger absolute increase in credit during the second half, the monthly average increase in GCOP rose from Rs. 331 million during the first half to Rs. 426 million during the second half of the year.

The decline in external assets (net) during 1980 was the combined outcome of a sharp decline in the International Reserve (net) of the Central Bank by Rs. 4,677 million, off-set by an increase in the external assets (net) of commercial banks by Rs. 581 million.",

    "text": "The decline in external banking assets (net) in 1980 was the outcome of a significant deterioration in the country's balance of payments position. Under the impact of a very sharp increase in the import bill, the deficit on trade account widened considerably during the year. The trade deficit in 1980 was Rs. 16,140 million, as compared with a deficit of Rs. 7,288 million in the previous year. The higher trade deficit, in turn, led to a higher current account deficit which rose from Rs. 3,556 million in 1979 to Rs. 10,739 million in 1980. The substantially widened current account deficit was only partially financed by net receipts of long-term capital and resources made available from the I.M.F. and market borrowings, leaving a considerable overall deficit which had to be met by running-down accumulated reserves.",

During the year, commercial banks' resources increased by Rs. 7,948 million, which was the highest ever on record for any single year. In comparison, total resources in 1979 aggregated Rs. 4,817 million. Changes in all major categories of liabilities contributed to enlarge the resource base of com\u00admercial banks in 1980. Conforming.to the pattern observed in the past few years, the increase in deposits provided the main.impetus to the resource growth during the year. Both, demand and time and savings deposits registered sharp increases, but the growth in time and savings deposits accounted for the major share. In all, time and savings deposits rose to Rs. 3,094 million, largely in response to the upward revision of interest rates on these deposits during the first half of the year. Resource accrual through increases in deposits was further augmented by the increase in other liabilities of Rs. 1,591 million. This arose largely on account of profits of the banks and interest payable held in suspense. The increase in paid-up capital, reserve funds and undistributed profits also contributed to enhance commercial banks' resources during the year.",

The monetary situation in the first quarter of 1980 showed disturbing signs, indicating that the year would end up with undesirably high growth in monetary aggregates, particularly if the domestic credit expansion was to continue at the same pace as in the first quarter. Though the gradated scale of penal rates was meant to make the commercial banks more cost conscious, there was evidence to show that the commercial banks, particularly the two state sector banks, were once again resorting to heavy Central Bank borrowings. By the end of the first quarter, the commercial banks' borrowings from the Central Bank at the Bank rate and at penal rates rose sharply to Rs. 394 million and Rs. 937 million, respectively. It was evident that the heavy seasonal demand for credit specially for import purposes was met by resorting to increased credit from the Central Bank. Moreover, in the context of two digit, inflation for the 4th successive year, there were signs of a set back to the momentum of deposit mobilisation effected since the August/September, 1977 interest rate reform. Hence, urgent action was required to restrict credit creation capacity of commercial banks, on the one hand, and to provide a positive rate of return to savers, on the other. At the same time, commercial banks continued to make numerous requests to Central Bank requesting an enhancement of the export credit refinance facility.",

    "text": "In bridging a budget deficit of this magnitude the government resorted to borrowings from domestic as well as foreign sources. It should be pointed out that a budget deficit financed from foreign borrowing is relatively non-inflationary to the extent that the accrual of foreign exchange enables domestic supplies to be augmented from abroad, while at the same time minimising a redaction in the country's external reserves.' Borrowing from d>.nestic non-bank source tends to be non-inflationary as real resources are mobilised from incomes ahead/ generated and are substractions from income flows. Borrowings from the banking systm, particularly from the Central Bank, provide more definitive inflationary causation and pressure on the balance of payments, as such resources not only constitute newly i created money but also increase the liquidity base of the banking system.",

    "text": "The resources available to finance the 1980 budget defbit such as foreign aid and domestic market borrowing were limited. In the absence of non-inflationary financing sources the Government financed the residual gap by borrowing from the Central Bank. The increased borrowings from the Central Bank came in the form of fresh issues of Treasury bills. The volume of Treasury bills outstanding increased by Rs. 6,800 million and the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills rose by approximately Rs. 7 billion. The statutory limit on Treasury bills was raised to provide for these increases. The effect on the economy of government's inaationary deficit financing was to raise money supply and to swell the level of aggregate demand in the economy. The expansion of aggregate demand stemmed from both increased expenditure by the government as well as through increases in com\u00admercial bank credit to the private sector.",

    "text": "In 1980 the availability of exchange reserves for financing imports permitted a moderation in the rate of increase in the price level. The annual average of the Colombo Consumers' Price Index registered an increase of 26 per cent in 1980. The Wholesale Price Index of the Central Bank too showed a higher increase in in 1980 over the previous year. The annual average of the index increased by 34 per cent in 1980 compared with a 9 per cent increase in 1979. Monetary aggregates too sho.ved increases of similar magnitudes. Money supply (M x by 23 per cent and M 2 by 32 per cent) increased despite the running down of external reserves by 72 per cent. Resultant pressures on balance of payments led to a depreciation of the Sri Lanka Rupee vis-a-vis major currencies. This depreciation of the exchange rate was most marked during the second half of th: year. The pattern of developments witnessed in 1980 of a high level of expenditure, increase in the money supply, running d )wn of external reserves and a depreciation of the exchange rate, emphasise that an economy cannot continue to withstand a level of aggregate demand which is in excess of the availability of real resources. Increases in aggregate demand result in \"overheating\" and it is only a reduction in the level of demand which offers a longer term solution.",

From the point of view of the private sector the insti\u00adtution of a credit budget so that the rate of absorption of resources by the two sectors could be specifically provided for and these be matched with the rate of growth of supplies would permit a better management of the economy.
