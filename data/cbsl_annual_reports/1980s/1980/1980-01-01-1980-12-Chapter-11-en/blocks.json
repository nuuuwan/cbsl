To an appreciable extent these develop\u00adments in 1980 were the result of a failure to pursue a policy of fiscal stabilisation through conscious fiscal discipline. There were many pressures, both within and outside the control of Government, which made adherence to a strict budgetary programme and fiscal discipline a formidable task. Voted estimates of expenditure were frequently revised in the course of the fiscal year to accommodate.additional commitments as well as cost escalations. Additional expenditures incurred by Ministries, not previously programmed and provided for, were coyered through supplementary estimates. These increases in expenditure would not have caused strains on budgetary operations, such as were discernible during the year, had there been a commensurate growth in government revenue and financing resources. Relief from these latter sources was barely forthcoming. The growth of revenue seriously lagged behind the growth of expenditure.",

Further, while GNP (nominal) recorded a growth of 25 per cent over the preceding year, government revenue registered a meagre growth of 8 per cent exhibiting a 1 lack of buoyancy in relation to the growth in money incomes in the economy.\" Recurrent expenditure including net advance accounts payments at Rs. 15,333 million in 1980 showed an increase of Rs. 2,803 million or 22 per cent. However, recurrent expenditure as a share in the GNP was 25 per cent in rg8o as was in 1979. Capital expenditure including sinking fund contributions and debt repayments at. Rs. 13,693 million, was 52 per cent higher than the preceding year's expenditure. The share of capital expenditure in GNP increased from r8 per cent in 1979 to 22 per cent in 1980. With the current account deficit at Rs. 1,577 million and the. capital budget commitment at Rs. 13,693 million, the total budget deficit amounted to Rs. 15,270 million in ig8o, recording an increase of 7r per cent over the approved budget deficit and a 74 per cent increase over the deficit of the previous year. The budget deficit registered in 1980 was 25 per cent of nominal GNP.",

Increased receipts from business turnover taxes were due to an upward revision in the tax rates, the higher level of economic activity and the prevalent inflationary impulses in the economy. As far as tax incidence is concerned, indirect taxes exhibit a higher degree of regressivity. However, the exemption of wage of mass consumption goods like rice, flour and sugar from the business turnover tax somewhat minimised the extent of regressivity. Even with regard to import duties, a measure of tax progressivity has been introduced by levying duty rates in line with end use and the demand pattern relating to commodities.",

Transfers of current funds to semi-government entities were due to varied reasons. There was, firstly, the normal transfer to non-profit oriented semi-government entities to meet current commitments. Secondly, there were transfers of funds due to policy decisions such as the maintenance of certain subsidy schemes, and thirdly there were transfers relating to the reimbursement of losses. The increase in the transfer of current funds was mainly caused by higher payments made to the State Fertilizer Corporation and the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB). The transfer of Rs. 800 million as against last year's payment of Rs. 395 million to the State Fertilizer Corporation was on account of the fertilizer subsidy. In the case of Sri Lanka Transport Board in comparison to last year's payment of Rs. 85 million, during the year a sum of Rs. 457 million was transferred for reimbursement of operational losses. The transfer of Rs. 53 million to the National Milk Board was due to the maintenance of a producer subsidy",

This accounted for nearly a 13 per cent of the total recurrent expenditure in 1980. In the previous year it was 9 per cent. With a net out payment amounting to Rs. 1,525 million, Food Commissioner's food purchase and distribution operations constituted a major part of the expenditure on advance account activities. The balance was accounted by the other advance accounts. Based on tentative data the operations relating to Sri Lanka-China Trade account would have resulted in a net out payment (expenditure) amounting to Rs. 208 million. Increased cost of goods and services and increased activities, losses on advance account activities which were not com\u00adpensated with counterpart voted expenditure and increased loan facilities to state officers necessitated greater recourse to advances. Increased import prices, particularly sugar and wheat flour were primarily responsible for the heavy out payments on Food Commissioner's advance account. Expenditure on Food Commissioner's account also included trading losses and increases in trade debtors. The original budget, however, made allowance for only a sum of Rs. 100 million on all advance account activities. Therefore, for the third successive year, advance account operations continued to be a major element of budgetary disturbance. Previous reports and reviews focussed attention on this problem and emphasised the need to adjust budgetary format so that advance account activities could be explicitly by incorporated in the annual budget.",

With original estimates and the subsequent supple\u00admentaries matched against the total resource mobilization, it has been possible to obtain a tentative estimate on the extent of under-expenditure in the overall capital account. Accordingly, the derived rate of under-expenditure is 15 per cent. Net of sinking fund contributions and debt repayments, the net capital expenditure during the year recorded an increase of 56 per cent. It is pertinent to note in this regard, that capital expenditure data can only quantify the extent to which financial targets of expenditure have been acheived. Data would not correctly reflect the extent to which physical targets have been met. To realize the latter, Performance Budgeting is required. Particularly, in an inflationary context, capital expenditure data have to be deflated in order to ascertain the real increase. Using the implicit GNP deflator it is seen that the increase in total",

In comparison, the deficit in the previous year was Rs. 8,791 million. Resources available from the normal sources of finance did not, however, expand sufficiently to bridge the gap. Accordingly, steps were taken to obtain additional resources both from domestic and foreign sources. Total foreign finance (including commercial borrowings) aggregated Rs. 6,253 million as against the budget estimate of RF. 5,820 million. Non-bank borrowing from the domestic sources was Rs. 2,692 million which was well below the original estimate of Rs. 3,100 million. This critical financial position was further intensified and aggravated in the field of non-market borrowings where the loan operations and the settlement of past commit\u00adments resulted in a net outflow of Rs. 884 million. Thus, the final outturn revealed a resource gap of Rs. 7,210 million. Consequently, the Treasury was faced with a problem of cash management. In order to meet its commitments, the govern\u00adment was compelled to resort to borrowing from the banking system. Total bank financing of the deficit amounted to Rs. 7,077 million, and was supplemented by drawing down the cash balance by Rs. 133 million.",

As a result, the domestic market borrowings from the non-banking domestic sources amounted only to Rs. 2,692 million as against Rs. 2,806 million in the previous year. On the other hand, non-market borrowings resulted in \"negative financing\" of Rs. 884 million. Thus, the resource gap was met by borrowings from the banking sector amounting to Rs. 7,077 million and by use of cash balance to an extent of Rs. 133 million.",

    "text": "The income velocity of both monetary aggregates (i.e. GNP at current factor cost, divided by the monetary aggregate) recorded a marginally declining trend in the past few years. In the case of M t which recorded an average income velocity of 7.1 during the period 1974 to 1977, it declined to 6.8 in 1978 to 6.5 in 1979 and 6.6 in 1980. Similarly, the income velocity of M 2 which stood at an average of 4.6 during the period from 1974 to 1977, declined to 3.7 in 1978, to 3.3 in 1979 and to 3.2 in 1980. The declining trend in the income velocity indicates that the rates of growth in both monetary aggregates had been faster than that in the output of goods and services, thereby exerting pressure on the price level.",
