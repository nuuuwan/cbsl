The corresponding rates of growth for 1978 and 1977 were 4 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively. If the growth rates for 1979 and 1980 are adjusted for population increases, the resulting per capita growth rates are positively disappointing. The production of the tree crop sub-sector decreased reducing the surpluses available for exports. Tea production in 1980 declined by 7 per cent1 while rubber production declined by 13 per cent. Coconut production declined by 15 per cent. It is likely that the production in the minor export crop sub-sector too would have either declined or remained more or less at the level of performance in 1979.",

In 1980 the majority of farmers sold their paddy output to private dealers and theT*addy Marketing Board (PMB)\"~ was able to purchase 211,000 metric tons, only 10 per cent of the total production,.; as against 541,000 metric tons purchased in 1979 which was equivalent to 28 per cent of total production. The increase in the fertilizer subsidy announced in November, 1979 too had the desired effect of promoting fertilizer use enabling higher productivity and yields per acre, There was a 97 per cent increase in the.-; issues of fertilizer for paddy production in 1980.",

In the rubber sub-sector, the increasing senility of trees, due to neglect of replanting over the years and below optimum level of maintenance, combined with the reduced tapping area which is. the result of uprooting for replanting purposes, were factors primarily responsible for the reduced rubber production in 1980.",

Growth impulses were also seen in the fishing sector. The private sector fish production increased in 1980, compensating for the reduced fish production by the public sector. It is estimated that total fish production in 1980 increased by 9 per cent responding to greater availability of fishing gear and other capital equipment made. available at greatly subsidised prices. The operations of the Fisheries Corporation in 1980 were characterised by the higher' emphasis placed on fish purchases. . Purchases increased by 30 per cent above the previous year's level. Fish production by the Corporation on the other' hand, indicated a decrease of 48 per cent, mainly due to an inability of the Corporation's trawlers to fish in the \"Wadge Bank\" area off the south coast of India, due to an expiry of an agreement between the two countries. However, due to a significant increase in fish purchases, the total supply of fish of the Fisheries Corporation indicated an increase of 13 per cent in the year under review.",

The work of the two Corporations were further decentralized by creating regional boards. The JEDB selected regional boards to be at Hatton, Kandy, Badulla and Kegalle while SLSPC sited its regional boards, in Hatton, Nuwara Eliya, Kalutara and Galle, The act of decentralisation did not bring in any immediate improvement in the management of the plantations as the head offices in Colombo were somewhat reluctant to delegate authority.

    "text": "The increasing difficulties encountered by the PMB in purchasing paddy have certain deeper implications. Some of these are of an adverse character. There is, for instance the observable fact of increasing under-utilization of the capital stock of the PMB which deserves serious attention. Most of the PMB rice mills operated only for a few months in 1980, and the situation in all probability would worsen in the years to come. As a participant in the buffer stock scheme of the Food Commissioner (FC), the PMB was faced at times with the problem of supplying adequate quantities of rice to the FC. Apart from the above, given the present low level of purchases and its possible continuance, the supply of rice to the open market through its sales outlets is bound to be greatly restricted in future unless PMB purchases of paddy are increased through aggressive on-the-spot trading or through other appropriate corrective measures.",

There was no improvement in this position in 1980. It deserves re-stressing that one of the quickest and economic ways of achieving short-term increases in agricultural output would be to increase the present allocation of resources for the restoration and proper maintenance of minor irrigation schemes on a priority basis. Such action would also correct the apparent imbalance in the allocation of resources between major and minor irri\u00adgation works.",

The average net (of taxes) Colombo auction price showed a substantial increase of 55 per cent over the average price which prevailed in the previous year. This was largely due to tax reductions effected in mid 1979. However, the average export (f.o.b.) price increased by only 10 per cent. The reduced flow of supply from major producing countries would have contributed to this improvement in export prices. The cost of pro\u00adduction of made tea has been estimated to have increased by 22 per cent. The cost of tea chests, transport and fuel accounted for the bulk of the increase. According to the Sri Lanka Tea Board, the tea industry, as a whole, was able to maintain a positive producer margin as against the negative margin observed in the previous year. The SLSPC and the JEDB recorded positive margins of Rs. 1.42 and Re. 0.95 per kg. of made tea, respectively.",

The export duties on tea in packets and tea bags, which were uniformly applied at Rs. 10.50 per kg., were reduced to Rs. 8.50 and Re. 1.00 per kg. respectively, with effect from ist July, 1980. In order to assist the manufacturers to cope with the increases in the costs of fuel, tea chests, electricity, etc., the amount deductible as manufacturing charges by the factories under the 'Price Support Measure Scheme' was increased from Rs. 4.70 to Rs. 5.40 per kg. with effect from ist October, 1980. To qualify for the subsidy under this scheme, the floor price was increased from Rs. 11 to Rs. 12 per kg. in view of the increasing trend in the auction prices and the need to improve quality of made tea. Another important policy measure adopted in the course of the year was the decision by the Govern\u00adment to allow interested investors to enter into the tea blending industry. Such action would help to diversify exports.",

The production from SLSPC estates showed an increase of approximately 10 per cent and the estate production of JEDB a marginal increase, when compared with the previous year. The share of the state-owned sector in total rubber production increased from 30 per cent in 1979 to 37 per cent in 1980, while the share of total rubber land in tapping, coming within the authority of the JEDB and SLSPC remained at 25 per cent, indicating that the smallholders sector performed poorly in 1980. As in other plantation crops, the economic problems of the smallholder remained the same. The rate of replanting continued to increase in 1980 as in the previous year. An extent of 5,436 hectares were replanted in 1980 with improved varieties indicating an increase of 30 per cent over 1979. The increase in the replanting subsidy announced in the 1979 budget appears to have stimulated replanting. It is also envisaged that with approximately 18,000 hectares earmarked for rehabilitation in the Kalutara, Kegalle and Ratnapura districts with World Bank aid over the next five years, there would be a further increase",

The replanting subsidy at Rs. 5,000 per acre (Rs. 12,350 per hectare) for public sector estates and Rs. 6,500 per acre (Rs. 16,055) per hectare) for private estates and small holders, appears inadequate in view of the current high costs of replanting.

    "text": "The overall producer margin for the industry continued to be positive, though the JEDB and the SLSPC indicated negative margins due to- their higher average costs. The low price of latex crepe, in particular, affected the major estates, engaged in crepe manufacture. As the Crepe-sheet differential moved in favour of sheet production, there was an inducement to switch from crepe to sheet rubber pro\u00adduction. It has been estimated that about 30 per cent of the public sector estates have dual processing facilities. A programme designed for greater installation of dual processing facilities would enable the major estates to switch from one product to the other with minimum disruption. In this regard, it would be useful to examine the possibilities of producing centrifuged latex on government-owned estates. Some JEDB estates have processing facilities and it may be possible to utilise this capacity to increase the availability of centrifuged latex in the country. At present there are local manufacturing concerns using centrifuged latex and with greater availability of the raw material, more firms both local and foreign, may be induced to invest in producing latex based products for export, thereby increasing the value added component of natural rubber based products within the country itself.",

There was accordingly a reversal of the increasing trend in production observed in the last two years, and performance was below levels of production registered in the early seventies when the average exceeded 2,500 million nuts. The decline in production reduced the exportable surplus by about 390 million nuts when compared with 1979, The drought which was experienced irt the country during the latter part of 1979, and in the early part of 1980 has been the main cause for this substantial decline in coconut production.",

Fertilizer issued to the coconut sub-sector in 1980 amounted to 55,800 ' metric tons, indicating a 12 per cent increase over the previous year. The subsidised fertilizer prices in force in 1980 effectively insulated the producers against rising fertilizer import prices. The Coconut Fertilizer Credit Scheme implemented by the two state-owned banks, since the early part of 1979, helped to increase fertilizer use in 1980. -",

    "text": "; :. iThe-reduced supply of nuts resulting from the drought led to a sharp decline in the production of desiccated \u2022 coconut (DC) and coconut oil in 1980. The \u2022production of DG was also affected by the imposition of power cuts. On the other hand, it-appears that one of the reasons for low DC production in the early part of 1980 was the maintenance by the authorities of minimum f.o.b. prices at too high a level which actively discouraged exports. A reduction in the minimum f.o.b. price in the second half of the year led to an increase in production and exports. It is imperative that Sri Lanka maintains a hold on the profitable but .highly competitive world market for DC. . Interference in the production and marketing processes may adversely affect this important.source of foreign exchange earnings. The strict control maintained on the opening of new DC mills in the country during the past has resulted in a decrease in production capacity due to existing old mills going out of commission. There was also some measure of pro\u00adtection given to existing DC.mills by this policy which is not in the.longer term interest of modernization of the industry. However, it is encouraging to note that the Ministry of Coconut Industries has recently entertained applications to open new DC mills. In the case of coconut oil, the virtual ban on exports, which continued to be in existence through most of- the year, coupled with the lower level of nut supply due to the drought led to a marked decline in production.",

The yields too increased considerably from 2,750 kgs. per hectare (53 bushels per acre) in 1979 to 2,927 kgs per hectare (56 bushels per acre) in 1980, largely due to increased fertilizer^jise\u00bb_better cultural practices, more extension servicesand favourable weather conditions.

However, the production of buffalo milk which on the average accounts for about 25 per cent of total milk production in the country increased only by 5 per cent in 1980 when compared with the previous year. The NMB collected 61.8 million litres of milk in 1980, recording a marginal decrease over the last year. The drop in the collection of milk by the NMB was probably due to the industrial disputes which prevailed in the institution and partly to increased competition from the private sector in the sphere of collection.",

The People's' ' Bank, together with rural banks continued to be the major lending institutions to the rural sector in the country by providing Rs. 58.9 million or 58 per cent of all the loans granted in the year. The rural banks which accounted for 30 per cent of the loans granted to the rural sector in 1979 increased their share to 39 per cent in 1980.
