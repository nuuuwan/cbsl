HON. RONNIE de MEL, M. P., MINISTER OF FINANCE AND PLANNING, COLOMBO.

Dear Sir,

In accordance with the provisions of Section 35 (1) of the Monetary Law Act (Cap. 422), I submit herewith the Thirty First Annual Report of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Ceylon.

The report is in four parts. The first is a review of the performance of the Sri Lanka economy in 1980, the problems that were encountered and the policies and measures that were adopted. The second part details the accounts and operations of the Central Bank. Part three gives the major administrative measures adopted by the Monetary Board during 1980; and part four presents the texts and sometimes, extracts of major legislative enactments of 1980 relating to the functions and operations of the Central Bank and banking institutions in Sri Lanka.

Since 1975, a more detailed review of the economic trends and developments in the various sectors of the economy has been published separately under the title "Review of the Economy". The Review for 1980 will be published at an early date.

I am, dear Sir,

Yours faithfully,

WARNASENA RASAPUTRAM Governor.
