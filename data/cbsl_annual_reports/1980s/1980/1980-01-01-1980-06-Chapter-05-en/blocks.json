The question remains, however, whether the same rate of activity could be sustained in view of the resource constraints and the escalating costs of construction, particularly when several other sectors of the economy are pressing for resources. In this context, the basic issue appears to be one of maintaining an appropriate balance between infrastructure expenditures and production oriented investments.",

For example, ths plantation sector recorded a lower growth rate in 1980, while the construction and trade sectors could not sustain the high tempo of activity of the previous two years. The industry sector was probably resorting to more capital intensive techniques of production under the tax incentives offered such as lump sum depreciation granted to promote investments. Further\u00admore, the high rate of growth in employment creation that was observed in the initial period following import and exchange liberalization cannot be expected to prevail year after year, unless the labour absorption capacity of the economy is improved.",
