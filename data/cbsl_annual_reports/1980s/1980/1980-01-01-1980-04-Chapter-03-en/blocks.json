    "text": "Prior to the economic reforms of 1977, industries were heavily protected by rigid import controls, foreign exchange allocations and high tariffs. The availability of tied aid lines was also instrumental in providing an edge to some industries favouring sheltered development. The prolonged continuance of these restrictive measures induced by and large an inward looking industrial sector. These measures proliferated in many instances inefficient industries, discouraged the inflow of foreign capital and large-scale investment in industry. With the removal of barriers to trade while retaining protective tariffs, some entrepreneurs, the major ones in particular, took steps in the period following the reforms of 1977 to sustain their capacity utilization and to upgrade the products so as to improve their competitive strength against the challenge from' imported products. The much improved investment climate also contributed to further rationalise investment activity. Several of these expansionary programmes were supported by foreign collaborators by way of providing capital, technology and management skills.",

The output of yam and cloth of government-owned textile mills as well as private milk was curtailed substantially during the year on account of marketing problems. A wide range of fashionable fabrics was imported from countries internationally reputed for high quality. The point is stressed that most of the imported textile fabrics are produced under highly efficient conditions employing automated machinery such as air-jet looms, water-jet looms and rapier looms. In comparison and in vivid contrast, outdated machines with poor layout and limited versatility are used in most textile mills in this country. Only limited varieties of fabrics and finished products are pro\u00adducible given the outdated and restricted character of the machinery with resultant higher costs of production for inferior products. Further, in spite of higher prices traders were able to sell imported textile materials because of customer preferences for quality. Besides, sales of imported textiles were kept buoyant through misuse of facilities such as the gift parcel scheme which was in operation and the free baggage allowance to incoming passengers. In view of these factors, the local producers",

A significant policy decision adopted during the year was the establishment of a Presidential Tariff Commission to rationalise the tariff structure to protect the local industries while safeguarding the interests of the consumer. Under the present tariff structure, in general, finished products are subject to a higher level of duties than the raw material inputs. This is a conscious policy to further value added activity locally. However, anomalies exist in the case of tariffs pertaining to . certain products. For instance, certain pharmaceutical products are allowed to be imported at lower duty rates whereas the raw materials and packing materials required to produce the very same drugs are subject to higher import duties. Another example is the import of certain electrical accessories where the finished product has an edge over domestic production. Such anomalies would have to be corrected to permit an element of fair competition. The Commission is expected to work out a more meaningful tariff policy based on the framework of effective tariff protection.",

Such enterprises included those producing handloom textiles, hand-made paper, chemicals, soaps, paints and fabricated metal products. Considering the problems confronted by these industries on the one hand and advantages flowing from such enterprises through the use of indigenous raw materials and generation of employment on the other, a re-examination of the present tariff structure in terms of levels of effective tariff protection required for those industries appears to be a matter of some urgency. However, one fact needs to be stressed. Although much has been said about the plight of this sector in general and the adverse effect on employment and total supplies, if the non competitive industries are allowed to go out of production, their continuance should be on economic and not on welfare grounds. Neither the Government nor the consumer should be called upon to meet the cost of subsidising these non-competitive and inefficient industries. From a longer term perspective, the redeployment of the factors employed in these industries would be wholly beneficial.",

The experience in 1980 is no different. In 1980, the output of refined petroleum products accounted for about 45 per cent of the overall industrial production and the share of garments was approximately 8 per cent. Thus, these two industries together con\u00adtributed about one-half of the total industrial production. As a result, the tempo of overall industrial production is cloiely tied to the economic fortunes of these two industries and could remain so until such time as a more diversified and developed industrial structure is evolved. Special reference should be made to the garment industry. This industry is likely to reach saturation point in the near future re\u00adversing the buoyant performance of the recent past on account of quota restrictions",

    "text": "imposed by several importing countries, particularly the US and the European Economic Community (EEC). Quota restrictions against garment exports from Sri Lanka imposed by the EEC countries, Norway, Sweden and Canada have been in force since 1978. The United States, a major buyer of garment exports from Sri Lanka, imposed quota restrictions with effect from 1st May, 1980. The current US quota, valid for a period of seven years, sets out specific limits and sub-limits against the volume of exports for seven' categories of garment products of Sri Lanka. All these considerations point to an urgent need to diversify the industrial base in the economy. This could be achieved largely by developing agro-based industries. The bulk of the rubber production at present is exported in a partially processed form and there is potential to expand the production of rubber goods such as rubberised coir products, rubber components for automobile industries and' rubber floor tiles. The same applies to a wide range of agricultural raw materials currently exported from Sri Lanka. Industries based on coconut products can be developed to produce upgraded coir yarn, coir carpets, other manufactures using coir such as brooms, brushes, etc., glycerine, fatty acids, coco-chemicals and coconut cream. Minor agricultural products such as rice bran, gingelly, ground nut, nutmeg, cinnamon and citronella could be utilized to produce essential oils and drugs.",

The annual production capacity of the Prima Complex at China Bay, Trincomalee is 600 thousand metric tons sufficient to meet in full total domestic requirements with sufficient capacity for contingencies. The Urea Fertilizer Plant at Sapugaskanda managed by the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation is expected to produce 217 thousand metric tons of urea in 1981 and 310 thousand metric tons of urea per year from 1982 onwards. The Petroleum Corporation would be providing the raw material for the fertilizer plant from its refinery at Sapugaskanda. It is expected that the excess urea production over domestic needs would be exported.",

    "text": "The considerable decline of current transfer payments from the Government to industrial enterprises during the year was a noteworthy development. In line with the Government decision to turn public sector enterprises into commercially viable ventures, these organizations endeavoured to operate within budgetary allocations. The financial discipline and improved position of several of the enter, prises resulted in a decrease in the transfers required from the Government for current expenditure purposes from Rs. 210 million in 1979 to Rs. 82 million in 1980. However, total transfers rose from Rs. 249 million in 1979 to Rs 968 million in 1980 as a result of a considerable increase in capital transfers. The total amount of capital transfers increased from Rs. 39 million in 1979 toRs. 886millionin 1980. Substantial capital transfers were granted to State Fertilizer Manufacturing (Urea Plant), National Paper (Embilipitiya Paper Factory) and Sugar (Sevanagala Sugar Project) Corporations. These figures are summarised , in Table 1.17. Capital transfers required by public sector enterprises are likely to decline in the future since they are expected to mobilize their own capital resources for new projects.",

Of these, 64 firms have signed agreements with the GCEC to set up various industries. Among them, 23 firms, majority in garment manufacturing, were in commercial production in the Investment Promotion Zone (IPZ) at Katunayake by the end of the year. In addition, 5 firms were in trial production. The factories in the IPZ provided employment for 10,581 persons. Gross earnings from the IPZ exports amounted to Rs. 505 million (SDR 22 million) during 1980 and garment exports accounted for 93 percent of these earnings. Comparative data on employment and gross earnings classified by type of industries are given in Table below. The pro\u00adjects approved by the Commission during the year included new types of industries such as those producing electronic devices, electrical parts, cargo containers, machinery equipment and irrigation pumps. Investment seminars, media publicity and media interviews were widely used at international levels to attract foreign investors.",
