The major factor responsible for the adverse trade position in 1980 was a sharp increase in the value of imports which amounted to Rs- 33,637 million (SDR 1,563 million) indicating an increase of Rs. 11,077 million or 49 per cent (39 per cent in SDR terms). In contrast export earnings increased only by 13 per cent (6 per cent in SDR terms) to Rs. 17,273 million (SDR 803 million). When Customs data are adjusted for the imports and exports by certain government agencies which get recorded after a time lag the trade deficit in 1980 amounted to Rs. 15,561 million.
