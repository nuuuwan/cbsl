    "text": "The Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC),one of the lead projects of the present government, has approved 137 projects by the end of the year. Of these, 64 firms have signed agreements with the GCEC to set up various industries. Among them, 23 firms, majority in garment manufacturing, were in commercial production in the Investment Promotion Zone (IPZ) at Katunayake by the end of the year. In addition, 5 firms were in trial production. The factories in the IPZ provided employment for 10,581 persons. Gross earnings from the IPZ exports amounted to Rs. 505 million (SDR 22 million) during 1980 and garment exports accounted for 93 percent of these earnings. Comparative data on employment and gross earnings classified by type of industries are given in Table below. The pro\u00adjects approved by the Commission during the year included new types of industries such as those producing electronic devices, electrical parts, cargo containers, machinery equipment and irrigation pumps. Investment seminars, media publicity and media interviews were widely used at international levels to attract foreign investors.",

Meanwhile, the lack of rain in the catchment areas affected adversely hydro-power generation. As a result of the unsatisfactory power generation position 'power cuts' had to be imposed to ration the limited availability of electricity. The energy outlook for the next several years would be rather bleak if the same trends continue to prevail. The supplementation of hydro-power through gas turbines is a costly way ot overcoming the present problem.

At end 1980 the price of gasoline stood at Rs. 8.79 per litre, compared with Rs. 6.60 at the end of 1979, revealing a sale price increase of 33 per cent. The pricing formula of the CPC based on a cross-subsidization policy was modified to' a great extent, to reflect the true costs of products such as diesel and' kerosene. The price of kerosene was revised from Rs. 2.35 per litre in 1979. to Rs. 3,34 per litre at the end of 1980. The corresponding figures with respect to auto'diesel price were Rs. 2.30 and Rs. 4.62, respectively. Although the price adjustments appeared to have had some effect on the level as well as the pattern of consumption of different petroleum products, the overall demand was conditioned more by the tempo of activity in the transport, commercial and industrial sectors:.",

    "text": "The relatively low rate of growth in employment in 1980 could be mainly attributable to the general reduction in the labour absorptive capacity of the key sectors of the economy. For example, ths plantation sector recorded a lower growth rate in 1980, while the construction and trade sectors could not sustain the high tempo of activity of the previous two years. The industry sector was probably resorting to more capital intensive techniques of production under the tax incentives offered such as lump sum depreciation granted to promote investments. Further\u00admore, the high rate of growth in employment creation that was observed in the initial period following import and exchange liberalization cannot be expected to prevail year after year, unless the labour absorption capacity of the economy is improved.",
