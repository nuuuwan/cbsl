    "text": "During the last decade the primary aim of the refinance scheme under the MLCF was to encourage commercial banks and credit institutions to cater to the medium and long term credit needs of the agricultural and industrial sectors in the economy. In the latter half of 1979 a major revision of the scheme was under\u00adtaken by the Central Bank in order to direct resources into priority sectors of the economy. This re-direction of resources was achieved by varying the amount of refinance, the rate of refinance and other terms and conditions to take account of the special needs and problems of the various sectors. The scope of the refinance scheme was further enlarged in 1980 to enable commercial banks and credit insti\u00adtutions to participate more fully in the development of export oriented industries. The Central Bank, in association with the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (SLEDB) introduced a credit scheme under which, an industry designated by the SLEDB as an export oriented industry qualifies for concessional financing frorrf any commercial bank or credit institution operating in the country. -Loans granted under this scheme are eligible to receive refinance from the MLCF to the extent of 80 per cent at a refinance rate of 10 per cent. On-lending rate under this scheme was fixed at 13 per cent.",
