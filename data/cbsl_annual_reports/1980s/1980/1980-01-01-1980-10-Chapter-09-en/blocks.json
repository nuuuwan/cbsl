Indeed, it is through such deficits that foreign resources are absorbed into the economy. In this sense, the deficits recorded in 1978 and 1979 could not be considered as adverse. In fact, during these years the country was able to mobilise external resources which were more than sufficient to finance the current account deficit, the balance contributing to swell the external assets. On the other hand, the balance of payments develop\u00adments in 1980 were such that the resources mobilised from external sources were sufficient to finance only a portion of the current account deficit, leavings substantial balance to be financed by running down accumulated reserves and subjecting the country to a weakened foreign exchange situation.",

    "text": "The services sector of the balance of payments continued to show expansion, the total receipts rising from Rs. 2,993 million (SDR 148 million) in 1979 to Rs. 4,605 million (SDR 214 million) in 1980. But owing to higher payments mainly on account of interest and service charges on loans, IMF drawings and other short term borrowings, the net surplus increased marginally from Rs. 740 million (SDR 36 million) in 1979 to Rs. 861 million (SDR 40 million) in 1980. Net receipts from transfers, especially from private transfers, consisting mainly of remittances from Sri Lankan residents employed abroad, continued to increase, a phenomenon observed since 1976, and helped to increase the surplus on private and official transfers to Rs. 4,540 million (SDR 211 million) in 1980. The quantum of net receipts from private transfers in this total rose substantially from Rs. 754 million (SDR 37 million) in 1979 to Rs. 2,260 million (SDR 105 million) in 1980, recording an increase of 184 per cent. The net surplus recorded in the services sector and on private and official transfers helped to reduce the current account balance to Rs. i0,739million (SDR 499 million).",

A more meaningful yardstick to assess the volume would be the number of visitor nights. The number of nights spent by the tourists during the year 1980 amounted to 3.5 million reflecting an annual growth of almost 27 per cent. It appears that the tourist nights have increased at a lower rate than the arrivals of the tourists. The average duration of stay of a tourist which had improved from 9.8 nights in 1975 to 11.1 nights in 1979 appears to have declined marginally to 11 nights in 1980.",
