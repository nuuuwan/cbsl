The Bonds will be issued by the Department of Banking of the Central Bank of Ceylon or by the Head Office or any Branch Office of any of the commercial banks in Sri Lanka.

(iv) Place of Repayment

The face value of the Bond will be repayable on maturity at the Depart­ment of Banking, Central Bank of Ceylon, or at the Head Office or Branch Office of any of the commercial banks in Sri Lanka.

(v) Interest

(a) Interest on the face value of the Bond calculated at 6 per cent per annum is payable half-yearly on the dates specified on the interest coupons attached to each Bond.

137

(b) Interest payable shall be computed on a pro-rata basis for the number of days from the date of issue of the Bond to the due date of interest payment, both days inclusive.

(c) Interest will be paid on the surrender of the coupon at the Depart­ment of Banking, Central Bank of Ceylon, or at the Head Office or Branch Office of any of the commercial banks; the Bond itself need not be presented at the time of encashment of the coupon.

(«") Interest will cease to accrue after the date of maturity.

The interest due dates are printed on each coupon. The Bond bears the facsimile signature of the Governor of the Central Bank of Ceylon and the signatures of the two officers mentioned thereon.

Commercial Banks operating in Sri Lanka are requested to sell Bearer Bonds, acting as Agents for the Central Bank of Ceylon.

For this purpose a requisition as in the annexure signed by one or more authorised officers of the commercial bank in accordance with each bank's own procedures should be sent to the Chief Accountant, Central Bank of Ceylon, Colombo i. Since the Bonds have to be signed b> two officers of the Central Bank to give the Bonds validity prior to isrue, it would be appreciated if the Central Bank is given reasonable notice of the bank's requirements.

Commercial banks should report to the Chief Accountant, Central Bank of Ceylon, their sale of Bearer Bonds on the ist and 16th of each month. When reporting the sale of Bonds, the commercial banks should forward a cheque drawn in favour of the "Central Bank - Bearer Bond Account" together with a statement indicating the serial numbers of the Bonds sold.

The commercial banks are required to insert the date of sale on the face of each Bond and on the reverse of the first coupon for which interest begins to accrue and to duly certify by one or more authorised officers in accordance with each bank's own procedures. Care should be exercised by the commercial bank selling the Bond to invalidate by use of an appropriate stamp those coupons that are not eligible for payment of interest; such coupons should be detached from the Bond and returned to the Chief Accountant, Central Bank of Ceylon, along with the fortnightly returns referred to above, indicating the serial number of the Bond and the invalidated interest coupon number.

When interest is paid on a coupon, the paying banks should endorse across the coupon the legend "interest paid"and submit the coupon to the Chief Accountant, Central Bank of Ceylon, Colombo, for reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be

138

granted promptly by crediting the respective bank's current account held with the Central Bank of Ceylon. The claim for reimbursement should indicate:-—

(a) the serial numbers of the Bonds on which interest has been paid;

(6) the numbers of the interest coupons viz. whether coupon No. i or No. a or No. 3 etc., and

(c) the amount of interest paid on each coupon.

Claims for reimbursement of the payment made on encashment of Bonds should be accompanied by the following:-

(a) the Bonds duly cancelled; and

(b) a statement indicating the serial numbers of the Bonds encashed and the date of encashment of the Bonds.

The Bearer Bonds and the interest coupons attached thereon issued to commercial banks shall remain the property of the Central Bank of Ceylon until sale. Any loss of Bonds from the custody of commercial banks shall be deemed as sold.

Commercial banks and their branches are authorised to encash Bonds and make payment on interest coupons without any inquiries as to when relevant Bonds were purchased.
