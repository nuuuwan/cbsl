This growth rate, estimated on the basis of a New Series of National Accounts* (1982 based), is the same as the growth rate obtained on the basis of the old series (1970 based). The marginal reduction in the growth rate in 1983, compared with the 5.1 per cent growth rate in 1982, is largely due to lower production in the plantation agricultural sector (tea and coconuts) and due to a set back in industrial production, trade and services due to the July disturbances. The decline in tea and coconut production, owing to adverse climatic conditions, among other factors, was more than offset by increased paddy production. The effect of the disturbances has neither been long lasting nor significant, except in the service sectors, which are dependent on tourism.",

    "text": "Tea production in 1983, provisionally estimated at 179.3 million kgs., was the lowest recorded since 1956 and indicated a decline of 8.5 million kgs. or 4.5 per cent when compared with 1982. The fall in production was evident in. all three elevational categories with low grown areas showing the lowest decline of 1.4 milhon kgs. (2.2' per cent). Production in high grown and medium grown areas fell by 3.9 million kgs. (5.4 per cent) and 3.2 milhon kgs. (6.2 per cent), respectively. Accor\u00adding to the Tea Board, production (excluding production from bought leaf) on the .estates owned by the Janatha Estates Development Boards (JEDBs), fell by 5.6 million kgs. (8.2 per cent) while that of the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporations (SLSPCs) fell by 4.3 million kgs. (7.5 per cent) when compared with the production in 1982. Tea production from bought leaf by the JEDBs and the SLSPCs fell by 0.6 ' million kgs. (9.7 per cent) and 1.6 milhon kgs. (12.4 per cent), respectively. However, tea production from bought leaf and own leaf on private sector estates increased by 2.8 milhon kgs. and 0.3 milhon kgs, respectively. Thus, a noteworthy feature of the production dechne was that it was confined to the major state sector corporations, the JEDBs and the SLSPCs. A salient feature of the production decline was that it occurred almost entirely in the second quarter of the year. The fall in total production was mainly due to the combined effect of the severe drought conditions which prevailed throughout the first half of the year and the resultant decrease in fertilizer application during this period. Perhaps, private sector producers have resorted to coarse plucking to take advantage of more attractive prices during the year. This may be particularly true of smallholders.",
