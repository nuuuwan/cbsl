GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

Overall Trends

In 1983 Sri Lanka's economy grew by 4.9 per cent in real terms. This growth rate, estimated on the basis of a New Series of National Accounts* (1982 based), is the same as the growth rate obtained on the basis of the old series (1970 based). The marginal reduction in the growth rate in 1983, compared with the 5.1 per cent growth rate in 1982, is largely due to lower production in the plantation agricultural sector (tea and coconuts) and due to a set back in industrial production, trade and services due to the July disturbances. The decline in tea and coconut production, owing to adverse climatic conditions, among other factors, was more than offset by increased paddy production. The effect of the disturbances has neither been long lasting nor significant, except in the service sectors, which are dependent on tourism.

Sri Lanka's Gross National Product (GNP) at current factor cost prices is esti­mated at Rs. 109 billion in 1983. This is an increase of 20.6 per cent over the previous year. When adjusted for the real increase in GNP, the implicit G N P deflator for 1983 has increased by 16 per cent. The improvement of prices of agricultural exports, "particularly of tea, largely influenced the high rate of increase of the deflator.

In 1983, the international terms of trade turned favourable to the Sri Lanka

economy. The real national income, which is estimated after adjusting for the

terms of trade effect, has increased by 5.7 per cent in 1983 over the previous year.

The gains from tea exports have been very significant. It was unfortunate that

Sri Lanka could not derive the full benefit of rising tea prices because tea production

failed to expand due both to poor weather conditions and structural problems faced

by the tea industry.

According to data made available by the Registrar General's Department,

Sri Lanka's population has increased by 1.5 per cent in 1983. The mid-year popu­

lation in 1983 is 15.416 million compared with 15.189 in 1982. The per capita GNP

at current prices in 1983 has been estimated at Rs. 7,071 (US $ 301). In real terms,

the per capita income of 1983 shows an increase of 2.5 per cent over the previous

year.

In 1983, a 4.9 per cent real growth rate in GDP was realized largely due to the

improved performance of the domestic agricultural sector, whose value added

contribution in real terms increased by 9.4 per cent. On the other hand, the plantation

agricultural sector as a whole declined by 4.9 per cent in 1983. The increase in rubber

production was insufficient to compensate for the major losses in output in the

tea and coconut sub-sectors. The poor performance of plantation agriculture had

a depressing effect on agro-processing, whose value added declined by 4.6 per cent.

Sectoral Performance

The growth rates in various sectors for the period 1982-1983 are given in Table

1.7. The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector has grown by 5.1 per cent in 1983

over the previous year. This appreciably highgrowth rate in the agricultural sector

in 1983 is largely a result of the 14.7 per cent increase in the volume of paddy produc­

tion. The large scale increases in paddy output in some districts have more than

compensated for the decline in production in the drought affected districts. The

increase in rubber production by 8.2 per cent in 1983 was in contrast to the stagnation

observed for the previous three years. Production of tea and coconut continued to

decline in 1983. In the case of tea, there has been a 4.5 per cent decline in production,

while in coconut a larger decline of 8.2 per cent has been reported. A growth rate

of 5.7 per cent has been observed in the fishing sector in 1983 compared with 2.9

per cent in 1982.

Value added in agro-processing industries of tea, rubber and coconut declined

by 4.6 per cent in 1983, as against the 5.3 per cent decline in the previous year. Value

added in factory industries increased only by 2 per cent in 1983 compared with 8.9 per

cent in the previous year. This is the net result of a 15 per cent decline in production

in the state owned industries and a 26 per cent increase in the private sector industries.

In the small industries subsector, a 4.1 per cent growth rate has been observed in

1983, compared with the 10.1 per cent growth rate in 1982. The manufacturing sector

as a whole increased marginally, by 0.8 per cent in 1983, compared with the 4.8

per cent expansion in 1982.

In the construction sector, there has been only a marginal growth of 1 per cent in 1983. The building construction activities of the private sector seem to have declined in 1983 for the third year running. The number of building plans approved by the Colombo Municipal Council has declined by about 21 per cent. However, the construction activities of the Mahaveli Development Programme continued at a high level compensating for the decline in construction activities in the private sector. The decline in construction activities in the Maduru Oya Project has been offset by new construction activities in the Randenigala Project.

Value added in electricity, gas, water and sanitary services increased by 6.6

per cent in 1983. Electricity generation in 1983 increased by only about 2.3 per cent

over the previous year. However, the production of gas products increased by

about 20 per cent.

In the transport, storage and communication sector, there has been a 4.5

per cent expansion in 1983, compared with the 6.2 per cent expansion in the

previous year. The slower growth in imports has been primarily reasponsible

for this slow growth rate.

"Value added in the wholesale and retail trade sector increased by 5.3 percent

in 1983, against the 6 per cent growth in 1982. Here too, the value added contribution

from import based trade increased much less than in the previous year.

The banking, insurance and real estate sector grew by 21.4 per cent as against

the 11.9 per cent increase in 1982. Value added in ownership of dwellings increased

by 2.3 per cent compared with the 5.5 per cent increase in 1982.

In public administration and defence, a large increase in value added has taken

place in 1983. The other services sector suffered a marginal decline in 1983 compared

with the 7 per cent growth rate in 1982, largely because of the decline in the tourist

sub-sector. The total number of tourist arrivals declined by 17.2 per cent in 1983

over the previous year.

An analysis of the sectoral performance clearly indicates that Sri Lanka's

economy's real output levels are below its potential. This is so in state owned

plantation agriculture particularly in tea, and in public corporations where overall

production declined by about 15 per cent. Corrective measures in these sectors

could greatly enhance the production potential of the economy to achieve a

higher real growth rate.

Expenditure Pattern

Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) at current prices is estimated at Rs. 140.8

billion, an increase of Rs. 22 billion over the previous year. Total consumption

expenditure amounted to Rs. 105.7 billion, an increase of about 20 per cent over the

previous year. Private consumption amounted to Rs. 95.5 billion, which represents

about a 19 per cent increase over the previous year. Government consumption has

increased by about 23 per cent over the previous year.

Expenditure on gross domestic capital formation has been Rs. 35 billion, an

increase of Rs. 4.4 billion, or 15 per cent over the previous year. Capital formation

in the private sector and public corporations increased by 16 per cent while

government sector capital formation increased by 7 per cent.

The total value of capital goods imported decreased by 1.2 per cent in 1983

compared with the 48 per cent increase in 1982. Further, the import value of major

capital goods in 1983 decreased by 27.5 per cent as against the 156 per cent increase

in 1982. The import of major capital goods such as ships, aircrafts and railway

locomotives declined in 1983. However, imports of buses and coaches, lorries and

vans, tractors and generators increased.

The largest share of capital formation took place in the form of construction, followed by purchase of plant and machinery. Capital formation in building and construction at current prices', increased by 34 per cent in 1983. The value of cons­truction work in the Mahaweli Development Programme has been estimated at

Rs. 7.1 billion. Capital formation in plant, machinery and equipment increased by 21 per cent in 1983 over the previous year.

Capital formation due to land development and replanting increased by about 10 per cent in value terms. This increase is due to cost escalations in land develop­ment and replanting. The areas replanted in tea, rubber as well as of coconut declined. In tea, only 1,367 hectares were replanted in 1983 as against 2,004 in 1982. In rubber, 5,119 hectares were replanted in 1983. This is 13 per cent less than the replanted areas in the previous year. The coconut land area developed during 1983 is 6,363 hectares, a reduction of 32 per cent compared with the land area developed in the previous year. .

The import content in Gross Domestic Capital Formation declined appreciably from 36.3 percent in 1982 to 30.9 percent in 1983. The ci.f. value of imported capital goods, which was Rs. 11 billion in 1982, declined by one per cent-to reach

Rs, 10,9 bjllion in 1983. However, net of aircrafts, Helicopters, ships and trawlers.

( 6 )

the imports of capital goods increased by 22 per cent from Rs. 7.6 billion in 1982 to Rs. 9.3 billion in 1983. As noted earlier, the import of high value capital goods declined in 1983.

Availability and Utilization of Resources

In 1983, the Sri Lanka economy had a total of Rs. 172.6 billion worth of resources at current market prices. While Rs. 122.3 billion of these came from domestic pro­duction, the remaining Rs. 50.3 billion came through imports. In the utilization of resources Rs. 105.7 billion was spent on consumption compared with the Rs. 88.3 billion in the previous year. Resources worth Rs. 35.2 billion was spent on gross domestic fixed capital formation compared with the Rs. 30.4 billion in 1982. This represents an increase of 16.0 per cent in gross domestic fixed capital formation over the previous year.

Total resources valued at 1978 constant prices, increased by 3.9 percent in 1983. The inflow of imports increased by 1.8 per cent in 1983 compared with an increase of 2.1 per cent in 1982. Total consumption in real terms increased by 6 per cent in 1983 while gross domestic fixed capital formation increased by 1.5 per cent. The government sector capital formation in real terms dechned by 2.5 per cent, while the capital formation in the private sector and public corporations has increased by 2.8 per cent.

Domestic savings, excluding net foreign factor income and private remittances are estimated at Rs. 16.6 billion. This represents a 40 per cent increase in domestic savings. The domestic savings ratio to GDP at market prices, improved from 11.8 per cent in 1982 to 13.6 per cent in 1983. Total national savings, which included net foreign factor income and private transfers, amounted to Rs. 19.8 bilhon, an increase of about 29 per cent, over the previous year. The national savings ratio in 1983, improved to 16.2 per cent compared with the 15.3 per cent in 1982.

TECHNICAL NOTE

New Series of National Accounts

The Central Bank of Ceylon launched a comprehensive revision of national accounts computations in 1983 to accommodate the structural changes in the Sri Lanka economy effected by domestic and international economic changes. The results of the first stage of this exercise which relat to : (i) Agriculture, (ii) Agro-Processing, (iii) Fishing, (iv) Mining and Quarrying, (v) Electricity, Gas, Water and Sanitary Services, (vi) Ownership of Dwelhngs, and (vii) Public Ad­ministration are presented with this Annual Report.

The constant value series of the new national accounts is 1982 based. The 1982 base year was selected for two main reasons. First, the major structural adjustments in the economy which had been activated by new economic policies of the post 1977 period had stabilized by 1982.

Second, a number of comprehensive data collection programmes have been implemented in or around 1982. In 1981/82, the Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey of the Central Bank of Ceylon was conducted. Moreover, in 1981 a national census of population and housing was undertaken. The main areas revised in the new series are as follows.

(1) Agriculture

The latest consumption and cost data have been used in respect of tea, coconut, other agricultural commodities, fruits and vegetables in the computation of value added. (2) Agro-Processing

Latest cost data have been used in value added computations. (3) Fishing

Value added in fish production was updated to include the latest cost data on fish production. (4) Mining and Quarrying

The basis of value added computations was updated to reflect the structural changes in this sector, particularly to include the changes in the use of building ma­terials and the expansion in quarrying due to large construction programmes such as Mahaweli.

( 9 )

(5) Electricity, Gas, Water and Sanitary Services

The basis of value added computations in this sector was updated using more recent cost and production data.

(6) Ownership of Dwellings

The data of the national census of population and housing were used along with the Consumer Finances data to update the value added in ownership of dwellings.

(7) Public Administration and. Defence _ Changes that had taken place in public administration were incorporated into the value added computations.

Table A. 1 gives a comparison of value added in the new series and old series.

Tea ,

Tea production in 1983, provisionally estimated at 179.3 million kgs., was the lowest recorded since 1956 and indicated a decline of 8.5 million kgs. or 4.5 per cent when compared with 1982. The fall in production was evident in. all three elevational categories with low grown areas showing the lowest decline of 1.4 milhon kgs. (2.2' per cent). Production in high grown and medium grown areas fell by 3.9 million kgs. (5.4 per cent) and 3.2 milhon kgs. (6.2 per cent), respectively. Accor­ding to the Tea Board, production (excluding production from bought leaf) on the .estates owned by the Janatha Estates Development Boards (JEDBs), fell by 5.6 million kgs. (8.2 per cent) while that of the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporations (SLSPCs) fell by 4.3 million kgs. (7.5 per cent) when compared with the production in 1982. Tea production from bought leaf by the JEDBs and the SLSPCs fell by 0.6 ' million kgs. (9.7 per cent) and 1.6 milhon kgs. (12.4 per cent), respectively. However, tea production from bought leaf and own leaf on private sector estates increased by 2.8 milhon kgs. and 0.3 milhon kgs, respectively. Thus, a noteworthy feature of the production dechne was that it was confined to the major state sector corporations, the JEDBs and the SLSPCs. A salient feature of the production decline was that it occurred almost entirely in the second quarter of the year. The fall in total production was mainly due to the combined effect of the severe drought conditions which prevailed throughout the first half of the year and the resultant decrease in fertilizer application during this period. Perhaps, private sector producers have resorted to coarse plucking to take advantage of more attractive prices during the year. This may be particularly true of smallholders.
