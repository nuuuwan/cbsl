    "text": "In spite of this background 1983 saw a sharp drop in the oil import bill both in terms of SDRs and SL rupees reversing the increasing trend observed since the first oil price shock in 1973. This relieved the growing burden of energy imports on the country's balance of payments. Petroleum which accounted for 66 per cent of the commercial energy supply of the country, absorbed 24 per cent of the total import bill in. 1983when compared.with 29 per cent in 1982. The reduced burden on the country's balance of payments is evident as the oil import bill taken as a percentage of the value of non-petroleum exports decreased to 49 per cent in the current year from its unprecedented 67 per cent in 1982.",

    "text": "The reduced oil import bill was a reflection mainly of the reduced volume of imports and the decrease in prices in the international market. The volume of imports declined from 2.2 million metric tons in 1982 to 2.0 milhon metric tons in 1983. Prices of crude oil dropped by 11 per cent whereasthose of refined products decreased by 18 per cent. In the year under review, earnings from exports of petroleum products declined by 24 per cent in SDR terms when compared with the previous year. The drop in petroleum export earnings can be attributed to the decrease in the production of exportable oil products. Owing to the closure of the refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) for maintenance for eight weeks in the first half of 1983, imports of refined products in quantity terms rose sharply and were 80 per cent higher than the volume of such imports in the previous year.",

However, the Kerosene Stamp Scheme, which was designed to subsidize the fuel cost of low income groups continued. Losses incurred by the CPC'on account of the-kerosene subsidy amounting to Rs. 141 milhon were met by the Treasury. A notable trend in energy.conservation was observed with the drop in kerosene consumption (9 per cent) in 1983 when prices were brought closer to actual cost than at any time in the past. Despite price increases ranging from 10 per cent to 40 per cent the consumption of other bulk petroleum products rose from the 1982 level. ? Reflecting the growing dependence on oil products in electricity generation, the consumption of heavy diesel in 1983 was twice as much as its consumption last year. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) accounted for 88 per cent of the 285,509 metric tons of the heavy diesel consumed in the year under review.",

Of this capacity, 190 mW represent thermal power. The supply of hydro power dropped by 24 per cent due to the adverse weather conditions that prevailed in catchment areas during the first eight months of the year. The increase of 96 per cent registered with respect to thermal power resulted from CEB resorting to generate more thermal power with a view to meeting the growing demand for power in the face of a declining hydro power supply. Economy in the use of the available water in the reservoirs-was practised in order to maintain a balance in the generating capacity throughout the period. The use of oil for generating electricity was an expensive alternative both from the point of the CEB and the consumer.",

Further, with the view to conserving available water in the reservoirs, the CEB imposed an island-wide power cut for two hours a day in the latter part of 1983.

In a situation of growing competition from the private sector in both passenger and freight markets, public sector agencies were compelled to adopt a more positive approach to improving efficiency and productivity. Certain steps have been taken by the RTBs by way of re-routing, re-scheduling, and curtailment of certain uneconomical services in this regard. As these measures were intensified close on the heels of the upward revision of fuel charges and consequent revision of prices, it is premature to judge their effectiveness in containing rising operating costs. The drop in the supply of transport services of the public sector in 1983 was partly due to the restricted operations during July and August and the curtailment of certain services, mainly in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.",

Work on a further 1,523 units was in progress during the year compared with 2,713 units in 1982.. Expenditure on the Direct Construction Sub-Programme totalled Rs. 392 million in 1983 compared with Rs. 660 million in the previous year. As in 1982, the Direct Construction Sub-Programme accounted for the largest proportion (74 per cent) of the total financial resources utilized by the PSHP in 1983. In fact it accounted for as much as 67 per cent of the total cumulative expenditure since 1978. As far as targets are concerned Direct Construction type housing has had a rather disappointing record. Between 1978 and 1983, only 30 per cent of the targetted number of units were completed using up nearly 70 per cent of the allocated expenditure. Considering the cost-overruns and escalations associated with this type of construction activity which is dependent heavily on imported materials and given the budgetary constraints it was inevitable that this sub-programme would be pruned down. It was in the Rural Housing Sub-Programme (consisting of Aided Self Help, Model Villages and Fisheries Houses) that the most cost efficient methods of construction within the PSHP were adopted. In 1983, 7,386 units were completed under the sub-programme compared with 4,492 units in 1982. A further 6,254 units were under construction in 1983. Total expenditure incurred during the current year was Rs. 113 milhon compared with Rs. 114 milhon in 1982. The Rural Housing Programme with its emphasis on the use of indigenous materials accounted for only 21 per cent of the total financial resources utilized by the PSHP in 1983. It accounted for only 13 per cent of the total cumulative expen\u00additure of the PSHP since 1978. The Rural Housing Programme has been the most successful in terms of physical progress and cost control and has achieved 53 per cent of its targetted number of units spending 80 per cent of its allotted resources.",

In the year under review 2,960 units were comple\u00adted compared with 1,140 units in 1982. Work on a further 290 units was in progress in 1983. Expenditure on this sub-program amounted to Rs. 19 million in 1983 compared with Rs. 72 million in 1982. Electoral housing units accounted for only 4 per cent of the expenditure incurred on the PSHP in 1983. However, it accounted for 12 per cent of the total cumulative expenditure of the PSHP between 1978-1983. Only 40 per cent of the targetted number of units were completed using up 78 per cent of the allocated expenditure. There were 24 units of Public Servant Quarters under construction by the end of the year.

Building approvals by the CMC suggest a low. level of activity when compared with 1982. In 1983 ,there were a total of 986 building approvals compared with 1245 in 1982 registering' a decline of 21 per cent. From these figures it could be surmised that due to the shortage and therefore high cost of land in the Colombo City Limits there has been a shift to suburban areas especially in the case of industrial and commercial buildings. ^The high cost of building materials, labour and finance have contributed to-the stifling of private sector housing and construction.",

The programme in Hambantota is much more flexible in that there is room for the inclusion of sub-projects in consultation with the donor agency depending on the priorities and capa\u00adcity to implement such additions. The programmes in Matara and Nuwara Eliya are implemented on an annual basis and no agreements are reached with the donor agencies for the entire programme.
