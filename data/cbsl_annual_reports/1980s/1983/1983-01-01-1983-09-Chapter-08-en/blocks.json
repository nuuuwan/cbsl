The daily rate of female labour in paddy increased by 21 percent, while male wages increased by 19 per cent. In rubber cultivation, male and female wages increased by 18 percent. In the coconut and tea subsectors, female wage rates, unlike male wages, increased by a higher proportion than in 1982. In the construction sector, carpentry and masonry wages increased by a lesser rate than in 1982. Table 1.34 indicates the average daily wage rates and the changes between 1982 and 1983.",
