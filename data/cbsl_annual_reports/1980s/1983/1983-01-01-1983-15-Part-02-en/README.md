Subsidy and Ex-gratia Payment to Indian Repatriates

The Banlc continued to operate, on behalf of the Government, two schemes to expedite the repatriation of estate workers of Indian origin covered under the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of 1964. These were—

(1) a subsidy scheme in terms of which a sum equivalent to 65 per cent of the authorised remittance or part thereof was paid to such repatriates ; and

(2) an ex-gratia payment of Rs. 500 plus 65 per cent thereof, which was paid as an incentive for these workers to leave the island. The Bank operated these two schemes through the commercial banks.

Loans and Advances

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank Rate) on short term advances to com­mercial banks, secured by the pledge of Government and Government Guaranteed Securities and against the pledge of usance promissory notes relating to commercial and production loans, was reduced from 14 per cent per annum to 13 per cent per annum as from 24th March, 1983. The rate of interest for short term refinance loans to commercial banks granted for the purpose of assisting banks to finance exports from Sri Lanka was reduced from 12 per cent per annum to 11 per cent per annum on 24th March, 1983 and further reduced to 10 per cent per annum as from 1st June, 1983, subject to the condition that the rate of interest on advances so refinanced by commercial banks to their customers dp not exceed 13 per cent per annum. The rates of interest applicable to refinance loans granted under the Medium and Long Term Credit Scheme were reduced by 1 per cent per annum, as from 24th March, 1983. Along with the reduction of short term interest rates, the Central Bank reduced the penal rates for short term r.dvanCes from a range of 21 to 30 per cent per annum to a flat rate of 20 per cent per annum on 30th March, 1983. However, penal rate borrowings were discontinued on 23rd November, 1983.

The Central Bank's accommodation to commercial banks at the Bank Rate and the refinance scheme for exports continued to be in operation during the year. Further­more, the Bank introduced an open-ended supplementary export credit facility on 16th March, 1983 which enabled commercial banks to provide finance to exporters of non-traditional goods at concessionary rates. Under this scheme the Bank entertains applications from commercial banks for the discount of usance promissory notes drawn upto a maximum of 120 days at a discount rate of 7 per cent per annum, subject to the condition that advances of commercial banks to their customers do not exceed 9.75 per cent per annum on discount or 10.80 per cent per annum for advance of full face value.

The rate of interest on Central Bank's advances to commercial banks against the pledge of usance promissory notes of co-operative societies or of individuals relating to the production of paddy, vegetables and other specific crops continued to be 1.5 per cent per annum. The rate of interest on the Bank's advances to commer­cial banks against the pledge of usance promissory notes in respect of advances

( v )

granted by commercial banks to co-operative societies, agrarian service centres and to' authorised persons to finance the purchase of paddy and for the purchase and storage of certain other specified crops grown locally remained unchanged at 3 per cent per annum.

Medium and Long Term Credit Fund

During the year 1983, the Central Bank continued to operate the scheme of refinance under the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund of the Central Bank. The total of refinance loans disbursed during 1983 amounted to Rs. 156.1 million.

Commercial Bank Credit

With effect from 1st November, 1983 the Central Bank directed all commercial banks to ensure that the total amount of advances granted to the private sector and outstanding on or after 1st November, 1983 does not exceed the total amount of advances granted and outstanding as on 31st October, 1983 and to consider certain sectors as priority areas for allocation of credit. This directive was withdrawn with effect from 1st December, 1983.

Reserve Requirements

The reserve requirements of the Central Bank were amended with effect from 2nd December, 1983. The statutory reserve ratio on demand deposits was raised' from 14 per cent to 16 per cent while the ratio on time and savings deposits was raised from 6 per cent to 8 per cent.

With effect from 16th December, 1983 commercial banks were directed to maintain, in addition, as reserve requirements, 16 per cent of the total unutilised balances of overdrafts allowed by such banks.

Treasury Bills

The Central Bank continued its transactions in Treasury Bills under Open Market Operations. The Bank sells Treasury Bills from its own portfolio and purchases Treasury Bills of varying maturities. There was a decline in the total sales of Treasury Bills from Rs. 48,701.9 million in 1982 to Rs. 18,946.9 million in 1983 ; purchases also declined from Rs. 19,110.2 million in 1982 to Rs. 12,668.8 million in 1983. The significant decrease in operations under this scheme can be attributed to the rise of the average call money rate in 1983 when compared with 1982. The rates of discount applicable for Open Market Operations in Treasury Bills during the year Varied between 12 and 13.75 per cent per annum.

Compulsory Savings Fund

The Central Bank continued to be the custodian of the moneys collected in terms of the Compulsory Savings Act No. 6 of 1971 and the Ceiling on Income and Compul­sory Savings Law No. 15 of 1972 and administered the Compulsory Savings Fund; on behalf of the Government. During the year, the Bank paid out to contributors. Rs. 6.4 million (inclusive of interest) on 1,443 refund applications received.

( VI )

Government Accounts

As banker to the Government, the Government Accounts Branch of the Banking Department of the Central Bank continued to maintain accounts of Government Departments, Government Agencies and Institutions and certain Statutory bodies. The number of operative accounts in the Government Accounts Branch as at the end of December, 1983 was 154 (Government Departments 139 and others 15).

CURRENCY ISSUE

The total currency in circulation as at 31st December, 1983 was Rs. 8,173.5 million representing an increase of Rs. 1,317.0 million over the figure for the preceding year. Circulation of currency notes in 1983 increased by Rs. 1,264.5 million and circulation of coins increased by Rs. 52.5 million over the pre­ceding year. During the year under review, the demand for currency notes of the Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 denominations rose substantially. Currency notes of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations in circulation at the end of December, 1983 was Rs. 1,533.5 million and Rs. 2,011.5 million respectively. The rise in circulation of these two denominations resulted in a drop in circulation of currency notes of the Rs.100 denomination over the previous year by Rs. 297.5 million.

Action is being taken to issue coins of Rs. 2 and Rs. 5 denominations in replacement of the notes shortly.

BANKING DEVELOPMENT

The commercial banking sector continued to expand during the year under review. The branch network of domestic banks increased by 16 (Bank of Ceylon-11, People's Bank-3, Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd.-l and Hatton National Bank Ltd.-l). At the end of 1983, the domestic branch network of commercial banks consisted of 679 branches inclusive of Agricultural Service Centre branches of the Bank of Ceylon.

A Merchant Banking Company called ' The People's Merchant Bank Ltd., ' was established during the year by the People's Bank in collaboration with Guinness Mahon and Co. Ltd., a U.K. merchant banking firm. Its establishment was the recognition of the need for financial services ancillary to pure commercial banking, a consequence of the expansion of the banking, financial and business activities over the past few years.

Foreign banks and other financial institutions also continued to evince interest in banking opportunities in Sri Lanka. While no new foreign banks opened branches in Sri Lanka during the year, approval was granted to The Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. of the U.S.A. to open a branch in Colombo. The Bank of Credit & Com­merce International (Overseas) Ltd., (BCCI) was granted permission to open a branch in the Investment Promotion Zone of the GCEC as well as to establish a Foreign Currency Encashment and Exchange Counter at the Colombo International Airport, Katunayake. The Foreign Currency Counter commenced operations in December, 1983.

( vn )

As at the end of 1983, the total number of foreign domiciled banks with branches

in Sri Lanka amounted to 21 of which 14 were established after 1977. Thus, at thfr

end of 1983, there were 25 commercial banks operating in Sri.Lanka, consisting of

4 domestic banks and 21 foreign banks. There were also 2 Representative

Offices of foreign banks, and 2 Merchant Banking Companies (the Bank of Ceylon

having established a merchant bank called 'Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd.,' in

1982), operating in the country. On the basis of the population census held on

17th March, 1981 population per bank branch amounted to 21,870 (approximately)

as at 31st December, 1983.

Despite the fairly substantial network of bank branches that have been esta­

blished throughout the country, the rural areas have not been adequately served.

The Central Bank has therefore formulated a Banking Development Plan which

iff expected to achieve a need-based branch expansion programme tailored to the

special requirements of an area and to achieve a purposeful expansion of credit to

the needy sectors.

BANK SUPERVISION

In t i e year 1983, the examination of nineteen commercial banks under Section

29(1) of the Monetary Law Act was concluded, thereby completing examinations of

every commercial bank operating in Sri Lanka during the. 1982-i- 1983 examination'

period.

The supervision and examination of finance companies registered with the Mone--

tary Board under the provisions of the Control of Finance Companies Act No. 27

of 1979 continued in 1983.: Examinations of eight finance companies under Section

15(1) of the Act were commenced during the year 1983 and three of the examinations

were concluded. In addition, examinations of four finance companies which'

commenced in ,1982 were concluded during the year. Applications received from

finance companies for registration under the Act were evaluated and one finance

company was registered with the Monetary Board during the year. ~

The programme of monitoring transactions of Foreign Currency Banking Units

established by commercial banks under the Foreign Currency Banking Scheme

continued during the period under review.

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE

;•• Demand.for medium and long-term refinance loans from the Central Bank remained low .in 1983. Excess liquidity in the banking system, the diversion of small and medium industry loans for refinance from the National Development Bank of Sri Lanka ( N D B ) , the reduction in the extent of refinance granted to export-oriented projects, a deceleration in investment activity and a suspension of refinance for hotel projects contributed to the drop in demand for refinance.-. - ./.••.;>

( VIII )

In March 1983, rates of refinance applicable to all categories of the Medium and Long-term Credit Fund loans were reduced by 1 per cent. The margin allowed. to banks under the Categories III and IV was reduced from 5 to 4 per cent per annum. Commencing 20th April, 1983 refinance granted to export-oriented projects under the. Category II was reduced from 100 per cent to 70 per cent of the term loan granted. These changes helped to rationalise the Central Bank refinance rates with those offered by development banks for similar purposes.

In 1983, the issue of credit guarantees under the Small and Medium Industry Loan Scheme refinanced by the NDB remained low. Banks lodged 93 credit guarantee applications,. 47 under the SMI-I Scheme, and 46 under the. SMI-IL Scheme, as against 260 applications received under the two schemes in the earlier year. Activity under the SMI-I tapered off owing to the full utilization of the IDA credit by the.. National Development Bank. The slow response to the SMI-II, also financed by. an IDA line of credit is attributable to a lack of enthusiasm among potential entre­preneurs as well as to excess liquidity in the banking system. Also, in the early part on 1983, the SMI-II lending rate prevailed at 20 per cent. The lending rate under SMI-I was 15 per cent per annum. As a corrective measure in.late 198.3, the SMI-II lending rate was brought down to 14 per cent per annum.

The Bank, in 1983, intensified the follow-up work with respect to refinance: loans as well as loans guaranteed by the Bank. The Follow-up Division carried out a • performance survey of projects refinanced by the Bank between 1979 and 1982. . Also, to assess the problems encountered by small and medium scale industry loans guaran­teed by the Bank, 227 projects located in the Districts of Colombo, Gampaha,Kandy, Batticaloa, Hambantota, Badulla and Polonnaruwa were subjected to direct inspec­tions. Inspections revealed sickness in projects owing to technical, marketing and. financial problems. Action is being taken to assist banks in the rehabilitation of sick projects.

The number of credit guarantees issued by the Central Bank increased to 2,537 in 1983; and 1,834 guarantee loans, carrying a guarantee liability of Rs. 122 million remained outstanding. According to participating banks, 966 loans were reported to be in arrears. Consequently, credit supervision, follow-up and rehabili­tation work received greater emphasis in 1983. The Follow-up Division created in 1983 conducted 227 field inspections. An Entrepreneur Development Division was also created in late 1983.

Operations of the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund (MLCF) .

In terms of Section 88 A of the Monetary Law Act, loans granted by credit insti­tutions for productive purposes are refinanced under the Medium and Long-term Credit Fund. In 1983, 38 applications with a refinance component of Rs. 74.8 million were approved. This included 18 applications with a refinance component of Rs. 36.5 million for export-oriented projects under Category II of the Scheme. A breakdown of refinance approvals is shown in Table 2 . 2

II. The Small and Medium Scale Industry (SMI-I) Guarantee Scheme

Under the SMI—I Scheme loans granted by participating credit institutions and refinanced by the National Development Bank, are guaranteed by the Central Bank. The guarantees are issued under Section 108 of the Monetary Law Act. The scheme commenced operations in 1979. The scheme funded by an IDA line of credit (US$ 12.0 million) was fully utilized by 1983. As a result, only 44 credit guarantees were issued to credit institutions in 1983.

As at 31st December, 1983 guarantees amounting to 1,585 were issued in respect of loans amounting to Rs. 265.7 million. The total liability under these guarantees amounted to Rs. 146.5 million of which 14 claims amounting to Rs. 0.112 million were admitted and settled. It was also found that 78 projects remained abandoned owing to market failure, lack of funds or mismanagement. Loans granted for these projects amounted to Rs. 8.7 million and the balance outstanding in December, 1983 amounted to Rs. 6.2 million. However, in certain instances loan instalments continued to be paid with other incomes. An industry-wise classification of SMI-I loans is shown in Table 2.5.

III. Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMI-II) Credit Guarantee Scheme

The SMI-II Scheme which commenced in January, 1982 is funded by an IDA loan of US$ 30.0 million. Funds are channelled through the NDB, which refinances SMI loans granted by participating credit institutions. Under this scheme, loans upto a maximum of Rs. 2.0 million may be granted to a project. Loans refinanced by the NDB are eligible for Central Bank credit guarantees. The extent of the Central Bank guarantees is 62 per cent of the amount in default, subject to a maximum of Rs. 800,000 for each loan. The lending rate for SMI-II loans was reduced from 20 per cent per annum to 14 per cent per annum in the latter part of the year. In the course of 1983, 42 loans were guaranteed under the scheme.

An industry-wise classification of loans guaranteed under SMI-II scheme is shown in Table 2.6.

( XIII ) RURAL CREDIT , ;

j The Central Bank continues to exercise controlling and supervisory functions over rural credit operations of commercial banks while at the same time exerting influence on policy formulation relating to rural credit. The controlling influence of the Central Bank over rural credit operations is exercised by regulating the terms and conditions on which refinance-short, medium and long term-are made available to the commercial banks for lending in the rural sector. The supervisory functions are exercised through periodic inspections undertaken by the Rural Credit department to examine the rural credit portfolios of commercial bank branches-an activity which was started at the end of last year. The chief instrument for exercising influence on policy formulation in this area by the Central Bank is the Rural Credit Advisory Board, which was set up in August, 1981. During the year under review; the Rural Credit Advisory Board held 6 meetings at which several policy issues came up for consideration.

Among the issues considered were the examination of a proposal to establish Regional Rural Development Banks, a Credit Scheme to Assist Rubber Growers, a Credit Scheme for Cultivation of Sugar Cane and measures to assist state sector banks to achieve a reasonable level of profitability in the area of rural credit opera­tions. Draft legislation for the establishment of Regional Rural Development Banks is now under preparation. The credit schemes for the rubber sector is intended to supplement the existing subsidy scheme of the Rubber Control Department. The main purpose of the proposed credit scheme is to give the rubber growers access to cash resources at the beginning of each replanting stage to assist them to undertake cultivation operations. The proposal is under examination. The Rural Credit Advisory Board considered sugar cultivation as a priority sector that should: be encouraged so that farmers in the country undertake diversification of crops arid the country could achieve self-sufficiency in sugar. The banks are expected to assist sugar cane growers, in the country under a medium and long term loan programme in areas serviced by sugar factories, established by public sector or private sector organizations.

During the year under review, the Department took steps to organize a scheme of credit for primary co-operative and thrift societies. Through the proposed credit scheme it is hoped to give these primary societies access to resources which now appear to be reducing the scope of activities of such societies. With the introduction of the scheme early in 1984, it is expected to bring these societies into the main stream of rural credit, thereby enabling them to play a more significant role in rural areas than at present.

Table 2.7 shows the performance of existing credit schemes, undertaken under Category I of the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund operations of the Central Bank. These credit schemes have, either; been initiated by the Central Bank, as for example credit schemes operated through the Regional Offices of the Central Bank, or introduced in response to requests from banks or development agencies of the government. Some, of them are. linked to International Development Association (IDA)/Asian Development Bank (ADB) /International Fund for Agricultural

Development (1FAD) assisted projects. The problem with regard to these credit schemes is the inadequate progress made in the utilization of allocation earmarked for them. At the end of the year under review, out of a total allo­cation of Rs. 654 million, Rs. 421 million remained unutilised. This has been a fea­ture of medium and long term lending in the rural sector ever since the inception of Category I Schemes in 1978. In some cases, however, physical targets have not been achieved for reasons beyond the control of the banks. For example, the dairy sector is plagued by difficulties of getting adequate supply of animals in the right age group and in good health. In some other cases, bad initial planning and design of projects should take the major share of the blame for failure to achieve the targets set. For example, in the Sri Lanka Rural Credit Project and in the Kurunegala District Intergrated Rural Development Project the allocation for 4-wheel tractors was not utilised in view of the shortage of demand for 4-wheel tractors among farmers as a result of escalation in fuel prices. However, in other schemes and with regard to other components greater effort by the lending banks and by the co-ordinating agencies could achieve a significant improvement in the level of utilization. Banks require more skilled manpower with a larger commitment to secure the targets set under various schemes.

During the year under review the following new credit schemes were introduced :

(1) Loans for construction of small on-farm seed potatoes stores in Nuwara Eliya and Badulla Districts.

(2) Agricultural Credit under the Badulla District Integrated Rural Development Programme.

Several adjustments were also made to existing schemes with a view to assisting loan recipients. In the Fisheries Sector Bank Financing Scheme the loan repayment period in respect of a certain class of boats was extended to assist borrowers to repay and to grant them a measure of relief. In several other schemes physical compo­nents were changed and the funds reallocated for items for which there was a ready demand.

The experience in the year 1982 on the Self Employment and Village Adoption Scheme implemented by the Regional Office, Matara encouraged the Central Bank to enhance the size of the projects assisted under this programme from Rs. 6;000 to Rs. 12,000, thus enabling the Regional Office to promote somewhat larger projects in the area. Also, with the addition of the Moneragala and Hambantota Districts as areas coming under the purview of the Regional Office at Matara, an irrigation component and a farm power component based on 2-wheel tractors have been in­corporated into the bank scheme. A similar scheme is in operation in the Anu-radhapura District. The accent of this programme at Anuradhapura is on the pro­motion of the Minor Irrigation System based on tapping of underground.water through open dug wells, with pump sets and windmills.

The Asian Development Bank assisted Sri Lanka Rural Credit Project in which the Central Bank has a major role to play as the co-ordinating agency, made satis­factory progress during the year. The orders on hand exceed the total number of

( XVI .)

;2-wheel tractors available for sale and it is expected to complete the sale of these 2-wheel tractors in the first quarter of 1984. The work on the irrigation component under this project for which the Water Resources Board is the executing agency has also shown progress and it is expected" that the Water Resources Board would make arrangements early in 1984 to procure the equipment.

The Rescheduling Scheme which commenced in 1982 was operated during the year and the last date".for applications was extended to 30th June, 1984. However, there has been a complete lack of progress in the scheme. The number of appli­cants remain around 2,050 whereas the total number of defaulters of loans from the 'Bank of Ceylon is around 82,300.

. During the year under review, the Central Bank undertook the inspection of the iiiral credit portfolios of 19 commercial banks and co-operative banks. They included 7 branches of the People's Bank, 7 co-operative rural banks, 3 branches 'of the Bank of Ceylon and 2 Agrarian Service Centre Offices affiliated to the Bank 'of Ceylon in Galle, Polonnaruwa, Harhbantota, Kuruhegala and Moiieragala Districts. These inspection reports were completed and issued to the banks with a .request for a compliance report from them.

A mid term survey was undertaken on the progress of projects financed by the Regional Office of the Central Bank at Matara to assess the progress on repayments 'on the loans granted under this project This report was finalised and issued during the year. In addition, two survey reports relating to the Survey.on Utilization of Loans for Small Holders for Cultivation of Orchids and the Survey on the ^Fisheries Loans granted in the Kalutara District conducted in 1982 were also finalised during the year. -

SURVEYS

A study has been undertaken in association with the,World Bank on " T h e Evolution of Living Standards and Policy in Sri Lanka since 1970." The study is aimed at analysing trends in living standards of Sri Lanka over the past decade in. the context of the policy initiatives which have been promoted by the Government.

The Bank continued to monitor the import liberalization programme by obtain* ing monthly data on Letters of Credit opened for imports.

RURAL BANKING AND STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

•The Rural Banking and Staff Training College organized and conducted twenty-one training courses, seminars and workshops where 554 middle and senior level management personnel from commercial banks and other financial institutions participated. One programme, 'Risks and Controls in Foreign Exchange' was co-sponsored by Citibank, Colombo while the ' Trainers ' Training Programme' was conducted by a team of foreign consultants who were in the country on a special assignment. • .:

These training programmes covered areas relating to credit managements project identification and evaluation, commercial banking, capital market opera* tions, management development, financing of animal husbandry schemes, small plantations, marine and inland fisheries, merchant banking and off-shore bankings

.... . .. ,.•••( Training of officers in rural banking and credit was considered a priority area for training. Programmes were also conducted in the outstations.

The College completed its second year of operations in September, 1983. The second anniversary lecture of the College was delivered by Dr. W. M. Tilaka* ratna, Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning on the topic ' The Role of Banks: in Development'. _ . . ,

PUBLICATIONS

The Annual Report of the Central Bank for the year 1982 was presented to the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning in terms of the Section - 35 of the Monetary Law Act. The Review of the Economy- 1982 wais also published later in the year, while the Monthly Bulletin was published regularly.

Two issues of the Staff Studies namely Vol 11 No. 1 and 2 and Vol. 12 No. 1 were published during the year. Vol. 5 of the Economic and Social Statistics was also published, while a Socio Economic Data folder containing basic data on the economy was issued. The Price and Wage Statistics - 1982 containing data collected under the country wide, data collection system was released during the period under review.

In addition, a booklet entitled " Guide to Banking in Sri Lanka" and the Credit Bulletin No. 3 on " Finance for Exports " were published during the year.* Occasional Papers No. 5 containing an address by the Governor on " Rural Deve* lopment Initiatives" and No. 6 containing the Second Annivesary address at the Rural Banking and Staff Training College by Dr. W. M. Tilakaratna on the topic " The Role of Banks in Development" were published. . . . • / , . < '.•(•

( XVIII )

The News Survey of the Bank and the Sinhala publication " Satahana " were continued to be published and both publications appeared to be popular among the reading public judging from the demand for them.

TRAINING

Training of officers both in the academic and non-academic (practical training)

fields continued during the year under review.

Five officers proceeded abroad on post-graduate studies in Economics. Fifty eight officers proceeded abroad on short term training programmes mainly in the fields of rural, agricultural and industrial credit, banking and economics.

At the same time, training was also conducted locally mainly at the Bank's. Rural Banking & Staff Training College. With the College emerging as a major source of training in Sri Lanka for personnel in the banking and financial sector, the need to send Central Bank officers for training at other local training centres was reduced. A total of 71 officers followed training courses at the College. The training programme in Commercial Banking Practices and Operations for Central Bank officers at the Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank continued throughout the year, and will be continued in 1984 too.

SEMINARS

In addition to the seminars organised by the Rural Banking and Staff Training College, the Bank organised seminars on topics of current interest. The first of such seminars was on Interest Rates and was held in Colombo, while the second on Rural Credit and Development was held in Badulla with the aim of securing a wider participation of the people engaged in development in rural areas. The purpose of this seminar was to educate the people on facilities offered by commercial banks for those engaged in agriculture, industry and self employment projects, to publicise the role of the Central Bank in this respect, to enable bank officers in rural areas to gather knowledge about the new trends in rural credit and to facilitate data collect tion in these fields on a regular basis.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

The Committee on Customer Services in Banking which was established in mid 1981 has been functioning since then mainly with the objective of improving commer­cial banks' services to customers in the context of an expanding economy. It comprises senior officials of the Central Bank, commercial banks and certain deve­lopment oriented ministries and government institutions. During the year 1983, the Committee was mainly concerned with the matters of expediting bank tran­sactions, such as encashment of cheques and foreign drafts and granting of loans. The Committee also examined in detail the provision of bank finance to the export sector. The Committee also discussed the need to expand the information services of banks to assist both banks and customers.

( XIX )

TASK FORCE

The Hon. Minister of Finance appointed a Task Force to assess the damage caused to commercial and industrial enterprises in July, 1983. This Task Force was headed by the Director of Statistics and consisted of Senior Officials in the Minis­tries of Finance and Planning, Industries and Scientific Affairs, Textile Industries, Trade & Shipping and in the Central Bank. The report of the Task Force was submitted on 16th August, 1983.

REGIONAL OFFICE—MATARA

During the year 1983, Matara Regional Office of the Central Bank of Ceylon continued to expand its rural credit and regional development activities which were, initially introduced as pilot schemes. Accordingly, the Self-Employment Scheme (SES) and the Village Adoption Scheme (VAS) were actively promoted by the, Regional Office which also assisted the banks in the area in identifying projects and conducting training programmes.

Training programmes were intended to provide technical and management skills for the prospective borrowers from the banks in sectors such as poultry farming, dairy farming, horticulture and small industrial ventures. In all, 36 sessions of training involving 1,361 participants were conducted under the training programmes which were organised with the assistance of commercial banks, government institu­tions and other relevant agencies in the area. The provision of basic training was supplemented with field investigations and preparation of appraisal reports on viable economic projects. Furthermore, the prospective borrowers were assisted in' obtaining banking facilities and back-up services such as marketing for the successful implementation of projects. Finally, the supervision of end use of loans and follow-up action to ensure loan repayment were also undertaken by the Regional Office' with the assistance of commercial banks.

The refinance assistance for Self-Employment Schemes (SES) was mainly designed to promote self employment activities among the unemployed youth in the district. As at end 1983 the Regional Office had recommended to the commercial banks 460 projects under this scheme, of which 268 projects were approved for. financing with a total loan value of Rs. 1,186,130. Of the projects recommended under the SES, about one fourth was in the agricultural sector including poultry and dairy farming, while the majority belonged to non-agricultural activities such as brick making, coir products, confectionery and garments.

Refinance assistance under Village Adoption Schemes (VAS) was based on the concept of providing credit for integrated rural development with a view to promoting rural income and employment generation using an " area approach ". As at end of 1983 five villages have been adopted by the banks under this scheme. Although the total credit disbursed appeared to be relatively small, the impact of this project in terms of organizing farmers and villagers and training of villagers as welll as developing relationships between the bankers and villagers has been quite significant,

( xx )

The two state banks, i.e. Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank, and the Indian Overseas Bank were actively involved in financing the projects recommended by Matara. Regional Office during the year under review. A consolidated statement indicating the progress of projects under the Self Employment Scheme (SES) and the Village Adoption Scheme (VAS) is given in Table 2.8 The total number recommended under both SES and VAS categories amounted to 503 projects. Of this number, 297 projects have been financed by banks involving a sum of Rs. 1,281,115. The estimated number of jobs created under these projects totalled 523 as at end December, 1983. .

Due to effective efforts taken to ensure utilization of the loans for the recom­mended purposes, the repayment position of projects of which the gestation period had ended, reflected 78 per cent as at end of December, 1983. While several loans were fully recovered during this period, some of the beneficiaries were recommended tot enhanced financial assistance for their projects. The progress on repayment of capital is depicted in Table 2.9 which shows the satisfactory recovery position of the loans.

The Regional Office also embarked on a programme to stimulate rural economic activities through the mobilisation of collective and co-operative attitudes of the rural people as a basis for obtaining bank finance. Among the various clusters of economic activities organised during the year under review were home-gardening, livestock and small industries. Several voluntary and non-governmental organiza­tions in the area assisted in this effort. Furthermore, some of these activities were extended to cover the Hambantota and Moneragala districts as well.

The introduction of " Credit Camps " for speedy sanctioning and disbursement Qf paddy cultivation loans under the Central Bank Refinance Scheme proved to be quite successful. The Regional Office also initiated a Model Yaya Paddy Cultiva­tion Loan Scheme (MPCLS) in Matara district with a view to organizing farmers using the cultivation unit of "Yaya " as the basis rather than the individual farmer. This scheme also aimed at improving agricultural practices,.adopting flexible banking procedures, providing technical services under " farm clinics " and ensuring better disbursement and recovery of loans. In 1983 Yala and 1983-84 Maha Rs. 304,940 was granted as loans to 260 farmers covering 460 acres in six villages in the district.

In consultation with the Regional Office, the Indian Overseas Bank introduced several regional loan schemes for activities such as poultry keeping, cultivation of coconut and tea replanting, sugarcane, and purchase of 2-wheel tractors, for which Central Bank refinance facilities were made available. Similarly, the People's Bank and Bank of Ceylon implemented a regionalloan scheme to provide financial assis­tance to tea smallholders for purchase of fertilizer for which Central: Bank refinance was available^ '

The Regional Office in Matara continued to conduct the Regional Clearing House, transacting two daily clearings with the four commercial banks in the area. The clearing transaction^ amounted to Rs. 821million during the year 1983.

REGIONAL OFFICE—ANURADHAPURA

The Regional Office of Anuradhapura is in its second year of operation. Anu-radhapura being the largest administrative district in the island, activities of the Regional Office are still confined to the district itself. In view of the heavy demand for Central Banking services from commercial banks and other agencies in neigh­bouring districts such as Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee and Puttalam, an expansion of the Regional Office activities to cover at least some of these districts is envisaged.

In addition to the supervision of development and agricultural lending in the district, work on the Refinance Loan Scheme of the Regional Office continued during the year under review. This scheme was introduced in the year 1982 in order to promote development finance for small scale projects in the hitherto unbanked areas in the district. It also provides a sound footing for a close and continuous dialogue between the bankers, rural masses and the Government agencies which will result in an expansion of banking facilities for the rural sector in the long run. In order to enlarge the coverage of the scheme, the operations that were confined to only 6 AGA Divisions in the inaugural year were expanded to the whole district covering 20 AGA Divisions. Prospective borrowers under this scheme are identified through a series of group meetings, personal discussions and visits to project sites. The assistance of Assistant Government Agents, voluntary and government agencies involved in rural development and also field level officials are obtained in this regard.

TABLE 2 . 9

( XXIII )

In the selection of projects, highest priority is given to agricultural projects with lift irrigation facilities in order to harness underground water resources for cultivation purposes mainly during the Yala season. Project leading for develop­ment of livestock, too, was considered a key area. Nearly 83 per cent of the total projects recommended are for agriculture and livestock development. Prospective borrowers are provided with training in their respective fields.

As at end December, 1983 the number of projects recommended under the scheme to the Bank of Ceylon, the People's Bank, the Hatton National Bank Ltd. and the State Bank of India for provision of credit amounting to Rs. 3.5 million was 637. Details are indicated in Table 2.10.

As at end December, 1983 branches of the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank sanctioned an aggregate of Rs. 1 million for 186 projects. Out of the total sum sanctioned Rs. 724,125 was disbursed for 128 projects during the year under review.

In order to ensure steady progress of the units financed, the Regional Office in addition to training facilities, provided extension services and continued guidance and counselling in operational and managerial spheres.

The projects that commenced during the year provided new employment oppor­tunities to 91 persons while establishing 78 persons in full employment. The gross turnover of the total projects commenced is estimated at Rs. 5.3 million.

Of the total projects financed, 62 projects commenced repayment of loan instal­ments to the banks. Nearly 87 per cent of the total sum due to the banks has been settled by the borrowers.

In addition to long and medium term project financing, a cultivation programme was carried out in one of the remotest villages, namely Galahitiyagama in the Horowapothana AGA Division. A sum of Rs. 74,440 was disbursed by the Horowapothana branch of the Bank of Ceylon towards this project. This cultivation programme is undertaken with a view to launching a long term integrated development programme with project financing in future.

In addition, the Regional Office during the period under review expanded its activities in the areas of inspection of Co-operative Rural Banks, supervision of SMI Projects and collection of consumer prices and producer prices under the Country­wide Data Collection Scheme. While supervising the work of the Data Collectors, the Regional Office collects independent data on a continuing basis on retail prices of consumer goods and producer prices of major agricultural products. Meanwhile, collection of economic data on other major activities such as production of sub­sidiary crops, tourist arrivals in the city etc. and data on small scale industrial pro­jects in the region continues to be done.

Act. These activities are carried out by the Employees' Provident Fund Department of the Bank in close co-operation with the Employees' Provident Fund Division of the Labour Department which attends to the adminis­tration and the enforcement of the provisions of the Act. A brief note on its ope­rations during the year 1983 is given below.

Contributions

The contributions received by the Fund during the year 1983 amounted to Rs. 1,201.7 million as against Rs. 1,079.6 million in 1982. This represents an increase of 11 per cent over the level of contributions received during the previous year.

The total investments held by the Fund as at 31st December, 1983 amounted to Rs. 8,956.7 " million, which is an increase of Rs. 1,712.4 million over the level of 1982.

Income received from Investments

- In 1983, the income from investments of the Fund amounted to Rs. 923.4 million as against Rs. 658.5 million in 1982 recording an increase of 40 per cent. •This increase was mainly due to the investment of the increased volume of contribu­t i o n s received by the Fund and the re-investment of income derived from thepast investments during the year under review.

Refunds

The total sum paid out by way of refunds of EPF benefits to members during the - year 1983 amounted to Rs. 383.6 million as against a sum of Rs. 372.6 million in 1982.

The number of claims paid out during .the year totalled 55,082.

Interest on Members' Balances

The Employees' Provident Fund is required to pay interest on members' . balances as at end of each year out of the income from investment of monies of the

* Fund. The rate of interest payable on members' balances as at end of 1982 was raised to 10 per cent per annum in 1983 as against 9.5 per cent in 1981, Interest is :' paid on the balances standing to the credit of members at the end of the year and thereafter interest accumulates on the aggregate sum. Besides, interest is paid for the entire year on the balance standing to the member's credit at the end of the year irrespective of the date when any portion of that balance (which represents the current * year's contributions) was received by the Fund to the member's credit, eg. contributions received in December attracts interest for the full year in the same way as contributions received in January of that year. Therefore, the effective rate of interest is approxi­mately 11.2 per cent.
