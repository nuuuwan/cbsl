Activity under the SMI-I tapered off owing to the full utilization of the IDA credit by the.. National Development Bank. The slow response to the SMI-II, also financed by. an IDA line of credit is attributable to a lack of enthusiasm among potential entre\u00adpreneurs as well as to excess liquidity in the banking system. Also, in the early part on 1983, the SMI-II lending rate prevailed at 20 per cent. The lending rate under SMI-I was 15 per cent per annum.

The controlling influence of the Central Bank over rural credit operations is exercised by regulating the terms and conditions on which refinance-short, medium and long term-are made available to the commercial banks for lending in the rural sector. The supervisory functions are exercised through periodic inspections undertaken by the Rural Credit department to examine the rural credit portfolios of commercial bank branches-an activity which was started at the end of last year. The chief instrument for exercising influence on policy formulation in this area by the Central Bank is the Rural Credit Advisory Board, which was set up in August, 1981. During the year under review; the Rural Credit Advisory Board held 6 meetings at which several policy issues came up for consideration.",

Draft legislation for the establishment of Regional Rural Development Banks is now under preparation. The credit schemes for the rubber sector is intended to supplement the existing subsidy scheme of the Rubber Control Department. The main purpose of the proposed credit scheme is to give the rubber growers access to cash resources at the beginning of each replanting stage to assist them to undertake cultivation operations. The proposal is under examination. The Rural Credit Advisory Board considered sugar cultivation as a priority sector that should: be encouraged so that farmers in the country undertake diversification of crops arid the country could achieve self-sufficiency in sugar. The banks are expected to assist sugar cane growers, in the country under a medium and long term loan programme in areas serviced by sugar factories, established by public sector or private sector organizations.",

At the end of the year under review, out of a total allo\u00adcation of Rs. 654 million, Rs. 421 million remained unutilised. This has been a fea\u00adture of medium and long term lending in the rural sector ever since the inception of Category I Schemes in 1978. In some cases, however, physical targets have not been achieved for reasons beyond the control of the banks. For example, the dairy sector is plagued by difficulties of getting adequate supply of animals in the right age group and in good health. In some other cases, bad initial planning and design of projects should take the major share of the blame for failure to achieve the targets set. For example, in the Sri Lanka Rural Credit Project and in the Kurunegala District Intergrated Rural Development Project the allocation for 4-wheel tractors was not utilised in view of the shortage of demand for 4-wheel tractors among farmers as a result of escalation in fuel prices. However, in other schemes and with regard to other components greater effort by the lending banks and by the co-ordinating agencies could achieve a significant improvement in the level of utilization. Banks require more skilled manpower with a larger commitment to secure the targets set under various schemes.",

    "text": "In addition to the supervision of development and agricultural lending in the district, work on the Refinance Loan Scheme of the Regional Office continued during the year under review. This scheme was introduced in the year 1982 in order to promote development finance for small scale projects in the hitherto unbanked areas in the district. It also provides a sound footing for a close and continuous dialogue between the bankers, rural masses and the Government agencies which will result in an expansion of banking facilities for the rural sector in the long run. In order to enlarge the coverage of the scheme, the operations that were confined to only 6 AGA Divisions in the inaugural year were expanded to the whole district covering 20 AGA Divisions. Prospective borrowers under this scheme are identified through a series of group meetings, personal discussions and visits to project sites. The assistance of Assistant Government Agents, voluntary and government agencies involved in rural development and also field level officials are obtained in this regard.",
