"9 (1) Every affected property, industry or business shall, with effect from the date these Regulations come into force, vest absolutely in the State free from all encumbrances.

(2) Where any question arises as to whether any property, industry or business is an affected property, industry or business, such question shall be decided by REPIA by a declaration in writing and such declaration shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in questions in any court in any proceedings whatsoever.

" affected business or industry " means any undertaking of a com­mercial or industrial nature damaged or destroyed on or after July 24, 1983, and includes, subject to the provisions of these regulations, all rights, powers, privileges and interests arising in or out of such undertaking."

Every such representation, which whould be made through a commercial bank, should provide details of the kind of property, industry or business, its location and particulars of its ownership and should state that the applicant is prepared to undertake any repairs necessary and, where applicable, continue to carry on business without recourse to State assistance.

4. Any such request received by a commercial bank should be transmitted to REPIA by the commercial bank under cover of a letter conveying its observations and recommendations.

5. The Central Bank has been given to understand that the Board of Directors of REPIA appreciates that it is necessary that normal banking activity should be carried on and that day-to-day banking operations should not be disturbed. With these ends in view, it will recognize all existing arrangements between banks and such of their customers as may be affected by the Regulations, including the payment of cheques to the extent that accounts are in credit or overdraft limits are available.
