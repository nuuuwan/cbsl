Judged in terms of indicators such as the number of arrivals, earnings, hotel occupancy or employment, the performance of this sector in 1983 was sub-normal. The most glaring reason for the low level of activity was the July disturbances. In addition, the economic situation in Western Europe (which is our main tourist generating market) was still sluggish as many nations were in a state of transition from recession into recovery with no tangible benefits trickling down to Sri Lanka.",

    "text": "Foreign exchange earnings from tourism in 1983 slumped to become only the sixth highest foreign exchange inflow into Sri Lanka in comparison with the fourth place it occupied in 1982 . Tourist arrivals in 1983 declined by 17 per cent compared . with the previous year and stood at 337,342. This was the first time since 1971, that the positive trend in tourist traffic growth was reversed even though the rate of growth in tourist arrivals, has been declining over the past few years. The effect of the July disturbances on arrival figures is clearly evident by the fact that during the first six months of 1983 tourist arrivals increased by 10 per cent compared with the same period of the previous year but decreased by 45 per cent for the latter six months. However, another factor worth noting is that arrivals in June, 1983 were lower than those in the corresponding month in 1982 and this was due to the decline in the number of arrivals from India as a result of the restrictions imposed by the Indian Government on the duty-free allowance afforded to its nationals. Arrivals, from Western Europe and Australasia recorded the highest negative growth rates during the year and decreased by 24 and 22 per cent respectively. Arrivals from Asia dec\u00adlined by 8 per cent. This was mainly due to a drop in Indian tourists by 6 per cent. Arrivals from North America dropped by 5 per cent. Arrivals from Eastern Europe however, increased by 7 per cent during, the year under review. Arrivals o f \" ex\u00adcursionists \" (temporary visitors staying in the country for less than 24 hours exclu\u00adding travellers in transit) totalled 8,836 in 1983 compared with 6,632 in 1982 recording an increase of 33 per cent.",

The East Coast, Hill Country and the Ancient Cities Regions had occupancy rates in the vicinity of about 30 per cent. The Northern Region had the lowest occupancy rate at 11 per cent. A year by year comparison of occupancy rates shows that the Northern Region and the East Coast were the most severely affected. Occupancy rates dropped by 45 per cent and 36 per cent in 1983 and this may be attributed to the security problems associated with these areas which may have deterred tourists. The South Coast and the Ancient Cities Region also experienced a disastrous year as occupancy rates declined by 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively u r 1983: This problem has been aggravated by the unplanned increase in the number of rooms in the graded accommodation sector especially in the South Coast. Considering the declining trend in hotel occupancy over the past few years expansion plans do riot appear to have been adequately appraised. Occupancy rates in the Hill Country, Greater Colombo and Colombo City declined by 21 per cent, 19 per1 cent and 17 per cent respectively in 1983. The Bed/Room ratio decreased from 1.7 in 1982 t o 1.65 in 1983. This indicates that there were, 165 guests in occupation in every 100 rooms sold. In view of the excess capacity in the graded accomodation sector the Government stopped granting fiscal incentives (tax holidays and duty-free importation of equipment etc.) to new hotel projects from April, 1983, Parallel with this, Central Bank refinance facilities to this sector were also curtailed in order to restrict investment. The graded accomodation sector was most acutely affected by the reduction in tourist traffic following the disturbances and some resort hotels had to partially close down and lay-off employees in an effort to' safeguard financial viability. Many hotels experienced severe liquidity problems.",

    "text": "In order to resuscitate the tourist industry in Sri Lanka, the Government allo\u00adcated a sum of Rs. 40 milhon to be spent on a massive advertising campaign abroad to attract visitors to the country. The Government has also lowered the rate of Business Turnover Tax for the tourist sector from 15 per cent to 10 per cent in an .attempt to cushion the hardship experienced by the industry as a result of the slump in activity. A new promotional strategy is being devised to diversify the source of tourist traffic in order to overcome the problem of relying on a narrow market. There is also a plan to attract the upper income segment of the market which has hitherto by passed Sri Lanka and to encourage special interest and convention traffic which generates greater income.",

    "text": "In 1983 a marked improvement in the terms of trade and a further increase in worker remittances resulted in a substantial narrowing of the current account deficit in SDR terms. In this year the current account deficit was Rs. 11,185 million (SDR 445 million) as compared with Rs. 11,919 million (SDR 519 million) in 1982. The year under review saw a dramatic reversal of the factors that resulted in an adverse balance of payments situation in 1982. The terms of trade which had been declining continuously since 1977 improved in Sri Lanka's favour due mainly to the boom in the prices of Sri Lanka's major plantation exports and the decline in oil prices. Measured in SDR terms, exports grew by 7.6 per cent while imports declined by 1 psr cent. In contrast 1982 was characterised by a sluggish growth of exports and an acceleration in imports. The Current account deficit as a percentage of GDP declined from 11.9 per cent in 1982 to 9.4 per cent in 1983. When official transfers are excluded, the current account deficit is Rs. 15,201 million (SDR 605 million) as compared with Rs! 15,298 million (SDR 666 million) in 1982 and the ratio of current account to GDP fell from 15.3 per cent to 12.4 per cent between these two years.",

Due mainly to very favourable prices being obtained there was a substantial turn around in the combined export earnings. In contrast to a decline of 6.9 per cent in 1982 export earnings from the traditional plantation sector increased by 18.5 per cent in 1983. Export earnings from non-traditional exports (excluding petroleum products) increased by 5.7 per cent due entirely to an increase in textile and readymade garments exports and gem exports.",

However, the marginal decline in imports was accompanied by a slight shift away from intermediate and investment goods, to consumption goods.

Outlays on petroleum and investment goods declined by 18 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.",
