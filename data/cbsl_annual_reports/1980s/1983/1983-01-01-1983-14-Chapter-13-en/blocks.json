    "text": "The Government was. able to contain its net borrowings from the banking system to a marginal increase of 2 per cent on account of favourable developments, both in the domestic and external sectors. Firstly, utilisation of Central Bank profits amounting to Rs. 1,500 million in March, 1983 reduced Governments depen\u00addence on the banking system which was reflected in the reduction in other liabilities (net) of the Central Bank. Secondly, increased subscriptions to rupee securities by captive sources (The National Savings Bank, The Employees' Providept Fund, Sinking Funds etc.) enabled the Government to reduce recourse to bank financing. Thirdly, the.'Government was able.^ta increase its revenue collection, due to high import duties and turnover taxes introduced in early 1983 and on account of increased receipts from tea ad-valorem taxes, Further, a reduction in the capital expenditure and the utilisation of the Japanese Yen loan and the part proceeds of the Euro-Currency loan helped the Government to minimise its borrowings from the banking system.",

Of the total increase in gross \"credit to private sector (GCPS), a major share (95 percent) was on' account of an increase in credit granted to the other private sector constituents (OPSG). Gross credit to this sector rose by 32 per cent when compared with 26 per cent last year. The increase in private sector credit in the first quarter may have been due to increased economic activities following the elections in the vlatter part of: 1982. The increase in demand for credit due to reduction in short term interest rates in mid.year was further accentuated by the impact of July dis\u00adturbances. A delay in the repayments (Rs. 800 million approximately) of loans and advances by some business concerns in the private sector due to the disturbances and the maximum utilization of the approved over-draft limits kept the outstanding credit at high levels.. At the same time, there was a delay in the receipt of export proceeds during the third quarter. In addition to the existing loans, the banks were also compelled to provide new loans to the affected business concerns to com\u00admence production. The outstanding loans and advances also rose on account of banks stepping in to meet the credit needs of the services sector which were hitherto greatly financed by operations of the Pettah Kerb Market.",

The external banking assets, however, showed an erratic behaviour during the year. Of this, the largest monthly increase was in November, 1983. This was mainly due to the purchases of foreign exchange from commercial banks arising from high export proceeds (Rs.3,948 million), drawings under the IMF Stand-By Arrangement (Rs. 517 million), utilization of the Japanese Yen loan (Rs. 331 million) and part proceeds of the Euro Currency Loan (Rs. 625 million) which raised the holdings of cash and balances abroad of the Central Bank.",

    "text": "During the year, commercial banking was characterised by periodic liquidity problems. The liquidity constraints experienced by banks worsened towards the second half of the year. This was primarily caused by an enhanced demand for credit from the other private sector since July, 1983. Credit to this sector which rose by 13 per cent during the first six months of the year, increased by 3 per cent in July and to a further 6 per cent in August which was the highest recorded in any single month in 1983. The sharp rise in credit partly reflected the impact of the downward revision of interest rates effected during the first half of the year. Accord\u00ading to commercial bank sources, the high level of credit was also due to lower repay\u00adments on the part of the customers who were affected by the July disturbances. The banks also assisted the affected customers by providing fresh credit, extending the maturity periods of loans and lowering the rates of interest on such loans. As revealed by several indicators, liquidity problems became rather acute during the fourth quarter of the year. Due to increased demand for funds, particularly, by foreign banks whose deposit base was narrow, the rates in the inter-bank call money market rose to high levels. These rates which prevailed at a range of 15.75-18.50 per cent per annum at end 1982 rose to a range of 18.5-35.0per cent per annum by end October and further to 20-37 per cent per annum by end December 1983. Com\u00admercial banks also resorted to borrowings from the Central Bank at penal rates to tide over their temporary liquidity problems.",

T h e preference on the part of commercial banks to attract short term time and savings deposits mirrored the uncertainty in financial circles regarding the future movements of interest rates. Banks also continued to issue Certificates of Deposits (CDs) attracting a fair amount of hoarded money to the banking system. By end 1983,20 banks had been given formal apprdval to issue CDs and the outstanding amount of CDs as at the same date amounted to Rs. 610 million. Facilities for encashment of foreign drafts were further widened during the year. The Bank of Ceylon inaugurated a special service for the encashment of such drafts on Saturdays. Meanwhile, the Bank of Credit and Commerce Inter\u00adnational (Overseas) Ltd. established a Foreign Currency Encashment and Exchange Counter at the Colombo Airport, Katunayake.",

These developments afforded an opportunity for the Central Bank to review its interest rate policy and introduce modifications where necessary to take account of specific needs. With the focus on export-led growth it became necessary to provide concessional credit to the export sector. It was felt that the high, interest rate policy pursued for demand management purposes had some unfavourable effects on the working capital requirements of priority sectors due to the high cost of credit.

Accordingly, effective 24th March, the rate of interest on Central Bank refinance to commercial banks on pre-shipment export credit was reduced from 12 to 11 percent per annum. In the case of medium and long term refinance facilities, the interest rates on all categories of the Medium and Long-term Credit Fund (MLCF) were reduced by 1 percentage point. In addition to these concessions, the Central Bank introduced a supplementary refinance facility on 16th March, 1983 with a view to catering to the needs of the non-traditional export sector (excluding petroleum products, garments, gems and marine products). At the inception of the scheme, the Central Bank discoun\u00adted promissory notes executed by exporters and tendered to commercial banks at 8.5 per cent per annum while commercial banks were allowed to rediscount at a rate not exceeding 12 per cent per annum. Effective 24th March, 1983, the discount rate was reduced to 7 per cent per annum while commercial banks were permitted to \u2022 rediscount promissory notes at 11 per cent per annum. The latter was further reduced to 9.75 per cent per annum with effect from 9th June, 1983. However, in the case of promissory notes pledged with banks by way of security for preshipment advances, the applicable interest rate was prescribed at 10.80 per cent per annum. The scope of this scheme was expanded in July 1983, to include certain categories of marine, rubber and coconut products and again in October to include the re-export of diamonds. Another important step taken by the Central Bank for the promotion of the export sector was the establishement of an Export Credit Cell (ECC) within the Central Bank with the objective of considering representations of exporters on problems in connection with export finance, in particular, and export development, in general. The ECC is expected to examine representations made by the exporter community and attempt to find appropriate solutions to their problems.",

Along with this revision, with the objective of reducing the cost of credit at the pre-shipment stage, the Central Bank reduced the refinance rate on pre-shipment export credit from 11 per cent to 10 per cent while the on-lending margin permitted to commercial banks was also reduced from 4 to 3 per cent per annum. With effect from 22nd September, the overall limit for export, credit refinance was further increased by 10 per cent.",

    "text": "The monetary and credit conditions experienced during the second half of 1983 were mainly influenced by the policy measures introduced during the first half of 1983, and to an extent by the effect of July disturbances. By end August, the growth rate of private sector credit reached the highest ever recorded level for the year. The unprecedentedly high expansion in credit increased inflationary pressures in the economy and necessitated corrective action. Against this background, as a temporary measure, the Central Bank imposed a credit ceiling on commercial bank advances to the private sector with effect from 1st November, 1983 with a view to containing the rapid increase in credit levels. Accordingly, the commercial banks were required to ensure that the total amount of its advances to the private sector granted and outstanding on or after 1st November, 1983, did not exceed the total amount of such advances granted and outstanding on 31st October, 1983. However, in allocating credit within the limit, the commercial banks were advised to give preference to specified priority sectors.",

Accordingly, the statutory reserve requirement was increased from 14 to 16 per cent on demand deposits and from 6 to 8 per cent on time and savings deposits. In addition, for the first time, the Central Bank introduced a reserve ratio of 16 per cent on unutilised balances of overdraft limits allowed to the private sector held with commercial banks with effect from 16th December, 1983. Furthermore, effective 14th November, 1983, the Central Bank reduced the availabi\u00adlity of accommodation under the penal rate from 90 per cent of the value of colla\u00adterals submitted by banks to 50 per cent and further to 25 per cent on the 22nd of November. Effective 23rd November, 1983, the grant of advances at the penal rate was discontinued and commercial banks were required not to exceed the quotas allocated to them under the Bank rate for temporary liquidity requirements.",

    "text": "The monetary expansion in 1983 was greatly influenced by the unprecedented increase in credit to the private sector. This was further augmented by the sharp rise in external assets during the last two months of the year. Accordingly, credit and monetary growth indicated deviations from the targetted levels set for the year in the National Credit Plan. However, the monetary policy measures effected in the latter half of the year reduced the sharp increase in credit and helped to maintain the monetary expansion at a more manageable level of 22 per cent.",
