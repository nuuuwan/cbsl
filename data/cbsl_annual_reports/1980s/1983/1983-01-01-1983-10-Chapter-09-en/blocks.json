While most imports were free from direct controls, growth in exports was considered a critical necessity for the continued expansion of the economy. However, in 1983 developments in the export sector seemed to indicate a setback ; there was a drop in the export volumes of both tea and rubber, while exports of minor agricultural crops also declined substantially from their levels in 1982. While these shortfalls were compensated by price increases, the need to increase production for exports in a sustainable manner cannot be overempha\u00adsised.",

    "text": "Under the liberalised trade policy State Trading Organisations (STOs) were expected to be commercially viable and to compete efficiently with the private sector. Therefore STOs attempted to diversify and expand their activities. However, strong competition from the private sector tended to depress their level of activity. According to tentative estimates the turnover of STOs was Rs. 5,910 million in 1983 compared to Rs. 4,123 million in 1982. The increased sales in 1983 is mainly a reflection of higher prices. The trading activities of certain STOs were affected by the necessity for them to maintain buffer stocks as a measure of levelling out availability of certain essential commodities. There were instances when this added to the liqui\u00addity problems that many institutions experienced. The Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) continued to maintain buffer stock of consumer items such as masoor dhal, bombay onions, corriander, dried fish and dried chillies. The volume of sugar imports by the Food Commissioner's Department (FCD) recorded a sharp increase while sales of rice by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) in the open market also increased by about 60 per cent in 1983.",

    "text": "The co-operative societies have consitituted an integral part of the established network for the distribution of essential consumer items since the 2nd world war. In recent years the co-operatives attempted to adjust their trading policies and practices in the face of the strong competition from the private sector. Although new trading activities have emerged during the recent past, the co-operative sector mainly handled items distributed under the Food Stamp Scheme as well as basic consumer items such as rice, flour and sugar which have relatively low profit margins. According to estimates based on Central Bank Surveys, gross profits of the co\u00adoperatives decreased from 6 per cent in 1982 to 5 per cent in 1983 despite an increase in their turnover from Rs. 8,320 million in 1982 to Rs. 9,300 million in 1983. As this margin of profit was too low to compensate for the increased transport cost and other administrative expenses, the co-operative sector faced serious financial diffi\u00adculties during the year. This was despite the availability of credit facilities from the",

Co-operative societies played a valuable role in averting shortages of basic consumer and other essential items and ensuring their equitable distribution. The service that the co\u00adoperative sector extended to consumers by expeditiously extending and intensifying their distribution and marketing network during this time is noteworthy even in the context of a liberalised economy. In the circumstances, the need to facilitate and improve their performance by providing adequate finance, training and other incentives to make them commercially viable, should receive due recognition.",

Judged in terms of indicators such as the number of arrivals, earnings, hotel occupancy or employment, the performance of this sector in 1983 was sub-normal. The most glaring reason for the low level of activity was the July disturbances. In addition, the economic situation in Western Europe (which is our main tourist generating market) was still sluggish as many nations were in a state of transition from recession into recovery with no tangible benefits trickling down to Sri Lanka.",

    "text": "Foreign exchange earnings from tourism in 1983 slumped to become only the sixth highest foreign exchange inflow into Sri Lanka in comparison with the fourth place it occupied in 1982 . Tourist arrivals in 1983 declined by 17 per cent compared . with the previous year and stood at 337,342. This was the first time since 1971, that the positive trend in tourist traffic growth was reversed even though the rate of growth in tourist arrivals, has been declining over the past few years. The effect of the July disturbances on arrival figures is clearly evident by the fact that during the first six months of 1983 tourist arrivals increased by 10 per cent compared with the same period of the previous year but decreased by 45 per cent for the latter six months. However, another factor worth noting is that arrivals in June, 1983 were lower than those in the corresponding month in 1982 and this was due to the decline in the number of arrivals from India as a result of the restrictions imposed by the Indian Government on the duty-free allowance afforded to its nationals. Arrivals, from Western Europe and Australasia recorded the highest negative growth rates during the year and decreased by 24 and 22 per cent respectively. Arrivals from Asia dec\u00adlined by 8 per cent. This was mainly due to a drop in Indian tourists by 6 per cent. Arrivals from North America dropped by 5 per cent. Arrivals from Eastern Europe however, increased by 7 per cent during, the year under review. Arrivals o f \" ex\u00adcursionists \" (temporary visitors staying in the country for less than 24 hours exclu\u00adding travellers in transit) totalled 8,836 in 1983 compared with 6,632 in 1982 recording an increase of 33 per cent.",
