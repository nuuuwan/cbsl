    "text": "Tea production in 1983, provisionally estimated at 179.3 million kgs., was the lowest recorded since 1956 and indicated a decline of 8.5 million kgs. or 4.5 per cent when compared with 1982. The fall in production was evident in. all three elevational categories with low grown areas showing the lowest decline of 1.4 million kgs. (2.2' per cent). Production in high grown and medium grown areas fell by 3.9 million kgs. (5.4 per cent) and 3.2 million kgs. (6.2 per cent), respectively. Accor\u00adding to the Tea Board, production (excluding production from bought leaf) on the .estates owned by the Janatha Estates Development Boards (JEDBs), fell by 5.6 million kgs. (8.2 per cent) while that of the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporations (SLSPCs) fell by 4.3 million kgs. (7.5 per cent) when compared with the production in 1982. Tea production from bought leaf by the JEDBs and the SLSPCs fell by 0.6 ' million kgs. (9.7 per cent) and 1.6 million kgs. (12.4 per cent), respectively. However, tea production from bought leaf and own leaf on private sector estates increased by 2.8 million kgs. and 0.3 million kgs, respectively. Thus, a noteworthy feature of the production decline was that it was confined to the major state sector corporations, the JEDBs and the SLSPCs. A salient feature of the production decline was that it occurred almost entirely in the second quarter of the year. The fall in total production was mainly due to the combined effect of the severe drought conditions which prevailed throughout the first half of the year and the resultant decrease in fertilizer application during this period. Perhaps, private sector producers have resorted to coarse plucking to take advantage of more attractive prices during the year. This may be particularly true of smallholders.",

Except for the sharp fall in the second quarter during which the drought was most severe the fertilizer issues increased during the other quarters of the year. Fertilizer application on estates managed by the JEDBs rose by 1,706 metric tons (5 per cent) while that on estates managed by the SLSPCs rose by 1,130 metric tons (3 per cent) when compared with the previous year. The available data tend to indicate that the fertilizer usage on private sector estates increased considerably. The increase in total fertilizer issues to the public sector as well as the private sector tea plantations was the combined result of the improved producer margins and favourable weather conditions experienced during the second half of 1983.",

While an acceleration of the pace of replanting is vital to the long-term viability of the tea industry, infilling of vacancies also deserves greater emphasis owing to the fact that infilling, unlike replanting, does not have adverse effects on production in the short run. This is particularly important because decrease in bush density has been identified as one of the major reasons for the drop in productivity during the recent past. In this regard, the increase in infilling sub\u00adsidy in November, 1983 from Rs. 2/- per plant to Rs. 4/- per plant may be considered an important measure.",

However, the proportionate increase in prices was large enough to more than offset the adverse effects of COP increase on producer margins during the year.

The increase in production stemmed from the improvement in average yield which was a result of the intensive tapping of rubber trees in the private sector.

However, rubber prices increased during the year to such levels as would raise producer margins to a significant extent. All categories of producers, public sector estates, private sector estates and small\u00adholders, appear to have benefitted from the increase. The producer margins of the SLSPCs for which data are available for 1983 are estimated to have increased from 38 cents per kg. in 1982 to Rs. 4.60 per kg. in 1983. Judging by the relative levels of productivity and cost structures within the two sectors, private estates and small\u00adholders would have experienced much better margins than the public sector during the year.",

The subsidy payments for reha\u00adbilitation amounted to Rs. 3.2 million in 1983. The total extent underplanted and replanted during the year also dropped by 25 per cent to 2,641 hectares. The subsidy payment for the purpose decreased from Rs. 13.0 million in 1982 to Rs. 9.6 million in 1983. This relatively poor performance in rehabilitation and underplanting and replanting during the year reflects the impact of the prolonged drought during the first half of the year. In order to arrest the decline in replanting and underplanting, the subsidy rate for the purpose was raised in November, 1983 from Rs. 7,400 to Rs. 12,000 per hectare.

As a result, the extraction of oil is inefficient and the average residual oil content of poonac is estimated around 13 per cent. With high pressure expellers and proper maintenance the oil content of poonac may be reduced to about 6-8 per cent, which will result in higher oil pro\u00adduction and poonac with a better keeping quality.

Though the open market price continued to be above the guaranteed price as in the previous year, the spread between the open market price and the guaranteed price appears to have narrowed during the first half of 1983 when compared with the spread which prevailed during the same period last year. The average open market price of paddy for the first half and second half of 1983 has been estimated at Rs. 71.00 and Rs. 79.00, respectively. Relatively, higher open market price in the second half reflects the shortfall in Yala harvest. Besides the lower spread referred to above, the high cost of carrying stocks over and extended period may also have contributed to the reduced role of the private sector in purchasing paddy during the first half of the year. .",

This-policy change was a direct consequence of the high stock of paddy which the PMB was unable to dispose of at a profit and also a result of the higher unit cost involved in direct purchases at the farmgate (about Rs. 71 per bushel).

Issues to the rubber sector showed an increase in all quarters, but the highest increase was in the fourth quarter. Issues to the coconut sector fell in the first half of the year and rose sharply in the second half with improved weather conditions and better nut prices, to more than offset the fall in the first half. For paddy an increase, if only marginal, is reported in the first half of the year, but a decline in the balance part of the year (a feature noticed in the previous year too). This resulted in the annual intake remaining more or less the same as in 1982. The overall picture of the fertilizer issues to various crops in 1983 by quarters seems to indicate a very uneven pattern. This may have been partly due to the impact of the weather conditions being felt on different crop sectors differently. The price changes of various fertilizer components announced in May, 1983 and stock position of respective crop sectors at the time of the announcement of the price increase may also have influenced this uneven distri\u00adbution of fertilizer issues by quarters.",

Since mechanized craft account for about 70 per cent of the coastal fish production the increase in fuel cost appears to have had an adverse effect on production. However, in view of the apparent increase in producer prices of fish, and the large amount of funds being invested in the coastal fisheries sector under several special projects such as the North West Coast-Fishery Development Project and the West Coast Fishery Development Projects it is doubtful whether the poor performance in the coastal fisheries sector can be explained solely in terms of higher fuel costs.

The data indicate that the People's Bank recovered Rs. 36.5 million or 72 per cent of its Maha, 1982/83 paddy loans. This is a significant improvement when compared with the recovery rate of 42 per cent reported for its Maha, 1981/82 paddy loans in the previous year. The Bank of Ceylon was able to recover Rs. 29.9 million or 67 per cent of the paddy loans granted for Maha, 1982/83 which was more or less the same recovery rate as last year. The Hatton National Bank reported a better recovery rate of 88 per cent of the Maha paddy loans by the end of December, 1983 but with a relatively lower amount of credit granted. Never\u00adtheless, when compared with its own record in the previous year during which it was able to recover only 71 per cent of the Maha, 1981/82 paddy loans the recovery rate in 1983 may be considered an improvement.",
