Revenue from taxes, increased by 34 per cent to Rs. 20,700 million, while non-tax revenue increased by 89 per cent to Rs. 4,510 million. The sharp increase in the non-tax revenue was primarily caused by the transfer of Central Bank profits to the Treasury under Section 39 of the Monetary Law Act. Higher collections from turnover taxes, import duties and tea tax contributed to the sharp increase in tax revenue. Total revenue and non-tax revenue exclusive of the transfer of Central Bank profit indicated increases of 33 per cent and 26 per cent respectively, over the previous year.",

The reversal of the trend was caused largely by the increased revenue receipts arising from the wider coverage of imports, the increases in import duties and turnover tax as well as due to higher tax collections from tea and rubber on account of higher prices. The improvement in the Government tax revenue perfor\u00admance was also reflected in the increase in the buoyancy co-efficient of tax revenue, which according to tentative calculations shot up from 0.479 in 1982 to 1.545 in 1983. The high buoyancy in revenue experienced during the year could be a transitory phenomenon caused by increased tax rates, wider coverage and favourable price developments in the primary commodity markets which may not be of a sustained nature. Total revenue exclusive of the transfer of Central Bank profits in relation to GDP increased from 18 per cent to 19 per cent. Total revenue/GDP ratio for 1983 stood at 21 per cent.",

However, when the Central Bank transfer of profits is exclu\u00added from government revenue, the relative share of both categories remained almost unchanged in 1983 . As in the past, indirect taxes formed a major source of tax revenue accounting for nearly 81 per cent in comparison to 78 per cent in 1982, reflecting a greater reliance on indirect taxes for the purpose of raising and main\u00adtaining government revenue. Indirect taxes during the year increased by 39 per cent and this was largely due to higher collections from increased turnover taxes, import duties and tea taxes.",

Confirming the trend observed in the recent past, the relative decline was mainly caused by a decrease in the export duty collections from tea, where duty is levied on the volume of exports. As compared with the previous year, specific export duty receipts from tea at Rs. 1,290 million indicated a decrease of 11 per cent in spite of an increase in the duty rates in July, 1983. This decrease was caused by a 13 per cent drop in the volume of tea exports. In case of rubber, despite a downward revision in the ad-valorem based sliding scale duty and a fall in export volume by 5 per cent, the total revenue collection increased by 13 per cent over 1982 owing to favourable export prices. The total export duty on rubber amounted to Rs. 852 million in 1983. Export duty on coconut kernel products amounted to Rs. 241 million, recording an increase of 26 per cent over the last year.

Nevertheless, it is to be noted that advance account activities once again reverted to be an important user of budgetary resources, accounting for nearly 4 per cent of revenue receipts for 1983. Advance account activities of government departments, resulted in a net out-payment of Rs. 416 million. Major out-payments were in respect of the Food Commissioner (Rs. 105 million), Railway (Rs. 69 milhon), Principal Collector of Customs (Rs. 52 million), Marketing Department (Rs. 14 million) and Difference in Exchange Account (Rs. 43 million). The latter was only an accounting adjustment connected with the finalization of the Ceylon/China Trade Account where the net out-payment was related to losses on exchange rate differentials retained in suspense pending charges to appropriate agencies or departments. A sum of Rs. 420 milhon advanced to the National Textile Corporation classified under Loans from Advance Accounts and Surplus Balances greatly affected the final outturn in the advance accounts operation during the year. Of this, Rs. 415 million was on account of the settlement of the Corporation's debt to the People's Bank. However, it is understood that the Bank has re-channelled these loan repayments back to the Government through the purchase of rupee securities. Within this broad category of advances other major net out -payments were in respect of the Sri Lanka Insurance Cor\u00adporation (Rs. 50 milhon), the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation (Rs. 35 milhon), the Sri Lanka Central Transport Board (Rs. 25 milhon) and Public Officers' 'B' Account (Rs. 62 milhon). In this category there were major net in-payments from the National Water Supply & Drainage Board (Rs. 72 million), the Paddy Marketing Board (Rs. 61 million) and the National Housing Development Authority (Rs. 25 milhon).

Resources of the Sinking Funds were invested in Urban Development Authority debentures amounting to Rs. 300 million and in State Mortgage and Investment Bank's debentures amounting to Rs. 50 million. The higher level of investments by the Sinking Funds in 1983 was due to increased, level of investible resources arising from an increase in government contributions to sinking funds and the higher level of income from its investments. The Government contributions to sinking funds at Rs. 3,561 million indicated almost a two-fold increase over the previous year. Income from investments during, the year amounted to Rs. 1,368 million as compared to Rs. 947 million in 1982.- On account of the policy decision taken to discontinue with the maintenance of sinking funds for rupee loans, the Government will not be required to contribute to sinking funds for repayment purposes with effect from January, 1984 either oh loans issued prior to January, 1984 or on hew loan issues. The accounting arrangements should not conceal the Underlying fact that Sinking Funds merely re-channelled government resources to the budget by subscriptions to rupee loans, and to the Urban Develop\u00adment Authority and the State Mortgage & Investment Bank through subscriptions to their debentures. These operations also inflated the Government expenditure and the amount of outstanding gross domestic debt.",
