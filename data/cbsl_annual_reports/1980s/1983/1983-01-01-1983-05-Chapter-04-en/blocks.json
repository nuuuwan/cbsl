The total output of public sector.industrial enterprises excluding the Petroleum Cor\u00adporation indicated a decrease of 7 per cent in the year under review. Among them, the. Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation recorded a decrease of 41 per cent mainly due to the shut-down of its factory for repairs and on account of production problems. The decline in the production level of the Sri Lanka Cement Corporation (by 9 per cent) was mostly the result of the closure of its kilns owing to the short supply of clinker. The State Distilleries Corporation and the National Milk Board recorded decreases of 32 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. This was mainly due to the shortage of inputs as.'a result of the unprecedented drought conditions that prevailed during the year. The production of the National Salt Corporation and the State Mining and Mineral Development Corporation declined by 30 per cent each in 1983. Among the corporations that recorded improved levels of output were the State Timber (21 per cent), Ceylon Oils and Fats (16 percent) and Ceylon Mineral Sands (10 per cent).",

    "text": "With the economic reforms of 1977 and the dismantling of the regulatory struc\u00adture that previously existed, the favoured status hitherto enjoyed by public sector enterprises was discontinued and they were placed on the same competitive footing as private enterprises. They were required to operate on a commercially viable basis and generate their own funds or resort to competitive commercial borrowing for development purposes. However, it is observed that the general level of profita\u00adbility of the public sector manufacturing enterprises has declined in recent years. Their aggregate financial results showed a profit of Rs. 679 million in 1980 but in the subsequent two years overall losses amounted to Rs. 241 million and Rs. 555 million respectively. Emphasis has been placed recently on financial viability, checking wastage and enforcing cost saving measures as a step towards arresting this situation.",
