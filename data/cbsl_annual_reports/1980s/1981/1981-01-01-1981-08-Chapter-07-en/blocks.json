Compared with an increase of 26 per cent in 1980, the index rose by only 18 per cent in 1981. On a point to point basis as well the index showed the same increase in December, 1981 over the corresponding month of the previous year. This deceleration in price increases has been the combined outcome of a less expansionary fiscal policy, a restrictive monetary policy and a lower rate of increase in import prices.",

A further analysis of the index disclosed that the upward revision of prices of rice, wheat flour and bread accounted for 49 per cent of the increase in the index. The balance 51 per cent reflected the impact of price increases in other items.",

Of the increase in the Wholesale Price Index, 64 per cent was due to the increase in the prices of items in the domestic group, while 36 per cent was due to that in the import group. The prices of locally produced export commodities did not feature significantly in the increase of the Wholesale Price Index in 1981.",

However, in the unorganised sectors such as paddy and building construction there was an increase of wages in real terms.",
