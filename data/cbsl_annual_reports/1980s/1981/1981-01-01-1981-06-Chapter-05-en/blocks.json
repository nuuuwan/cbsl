The depreciation of the rupee appeared to have contributed largely to the growth in oil import bill in rupee terms in the year under review. For example, in 1981 the average price per barrel of crude oil imported by Sri Lanka rose by 11 per cent in U.S. Dollar terms, whereas it increased by 29 per cent in rupee terms. The value of oil imports, represented 25 per cent of the country's total imports in 1981, compared with 24 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile, the export of petroleum products declined marginally in U.S. Dollar terms notwithstanding its modest increase revealed in rupee terms. Netting the value of petroleum exports from the cost of such imports, the domestic consumption of petroleum can be estimated at Rs. 5,252 million amoun\u00adting to 15 per cent of the total import expenditure or 26 per cent of the total export earnings of Sri Lanka in 1981.",

    "text": "The domestic prices of petroleum products were adjusted upwards by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in early 1981 consequent to an increase in the oil price by the OPEC. The new price structure also aimed at rationalizing the consumption of different products such as kerosene, auto-diesel and heavy diesel. Although the policy of cross-subsidization was abandoned in general, the price of a gallon of petrol was raised further to a much higher level than its unit cost of produc\u00adtion, whereas the price of a gallon of kerosene was kept well below its unit cost. The impact of the new price structure was either to reduce the levels of consumption in absolute terms or to contain their rates of increase to marginal amounts. For instance, despite the fact that kerosene was sold at a price below cost and Kerosene Stamps were made available to subsidize its consumption by the poorer segments of the country, the sales of kerosene have dropped by more than 10 per cent in 1981. The consumption of petrol however, remained more or less static despite a 14 per cent price hike effected in two stages during the year. Compared with a 14 per cent growth rate observed in 1980, there was a deceleration in the consumption of auto diesel in 1981 as it grew by only 5 per cent in view of a price increase of 28 per cent. The demand for heavy diesel however, rose by an unprecedented rate of 67 per cent in 1981 mainly reflecting the requirements resulting from increased resort to gas turbines by the Ceylon (CEB) Electricity Board to generate power. In general, the restraints on demand imposed by price increases might have been offset to some extent by the energy needs stemming from the higher level of economic activity in 1981. The energy pricing policy, therefore does not appear to have drastically hindered the pace of industrial, commercial, transportation and other energy intensive activities of the economy.",

    "text": "With the commissioning of three additional gas turbines in the course of 1981, the installed capacity of the CEB totalled 501 megawatts reflecting an enhancement of 19 per cent compared with the previous year's capacity. However, due to the drought conditions that existed in the catchment area coupled with the rapid growth in demand for electricity, the CEB was compelled to impose power-cuts ranging from five to eight hours from time to time mainly during the first half of the year. Neverthe\u00adless, the total sales of electricity in 1981 recorded a growth rate similar to what was observed in the previous year increasing by 6 per cent to 1,482 million kWh. As in the previous year, the highest growth rate in consumption of electricity was recorded by the domestic sector thereby raising its relative share in the total consumption to more than 14 per cent. The industrial sector which exhibited a negative growth rate in electricity consumption in 1980, reflected a 6 per cent increase in the year under review which enabled it to maintain its relative share of consumption at 45 per cent of the total. Presumably, the commercial sector experienced a 3 per cent reduction in its electricity consumption from the national grid due to the use of generators during the power-cuts in 1981. The overall pattern of electricity consumption by sectors however, did not reveal significant changes in the year under review.",

The rising cost of petroleum products, increasing expenditure on maintenance and growing operating losses of the public sector trans\u00adport agencies, compelled them to pass on at least, a portion of the enhanced financial burden to the users of transport services by way of increasing bus and railway fares in 1979 and 1980. In 1981, however, there were no fare increases effected by the public transport agencies; instead the approach was to initiate cost-saving devices in the operations. Furthermore, the incentives and facilities granted to the private sector road hauliers and omnibus operators appeared to have assisted the efforts of the public transport agencies in maintaining an adequate service as well as in stabi\u00adlizing the transportation charges.",

It was, however, expected that the private omnibus operators were capable of supplementing the SLCTB's services in many routes. The operated kilometerage of the SLCTB reflected a 4.5 per cent drop from 517 million in 1980 to 493 million in 1981. Total strength of the bus fleet of the SLCTB stood at 7,192 in 1981 as against 7,511 in 1980 reflecting the low rate of replacement of discarded buses. The number of new buses registered by the SLCTB in 1981 was only 24 compared with 788 in the previous year. The passenger kilometerage handled by the SLCTB in 1981 at 13,785 million was 30 per cent lower than what was recorded in the year before. Accordingly, the load factor was reduced from 71 per cent in 1980 to 52 per cent in 1981.",

The operated kilo\u00admeterage of the CGR declined by nearly 9 per cent in 1981, while its passenger kilo\u00admeterage dropped sharply by 21 per cent. The marked preference of commuters to travel by bus, particularly in the context of a rapidly growing private omnibus transport sector offering both short and long distance services at competitive fares, might have contributed to the decline in the demand for travel by train. In the case of goods transport, however, the railway appeared to have maintained a satisfactory level in 1981, compared with the performance in 1980. As against a drop of more than 26 per cent experienced in the cargo ton kilometerage in 1980, the provisional estimate for 1981 reveals only a modest increase of 8 per cent. The competitive rates offered by the CGR for goods transport and the introduction of better facilities such as containers for cargo appeared to have arrested a further decline in the demand for goods transport by rail.",

Hence, the new registration of all types of vehicles at the Department of Motor Traffic dropped in 1981 in comparison with the numbers for 1980. Next to the decline of the new registration of SLCTB buses which dropped by 97 per cent, the biggest reduction was seen in the case of motor cycles which decreased by 51 per cent. New Registration of the private coaches and vans which reflected a growth of 69 per cent in 1980, recorded a 12 per cent decline in 1981. Similarly, lorries and other vehicles for goods transport showed a 16 per cent reduction in terms of new registrations in 1981, compared with an increase of 48 per cent in the previous year. These trends indicated the gradual tapering off of the level of demand for import of vehicles, which rose to unprecedented levels soon after import and exchange liberalization policies were introduced in late 1977.",

The physical progress in terms of different types of housing activity indicated an impressive performance, particularly, in respect of the Rural Housing Programme. The number of units completed under this programme as at end 1981, amounted to 14,767, reflecting an increase of about 70 per cent compared with its level of achievement an year ago. Furthermore, 15,454 units under this programme were under construction during 1981. Accordingly, the number of already completed units and the number of units being completed as at end of 1981 totalled 30,221, accounting for 60 per cent of the final target of 50,000 units under the Rural Housing Programme. There were three main components of this programme, namely Aided Self-Help (ASH) type, Model Villages and Fisheries Houses, which were almost exclusively aimed at catering to the housing needs of the rural poor. In view of the beneficiary group and also due to the relatively low cost nature of these types, the Rural Housing Programme appeared to have received the highest priority in 1981.",

The needed adjustments in the overall public sector housing programme should most logically be made in this category.

Nearly one-half of the approvals in 1981 reflected additions and alterations which recorded an increase of 16 per cent in comparison with the figure for 1980. Meanwhile, the number of approvals in respect of new construction of houses, flats, commercial and industrial buildings together showed a drop of 11 per cent in 1981. The reduction in the cons\u00adtruction of new buildings could be mainly attributed to the cumulative effect of the price increases in building materials such as cement, iron, steel, timber and glass. The lack of buildable land as well as the exorbitant land prices in the Colombo Municipality area also contributed heavily to this situation. Therefore, it was not unlikely that the location of construction activity, in terms of new buildings for both residential and industrial purposes, shifted to the sub-urban areas away from the Colombo Municipality area. While the rate of growth of new construction slowed down, that of additions and alterations increased in the Colombo Municipality area in 1981 reflecting the tendency to both economize on land use and modernize the existing facilities. However, housing and construction activity undertaken by the private sector in 1981, indicated a levelling off of the high rate of activity experienced in this sector during the past two years.",
