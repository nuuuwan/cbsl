This was un\u00adattractive to participating credit institutions and as a result there was some reluctance among commercial banks to make use of the export refinancing facility. Con\u00adsequently, in the course of 1981 commercial banks filed only 14 applications, although the Sri Lanka Export Development Board granted export industry status to about 40 enterprises.

In order to induce the commercial banks to participate actively in this scheme, the Central Bank agreed to provide 100 per cent refinance facilities to export projects approved by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board. Following this revision, the amended terms and conditions relating to refinance facilities under the different categories of the MLCF were as follows :",

For the administration of this scheme the NDB received a line of credit from the IDA through the Government of Sri Lanka amounting to US $ 16 million. Of this amount US $ 12 million was set aside to assist the participating credit institutions (Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, the DFCC, Hatton National Bank Ltd., the Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited) with refinance facilities upto 80 per cent of the loans disbursed for SMI Projects, while the Central Bank issued guarantees to cover these loans upto 60 per cent of such loans.",

    "text": "The Board held four meetings during the year 1981. Major policy changes affecting rural credit operations of the banking system were accepted for implemen\u00adtation. It was decided to reschedule existing loans given to farmers during the period 1st January, 1977 to 30th June, 1981. The rescheduling scheme proposed by the Rural Credit Advisory Board offers a measure of relief to the farmers and an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves and thereby become eligible for fresh loans. The scheme provides for all the loans granted during the period referred to above to be consolidated to form one loan. In the consolidation of these loans no penal interest will be charged. Interest will be added on the outstanding up to 30th June, 1981 at 9 per cent rate of interest. The farmers who wish to make use of this oppor\u00adtunity will be requested to pay 10 per cent of the consolidated loan and the balance in 10 half yearly instalments spread over a period of 5 years. Each loan instalment will be related to a 'kanna'. In areas where double cropping is not possible due to lack of water, banks may consider giving an extended repayment period not exceeding 10 years. On repayment of the first 7 instalments on the due dates, the farmers will be given a concession of a write-off of the last three instalments due on the consolidated loan as an incentive to promote regular repayments. Those farmers who do not wish to use this scheme to rehabilitate themselves will be considered as wilful defaul\u00adters and legal action will be taken against them to recover these loans. Also, the bank managers have been given the discretion to refuse the rescheduling facility to any farmer who in their opinion, may be considered a wilful defaulter of existing loans, i.e. a farmer who has the capacity to repay, but is not inclined to honour his commitments to the bank. Under the scheme if a farmer is accepted for rescheduling by the bank, he also becomes eligible for a fresh loan under the Comprehensive Agri\u00adcultural Credit Scheme of the two state banks to meet the cost of cultivation of Yala 1982. This scheme was introduced by Bank of Ceylon in September, 1981 in the districts of Mannar, Mulaitivu and Anuradhapura to coincide with the Maha season. The scheme is expected to be introduced islandwide to coincide with Yala 1982.",
