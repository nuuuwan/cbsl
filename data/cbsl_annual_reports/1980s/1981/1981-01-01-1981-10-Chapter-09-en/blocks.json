    "text": "The package of economic reforms introduced since late 1977 envisaged a sharp expansion of trade. In the year under review, imports and exports as a per\u00adcentage of Gross National Product remained high, at 46 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively. These compared with 17 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively in 1977. The changes witnessed in the pattern of imports and exports in 1981 indicate a further consolidation of the initial success of the policies adopted for making trade an important agent of development. The policy reforms envisaged a rapid expansion of the export sector and a gradual deceleration in imports after the initial outburst in imports to support the accelerated development programme, partially financed from foreign sources. As anticipated, exports grew at a faster rate of 11 per cent in 1981 compared to 8 per cent in 1980 in more stable SDR terms, while on the other hand, the rate of growth of imports which recorded a 41 per cent increase in 1980, showed a marginally negative growth in 1981 in SDR terms.",

Consequently, the trade deficit registered was Rs. 14,845 million (SDR 655 million) which was 9 per cent lower than the previous year's trade deficit of Rs. 16,364 million (SDR 761 million). When Customs data are adjusted to present a more realistic picture, the total expenditure on imports amounted to Rs. 35,251 million (SDR 1,555 million) and total earnings from exports were Rs. 20,585 million (SDR 908 million), resulting in a trade deficit of Rs. 14,666 million (SDR 647 million) for the year. This compares somewhat favourably with the previous year's adjusted trade deficit of Rs. 16,347 million (SDR 760 million). The major factor responsible for the adverse balance in the trade account in 1981 was the inadequate growth of exports while import expenditure remained stable at the high level reached in the previous year.",

    "text": "The earnings from exports (adjusted data) in 1981 at Rs. 20,585 million (SDR 908 million) registered an increase of Rs. 2,990 million or 17 per cent in rupee terms (SDR 90 million or 11 per cent) over the previous year. Earnings from agricultural and industrial exports recorded sharp increases both in rupee as well as in SDR terms, while those from mineral exports recorded a decline. Following the pattern in recent years, the share of agricultural exports in total earnings declined further to 59 per cent in 1981 from 62 per cent in the preceding year. On the other hand, the relative im\u00adportance of industrial exports increased. The rates of growth of agricultural and industrial exports during the year were 11 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively as compared with 1 per cent and 52 per cent in 1980. Mineral exports, which accounted for 4 per cent of total earnings, registered a decline of 4 per cent, as against an increase of 27 per cent in the previous year. In the category of agricultural exports, earnings from tea, rubber, coconut kernel products and minor agricultural crops increased, while those from coconut by-products decreased. The value of tea exports however declined marginally in SDR terms. The relative significance of tra\u00additional plantation crop sector in total exports decreased from 57 per cent in 1980 to 52 per cent in 1981. Exports earnings from petroleum products and textiles and garments in 1981 were higher than those of rubber and coconut products, which traditionally figure as the country's second and third largest foreign exchange earners. Tea exports however continued to be the principal single item of export, accounting for 31 per cent of the total value of exports.",

The increase in value was due partly to an increase in the volume of exports, the effect of which was strengthened by a marginal increase in the f.o.b. price from Rs. 21.42 per Kg. in 1980 to Rs. 21.84 per Kg. in 1981. The volume of rubber exports increased by 12 million Kgs. to 133 million Kgs. in 1981. However, during the year rubber exporters were faced with the problem of accumulating large stocks of rubber due to sharp declines in prices in international markets, which resulted from a lack of demand following the recession in Western industrialized countries and the United States. The Inter\u00adnational Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) which became effective in 1981 appears to have had no significant impact on the stabilization of natural rubber prices. Rubber prices in the Colombo market, particularly the prices of RSS grades, decli\u00adned causing serious marketing problems to rubber smallholders. Natural rubber purchases by the People's Republic of China under the Sri Lanka-China Rubber Agreement have declined over the years and the Protocol for 1981 provided for the purchase of only 20,000 metric tons as against 30,000 metric tons in the preceding year.",

This was entirely the result of an increase of Rs. 257 million in the export earnings from coconut kernel products, the effect of which was to some extent offset by a decrease of Rs. 53 million in the earnings from coconut by-products. The unsatisfactory export performance of the coconut sector in 1980 was reversed and coconut exports have shown significant increases since the removal of restrictions in August, 1981. Following the liberalization of coconut exports, the export volumes of the major coconut products viz. desiccated coconut, coconut oil and copra, increased markedly. In terms of nut equivalent, the volume of exports of coconut kernel products increased substantially from 239 million nuts in 1980 to 401 million nuts in 1981 or by 67 per cent. Earnings from the export of coconut oil and desiccated coconut recorded increases, in 1981, despite decreases in their average f.o.b. prices. Even though the prices of coconut by-products moved favourably during the year, the benefits of higher export prices could not be realised owing to reductions in the export volumes that were caused mostly by bottle\u00adnecks in supply.",

Although export earnings from these two items (garments and petroleum products) have increased considerably, accounting for a major share of total export earnings, the import content of garments and petroleum exports is fairly high. Thus, the net foreign exchange earnings from these exports are much lower than those of other exports (i.e. agricultural and mineral exports).

Increased export earnings from textiles and garments, minor agricultural exports and other industrial exports were largely responsible for the favourable rate of growth in exports during 1981. During the year, industrial exports grew at an appreciable rate of 29 per cent. On the other hand, increased earnings in rupee terms from exports during the year were partly due to the deprecia\u00adtion of the Sri Lanka Rupee against some major currencies. Although export prices of most products moved favourably in the international markets, they were not in keeping with the global rate of inflation. It is observed that over the years, import prices have been rising faster than export prices, resulting in a marked deterioration in the country's terms of trade. Moreover, if the growing demand for imports is to be maintained there is a pressing need to increase the rate of growth of exports which could be achieved through diversification and development of non-traditional exports, while improving the viability of traditional exports.",

This was in marked contrast to an increase of 51 per cent (41 per cent in SDR terms) in 1980. The increase in the value of imports was the result of a significant increase in import prices as measured by the Import Price Index while there was only a marginal increase in the volume of imports (as measured by the Import Volume Index). The structural change in the composition of imports observed in the recent past continued in the year under review, greater share being absorbed by the import of raw materials. Following previous year's trends, the share of consumer goods in total imports decreased further from 30 per cent to 26 per cent. While the share of investment goods declined marginally to 23 per cent from 24 per cent an year earlier, that of intermediate goods increased from 46 per cent to 51 per cent. The increase in expenditure on intermediate goods could be attributed partly to the shift in imports from wheat flour (classified as a consumer good) to wheat grain (classified as an intermediate good) with the com\u00admencement of the Prima Mills, and partly to the rapid increase in expenditure on petroleum imports resulting from upward revisions in the price of crude oil.",

The Central Bank provided 100 per cent refinance to the commercial banks and other credit institutions at 10 per cent and lli per cent interest in respect of loans granted for projects related to the promotion and development of exports. Further, a sum of Rs. 530 million was also made available to be lent for pre-shipment refinance at a rate of interest of 12 per cent to the commercial banks to enable them to maintain a reasonably low on-lending rate of 16 per cent, in the context of somewhat sharp increases in commercial bank lending rates: Of the total credit availability from the banking system, the highest percentage share, viz. 17 per cent, was for export trading in 1981. As far as imports were concerned, banks were requested to give priority for financing capital goods, raw materials and essential consumer goods.",

Its main activities involved identifying the constraints in the supply of exports, strengthening export services and providing incentives and assistance for the development of exports. The Export Development Council of Ministers decided to allow the private sector to engage in mining, proces\u00adsing and export of the mineral resources, ending the state sector monopoly in this activity. An Advisory Committee was appointed, with public and private sector representatives to prepare a National Export Development Plan as required by the Sri Lanka Export Development Act No. 40 of 1979. Using the resources of the Export Development Fund, the Board decided to participate in the equity of eight export oriented projects, with a view to help mobilising resources for such projects. With effect from 1st March, 1981 the system of export documentation was simplified to facilitate the entire export trade. A number of procedural improve\u00adments were made in the new Customs Duty Rebate Scheme, to make it more effective. A total of Rs. 27 million worth of Export Expansion Grants were paid in respect of 463 returns finalised. A scheme of Presidential Export Awards and Certificates of Merit to exporters for outstanding performances was also launched. With the assis\u00adtance of UNCTAD and GATT, 7 specific product areas were identified and given assistance for export development and promotion. These include jewellery, white and brown coir fibre, handloom products, rubber products, tea bags and packets, marine products and horticultural products. As an institutional support for export promo\u00adtion, a Trade and Shipping Information Service was established under the Ministry of Trade and Shipping. The concept of production for export at the village level was introduced and demonstrated at the model export village in the Dambadeniya elec^ torate. This village has exported in 1981 approximately Rs. 145,000 worth of betel leaves and tea packs made of reed.",

This has enabled the exporters to effect shipments to new markets and new buyers as well as to increase exports to existing clients on credit terms. The incentive granted to exporters under the Inland Revenue Act continued during the year 1981. These included tax holidays and exemptions from income tax on profits and incomes of certain export activities as well as concessions to investors in shares in export ventures.

However, certain exports were subjected to pre-export quality inspections. The year also saw the active participation of the private sector in the rubber export trade. The export duty on tea was further reduced in November, 1981 from Rs. 10.50 to Rs. 8.00 per Kg. for bulk tea and from Rs. 8.50 to Rs. 6.50 per Kg. for packeted tea with a view to assisting the producers to obtain a better profit margin. In addition, with a view to providing relief to tea producers in the context of rising cost of production, the taxable point of the Ad valorem Sales Tax was revised twice from the monthly average price of Rs. 16.00 per Kg. in March, 1981 to Rs. 22.00 per Kg. in November, 1981 and the rate of taxation was increased from 20 per cent to 35 per cent. Export duties on rubber too were revised downwards twice during the year, partly in lieu of the increase in the cess of 25 cents per Kg. and to promote the exports by moving the accumulated stocks which were at a very high level at the beginning of the year. During the year, the duty on desiccated coconut exports was reduced from Rs. 6,450 to Rs. 3,500 per ton and the export duties on coconut oil and mattress fibre were completely removed, while a sliding scale of duties on the export of all coconut products was introduced in November in order to make them respond automatically to the changes in the international market prices. Further, the administrative levy on coconut products was also removed.",

The number of articles to which the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act was applied increased to 325, while a number of directives were also issued including the banning of ad\u00advertising of infant milk food. Over 1,250 consumer societies were established by the end of the year to promote consumer awareness and restrict malpractices in trade. However, over 2,000 cases had to be filed in courts against violations of the Act. Meanwhile, 9 essential consumer items such as wheat flour, bread, sugar, dhal, milk foods and infant cereal foods continued to be under price control. During the year, a sum of Rs. 140,000 was credited to the Consumer Protection Fund which was to be used for financing consumer education programmes.

More specific decisions need to be taken on the future role of these institutions, if they are to continue to function viably under the new economic environment. The overall performance of many of the trading corporations at the end of 1981 was not satisfactory. Almost all corporations had recorded reduced turnover mainly due to competition from the private sector. However, the restrictions on the volume of credit availability from the banks in 1981, compared to previous years would also have affected the turnover. Meanwhile, many corporations have realised the importance of shifting towards export-oriented activities rather than concentrating on import trade alone e.g. C.W.E.

    "text": "The important role of the co-operative societies in the internal trade mecha\u00adnism of Sri Lanka was a prominent feature since the Second World War. Although the activities and the functions of these societies have changed during the recent past, still the majority of the consumers in the low and middle income groups use them as a major source of supply for their day-to-day needs. It was estimated that the turnover of the co-operative societies in trading activities alone in 1981 increased to Rs. 9,870 million, as compared with Rs. 2,808 million in 1978. This was in spite of a marked increase in the private sector participation in the distribution of essential food items. At the same time, the co-operative sector handled the bulk of the items distributed under the Food Stamp Scheme which amounted to Rs. 1,510 million in 1981. However, during this period the number of employees in the co-operative sector showed a marginal decline and stood at around 41,000. There were nearly 700 wholesale outlets and over 9,000 retail outlets of co-operative societies spread over the country. According to estimates based on a Central Bank Survey, the co-operative sector as a whole has made a 4 per cent margin over the costs of its purchases in 1981.",

    "text": "In recent years, attempts were made to induce greater participation by the pri\u00advate sector in the distribution of essential food items including rice, flour and sugar. By the end of 1981, the private sector was able to handle most of the locally produced rice and entered the rice import trade as well. However, the distribution of flour remained a monopoly of the Food Commissioner's Department (FCD). With the commissioning of the Prima Mills, the FCD imported wheat grain instead of flour to be milled locally for distribution. Meanwhile, the sugar trade underwent a signi\u00adficant change. After several decades of monopoly by the FCD, in 1981 the private sector was permitted to participate in a big way in the import and distribution of sugar, creating in the process certain problems to the FCD. The Colombo North Co-operative Society played an important role in this and was able to increase its turnover to Rs. 426 million in 1981.",
