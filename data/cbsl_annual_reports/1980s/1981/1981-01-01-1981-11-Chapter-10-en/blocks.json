    "text": "The important role of the co-operative societies in the internal trade mecha\u00adnism of Sri Lanka was a prominent feature since the Second World War. Although the activities and the functions of these societies have changed during the recent past, still the majority of the consumers in the low and middle income groups use them as a major source of supply for their day-to-day needs. It was estimated that the turnover of the co-operative societies in trading activities alone in 1981 increased to Rs. 9,870 million, as compared with Rs. 2,808 million in 1978. This was in spite of a marked increase in the private sector participation in the distribution of essential food items. At the same time, the co-operative sector handled the bulk of the items distributed under the Food Stamp Scheme which amounted to Rs. 1,510 million in 1981. However, during this period the number of employees in the co-operative sector showed a marginal decline and stood at around 41,000. There were nearly 700 wholesale outlets and over 9,000 retail outlets of co-operative societies spread over the country. According to estimates based on a Central Bank Survey, the co-operative sector as a whole has made a 4 per cent margin over the costs of its purchases in 1981.",

    "text": "In recent years, attempts were made to induce greater participation by the pri\u00advate sector in the distribution of essential food items including rice, flour and sugar. By the end of 1981, the private sector was able to handle most of the locally produced rice and entered the rice import trade as well. However, the distribution of flour remained a monopoly of the Food Commissioner's Department (FCD). With the commissioning of the Prima Mills, the FCD imported wheat grain instead of flour to be milled locally for distribution. Meanwhile, the sugar trade underwent a signi\u00adficant change. After several decades of monopoly by the FCD, in 1981 the private sector was permitted to participate in a big way in the import and distribution of sugar, creating in the process certain problems to the FCD. The Colombo North Co-operative Society played an important role in this and was able to increase its turnover to Rs. 426 million in 1981.",

    "text": "The Balance of Payments situation showed a considerable improvement in 1981. This development was partly a result of the adoption of appropriate demand management and flexible exchange rate policies. Movements in exchange rates,cur-tailment of the expansion in public sector expenditure and restrictive monetary policies all helped to slow down the rate of increase in the flow of imports during the year. This, together with a noticeable increase in export earnings, contribu\u00adted to contain the trade deficit within manageable levels. Larger inflows on account of transfers in the context of a narrowed trade deficit caused the current account deficit to register a considerable decline compared with 1980. On the other hand, there were larger capital inflows in the form of foreign loans, direct investment and short-term borrowings during the year thereby helping to reduce the overall payments deficit in 1981 to a mere fraction of the substantial deficit experienced in the previous year. Therefore, the use of net external reserves to finance the overall payments deficit was of very modest proportions in 1981.",
