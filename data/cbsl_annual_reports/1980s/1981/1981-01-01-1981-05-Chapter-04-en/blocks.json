    "text": "The main features of the industrial sector in 1981 were a continuous expansion of export oriented industries and poor performance of certain import substitution in\u00addustries resulting mainly from temporary shut-down of factories due to reasons such as power cuts and routine maintenance. Export oriented industries, activated by a steady inflow of foreign investments coupled with participation of foreign collabora\u00adtors, continued to expand. On the other hand, sharp competition arising from the exposure of import substitution industries to imports continued to result in the winding-up of some weak and high cost industrial establishments, particularly the inefficient small enterprises. Power cuts affected industrial output adversely. The shut-down of the oil refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation for repairs and maintenance coincided with this power cut thus intensifying the drop in output.",

This was the lowest rate of industrial growth since 1977. This deceleration of the growth rate largely reflected a decline in the output of petroleum and chemical industries by 5 per cent, on account of the temporary close down of the oil refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in February, 1981, and to that extent could be considered a temporary phenomenon. The overall production was further constrained due to power cuts on account of which certain public sector corporations were compelled to tem\u00adporarily close down their factories.

    "text": "According to a survey of unregistered small-scale industrial establishments* conducted by the Central Bank a considerable number of the enterprises active in 1976 were reported to be inactive in 1981 because of inefficiency caused by high costs leading to marketing difficulties. They were thus unable to face competition from imported substitutes. Their inability to obtain working capital heightened their problems. The most affected industries included those producing handloom textiles, sugarcane jaggery, soap, hand-made paper, fabricated metal products, pottery and cane products. Among the industries which continued to operate at a high level of output in 1981 were rice milling, blacksmithing, lorry body building and brick making. As stressed in the last Annual Report, considering the problems of the small entrepreneur and the advantages flowing from these enterprises through the use of indigenous raw materials and generation of employment, a re-examination of the present tariff structure so as to correctly ascertain the degree of protection afforded to them particularly in their infancy merits some consideration. However, the continuation of any industrial venture should be on economic and not on welfare grounds.",

    "text": "During the year under review, several measures were taken to provide incentives to local manufacturers. One such measure was the extension of the facility of refinan\u00adce from the Central Bank's Medium and Long-term Credit Fund (MLCF) to inclu\u00adde public corporations, to enable them to overcome their financial difficulties. Also in 1981, following the near total utilization of the first Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMI) loan, the National Development Bank negotiated the second loan of US Dollars 30 million from IDA to finance small and medium scale industries in the future years. Import duty on machinery and essential raw materials used in industry was also reduced froml2J% to 5 % with effect from mid-November, 1981. Further, an additional protection to industrialists was accorded by the imposition of a turnover tax on most of the imports over and above the import duty paya\u00adble and the grant of rebate on raw materials imported. In case an imported item is used in the manufacture of goods or commodities in Sri Lanka, the turnover tax paid on the imported item was allowed to be deducted from the turnover tax payable by the manufacturer. Similarly, where a locally manufactured component is used in the manufacture of another item, the turnover tax paid on the component also was allowed to be deducted from the tax payable by the final manufacturer. It is expected that these measures would help in reducing the domestic cost of produc\u00adtion and therefore prices to a certain extent, thereby strengthening their competi\u00adtiveness.",

The escalation of the crude oil prices in the past has contributed to this situation to a large extent. In view of this, the tempo of overall industrial production is closely tied to the economic fortunes of these two industries and could remain so until such time as a more diversified and developed industrial structure is evolved. It should, however, be mentioned that though petroleum products have been recorded to be the first in its contribution to the total gross value of output, these products lagged far behind in their share of the manufacturing value added. As for garment products, though their share was 10 per cent they stood out more significantly in terms of employment.",
