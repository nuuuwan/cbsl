    "text": "The fiscal operations of the Government during the year, 1981 were centred on improving budgetary management. Fiscal adjustments, in order to contain the level of absorption of resources by the Government, were pursued in recognition of the fact that an unduly expansionary fiscal policy would increase the inflationary pressures in the economy and thus negate the beneficial effects of the new economic policies. After the imbalances created by fiscal operations in 1980, prudent demand manage\u00adment policies demanded a scaling down of government expenditure. Even at the time of formulation of the Budget for 1981, a 25 per cent expenditure cut was enforced. In addition, a further reduction of both recurrent and capital expenditure was enforced during the course of the fiscal year. This included a 3 per cent reduction in recurrent expenditure and a 10 per cent reduction in capital expenditure. All on-going and proposed projects were re-phased. On the other hand, the revenue raising efforts of the Government were not relaxed. Improved budgetary management resulted in government's recourse to the banking system being considerably reduced, by as much as forty per cent, as compared with 1980.",

The budget deficit as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed a decline from 24 per cent to 17 per cent. In absolute terms, the deficit decreased from Rs. 16,274 million to Rs. 14,873 million. The current account of the budget still showed a deficit of Rs. 1,382 million, which however, was considerably smaller than in the previous year. The growth of overall government expenditure was contained at 3 per cent, as against 41 per cent in 1980. The total government expenditure as a percentage of the G D P also declined from 46 per cent to 36 per cent. The favourable fiscal developments were mainly in respect of the capital account and to some extent the advance accounts operations.",

Di\u00adversion of savings of the captive sector for investments other than in rupee securi\u00adties and deceleration in the incremental rate of growth in savings with the National Savings Bank (NSB) were primarily responsible for the sharp decrease in finances realised from these sources. Paucity of finance from these sources made the Government resort to financial recourse from the banking sector and to facilitate this process, the Treasury bills limit was raised from Rs. 10 billion to Rs. 18 billion. In 1981,a sum of Rs. 3,917million was obtained from the banking system. With the re-demption of existing rupee loans of the banking system amounting to Rs. 32 million, the expansionary impact of the Government fiscal operations during the year thus amounted to Rs. 3,847 million, as compared with Rs. 7,029 million in 1980.

However, its relative share declined from 26 per cent in the previous year to 23 per cent, on account of a decrease in the incremental growth arising from downward revisions in export duties, aimed at providing favourable producer margins and also due to a higher incremental growth in certain other categories of revenue. On a disaggregated basis, while export duties from rubber and coconut registered 3 per cent and 10 per cent increases, respectively, those from tea recorded a 2 per cent decline. In the case of rubber, despite a downward revision in the sliding scale of duties, the additional duty receipts were mainly due to an increase in the export volume and a marginal increase in the rupee prices (f.o.b.). The increase on duty receipts from coconut was primarily on account of a higher export volume and to some extent due to the operational change effected in the levy of duty with effect from 12th November, 1981. With regard to tea, which is subject to a specific export duty on volume, the decrease was a result of downward revision of the rates of duty. The duty receipts from minor export commodities, amounting to Rs. 133 million, registered an increase of 18 per cent, due to both favourable export prices and higher volumes of export. However, in the case of graphite, increased duty collections were mainly due to higher f.o.b. prices which, despite a 35 per cent drop in export volume, registered a 10 per cent increase in the export value.",

As against last year's revenue and tax coefficients of 0.389 and 0.449, the current year's revenue and tax coefficients were 0.541 and 0.476, respectively.

The outstanding debit balance in the Sri Lanka-China Trade Account increased from Rs. 96million, to Rs. 444 million and accordingly the net-outpayment during the year amounted to Rs. 349 million. The net advances connected with reimbursible capital expenditure amounted to Rs. 574 million. The current account itself would have generated a surplusof Rs. 341 million if not for the net-outpayment of Rs. 1,723 million in the advance accounts. Its share in the current expenditure and total government expenditure however, declined from 24 per cent and 11 per cent in 1980 to 11 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.",

While the external debt service ratio1 increased from 12.4 per cent to 13.4 per cent, the external public debt service ratio showed a marginal increase rising from 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent.",

In comparison, the total issues in 1979 and 1980 amounted to Rs. 2,950 million and Rs. 2,802 million, respectively. This decrease in the issue of rupee securities was due to varied reasons. Resources were pre-empted by semi-government agencies to meet extra budgetary expenditure commitments amounting to Rs. 493 million. The Urban Development Authority (UDA) issued debentures valued at Rs. 433 million, while the State Mortgage and Investment Bank's (SMIB) issues amounted to Rs. 60 million. In addition, savings institutions also changed the investment portfolio by seeking more lucrative sources of investment.",

There were two reasons, namely : a diversification of its investment portfolio and the marked decline in the level of savings mobilized. The NSB invested Rs. 57 million in UDA debentures, while a sum of Rs. 119 million was retained on short-term investments with commercial banks. A further Rs. 74 million was offered in the secondary Treasury bills market. The savings mobilized by the NSB which amounted to Rs. 667 million in 1980 decreased to Rs. 518 million, a decline of 22 per cent. Following these",

The Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka was another source which drastically reduced its contribution to rupee securities by subscribing only Rs. 40 million, as against last year's subscription of Rs. 136 millon. Sinking Funds and Employees' Provident Fund were the principal contributors to rupee securities with a holding of Rs. 1,021 million and Rs. 1,022 million respectively, each contributing 41 per cent towards the total issues in 1981 as compared with last year's shares of 29 and 32 per cent, respectively. While the high level of government contributions to the sinking fund enabled the Joint Investment Fund (JIF) to increase its contributions to rupee securities as compared with 1980, the increase in EPF's contributions was mainly the outcome of greater mobilisation of resources resulting from the upward revision of the minimum contribution rates with effect from 1st January, 1981. Despite diversion of resources towards extra budgetary programmes of expenditure, with Sinking Funds and EPF holding debentures amounting to Rs. 370 million and Rs. 66 million respectively, these captive sources increased their contributions to rupee securities by 24 and 13 per cent, respectively in 1981. After a lapse of about 5 years, the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank entered the rupee security market in 1981 with a total contribution of Rs. 89 million. This was how\u00adever, coenncted with the enhanced equity contributions the Government was making towards the capital of the two banks. All rupee securities issued during the year were medium term securities with 3 year maturities at 16 percent interest per annum. During the year, total repayment of rupee loans was confined to Rs. 98 million.",
