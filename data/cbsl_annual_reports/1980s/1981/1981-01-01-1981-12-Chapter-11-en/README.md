BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

The Balance of Payments situation showed a considerable improvement in 1981. This development was partly a result of the adoption of appropriate demand management and flexible exchange rate policies. Movements in exchange rates,cur-tailment of the expansion in public sector expenditure and restrictive monetary policies all helped to slow down the rate of increase in the flow of imports during the year. This, together with a noticeable increase in export earnings, contribu­ted to contain the trade deficit within manageable levels. Larger inflows on account of transfers in the context of a narrowed trade deficit caused the current account deficit to register a considerable decline compared with 1980. On the other hand, there were larger capital inflows in the form of foreign loans, direct investment and short-term borrowings during the year thereby helping to reduce the overall payments deficit in 1981 to a mere fraction of the substantial deficit experienced in the previous year. Therefore, the use of net external reserves to finance the overall payments deficit was of very modest proportions in 1981.

Even though the overall balance of payments scenario in 1981 was somewhat

satisfactory, there were certain unfavourable developments too. The economic policy

package implemented since November, 1977 anticipated continuing high current

account deficits in the short-run. The liberalised trade policies, together with the

accelerated investment programme, were expected to maintain the flow of imports

at a fairly high level during the initial years. On the other hand, the export sector

was envisaged to grow displaying a high degree of diversification. The payments

deficits emerging in the intial years were expected to be financed from resources mobilised by way of private capital, official capital and facilities from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In 1981, both trade and current account deficits remained high, though some­what lower than the deficits in the previous year. The major contributory factor for the large trade deficit was the high level of imports of intermediate and investment goods during the year. Approximately three-fourths of the import outlay was on intermediate and investment goods, which were mainly earmarked for development projects in the public sector. A cut-back in the importation of these goods would have involved adverse implications for the country's development programme. Further, a good part of such imports, in any event, was financed by the flow of project aid. An additional factor that contributed to the trade deficit in 1981 was a substantial increase in import payments for crude oil, following the upward revisions in oil prices by the OPEC during 1979/80. Petroleum imports (gross) absorbed nearly one-half of the export earnings of the country in 1981. To cope with the large current account deficit, it was necessary to raise financial resources from abroad. In the context of a limited amount of resources available from conventional sources such as foreign aid loans and grants and drawings from the I.M.F., it was necessary to resort to other sources of financing. Accordingly, the pattern of financing the payments deficit changed significantly during the year, involving a considerable increase in commercial borrowings. This was one of the most unfavourable developments in the balance of payments front in 1981.

Balance of Payments Outturn

The current account deficit declined from Rs. 10,912 million (SDR 507 million) in 1980 to Rs. 9,090 million (SDR 404 million) in 1981. The current account deficit as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product declined from 16 per cent in 1980 to 11 per cent in 1981. The improvement in the current account deficit was largely the outcome of a slow-down of imports and increased inflows of private and official transfers. The net inflow of non-monetary capital amounted to Rs. 7,663 million (SDR 340 million) in 1981, compared with a level of Rs. 6,585 million (SDR 306 million) in the previous year. In view of increased capital inflows, the overall deficit was contained at Rs. 406 million (SDR 26 million) in 1981, as compared with a deficit of Rs. 2,967 million (SDR 166 million) in 1980. The net international reserves declined to the extent of the overall deficit. However, the level of gross external assets showed an increase during the year and was almost entirely reflected in foreign liquid balances of the Central Bank. The level of gross external assets at the end of 1981 was sufficient to finance two months' imports projected for 1982.

The total export earnings increased by 10 per cent (in SDR terms) from Rs.

17,603 million (SDR 818 million) in 1980 to Rs. 20,440 million (SDR 900 million)

in 1981. The growth of export earnings largely resulted from higher receipts from

non-traditional exports, mainly garments, minor agricultural products and petro­

leum products. On the other hand, earnings from traditional exports showed a

marginal improvement during the year.

Import payments increased at a slower rate of 3 per cent (in SDR terms) from Rs. 33,915 million (SDR 1,576 million) in 1980 to Rs. 36,632 million (SDR 1,616 million) in 1981. This contrasts with the rapid increase recorded in the preceding three years at an annual average rate of 36 per cent in SDR terms. The slow down of import growth in 1981 was partly a reflection of prudent demand management policies and appropriate movements in exchange rates. The withdrawal of certain tax incentives, particularly the Lump Sum Depreciation facility, also helped to restrain the increase in imports.

The services account of the balance of payments showed a smaller surplus of Rs. 136 million (SDR 6 million), in comparison with a surplus of Rs. 859 million (SDR 40 million) in 1980. With the exception of 1978, the services account showed a continuous improvement between 1973 and 1980 and helped to improve the current account position. This trend seems to have been reversed in 1981, and the major contributory factor has been the* increase in interest payments on foreign debt. Tourist earnings, port services and interest earnings on the investment of external assets were the major sources of earnings in the services account.

Interest payments on foreign loans, IMF drawings and commercial credits

increased from Rs. 968 million (SDR 45 million) in 1980 to Rs. 2,116 million (SDR

93 million) in 1981. As in many other non-oil developing countries, higher in­

terest payments absorbed a considerable portion of earnings from the export of goods

and services that could have been diverted to procure imports. Approximately,

8 per cent of earnings from the export of goods and services was abosorbed by interest

payments (including those paid to the IMF) in 1981, compared with 4 per cent in

1980. Interest earnings from the investment of external assets amounted to Rs. 555

million (SDR 25 million) in 1981. Net interest outpayments increased from Rs. 194

million (SDR 9 million) in 1980 to Rs. 1,561 million (SDR 68 million) in 1981.

Earnings from tourism increased by 32 per cent (in SDR terms) to Rs. 2,270

million (SDR 100 million) in 1981 on account of a 15 per cent increase in tourist

arrivals and a 14 per cent rise in per capita tourist expenditure. Taking into account

a sum of Rs. 749 million (SDR 33 million) of outpayments on account of Sri

Lankans travelling abroad, the net earnings from travel rose to Rs. 1,521 million

(SDR 67 million) in 1981, as compared with Rs. 1,081 million (SDR 50 million) in

the previous year.

Receipts from private transfers, mainly consisting of remittances made by

Sri Lankans employed abroad, increased by 66 per cent (in SDR terms) from Rs.

2,518 million (SDR 117 million) in 1980 to Rs. 4,402 million (SDR 194 million)

in 1981. The bulk of these remittances were by Sri Lankans working in the Middle

East, mainly Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.

A significant amount of remittances was also received from other countries including

the United Kingdom, United States and West Germany.

Official transfers received from foreign governments and international organisa­tions increased by 28 per cent (in SDR terms) from Rs. 2,281 million (SDR 106 million) in 1980 to Rs. 3,118 million (SDR 136 million) in 1981. Approxi­mately 64 per cent of official grants was in the form of project aid. The major donors were the United Kingdom, Swedish International Development Authority, Japan, European Economic Community and the United States. The bulk of commodity aid grants was provided by the Netherlands, the U.S.A., Japan and Norway.

A larger part of the external resources gap in 1981 was financed by means of non-monetary capital. These capital flows consisted of foreign borrowings, as well as direct investments. The pattern of capital inflows has undergone considerable changes in the recent past. A significant development has been the growth of com­mercial credits since 1980. Number of government departments, public corporations and private sector enterprises resorted to commercial credits to meet their payments obligations arising from imports. More important of these were Air Lanka, the Cement Corporation and the Shipping Corporation. Certain enterprises mainly those in the Investment Promotion Zone obtained loan facilities from Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs). The net capital inflow with respect to private and public sector enterprises, however, declined by 35 per cent from Rs. 3,895 million (SDR 181 million) in 1980 to Rs. 2,543 million (SDR 116 million) in 1981. This was entirely due to a considerable decline in short term trade credits obtained by the Petroleum Corpora­tion. ;

Total disbursements of official loans increased from Rs. 4,326 million (SDR

201 million) in 1980 to Rs. 6,087 million (SDR 268 million) in 1981. The increase

was mainly due to a rise in project loans and disbursement of an Euro-Currency

loan and commercial credits. Gross official capital inflows consisted of project

loans (Rs. 2,358 million or SDR 104million), commodity loans (Rs. 1,542 million

or SDR 68 million), Euro-Currency loan (Rs. 1,451 million or SDR 64 million)

and commercial credits (Rs. 736 million or SDR 32 million).

The International Monetary Fund provided assistance to Sri Lanka to the tune

of Rs. 4,528 million (SDR 194 million) during the year through various facilities.

The final drawing under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) amounting to Rs. 3,307

million (SDR 150 million) was received in four instalments in 1981. With these

drawings, Sri Lanka obtained a total sum of SDR 260.3 million under this

facility during the EFF arrangement period of 1979—1981. In addition, a Com­

pensatory Financing Facility (CFF) drawing amounting to Rs. 556 million (SDR

25 million) was obtained from the Fund in June, 1981 on account of an export

shortfall experienced in 1980. A special drawing of SDR 19 million (Rs. 412

million) was also made available by the IMF as a result of a Reserve Tranche

position arising from an increase in Sri Lanka's quota at the IMF in December 1980.

The final instalment under the fourth basic period of the SDR allocation amounted

to Rs. 252 million (SDR 12 million) was also received from the Fund in 1981.

Policy Issues

A concerted effort was made during the year to arrest the deterioration of the

external payments situation by means of demand management policies, the main

elements of which were a high degree of fiscal and monetary restraint and the

flexible exchange rate policy. These measures in particular helped to curb the rate

of increase in the flow of imports.

On the export front, export duties on tea, rubber and coconut products were

reduced during the year, with a view to enhancing producer margins. The growth of

imports was contained largely through demand management policies. The flow of

imports was particularly restrained by high costs and limited availability of bank

( 86 )

credit during the year. The removal of the Lump Sum Depreciation allowance scheme also helped to slow down the flow of imports. The import growth was reduced further by way of restraints on public sector expenditure. The adoption of these restrictive measures was essential in the context of a higher rate of domestic absorp­tion of imported goods in the early part of the year which exerted considerable pressure on the country's external assets position.

The exchange rates continued to be more flexible and were reflective of the supply-demand situation warranted by the state of the Balance of Payments. The value of the Sri Lanka Rupee continued to be determined in terms of a weighted index calculated on the basis of the value of a basket of currencies. The flexible exchange rate management policy helped to relieve pressure on the external pay­ments position to a certain extent during the year.

Every effort was made to continue to maintain an attractive investment climate in the country for foreign investors. Consequently, private capital for direct investment continued to respond, particularly in the enterprises under the Greater Colombo Economic Commission.

Exchange Rate Movements

An analysis of the movements of the Sri Lanka Rupee relative to major international currencies showed that during 1981 the Rupee had depreciated by 14 per cent against the US Dollar and 7 per cent against the Japanese Yen, making a cumulative depreciation of 28 per cent and 43 per cent, respectively, against these two currencies since November 16, 1977. However, the Sri Lanka Rupee had appre­ciated by 8 per cent against the Pound Sterling, by 2 per cent against the Deutsche Mark, by 10 per cent against the French Franc and by 4 per cent against the Indian Rupee in 1981. This was in contrast to the exchange rate movements observed in 1980, when the Rupee depreciated against all the above six major currencies. The movements in the exchange value of the Sri Lanka Rupee were basically consistent with the developments in international exchange markets which brought about an appreciation of the US Dollar in 1981 by 20 per cent against the Pound Sterling, by 8 per cent against the Japanese Yen, by 15 per cent against the Deutsche Mark, by 27 per cent against the French Franc and by 15 per cent against the Indian Rupee. As a result of the US Dollar becoming stronger in international exchange markets, it appreciated by approximately 9 per cent against the SDR, while the Sri Lanka Rupee depreciated against the SDR by about 4 per cent in 1981.

External Assets

The gross external assets of the country increased by Rs. 2,456 million (SDR

91.4 million) while the net external assets showed a decline of Rs. 406 million (SDR

26 million) during the year. At the end of 1981, the net external assets were at its

lowest level since 1977. The major contributory factor for the sharp decline in

net external assets was the increase in the liabilities of the Central Bank and of

commercial banks. For instance, the use of Fund (IMF) credits by the Central

Bank increased by 64 per cent and foreign borrowings of commercial banks by 23

per cent in 1981.

Gross external assets of the Central Bank, commercial banks, government

and government agencies and institutions stood at Rs. 6,743.2 million (SDR 283.5

million), Rs. 2,343.3 million (SDR 98 million) and Rs. 135.7 million, (SDR 5.7

million), respectively at the end of 1981. The level of gross external assets at the end

of 1981 was adequate to finance a little over 2 months' imports projected for 1982.

External Debt and Debt Service Payments

The total outstanding external debt which includes long term debt, public

sector suppliers' credits (including those of public corporations), IMF drawings and

borrowings from abroad increased by 23 per cent (in SDR terms) from Rs. 25,828

million (SDR 1,203 million) in 1980 to Rs. 34,824 million (SDR 1,476 million) in 1981.

Outstanding long term debt rose by 31 per cent in 1981, while suppliers' credits

and the drawings from the IMF increased by 41 per cent and 83 per cent, respectively.

The growth in the long term debt was largely due to increases in both project loans

and commodity loans which accounted for the largest share (32 per cent and 60 per

cent, respectively) in the long term debt category. The outstanding amount of

short-term bank borrowings decreased by 38 per cent in 1981 when compared with

the previous year.

Debt service payments which include amortization and interest payments in

respect of long term foreign loans, public sector suppliers' credits, IMF drawings

and borrowings from banks and other institutions abroad increased from Rs. 2,763

million (SDR 137 million) in 1980 to Rs. 3,529 million (SDR 150 million) in 1981.

In SDR terms the increase is 9 per cent as compared with an increase of 16 per cent

in 1980. Repurchases (repayments), interest payments and service payments to the

IMF increased by 28 per cent, while debt service payments in respect of all other

loans decreased by about 4 per cent in SDR terms. As a result, the overall debt

service ratio increased from 12.4 per cent in 1980 to 13.4 per cent, while the debt service

ratio excluding IMF transactions declined from 7.5 per cent in 1980 to 6.8 per cent

in 1981.
