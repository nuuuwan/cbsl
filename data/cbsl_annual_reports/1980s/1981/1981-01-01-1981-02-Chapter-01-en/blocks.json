Manufacturing output grew more rapidly than in 1980, mainly be-cause of the improved performance of the plantation crops, which supply the inputs for the export processing sector.

The agricultural sector, as a whole, contributed 35.5 per cent of the growth in 1981 as compared withlO. 6 per cent and 5.7 per cent in 1980 and 1979, respectively. The critical importance of plantation crops for the continued viability oftheliberalisation programme launched in 1977 need not be overstressed. A much improved performance in this sector, could bolster the economy, which had benefitted to a considerable degree by the remarkable progress achieved in the domestic non-plantation agriculture, particularly in paddy, in recent years. It also contributes in no small measure to the improved performance of the industrial sector since the processing of plantation produce is an important component of it. Above all, increased production of plantation \u00abrops, notwithstanding the adverse terms of trade the country has experienced, would certainly make the balance of payments stronger and largely ensure the continued viability of the liberalisation programme, which has an important bearing on the growth of several other sectors.",

Recession in the industrial countries, rising unemployment, continuing high energy costs, inflation, high interest rates, volatile exchange rates, low growth of world trade and declining prices of primary products other than petroleum, all led to difficulties for many developing countries including Sri Lanka. It is unfortunate, but a fact to be contended with, that Sri Lanka's export-oriented growth strategy has had to be tried and tested in an entirely hostile economic environment. There is not much hope for optimism in the global outlook in the short term. However, what is remarkable is the resilience shown by developing countries like Sri Lanka in an altogether unfavourable international environment. Sri Lanka's GDP growth rate at 5.8 per cent should, judging by international standards, count as a significant and well above average rate of growth for developing countries as a whole.",

It is evident that the high level of investment that the country has been able to sustain over the last few years has been financed by incurring large deficits in the current account of the balance of payments. Although the domestic savings effort has been bolstered by the remittances of Sri Lankans employed abroad, it will become increasingly difficult to sustain the high level of investment unless there is a marked increase in the domestic savings effort. The domestic savings ratio has declined in the past two years compared to the high level of 18.4 per cent reached in 1977. This is partly the result of the inflationary tendencies in the economy, and partly of the adverse terms of trade the country has experienced.

Due basically to the better demand management policies pursued in 1981 ,the budget deficit declined from 24 per cent ofGDP to 17per cent and the current .account deiicit in the balance of payments from 16 per cent of GDP to 11 per cent. Reflecting mainly the improved budgetary situation, and notwithstanding the conti-nued upward adjustment of certain administered prices, the rate of inflation declined. These improvements were primarily due to the wide range of measures including the reduction and tighter control of public expenditure, complementary monetary mea-sures influencing the cost and availability of credit and letting the lump sum deprecia-tion to lapse. The exchange rate too depreciated against some major international currencies during the year, reflecting to a fair extent the inflation differential bet-ween Sri Lanka and its major trading partners, thereby ensuring that the competitive",

Even the increasing level of foreign assistance and borrowings from non-batik sources have become inadequate to cover the financing requirements of growing deficits. This has resulted in sharply increased public sector competition for resources with the private sector.' The 'crowding out' effect which this creates aggravates the problem of demand management, particulaly when private sector investment has a relatively lower gestation period than public sector investment. There has also been a tendency in the last two years to resort to increasingly more expensive forms of foreign financing of the budget. Foreign commercial finance is expensive, particularly at a time when international interest rates continue to remain high. While such financing may help to contain the recourse to banking system to finance the budget, it is likely to create debt servicing problems.",

The monetary policy measures in operation in 1980 to deal with the situation had to be continued into 1981 and in fact had to be further intensified during the year, with domestic credit expansion still remaining at high rates in the first half of the year. In view of the situation, the Central Bank in May, 1981 had to resort to very direct measures to curtail the expansion of credit to the private sector. These direct measures were, however, relaxed soon and monetary measures of am ore general nature were implemented. In addition the Central Bank continued to regulate bank len-ding through moral suasion. In early June, commercial banks were advised to exercise restraint in granting credit to private sector. These measures eventually induced an increase in the lending rates of certain commercial banks. They also succeeded in inducing banks to resort to intensified efforts at mobilising deposits, by increased resort to varied forms of savings devices. There were, however, no general increase in deposit rates. The efforts at deposit mobilisation proved highly successful and the larger banks found themselves to be fairly liquid by the end of the year. Largely as a result of the rather tight and intensive monetary policy measures, there was a marked deceleration in the credit expansion to the private sector (including public corporations) from 47 per cent in 1980 to 27 per cent in 1981.",

With a view to promote regional activities, particularly in the provision of credit to the rural sector, the Bank opened its first regional branch at Matara in March, 1981. For the first time in Sri Lanka a National Credit Plan was formulated by the Central Bank covering commercial bank lending to private sector and public corporations. The exercise proved to be useful in formulating monetary policy, monitoring of credit growth and ensuring adequate credit flows to the priority sectors. The year also witnessed the introduction of the Certificates of Deposits (CD) by some banks primarily with the intention of bringing 'black money' into the institutionalised sector.

The annual average increase of the Central Bank's Wholesale Price Index in 1981 was 17 per cent as compared with 34 per cent in 1980. Nearly two-thirds of this increase occurred in the domestic group of items, while the balance was in commodities in the import group. On the wages front, the indexation of wages in the public sector late in the year was a notable development. However, notwithstanding the increases in money wages in the organised sector consisting of, central government employees and workers covered by the Wages Board, real wages declined in 1981 although at a lower rate than the decline registered in 1980. In the unorganised sector, the all island daily wage rates showed a much higher growth than in the organised sector, particularly in paddy and building construction.

In more stable SDR terms the rate of growth of imports which recorded a 41 per cent increase in 1980 showed marginally negative growth in 1981. However, the balance of trade continued to be in deficit. The trade deficit at Rs. 14,666million was 10per cent lower than the deficit recorded in 1980. While the rate of growth of exports increased in 1981, it still remained inadequate. The problem was compounded by a further deterioration in the terms of trade which declined by 21 per cent in the year. The overall performance of the export sector however, gives room for cautious optimism. The export volumes of major export commodities with the exception of tea showed some growth. Increased export earnings from the textile and garments, minor export agricultural products and other industrial exports were largely responsible for the higher growth of exports in 1981. On the import side, investment goods showed a decline largely as a result of the withdrawal of the lump sum depreciation concession early in the year. There was an increase in the share of intermediate goods while consumer goods more or less maintained their relative share in total imports.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka's balance of payments in 1981 also improved considerably when compared with 1980. As against the large overall deficit of SDR 166 million (Rs. 2,967 million) in 1980, the deficit in 1981 was SDR 26 million (Rs. 406 million). Better demand management policies and flexible exchange rate policies helped this development, which was reflected in lower trade as well as current account deficits. Larger inflows on account of both, private remittances and official transfers in the context of a narrowed trade deficit resulted in the current account deficit in 1981 showing a considerable improvement over the previous year. The larger capital inflow in the form of foreign loans including substantial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) direct investments and short term borrowings helped to contain the overall balance of payments deficit to modest proportions. The notable feature of the financing of the deficit was the increased resort to commercial borro-wings both by the Government as well as by the Public Sector Corporations in the face of limited amount of resources available from the conventional sources, such as foreign loans, and grants and drawings from the IMF. However, a larger part of the external resources gap in 1981 was financed by non-monetary capital.",

Since then, no rational attempt seems to have been made to assess the need for, and the consequences of, protection for industry implied in the present tariff structure, with the result that investment in non-priority areas may continue to be favoured, leading to a mis-allocation of resources\u00b7 The continuation of the structure may also lead to an undesirable bias in favour of import substitution vis-a-vis export industry. In view of this, the task of evolving a rational tariff structure based on levels of effective protec-tion requires urgent consideration. Action was initiated in 1980 when a study of the levels of effective protection was undertaken with the technical assis-tance of the World Bank. This work needs to be urgently followed up on a much wider and comprehensive basis by the Presidential Tariff Commiss-ion\u00b7 that has been appointed to look into this matter.",

This cannot be achieved in the short run. In the short run the emphasis of stabilisation policies is directed more on demand management as Was the case in 1981. However, medium and long term policies should necessarily be framed on long term stability through the expansion and diversification of exports. Although the export structure has undergone some change with the expansion of exports of industrial origin including garment and refined petroleum products, most of these industries export products with a high import content. The domestic value added is generally very low. Initially, this is unavoidable to an extent in a small economy like Sri Lanka, but there is an urgent need that future policy should . aim\u00b7 at raising the level of domestic value added.",

Export duties on tea, rubber and coconut were all scaled down at much cost to revenue, to ensure adequate margins to producers. .

On the domestic front, the guaranteed price of paddy was increased twice during the year by Rs. 2.50 and Rs. 5.00 to Rs. 57.50 per bushel to reflect the higher costs of inputs while a floor price scheme was devised to cover the subsidiary food crops. The price of flour\u00b7 which has a bearing on production of such crops, was adjusted upwards. There was also a significant reduction in the budgetary payments to loss-making corporations that seemed to induce animprove-ment of their performance. One of the most difficult problems encountered in working a liberalised economy has been the need to ensure remunerative margins to producers while ensuring what are deemed to be 'reasonable' prices to consumers. Most of these measures were aimed at improving producer margins at the expense of consumers and were difficult decisions. often entailing substantial sacrifices of government revenue as well.",
