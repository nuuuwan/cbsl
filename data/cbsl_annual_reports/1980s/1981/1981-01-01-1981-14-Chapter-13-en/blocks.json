    "text": "The monetary developments in 1981 were characterised by moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates when compared with the previous year. Domestic credit which expanded by an unprecedented 81 per cent in 1980, registered a much lower increase of 33 per cent during 1981, yet providing the main impetus to the monetary growth. The external banking assets (net) declined at a lower rate of 19 per cent when compared with a decline of 47 per cent in the previous year. Reflec\u00adting these changes, the monetary expansion recorded a relatively low growth of 23 per cent in 1981, as against an increase of 32 per cent in 1980. The narrow money supply (Ml), comprising currency in circulation and demand deposits held by the public, expanded by 6 per cent, while the broad money supply (M2) which includes Ml plus time and savings deposits of the public (quasi-money) rose by 23 per cent. The rate of monetary expansion slowed down appreciably in the second half of the year mainly in response to the monetary policy measures effected in mid year. The continuation of high interest rates influenced the noticeable shift in public's preference to hold interest bearing deposits.",

The broad money supply rose by Rs. 4,587 million or 23 per cent in 1981 compared to sharp increases of 38 and 32 per cent in 1979 and 1980, respectively. The deceleration was more pronounced in the growth of M l , which rose only by Rs. 596 million or 6 per cent. In the two preceding years, M l rose by 23 and 29 per cent, respectively. Hence, in 1981, the sharp rise in quasi-money by Rs. 3,990 million or 38 per cent was largely responsible for the increase in M2. The increase in quasi-money was evident from the beginning of the year, reflecting the marked shift in public's preference to hold interest bearing financial assets as against demand deposits. Apart from high interest rates, higher personal incomes and intensive marketing efforts of banks probably contributed to the substantial increase in quasi-money.",

Annual growth in Ml fluctuated somewhat erratically, but continued to show a declining trend since the beginning of the second quarter. In 1981, the currency held by the public rose by Rs. 642 million or 15 per cent compared with Rs. 407 million or 11 per cent in 1980. On the other hand, the demand deposits of the public declined by Rs. 46 million in 1981 as against an increase of Rs. 1,352 million or 35 per cent in 1980. Consequently, the share of demand deposits in M l declined from 56 to 52 per cent over the year.",

The continuity of high deposit rates during 1981, the expansion of the branch network of domestic banks, the opening of three new foreign commercial banks and the diversified instruments made available to savers such as Pension Scheme, Minors' deposits, Certificates of Deposits etc. widened the facilities available for savers during the year. Quasi-money rose continuously during the year except, in February. This may be due to the shifting of funds to investments to take advantage of the lump-sum depreciation (LSD) concessions which ceased from 31st March, 1981.",

The lower demand for credit was evident from the co-operative institutions which recorded a slight increase of Rs. 27 million in comparison with the previous year. Since paddy purchases by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) under the Guaranteed Price Scheme (GPS) declined further in 1981, the increased borrowings were mainly for retail trading by co-operative institutions, particularly towards the latter part of the year. Another important feature observed with respect to GPS purchases was that the financing on paddy procurement activities were concentrated during the month of May and June due to seasonal factors.",

Credit obtained by the corporations rose by Rs. 365 million or 9 per cent during the year, compared to an increase of Rs. 776 million or 23 per cent in the previous year. The decline in demand for credit by the corporations was largely on account of the foreign finance facilities obtained by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) since mid 1980. In addition, during the year, the financial needs of major trading corporations were reduced due to lower imports. Moreover, the better financial discipline displayed by major loss making corporations also helped to contain the demand for credit during the year.",

The (net) external banking assets however displayed an erratic behaviour during the year under review. The external banking assets (net) which underwent wider fluctuations during the first quarter, continued to decline during the next four months. It rose again by Rs. 2,275 million from August to November but declined by Rs. 347 million in December. The considerable increase in external ban\u00adking assets (net) by Rs. 1,185 million in August was largely due to the utilization of a part of the Euro-currency loan. On the whole, the decline in external banking assets (net) in 1981 was a reflection of the deficit in the balance of payments.",

Substantial growth in deposits and significant deceleration in domestic credit expansion (DCE) were the main features which characterized the sources and uses of commercial bank funds during the year. Under the impact of these factors, there was a considerable improvement in the liquidity of commercial banks. Imp\u00adroved liquidity position, in turn, enabled the commercial banks to invest excess short term funds in the money market, particularly in the interbank call market and the secondary Treasury bill market. Consequently, the banks experienced rapid adjustments in their assests portfolios. Treasury bill holdings of commercial banks which stood at a negligible Rs. 8 million at end 1980, rose to Rs. 678 million by the end of 1981.",

    "text": "On the resource side, the continuous flow of deposits to the banking network reflected the increased liquidity in the economy created by high DCE in the past few years. Meanwhile, most commercial banks were markedly aggressive in mobi\u00adlising deposits by providing incentives and diversified market instruments to attract funds. The enlarged liability base resulted in a higher than usual increase in bank's short term assets, namely the balances with the Central Bank, and money at call. A significant development observed during the year was the introduction of special savings schemes by the two state banks, with a view to mobilising long term deposits. The resources mobilised under these schemes are expected to be of relatively long term nature. This is a significant deviation from the practice, hitherto followed, of accepting deposits for short periods i.e., below 2 years. Mobilisation of long term deposits on the other hand, enabled the banks to tie up funds for medium and long term lending. Another innovation experienced during the year under review - was the introduction of certificates of deposits (CDs),* first by the American Express Bank, followed by the Middle Eastern Banks and some local banks. By end Decem\u00adber 1981, altogether five commercial banks had issued CDs amounting to Rs. 77 million. A CD is a negotiable instrument and therefore, the owner may sell the certificate to another party before maturity mainly by delivery, while preserving absolute anonymity. These CDs are purchased or discounted by the authorised dealers in the secondary market. At present, CDs are issued mainly in the de\u00adnominations of Rs. 100,000 with maturities of 3 months, 4 months, 6 months and 12 months. The interest rates tended to vary with the call money market rates. In some cases, interest rate is paid in advance as an incentive to attract savers who prefer to maintain anonymity. This provided a new source of liquidity to commercial banks, reflecting a significant move towards liability management. Moreover, the CDs were able to attract into the banking system a good part of \"black money\".",

The increase in total deposits amounted to Rs. 3,845 million, consisting of an increase in time and savings deposits amounting to Rs. 4,021 million, offset by a decline in demand deposits totalling Rs. 176 million. These developments reflected the preference of the savers to invest funds in interest bearing deposits as against demand deposits. The resource base of commercial banks was further strengthened by the increase of Rs. 996 million in paid up capital, reserve funds and undistributed profits. Resource accrual by way of monetary liability items was augmented by the increase in other liabilities amounting to Rs. 647 million. The increase in other liabilities represented the profits earned during the year and interest payable held in suspense accounts.",

Effective 21st April, 1981 the sale of secondary Treasury bills by the Central Bank commenced and at the outset, the interest rate on secondary bills stood at a range of 15 to 16.5 per cent. The change in short-term rates in the call money market led to a greater mobility of funds in between the call market and the secondary bill market and commercial banks with excess funds reacted to the interest rate advantage by intermittent transfers. With the improve\u00adment in the liquidity of commercial banks particularly, in the third quarter, funds were attracted to the bill market. Reflecting this development, interest rate in the bill market declined to a level of 15\u201415i per cent at the end of the year.",

The National Savings Bank started accepting two year fixed deposit at an interest rate of 22 per cent per annum effective 22nd April, 1981, as was already being done by the commercial banks.",

The rate which ranged from I6i\u201430 per cent for imports rose to a range of 16\u00a3\u201432 per cent, while for certain imports the rates rose as much as 8 percentage points. The rates on hire-purchase activities rose from a range of 14\u201424 to 16\u201428 per cent. The minimum interest rate on advances granted for transport and tourism also moved up by one percentage point to a range of 20\u201427 per cent. However, since the Central Bank continued to provide export credit refinance at a concessionary rate of 12 per cent, the interest rates on such refinance granted by commercial banks remained at a maximum of 16 per cent, while advances outside refinance allocations were subject to an interest rate range of 16\u201425 per cent.",

Therefore, effective 17th August, 1981, the Bank rate was raised from 12 to 14 per cent and the penal rates on Central Bank accommodation to commercial banks were also raised from a range of 20 to 30 per cent to a range of 21 to 30 per cent per annum. However, interest rate on export credit refinance continued to remain unchanged at 12 per cent. The increase in the Bank rate and in the penal rate structure reflected the less accom\u00admodative policy stance and were intended to further tighten the money market condi\u00adtions and raise the cost of funds. The immediate impact of the upward revision in the Bank rate and the penal rates was felt in the interbank call money market, where interest rates moved up.",

With the introduction of the secondary Treasury bill market on 21st April, 1981, the Central Bank engaged in open market operations in a more effective way using such operations as a monetary policy instru\u00adment. The Central Bank initiated the re-sale of Treasury bills from its portfolio quoting discount rates between the range of 15^ to 16 per cent per annum. During the early stages of this scheme, the market was active mainly due to the lower short term rates that prevailed in the call money market (11\u201414 per cent). However, due to short term liquidity problems experienced by commercial banks in response to the monetary policy measures effected during the second quarter, the call market rates rose to a peak of 19 to 23 per cent by mid year. Hence, the Treasury bill market became temporarily inactive during June and July. However, with the gradual imporvement of liquidity management of all commercial banks, particularly in the last two quarters of 1981, the secondary Treasury bill market became very active once again. Despite the lowering of interest rates to a level of 15 to I5i per cent by the end of the year, the open market operations conducted in the secondary bill market were able to mop up the excess liquidity in the commercial banks. As at end December, 1981 the net sales in the secondary bill market amounted to Rs. 684 million.",

The increase in domestic credit fell from 64 per cent at the end of March, 1981 to 32 per cent at the end of the year. Particularly, bank credit to other private sector was reduced to a more moderate level. The rate of growth of credit to this sector declined progressively from 67 per cent at the end of 1980, to 36 per cent by end 1981. The appreciable deceleration in the credit expansion and the absorp\u00adtion of excess liquidity in the banking system were largely attributable to the monetary policy measures introduced during the year. Similarly, the continued high deposit rates and the lending rates in the money market helped to moderate the inflationary pressures in the economy. The inflation rates declined from a level of 20 to 25 per cent at the beginning of the year, to around 17\u201418 per cent by the end of the year.",
