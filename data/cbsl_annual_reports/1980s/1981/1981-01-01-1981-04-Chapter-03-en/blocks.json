Coconut production rose by 11 per cent from the depressed levels recorded in the previous year. The export performance of minor export crops during the year showed that production had increased, recovering from the sluggish growth recorded by this sub-sector in the recent past. However, the production of rubber registered a decline of nearly 7 per cent mainly due to the decline in the area under tapping and a drop in the average yield. Among field crops, paddy production reached an all time high level recording a growth of 4- 6 per cent, despite the drought conditions that prevailed in several dis\u00adtricts. The performance of the minor food crops sub-sector which showed only a marginal improvement in 1980 was impressive in 1981 with many crops recording increases in output. The only exception was chillies. Sugar production increased marginally by 1 per cent. These increases in the output of both the tree and field crop sectors were recorded inspite of a sharp drop in the use of fertilizer. The drop in fertilizer was observed in all major sub-sectors, with paddy recording the largest decline. In the non-crop agriculture sector, egg production is estimated to have increased by 3 per cent. The fisheries sector recorded increased output despite various constraints.",

However, since the JEDBs and SLSPCs have reported increases in the fertilizer used on the tea plantations managed by them, the use of fertilizer in the privately owned tea lands including small holdings is likely to have decreased as in the previous year. Evidently, the small holders appeared to have sharply reduced fertilizer application on their lands. This drop in fertilizer application on privately owned tea lands was mainly the result of the price increases in fertilizer announced in February and September, 1981.",

The extent replanted by SLSPCs increased by 449 hectares. The JEDBs also reported an increase of 94 hectares in the area replanted. Available information indicates that the replanting perfor\u00admance of the private sector continued to be highly unsatisfactory. Though, the area replanted rose significantly during the year, annual achievements continued to be far behind the targets set for the sector as a whole. At the end of 1981, the total area replanted amounted to 38,766 hectares or 16 per cent of the total registered area. In view of poor replanting performance, the subsidy for replanting on privately owned tea lands was raised to Rs. 12,500 per acre (Rs. 30,888 per hectare) for high and medium grown areas and to Rs. 10,000 per acre (Rs. 24,711 per hectare) for low-grown areas, with effect from November, 1981. However,the replanting subsidy to state-owned plantations, remained unchanged. Given the high cost of replanting, even the new rates of subsidy, which do not cover the total cost of replanting, are unlikely to have a tangible impact on the replanting performance in the private sector.",

Even the marginal improvement in the export (f.o.b.) price was largely a result of the depreciation of the rupee. This marginal improvement in prices was offset by a sharp increase in the cost of production (COP) leading to a marked deterioration in producer margins. The higher prices of fertilizer and electricity, together with higher finance charges accounted for the bulk of the increase in COP. In order to assist the manufacturers to cope with the increase in the cost of manufac\u00adturing, the amount deductible as manufacturing charges for processing of bought green leaf of private holdings by the factories coming under the 'Price Support Measure Scheme ' (PSMS) was raised from Rs. 5.40 per kg. to Rs. 6.12 per kg.",

In April, 1981 the cash incentive scheme for export of packeted teas and tea bags was replaced by a duty rebate scheme. Later, in Novem\u00adber, 1981 the export duty on packeted tea was reduced from Rs. 8.50 to Rs. 6.50 per kg. and that on bulk tea was reduced from Rs. 10.50 to Rs. 8.00 per kg. The price at which the ad valorem tax was payable was raised from Rs. 18.00 per kg. to Rs. 22.00 per kg. and the tax rate was fixed at 35 per cent of the excess oyer Rs. 22.00 per kg.

Evidently, this increase was not adequate to offset increases in the cost of production during the year which resulted from highre prices of fertilizer and labour. Also one has to take cognizance of the fact, as was revealed in a survey conducted by the Central Bank, that the bulk of the small holders who sell their leaf through various types of intermediaries get prices well below the guaranteed minimum price. The green leaf market is characterized by a high degree of imperfection and these market imperfections have to be minimized to enable small holders to benefit from various schemes of assistance such as the guaranteed price paid under the PSMS. The evidence that the Central Bank has gathered shows that the lack of easy access to institutional credit is a binding cons\u00adtraint on the development of the small holder sector. The state-owned commercial banks should look into the credit needs of the small holders in the economy in order to realize the maximum production potential in that sector. Tn this context, the proposed \"Fertilizer Credit Scheme for Tea and Rubber Small holders\" may be considered a commendable step towards easy access to institutional credit for the small holders.",

These Corporations/Boards were beset by a multitude of problems during the year. As in the last year, the liquidity problems of these institutions compelled them to continue their dependence on bank overdraft facilities and on various other methods of bank financing. Higher finance charges resulting from this dependency were partly responsible for the increases in their cost of production. The increase in fertilizer prices compounded their problems as there was hardly any possibility of cutting down fertilizer use without adverse effects on production. Declining producer prices amidst rising costs of production resulted in higher nega\u00adtive producer margins when compared with those for the previous year. However, the producer margins of the private sector plantations appear to have been more favourable owing to better prices that they received during the year and also due to the lower unit cost of production.",

It is equally important to strengthen the service institu\u00adtions catering to the tea small holder sector. As pointed out in previous Annual Reports, the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority, set up to develop the sector, has neither the resources nor adequate authority to deal with problems of small holders. There is a great deal of potential in the small holder sector for rapid growth, particularly in districts such as Galle and Matara. However, the realization of this potential depends upon appropriate policy inducements and provisions for an effective service structure. It must be emphasized that fiscal relief such as export duty reductions often demanded by the plantation management would only result in a loss of revenue to the Government if deficiencies in the institutional structure are not minimized.",

The predominant factors were the growing incidence of senility in rubber trees, the drought that prevailed in early part of 1981 and the marketing problems confronted by small holders. The last two factors led to a reduction in the number of tapping days in 1981 in relation to 1980. In addition, the reduction in the use of fertilizer had a significant adverse impact on the yield. Fertilizer use on rubber lands decreased by 24 per cent during the year to 16,800 metric tons. Adverse weather conditions coupled with higher fertilizer prices were responsible for this drop in the use of fertilizer. Given the likely decrease in area under tapping in the near future, increase in production depends entirely on the increase in the yield per hectare. In this context, the relative drop in fertilizer use and the low level of fertilizer use in absolute terms, warrant the urgent attention of the policy makers.",

The total area replanted at the end of 1981 amounted to 156,390 hectares or 70 per cent of the total area under cultivation. The replanting subsidy for private estates and small holders was further increased from Rs. 6,500 per acre (Rs. 16,062 per hectare) to Rs. 7,500 per acre (Rs. 18,533 per hectare) in November, 1981 with a view to accelerating replanting activities in the private sector. The increases in the cost of replanting during the year called for an upward revision in the rate of subsidy. Along with this upward revision of the replanting subsidy the replanting cess was raised from Rs. 0.50 to Rs. 0.75 per kg. to augment the replanting subsidy fund.",

On account of unfavourable developments in the sheet rubber market, including the \" reduced scale of purchases of rubber for export to China during the first quarter of 1981, the export of better quality sheet rubber (RSS Nos. 1, 2 and 3) was liberalised in the first half of 1981 by withdrawing the monopoly hitherto enjoyed by the Com\u00admissioner of Commodity Purchase over the export of such rubber. Regular sheet rubber auctions were also organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.

The expansion in production ensured that consumer needs could be satisfied without Jeopardising exports. The export of all coconut products (except coir fibre) was decontrolled during the year. The export of coir fibre remained under the minimum indicative price scheme due to its unfavourable position in the World Market. A new sliding scale of export duties for three major products was introduced in Novem\u00adber, 1981 assuming a base price of Rs. 1,450 per 1000 nuts. This was designed to ensure that a greater share of the profits from exports would accrue to the producers.",

This was an attempt to cushion the adverse impact of the increased price of fertilizer. In view of the widespread use of new high yielding seed varieties, which are highly sensitive to the use of fertilizer, the rising costs of fertilizer may have an unfavourable impact on paddy production in the future although the continuation of attractive open market prices should help to mitigate the problem. The cost of other inputs such as agro-chemicals, tractor hire and labour has also risen. Neverthless, the open market price of paddy which was well above the guaranteed price, (the ave\u00adrage open market price ranging from Rs. 65.00 to Rs. 74.00 at various times during the year), enabled the farmers to maintain positive producer margins.",

    "text": "Purchases of paddy by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) declined by 53 per cent in 1981, indicating the continuation of the declining trend shown in the previous year. Almost all purchases made by the PMB were confined to the first half of the year. Only 605 metric tons (28,968 bushels)w ere purchased during the second half. As in previous years, the bulk of its purchases were from the Dry Zone districts of Amparai, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. Paddy purchased from the Wet Zone districts amounted to 14,226 metric tons, or 11 per cent of total purchases. The declining trend in the PMB procurements underlines the dominant role of the private sector in the marketing of paddy . In the early part of the year, the PMB decided to make an attempt at increasing their purchases by the introduction of a Tender Scheme to attract paddy from private trading sources. Furthermore, the PMB was authorised to make direct purchases from the fanners on a competitive basis, at prices above the guaranteed price, as and when necessary. The attempt to increased purchases was explained primarily in terms of a need to keep an adequate buffer stock so that a fairly stable flow of rice to the market could be maintained to avoid rapid seasonal movements in the consumer prices. However, the rice prices in the open market increased despite the release of buffer stocks by the PMB at lower prices toward the latter half of the year. The open market price of rice per kg. increased steadily during the year. The prices of all qualities of rice increased by 12 per cent, on average, from the first half of 1981 to the second half. Given the present high open market price of paddy it is not surprising that the PMB, despite its attempts to compete with the private sector, could not make significant purchases in 1981. Nevertheless, the PMB was able to play its role as a floor-price operator enabling the producers to have some bargaining power in the market due to the guaranteed minimum price. The existence of the GPS ensured that there was no price depression during surplus periods.",

In the Mahaweli 'H' area, a concerted effort was made to pursuade farmers to shift to minor food crops with a view to economising on water. However, the effect of the considerable increase in the extent cultivated was not felt fully on production partly owing to a decrease of 37 per cent in fertilizer issues to this sector.

This deficiency has to be remedied to harness the full benefits from the rationalization of fertilizer distribution at the wholesale level. The availability of fertilizer at the retail stores in sufficient quantities at the correct time has a significant bearing on the application of fertilizer by the farmers. Moreover, in view of the large share of fertilizer in the total import bill, more emphasis should be placed on the efficient use of fertilizer in all crop sectors.",
