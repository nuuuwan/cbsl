PRICES

The rate of increase in the general level of prices as measured by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index declined substantially in 1981. Compared with an increase of 26 per cent in 1980, the index rose by only 18 per cent in 1981. On a point to point basis as well the index showed the same increase in December, 1981 over the corresponding month of the previous year. This deceleration in price increases has been the combined outcome of a less expansionary fiscal policy, a restrictive monetary policy and a lower rate of increase in import prices.

The commodity-wise classification of the index indicated that 60 per cent of the increase in 1981 was due to higher prices of the domestic group commodities, while 35 percent and 5 per cent were due to increases in the prices of imports and locally produced export commodities, respectively. A further analysis of the index disclosed that the upward revision of prices of rice, wheat flour and bread accounted for 49 per cent of the increase in the index. The balance 51 per cent reflected the impact of price increases in other items.

The Wholesale Price Index of the Central Bank, too reflected a slower rate of growth of prices in 1981. The annual average of the index increased by 17 per cent, in 1981, compared to an increase of 34 per cent in 1980. Of the increase in the Wholesale Price Index, 64 per cent was due to the increase in the prices of items in the domestic group, while 36 per cent was due to that in the import group. The prices of locally produced export commodities did not feature significantly in the increase of the Wholesale Price Index in 1981.

A classification of the commodities by end use indicates that higher prices of consumer goods accounted for 66 per cent of the increase, while 32 per cent and 2 per cent were accounted by the price increases of intermediate and investment goods, respectively.

In sum, after a year of pronounced increase in the price level in 1980, there were hopeful signs that better demand management policies pursued in the year under review helped to moderate pressure on the price level.

WAGES

The year 1981 witnessed significant changes in the wage policies of the govern­ment, particularly as far as government sector employees were concerned. On the recommendations of the Salaries Review Committee, which have been accepted by the government, changes such as consolidation of basic salary and all allowances, cutting down of the number of categories or grades of employees to a more manageable size are to be implemented in 1982.

An allowance linked to the Colombo Consumers' Price Index for all public sector employees came into force in November, 1981. While there was yet a decline of the wages of government employees in real terms, indexation which took effect late in this year helped to limit this decline as compared with the decrease registered in 1980, In the organised private sector too real wages declined. However, in the unorganised sectors such as paddy and building construction there was an increase of wages in real terms.

In the organised sector of the economy the money wages are measured by the minimum wage rate indices for central government employees and for workers covered by Wages Boards. The minimum wages of central government employees increased at a faster rate in 1981 than in 1980. In the case of the technical and clerical employees the minimum wage rate index increased by 13 per cent in 1981 compared to a 10 per cent increase in the previous year. In the case of minor employees and school teachers, the increases in minimum wages were 16 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, as against increases of 12 per cent and 9 per cent in 1980. These increases in minimum wages were the result of the linking of wages of government employees to the cost of living index in November, 1981.

Real wages1 of government employees declined further by 3 per cent in 1981 compared to a decline of 12 per cent in 1980. Real wages of technical and clerical employees too declined by 5 per cent against a decline of 13 per cent in 1980, while the real wages of minor employees and school teachers dropped by 2 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, compared to decreases of 12 per cent and 14 per cent in 1980.

In the organised private sector, the minimum wages of workers in the tea, rubber and coconut sectors declined marginally by 0.2 per cent in 1981. The mini­mum wages of workers in industry and commerce increased at a slower rate of 13 per cent compared to an increase of 22 per cent in the previous year. When combining the wage rates in the organised agricultural, industrial and commercial sectors a marginal increase of 1 per cent was observed in the minimum wage rate index against an increase of 25 per cent in the previous year.

The real wages of workers in agriculture which dropped marginally by 0.2

per cent in 1980 declined further by 16 per cent in 1981. Similarly, real wages of

workers in industry and commerce decreased by 5 per cent compared with a decrease

of 3 per cent in the previous year.

In the unorganised sectors such as paddy and building construction, the all

island daily wage rates showed a higher rate of growth when compared to the organised

sectors. In paddy the daily wage rate in 1981 was Rs. 25, which when compared

with a daily wage rate of Rs. 20 in 1980, showed an increase of 25 per cent. Si­

milarly, in the construction sector the daily wage rates for carpenters and masons

in 1981 were Rs. 45 and Rs. 46. This compared with Rs. 37 and Rs. 36 recorded

in 1980 shows an increase of 21 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively for workers

in these two activities.

The daily wage rates deflated by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index showed

a real increase of 6 per cent in the paddy sector and 8 per cent in the construction

sector.
