    "text": "Growth, in the various monetary aggregates increased appreciably in 1987. A high rate of domestic credit expansion and a resurgence in the growth of quasi-money were the main features of monetary developments in 1987. Narrow money supply (M,) consisting of currency and demand deposits held by public grew by Rs. 3,904 million or 18 per cent, compared with an increase of Rs. 2,418 million or 13 per cent in 1986. Meanwhile, time and savings deposits held by the public with commercial banks (quasi-money) expanded by Rs. 3,571 million. Consequently, broad money supply (Mj) defined to include M| plus quasi-money grew sharply by Rs. 7,475 million or 15 per cent, compared to a growth of Rs. 2.451 million or 5 per cent in the previous year.",

The currency component rose by Rs. 1.925 million or 17 per cent, while the demand deposit component recorded a growth of Rs. 1,979 million or 21 per cent. The slightly higher growth in the demand deposit component of M, resulted in a marginal increase in its share in M, by 1 percentage point to 46 per cent at the end of 1987. However, the public's demand for currency, especially the currency notes in the denominations of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500, remained high reflecting the increased use of currency for high value transactions as well as the disruption of n cr m a l banking services in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The share of these currency notes in the total currency issue rose from 56 per cent as at the end of 1986 to 61 per cent by the end of 1987.",

This growth was mainly reflected in time and savings deposits of the other private sector constituents (OPSC), i.e., pri\u00advate sector proper, which grew by Rs. 3,384 million or 14 per cent. Over 50 per cent of this increase occurred during the last quarter of the year. Relatively higher export prices in rupee terms largely due to the depreciation of the rupee and the narrowing of the gap between deposit rates of banks and other competing institutions were the major factors contributing to the substantial growth of private sector time and savings deposits during this period. Time and savings deposits of government corporations recorded a marginal increase of Rs. 119 million in contrast to a sharp decline of Rs. 1,067 million during the previous year. Similarly, time and savings deposits of co-operative institutions increased by Rs. 69 million during 1987.",

The comparable increases in NCG and GCPS in the pre\u00advious year were Rs. 2,198 million or 11 per cent and Rs. 2,684 million or 7 per cent respectively. The growth in NCG was reflected in an increase in its share in the total DC, which rose from 35 per cent in 1986 to 36 per cent in 1987. It must, however, be stated that the expansion in NCG in 1987 amounting to Rs. 4,502 million includes a special loan of Rs. 683 million from the Central Bank for meeting Sri Lanka's obligations to the I.M.F. consequent upon successive revaluation of liabilities to the Fund, which cannot be related to normal budgetary operations during the year.",

    "text": "During the year, the major share of the growth in GCPS amounting to Rs. 6,955 million was in respect of the other private sector constituents (OPSC). Compared with an increase of Rs. 2,263 million or 7 per cent in 1986, commercial bank credit to OPSC grew by Rs. 4,629 million or 13 percent in 1987. The latter represented about two thirds of the growth in the total GCPS during the year. More than half of this increase occurred in the last quarter of the year. The higher utilisation of bank credit by the private sector was reflected in increased demand for export credit associated with relatively favourable prices and the provision of increased credit for imports and related trading activities to cover higher rupee values. Credit to OPSC mainly took the form of loans and overdrafts which recorded increases of Rs. 2,860 million and Rs. 1,318 million, respectively during the year.",

The corporations which recorded substantial credit growth in 1987 were the Sri Lanka State Plantations Cor* poration (SLSPC) (Rs. 288 million), Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB) (Rs. 353 million), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) <Rs. 1,308 million) and the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) (Rs. 223 million). The effective implementation of the Medium Term Investment Programme (MTIP) for the de\u00advelopment of state owned plantations was largely responsible for the increase i s bank credit to SLSPC and JEDB. Increased utilisation of credit by the CPC were for both",

The outstanding net sales in the STBM dropped from Rs. 1,255 million as at the end of 1986 to Rs. 812 million as at the end of 1987.

    "text": "Conforming to the trends observed in the previous yeai, ihe interest rate structure tended to move downwards, though modestly, with further reductions in rates appli\u00adcable to certain categories of advances and deposits. This partly reflected the excess* liquidity position in the financial system arising mainly due to a low demand for credit in particular during the first half of the year. However, the interest rates failed to decline to the extent as was anticipated, largely due to the action on the part of the National Savings Bank (NSB) which maintained its rate on fixed deposits at 13 per cent per annum thereby compelling commercial banks to follow a more guarded policy with respect to revision of interest rates.",

This prooess began in early 1986 with the withdrawal of the requirement to maintain special reserves under a Tranche System introduced in late 1984. This was followed by the withdrawal with effect from June, 1987 of the requirement to maintain reserves against unutilised balances of overdrafts imposed in December, 1983. However, in a major revision effected in early August, the reserve ratio on demand deposits was lowered from 18 per cent to 10 per cent, while that on time deposits (not exceeding 90 days) was brought down from 14 per cent to 10 per cent, thus unifying the ratio at 10 per cent for all types of com\u00admercial banks' deposit liabilities. Consequent on the above revisions, the average reserve ratio on deposit liabilities declined from 12.3 per cent to 10.0 per cent. Ac\u00adcordingly, despite an increase in total deposits of commercial banks by Rs. 3,240 million in 1987, total required reserves dropped from Rs. 5,380 million by the end of 1986 to Rs. 4,594 million as at the end of 1987, recording a decline of Rs. 786 mil\u00adlion or 15 per cent.",
