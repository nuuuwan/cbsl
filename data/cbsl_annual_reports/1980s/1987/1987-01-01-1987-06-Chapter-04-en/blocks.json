The decline in the output of Ceramics Corporation was mainly due to high absenteeism of workers and the closure of its factory at Negombo for nearly 214 months for repairs and maintenance. The output of the State Hardware Corporation fell due to shortfalls in the availability of raw materials in the latter part of 1987, resulting from delayed shipments. The Distilleries Corporation recorded a drop in output because of a sharp reduction in the supply of toddy on account of drought conditions in collecting areas. The Distilleries Corporation was also compelled to cut back production due to disruption of sales in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The output of the Sri Lanka Tyre Corporation declined owing to marketing problems.",

The Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation received Rs. 237 million or 82 per cent of the total budgetary transfers to public corporations during 1987. Other corporations that received budgetary transfers in 1987 were National Textiles, National Paper and National Milk Board (privatised as Milco Ltd.). Data suggest that there had been drastic reductions in the level of government transfers to public corporations in recent years reducing public corporations' dependence on the government budget.",
