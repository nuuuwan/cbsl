    "text": "The year 1987 marked a considerable slowing down of Sri Lanka's economic performance. In real terms, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have increased by 1.5 per cent-the lowest since the economic reforms of 1977. The average rate of growth of the real GDP during the 10 year period 1977-1986 was 5.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the Gross National Product (GNP) in 1987 at constant (1982) prices, which is derived by allowing for the flow of net factor income from abroad, recorded a growth rate of 1.6 per cent. This compared with a real GNP growth rate of 4.5 per cent in the previous year.",

    "text": "The modest economic performance in 1987 had been the outcome-of a combination of factors. Foremost among them was a pronounced set-back to agricultural production. Under the impact of adverse weather, and continuing civil disturbances in the Northern and Eastern regions, value added in the agricultural sector as a whole declined by 8 per cent in 1987. Among the plantation crops, only tea showed some resilience, with an output growth of 1 per cent. The production of rubber declined by 11 per cent and of coconut, by 25 per cent. In the food crop sector, the output of paddy dropped by 18 per cent, and sugar, by 15 per cent. Another sector which performed below expectations was the services sector, where value added increased by only 2.7 per cent, as compared with a growth of 4.3 per cent in 1986.",

In the manufacturing sector, the value added in private sector industries increased by 13 per cent, while that in state owned industries declined by 3 per cent. Meanwhile, export-oriented agricultural pro\u00adcessing recorded a growth of 4 per cent, largely owing to a switching of tea production toward high value added products. The production of tea in packeted form increased by 15 per cent during the year. The overall output growth in the manufacturing sector was 7 per cent in 1987, and the overwhelmingly larger share of this occurred in factory industry, the output of which weighs heavily in the total production of this sector. According to Central Bank's Survey of Industrial Production, the industrial groups showing noteworthy increases were textile and wearing apparel, fabricated metal products, chemicals and non-metallic mineral products. Largely due to a favourable performance of the gem industry, the output in the mining and quarrying sector rose by an impressive 19 per cent in 1987.",

This drop in production, which was more pronounced during the second half of the year, was very largely the outcome of prolonged drought conditions in the major coconut growing areas during 1986 and 1987. An additional factor was the lagged effect of lower fertilizer application during 1985 and 1986 when the prices remained highly depressed. Moreover, fertilizer application tends to decline during periods of drought. Reflecting the sharp fall in nut production, the output of all major coconut export products-coconut oil, desiccated coconut (DC) and copra-registered decreases. Consequently, although there was a significant recovery of coconut prices in international markets during 1987, Sri Lanka was not able to reap the full benefits of this price improvement. The exports of coconut kernel products declined by 51 per cent in 1987.",

The drastically reduced levels of water in the reservoirs due to long spells of drought in the catchment areas, severely restricted the generation of hydro power. Thus, the country's power requirements had to be met by an increased dependance on thermal power, involving a heavy consumption of diesel and heavy fuel. In fact, with increasing constraints on electricity generation, island-wide three and half hour power cuts had to be imposed between August and October, with adverse effects on economic activity. Meanwhile, there was an increase in the price of petroleum products (including crude oil) in the international markets. Hence, the outlay on petroleum imports rose considerably, adding pressure on the balance of pay\u00adments. The total oil import bill rose by 20 per cent in SDR terms, accounting for 14 per cent of total imports, as against 11 per cent in the previous year.",

Adverse) weather conditions injmajor producing areas and the unsettled conditions in the North and the East dampened the production of food items such as rice and dried chillies, creating occasional shortages and price increases. The severe set-back to coconut production caused prices to rise sharply. Domestic sugar prices rose as a consequence of price increases in international markets, while the price of beef also increased. For manufactured goods, the producers tended to adjust prices in line with rising costs of raw materials and wages. At the same time, higher excise duties resulted in raising the tobacco and alcohol prices, while prices of export commodities remained high due to better prices in international markets and the exchange rate depreciation. The depreciation of the Rupee pushed import prices up, in terms of domestic currency, an unavoidable result of the process of safeguarding the external balance. On the demand side, there was some relaxation of monetary policy resulting in an acceleration in the growth of bank credit, particularly during the last quarter of the year. The Budget deficit continued to be expansionary. These develop\u00adments tended to maintain aggregate demand high at a time when the domestic supply situation came under strain during the last quarter of the year.",

Thus, while the external debt had expanded by a significant margin in Rupee terms (24 per cent) in 1987, the increase in SDR terms had been very marginal. In large part, the sharp increase in the external debt in Rupee terms arose from the depreciation of the Rupee. As a result, the ratio of outstanding debt to GDP rose from 62 per cent in 1986 to 64 per cent in 1987. External obligations to the IMF decreased for the third consecutive year, decreasing from SDR 234 million in 1986 to SDR 165 million in 1987, following large repurchases (i.e. repayments) made during the year.",

    "text": "Although the budget deficit was a considerable improvement from the previous year, the resources for financing the deficit were less forthcoming in 1987. The resources available from foreign loans were Rs. 5,716 million which was 37 per cent lower than in the previous year. Thus, foreign loans which financed nearly one half of the budget deficit in recent years, contributed only a third in 1987. The resources available from domestic non-bank sources of Rs. 6,399 million also showed a decline of 5 per cent. Hence, a larger volume of resources had to be utilised from banking sources than in the previous year for financing the budget deficit in 1987. Resources obtained from the banking system was Rs. 3,541 million representing 1.8 per cent of the GDP in 1987. The expansionary deficit in 1986 was 1.7 per cent of GDP.",

Although it had been possible to moderate to some extent the adverse consequences of expansionary financing in the short-run by adopting restrictive monetary policies, in the long-run, excessive monetary restraint can prove to be counter-productive. Furthermore, the increases in service payments on the government debt continued to put an additional stress on the country's fiscal system. These developments would suggest the need for concerted efforts at fiscal discipline so as to strike a closer balance between the availability of resources and the expenditure commitments.",

Despite the sharp growth in credit, the commercial banking system remained liquid enabling'considerable investments to be made in short-term government paper (Treasury bills). In this background and assisted by a further significant relaxation of the reserve requirements by the Central Bank, interest rates tended to decline, though modestly. The Central Bank which issued its own securities under Section 91 of the Monetary Law Act during 1985 and 1986 to mop- up excess liquidity, relied more on an activation of the Treasury bill market for this purpose in 1987. Toward this, several measures were taken to give greater market orientation to the Treasury bill market. The monetary policy was slightly eased with a view to stimu\u00adlating economic activity through greater availability of credit at moderate cost. Market forces were encouraged to play a greater role in the determination of interest rates, particularly at the short-end of the market. Refinance facilities of the Central Bank were further enhanced during the year, for promoting activities in productive sectors of the economy.",

Meanwhile, the broad money supply (M 2), defined to include Mj plus time and savings deposits held by the public with commercial banks (quasi money), recorded an increase of Rs. 7,475 million or 15 per cent, compared with a growth of Rs. 2,451 million or 5 per cent in the previous year.

The share of deposits in Mi which had been hovering around 50 per cent for a considerable length of time, started declining since 1983, reaching 45 per cent at the end of 1986. This development was attributable to the disruption of normal banking services in some parts of the country due to the civil unrest. In 1987, there was a reversal of this trend to 46 per cent, which though marginal, can be considered a welcome development.",

    "text": "million in 1986, quasi money grew by Rs. 3,571 million or 12 per cent in 1987. The growth in quasi money in 1985 was 11 per cent. Thus, the indications are that after an unusual dip in 1986, the growth of quasi money assumed normal proportions reflecting the re-emergence of bank deposits as an attractive investment outlet. The growth in quasi money came mainly from other private sector constituents (OPSC), i.e. private sector proper, whose time and savings deposits rose by Rs. 3,384 million or 14 per cent. In comparison, time and savings deposits of government corporations increased by a meagre Rs. 119 million and those of co-operative institutions by Rs. 69 million. Incidentally, more than half of the growth in quasi money of the OPSC occured during the last quarter of the year. Relatively better export prices and the narrowing of the gap between the deposit rates of commercial banks and finance companies were the principal contributory factors for this development.",

External banking assets (net) declined by Rs. 443 million or 5 per cent during the year. The decreases in these assets in 1985 and 1986 were Rs. 691 million or 7 per cent and Rs. 414 million or 4 per cent, respectively. Although the balance of payments out-turn in 1987 was a marginal improvement from 1986, both trade and current accounts recording lower deficits, the overall balance remained in deficit to the tune of SDR 72 million, and was financed by drawing on external assets. The continuing decline in external banking assets since 1984 reflect the vulnerability of Sri Lanka's external sector to both domestic and external pressures, which underscores the importance of maintaining stability to promote the development of a strong external sector.",

The acceleration in the DCE in 1987 was reflected in both net credit to Government (NCG) and gross credit to private sector (GCPS). In all , the NCG from the banking system increased by Rs. 4,502 million or 20 per cent in 1987, as compared with a growth of Rs. 2,198 million or 11 per cent in the previous year. At the same time, GCPS from the commercial banks rose by Rs. 6,955 million or 17 per cent, in comparison to a much lower increase of Rs. 2,684 million or 7 per cent a year ago.",

The growth in NCG resulted in an increase in its share in domestic credit from 35 per cent in 1986 to 36 per cent in 1987. It must, however, be stated that the increase in NCG directly attributable to budgetary operations during the year was slightly lower at Rs. 3,819 million, as the NCG included a special loan of Rs. 683 million from the Central Bank to Government for meeting Sri Lanka's obligations to the IMF con\u00adsequent upon successive revaluations of liabilities to the Fund. Yet, the level of bank credit utilised by the Government in 1987 for budgetary purposes is considerable and points to a need for a firm resolve to achieve greater fiscal discipline in the coming years.",

In com\u00adparison, the increase in NCG from the Central Bank during 1987 was Rs. 1,468 million, which included a special loan of Rs.683 million on account of IMF transactions.

The two plan\u00adtations corporations, Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) and Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB), which resorted to considerable bank borrowings in the previous year, again had heavy recourse to bank credit in 1987. However, the borrowings in 1987 were on account of the implementation of the Medium Term Invest\u00adment Programme (MTIP) for the development of state owned plantations, rather than for overcoming liquidity problems. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) utilised increased credit because of an upward movement in crude oil prices, and also because it needed to build up stocks of finished products to meet the demand during the closure of the refinery for maintenance purposes. Another corporation which enhanced its access to bank credit in 1987 was the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) and this was for the bulk importation of essential food items. Several corporations, however, reduced their reliance on bank credit during the year. Among them were the Ceylon Steel Corporation, Ceylon Plywoods Corporation, Sri Lanka Cement Corporation and the Veyangoda Textile Mills.",

In the first instance, Bank rate was reduced by 1 percentage point to 10 per cent per annum in August, 1987.

These banks have been engaged in some rationalisation of their operations, and if market forces are to play a greater role in the determination of interest rates, these measures will have to be intensified.",

A major problem in the external sector in 1987 was that the weather affected agricultural output did not permit the full benefits of the up-turn in prices to be realised. Despite heavy investments in irrigation and hydro power, Sri Lanka continues to be highly vulnerable to vagaries of the weather. Along with rebounding of oil prices and the rise in debt service payments, the external sector continued to be most vulnerable. These developments reflected the harsh realities of a narrowly based, primary trade-dependent economy striving to maintain a reasonable rate of growth in a hostile environment. Thus, the Sri Lanka economy faces formidable challenge in 1988 and beyond. Given the paucity of natural resources and the limitations of the agricultural sector, Sri Lanka must necessarily go for a more diversified economic structure. But in doing so, she must make the very difficult transition from an economy dependent on a narrow export base and a large public sector with low productivity to one in which export oriented activities and the investment in productive ventures are the broad parameter of the development strategy aimed at a healthier and more balanced economy.",

The resurgence of inflationary pressures should be dampened with utmost determination. Failure to achieve this would result in eroding the confidence in the economy. It needs to be recognised that for controlling inflation, the freedom of action in the field of monetary policy is somewhat limited, if the incen\u00adtives for investment and production are not to be thwarted. In fact, the approach to monetary policy in the period ahead would require a delicate balancing of conflicting considerations.

Specific targets were set for the budget deficit and the current account deficit of the balance of payments. In terms of these targets, the budget deficit (before grants) was expected to be reduced from 11 per cent of GDP in 1987 to 9 per cent in 1989, while the current account deficit in the balance of payments was to decline from 7 per cent of GDP in 1987 to 5 per cent in 1989, a deficit that could be managed with highly concessional foreign resources.",

Within these limits, current expenditure/GDP ratio at 20 per cent in 1987 is expected to decline to 18 per cent during 1988-1990. The gradual reduction in the budget deficit is expected to be achieved through a progressive reduction in capital expenditure from 13 per cent of GDP in 1988 to 11.5 per cent of GDP by 1990. Based on this fiscal adjustment, current account deficit of the balance of payments, as a proportion of GDP is expected to decline from 9 per cent in 1987 to 5 per cent in 1990. The adjustment in the balance of payments assumes a fairly strong growth in exports and import substitution sectors following the adoption of a new industrial policy, export promotion and a programme of privatisation.

In fact, the structural imbalances emerged largely due to an attempt to force the pace of development through a heavy expenditure programme significantly in excess of available resources. Basically, the balance of payments deficits and price pressure are the inevitable consequences of excessive growth of domestic expenditure, faster than what the economy can sustain on a non-inflationary basis. While recognising the demands of competing claims, fiscal policy cannot lose sight ol the overriding need for maintaining macroeconomic balance. Sri Lanka must have the vision, the will and the discipline to recognise the constraints the country faces, and to conduct its affairs in a manner that permits the necesssary adjustment to occur in an orderly manner, in the context of economic growth. Such action should contribute immensely to bolstering confidence in Sri Lanka's endeavours at economic advancement with international support.",
