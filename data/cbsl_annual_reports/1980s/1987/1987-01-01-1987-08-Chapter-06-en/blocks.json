Among them were the adverse impact of the drought on the production of agricultural commodities, higher excise duty on tobacco and alcohol, unsettled conditions in the Northern and Eastern provinces and the higher international prices for export commodities. On the demand side, there was some relaxation in the restrictive credit policies that were in operation since 1984 resulting in a significant acceleration in the growth of bank credit, particularly during the closing months of 1987. However, the stability in fuel oil prices was a major factor in containing the level of overall price increase.",

    "text": "Several categories of workers in the organised private sector, however, received wage increases during the year. In nominal terms, the Minimum Wage Rate Index for all workers in trades covered by Wages Boards increased by 6.3 per cent on average during 1987, as compared to 5.4 per cent in the previous year. However, their real wages deteriorated by 1.4 per cent in 1987 relative to the position in 1986. The Mini\u00admum Wage Rate Index of workers in agriculture moved up by 4.9 per cent in 1987 due to the variable cost of living allowance payable to these workers. In the previous year, the corresponding increase was 5.3 per cent. Workers in industry and commerce received a relatively higher wage increase. The Minimum Wage Rate Index for these Workers increased by 14.3 per cent in nominal terms, as compared to a 10.0 per cent rise in 1986. Wages of this category of workers improved in real terms when compared to 1986. Among those who received wage increases during the year were workers in the trades of garment manufacture, ice and aerated water, leather and footwear, nursing homes, cinema, printing and building. The Minimum Wage Rate Index of workers in services which had remained unchanged in 1986 moved up by 3.1 per cent, in 1987.",
