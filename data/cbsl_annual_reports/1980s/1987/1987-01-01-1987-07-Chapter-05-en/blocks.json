Low rain fall in catchment areas severely res\u00adtricted the generation of hydro power. As a result, in order to meet the demand for electricity it became necessary to generate thermal power involving heavy consump\u00adtion of diesel and heavy fuel. Intensification of security activities also contributed to the rise in the consumption of certain petroleum products. The higher demand for petroleum products resulted in an increase in imports of petroleum which together with the increase in oil prices in the international market caused outlays on oil imports to rise considerably.",

The diesel power station at Pettah with a capacity of 6 MW, which was decommissioned in 1986 was recommissioned in June, 1987.

As the water levels of the. reservoirs were not sufficient to operate the hydro power plants at full capacity, the shortfall had to be met by thermal power generation. As a result, the relative share of power generated by hydro sources declined from 99.7 per cent in 1986 to 80.4 per cent in 1987. Generation of thermal power resulted in increased consumption of heavy diesel, residual fuel and heavy fuel amounting to 157,463 metric tons when compared with 1,618 metric tons consumed in 1986. Consequently, the cost of fuel used by the CEB for power generation increased substantially from Rs. 11.6 million in 1986 to Rs 1,165.6 million in 1987. In order to recover the additional costs incurred in the generation of thermal power, with effect from 1st May, 1987 the CEB imposed a Fuel Adjustment Charge of 15 per cent \"on consumption of electricity in excess of 150 units.\" This was increased to 30 per cent with effect from 1st September, 1987. With difficulties experienced in the supply of electricity due to the drought conditions and high cost of thermal power generation, the CEB imposed island\u00abwide power cuts last-",

The slow growth of electricity sales was mainly due to power cuts and the interruption of power supply due to civil disturbances. However, with the exception of the industrial sector, all other sectors recorded increases in the consumption of electricity during 1987. The industrial sector recorded a decline of 5 per cent in power consumption over the previous year due to power cuts. Electricity consumption by the industrial sector at 879 million kWh was 39 per cent of total electricity sales during the year. Bulk purchases by local authorities amounted to 573 million kWh or 25 per cent of the total electricity consumption in 1987.

Civil disturbances in some parts of the country were responsible for the decline in the operated kilometerage. These disruptions adversely affected scheduled services in the Northern and Eastern regions, while in some other parts the disturbances resulted in considerable damage to the vehicle fleet. In the Northern and Eastern regions, the SLRTBs were able to operate only 28 per cent and 32 per cent respectively of the scheduled kilometerage.

Nevertheless, the SLCTB earned a total revenue of Rs. 2,510 million in 1987 against Rs. 2,332 million earned in 1986, recording an increase of 7.6 per cent. Meanwhile substantial losses were reported by the RTBs in the Northern, Eastern, North-Central and Sourthern regions. As in previous years, the SLCTB received a subsidy from the Treasury to the extent of 12.3 per cent of the total operating costs. The subsidy was on account of concessionary season tickets to students, passes to police and security personnel and losses incurred on uneconomic routes. The quantum of the subsidy amounted to Rs. 287 million in 1987, of which Rs. 152 million was for servicing uneconomic routes.",

Also, the prohibition of passenger transport in low-roof, low-capacity coaches in the city routes and long distance routes diverted passenger traffic to the public sector. The operational fleet strength of the private sector was adversely affected by the immobilisation of vehicles on account of frequent repairs and mainten\u00adance. Consequently, the number of permits issued by the Department of Private Omnibus Transport to private operators declined to 9,170 when compared with 10,370 in 1986. For instance, 2,257 permits were issued to new buses in 1987, compared with 3,205 in 1986 and 4,128 in 1985. The Department of Motor Traffic records also show a con\u00adsiderable decline in the number of new registrations of private coaches. In 1987 there were only 1,062 such registrations in comparison to 1,781 in 1986.",
