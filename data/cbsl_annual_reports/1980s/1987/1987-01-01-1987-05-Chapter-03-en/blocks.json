Production performance in different elevations was highly uneven. Mid grown tea production increased marginally while the low grown tea produc\u00adtion rose by 7 per cent to reach 86.4 million kgs., the highest level ever on record..The low grown teas accounted for 41 per cent of the total production, compared with 38 per cent in 1986. Underlying this increasing trend in production was the new plantations of tea undertaken in low grown areas during early 1980s, mainly by small holders. In contrast, high grown tea production fell for the third consecutive year, declining by 5 per cent to 73.4 million kgs. in 1987. The drop in production was attributed mainly to drought conditions that prevailed in most of the major producing areas during the early part of the year.",

Tea production of the JEDBs, excluding tea produced with bought leaf, dropped by 2 per cent to 67.7 million kgs., while that of the SLSPCs fell by 5 per cent to 55.6 million kgs.

Replanting in the private sector plantations dropped significantly by 12 per cent to 3,492 hectares. This reflected the reluctance of rubber small holders to carry out replanting activities as sheet rubber fetched high prices throughout the year. The non-availability of plants which are less susceptible to \"corynespora leaf spot\" disease in sufficient quantities also had a bearing on replanting activities in 1987. The World Bank assisted Small Holding Rubber Rehabilitation Programme continued to cover Kegalle, Kalutara and Ratnapura districts in 1987.

This was the highest price level recorded in the recent past. The average prices of all varieties of sheet rubber and scrap crepe at the Colombo Auctions recorded subs\u00adtantial increases during 1987 when compared with those of 1986, while those of latex crepe rubber showed significant declines. One of the major developments at the Colombo Auctions in 1987 was the record price levels of Ribbed Smoked Sheets (RSS). The impor\u00adtant contributory factors for this development were the reduced domestic supplies due to unfavourable weather conditions and active demand resulting from low stocks with consumers and better performance of the automobile and tyre industries of developed countries and periodic low rubber output in major rubber producing countries, viz. Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. The other major development at the Colombo Auctions in 1987 was the active demand of domestic rubber manufacturers and exporters for off grade varieties of rubber. While the rubber small holders benefitted from the in\u00adcreased prices of sheet rubber, low prices of crepe rubber had a negative effect on the producer margins of the public sector estates. The producer margins of the JEDBs deteri\u00adorated from a positive margin of Rs. 3.36 per kg. in 1986 to a negative margin of Rs. 0.53 per kg. in 1987, while the positive margin of the SLSPCs dropped from Rs. 2.98 per kg. in 1986 to Rs. 1.17 per kg. in 1987.",

Reflecting the impact of favourable export prices, rehabilitation of cinnamon and new planting of pepper increas\u00aded substantially. The amount of subsidy paid under the Minor Export Crop Assistance Scheme increased by 16 per cent from Rs. 12 million in 1986 to Rs. 13.9 million in 1987. The export duties on minor agricultural products were also abolished by the Government in November, 1987 to provide a greater incentive for production and exports.",

However, sugar production at the Hingurana factory increased by 9 per cent to 8,640 metric tons in 1987. The sharp decline in total sugar production in the factories of the SLSC was mainly due to prolonged drought conditions which reduced supplies of cane for crushing and deteriorated the quality of cane. The production at Kantale factory suffered the most severe setback, since unfavourable weather conditions aggravated the slackening of output due to the breach of the Kantale dam. Civil disturb\u00adances also had an adverse effect on production at Kantale and Hingurana. A large extent under sugar cane was left unharvested during the year due to terrorist activities and short\u00adage of labour. Sugar production at the Pelwatte Sugar factory was also severely affected by the drought and the factory was able to produce only 14,269 metric tons in 1987 as against the targetted production of about 32,000 metric tons.",

Therefore, while making an effort to increase production, greater attention has to be focussed on the distribution of benefits to ensure that the benefits of these efforts reach the producers at large.

Also, the Central Bank recog\u00adnised the Commercial Bank of Sri Lanka as a participating bank in the scheme. The num\u00adber of Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies registered with the Central Bank for participation in the NCRCS Increased from 22 in 1986 to 29 in 1987. However, as in the past, the two state-owned banks, the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank, continued to be the main source of credit under the Scheme.",

The increase, to some extent, may be considered the result of the greater efforts made by all participating banks to disburse more credit with the revision of the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme, im\u00adplemented until Yala, 1986. The Credit Guarantee Scheme introduced by the Central Bank with effect from Yala, 1986 may also have had a bearing on this increase. The in-, crease in volume of credit in 1987 was confined to the Maha season, which more than offset the decline during the Yala season.",
