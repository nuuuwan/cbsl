Consequently, the deficit on trade account decreased by 18 per cent in 1987 as compared with the deficit in the previous year. This was the second consecutive year when the trade deficit declined.",

With this increase, the share of industrial exports in total exports rose to 49 per cent, thus further consolidating the success achieved in 1986 when industrial exports exceeded the value of agricultural exports which held the dominant position until then. This increase was largely reflected in the value of textile and garment exports which rose by as much as 16 per cent (34 per cent in Rupee terms), from Rs. 9,629 million (SDR 293 million) in 1986 to Rs. 12,897 million (SDR 339 million) in 1987. Earnings from other industrial exports of SDR 118 million were at about the same level as in the previous year, although there was an improvement of 16 per cent in Rupee terms, to Rs. 4,515 million. This compared adversely against the substantial increase of 33 per cent in 1986. The slower growth of earnings in 1987 was largely due to reduced receipts from fish products, chemical products, mechanical and electrical appliances. The value of petroleum products declined by 5 per cent in SDR terms, although there was an increase of earnings in Rupee terms by 10 per cent to Rs. 2,592 million in 1987.",

While the value of fertilizer imports decreased by as much as 16 per cent (28 per cent in SDR terms), that of wheat grain and chemicals dropped by 9 per cent (22 per cent in SDR terms) and 2 per cent (15 per cent in SDR terms), res\u00adpectively. However, these decreases were largely offset by an increase of 20 per cent (39 per cent in Rupee terms) in the value of petroleum imports, rising from Rs. 6,293 million (SDR 191 million) in 1986 to Rs. 8,716 million (SDR 229 million) in 1987. This reflected increases both in the average price as well as in the volume of crude \u2022oil imports in 1987. While the import volume increased from 12.1 million barrels in. 1986 to 13.1 million barrels in 1987, the average import price rose from SDR 13 per barrel to SDR 14 per barrel. Another noteworthy change was the increase in the value of textiles and clothing imports which rose fromRs. 6,353 million (SDR 193 million) in 1986 to Rs. 8,086 million (SDR 212 million) in 1987. Such imports were largely for meeting the requirements of the garments industry.!",

The decline in SDR terms was reflected in all categories of consumer goods imports. In particular, the imports of food and drink dropped by 5 per cent from SDR 205 million to S D R 196 million, largely on account of the sharp fall in rice imports, from SDR 32 million in 1986 to SDR 18 million in 1987. However, it should be noted that within this cate\u00adgory the outlay on sugar imports rose by 17 per cent, to SDR 63 million in 1987, owing to increases in both the average price as well as the import volume. The value of other consumer goods imports too dropped marginally from SDR 168 million in 1986 to SDR 167 million in 1987, due mainly to decreased imports of pharmaceuticals, radio receivers and television sets.",
