Within the services sector, banking, insurance, real estate and other services recorded higher growth rates. A 6 per cent growth was recorded in financial services in 1987 compared with 4 per cent in 1986, on account of an increase in the profits of the banking sector. The disruption of transport activities in the Nothern and Eastern. parts of Sri Lanka and the reduced haulage of agricultural commodities due to lower output levels contributed to the sluggish growth in the transport, storage and communications sector. Value-added in wholesale and retail trade rose by 2.8 per cent in 1987 compared with 3.9 per cent in 1986. Export trade increased marginally, while import trade expanded by 1.7 per cent. The reduced water supply in hydro-reservoirs in 1987 resulted in a 18 per cent drop in electricity generation through hydro-power, and this reduced the total electricity generation to a modest 2 per cent increase, contributing largely to a reduced growth in the electricity, gas, water and sanitary services sector.",
