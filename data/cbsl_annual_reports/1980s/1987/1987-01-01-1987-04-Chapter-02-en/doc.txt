GROSS NATIONAL P R O D U C T , INCOME A N D EXPENDITURE

Overall Trends

In 1987, Sri Lanka's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have increased by 1.5 per cent in real terms, compared with a growth of 4.3 per cent in

1986. The agricultural sector, which was most dominant in the Sri Lankan economy, performed poorly in 1987 owing largely to adverse weather conditions. The output of paddy and coconuts were the worse affected from the prolonged drought. The manufacturing sector, maintained its growth momentum in 1987 although at a lower rate than in the previous year. The construction sector along with the mining and quarrying sector, recorded higher rates of growth in 1987. The services sector expanded at a relatively slower rate.

The Gross National Product (GNP) at current factor cost prices was Rs. 173.4 billion in 1987, an increase of 8.5 per cent over 1986. The implicit G N P deflator, an indicator of the overall price changes in the economy, rose by 6.8 per cent in

1987, compared with an increase of 5.5 per cent in the previous year.

The mid-year population of Sri Lanka in 1987 has been provisionally estimated at 16.361 million, which reflects a 1.5 per cent growth over 1986. Accordingly, per-capita G N P at current prices is estimated at Rs. 10,598 (US.$.360). In real terms, the per-capita income is estimated to have increased marginally by 0.1 per cent, when compared with a 2.7 per cent growth in the previous year. The real national income, which is derived after adjusting for the terms of trade effect, increased by 2.1 per cent in the current year compared with the 3.1 per cent growth in the previous year.

Sectoral Performance

The sectoral composition of the G N P and the changes in value-added at constant prices are given in Table 1.6. The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector recorded a decline of 5.8 per cent in 1987. This was due to lower production levels in the two important crops, paddy and coconut. Although value-added in forestry and fisheries increased by 13 and 4 per cent, respectively, the value-added in agriculture declined by 8 per cent. In plantation agriculture, output of tea increased by 1 per cent, while output of rubber declined by 11 per cent and coconut by 25 per cent. In the food crop sub-sector, paddy production declined by 18 per cent.

The output in the mining and quarrying sector increased by 19 per cent in 1987, largely as an outcome of the expansion in the gem industry, as evident by increased exports. In 1987, the S D R value of gem exports increased by 65 per cent over the previous year.

The manufacturing sector recorded an over-all growth of 7 per cent in 1987. This was largely due to a growth of 8.3 per cent in factory industries, despite a 3 per cent decline in the output of state-owned industries. Following the pattern observed in previous years, the output in the textile, wearing apparel and leather products group recorded a high growth of 37 per cent in 1987. Export-oriented agricultural processing expanded by 4 per cent. This growth was mainly the result

of an increase in the export of packeted tea by 15 per cent in 1987, whereby such exports have now come to account for 40 per cent of Sri Lanka's tea exports. In the factory industries sub-sector, value-added in the private sector industries increased by 13 per cent in 1987 compared with 15 per cent in 1986.

The construction sector expanded by 1.8 per cent in 1987 compared with 1.5 per cent in 1986. The services sector expanded by 2.7 per cent compared with a growth- of 4.3 in 1986. Within the services sector, banking, insurance, real estate and other services recorded higher growth rates. A 6 per cent growth was recorded in financial services in 1987 compared with 4 per cent in 1986, on account of an increase in the profits of the banking sector. The disruption of transport activities in the Nothern and Eastern. parts of Sri Lanka and the reduced haulage of agricultural commodities due to lower output levels contributed to the sluggish growth in the transport, storage and communications sector. Value-added in wholesale and retail trade rose by 2.8 per cent in 1987 compared with 3.9 per cent in 1986. Export trade increased marginally, while import trade expanded by 1.7 per cent. The reduced water supply in hydro-reservoirs in 1987 resulted in a 18 per cent drop in electricity generation through hydro-power, and this reduced the total electricity generation to a modest 2 per cent increase, contributing largely to a reduced growth in the electricity, gas, water and sanitary services sector.

Value-added in public administration and defence increased by 3 per cent in 1987 compared with an increase of 19 per cent in 1986.

Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF), inclusive of changes in stocks at current prices, increased by 8 per cent in 1987, whereas in the previous year an increase of 9.8 per cent was recorded. The combined capital formation of private sector and public corporations rose by 5.6 per cent in 1987. The comparable increase in 1986 was 6.4 per cent. Gross Domestic Capital Formation by the central and local government expanded by 17 per cent in 1987 compared with a 23 per cent expansion in 1986.

Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation (GDFCF) at current prices recorded an increase of 8 per cent in 1987. The C L E value of import of capital goods (excluding building materials) rose by 10 per cent in 1987, compared with an increase of 2 per cent in 1986. Thus, a marginal increase in the import content of Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation was observed. Construction, inclusive of buildings, was the largest component in capital formation.

Capital formation in plant and machinery and other capital goods, at current prices increased by 5 per cent in 1987, and in transport equipment rose by 2 per cent. Land development, including replanting, declined by 14.3 per cent, largely on account of the drought.

Availability and Utilization of Resources

The total resources available to the Sri Lanka economy in 1987 were Rs. 266.9 billion. Domestic sources contributed Rs. 196.7 billion (73.7 per cent) to total resources, while the value of imports amounted to Rs. 70.2 billion (26.3 per cent). Of the total resources, 64.2 per cent was spent on consumption and 17.2 per cent on capital formation, while 18.6 per cent was exported as goods and non-factor services.

The total resource availability, valued at 1978 constant prices, increased by 0.5 per cent in 1987. Imports of goods and non-factor services declined by 1.9 per cent in 1987 over the previous year. Consumption expenditure, valued at constant prices, increased by 0.8 per cent, while capital formation declined by 0.4 per cent.

Domestic savings increased from Rs. 21.6 billion in 1986 to Rs. 25.2 billion in 1987. The ratio of domestic savings to GDP at market prices improved marginally from 12 per cent in 1986 to 12.8 per cent in 1987. Total national savings, which include net factor income and private transfers from abroad, was estimated at Rs. 30 billion in 1987. The national savings ratio in 1987 increased to 15.3 per cent from the previous year's ratio of 14.5 per cent.
