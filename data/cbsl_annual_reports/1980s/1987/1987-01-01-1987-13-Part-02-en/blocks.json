The total volume of loans granted under the NCRCS was Rs. 124 million in Yala 1987 compared with Rs. 151 million in Yala, 1986. In Maha 1986/87, the total value of loans granted was Rs. 257 million which is an improvement compared with Rs. 116 million granted in Maha, 1985/86.0ut of 41,390 fanners who received cultivation loans in 1986/87 Maha season, 1,920 farmers sought rescheduling facility offered under the NCRCS due to crop damage through natural causes. The amount of loans rescheduled was Rs. 7 million approximately. The credit guarantee was invoked in 1987 in respect of the loans granted in Yala, 1986. The total claim of the banks was Rs. 12.3 million, of which, according to the terms governing the credit guarantee, Rs. 6.1 million of 50 per cent was paid by the Central Bank as the first instalment of the claim. The balance is to be paid when the banks comply with the legal requirements regarding the recovery of overdue loans.",

The branch managers were allowed to dispense with the requirement of insisting on security in granting loans under NCRCS at their discretion. Certain conditions regarding the rescheduling of overdue cultivation loans were relaxed. In the case of recurrent crop losses, the borrowers were allowed to reschedule two consecutive loans and thereby remain elegible to receive a third loan to ensure the continuity of their agricultural operations. The Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. was also admitted to the Scheme in 1987 as a participating bank. The number of Thrift and Credit Co-operative Socie\u00adties registered for participation in the NCRCS increased from 20 to 29 during the year.",
