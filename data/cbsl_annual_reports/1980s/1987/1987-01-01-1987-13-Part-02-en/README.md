During the year, the Bank paid to contributors a sum of Rs. 3.3 million inclusive of interest.

A coin of Rs. 10 denomination was issued into circulation in April, 1987 in com­memoration of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.

BANKING DEVELOPMENT

The strengthening of (lie indigenous banking sector was a major feature in the field of banking development in 1987. A noteworthy change in the composition of the commercial banking sector took place in 1987 with the emergence of two new indigenous private banks. Of these iwo new banks, the Investment and Credit Bank Ltd., which subsequently changed its name to Sampath Bank Ltd., commenced business in March, 1987, thereby increasing the number of locally-incorporated com­mercial banks operating in the country to five and raising the number of private indi­genous banks to three. In December 1987, permission was granted under Section J2I(#) of the Monetary Law Act, for another locally incorporated private commercial bank to be established under the name Seylan Trust Bank Ltd. The total number of commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka as at end of 1987 amounted to 24 compris­ing 19 foreign banks and 5 local banks.

In the field of branch banking, a total of 5 bank branches were opened during the year 1982, of which three belonged to the two State Banks. The Bank of Ceylon opened a new branch at Galewela and upgraded its Rikillagaskade ASC branch to a main branch. The Oruwela branch of Bank of Ceylon was amalgamated with the Kaduweia branch and consequent on this, the Oruwela branch ceased to operate with effect from August 7, 1987. Accordingly, the number of main bank branches of the Bank of Ceylon which stood at 238 at the end of 1986 increased to 239 by the end of 1987. The People's Bank also opened a new branch at Ratnapura in January, 1987 bringing the total number of its branches to 298. The two branches established by the private local banks in 1987 consisted of the Head.Office branch of the Sampath Bank Ltd., at Colombo 10, and the Hatton National Bank's branch at Kalutara. With these changes in respect of the establishment of new branches and the rationalization of existing branches the total number of main bank branches of commercial banks rose from 604 at the end of 1986 to 608 by the end of 1987.

During 1987,4 new RRDBs were established in the districts of Kegalle, Puttalam, Galle and Kandy, bringing the total number of RRDBs to 9 as at the end of the year. The number of RRDB branches rose by 29 during the year under review. At the end of the year, there were 61 branches.

The National Savings Bank also contributed to the expansion of banking network in the country by opening two new branches during 1987 at Borejla. and Hakmana bringing the total number of its branches to 62 by the end of 1987.

I is )

The Central Bank continued 10 pursue its policy of modernisation of commercial banking services in Sri Lanka by finalising arrangements such as installation of the necessary equipments and recruitment of additional staiT in regard to the Automated Cheque Clearing System to speed up clearing operations of cheques.

BANK SUPERVISION

Commercial Banks

Fxaniimuious of seven commercial bunk* which had commenced in 1986 were concluded in 1987. Examination;; of eight commercial banks (including two RRDBs) were commenced in 1987 and of these, three were concluded. The examination period 1986/87 has been extended by one year up to 1988. The Bank continued to monitor the financial condition of commercial banks on the basis of monthly statements of assets and liabilities furnished by them. The profitability of commercial banks in 1986 was also analysed on the basis of returns furnished by them. The Bank also monitored on a semi-annual basis, the training provided by foreign banks operating in Sri Lanka to their employees.

A direction for the segregation of non-performing advances from regular advances and instructions against accrued interest on such advances being takv.n to profits was issued in 1987. This would facilitate more accurate monitoring of the financial condition and profitability of commercial banks.

The Bank continued its programme of monitoring the transactions of Foreign Currency Banking Units established by commercial banks under the Foreign Currency Banking Scheme.

A Deposit Insurance Scheme to cover commercial banks, RRDBs and Co­operative Rural Banks was inaugurated in 1987 by the Central Bank.

Finance Companies

The total number of finance companies registered with the Central Bank as at December 31, 1987 amounted to 71. During the year under review, five applications were received by the Bank for registration. However, only one company was regis­tered, while the applications of two companies were turned down since these com­panies did i.oi conform to the previsions of the Control of Finance Companies-Act

( C F C A ) No. 11 c-C !979.

Licences issued to two finance companies registered with the Central Bank were cancelled by ihe Bank since they were not carrying on business as defined in the C F C A . The Monetary Board approved the suspension of the business of six companies and subsequently, live of them were granted permission to resume business subject to specific terms and conditions. An application has been filed in u.e Courts for the liquidation of Ihe remaining company. The Bank also took preliminary steps to institute legal action against the directors of eerui.n finance companies for violation of direct ions given by the Monetary Board.

( * )

During the year under review, 42 finance companies were examined under Section 15(1) of the Act. The monthly statements of assets and liabilities and annual profit and loss accounts and balance sheets furnished by finance companies were analysed, paying particular attention to compliance by them of the directions given by the Monetary Board in respect of the required levels of liquid assets and capital funds.

In December 1987, the Bank issued directions to finance companies imposing restrictions on rales of interest and other charges. Under these directions, the maxi­mum rate of interest payable on a deposit with a maturity period of not more than 12 months was fixed at 17 per cent per annum. For deposits with a maturity period exceeding 12 months, the maximum interest payable was limited to 18 per cent per annum. In terms of these directions, finance companies were also required to charge interest on all loans and advances on the reducing balance. Further, the directions required finance companies to disburse advances and loans without deducting any amount in respect of repayment: of principal, interest or other charges.

In response to a decision made by the District Court of Colombo in February, 1987, the Bank took preliminary measures to liquidate the Sevana Finance and Investments Co. Ltd., which was found insolvent.

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE

During 1987, the Central Bank continued its activities relating to the promotion of medium and long-term finance for industry, agriculture, and services. The emphasis in 1987, however, shifted from Medium and Longrterm refinance to. entrepreneurship' development and rehabilitation of sick industries. The Bank who continued to implement the package of relief measures granted to the tourist hotel sector. The operations under the SMI-II Credit Guarantee Scheme with disbursements to be concluded in 1987, gathered momentum towards the end of the year.

The Bank commenced its Entrepreneurship Development Programme in January, 1987 consisting of three major areas awareness programmes for school leavers, programmes for potential entrepreneurs and those for existing entrepreneurs to upgrade their management and technology. The first programme was conducted at Hettimulla in February, 1987. This was followed by five other programmes in Chilaw, Kandy, Galle, Kuliyapitiya and Girandurukotte. These included four pro­grammes for school leavers and two programmes aimed at upgrading of manage­ment.

Approval of refinance under Categories II, III and IV of the Medium and Long-term Credit Fund (MLCF) of the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 134.7 million in 1987, a considerable decrease, when compared with the Rs. 442.8 million approved in the previous year. The decline -was largely a result of the lower level of approvals for the rehabilitation of hotels in the tourist sector. Approvals of refinance to the export and agricultural sectors also remained below 1986 levels and amounted to Rs. 25.8 million and Rs. 23.0 million, respectively. A breakdown of refinance appro­vals is shown in Table 2.3

Since most of the hotels made use of this facility during 1985 and 1986 requests for rescheduling in 1987 remained at a relatively lower level. Assistance under this scheme during 1987 was confined to the capitalisation of interest in arrears on loans granted to 39_hotel porojects.

' Credit Guarantee Operations

A summary of the credit guarantee operations under the three credit guarantee schemes administered by the Bank is given in Table 2.5

Small Scale Industries (SSI) Scheme

The Central Bank commenced the SSI Credit Guarantee Scheme on behalf of the government in 1978 and the issue of credit guarantees under the Scheme was com­pleted by the end of 1981. A total of 767 loans with a loan value of Rs. 31.2 million was guaranteed by the Bank during this period. Of these, 108 loans with a loan balance of Rs. 2.5 million were outstanding at the beginning of the year 1987 and 16 of them ware repaid fully during the year. In 1987, one guarantee was withdrawn while claims under 5 guarantees were settled leaving 86 guarantees with a loan balance of Rs. 2.2 million outstanding at the end of the year. All these loans except 8,were in arrears but only in respect of 8 loans that claims had been submitted. By the end of the year, using funds allocated from the Government Budget for the purpose, the Central Bank had settled a total of 55 claims under this Scheme by paying Rs. 1.7 million to the two participating credit institutions (PCIs), the People's Bank and the Bank of Ceylon. Only seven claims were pending at the end of the year, of which three were deferred as loans were being repaid by the borrowers while the other four were pending as the information requested from the PCIs had not been furnished. The premium collected by the Central Bank from the "PCIs under the Scheme~upto the end of 1987 amounted to Rs. 0.91 million. Small and Medium Industry (SMI-I) Scheme

Under the SMI-I Credit Guarantee Scheme, a total of 1,668 guarantees were issued by the Central Bank between 1979 and 1984 and 452 of them were outstanding with a loan balance of Rs. 63.9 million at the end of 1987. During the year under re? view, 90 loans were fully recovered and 27 claims were settled.

The number of loans in default at the end of the year stood at 354 and they amounted to Rs. 48.7 million. By the end of 1987, the Central Bank had paid a total of Rs. 11.5 million to four PCIs in settlement of 150 claims under the Scheme. Two claims with a liability of approximately Rs. 2.0 million were rejected increasing the total number of rejected claims to 15. At the end of the year, there were 52 claims with a claim liability of Rs. 4.3 million awaiting to be admitted for settlement. The total premium collected under this Scheme amounted to Rs. 10.6 million at the end of the year.

Small and Medium Industry-II (SMI-IT) Scheme

The SMi-II Credit Guarantee Scheme commenced in 1982. The disoursemenl of loans under this Scheme was to be completed in 1987 and PCIs accelarated their lending resulting an increase of guarantee applications (642) during the year with a loan value of Rs. 365.4 million increasing the total number of guarantees'issued under the SMI-II Scheme to 2,182. By the end of the year, 67 loans with an aggregate value

Follow-up and Inspection of Projects

The follow-up and inspection of projects financed under the M L C F and the SMJ schemes were continued in 1987 in order to ascertain the levels of rjerfonnance in the projects. The follow-up work enabled the Central Bank to identify corrective actions where necessary. The majority of the 87 SMI projects inspected during 1987 was those located in Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts.

RURAL CREDIT

As in the previous years, the Central Bank played a pivotal role in promoting rural credit in the country during 1987. The activities of the^ank covered areas such as preparation of national policy guidelines, formulation of credit schemes, monitoring, supervision and evaluation of the credit schemes and the promotion and development of the institutional infrastructure required for implementation of an effective rural credit policy.

The Rural Credit Advisory Board (RCAB) held five meetings in 1987. For the first time, the Board held a meeting outside Colombo. The meeting coincided with a visit to the Nikaweratiya Electorate in the Puttalam District which was experiencing a severe drought at the time of the visit. The Board met the farmers at various places and discussed their problems. Several important issues relating to the promotion of rural credit in the country were discussed at the meetings of the Board. One of the areas that engaged the attention of the Board was the provision of credit for the tea sector, particularly the small holders and private tea factory owners who have been experiencing

severe difficulties due to the erratic behaviour of prices. The need for special assistance to this sector was accepted in principle by the Board which requested the Central Bank

lo evolve a comprehensive credit package for the tea sector. During the year, the Board also considered a credit scheme for popularising the use of solar panels in rural electrification to benefit the remote areas of the country, not served with electi-city from the national grid and, discussed a programme for the promotion of dairy industry in Kalutara district through the establishment of service farms for upgrad­ing animals. A request from the Anuradhapura Milk Producers Union to provide incentives for milk producers also drew the attention of the Board in 1987. Further, the Board reviewed the Scheme for Provision of Credit for Sugarcane Farmers in Sevanagala, and the Scheme for the Promotion of Credit for Purchase of Soyabean, Maize and other Pulses by the Ceylon Oils and Fats Corporation (COFC).

The Central Bank continued the implementation of the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) in 1987. The total volume of loans granted under the NCRCS was Rs. 124 million in Yala 1987 compared with Rs. 151 million in Yala, 1986. In Maha 1986/87, the total value of loans granted was Rs. 257 million which is an improvement compared with Rs. 116 million granted in Maha, 1985/86.0ut of 41,390 fanners who received cultivation loans in 1986/87 Maha season, 1,920 farmers sought rescheduling facility offered under the NCRCS due to crop damage through natural causes. The amount of loans rescheduled was Rs. 7 million approximately. The credit guarantee was invoked in 1987 in respect of the loans granted in Yala, 1986. The total claim of the banks was Rs. 12.3 million, of which, according to the terms governing the credit guarantee, Rs. 6.1 million of 50 per cent was paid by the Central Bank as the first instalment of the claim. The balance is to be paid when the banks comply with the legal requirements regarding the recovery of overdue loans.

In the light of the experience gained during the operation of the Scheme, certain modifications and changes were introduced to the NCRCS during the year. The branch managers were allowed to dispense with the requirement of insisting on security in granting loans under NCRCS at their discretion. Certain conditions regarding the rescheduling of overdue cultivation loans were relaxed. In the case of recurrent crop losses, the borrowers were allowed to reschedule two consecutive loans and thereby remain elegible to receive a third loan to ensure the continuity of their agricultural operations. The Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. was also admitted to the Scheme in 1987 as a participating bank. The number of Thrift and Credit Co-operative Socie­ties registered for participation in the NCRCS increased from 20 to 29 during the year.

( xvi )

The Marketing Loan Scheme for Financing the Purchase of Maize, Soya beans, Pulses and Other Coarse Grains required for production of livestock feed and vege­table oils by the COFC was in operation in 1987 and Rs. 75 million was granted as loans during the year. However, in view of the failure of the COFC to operate the scheme in the manner envisaged to ensure payment of a guaranteed price at the farm gate, the Scheme was suspended until a long-term solution is evolved by the concerned agencies to achieve this objective.

During the year under review, two new credit schemes were introduced to provide medium and long-term credit to the rural sector. A credit scheme was commenced under the Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development Project (IRDP). An allo­cation of Rs. 50 million out of the proceeds of the loan had been made to support lending undertaken by banks for activities such as cultivation of paddy, subsidiary food crops and banana, farm investments (dairy, minor export crop nurseries, coconut fertilizer, farm machinery and equipment) and cotage and small scale industries. The other new scheme introduced in 1987 was the Credit Scheme for Outgrowers of Sugarcane in Pelwatte Sugar Project. Under this scheme, the Central Bank refinances the loans granted by Bank of Ceylon to outgrowers to Ihe extent of 100 per cent of the sub-loan. An allocation of Rs. 39.3 million has been made by the Central Bank for this Scheme.

Several extensions and modifications were also made to existing cicdil schemes in 1987. Badulla IRDP Loan Scheme and the Matale-Puttalam Districts I R D P L/«m Scheme scheduled to be terminated in 1987 were extended by one year to facilitat.-the use of the unutilised resources available under those schemes. The date of termi­nation of the Credit Scheme to Assist Estate Sector Women, in Income Generating Activities was also extended from 1987 upto end of 1988.

The Bank revised the eligibility criteria under the Coconut Fertilizer Credit Scheme to make eligible the holdings above 50 acres co-owned or managed by private companies provided the maximum size of the share of the holding of each individual does not exceed 50 acres. In the case of the Sri Lanka/Asian Development Bank (ADB) Livestock Development Project, the component of the Project relating to the Credit for Livestock Producers' Societies came into operation in 1987.

Several credit schemes which had either been completed or for which there was no demand from participating banks were terminated. These included the Credit Scheme for Cultivation of Orchids (Bank of Ceylon/Ceylon Tobacco Company Ltd.). Tank Irrigation Modernisation Project, Farm Machinery Loan Scheme for the Kurunegala District Integrated Rural Devel6pment Project, Abudhabi Funded North West Coast Fisheries Development Project, Credit Scheme for Cultivation of Orchid Plants (People's Bank/Sarvodaya/Lakmalsala) and the Credit Scheme for Financing Windmills. The Loan Scheme for the Dairy Development (Pilot) Project in Samanthurai Electorate and the Credit Scheme to Assist Settlers in the Minipe Scheme for the Instal­lation of Bio-gas plants were incorporated in the All Island Dairy Development Loan Scheme.

( XVU )

The progress in the implementation of existing Medium and Long-term Credit Scheme assisted with Central Bank refinance from its Medium and Long-term Credit Fund (MLCF) Category 1 is given in Table 2.7.

There were 29 Medium and Long-term Credit Schemes in operation in the year 1987 with a total allocation of Rs. 1,115 million for the provision of refinance in respect of loans granted under these schemes. The total quantum of refinance utilised by the participating banks under these schemes stood at Rs. 434 million or 39 per cent of the total allocation as at the end of the year. Among the schemes showing a satisfactory rate of utilisation during the year were the Coconut Fertilizer Credit Scheme (62 per cent), Matale-Puttalam IRDP Credit Scheme (75 per cent), All Island Farm Machinery Loan Scheme (59 per cent) and Self-Employment Credit Schemes in the districts of Anuradhapura ( ioo per cent as at the end of November, 1987), Matara (100 per cent), Kalutara and Kurimegala (73 per cent.) The allocation made for the Anuradhapura Self-Employment Scheme was exhausted in 19&7 and a fresh allocation of Rs. 6 million was made towards the end of the year. Similarly, a new allocation of Rs. 10 million was made for the Matara Self-Employment Scheme in late 1987. The refinance allocation for the All Island Farm Machinery Loan Scheme was also increased by Rs. 20 million during the year.

As in the previous years, the banks were reluctant to lend itQ the fisheries sector owing to the poor rates of recovery achieved in the past. The Central Banjr. introduced a rescheduling scheme for loans granted under the Fisheries Sector Bank Credit Scheme with a view to assisting the banks to overcome the problems faced due to high incidence of default on such loans.

With a view to assisting the lending banks by providing a degree of protection against possible losses in their investment credit for the rural sector, in 1987 the Central Bank decided to bring several designated Medium and Long-term Credit Schemes also under a Credit Guarantee Scheme. Initially, the All Island Dairy Development Loan Scheme and the Sri Lanka - ADB Livestock Development Project Loan Scheme were brought under the Credit Guarantee Scheme. The Credit Guarantee Fund created in 1985 with an initial contribution of Rs. 300 million from the Central Bank for guaranteeing loans granted for short-term cultivation purposes will serve as the common fund for guaranteeing medium and long-term loans granted under designa­ted M L C F Credit Schemes also.

Several Missions from the I F A D arrived in 1987 for identification appraisal and formulation of a Rural Credit Project for the small farmeffs.and the landless in several districts. In July, 1987, a memorandum of understanding between the Government of Sri Lanka and the IFAD Mission was prepared which formed the basis for loan appraisal. Loan negotiations for the Project are expected to take place in 1988. At the request of the government of Sri Lanka and the ADB, a Mission from the F A O Investment Centre also visited Sri Lanka in 1987 in order to analyse the rural credit situation and to propose recommendations for improvements.

During the year, the Central Bank completed the inspection of the agricultural loan portfolio of 4 branches of Bank of Ceylon, 4 branches of People's Bank, 3 Co-

The inspection reports were forwarded to the Head Offices of the respective banks, District/Regional Offices and to the branches inspected, recommending courses of action for rectification of deficiencies observed and for improving rural lendings. The Bank also followed up these inspections with compliance reports from the bank branches inspected.

REGIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS (RRDBs)

During 1987, 4 RRDBs were established in the districts of Kegalle, Puttalam, Galle and Kandy bringing the total number of RRDBs in operation to 9 as at the end of 1987. As shown in Table 2.8, these 9 RRDBs expanded their branch network to 61 with 29 new branches opened during the year under review.

The year 1987 witnessed a considerable expansion .in activities of the RRDBs The mobilisation of deposits exhibited a more than two-fold increase while lending increased by nearly one and a half times during the year compared with the position as at end of 1986. Several RRDBs diversified their activities with die introduction of pawn broking and current account operations.

The total value of deposits mobilised by 9 RRDBs as at December 31, 1987 reached Rs. 53 million encompassing 87,978 deposits compared with Rs. 21 million and 41,174 deposits as at end of 1986, respectively. The average value of deposits rose from Rs. 501 in 1986 to Rs. 6Q2 in 1987 when both savings and fixed deposits are considered together. The composition of total deposits in value terms indicated that more than 83 per cent had been in savings accounts leaving the balance of about 17 per cent in fixed deposits. In terms of the number of deposits, 87,312 or 99 per

cent represented savings accounts which can be considered as a proxy for the total number of customers served by the 9 RRDBs in 1987. Table 2.9 gives detailed infor­mation in regard to mobilisation of savings and fixed deposits by each RRDB.

The loan operations of the RRDBs expanded rapidly from 8,243 loans in 1986 to 13,801 loans in 1987. The value of total loans granted during 1987 was Rs. 96.1 million which reflected an increase of 47 per cent when compared with the postion of the previous year. The total number of loans disbursed showed an increase of 67 per cent. Detailed information on loans granted by each RRDB is given in Table 2.10. The spread of loans by purpose revealed that there was a considerable diversion of loans to non-agricultural activities while the low average size of loans reflected the concerted effort made by the RRDBs to cater to the needs of the small borrowers. Although there has been a noticeable variation in the purpose-wise lending operation from one RRDB to another, taken to­gether, agricultural loans which included cultivation, farm equipment, and other types accounted for about 36 per cent of the total loans, in 1987. A further 7 per cent had been for livestock while loans to small industries constituted about 16 per cent of the

total loan portfolio. The share of loans to trade and business activities reflected 35 per cent. There has not been a significant change in purpose-wise distribution of loans in 1987 compared with that of 1986, as shown in Table 2.11.

In view of the relatively low level of resources available to RRDBs and their commitment to assist the small borrowers who are not normally the target group of other commercial banks, the RRDBs have been concentrating on small loans cater-

( xxm )

ing to small farmers, small entrepreneurs and other small borrowers. The RRDBs have used nithods such as 'Janahamuwa' or local level meetings and field visits to disseminate information, educate borrowers and improve their access to credit. The experience of RRDBs so far has been encouraging as they have contributed to en­hancing income generating and self employment opportunities in turn, promoting rural development. They have also been able to maintain a high recovery rate mainly due to effective supervision of credit through field officers.

RURAL BANKING AND STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

In 1987 the Rural Banking and Staff Training College organized and conducted 42 training courses and seminars in which 928 persons participated. Of the total number of participants, 273 were from commercial banks ,225 from Regional Rural Development Banks and 146 from the Central Bank. Almost all participants were in

the middle or lower management strata in the banking sector.

The training provided by the College was in areas such as financing of agri­cultural and small industrial projects, commercial credit and financial analysis, market­ing, foreign exchange operations, off-shore banking, international trade financing and specialized managerial programmes related to human resources management and managerial development. During 1987 several changes were also introduced to the curriculum by including subjects such as human resource management and entre­preneurship development.

( XXIV )

In 1987, the College organized and conducted 17 training programmes outside Colombo. Four of these programmes were organised for the benefit of the small-scale entrepreneurs in the private sector with a view to promoting their management skills. Six of the outstation programmes were conducted for recruits to the Regional Rural -Development Banks.

Two of the training programmes conducted outside Colombo were for the staff of the participating banks in the Kirindi-Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project-Phase II. In response to a request made by the Ministry of Education, a 4-day seminar for Teachers'/Instructors of the Ministry of Education was also conducted.

The College completed its 6th year of operation in September, 1987. T h e sixth anniversary lecture was delivered by Mr. Kamchorn Sathirakul, Governor, Bank of Thailand, on the topic 'The Role of Financial Institutions in Rival Development: The Thai Experience' to an invited gathering of executives of banks, financial institu­tions, ministries and government departments.

EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is charged with the responsibility of receiving contributions, surcharges and income from the investment of monies of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), maintaining proper accounts of registered employers and the individual members of the Fund and effecting refund of benefits to the members in terms of provisions of the EPF Act. The Bank carries out these activities in close co-operation with the Employees' Provident Fund Division of the Department of Labour which attends to the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the EPF Act.

Contributions

The contributions received by the Fund during 1987 amounted to Rs. 2,194.3 million as against Rs. 2,047.9 million in 1986. This represents an increase of Rs. 146.4 million or 7.1 per cent over the contributions received during the previous year.

Members' Balances

Members', balances as at December 31, 1987 before allocation of interest for the year under review, stood at Rs. 20,061.5 million which is an increase of Rs. 3,659.4 million or 22.3 per cent over the balance as at end of 1986.

( XXV

Investments

During the year under review, the Fund invested a total amount of Rs. 4,409.7 million in Government Securities, Treasury Bills and in Rupee Loan stock held by the Sinking Funds of the two National Housing Debentures. When compared with Rs. 6,138.0 million invested in 1986,this was a decrease of Rs. 1,728.3 million. This was mainly due to the increase in the amount of EPF benefits paid to members by 62.6 per cent over the 1986 benefits and the reduction in maturity proceeds received during 1987 as compared to 1986. The total investments made during the year under review included a sum of Rs. 493.9 million representing maturity proceeds of earlier investments and Treasury Bills. The total amount invested in Government Securities amounted, to Rs. 4,227.7 million which represented 60.4 per cent of the total securities issued by the Government of Sri Lanka during the year, 1987. The amount invested in Treasury Bills during the year amounted to Rs. 171.0 million. At the end of the year under review, the Fund did not hold any Treasury Bills, as they had matured at various intervals during the year. The total investments held by the Fund as at December 31, 1987, amounted to Rs. 21,634.0 million, which is an increase of Rs. 3,915.4 million over the level of 1986. This included a sum of Rs. 10.6 million invested in Rupee Loan stock held by the Sinking Funds of the National Housing Debentures.

Income Received from Investments

In 1987, the income from investments of the Fund amounted to Rs. 2,378.9 million as against Rs. 1,953.5 million in 1986, recording an increase of Rs. 425.4 million or 21.8 per cent.

Refunds

The total sum paid out by way of refund of EPF benefits to members during the year 1987, amounted to Rs. 573.6 million as against Rs. 352.7 million in 1986. recording an increase of Rs. 220.9 million or 63 per cent. During the year under re­view, 34,530 claims for refund of benefits were paid out, which included 364 claims from repatriates of Indian origin.

Interest on Members' Balances

The Employees' Provident Fund is required to pay interest on members' balances as at end of each year out of the income from investment of monies of the Fund. The rate of interest payable on members' balances as at end of 1987 remained at 12.5 per cent per annum as in the previous year. However, the effective rate of interest is higher than the above rate as the interest is calculated on the year-end balance irrespective of whether the current year's contributions had remained to the credit of the member for the full year or not.

Recording of Balances in EPF Account Books

Recording of balances in EPF Account Books issued by the Department of Labour continued during the year under review. However, the issue of Annual Statements indicating the members* balances as at end of 1986.continued to be despatched as was done, in the pasl.

R E G I O N A L O F F I C E — A N U R A D H A P U R A

During 1987, the Anuradhapara Regional Office continued its activities > relating to promotion of both Short-term and long & medium-term credit for a wide array of activities within the district. The Regional Office continued to provide guidance and extension support to borrowers covering financial, managerial and technical aspects on an increasing scale. Training programmes were extended to cover a wider section of the population. More than 2,000 persons have undergone training facilities under the Central Bank programmes. Increasing number of village meetings, discussions, workshops, etc., have been conducted during the year, in an effort to deliver the message of development banking to the masses. The Bank also assisted a number of other institutions such as the Ministry of Plan Implementation, the Women's Bureau, Ministry of Youth and Employment and the Industrial Develop­ment Board in carrying out their training programmes.

,An agricultural competition was conducted for the second year in succession, ini which the benefits accruing to the borrowers who followed the training programmes were clearly evident. The competition .has motivated a large number of farmers to undertake intensive cultivation practices to secure a better income.

When compared with the previous years's record, in 1987 the Regional Office was able to recommend a larger number of projects involving a much large volume of credit

In addition the Regional Office played an important role in promoting short-term production loans for paddy and a variety of subsidiary food crops under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS). The Regional Office sponsored 696 such loans amounting to Rs. 3.3 million in respect of 1,646 acres during the culri-

i XXXIV )

valion year 1987. These loans were extended by the branches of the Bank of Ceylon, the People's Bank and the Anuradhapura Regional Rural Development Bank. It was further evident during the year that with careful monitoring, education of farmer-borrowers and continuous guidance the flow of credit can be increased with better recovery rates as well.

Performance of Medium and Long-term Projects

The main objectives of the Regional Office were to increase production, income and employment opportunities by enhancing the flow of institutional credit to eco­nomic activities. The total number of projects identified up to the end of 1987 by the Regional Office stood at 2,160 and 806 of them have been approved for financing by the lending banks. The projects in operation have shown encouraging performance in relation to the above objectives.

Income and Employment

The total income generated by the projects in operation during the year is esi i-mated at Rs. 27.5 million. A Sector-wise analysis proves that agricultural projects have generated a higher and steady income. Leaving out the most progressive farmers who earned a much higher income the majority of the projects averaged an income of Rs. 10,000 to 15,000 in each season, particularly during the off season with the cultivation of 1-2 acres of cash crops with water from dug wells.

The small scale industrial and service sector projects have shown a greater capacity over agricultural projects in generating employment. Employment per project in some of the well managed industrial projects amounted to 8 persons. Details on income and employment generation are given in Table 2.18.

Loan Repayment

Table 2.19 provides a summary of the repayment of loans of the Medium and Long-term Credit Programme.

The agricultural sector projects have recorded the highest repayment rate of over 90 per cent while the service sector recorded a repayment rate of 87 per cent. The repayment rates of Industry and Livestock loans were 84 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively. Failure of livestock projects in the field of poultry has been the major contributory factor for the lower repayment rate of livestock loans.

Agricultural Training Programmes, Seminars/Workshops

With the emphasis1 on the need for intensifying cultivation practices, using better technology, various trammg. programmes were designed and carried out regularly by the Regional Office. During the year under review 9 such programmes benefitting over 500 fanners were conducted in different parts of the district. In addition more than 65 village meetings were also organised during the year to increase the awareness of development potential in rural areas and improve the access to institutional credit faculties for a larger segment of the community.

Issae of Treasury Bilk

During the year under review, the total contribution to Treasury bills by the banks in the district amounted to Rs. 230.2 million. This was a marked increase when compared with the last year's contribution. The main contributor was the People's Bank.

Local Clearing House

The Clearing House at the Regional Office continued to provide clearing faci­lities to the banks in the region. During the year, cheques to the value of Rs. 242 million were cleared.

( XXXVI )

REGIONAL OFFICE—MATALE

During 1987, the Regional Office at Matale continued its activities with a view to promoting rural credit and thereby rural development. Its activities included project identification and appraisal, recommendation of projects for bank financing, conduct of training programmes and monitoring of bank financed projects. During the year, particular emphasis was placed on the weaker sections of the rural society with a view to assisting them to improve their economic conditions. Table 2.20 provides a summary of the credit operations relating to the refinance loan schemes implemented and monitored by the Regional Office during the year under review.

Yala Cultivation Season—1987

Owing to the severe drought which adversely affected paddy cultivation during Ji986/87 Maha season many farmers were unable to repay their bank loans and be­came ineligible for fresh loans during Yala, 1987. However, the Regional [Office made an effort to increase the flow of paddy cultivation loans during the season to eligible farmers through various measures. During the season the Office organised 16 Credit Camps in the district and recommended 682 loans amounting to Rs. 2.6 million for cultivation of paddy and minor food crops. The recovery rate of Yala, 1987 loans has been estimated at 67.5 per cent as at end of 1987.

Maha Cultivation Season—1987/88

During the 1987/88 Maha season, the number of Credit Camps was increased to 21 and a wider geographical area was covered by the Camps. Some of these Camps Have benefited particularly those farmers who are in remote, difficult areas in the

( XXXVII )

district and contributed towards reduction of thi:ir transaction costs of obtaining loans from the banks. In respect of the 1987/88 Maha season, 997 loans amounting to Rs. 4.7 million have been released for the cultivation of paddy and minor food crops under the NCRCS.

Medium and Long-term Refinance Loan Schemes

The Regional Office continued to implement and monitor a number of Medium and Long-term Refinance Loan Schemes. Of these, the Self-employment Loan Scheme was perhaps the most important. The main objectives of this loan scheme were to raise the level of employment, production and incomes in the region. During the year, 502 self-employment projects were approved and directed to the banks for financing. In addition to assistance granted for obtaining finance, the office also made an effort to help the owners of the small enterprises to resolve their marketing and raw material problems. Among the other Medium and Long-term Credit Schemes, the Dairy Development Credit Scheme and the All Island Farm Machinery Loan Scheme werr important. In all these schemes the repayment rates were about 99 per cent.

Training and Publicity Activities

The Regional Office organised a number of meetings and seminars to educate potential borrowers about the Self-employment Loan Scheme and various other banking facilities. Several training programmes were also conducted in small industry, poultry keeping and dairy farming.

Issue of Treasury Bills

During the year under review, the Regional Office was able to market Treasury Bills to the value of Rs. 219.5 million. The district-wise breakdown of the issues is given in Table 2.21.

SURVEYS

Consumer Finances and Socio-Economic Survey—1986/87

The Bank completed the enumeration work of the Consumer Finances and Socio­economic Survey, 1986/87 which commenced in October, 1986. The Survey was con­ducted in 4 rounds during a period of 12 months. The main objective of the survey was to generate comprehensive data on consumer finances and socio-economic conditions of the household sector in the country.

Survey of Business Activities and Planned Investments

The Survey of Business Activities and Planned Investments is conducted on an annual basis in order to ascertain the structure of the investment, its direction, the extent of planning, sources and uses of funds and the volume of investment. The re­port on the Survey of Business Activities and Planned Investments for the period 1983/84 to 1985/86 was published in October, 1987. Data collections for the next survey covering the period 1984/85 to 1986/87 has also been completed and the report on the findings will be published in 1988.

Country-wide Data Collection System

The Bank continued to collect data under the Country-wide Data Collection System which has been in operation since the last quarter of 1978. Information on retail prices of over 200 consumer items, producer prices of a wide range of items retail prices of agricultural inputs and activity-wise daily wage rates in paddy culti­vation, tea, rubber and coconut small holdings as well as small scale construction activities is collected from around 100 selected centres scattered in the Island. Data so collected are published together with a brief analysis in the annual publication— "Price and Wage Statistics—Retail Producer and Input Prices and Wages."

Monitoring of Import Liberalization Programme

The Bank continued to monitor imports under the imports liberalization programme by obtaining monthly data on Letters of Credit and Bills received against Letters of Credit. These data and analytical notes based on the data were made avail­able to the relevant authorities on a regular basis.

TRAINING

During the year under review the Bank continued the policy of training its officers in academic as well as non-academic fields. Academic Courses which were confined to postgraduate studies in Economics, Statistics, Computer Science and allied fields at universities abroad and Sri Lanka were arranged during the course of the year. These covered courses leading to Masters and Ph.D. degrees. A total of 6 officers proceeded on postgraduate studies abroad during the year while 3 officers followed postgraduate studies in Sri Lanka.

( XLI )

Training in non-academic fields related to practical short-term training courses, seminars, workshops, study tours,visits, etcinainly covered the areas in Rural Develop­ment, Agricultural and Industrial Credit, Banking and Computer Studies both local and foreign. In all, 98 officers proceeded abroad on short-term training during the year, while another 297 officers participated in local training courses. The in-service training programmes on commercial banking practices and operations for Central Bank officers at the People's Bank and Bank of Ceylon also continued during 1987. In addition to these training programmes the Bank also coordinated the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) training course on Financial System and Banking which was the first in the series and held in Colombo from October 7-November 5,1987.

D A T A P R O C E S S I N G

During 1987, the Bank, whilst improving facilities for the existing applications, made an effort to asses and plan its data processing requirements for the next 5 to 10 years. Also the Bank placed considerable emphasis on new developments such as the Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House Project, Consumer Finance Survey, Econo­mic Database Project and Introduction of Computing Equipment into User Depart­ments. Further the Bank played a vital role in work connected with the accelerated computerization programme for the Central Bank activities which have not yet been computerised. Details on these tasks are given below :

1. Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House

The Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House (SLACH) Project was commenced in 1986. The primary objective of the project is to replace the manual cheque clearing arrangements in Colombo with more modern and advanced techniques.

A new office was established with special computing equipment. Recruitment and training of staff and installation and testing of the computer hardware and software took palce during 1987.

By the end of 1987 the SLACH was nearly ready to take over the Colombo inter bank clearing activities, and was awaiting an adequate percentage of cheques with MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition ) codes, to be in circulation. The SLACH will begin to function in early 1988. It will provide a system for faster proces­sing of cheques and be able to handle an increased volume of cheques in the future without enhancing resources. Also, it will eliminate human errors during sorting and provide a more comprehensive system to the banks. The (entire project m a y b e considered a major step towards banking automation and electronic funds transfer in Sri Lanka which is the current trend in the banking industry in the World.

2. Consumer Finance Survey

The design and development of systems and programmes for editing and updat­ing of the data collected in the Consumer Finance and Socio-Economic Survey, 1986/ 87 was completed during 1987. The data entry of various schedules was also completed.

( XLII )

Data editing and updating arc in progress and expected to be completed by March,

1988 and tabulation will be done during 1988.

3. Economic Database

The Bank has undertaken to develop a comprehensive database for use by its Economic Research Department. During the current year, the Bank acquired the necessary software, trained staff and made considerable upgrades to the hardware.

4 Introduction of Computing Equipment into User Departments

During 1987, the Central Bank embarked on an accelerated program for com­puterizing many application areas which need computerization. It was decided to instal data processing equipment, particularly personal computers, in user depart­ments. Depending on the requirement, connectivity to the main computer is also provided. Applications with very large volumes of data and transactions will continue to use the mainframe.

MANAGEMENT AUDIT

The Internal Audit Division, in accordance with its programme of work, carried out' the functions of audit of the various Departments of the Bank, in­cluding the Regional Offices at Matale, Matara and Anuradhapura during the year 1987.

As a part of the on-going project on studying the manpower requirements of the Bank, the Management Services Division undertook a study of the manpower require ments of the Bank's Internal Audit Division during the year.

The work of revising the Audit Manuals currently being used by the Bank conti­nued during 1987.
