    "text": "The narrowing of the budget deficit in 1987 was the outcome of several factors. First, despite the slow growth in government revenue from income taxes and general sales and turnover taxes, the overall growth in government revenue was maintained at a high level, on account of higher receipts from international trade oriented taxes and from non-tax revenue sources. Second, advance account operations which had been a major element of budgetary imbalance in recent years, showed a substantial improvement, generating a surplus. Third, the supplementary expenditure required for defence was diverted from other ministries, by imposing a 11 per cent cut in their rupee provisions for capital expenditure. These developments were conducive to producing a fiscal out-turn with a lower budget deficit in 1987.",

    "text": "While the overall budgetary position showed a lower deficit, the behaviour of fiscal magnitudes in 1987 continued to reflect the stresses and limitations under which fiscal system is operating at the moment. For instance, although the current account sur\u00adplus rose marginally in nominal terms, as a proportion of GDP the surplus declined from 1.8 per cent in 1986 to 1.7 per cent in 1987. Meanwhile, the budget deficit, net of re\u00adsources from foreign and domestic nonbank sources, resulted in agap of Rs. 3,541 million, which was financed from banking sources. In relation to GDP, the resources utilized from the banking system in 1987 was 1.8 per cent. The continued reliance on bank borrowings and the narrowing of the current account surplus would suggest the need for further efforts at economising on government expenditure in line with the availability of resources.",

Hence, the format and the data presented in this section differ from those presented in the previous Annual Reports, but comparable with those given in the Medium-term Policy Framework of the government. According to the Manual, government revenue includes all non-repayable receipts and shown net of refunds made during the year while expenditure includes all non repayable payments by the government. Hence, import duty rebate, trading enterprise grpss receipts and payments, interest paid to the Joint Investment Fund are excluded from both revenue and expenditure. Profits of trading enterprises are included in revenue while losses are included in current expenditure. Defence is treated as a current expenditure item. Capital expenditure is shown net of amortization payments. Current account surplus/deficit (-) is shown as the difference between government revenue and current expenditure. In arriving at the budget deficit, the GFS Manual groups grants with revenue to mean that these transactions reduce the deficit rather than finance it. This treatment is consistent with the approach adopted in national accounts and balance of payments with regard to the treat\u00adment of budgetary data. However, due to different analytical approaches, the budget deficit before grants and after grants u e shown separately in this Report. Lending for public purposes less subse\u00adquent repayments to government is defined as lending minus repayments which is a part of the total government expenditure.",

As a percentage of GDP, government revenue improved from 20.8 per cent in 1986 to 21.4 per cent in 1987, while current expenditure rose from 18.9 per cent to 19.7 per cent. However, the current account surplus/GDP ratio dropped from 1.8 per cent in 1986 to 1.7 per cent in 1987. Despite improved performance in revenue, government savings deteriorated in 1987, owing to an increase in interest pay\u00adments on government debt and an increase of defence expenditure during the year. Interest payments as a proportion of GDP rose from 4.9 per cent in 1986 to 5.2 per cent in 1987. while defence related expenditure/GDP ratio incresed from 3.5 per cent to 4.8 per cent.",

In fact, foreign loans, which financed nearly one half of the budget deficit in recent years, accounted only for a third of the deficit in 1987. As a proportion of GDP, foreign loans amounted to 3 per cent in 1987 as compared with 4 - 5 per cent in recent years.

    "text": "Government revenue in 1987 amounted to Rs. 42,155 million. This reflected an increase of 13 per cent over the previous year's revenue of Rs. 37,238 million and was an encouraging development considering the set-back to economic performance experienced during the year. Both revenue/GDP ratio and tax/GDP ratios recorded improvements, reflecting a situation where the rate of growth in government revenue has more than kept pace with the rate of growth of the overall economy. Tax revenue contributed 83 per cent of total revenue in 1987, almost as in the previous year. Total revenue collection from taxes on domestic goods and services contributed 44 per cent of tax revenue in 1987, as compared with 47 per cent in 1986. Meanwhile, contribution from international trade oriented taxes increased from 35 per cent in 1986 to 37 per cent in 1987. The share of export taxes in total tax revenue showed a slight improvement, while the contri\u00adbution from income taxes declined from 15 per cent of the tax revenue in 1986 to 14 per cent in 1987. Central Bank's profits, operating surplus of the Department of Tele\u00adcommunications, interest income and the special levy on the Ceylon Petroleum Cor\u00adporation were the largest sources of non-tax revenue of the Government in 1987. Receipts from these sources accounted for nearly 90 per cent of non-tax revenue in 1987.",

Despite the weaker economic outlook in 1987, revenue from domestic taxes on goods and services showed an improve\u00adment owing mainly to an upward revision in excise taxes and a high level of production in the manufacturing industries. The yield from turnover taxes, which formed two thirds of the tax revenue from domestic goods and services, increased by 5 per cent, against a marginal decline of 1 per cent in the previous year. Turnover taxes on manufacturing activities grew by 12 per cent, while those on imports rose by 2 per cent. However, turnover taxes on non-manufacturing activities remained almost at the last year's level.",

This increase was attributed to the upward revision of duty rates in November 1986.

Revenue from import duties of Rs. 11,059 million registered a growth of 17 per cent largely owing to enhanced imports of sugar and petroleum, on the one hand, and the increased unit values, on the other. Hence, the average rate of import duty increased from 17 per cent in 1986 to 18 per cent in 1987. Export-based taxes which contributed around 15 per cent of the international trade taxes also increased by 18 per cent during 1987. Revenue from the specific duty on tea export declined by 5 per cent, while receipts from the export tax on coconut declined by 36 per cent, mainly owing to the lower volume of exports. However, owing to favourable prices, collection from ad-valorem taxes on tea and rubber showed a substantial improvement.",
