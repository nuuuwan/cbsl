Total national savings, which include net factor income and private remittances from aborad, increased by 9.9 per cent to reach an estimated level of Rs. 33 billion in 1988. However the national savings ratio defined as the ratio of national savings to GDP at market prices, declined from 15.3 per cent in 1987 to 14.8 per cent, in 1988. This decline is attributed to the relatively higher rate of increase in net outflow of investment income during the year, when compared to that of the net inflow of private remittances.",
