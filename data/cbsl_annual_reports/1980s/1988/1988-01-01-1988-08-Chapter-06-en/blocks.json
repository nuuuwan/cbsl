There was also considerable demand pressure on prices. The sharp increase in the money supply, as well as the substantial wage increases granted in several key sectors of the economy, contributed towards maintaining la high effective demand during the greater part of the year. The deterioration of the security situation in the last two months of the year, and the resulting disruption of transport, caused supply shortages and a consequent escalation in the prices of most consumer items during that period. \u2022",

The increase in employment in semi government institutions, although marginal, was a reversal of the declining trend observed in recent years. Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Regional Transport Boards, certain trading corporations, service based establishments and higher educational institutions were among the semi-governmental organizations that registered significant increases in employment in 1988.",

The unfavourable impact of civil disturbances on employment was evident mainly in the productive sectors such as agriculture and industry. The non-expansion of the estate plantation sector has resulted in the gradual decline of the number of estate workers. The alienation of marginal lands was also a factor responsible for this decline. The expansion jn non-traditional export industries such as textile and garments, (as evident in the conti\u00adnuous increase in employment in the GCEC enterprises) continued to be a major source of labour absorption in 1988 as well. This phenomenon reflected a gradual shift of labour away from traditional activities.",
