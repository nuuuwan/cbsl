In food, beverages and tobacco category, a substantial drop in public sector output was compensated by increases in the output of several products in the private sector, such as meat products, flour, confectionery and biscuits. The marginal decrease in the output of paper and paper products was largely due to the lower production level in the National Paper Corporation. Increased production in the petroleum refinery and a number of private sector industries such as chemical products, rubber products, plastic products and pharmaceuticals, resulted in an expansion in the output of the chemicals, petroleum and plastic products category.; In the non-metallic mineral products sector, the improvement was largely due to increased output of private sector industries manufacturing asbestos, glass products and ceramics. The increased output in the basic metal products category came exclusively from a higher level of output in the Steel Corporation. In the fabricated metal products sector, improvement was largely due to the increased output of private sector industries engaged in the manufacture of products such as machinery and equipment, water pumps and bulbs.",
