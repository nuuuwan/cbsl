The provisional estimates show that the agriculture sector, inclusive of forestry and fishing, has grown by 2.1 per cent. In the previous year, value-added in this sector decreased by 6 per cent under the impact of the drought. The improved performance of the agriculture sector in 1988 was the outcome of increased production of a number of commodities such as tea, paddy, sugar cane, minor export crops and minor food crops. Tea production rose by 6.4 per cent, while the overall growth in the paddy sub-sector was 16.4 per cent-the highest on record for any single year in recent times. Substantial increases in the output of minor export crops, minor food crops and sugar cane had also been recorded. On the other hand, coconut production recorded a sharp decrease of 15.7 per cent in 1988, largely due to the lagged effects of drought conditions prevalent in 1986 and early 1987.",

The overall growth in the manufacturing sector in 1988 was estimated at 4.7 per cent. A major part of this growth occurred in factory industry, the output of which is estimated to have expanded by 7 per cent in 1988. Within the factory industries sub sector, the output of private sector industries increased by 10 per cent, while that of the state owned industries declined. Although the performance of the services sector was modest, it made a significant contribution to the overall growth of the economy in view of its relatively heavy weightage. Banking, insurance and real estate, which recorded a 6 per cent growth, was the leading growth sector within the broad services sector. The improvement in the water levels of hydro-reservoirs enabled the electri\u00adcity, gas and sanitary services to post a growth rate of 3.5 per cent. In comparison, the growth performance in a number of other sectors had been fairly modest in 1988. Among these were the construction sector (1.5 per cent), the services sector (2.2 per cent) and the wholesale and retail trade sector (2.7 per cent).",

As in the case of tea, the production increase in rubber too was shared between the public and private sectors,. Reversing the production performance in the previous year, the output of the public sector increased marginally accounting for about 33 per cent of the total production. The rubber production of the JEDBs and SLSPCs increased marginally by 2 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, and their combined production amounted to 39.1 million kgs.

The factories at Pelwatte and Sevana\u00adgala more than doubled their production to 29,972 metric tons and 11,039 metric tons, respectively. The Hingurana factory recorded an increase of 28 per cent in production to 11,084 metric tons. In contrast, sugar production at the Kantale factory suffered a severe setback, recording a 37 per cent decrease, mainly due to the reduced area harvested and the lower average yield resulting from reduced supply of water from the Kantale tank for cane cultivation. Sugar production in the private sector which came entirely from the Pelwatte factory accounted for 56 per cent of the total sugar production in 1988. If not for the labour shortage and breakdown of electricity supply during the fourth quarter following the escalation of civil disturbances, the overall production performance of the sugar sector would have been even more impressive.",

Among the crops which have shown substantially improved performance in 1988 were coffee, cloves, nutmeg and mace. Significant increases in export volumes were also observed in the case of pepper, sesame seeds and cashew nuts, indicating corresponding output increases. Favourable weather conditions experienced in the major producing areas, coupled with enhanced fertilizer application, contributed to the increase in the output of most export crops in 1988. Judging by the decreases in export volumes, the production of three important crops, viz. cinnamon, cocoa and cardamoms, appeared to have declined in 1988. The unsettled conditions in the Southern province during the fourth quarter of 1988 affected cinnamon production.",

Against a decline of 6 per cent in price (in SDR terms) the increase in earnings was solely due to a rise in the export volume by 9 per cent to 220 million kgs. Meanwhile , the value of rubber exports increased by 13 per cent, from SDR 77 million (Rs. 2,929 million), in 1987 to SDR 87 million (Rs. 3,706 million), in 1988, due entirely to a rise in export price by 19 per cent. The volume of rubber exports which had declined by 4 per cent in 1987, dropped a further 6 per cent to 99 million kgs. in 1988. The earnings from coconut exports dropped sharply by 36 per cent, from SDR 56 million (Rs. 2,140 million), in 1987 to SDR 36 million (Rs. 1,538 million) in 1988, owing to a sharp decrease in the export volume caused by lower production. Meanwhile, there was a sharp improvement in the value of minor agricultural exports, which rose by as much as 33 per cent in SDR terms to SDR 60 million (Rs. 2,561 million). In comparison, the value of industrial exports recorded a marginal increase of 1 per cent, from SDR 525 million in 1987 to SDR 53Q.million in 1988. This was in sharp contrast to a 9 per cent growth posted in the previous year.

The increase was reflected mainly in the consumer goods and intermediate goods categories. In sharp contrast to the experience in the previous year, when the outlay on consumer goods imports declined by 3 per cent in SDR terms, such outlays rose by 12 per cent, from SDR 363 million (Rs. 13,814 million) in 1987 to SDR 408 million (Rs. 17,425 million) in 1988. The increase was reflected in all categories of consumer goods imports. The expenditure on rice imports more than doubled, from SDR 18 million (Rs. 687 million) in 1987 to SDR 42 million (Rs. 1,795 million) in 1988. This was the combined outcome of increases in the volume by 86 per cent, to 210,000 metric tons, and in the price by 25 per cent. A sharp rise in the price of sugar by 29 per cent resulted in the value of sugar imports rising by 9 per cent to SDR 69 million (Rs. 2,927 million), despite a 15 per cent decline in the import volume.

The increase was largely the outcome of increases in both the volume and prices of major import categories such as fertilizer, wheat grain and chemicals. The outlay on fertilizer imports increased sharply by 70 per cent to SDR 58 million (Rs. 2,476 million), owing to a substantial rise in quantity, from 373,000 metric tons to 556,000 metric tons, and a 14 per cent increase in price. Again, due to increases in the volume by 6 per cent and the price by 30 per cent, the outlay on wheat grain imports rose by 38 per cent, from SDR 51 million (Rs. 1,923 million) in 1987 to SDR 70 million (Rs. 2,983 million) in 1988. Meanwhile, the expenditure on chemical imports rose from SDR 41 million (Rs. 1,559 million) to SDR 44 million (Rs. 1,887 million).

The deficit in the merchandise account widened by 9 per cent, from SDR 525 million (Rs. 20,005 million) in 1987 to SDR 574 million (Rs. 24,512 million) in 1988. Following the same path, the current account deficit expanded by 22 percent, from SDR 265 million (Rs. 10,093 million) in the previous year to SDR 324 million (Rs. 13,841 million) in 1988. Thus, the current account deficit to GDP ratio increased from 5.1 per cent in 1987 to 6.2 per cent in 1988, reflecting increased pressure on the balance of payments. Meanwhile, the net non-monetary capital inflow for financing the current account deficit, fell by 11 per cent in 1988, thus leaving an enlarged overall deficit of SDR 101 million to be met by drawing on the external assets of the country. This was the fourth consecutive year in which the overall balance was in deficit, and the cumulative deficit during the last 4 years was in the region of SDR 358 million.",

However, after reaching a peak in 1984, such remittances have continued to decline slowly thereafter, in real terms. The gross receipts from private transfers amounted to SDR 262 million in 1988, compared with SDR 270 million in 1987. However, in Rupee terms, these remittances showed an increase of 8 per cent, from Rs. 10,324 million in 1987 to Rs. 11,194 million in 1988. In 1988, official transfers, consisting of project and commodity grants, rose marginally from SDR 139 million (Rs. 5,311 million) to SDR 142 million (Rs. 6,077 million). Thus, the combined transfer receipts from private and official sources, taken together, recorded a marginal decline in SDR terms. In 1988, the net transfer payments were sufficient to meet only 54 per cent of the deficit on goods and services, as compared with 59 per cent in 1987, leaving a larger current account deficit amounting to SDR 324 million (Rs. 13,841 million), to be financed by capital flows. The current account deficit in 1987 was SDR 264 million. Thus after two years of improved performance, the current account balance in 1988 took a turn for the worse.",

First, the unsettled conditions in the country and the sporadic disturbances, resulted in a lower collection of revenue from several sources. Second, the increased commitments on account of personal emoluments, interest payments, food stamps, drought relief and security related outlays led to a substantial expansion in current expenditure. Third, the advance account operations under the food purchase and distribution account resulted in a considerable increase in outlays. Fourth, a large number of supplementary capital expenditure provisions had to be accommodated, as the year progressed.

In comparison, the broad money supply (M 2), defined to include Mj plus time and savings deposits held by the public with commercial banks (quasi money), expanded by Rs. 9,611 million or 16 per cent. The corresponding increase in broad money in 1987 was Rs. 7,475 million or 15 per cent. The lower growth in broad money was due to a slowing down in the growth of time and savings deposits of the public held with commercial banks, which rose by Rs. 2,315 million or 7 per cent in 1988, compared with Rs. 3,571 million or 12 per cent in 1987.",

This unhealthy development was partly due to a disruption of normal banking services in some parts of the country and partly to the public's preference for liquid assets to meet unforeseen emergencies in the context of sporadic outbreaks of violence in the country. Alongside the sharp rise in the currency component of the money supply, there was also a considerable increase in the demand for currency notes of higher denominations viz. Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000. This reflects the increased use of high value notes for transaction purposes against a background of continuing inflationary pressures in the economy.",

In 1988, the growth in quasi money was only Rs. 2,315 million or 7 per cent, compared with an expansion of Rs. 3,571 million or 12 per cent in 1987. The deceleration in the growth of quasi money in 1988 was perhaps a reflection of a loss of attractiveness of bank deposits as an investment outlet in the context of rising inflationary tendencies in the economy. The growth in quasi money came mainly from other private sector constituents (OPSC), i.e. private sector proper, whose time and savings deposits rose by Rs. 2,100 million or 8 per cent. In comparison, time and savings deposits of government corporations recorded only a marginal increase, while those of co-operative institutions registered a decline.",

The decreases in these assets in 1985, 1986 and 1987 were Rs. 691 million or 7 per cent, Rs. 414 million or 4 per cent and Rs. 443 million or 5 per cent, respectively. The larger decline in net external assets of the banking system in 1988 reflects the worsening of the balance of payments position. The overall deficit in the balance of payments in 1988 was SDR 101 million, compared with the deficit of SDR 72 million in 1987 and SDR 73 million in 1986.

The need to resort to bank financing on this scale arose owing to a deterioration in the budgetary situation, which was due to both a short fall in revenue, as well as a considerable increase in expenditure.

It would appear that the level of activities in the capital market was influenced by the \" wait and see \" policy of investors. Although the number of new issues during the year was twice that of the previous year, the value of shares on offer amounted to only Rs. 202 million, as compared with Rs. 206 million worth of shares on offer in the previous year. The 10 new issues comprised, 5 for land and property development (Rs. 105 million), 4 for banks and finance (Rs. 94 million) and only one in the manufacturing category (Rs. 3 million). The total turnover in the secondary share market rose marginally to Rs. 380 million in 1988 from Rs. 336 million in 1987. The general price level in the market, as measured by the Colombo Securities Exchange (CSE) All Share Price Index, recorded a decline of 21 per cent between end 1987 and end 1988. Following a similar trend; the CSE Sensitive Price Index also recorded a decline of 19 per cent.",

The slow down of economic growth to 1.5 per cent in 1987, was also due to a severe and prolonged drought. The weather conditions improved in 1988, but sporadic civil disturbances continued to disrupt economic activity. Despite such setbacks, the economy showed signs of recovery in 1988, demonstrating its underlying strength and the capacity to adapt itself to changing circumstances. However, this small improvement should not be allowed to conceal the persistence of major disequilibrium linked to inadequacy of savings and excessive budget deficits.",

    "text": "Meanwhile , the country continues to face major structural and financial problems, including constraints on economic growth due to insufficient domestic savings and investment and a vulnerable external sector. In fact, the domestic savings rate has tended to stagnate over the last four years at around 12.4 per cent of GDP, because of the poor performance of the external sector, while the annual average rate of investment remained at 23.4 per cent over the same period. Meanwhile, as already mentioned, Sri Lanka was not able to achieve stable economic conditions which are a pre-requisite for sustained economic expansion. If these trends are allowed to continue, they would undermine confidence and jeopardise economic growth. For these reasons, while emphasizing the alleviation of extreme poverty, it is important to consolidate the country's fiscal position for sustaining the growth momentum of the economy, within a framework of an open and competitive economy.",

As a result, the balance of payments position deteriorated and inflationary pressures further intensified. The burgeoning fiscal deficit is posing major challenges for economic management. Although the monetary policy was considerably tightened, it had only limited success in siphoning-off excess liquidity in the economy, suggesting its- limited usefulness in coping with fiscal excesses. Therefore, restoration of a better balance between government revenue and expenditure is essential for bringing about the desired improvement in fiscal position, which is a vital pre-requisite for enhancing prospects for future growth and stability.",

    "text": "Once the country gets used to large fiscal deficits, it becomes difficult to contain such deficits, falling further into a state of continuous instability, which harms long-term development. When such deficits have to be largely financed from expansionary sources, it will be the poorest members of society who would bear the greatest burden. The answer to growing fiscal deficits usually involves both raising revenue and cutting expenditure, while trying to minimise the social and economic costs of both. The 1988 fiscal developments point to a need for concerted action on two fronts to improve fiscal performance. The first is the need for consolidating the revenue raising effort, which has tended to slide in recent years. The government revenue as a ratio of GDP, which was 22.3 per cent in 1985, had declined to 18.9 per cent in 1988. In a similar development, the ratio of tax revenue to GDP had dropped from 19.5 per cent in 1984 to 16.0 per cent in 1988. The decreases in these ratios suggest a considerable erosion in the revenue collection effort of the government, which needs to be arrested if fiscal performance is to be improved. Second, there had been a notable change in the composition of expenditure in favour of consumption. For instance, while interest payments have been one of the fast growing components of government spending in recent years, capital expenditure appears to have been a category most prone to cutbacks. Consequently, while the total government expenditure as a ratio of GDP has increased the capital expenditure as a ratio of GDP has decreased from 13.3 per cent in 1985 to 9.5 per cent in 1988\u2014a development which is not conducive to maintaining the tempo of future development. Therefore, the need of the hour is to raise more revenue through better tax effort and to divert a greater share of that revenue for investment, which would form the basis for future growth and employment creation.",

    "text": "A compression of the present scale of budget deficits is also essential for bringing about an improvement in the balance of payments, since large fiscal deficits tend to spill over and contribute to high current account deficits in the balance of payments, with accompanying implications on external reserves and the exchange rate. An improvement in the current account of the balance of payments requires a commensurate reduction in the overall savings\u2014investments gap. Since the widening of the latter is largely attributable to a deterioration in budgetary savings, reduction in the fiscal imbalance will contribute substantially towards a sustained improvement in the balance of payments.",
