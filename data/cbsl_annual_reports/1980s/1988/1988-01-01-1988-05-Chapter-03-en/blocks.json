The area replanted on the estates managed by the JEDBs increased by 19 per cent to 948 hectares, while those of the SLSPCs.dropped by 8 per cent to 1,128 hectares in 1988. Replanting in the private sector estates, including smallholdings, declined considerably by, 42 per cent to 2,091 hectares. The overall decrease in extent replanted is partly explained by relatively attractive prices that prevailed, particularly in the first half of the year, which prompted most of the smallholders to postpone their replanting programmes. During the year, 1,63.0 hectares were replanted under the World Bank Assisted Rubber Rehabilitation Project in major rubber growing districts,-bringing the cumulative extent replanted under this project 4t the end of 1988 to 21,669 hectares.",

The main contributory factors for the price improvement were the strong demand, particularly from the medical products industry and the low domestic as well as global rubber supplies.

However, it was not possible to reap maximum advantage of higher international prices, as the availability of nuts for processing was very low.

The average cost of production of coconut, in 1988, estimated at Rs. 1.21 per nut, was 22 per cent higher than Re. 0.99 per nut estimated for 1987, mainly due to increased wages and input prices.

Export volume of cloves recorded a more than four-fold increase, while that of nutmeg and mace reported a significant increase. Substantial increases in the export volumes of pepper (34 per cent), sesame seeds (33 per cent) and cashew nuts (8 per cent), indicate that the output of these crops too had increased considerably in 1988. Favourable weather conditions experienced in the major producing areas, coupled with increased fertilizer application, contributed to the increase in output of most of the crops in 1988. The upturn in the production cycle and lagged impact of increased planting activities in the recent past also may have had a favourable influence on production. However, judging by the decreases in export volumes, the production of three important crops, namely cinnamon, cocoa and cardamoms, appears to have declined during 1988. Unsettled conditions in the Southern province towards the end of 1988 adversely affected cinnamon production.",

Higher production in major paddy producing areas in both Maha and Yala seasons was a major contributory factor for this increase. Paddy purchases from the Anuradhapura district reported a more than three-fold increase, while the Polonnaruwa district recorded an increase of 43 per cent over the purchases made in the previous year. As in previous years, the bulk of the purchases of the PMB was from the Maha harvest, accounting for about 97 per cent of the total purchases made during the year. However, the PMB was unable to carry out its normal purchasing activities in certain districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces, due to the continued unsettled conditions. The guaranteed price of paddy was raised upwards from Rs. 70 to Rs. 80 per bushel in August, 1988 to provide a higher return to paddy farmers and cushion the adverse impact of the increase in fertilizer price. Despite this upward revision of the guaranteed price, open market prices of paddy continued to remain well above the guaranteed price. In 1988, the average open market price of paddy was Rs. 93.54 per bushel, showing a 5 per cent increase over that of 1987.",

The Hingurana factory reported an increase of 28 per cent in production to 11,084 metric tons. The sharp increase in production of these factories was owing to increased supply of cane for processing which, in turn, was attributed to relatively favourable weather conditions. In contrast, sugar production at the Kantale factory experienced a severe setback, recording a 37 per cent decrease, mainly due to reduced area harvested and the lower average yield resulting from the reduced supply of water from the Kantale tank for cane cultivation. The Moneragala Sugar Company commenced cultivation of sugar cane during the year.",

During the year under review, loans granted by the People's Bank amounted to Rs. 141.7 million (44 per cent of the total) representing a decline of 12 per cent when compared with the record of lending of the previous year. Although the relative shares in the total loans of the Hatton National Bank and the RRDBs are small, their performance during the current year has improved relative to that of the two major banks. The total loans granted by the Hatton National Bank increased by 8.6 per cent in the cultivation year 1988. The value of loans granted by the RRDBs increased 2.4 times from Rs. 5.7 million to Rs. 13.5 million during the same period.",
