GOVERNMENT FINANCE*

According to provisional data, the Budget for 1988 revealed, a current account

deficit of Rs. 6,031 million (2.7 per cent of G D P ) , in sharp contrast to the originally

anticipated surplus of Rs, 5,677 million (or. 2.5 per cent of GDP). Meanwhile, the

overall budgetary operations during the year resulted in a deficit, (before grants)

of Rs. 33,854 million (or 15 percent of G D P ) , as against Rs. 26,309 million (11.6 per

cent of G D P ) targetted in the approved budget estimates. Consequently, the resource

utilization from expansionary sources for financing the deficit increased to Rs. 9,078

million (4.1 per cent of G D P ) from an originally budgeted amount of Rs. 2,576

million (1,1 per cent of G D P ) . Hence, fiscal performance during 1988 showed a

considerable deviation from the original estimates for the year. ,

Fiscal performance in 1988 also showed a considerable deterioration compared

to the performance in the previous year. The current account, which generated a

surplus of Rs. 2,585 million (1.3 per cent of G D P ) in 1987, produced a deficit of Rs.

6,031 million (2.7 per cent of G D P ) in 1988. A budget deficit (before grants) of

Rs. 21,749 million (11 per cent of G D P ) in 1987, rose-tb R s . 3 3 , 8 5 4 million (15 per

cent of G D P ) in 1988. Fiscal operations in 1988 also showed a heavy reliance on

bank borrowings to finance the deficit. The financing from banking source's amoun­

ted to Rs. 9,078 million (4.1 per cent of G D P ) in 1988, as compared with Rs. 3,541

million (1.8 per cent of G D P ) in 1987. ' •

The deterioration in fiscal out-turn in 1988 was the outcome of. several factors.

First, the slow economic growth and unsettled conditions in the country resulted in a

lower collection from a number of. revenue sources, such as turnover taxes o n manu­

facturing activities and excise duties on tobacco and income taxes. Second, the

increased commitments on account of personal emoluments, interest payments,

food stamps, drought relief and security related outlays led to a substantial expansion

in current expenditure of the government. Third, the advance account operations

under food purchase and distribution account resulted in a substantial increase in

government outlays. Fourth, despite a high proportion of under expenditure on

account of rehabilitation and reconstruction works, a large number of supplementary

capital expenditure provisions for on-going projects was permitted without due regard

to the resource constraint.

The combined effect of these developments was the expansion in the budget deficit

from 11 per cent of G D P in 1987 to 15 per cent of G D P i n 1988, necessitating the use

of a large volume of resources from the banking system to bridge the resource gap.

Fiscal Outturn

According to provisional data, government revenue in 1988 amounted to Rs. 42,149

million, while current expenditure totalled Rs. 48,180 million. Accordingly, the

current account of the Budget recorded a larger deficit of Rs. 6,031 million in 1988,

in contrast to a surplus of Rs. 2,585 million in the previous year. In relation to G D P ,

government revenue dropped substantially from 21.4 per cent in 1987 to 18.9 per

cent in 1988, while current expenditure rose from 20.1 per cent to 21.6 per cent.

Thus, the deterioration in the current account balance in 1988 was the combined

outeome of both a revenue shortfall and an expenditure escalation. Reflecting the poor revenue performance, the tax/GDP ratio declined from 17.9 per cent in 1987 to 16 per cent in 1988, while the non-tax revenue/GDP ratio fell from 3.6 per cent to 2.9 per cent. Meanwhile, the current expenditure on salaries and wages, as a proportion of GDP, increased, from 4.1 per cent in 1987 to 4.5 per cent in 1988, while interest payments rose from 5.2 to 5.7 per cent. The transfer payments in relation to GDP alsd grew from 5.6 per cent in 1987 to 6.1 per cent in 1988.

total revenue and grants at Rs. 47,877 million registered a marginal growth of 2 per cent, owing to enhanced foreign aid disbursements during 1988. The total sum of R.s. 5,728 million utilized for budgetary purposes from external grants in 1988 was 22 per cent higher than that in 1987. However, as a proportion of GDP, foreign grants used for budgetary purposes was 2.1 per cent as compared to 2.4 in 1987.

On the other hand, the capital expenditure at Rs. 21,212 million registered a decline of 7 per cent in 1988. Hence, the capital expenditure/GDP ratio, which fell from 13 per cent in 1986 to 11.6 per cent in 1987, declined further to 9.5 per cent in 1988. The decline was largely due to the inability in implementing rehabilitation programmes earmarked for the North and East resulting from unsettled conditions in these regions.

The total expenditure, inclusive of lending minus repayments, at Rs. 76,003 million showed an increase of 19 per cent Accordingly, the ratio of expenditure to GDP rose from 32.5 per cent in 1987 to 34.1 per cent in 1988. The drop in the capital expenditure against a substantial rise in the total expenditure reflects a considerable expansion in consumption'related expenditure by the Government.

The revenue and expenditure flows revealed a deficit (before grants) of Rs. 33,854 million, which exceeded,the previous year's deficit by Rs. 12,105 million. Although the- use of foreign grants for budgetary purposes was stable: in relation to GDP, the budget deficit (after grants) at Rs. 28,126 million showed a considerable increase of 65 per cent in 1988. Accordingly, the deficit (after grants) as a ratio of GDP rose from 8.7 per cent in 1987 to 12.6 per cent in 1988.

A sum of Rs. 7,029 million was utilized from foreign sources, largely through concessional project loans. The utilization of foreign loans for budgetary purpose during 1988 showed an increase of 23 per cent over the amount utilized in the previous year. This, in relation to GDP, grew from 2.9 per cent in 1987 to 3.2 per cent in 1988.

Although resource utilization from foreign sources increased during the year a heavy reliance was placed on domestic resources for financing the deficit. The domestic non-bank sector contributed Rs. 9,316 million for deficit financing as against Rs. 6,400 million in 1987, and as a ratio of GDP the contribution of this sector rose from 3.3 per cent in 1987 to 4.2 per cent in 1988. Meanwhile,: non market sources, including Treasury deposit account operations, provided Rs. 2,703 million. The largest contribution, however, came from the banking system, which contributed Rs.' 9,078 million towards, bridging the resource gap in the budget in 1988. This magnitude of bank borrowings was the largest amount utilized for deficit financing purposes in recent years. - : • *. ~ \

Revenue

Government revenue in: 1988 amounted to Rs. 42,149 million, almost the same amount as in the previous year. Tax revenue at Rs. 35,691 million reflected a margi­nal growth of 2 per cent and accounted for 85 per cent of the total revenue in 1988, in comparison to 83 per cent contributed in the previous year. Taxes on domestic goods and services formed .48 per cent of the tax revenue, as compared to 45 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile, the contribution of the international trade oriented taxes dropped from 37 per cent of the tax revenue in 1987 to 35 per cent in 1988. The share of income taxes in the total tax revenue declined marginally from 14 per cent in 1987 to 13 per cent in 1988, whereas the Tevenue from taxes on property ^transactions remained at 4 per cent, as in the previous year. Central Bank profits transfer, operating surplus of the Department of Telecommunications and interest income continued to be the largest sources of non-tax revenue in 1988. These three sources together contributed nearly 69 per cent of the non-tax revenue in 1988, as compared to 62 per cent in 1987.

Receipts from domestic taxes on goods and services totalling Rs. 17,063 million in 1988, showed an increase of 9 per cent, as compared to 6 per cent growth in the previous year. Despite the unsettled conditions in the country, revenue from domes­tic taxes on goods and services showed some improvement, owing to higher prices and upward revisions in excise duties and turnover tax rates on selected items. The revenue collection from turnover taxes, which accounted for nearly three-fourths of the total tax revenue from domestic goods and services, rose by 16 per cent, in com­parison to a 5 per cent increase in the previous year. Despite an 11 per cent growth in the value of output in manufacturing activities, turnover tax collection from these activities declined by 2 per cent, as compared to a 12 per cent increase in the previous year. The decline in revenue collection from these activities was a result of the ex-tention granted to these manufacturers as their liquidity position was affected by disruption. Reflecting a satisfactory performance in the services sector, particularly services such as banking and finance, the turnover tax collection from non manufac­turing activities grew by 39 per cent in 1988. The yield from turnover taxes, on im­ports showed an expansion of 18 per cent, owing to a substantial increase in the value of imports during the year.

'Revenue from excise taxes at Rs. 4,443 million accounted for about a fourth of tax revenue from domestic goods and services in 1988. Despite the upward revisions in excise duties on tobacco, the revenue collection from this source registered a decline of 15 per cent due to the shortfall in the volume of sales resulting from both labour disputes and unsettled conditions in the country. However, revenue collec­tion from excise duty on liquor at Rs. 1,839 million recorded an increase of 12 per cent, as compared to an 11 per cent rise in the previous year. The increase was entirely due to the upward, revisions in duty rates effected during the year.

Revenue raised through international trade oriented taxes during 1988 amounted to Rs. 12,442 million. This was a decline of 4 per cent, in comparison to an increase of 17 per cent in the previous year. Despite an increase in the volume of imports in 1988, revenue from import duties in 1988 at Rs. 10,610 million showed a decline of

4 per cent, owing to the downward revisions in duties on selected items such as motor cycles and motor scooters, liquor, tobacco, cement, etc. and exemption of some Essential consumer items such as wheat grain, milk powder, dhal, etc. from import . duties. Accordingly, the average import duty rate declined from 18 per cent in 1987 ' to 15 per cent in 1988. Taxes based on exports yielded Rs. 1,832 million and reflected a decline of 5 per cent over the amount collected in the previous year. Revenue from the specific duty pn tea exports declined by 32 per cent, owing to a reduction in duty rates, while the collection from export duties on rubber improved by .59 per cent owing to favourable prices. Meanwhile, revenue from export duty on coconut recorded a substantial decline of 55 per cent, primarily owing to a decline in the volume of exports.during the year.

Revenue from income taxes of both corporate and personal tax payers at Rs. 4,746 million registered a decline of 3 per cent over the previous year's revenue of Rs. 4,909 million. The decline in the income tax receipts in 1988 was largely due to the collec­tion delays resulting from unsettled conditions that prevailed in the country especially during the last quarter of the year.

- A'statistical summary of government revenue is given in Table 1.42.

Current Expenditure

Total current expenditure in' 1988 amounted to Rs. 48,180 million. This was an. increase of 22 per cent over the previous year's current expenditure of Rs. 39,560 million, As in the previous year, the current expenditure accounted for about three-fifths of the total expenditure in 1988. The expenditure on goods and services amoun-ting-to Rs. 21,916 million formed 45 per cent of the current expenditure, while transfer payments to,households, corporations and other levels of government institutions totalling Rs. 13,519 million accounted for 28 per cent. The total interest payments on government debt amounted to Rs. 12,745 million and formed about 26 per cent of the current expenditure in 1988.

Of the total expenditure on goods and services, Rs. 10,086 million was on account of salaries and wages of government employees. Expenditure on salaries and wages which accounted for 21 per cent of the total current expenditure in 1988 showed a growth of 26 per cent, largely owing to the salary increases effected in 1988. The outlays on other goods and services at Rs. 11,830 million registered a growth of 13 per cent, primarily owing to increased outlays on security related activities.

The transfer payments totalling Rs. 13,519 million in 1988 showed an increase of 24 per cent, as compared with a 9 per cent rise in the previous year. Pension payments at Rs. 4,057 niillfon increased by 25 per cent. The current transfers on account of fobd arid'kerosene stamps and drought relief amounted to Rs. 4,223 million, as

compared with Rs. 2,925 million in the previous year. The increase was largely due to the additional assistance provided to the people in drought affected areas through drought relief and enhanced food stamp benefits. Meanwhile, current transfers made to public enterprises in 1988 was Rs. 2,425 million. This showed an increase of about 41 per cent, owing to higher operational losses, particularly in utility services such as the Railways and the Postal Department, resulting from wage increases and disruptions to these services. -

Interest payments on government debt in 1988 amounted to Rs. 12,745 million, as compared with Rs. 10,157 million in 1987. The. interest payments on domestic debt at Rs. 9,440 million recorded an increase of 24 per cent, while those on foreign debt at Rs. 3,305 million registered a growth of 29 per cent. Interest payments on rupee loans, at Rs. 5,257 million, registered an increase of 6 per cent and accounted for 56 per cent of total interest payments on domestic debt. Meanwhile, interest payments on Treasury bills amounting to Rs. 4,198 million reflected an increase of 36 per cent, owing to both an: enhanced volume of borrowings through Treasury bills and a rise in the Treasury bill fate, especially during the last quarterof the year.

Capital Expenditure

Capital expenditure amounted to Rs. 21,212 million, "as compared to Rs.> 27,017 million provided in the approved budget estimates for 1988. In comparison to the previous year, capital expenditure in 1988 showed a decline of 7 per cent. Accor­dingly, government capital formation as a proportion of GDP declined from 11.6 per cent in 1987 to 9.5 per cent in 1988. The decline\i.n capital expenditure during 1988 was largely due to the under expenditure on account of rehabilitation and reconstruction work resulting from unsettled security conditions. \

Capital projects directly sponsored by government departments and ministries absorbed a sum of Rs. 7,503 million, or 35 per cent of the total capital expenditure incurred in 1988. The major investment activities undertaken by.these agencies comprised land development, major irrigation rehabilitation projects, development of the telecommunication net work and the construction of buildings for general and teacher education.

The capital investment undertaken by public enterprises amounted to Rs. 13,203 million or about 62 per cent of the total capital expenditure in 1988 Of this, nearly 70 per cent of the investment'was undertaken by-four agencies namely, Mahaweli Development Authority (Rs. 5,050 million), Airports and Aviation Ltd. (Rs. 1,943 million), Water Supply and Drainage Board (Rs. 1,056 million) and the Road Development Authority (Rs. 895 million). The investments by these agencies were entirely on on-going infrastructural development activities.

TRENDS IN FISCAL MAGNITUDES

( 125 )

Lending Minus Repayments

The lending minus repayments during the year amounted to Rs. 6,611 million, as compared with Rs. 1,518 million in 1987. Of this, a sum of Rs. 1,750 million was on account of advance account operations, which resulted in net outpayments arising from the Food Commissioner's operations. A sum of Rs. 5,324 million was provided to a number of corporations in the form of loans. Of this, Rs. 3,901 million was to the Ceylon Electricity Board for the continuing development activities of Samanalawewa and the Rantembe Power Projects and several transmission and distribution projects. Other noteworthy borrowers were the State Plantations Corporation (Rs. 373.2 million) and the Janatha Estate Development Board (Rs. 463.2 million).

A statistical summary of government expenditure and lending minus repayments is given in table 1.43.

Financing of the Budget Deficit

The budget deficit (after grants) in 1988 amounted to Rs. 28,126 million, as against an orginally targetted deficit of Rs. 21,309 million. The deficit in the previous year was Rs. 17,072 million. The total resources available from foreign sources and domestic non-bank sources was Rs. 19,048 million, thus leaving a resource gap of Rs. 9,078 million in 1988, which had to be financed from banking sources.

The net foreign borrowings at Rs. 7,029 million, registering an increase of 23 per cent, accounted for a fourth of resources utilized for deficit financing in 1988. Although the original budget estimates anticipated to utilize a sum of f.:>, 12,520 million by foreign borrowings or approximately 60 per cent of the approved budget deficit, the actual utilization was much lower owing to a substantial level of under expenditure on account of rehabilitation and reconstruction work programmed for the year.

The non market borrowings amounted to Rs. 2,703 million. This was mobilized through Treasury deposit account operations. Although it has been recognised that the creation of liabilities through Treasury deposit accounts was an unhealthy feature of fiscal management, the 1988 fiscal operations showed an enhanced use of these accounts.

Market borrowings in 1988 at Rs. 18,394 million was an increase of 85 per cent over the amount borrowed in the previous year. This comprised Rs. 9,316 million from non-bank sources and Rs. 9,078 million from bank' sources. Rupee securities to a large extent and Treasury bills to an appreciable degree were instrumental in mobilizing resources from non bank sources. The resources mobilized through rupee securities amounted to Rs. 4,840 million, while sinking fund transfers provided a further sum of Rs. 1,239 million. Resources mobilized from non-bank sources through Treasury bills totalled Rs. 2,601 million, as against Rs.282 million obtained in the previous year. The traditional captive sources, viz. the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and the National Savings Bank (NSB) continued to be the principal subscribers to rupee securities in 1988.

The gross resources mobilized from the banking system in 1988 totalled Rs. 11,289 million. However, on account of a repayment of Rs. 251 million to the banking system and a build-up of deposits amounting to Rs. 1,960 million during the year, the

( 126 )

net borrowings from the banking system were Rs. 9,078 million. Of this, a sum of Rs. 926 million was through Central Bank's provisional advances. The transactions under Central Bank provisional advances in the previous year resulted in a net repay­ment of Rs. 40 million. The large bulk of the borrowings from the Central Bank during the year was through the issue of Treasury bills. The gross amount so borrow­ed was Rs. 9,357 million.

Government Debt

The outstanding government debt at the end of 1988 stood at Rs. 223,002 million. This was an increase of Rs. 32,193 million, or 17 per cent over the outstanding amount of Rs. 190,809 million, a year ago. The outstanding domestic debt increased by 25 per cent to Rs. 98,594 million, while the foreign debt rose by 11 per cent to Rs. 124,408 million. Medium and long term debt accounted for 51 per cent of the outstanding domestic debt in 1988, as compared to 57 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile, long-term concessional loans formed 92 per cent of foreign debt in 1988, as compared to 90 per cent in 1987. The composition of government debt by type of debt holder and by type of debt instrument are given in tables 1.44 and 1.45.

The outstanding liability on account of domestic debt at Rs. 98,594 million accoun­ted for 44 per cent of the total debt at the end of 1988. In the previous year, domestic debt formed 42 per cent of the total government debt. The non-bank sector's holding of the outstanding debt amounting to Rs. 56,085 million, registered an increase of 16 per cent in 1988, as compared to a growth of 15 per cent in 1987. Mean­while, the banking sector's holding of outstanding domestic debt at Rs. 42,347 million at the end of the year, reflected an expansion of 39 per cent, as compared to a 12 per cent increase in the previous year. The outstanding debt held by the banking sector as a ratio of the total outstanding domestic debt rose from 39 per cent in 1987 to 43 per cent in 1988. Medium and long term (maturity of more than one year) domestic debt at the end of the year totalled Rs. 49,959 million, while the short term (maturity of less than a year) debt amounted to Rs. 48,635 million. Accordingly, outstanding medium and long term domestic debt grew by 11 per cent, while the short term debt increased by 44 per cent. Hence, the share of short term debt in the total domestic debt rose from 43 per cent in 1987 to 49 per cent in 1988, the result of heavy borrowings through Treasury bills during the year. Accordingly, authorised limit of Treasury bills outstanding had to be raised on several occasions. It was raised from Rs. 35,000 million to Rs. 40,000 million as from 21st August, 1988, then to Rs. 45,000 million on 25th October, and subsequently to Rs. 55,000 million as from 7th December, 1988.

Rupee securities formed almost the entire medium and long term domestic debt. The outstanding liabilities on account of rupee securities at the end of the year of Rs. 49,797 million registered a growth of 11 per cent, as compared with a 15 per cent expansion in the previous year. During the year under review, a total sum of Rs. 10,000 million was raised through rupee securities, as against Rs. 7,000 million in 1987. However, the outstanding liability on account of rupee loans rose by only Rs. 4,840 million, as repayments of rupee loans during the year amounted to Rs. 5,160 million.

The Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) investing Rs. 6,163 million in rupee secu­rities, continued to be the largest single subscriber to the rupee loan programme. The investment made by the EPF in rupee loans during 1988 registered an increase of 46 per cent, as against a decline of 17 per cent in the previous year.
