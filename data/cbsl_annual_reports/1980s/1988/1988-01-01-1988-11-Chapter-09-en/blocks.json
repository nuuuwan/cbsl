Despite the unsettled conditions in the country, revenue from domes\u00adtic taxes on goods and services showed some improvement, owing to higher prices and upward revisions in excise duties and turnover tax rates on selected items. The revenue collection from turnover taxes, which accounted for nearly three-fourths of the total tax revenue from domestic goods and services, rose by 16 per cent, in com\u00adparison to a 5 per cent increase in the previous year. Despite an 11 per cent growth in the value of output in manufacturing activities, turnover tax collection from these activities declined by 2 per cent, as compared to a 12 per cent increase in the previous year. The decline in revenue collection from these activities was a result of the ex-tention granted to these manufacturers as their liquidity position was affected by disruption. Reflecting a satisfactory performance in the services sector, particularly services such as banking and finance, the turnover tax collection from non manufac\u00adturing activities grew by 39 per cent in 1988. The yield from turnover taxes, on im\u00adports showed an expansion of 18 per cent, owing to a substantial increase in the value of imports during the year.",
