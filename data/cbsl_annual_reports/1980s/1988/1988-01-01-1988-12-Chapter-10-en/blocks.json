    "text": "A considerable acceleration in the rate of growth of money sxpply, mainly resulting from a substantial expansion in domestic credit, was the salient feature of monetary developments in 1988. The annual rate of growth of narrow money supply (M,), consisting of currency and demand deposits held by the public, which stood at 18 per cent as at the end of 1987, increased to 29 per cent by the end of 1988. In absolute terms, the narrow money supply rose substantially by Rs. 7,296 million in 1988, ; compared with an increase of Rs. 3,904 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, the time and savings deposits of the public held with commercial banks (quasi-money) increased at a slower rate of 7 per cent in 1988, compared with a 12 per cent growth in 1987. Consequently, the broad money supply (MJ, defined to include M, plus quasi-money, grew by Rs. 9,611 million or 16 per cent in 1988, compared with a growth of Rs. 7,475 million or 15 per cent in the preceding year.",

The corres\u00adponding increase in 1987 was Rs, 1,925 million or 17 per cent. Consequently, the share of the currency component in M, rose from 54 per cent in 1987 to 57 per cent in 1988, largely reflecting the public's preference for liquid assets to meet unforeseen emergencies arising from the sporadic civil disturbances in the country. At the same time, the public's demand for currency notes of higher denominations of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500, continued to remain high, reflecting the increased use of high value notes for transaction purposes against a background of continuing inflationary pressures. Accordingly, the share of these notes in the total currency issue rose from 61 per cent at end of 1987 to 66 per cent by the end of 1988.",

In comparison, time and savings deposits of government corporations recorded a marginal increase of Rs. 242 million or 5 per cent.

This was a worrisome development from the view-point of sound monetary management and containing inflationary pressures. The need to borrow from the banking system was more marked during the closing months of 1988, arising from a sharply deteriorating fiscal situation. Upto the end of October, Government's borrowings from the banking system increased at a slow pace, with some marginal fluctuations, but recorded a sharp growth during the last two months of the year. Puring the first ten months of 1988, the NCG rose by Rs. 3,758 million or by a month\u00adly average of Rs. 376 million. However, during the last two months of 1988, the NCG increased sharply by Rs. 5,259 million, thereby exerting considerable pressure on \"the monetary aggregates.",

Meanwhile; commercial bank credit to government corporations expanded by Rs. 3,421 million or 46 per cent in 1988, compared with an increase of Rs. 2,627 million or; 55 per cent in the previous year. The sharp rise in credit to this sector reflected increased working capital requirements of certain key corporations owing to unsettled conditions, on the one hand, and rising costs, especially the enhanced wage bills, on the other. Credit to co-operative institutions increased by Rs. 195 million or 17, per cent during 1988, in contrast to a decline of Rs. 301 million or)21 per cent in 1987.

This scheme was aimed at easing the burden on borrowers by adopting only a minimum amount of documentation and charging comparatively lower rates of interest than those prevailing in informal money markets. Under the scheme, the two state banks are expected to appoint agents and grant loans for on-lending to prospective small borrowers. However, the agents are not expected to mobilise deposits on behalf of the banks. The loans are granted by banks to the agents at an annual rate of 18 per cent. The agent would, in turn, re-lend-these monies at a rate of interest of 30 per cent per annum. The maximum size of a loan to a borrower will be Rs. 5,000 with a maximum maturity of one year. Repayments can be made daily, weekly, monthly or half yearly.",

For instance, under the small and medium industries (SMI) Project III, which came into effect in mid 1988, a variable refinance rate was introduced. The arrangement was to arrive at the refinance rate to be effective in a 6 month period, by subtracting 6 percentage points from the average weighted prime lending rate of commercial banks (AWPR) during the preceding 6 months. However, the on-lending rate was not specified, thereby giving the lending institutions the freedom to decide their own margins, based on operational costs and project risk. In the case of direct lending for projects, fixed and variable rates which were''linked to the (AWPR) were introduced. The borrowers were given the option of selecting a variable or a fixed interest rate. Meanwhile, the lending rates applicable to equipment financing, loans for construction of commercial buildings and working capital and bridging finance were increased from 1st January, 1988. Accordingly; the lending rates in respect of'these categories rose from a level of 14 per cent per annum at the end of 1987 to a range between 15 and 18 percent per annum in 1988. The State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB) and the National Savings Bank (NSB) made marginal upward revisions in their lending rates for housing purposes.

First, a few finance companies in distress had to be assisted with refinance, in order to maintain their viability and to revive confidence. This refinance facility was made available through commercial banks at a 12 per cent annual interest rate and a maturity period of maximum 7 years. Also credit institutions were permitted to keep a margin not exceeding 3 per cent per annum. The outstanding amount of refinance granted under this scheme was Rs. 82 million at the end of 1988. Further, two relief measures were introduced late in the year in view of the problems faced by industrialists and exporters, due to the intensification of civil disturbances during the last quarter of 1988. First, in view of the liquidity problems faced by commercial banks due to these disturbances, the Central Bank in terms of Section 83(l)(c) of the Monetary Law Act, granted temporary accommodation to affected banks. This took the form of advances to such banks at a special interest rate of 15 per cent per annum. In order to ensure that the measure was in keeping with the overall policy stance of restraining monetary expansion, it was restricted to banks that were net borrowers in the inter-bank call money market and those which did not have a port\u00adfolio of Treasury bills in excess of what was required to fund the bank's reserve require\u00adment. Second, an additional temporary facility was granted to exporters adversely affected by the civil disturbances during the last quarter. Under this facility, which was to be obtained through commercial banks, the period of refinance granted by the Central Bank to commercial banks on account of pre-shipment advances to ex\u00adporters, was to be extended from the usual period of 3 months to 5 months. This facility was restricted to those exporters unable to fulfil their export contracts owing to work disruptions. Both measures were short-term measures and were expected to lapse at the end of January, 1989.",
