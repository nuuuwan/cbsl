The rate of growth of industrial exports decelerated in 1988, primarily due to a fall in the earnings from garments and petroleum exports. Textiles and garments exports declined by 2 per cent, from SDR 339 million to SDR 333 million, and petroleum exports by 22 per cent, from SDR 68 million to SDR 53 million, between the two years. While the decline in the volume of garment exports was mainly due to the escalation in civil disturbances which affected the normal working of factories, the decline in the value of petroleum export was a result of a sharp drop in prices, from SDR 106 per metric ton in 1987 to SDR. 77 per metric ton in 1988. However, the value of other industrial products increased by 21 per cent, reflecting increased earnings from processed diamonds, leather and rubber products, marine products and chemical products.
