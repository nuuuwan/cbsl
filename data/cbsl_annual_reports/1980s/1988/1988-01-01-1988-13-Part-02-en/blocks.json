Thereafter, the administration and management of the four suspended companies were vested with the Monetary Board.

Later, the restrictions imposed on one finance company were withdrawn and approval was granted for it to carry-on normal operations. Under the new regulations, the Monetary Board was empowered to take over the administration and management of any finance company, enter into an agreement with a management company to administer the affairs of a company vested with the Monetary Board, remove any Director from the Board of Directors of a finance company and if deemed necessary appoint auditors to audit the books and accounts of a finance company.",

In contrast, all self-employment schemes recorded favourable trends due to the wide range of activities for which loans could be granted. Despite slow progress made in some schemes, the All Island Farm Machinery Loan Scheme and Credit Schemes for Dairy and Livestock Development and Sugarcane Cultivation recorded a large drawdown on refinance allocations. The Credit Scheme for Out-growers for cultivation of sugarcane under the Pelwatte Sugar Project, however, recor\u00added low disbursement because, unlike a similar scheme targetted to permanent settlers under the project, Outgrowers were not engaged full-time in sugarcane cultivation and, therefore, the banks were reluctant to provide credit for sugarcane cultivation.",

The total amount of deposits mobilized by all RRDBs nearly doubled from Rs. 53 million on 87,978 accounts as at the end of 1987 to Rs. 103 million on 144,516 accounts as at the end of 1988. Approximately 87 per cent of the total deposits was accounted for by the ordinary savings accounts and the share of fixed deposits in total deposits was only about 13 per cent. This indicates that the RRDBs were servicing mainly the relatively poor in rural areas. The figures show that the average value of deposits per account has risen from Rs. 602 in 1987 to Rs. 716 in 1988, with both savings and fixed deposits taken together. Detailed data on deposit mobilization; are presented in Table 2.8.",

    "text": "The year 1988 also witnessed a considerable expansion in loan operations. The number of loans disbursed increased by 24 per cent from 13,801 during 1987 to 17,127 during 1988. The amount of loans disbursed rose from Rs. 96 million during 1987 to Rs. 109 million during 1988, showing a decline in the average size of loan from Rs. 6,966 in 1987 to Rs. 6,348 in 1988. This decline in the average loan size could be considered a reflection of the greater preference of RRDBs for relatively small loans demanded mainly by the poor. Selected details on loans disbursed by each RRDB are given in Table 2.9. The purpose-wise distribution of loans in 1988 shows that the RRDBs have assigned a high priority to agriculture. As shown in Table 2.10, approximately 44 per cent of the total quantum of loans was for agricultural purposes. The total quantum of loans disbursed to agriculture increased markedly by 36 per cent, from Rs. 35 million in 1987 to Rs. 47 million in 1988. The fact that 18 per cent each of the total quantum of loans was for small industries and for trade and business purposes clearly show that these banks have made a concerted effort to diversify the flow of credit to the rural sector, thereby promoting diversification of rural economic activities.",
