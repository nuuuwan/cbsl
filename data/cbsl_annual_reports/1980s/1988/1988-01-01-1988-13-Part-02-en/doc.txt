The increase in assets resulted from a rise in Domestic r Assets (35.7 per cent) and an increase in Other Assets and Accounts (6.7 per cent). Within Domestic Assets, increases were recorded in Loans and Advances to Govern­ment (17.6 per cent), Medium and Long Term.Credit (14.1 per cent), Short Term Loans (8.7 per cent), Contributions to Financial Institutions (10.0 per cent), and in , Government and Government Guaranteed Securities (44.8 per cent). However, the International Reserve of the Bank showed a decrease of 13.8 per cent. During the year under review, the liabilities of the Bank rose mainly on account of increases in • Currency in Circulation (35.2 per cent), Deposit Liabilities (68.8 per cent) and the balance in the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund (47.1 percent). These increases were offset by a considerable decrease jin. Borrowings Abroad (87.2 percent). ,.

r , The income of the Bank for the year 1988 at Rs. 5,581.6 million showed an increase of 37.6 per cent over that for the previous year. After making allowances for expen­diture arid allocations to Reserve Accounts and provisions for depreciation, the net profit of the. Central Bank amounted to Rs. 2,010 million. A sum of Rs. 10 million is to be trahsferred'to the surplus of the Bank in terms of Section 39(b) of the Monetary Law Act.

Foreign Exchange Operations . •:>-/S

The Central Bank Continued to determine the daily spot buying and selling rates of the US Dollar against the Sri Lanka; Rupee; for its transactions with commercial banks. The spread between the spot buying and selling rates for the US Dollar was Rs. 3.00 per US$ 100. No significant policy changes in this respect were made in 1988. .

Asian Clearing Union (ACU)

The total value of transactions routed through the ACU facility during 1988 amounted to Rs. 13,407 million as compared with a total of Rs. 7,253 million in the previous year.

The rupee value of net settlements made in foreign currency in 1988 amounted to Rs. 3,305 million as compared with Rs. 577 million in 1987.

The currencies involved were, Bangaladesh Taka, Burmese Kyat, Indian Rupee, Iranian Riyal, Ne'palese Rupee and Pakistani Rupee.

The Board of Directors of the ACU who met in Colombo in February 1988, appointed a Technical Committee to study the following proposals :

(a) The Establishment of a swap facility between participating countries of the ACU. (b) The Issue of Travellers' Cheques and Credit Cards denominated in ACU currencies and/or Asian Monetary Units (AMUs).

The Technical Committee which met in Colombo in May 1988, submitted its report on these proposals to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Short Term Credit

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank Rate) on short term advances to commer­cial banks secured by the pledge of Government and Government Guaranteed Securities and against the pledge of Usance Promissory Notes relating to commercial and production loans continued to remain at 10 per cent per annum upto December 12,1988. In terms of Section 83(l)(c) of the Monetary Law Act, the Bank established on December 13,1988 a scheme of granting temporary accommodation to commercial banks to overcome their liquidity problems; the rate of interest for such accommo­dation was 15 per cent per annum. The scheme was expected to cease on January 31, 1989.

The Central Bank's accommodation to commercial banks under export credit refinance schemes continued to be in operation throughout the year. The period of refinance for both traditional (Category I) and non-traditional (Category II) exports remained at 90 days. However, extensions by a further 30 day period were provided on a case by case basis upto a total of 120 days for both categories. The Central Bank also decided to grant relief to.exporters by extending the period of loans granted under the Export Credit Refinance Facility during the period October 1, 1988 to January 31, 1989 upto a maximum of 150 days on a case by case basis. This facility was expected to be withdrawn on January 31, 1989.

The rate of interest in respect of refinance for export credit under Category I re­mained at 11 per cent per annum with an on-lending rate of 14 per cent per annum ; for Category II exports, the corresponding rates applicable were 6 per cent per annum and 9.8 per cent per annum, respectively. The global limit of refinance remained

( .v )

at Rs. 1,663 million under Category I of the Export Credit Refinance Facility. The Central .Bank continued to refund 4,percentage points per annum of the interest .charged on, the refinance loans granted, to be passed on to the customers, on export transactions for > which the sale-proceeds of the related exports are received in Sri Lanka within stipulated time .limits. However,: the grant of the interest rebate of 4 percentage points applied only to the initial period of, 9.0 days for both categories.

The rate of interest on Central Bank Advances against the pledge of Usance Pro­missory Notes of Co-operative Societies or of individuals relating to the production of paddy, vegetables and other specified food crops Continued to remain at 1.5 per cent per annum. These advances were disbursed under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme. . ?. .,.

The rate of interest on Central BankVadvances to commercial banks against the pledge of Usance Promissory Notes, in respect of advances granted to Co-opeative Societies, Agrarian Service Centres and authorised persons, to finance the purchase of paddy and for the purchase and storage of other specified crops grown locally, remained unchanged at 3 per cent per annum.

Medium and Long Term Credit

... TheCentral Bank continued to operate the Medium and Long Term.Credit Scheme in 1988. in addition to the normal refinance facilities offered under the Scheme, the Bank also continued to refinance the capitalisation of overdue interest and loan instalments of the tourism industry. In accordance with a Cabinet directive, the Central Bank reduced the interest rate of 8 per cent per annum charged on refinance loans granted to,tne tourism industry to 1 per cent per annum as of April 1, 1988. Further, the Central Bank granted interest free loans under a Rescheduling Scheme for the Fisheries Sector Bank Rehabilitation Loans and loans granted for the cultiva­tion of Chinese Ginger.

" The! balance' in1 this'Medium and "Long Term Credit Fund was increased from Rs:. 1,275 million to'Rs. 1,875 million in December 1988, of which Rs. 1,148 million was outstanding from credit institutions as at December'30, 1988.

In addition, in terms of Section 16, Sub-Section 3(A) of the Control of Finance Companies' Act, the Central Bank established a scheme of granting financial accommo­dation to commercial 'banks in fiesjpect' of their lending operations with non-bank financial institutions having temporary liquidity problems and/or whose adminis­tration ahd managementhad beentaken Over by the Monetary Board. '

A Credit Guarantee Scheme which came into operation with effect from March 16, 1987, provides guarantees for loans disbursed under designated credit schemes of Category I of the Medium and' Long Term Credit Scheme. In' 1988, the "Credit Scheme • for Dairy Development", • the "Sri Lanka ADB Livestock Development Project Loan Scheme" and the "Village adoption and Self Employment Scheme" for Anuradhapura District were brought under the Credit Guarantee Scheme.

( VI )

Reserve Requirements V

With effect from February 26, 1988, the statutory reserve ratio on demand, time and savings deposit liabilities of commercial banks was raised by 3 percentage points to 13 per centum. It was further raised by 2 percentage point's to 15 per centum with effect from September 16,1988. On both occasions, commercial banks were permit­ted to maintain the increases in the form of Sri Lanka Government Treasury bills. Consequently, the quantum of Treasury bills that could be held for the purpose of re­serve requirements was 5 percentage points within the reserve ratio of 15 per centum.

Secondary Market Operations in Treasury Bills

The Central Bank continued its operations in Treasury bills in the Secondary Market. The sales turnover of Treasury bills increased from Rs. 48,808 million in 1987 to Rs. 61,361 million in 1988. The purchases turnover also increased from Rs. 24,255 million to Rs. 25,399 million over the same period.

Investments in the Secondary Market by the non-banking sector showed a signi­ficant increase in 1988, compared with that of the previous year. The net sales turn­over to the non-banking sector increased to Rs. 7,560 million in 1988; from Rs. 6,098 million in 1987.

The discount rates applicable to the Treasury Bills Secondary Market Operations varied between 10 per cent and 13 per cent in the first half of the year and between 13 per cent and 18 per cent in the second half of the year.

Subsidy and Ex-gratia Payment to Indian Repatriates

The Bank continued to operate,,on behalf, of the Government, the two schemes to expedite the repatriation of estateworkers.of.Indian.origin.covered under the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of 1964. . . • ••. _'.'.'. ."

Import Duty Rebate to Exporters

. The Bank continued to reimburse.on behalf of the Government,claims made by commercial banks in respect of import duty.rebates paid to exporters. A total sum of Rs. 798 million was reimbursed during 1988.

Compulsory Savings Fund

The Central Bank continued to be the custodian of the monies collected in terms of ttieCompulsory Savings Act No. 6 of 1971 and the Ceiling on Income and Compul­sory Savings Law No. 15 of 1972 on behalf of the Government. During the year, the Bank paid out Rs. 1.2 million (inclusive, of interest) to contributors in respect of 411 applications received.

CURRENCY ISSUE • •' •- • r ••

. Currency in circulation continued to rise in 1988 to meet the increasing demand for currency. ;The total currency issue rose by Rs. 5,308 million or 35,per cent oyer the previous year and stood at Rs". 20,371 million as at the end of the year.

The value of notes in circulation rose to Rs. 19,553" million, 36 per cent higher than the level-'at the end.of 1987. l^ptes in circulation comprised 96 per cent of the total currency issue at end-1988. In terms of value, the Rs. 1,000/- note represented 44. per cent of.total notes in circulation, followed, by Rs. 5,00/r, Rs.,100/-, Rs. 50/-, Rs. 10/- and Rs; 20/T in that order...'.* In termsof vplujne, Rs. 10/- note had the highest circulation, followed by Rs),' 100/-, Rs. 50/>Rsi20/-, ^ s . 500/- and Rs,. 1,000/- in that order, , The Bank continued with the policy, of progressive withdrawal from circulation of the notes of the denominations of Re. 1 /-,, Rs. 2/- and Rs! 5/-.

BANKING DEVELOPMENT

During 1988, the indigenous private banking sector was further strengthened with the establishment of the Seylan Trust Bank Ltd., which commenee^Susirieskon Mar^l 24*.1988; With; this new bank, the total number of commercial banksoperating in the country rpse,.to.. 25 asat the end , of. December, :vl988, comprising, 19 foreign banks and 6 indigenous banks. A total of 8 bank branches was also opened during the year. -~ ,. / V " , , ... , .,, ; ;. ... ...

In 1988, Uie Bank of Ceylon closed down its Giriigathhena branch in the District of Nuwara-Eliya consequent on the amalgamation of banking activities'of the Gini-gathhena branch with the Nawalapitiya branch in the Karidy District." The Central Road branch Pettah and the Keppitipola branch of the Bank of Ceylon were also amalgamated with the Central Supermarket branch arid the Welimadabranch, respectively: "As a result, the Pettah Central Road branch and the Keppitipola branch wefeclosed down. The Bank of Ceylon's AgricuIture^Service Centre branches at Welimada, Wattegama and Mawathagama were up-graded to the'status of main branches. However, the total number of main branches of the Bank of Ceylon which st<5od:at'239 at the end of 1987, remained unchanged at the same level at the end of -15988.' The People's Bank'did not open any'new branches during 1988." It appears that in 1988 the state banks placed greater emphasis on rationalization of the existing

( viri )

branch net-work rather than on the establishment of new branches. The Commer­cial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. opened a new branch at Maharagama, bringing its total number of branches to 16 as at the end of 1988. The Sampath Bank Opened 3 branches at Borella, Nugegoda and Pettah. With the Seylan Trust Bank which commenced business in March 1988, the total number of main branches of commer­cial banks, excluding branches of RRDBs, as at end December 1988 stood at 628. The National Savings Bank contributed to the expansion of the bank branch network in the country by opening 2 branches during 1988, at Narahenpita and Horana.

The enactment of the Banking Act No. 30, of 1988 was another important event in the field of banking development in Sri Lanka in 1988. With the enactment of this Act, the legal provisions relating to commercial banks were consolidated into a general banking legislation, in order to ensure that the banking system in the country develops in an orderly manner.

Another event of significance in the field of banking was the implementation of the concept Of 'agency banking'. On a suggestion made by the Government, the Bank of CeylOnand the People's Bank implemented an agency banking scheme on an island wide basis .during the latter part of 1988. In addition, the Sampath Bank too planned a similar scheme as a pilot project in the Biyagama area. Under the Agency Banking Scheme, the agents appointed by the banks on a criterion stipulated by them are provided with loanable funds against security. The agents are expected to relend the funds to borrowers at a lending rate subject to a maximum stipulated by the relevant bank. With the implementation of this scheme, it is expected that the borrowers will be able to' obtain funds at a relatively low cost and that the average rate of interest in the informal rural sector would decrease.

BANK SUPERVISION

In 1988, the Central Bank concluded the examinations of five commercial banks which had commenced in i987. Examinations in respect of a further eleven com­mercial banks, including 2 Regional Rural Development Banks were undertaken in 1988. The Bank continued to monitor the financial condition of commercial banks on the basis of monthly statements of Assets and Liabilities furnished by them. The profitability of commercial banks in 1987 was also analysed on the basis of returns furnished by them.

The Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 came into effect on September 16, 1988 and the Bank was engaged in framing the directions/operating instructions that were to be issued under the new Act. The Bank also monitored, on a semi-annual basis the training provided to staff by foreign banks operating in Sri Lanka.

The Central Bank continued the monitoring of the transactions of Foreign Currency Banking Units, established by commercial banks under the Foreign Currency Banking Scheme, on a monthly basis.

(( IX )

The Bank'administered the Deposit Insurance Scheme covering Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Development Banks and Co-operative Rural Banks which commenced in 1987. Applications-for insurance cover were received from 156 Co-operative Rural Banks; and 12 of-these Banks were examined prior to their applications being considered. (Of the 12 Co-operative Rural Banks examined, 5 were in the Colombo District, 6 in the Gampaha District and 1 in the Kurunegala District). Two com­mercial banks, two Regional Rural Development Banks and one Co-operative Rural Bank were admitted to the Scheme.

SUPERVISION OF FINANCE COMPANIES

The Monetary Board in December, 1988 approved the setting up of a new Depart­ment for Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions, to regulate and super­vise finance companies under the hew Finance Companies Act No. 78^ of 1988.

In 1988, one new finance company was registered by the Monetary Board bringing the total number registered to' 72 as at the end of the year.

On-site examinations of 32 finance companies which started in the latter part of 1987 was concluded during 1988. Several spot examinations too were conducted to verify the compliance by finance companies with the rules, regulations and direc­tions issued by the Central Bank. Special emphasis was placed on monitoring the maintenance of the required levels of liquid assets and capital funds. In addition, continuous supervisipn,of finance companies was carried out using information furnished by them to the Central Bank at regular intervals.

Several finance companies came to face serious financial difficulties during the year making them unable to honour their obligations to depositors. Of these, four companies were suspended in 1988. As the existing laws under the Control of Finance Companies Act were found inadequate to deal with these complex problems, it was decided to augment the powers of the,Central Bank pending the passage of the, new legislation. Accordingly, the Central.Bank was vested with certain additional powers by regulations made by H. E. the President, in terms of Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance in June, 1988. Thereafter, the administration and management of the four suspended companies were vested with the Monetary Board. Subsequen­tly, two of these were handed over to management agencies, while auditors have been appointed to conduct comprehensive audit of the other two companies. Later, the restrictions imposed on one finance company were withdrawn and approval was granted for it to carry-on normal operations. Under the new regulations, the Monetary Board was empowered to take over the administration and management of any finance company, enter into an agreement with a management company to administer the affairs of a company vested with the Monetary Board, remove any Director from the Board of Directors of a finance company and if deemed necessary appoint auditors to audit the books and accounts of a finance company.

In December, 1988, the Parliament repealed the existing Control of Finance Companies Act No. 27 of 1979 and enacted a comprehensive new legislation in the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988, which became law on December 18, 1988. Under the provisions of this Act, the powers of the Monetary Board were further

( x, )

enhanced. The Monetary Board was permitted to impose heavy penalties on finance companies for violating provisions of the Act and the rules and directions" made under it. It is a requirement under the Act that the finance companies be .made public companies and maintain at. all times an. unimpaired capital of. not less than. Rs. 5 million. A period of 2 years be granted for finance companies to comply with the conditions stipulated in the law. The new legislation also provided for the Monetary jBoard.tq extend temporary financial accommodation to finance companies (including refinance under the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund established under; Section 88A of the Monetary Law Act.) In 1988, two companies have availed them­selves of such refinance assistance. . ; . ; • ; . ; . ; i ...»:

During 1988, several measures were taken, to.strengthen the supervisory role of the Central Bank on finance companies. -In June 1988, the upper ceiling of 18. per cent-per annum fixed for deposits accepted by finance companies was relaxed, because of the rising trend in interest rates in the market, when the maximum rate, of interest payable on deposits was raised to 20 per,cent per annum.. In August,r1988 a further relaxation was made where the maximum rates of interest payable on deposits with a maturity period of less than 24 months was raised to simple interest-of 21 per cent per.annum and interest payable on deposits after a maturity ;of 24 months and above was raised.to simple interest of 24 per cent per annum.

The Monetary Board also" decided in December, 1988 to provide some relief to depositors^of finance companies in distress; The relief payment was to- bemadeto-depositors in respect of the principal sum of matured deposits ai at December 31,' 1988. A sum of Rs. 20,000 or 50 per cent of the matured deposit, exclusive of interest and whichever is less in respect of each deposit, was to be made, subject to deductions of loans and other dues to the finance companies by the depositor. More­over, in order to extend the relief scheme to depositors of finance companies where legal proceedings have been instituted for winding up of such companies, the" Central; Bank sought court approval for the stay of legal action and permission to take over the administration and management of such companies by the Monetary Board or by its appointed agents. > . . . . . . . . .

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE

Medium and Long-term Credit Fund

Approval of refinance under Categories II, III & IV of the Medium .& Long-term Credit Fund aggregated to Rs. 255 million in 1988, reflecting an increase of Rs, 120 million over that of the previous year. The major share of refinance amounting.to Rs. 176 million or 69 per cent was on rehabilitation of sick industries, which include^ loans granted for refurbishing of hotels and capitalization of interest in arrears, on loans granted to tourist hotels. Approval of refinance for the agricultural sector in 1988 almost doubled compared to the 1987 level and amounted to Rs. 43 million. The entirety of this amount was in respect of approvals granted tameet the domestic cost of the Medium Term Investment Programme for the plantation sector. Utili­zation of refinance for the 'export' and 'industry' sectors remained low during the year. A breakdown of refinance approvals is given in Table 2.2.

Small and Medium Industry—II (SMI-U) Scheme

The total number of credit guarantees issued under the scheme during 1982-87 was 2,510. The number of loans fully repaid by end of 1988 was 70 and the guarantees withdrawn/lapsed totalled 109. The liability admitted upto the end of 1988 in respect of 15 guarantees amounted to Rs. 1.8 million and a sum of Rs. 13 million had been collected as premia.

Small and Medium Industry—III (SMI-III) Scheme

The SMI-III was operative with effect from April, 1988. Unlike the two previous schemes, SMI-III is jointly financed by the IDA and the ADB. The IDA has approved SDR 15.5 million equivalent to US $ 20 million. The ADB had contri­buted US $ 15 million. The NDB had been designated the executing apex agency and would receive rupee funds from the Government of Sri Lanka, equivalent to US $ 29.5 million, to refinance loans granted by the participating credit institutions (PCIs) for SMI projects. The balance US $ 5.5 million was for technical assistance for designated purposes. The SMI-III scheme is broadly similar to the SMI-I and II schemes, except for the following changes.

Under SMI-III, the equity contribution to a SMI project has been increased to 25 per cent of the project capital, compared with the 20 per cent requirement under SMI-II. Similarly, the extent of NDB refinance has been reduced from a maximum of 80 per cent of the permissible loan, to 75 per cent. The maximum sub-loan remains at Rs. 4 million with provisions to consider under exceptional circumstances loans in excess of Rs. 4 million. Under the credit guarantee schemes of SMI-I & II, the extent of guarantee was 60 per cent of the loan granted or the amount in default including interest and other bank charges in arrears, whichever is lower, subject to a maximum of Rs. 400,000 and Rs. 1.2 million, respectively. Under SMI-III, a three-tier credit guarantee scheme has been introduced with variable extents of guarantee for different sizes of loan in the following manner, subject to a maximum cover of Rs. 1.6 million for each project.

The guarantee liability of the Central Bank under SMI-III is limited to the princi­pal amount in default, whereas under the SMI-I and II schemes, the guarantee liabi­lity included the principal amount, as well as other charges such as interest in arrears and other bank charges.

The total number of loans granted under the SMI-III scheme upto the end of December, 1988 was 263, amounting to Rs. 155 million, of which the value guaran­teed by the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 110 million. An industry-wise classification of projects financed under SMI-II and III schemes is given in Table 2.5.

Follow-up and Inspection of Projects

The follow-up and inspection of projects financed under the SMI schemes were continued in 1988 with a view to taking corrective action where necessary. There was, however, some lag in the follow-up work during the latter part of the year due to unsettled conditions in the country. During 1988, 109 projects were inspected and most of these projects were located in Colombo, Kegalle and Kurunegala Districts.

SMI Funds

Effective from July, 1988, the Central Bank commenced investing its SMI funds in the Primary and Secondary Treasury bills markets. The investments outstanding as at the end of 1988 were Rs. 110 million. Total income received from investments during the year amounted to Rs. 3.4 million.

Entrepreneurship Development

The Central Bank Entrepreneurship Development Programme inaugurated in 1987 was suspended in 1988 owing to the unsettled conditions in the country. In some instances, the scheduled programmes were enventually cancelled because of the unwillingness of resource persons drawn from certain specialized agencies to travel to provincial towns. All these programmes have been rescheduled for implementa­tion in 1989.

RURAL CREDIT

The Central Bank plays a vital role in formulating and implementing policy guide­lines on rural credit, with a view to ensuring uniformity in approach to lending and co-ordination of the institutions involved in developing the rural sector. The Bank seeks to influence the commercial banks and thereby promote lending to the rural sector through the provision of refinance and credit guarantees.

Short-term refinance to banks is provided under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) against loans granted for the cultivation of paddy and sub­sidiary food crops. The total volume of loans granted under this scheme in Yala 1988, when compared to Yala 1987, decreased by 15 per cent from Rs. 124 million to Rs. 105 million, whereas the loans granted during 1987/88 Maha increased margi­nally over the previous season by 5 per cent to Rs. 275 million. The drop in the volume of loans granted in Yala 1988 was due to the unsettled conditions that pre­vailed in the country, coupled with the non-availability of water for lands in under-irrigated areas.

The 'roll-over facility' introduced under the NCRCS enabled banks to reschedule loans given to non-wilful defaulters. In Yala 1987, the number and value of loans rescheduled stood at 314 and Rs. 1 million, respectively, compared to 745 loans valued at Rs. 5 million during Yala 1986. The number and value of loans resche­duled in Maha 1987/88 stood at 2,228 and Rs. 11 million, respectively, reflecting a significant increase from the previous Maha 1986/87 season, when 1,920 loans valued at Rs. 7 million were rescheduled.

( XVII )

Under the credit guarantee facility extended to cover NCRCS loans, the total indemnity claims by the bank in Yala 1987 amounted to Rs. 2.3 million, of which Rs. 1.1 million was paid to the banks as the first instalment of the claim.

In 1988, certain modifications were made to the NCRCS in regard to scales of finance. Owing to the increase in the price of fertilizer, pesticides, cost of seeds and labour, the scales of finance were increased by 50 per cent in October 1988, which should become effective from Maha 1988/89. The revised scales cover eleven crops, viz, paddy, potatoes, chillies, red onions, bombay onions, green gram, black gram, cowpea, ground nuts, maize and soya been. Although the cost of these inputs vary from district to district, the scales were formulated on the basis of district averages to ensure uniformity.

With regard to medium and long-term lending, the amount of refinance utilized by lending banks upto the end of 1988 was Rs. 294 million. There were twnety three Medium and Long-Term Credit Schemes in operation in 1988 ; no new schemes were introduced in the year under review. The Credit Scheme for the construction of small on-farm potato seed stores, Credit Scheme for traders displaced under the Victoria Project and the (short-term) Marketing Loan Scheme for financing the purchase of soya bean, maize and other pulses by the Ceylon Oils and Fats Corporation (COFC) were cancelled. The last scheme was designed to ensure a guaranteed price for selected farmers through contract farming. As the objective of the scheme had not been realised, this scheme was suspended. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka/ADB Rural Development Project Scheme was terminated, as the period of operation of the schemes had expired. The Special Credit Scheme to Assist Estate Sector Women in Income Generating Activities under the FAO/Women's Bureau Project, which was operated on a pilot basis, was terminated for the same reason. The Vavuniya-Mannar Districts Integrated Rural Development Project was suspended on the advice of IDA due to disturbances in the project area.

The performance of credit schemes under the MLCF Category I is given in Table 2.6. Due to the civil disturbances in the country, disbursement of funds under a large number of schemes was slow in 1988. There was no drawdown on refinance funds under the Credit Scheme for the construction of fertilizer stores by MPCSs' the Credit Scheme for the purchase of draught animals and the Credit Scheme for beach seining. In contrast, all self-employment schemes recorded favourable trends due to the wide range of activities for which loans could be granted. Despite slow progress made in some schemes, the All Island Farm Machinery Loan Scheme and Credit Schemes for Dairy and Livestock Development and Sugarcane Cultivation recorded a large drawdown on refinance allocations. The Credit Scheme for Out-growers for cultivation of sugarcane under the Pelwatte Sugar Project, however, recor­ded low disbursement because, unlike a similar scheme targetted to permanent settlers under the project, Outgrowers were not engaged full-time in sugarcane cultivation and, therefore, the banks were reluctant to provide credit for sugarcane cultivation.

The Bank continued to play the role of an executing agency for the credit com­ponent of the Kirindioya Irrigation and Settlement Project Phase II. In this regard, the Bank has been co-ordinating the activities of the participating credit institutions in providing credit to farmers for procurement of farm machinery. Apart from this, the Bank has also been designated as the excuting agency for the credit components in respect of the following projects :

(1) ADB funded Mid Country Perennial Crops Development Project.

(2) ADB funded Agriculture Rehabilitation Project for the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka.

(3) ADB funded Small Holder Tea Development Project.

A loan agreement was signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and the ADB for the implementation of the Mid-Country Perennial Crops Development Project indicated above. The loan would become effective from March, 1989. In regard to the other two projects, negotiations have been finalised between the Government and the ADB and the loan agreements are expected to be signed in the first quarter of 1989.

The Bank has been entrusted with the responsibility of implementing a poverty alleviation programme under the "Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project" funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and Cana­dian International Development Association (CIDA). A loan agreement was signed between the IFAD and the Government of Sri Lanka on April 20, 1988 for the imple­mentation of this project.

The loan is expected to become effective during the first quarter of 1989 and will run over a period of 6 years from the effective date. The project will be operated in 4 districts, namely, Kandy, Puttalam, Galle and Matara. IFAD will provide the loan component of the project in Kandy and Puttalam districts and CIDA will finance the loan component of the project in Galle and Matara districts. The project aims at raising the living standards of approximately 32 impoverished households, who are unable to obtain loans from institutional sources within the 4 districts, by granting short and medium term loans to enable them to engage in income generating activities. Credit will be extended to eligible borrowers identified by the Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs), Project and District Offices and several national and international participating agencies.

There are several features which are unique to this project. First, credit is tar-getted to marginal and landless farmers who live below the absolute poverty line, viz, those whose net household annual income is less than Rs. 2,400/- . Second, as these borrowers lack collateral, unsecured credit will be granted primarily on a group basis along the lines of the Grameen Bank, Bangladesh, at an on-lending rate of 16 per cent per annum (compared to 12 1/2 per cent per annum which has hitherto characterised loans covered by Central Bank refinance). Third, participating agen­cies will act as 'barefoot bankers' in canvassing loans from this 'high risk' category of borrowers. Fourth, recognising that credit granted to women readily, benefits

( xxi )

the entire family, women will be given equal opportunities to participate in the project. Emphasis will, therefore, be placed on granting credit to women's groups and female-headed households. Finally, due to acute pressures on the land and the need to diversify the production base, credit will be granted for innovative and low cost agro-based and service-oriented enterprises. During the second half of 1988, the Central Bank took steps to fulfil the conditions for signing of participating agreements with the participating organisations, namely, Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Develop­ment Service (SEEDS), Women's Bureau, Lanka Mahila Samithi and the Federation of Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies (FTCCSs), and signing of sub-subsidiary agreements with the Puttalam and Kandy RRDBs.

REGIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS (RRDBs)

In the last quarter of 1988 two new RRDBs were established in the districts of Nuwara-Eliya and Moneragala bringing the total number of RRDBs in operation to 11 as at the end of 1988. During the year, 19 RRDB branches were opened and there were 80 branches scattered in 11 districts by the end of 1988. Despite the civil dis­turbances that prevailed in the country, the RRDBs made a considerable effort to expand their services, particularly to the rural poor. (Table 2.7).

Considerable progress in the mobilization of deposits was observed in 1988. The total amount of deposits mobilized by all RRDBs nearly doubled from Rs. 53 million on 87,978 accounts as at the end of 1987 to Rs. 103 million on 144,516 accounts as at the end of 1988. Approximately 87 per cent of the total deposits was accounted for by the ordinary savings accounts and the share of fixed deposits in total deposits was only about 13 per cent. This indicates that the RRDBs were servicing mainly the relatively poor in rural areas. The figures show that the average value of deposits per account has risen from Rs. 602 in 1987 to Rs. 716 in 1988, with both savings and fixed deposits taken together. Detailed data on deposit mobilization; are presented in Table 2.8.

The year 1988 also witnessed a considerable expansion in loan operations. The number of loans disbursed increased by 24 per cent from 13,801 during 1987 to 17,127 during 1988. The amount of loans disbursed rose from Rs. 96 million during 1987 to Rs. 109 million during 1988, showing a decline in the average size of loan from Rs. 6,966 in 1987 to Rs. 6,348 in 1988. This decline in the average loan size could be considered a reflection of the greater preference of RRDBs for relatively small loans demanded mainly by the poor. Selected details on loans disbursed by each RRDB are given in Table 2.9. The purpose-wise distribution of loans in 1988 shows that the RRDBs have assigned a high priority to agriculture. As shown in Table 2.10, approximately 44 per cent of the total quantum of loans was for agricultural purposes. The total quantum of loans disbursed to agriculture increased markedly by 36 per cent, from Rs. 35 million in 1987 to Rs. 47 million in 1988. The fact that 18 per cent each of the total quantum of loans was for small industries and for trade and business purposes clearly show that these banks have made a concerted effort to diversify the flow of credit to the rural sector, thereby promoting diversification of rural economic activities.

RURAL BANKING AND STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

In response to the rising demand for human resources development in the banking sector, the Rural Banking and Staff Training College (RB&STC) of the Central Bank provides necessary training to banking personnel. The training courses aim at imparting new knowledge to the participants, thereby enhancing their skills to enable them to perform better in the future.

In 1988, RB & STC organized and conducted 34 training courses and seminars in which 1,277 persons participated. Of these participants, 826 were from com­mercial banks, 82 were from Regional Rural Development Banks and 240 were from the Central Bank. Almost all the participants were in the middle or lower manage­ment levels in the banking sector.

The training provided by RB & STC was in areas such as management development, use of computers, hire purchase and lease financing, commercial banking, rural ban­king, entrepreneurship development, project-oriented development in small scale agriculture including animal husbandry, export promotion etc.

EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND

In terms of the EPF Act, the monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is charged with the responsibility of receiving contributions, surcharges and income from the investment of monies of the Fund, maintaining proper accounts of registered employers and the individual members of the Fund and also effecting refund of bene­fits to its members. These activities were carried out in close co-operation with the Employees' Provident Fund Division of the Department of Labour which attends to the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the EPF Act.

( XXVI )

Contributions

The contributions received by the Fund during the year 1988 amounted to Rs. 2,680 million as against Rs. 2,194 million in 1987. This represents an increase of Rs. 486 million or 22 per cent over the level of contributions received during the previous year.

Members' Balances

Members' balances as at December 31, 1988, before allocation of interest for the year under review stood at Rs. 24,758 million which is an increase of Rs. 2,188 million or 9 per cent over that of 1987.

Investments

During the year under review, the Fund invested a sum of Rs. 6,957 million in Government Securities, Treasury bills and in Rupee Loan Stock held by the Sinking Funds of the five National Housing Debentures, as against a sum of Rs. 4,410 million in 1987. This is an increase of Rs. 2,548 million over the level of investments in 1987.

Income Received from Investments

In 1988, the income received from investments amounted to Rs. 2,885 million as against Rs. 2,379 million in 1987, recording an increase of Rs. 506 million.

Refunds

The total sum paid out by way of refund of EPF benefits to members during the year 1988, amounted to Rs. 600 million as against Rs. 574 million in 1987. This records an increase of Rs. 26 million or 5 per cent. During the year under review, 30,661 claims for refund of benefits were paid out, which included 378 claims from repatriates of Indian origin.

Interest on members' Balances

The Employees' Provident Fund is required to pay interest on members' balances as at the end of each year, out of the income from investment of monies of the Fund. The rate of interest payable on members' balances as at the end of 1988 was fixed at 13 per cent per annum, an increase of 0.5 percentage points over the rate which prevailed during the previous year.

Interest is paid on the cumulative balance standing to the credit of members at the end of the year. All contributions received during the year irrespective of the date of receipt of such monies qualify for the payment of the interest for the entire year -e.g. contributions received in December attracts interest for the full year in the same way as contributions received in January of that year. Therefore, the effective rate of interest is somewhat higher.

Recording of Balances in EPF Account Books

Recording of balances in EPF Account Books issued by the Department of Labour continued during the year under review.

1. Exports

(a) Authorised Dealers were informed that the Coconut Development Authority was not proceeding with the indicative price scheme for coir fibre which was introduced on abolition of the floor price scheme for coir fibre products. (Operating Instructions bearing No. EC/01/88 (H) of 1988.01.01.)

(b) The Floor Price Scheme pertaining to the export of spices and other products was withdrawn with effect from 1988.01.27. (Operating Instructions bearing No. EC/03/88 (H) of 1988.01.27.)

(c) Authorised Dealers were informed that the requirement of obtaining a licence from the Controller of Imports and Exports for the export of rubber from Sri Lanka was rescinded with effect from 1988.01.01. (Operating Instructions bearing No. EC/04/88(H) of 1988.01.29).

EPF Housing Loan Scheme

The EPF Act was amended during the year 1988 to enable the members to obtain a loan of upto 75 per cent of the balance standing to their credit from lending insti­tutions for a housing purpose, which includes purchase of house/property and redemp­tion of mortgages, etc. on production of a certificate of balance standing to their credit issued by the Central Bank for this purpose. This obviates the need for mort­gaging immovable property or providing guarantors to obtain a loan.

REGIONAL OFFICES—MATARA, ANURADHAPURA AND MATALE

During 1988, the'thfee Regional Offices at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale continued their assistance to development work on an increasing scale, especially encompassing those engaged: in small scale economic activities. Project identi­fication and appraisals, recommendation of projects for financing by commercial banks, training programmes and monitoring of the implementation of rural credit programmes were among their main activities. ' ...

The activities of the three Regional Offices were aimed at promoting greater diver­sity and increasing employment opportunities in the regional economy. Thus, their operations were focussed not only on agriculture but also on numerous small scale industries and services. . ... . —

In the sphere of agriculture, an attempt was made to increase the effectiveness of the implementation of the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme.' The Matara Regional Office continued the "Model Yaya" system'Of credit for paddy cultivation in association with the Bank of Ceylo.n and Matara Regional Rural Development Bank. In the disbursement of agricultural credit, the importance of the Credit Camp System was emphasized in order to reduce the transaction.costs of both lenders and borrowers. ' " . . . . .

( xxXI-; ) •

During 1988, under the Self-employment; | L e ^ Credit Scheme, the Matara and Matale Offices recommended 115 and 200 projects for financing, respectively, involving a total loan amourit of Rs. 3 million:- The Aniiradnapura Regional Office identified a total of 2,405 viable-pf6jec^'du^ng'%he:^eaV. Commercial banks app­roved .992 o£these projeets-and -953 projects-were-m operation-by the-end of 1988. With.tbe, borrowers' contribution ofiRs: 5.7 million, the total capital investment in the'projects whichi vvere^fri;Operatibn, amounted to Rs. 15.7 million. The Anuradha­pura Office also made an-effort to popularize the use of under-ground water for the cultivation of cash crops during the off season by promoting bank finance for cons­truction of wells. • •••.!

^Since low repayment of bank loans had been a serious problem, the Regional Offices also placed special emphasis on the improvement of loan repayments in their.respe-tive regions.
