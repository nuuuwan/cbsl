As was the case in more recent years, ready-made garments and petroleum products dominated the industrial exports, accounting for about 70 per cent of the total value of industrial exports in 1989. This suggests the urgent necessity for a diversification of the structure of industrial production and exports by shifting to more value added products in order to strengthen the industrial base of the economy.",

Shorter working hours and absenteeism resulted in a decline in the output of the Textile Corporation which accounts for about 23 per cent of public sector industrial production. The drop in output of the Sri Lanka Tyre Corporation was mainly caused by reduced working hours due to disturbances. The inadequate supply of timberhad an adverse impact on the production of State Timber and Ceylon Plywoods Corporations. A decrease in demand resulting from a price revision was the main reason for the reduced output of the Ceylon Oils and Fats Corporation.",

The approval of refinance under the MLCF of the Central Bank reflected a substantial increase in 1989. The aggregate sum of refinance provided under categories ii, iii and iv amounted to Rs. 441 million in 1989, as compared with Rs. 255 million in the previous year. The increase was largely due to a rise in the number of approvals in the tourist industry for rehabilitation of hotels. The rehabilita\u00adtion of sick industries category absorbed a major share with a sum of Rs. 298 million. The amount of refinance received by the export sector increased from Rs. 19 million in 1988 to Rs. 32 million in 1989. Refinance in respect of industry amounted to Rs. 21 million in 1989 as compared with Rs. 2 million in 1988.",
