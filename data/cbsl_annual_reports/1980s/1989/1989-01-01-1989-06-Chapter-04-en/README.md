INDUSTRY

OVERALL PERFORMANCE

The industrial sector continued to maintain its growth momentum in 1989, despite continuing civil disturbances which caused interruptions to production and distribution. The value of industrial output which grew by 6 per cent in real terms in 1988, expanded by a further 6 per cent in 1989. This growth originated entirely from private sector industry which demonstrated a greater degree of resilience, despite adverse circumstances. The output of private sector industry rose by IS per cent while thai of the public sector declined by 21 per cent

In the private sector, the industrial sub-sectors which recorded large increases in production were textile and wearing apparel; food, beverages and tobacco and fabricated metal products. The sharp decline in public sector industrial output in 1989 was mainly due to production shortfalls in a number of important public sector industries, e.g. the Ceylon Petroleum, National Textile, Sri Lanka Cement, Ceylon Steel and National Paper Corporations.

The value of industrial exports increased from Rs. 22,674 million in 1988 to Rs. 28,468 million in 1989. The relative share of industrial exports in total export earnings increased from 48 per cent in 1988 to SI per cent in 1989. As was the case in more recent years, ready-made garments and petroleum products dominated the industrial exports, accounting for about 70 per cent of the total value of industrial exports in 1989. This suggests the urgent necessity for a diversification of the structure of industrial production and exports by shifting to more value added products in order to strengthen the industrial base of the economy.

INDUSTRIAL POLICY

A new industrial strategy was introduced by the Ministry of Industries with a view to restructuring the overall domestic industrial policy. This was approved by the Cabinet on December 27, 1989. The new strategy intends to (a) transform the import substituting industry to an export oriented industry, (b) provide greater employment and income opportunities, (c) diversify the economy and strengthen the balance of payments and (d) ensure a more equitable distribution of income and wealth.

The strategy also includes policy measures aimed at mobilising resources for investment and exports; encouraging foreign and local investments; reforming public enterprises; promoting a competitive environment; establishing linkages between -large and small industries; promoting research, training and marketing and removing administrative obstacles to investment, production and exports.

PRODUCTION

In real terms, the value of industrial output is estimated to have increased by 6 per cent in 1989. The overall output in private sector industries recorded an increase of IS per cent, while that of public sector industry declined by 21 per cent. When the value of petroleum output is excluded, industrial production is estimated to have increased by 10 per cent.

Industrial sub-sectors that recorded increases in production in 1989 were: fabricated metal products (17 per cent); textile, wearing apparel and leather products (16 per cent) and food, beverages and tobacco (12 per cent). The sub-sectors that recorded decreases in output were: paper and paper products (20 per cent); chemicals, petroleum and plastic products (18 percent); basic metal products (11 percent) and non-metallic mineral products (5 percent).

The value of industrial production in current terms, is estimated to have increased by

53

14 per cent in 1989. The value of textile, wearing apparel and leather products increased by 22 per cent; food, beverages and tobacco products by 26 per cent; non-metallic mineral products by 9 per cent; basic metal products by 14 per cent and fabricated metal products by 28 per cent. The output of chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products and paper and paper products declined by 7 and 2 per cent, respectively.

The improved performance within the textile, wearing apparel and leather products category was mainly due to a substantial increase in the output of ready-made garments, both within and outside the investment promotion zones. The public sector output in this category, however, declined by 2 per cent in 1989. In the food, beverages and tobacco category, private sector industries showed an impressive performance, largely due to increases in output of a number of products such as tobacco, milk products, flour, confec­tionery and meat products. The public sector in this category also recorded an increase due to the expansion of output of the Sri Lanka Sugar and National Salt Corporations.

In the chemicals, petroleum and plastic products category, increased output levels were recorded mainly in the private sector industries engaged in the manufacture of chemical products, plastic products, pharmaceuticals, soap, tooth paste, glycerine and paints. How­ever, the public sector contribution to this category recorded a sharp decline due to a substantial drop in output of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

In the wood and wood products category, an increased output level was recorded in the private sector. However, the reduced output levels of Ceylon Plywoods and State Timber Corporations resulted in a substantial drop in the output of the public sector. The decrease in the output of National Paper Corporation was largely responsible for the reduced level of output of paper and paper products. The increase in output in the fabricated metal products sector was entirely due to the performance of private sector industries engaged in the

PUBLIC SECTOR INDUSTRIES *

In real terms, the public sector industrial output decreased by 21 per cent in 1989, when compared with 1 per cent decline in the previous year. This was the outcome of production shortfalls in a number of important public sector industrial enterprises, namely the Ceylon Petroleum, National Textile, Sri Lanka Cement, Ceylon Steel, National Paper, Ceylon Oils & Fats and Sri Lanka Tyre Corporations.

The majority of public sector industrial enterprises displayed poor performance during the year. The enterprises which recorded decreases in output were: Ceylon Plywoods (65 per cent), State Timber (35 per cent), National Paper (30 per cent), Ceylon Petroleum (29 per cent), State Mining and Mineral Development (20 per cent), Ceylon Leather Products (16 per cent), Ceylon Steel (11 per cent), National Textile. (8 per cent), State Hardware (7 per cent), Sri Lanka Cement (6 per cent), Ceylon Oils & Fats (6 per cent) and Sri Lanka Tyre (3 per cent) Corporations.

The Public Sector industrial enterprises which were converted into Public Companies under the Conversion of Public Corporations or Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public Coompantes Act No. 23 of 1987 during the year, includes State Distilleries (17.10.1989), Ceylon Oils & Fats (19.10.1989), Sri Lanka Sugar (19.10.1989), Colombo Commercial (21.11.1989) and Ceylon Oxygen (05.12.89).

56

The Corporations that recorded production increases in output during the year were: Ceylon Mineral Sands (47 per cent). National Salt (41 per cent), State Distilleries (12 per cent), Sri Lanka Sugar (7 per cent) and Ceylon Ceramics (4 per cent) Corporations. The substantial increase in output of Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation was mainly due to a large increase in the output of ilmenite and increased availability of storage facilities during the year. The output of the National Salt Corporation increased mainly due to improved security conditions in the Northern and Eastern regions of the island. The expansion of harvesting area and improved security conditions in the Northern and Eastern regions of the island reflected in the increase in output of Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation.

The disruptions caused to electricity supplies, absenteeism and the interruption to production and distribution during the year had adverse effects on the performance of public sector industries. The substantial decline in output of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was partly due to the closure of the refinery for 5 weeks for maintenance purposes in the first quarter of 1989. Shorter working hours and absenteeism resulted in a decline in the output of the Textile Corporation which accounts for about 23 per cent of public sector industrial production. The drop in output of the Sri Lanka Tyre Corporation was mainly caused by reduced working hours due to disturbances. The inadequate supply of timberhad an adverse impact on the production of State Timber and Ceylon Plywoods Corporations. A decrease in demand resulting from a price revision was the main reason for the reduced output of the Ceylon Oils and Fats Corporation.

In terms of sectoral classification of corporations, food and beverages was the only category which recorded an output increase (4 per cent) in 1989. The other sectors that

57

recorded decreases in output were fabricated metal products (SO per cent); wood and wood products (SO per cent); chemical products (28 per cent); paper and paper products (30 per cent); basic metal products (11 per cent); textile, wearing apparel and leather (8 per cent) and non-metallic mineral products (4 per cent).

Budgetary transfers to public sector industrial enterprises during the year amounted to Rs. 380 million, of which 231 million (61 per cent) were current transfers and the balance Rs. 149 million (39 per cent) capital transfers. The Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation received Rs. 332 million or 68 per cent of total budgetary transfers to public corporations in 1989. Other industrial enterprises that received budgetary transfers in 1989 were State Hardware, National Textile and Ceylon Oils & Fats Corporations.

POWER AND FUEL

The sale of industrial fuel, excluding that to the Ceylon Electricity Board decreased by 7.8 per cent in 1989. Sales of furnace oil decreased by 8.2 per cent while those of heavy diesel increased by 0.5 per cent during the year.

(c) Sales other than to the Ceylon Electricity Board.

The use of electricity in industry decreased by 3.7 per in 1989. This was largely due to a drop in electricity consumption by public sector industries on account of the civil disturbances. The use of electricity in small and medium industries increased by 4.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively and that of large industries decreased by 9.6 per cent in 1989.

FACILITIES TO INDUSTRIES

The industrial sector continued to receive financial assistance on concessional terms during the year under review. The Medium and Long-term Credit Fund of the Central Bank (MLCF) and the Small and Medium Scale Industries Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMI) of the National Development Bank were two major refinancing programmes under which in­dustries received financial assistance. In addition, the Development Finance Corporation of

58

Ceylon (DFCC), the National Development Bank (NDB) and commercial banks provided direct financial assistance to industrial ventures in the form of loans and equity participation.

During the year 1989, the Central Bank continued to operate the MLCF in collaboration with commercial banks and the Export Development Board. The approval of refinance under the MLCF of the Central Bank reflected a substantial increase in 1989. The aggregate sum of refinance provided under categories ii, iii and iv amounted to Rs. 441 million in 1989, as compared with Rs. 255 million in the previous year. The increase was largely due to a rise in the number of approvals in the tourist industry for rehabilitation of hotels. The rehabilita­tion of sick industries category absorbed a major share with a sum of Rs. 298 million. The amount of refinance received by the export sector increased from Rs. 19 million in 1988 to Rs. 32 million in 1989. Refinance in respect of industry amounted to Rs. 21 million in 1989 as compared with Rs. 2 million in 1988.

By the end of December, 1989 the Central Bank had issued 2,531 guarantees covering loan disbursements of Rs. 1,393 million. By the end of the year, a sum of Rs. 52 million was fully recovered in respect of230 loans. With regard to the loans outstanding category, a sum of Rs. 268 million has fallen into arrears in respect of 548 loans. As at the end of 1989, the Central Bank had paid a sum of Rs. 9 million in settlement of 57 claims.*

The National Development Bank (NDB) provides direct financial assistance to in­dustrial projects by way of loans and equity participation. In 1989, the NDB approved 144 projects with an outlay of Rs. 1,084 million for direct financial assistance, in comparison to

59

109 projects serviced with an outlay of Rs. 840 million in 1988. The industrial categories that received the major share of this assistance were fabricated metal products; food, beverages and tobacco; chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products and textile, wearing apparel and leather products.

Commercial Banks continued to provide financial facilities to industries during 1989. Commercial banks' advances for industrial purposes amounted to Rs. 12,536 million as at the end of September, 1989. Commercial banks' advances to private sector industries absorbed Rs. 9,168 million, while public sector industrial corporations received Rs. 3,368 million.

PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT

Foreign Investments Advisory Committee

The Foreign Investment Advisory Committee (FIAC) which co-ordinates foreign investment outside the GCEC approved 62 projects in 1989, of which 39 were in the manufacturing sector.The total envisaged investment of these 62 projects amounted to 1,370 million, of which Rs. 605 million or 44 per cent comprised of foreign investments. The approved projects had an employment potential of 4,999 persons.

Of the 39 projects approved in the manufacturing sector, 11 were in the chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products category. The other manufacturing industries approved were textile, wearing apparel and leather products (6 projects); wood and paper products (6 projects); non-metallic mineral products (6 projects); basic metal products and fabricated metal products (3 projects) and other industries (7 projects). The employment potential of the projects approved in the manufacturing sector was 3,957 persons.

As at the end of 1989, the FIAC had approved 614 projects with an envisaged investment outlay of Rs. 24,132 million, of which, 320 projects with an envisaged investment of Rs. 12,088 million were in operation during the year. In regard to projects in operation, 166 were in the manufacturing sector with an envisaged investment of Rs. 3,705 million. The foreign component of this investment is Rs. 1,702 million or 46 per cent. Within the manufacturing sector, textile, wearing apparel and leather products continued to be the largest investment area both in terms of number of projects (55) and amount of investments (Rs. 939 million). The other manufacturing activities also attracted large investments. Among the categories which recorded large investments were: food, beverages and tobacco (Rs. 701 million); non-metallic mineral products (Rs. 745 million); basic metal and fabricated metal products (Rs. 598 million) and chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products (Rs. 542 million). By the end of 1989, actual employment in the FIAC projects in operation stood at 53,697 persons, with 40 per cent (or 21,401 persons) being absorbed by the textile, wearing apparel and leather products sub-sector.

Investment Promotion Zones

The Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) which is the co-ordinating body in charge of Investment Promotion Zones (IPZs), approved 24 projects in 1989, bringing the total number of projects approved to 308 by the end of 1989. As at end of 1989, agreements had been signed in respect of 178 projects, of which 118 were in commercial production. Of those projects in production, 70 were in the Katunayake Investment Promo­tion Zone (KBPZ), 23 in the Biyagama Investment Promotion Zone (BDPZ) and 25 in various other parts of the country.

In 1989, the employment in GCEC enterprises increased by 12 per cent, bringing the total number of employment in these enterprises to 61,429 persons. Of these, 42,925 or 70

60

per cent were engaged in the textile, wearing apparel and leather products sector. Neverthe­less, the relative share of employment in this category declined from 73 per cent in 1988 to 70 percent of total employment in GCEC enterprises in 1989. Food, beverages and tobacco and non-metallic mineral products were among the industrial categories which recorded the highest rate of employment generation.
