    "text": "The agricultural sector suffered a severe setback in 1989 with the output of most commodities recording decreases. The major factors contributing to this poor production performance were the drought conditions which prevailed in the early part of the year, heavy monsoonal rains experienced in the second quarter and the civil disturbances. The adverse impact of the civil disturbances was particularly severe on the tree crop sector. Tea production declined by 9 per cent, rubber by 10 per cent and only coconut showed some improvement in production among the tree crops. Meanwhile, paddy output also dropped significantly by 17 per cent in 1989. Performance of most of the minor export crops as well as minor food crops was also disappointing during the year.",

    "text": "After two consecutive years of increases, tea production in 1989 declined by about 9 per cent to 207 million kgs. The decrease in production which started in the fourth quarter of 1988, continued to hold sway in the first three quarters of 1989. Production in the low grown areas and certain parts of the medium grown areas suffered the most The drought conditions in the early part of the year delayed the expected recovery of production from the interruptions to pruning and plucking activities during the closing months of 1988. Heavy monsoonal rains experienced during the second quarter of 1989 also had an adverse impact on production. Another major contributory factor for the decline in production was the continuing civil disturbances during which the normal working pattern of the plantations was disrupted and a number of tea factories were damaged or destroyed. The drop in production was reflected in all three elevational categories of teas, but was more pronounced in the low grown areas where production fell by about 14 percent to 83 million kgs. in 1989. However, low grown tea production continued to account for the largest share (40 per cent) of total production. The output of high grown tea fell by 4 per cent to 74 million kgs. in 1989, while that of medium grown tea fell by 8 per cent to 50 million kgs.",

Both the expansion in the area brought under planting activities and the higher rate of subsidy would have contributed to that increase. Reflecting the TSHDA's concern in strengthening extension services for the enhancement of productivity of the smallholder sector, the number of extension officers was increased from 80 to 115 in 1989. Financial assistance from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was also utilised in 1989 for the provision of extension services. Preliminary work on the Smallholder Tea Development Project to be funded by the Asian Development Bank was carried out during the year. This project comprises of two parts. The first part will pay greater emphasis on the provision of funds for nursery and field development and for the rehabilita\u00adtion of privately owned factories.

Reduced world supply and increased diversion of tea to the domestic market by India were among the major factors contributing to the price upsurge. At the same time increased purchases of the U.S.S.R. in response to its own crop shortfall contributed to a strong demand at the Colombo Auctions.

Accordingly, the production of desiccated coconut and coconut oil more than doubled, while the export volume of copra recorded a significant increase of 41 per cent. The export volume of fresh nuts also increased by about one million nuts. However, production of desiccated coconut and the export volume of copra in 1989 was lower than the levels recorded in 1987. In general, the unsettled conditions which adversely affected most of the crop sectors had only a marginal impact on nut production. However, work stoppages and transport difficulties appear to have delayed processing of harvested nuts on time resulting in a deterioration in the quality of nuts. This, in turn, had a bearing on the quality and the quantity of desiccated coconut and copra production. As a result, a large quantity of coconuts had to be processed into oil. Accordingly, the share of the nut equivalent of coconut oil in total production increased from 14 per cent in 1988 to 24 per cent in 1989.",

The output of paddy in 1989 was provisionally estimated at 2.06 million metric tons (99 million bushels of paddy or 1.44 million metric tons of rice). This was the lowest production since 1979 and represents a decrease of 17 per cent over the output in the previous year. Paddy production in 1989, accounted for only about 70 per cent of the targetted level of production. The fall in production was reflected in both Maha 1988/89 and Yala, 1989 seasons. The drop was largely attributed to a substantially reduced extent sown and harvested, as well as the marginally lower average yield mainly due to drought",

Hingurana and Kantale factories accounted for the entire increase in production. Sugar production at the Hingurana factory increased for the third consecutive year by 29 per cent mainly due to increased area harvested, higher average yield, as well as larger private cane purchases. The Kantale factory reported a production increase of 62 per cent to 2,305 metric tons in 1989, after three consecutive years of decreases. The improvement in production of the Kantale factory was a result of higher average yield. The increase in production at both factories is commendable, considering the adverse impact of civil disturbances which led to work stoppages, restricted hours of work, shortage of seasonal labour for harvesting from outside areas and the abandonment of lands by certain allottees. Further wild elephants were also reported to have damaged crops, since the crop security system to some extent was weakened following the withdrawal of guns from crop watchers for security reasons. In contrast, sugar production at the Sevanagala factory dropped by 18 per cent to 9,078 metric tons, while that at Pelwatte factory declined by 5 percent to 28,350 metric tons in 1989. The drop in production at both factories was a result of reduced areas harvested, as well as a drop",

Significant decreases were also recorded in the production of chillies (34 per cent), groundnuts (24 per cent), gingelly (66 per cent), cowpea (23 per cent) and blackgram (53 per cent) during 1989, due mainly to the reduced extent cultivated. The production of maize (48 per cent), red onions (11 per cent), greengram (22 per cent), and kurakkan (54 percent) showed substantial decreases in 1989. The production of potatoes which successively declined in the previous two years, again recorded a marginal decrease of 2 per cent in 1989.

Floor prices in respect of ground nuts, gingelly, greengram and blackgram were revised upwards in 1989 with a view to encouraging the cultivation of these crops. The prices paid for groundnuts, greengram and blackgram were increased by Rs. 1 each to Rs. 8 per kg. Rs. 11 per kg. and Rs. 7 per kg., respectively. The prices of black gingelly and white gingelly were raised by 50 cents each to Rs. 8 per kg. and Rs. 9 J O per kg., respectively. However, the PMB was able to purchase only about 9,964 metric tons of maize and 226 metric tons of soyabeans during 1989. The purchases of maize and soyabeans showed significant decreases of 77 percent and 80 per cent in 1989 when compared with those in the previous year. In 1989, the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) purchased about 1369 metric tons of big onions, 387 metric tons of greengram, 47 metric tons of red onions, 39 metric tons of potatoes and 28 metric tons of blackgram in the domestic market. The CWE imported about6302metric tons of dried chillies,44,649 metric tons of red dhal and23,770 metric tons of big onions during 1989.",

    "text": "The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has provisionally estimated fish production in 1989 at 205,286 metric tons. This showed a 4 per cent increase over the previous year. Fish production of the coastal fishery sub-sector, which usually accounts for the bulk of the production (77 percent) increased only by one per cent, from 155,099 metric tons in 1988 to 157,411 metric tons in 1989. Fish production of the inland fishery sub-sector also rose by 4 per cent in 1989 to reach 39,720 metric tons. In contrast, the fish production of the off-shore and deep sea sub-sector improved significantly by 84 per cent, mainly in response to expanded off-shore fishing activities with the rapid conversion of day-boats into multi-day boats. Although the situation in the Northern and Eastern provinces showed some recovery in 1989, various fisheries activities and several fisheries projects were adversely affected by the unsettled conditions which prevailed during most of the year. Three fresh water fish breeding stations were reported to have been damaged during the civil disturban\u00adces. Further, the transportation of fish seed for stocking in water bodies was also adversely affected due to limited availability of vehicles as the vehicles attached to some fisheries stations were taken over by the security forces. Therefore, fingerlings production declined from about 5,402,000 in 1988 to 3,886,000 in 1989. The quantity of fingerlings stocked in 1989 also dropped substantially to 3,567,000 as against 4,870,000 in 1988. Under the Seasonal Tank Aquaculture Programme, only about 215,000 fingerlings were stocked in 39 seasonal tanks. This shows a setback when compared with about a million fingerlings stocked in 148 seasonal tanks during 1988.",
