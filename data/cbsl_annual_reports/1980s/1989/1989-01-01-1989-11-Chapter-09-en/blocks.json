    "text": "The fiscal outturn in 1989 turned out to be a significant improvement from the original estimates, as well as the targets set under the stabilization programme. The overall budget deficit was contained at Rs. 25,091 million (or 10.0 per cent of GDP) as compared with a targetted deficit of Rs. 31,251 million (or 12.5 per cent of GDP). The improvement was a combined effect of both increased revenue and reduced expenditure. New revenue measures introduced during the year were the key factors that contributed to an enhanced collection from major revenue sources. The government revenue/GDP ratio in 1989 was more or less at the targetted level of 21.3 per cent. Meanwhile, a greater control of public expenditure, together with low utilization of voted capital funds due to implementation difficulties resulted in a substantial reduction in government outlays. Accordingly, government's total expenditure as a proportion of GDP was maintained at 31.6 per cent, as against 33.8 per cent originally targetted. Although the current expenditure/GDP ratio at 22.0 per cent reflected a reduction from the targetted level of 22.6 per cent, it was still higher than the ratio of 20.7 per cent recorded in the previous year. However, a disconcerting feature of fiscal perfor\u00admance in 1989 was a sharp reduction in capital expenditure. Accordingly, capital expendi\u00adture as a ratio of GDP fell from 10.3 per cent in 1988 to 7.9 per cent in 1989 with consequent implications on the future growth prospects of the country.",

Meanwhile, in the context of a sharply reduced budget deficit, there was no necessity to have recourse to the banking system for financing the deficit. The overall budgetary performance in 1989 was a significant improvement over the previous year. The budget deficit as a ratio of GDP which was 15.6 per cent in 1988 declined to 10.0 per cent in 1989, while expansionary financing of the deficit which stood at 4.6 per cent of GDP was totally eliminated.",

In 1989, revenue collections from major sources such as import duties, turnover taxes, excise dudes were considerably higher than those from the same sources in 1988. Additional tax revenue amounting to Rs. 2,343 million was also generated from a tax imposed on Treasury bills held by the Central Bank. The growth in revenue from these sources contributed to raise the tax/GDP ratio from 16.1 per cent in 1988 to 19.0 per cent in 1989.",
