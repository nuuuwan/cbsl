ACCOUNTS AND OPERATIONS OF THE CENTRAL BANK

ACCOUNTS AND BANKING OPERATIONS

The Balance Sheet of the Central Bank as at December29,1989 and the Profit and Loss Account of the Bank for the year ended December29,1989are presented in Table 2.1. Total Assets/Liabilities of the Central Bank as at the end of 1989 stood at Rs.62,7705 million registering an increase of 13.4 per cent during the year. The increase in the assets was mainly due to increases in the International Reserve and other assets of the Bank. The ratio of domestic assets to total assets declined from 73.2 per cent in 1988 to 65.8 per cent in 1989, despite an increase in the value of such assets by Rs.761 million which was mainly on account of loans and advances given to Government during the latter part of the year.

The share of currency in circulation which accounted for the highest in the total liabilities declined from 37 percent in 1988to 34 per cent in 1989. However, the total value of currency in circulation increased by Rs.755 million or 3.7 per cent during 1989. There was no significant change in the share of deposits and other liabilities in total liabilities of the Bank.

A comparison of major components of assets and liabilities of die Bank is shown in Table 22. The income of the Bank for the year 1989 at Rs. 6,939.9 million showed an increase of 2 4 3 per cent over that for the preceding year. After making allowances for expenditure and allocations to Reserve Accounts and provision for Depreciation and other Charges, the net profit of the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 1,000million. A sum of Rs. 500 million is to be transferred to the surplus of the Bank in terms of section 39(b) of the Monetary Law Act The balance sum of Rs.500 million is earmarked to be paid to the Government in terms of section 39(c) of the Monetary Law Act

Foreign Exchange Operations

The Central Bank continued to determine the daily spot buying and selling rates of the U.S. Dollar against Sri Lanka Rupee for its transactions with commercial banks. The spread between the spot buying and selling rates for the U.S. Dollar was Rs. 3.00 per US$ 100. No significant policy changes in this respect were made in 1989.

The Bank continued to intervene, when necessary, in the forward market by selling U.S. Dollars forward in order to maintain stability in the forward exchange rates. The period of such cover was upto six months.

As in the past, the Central Bank invested its foreign exchange reserves in international money and capital markets.

Asian Clearing Union

The total value of transactions routed through the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) facility in 1989 amounted to Rs.16,209 million as compared with Rs. 13,407 million during the previous year.

The rupee value of net settlements made in foreign currency in 1989 amounted to Rs. 393 million as compared with Rs. 3305 million in 1988.

The Board of Directors of the ACU at its meeting held in Bombay in March, 1989 decided to introduce a swap facility among the member countries. Under this scheme which came into operation in November, 1989. Asian Monetary Units (AMUs) were made available to participating countries to settle their temporary imbalances in clearing.

Bank Rate

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank Rate) on short-term advances to commercial banks secured by the pledge of Government and Government Guaranteed Securities and against the pledge of Usance Promissory Notes relating to commercial and production loans was increased from 10 per cent per annum to 14 per cent per annum as from June 15,1989.

Short Term Credit

Central Bank's accommodation to commercial banks under Export Credit Refinance Schemes continued to be in operation throughout the year. The period of refinance for bom Category I (traditional) and Category II (non-traditional) exports remained at 90 days. However, extensions by a further 30 day period were provided on a case by case basis upto a total of 120 days for both categories. The rate of interest in respect of refinance for Export Credit under Category I remained at 11 per cent per annum with an on-lending rate of 14 per cent per annum; for Category U exports, the corresponding rates applicable were 6 per cent per annum and 9,8 per cent per annum respectively. The Central Bank continued to refund 4 percentage points per annum of the interest charged on the export credit refinance so that the lending banks could pass the benefit on to the customers on export transactions, provided the sale proceeds are received in Sri Lanka within 90 days. The global limit of refinance remained at Rs. 1,663 million under Category I of the Export Credit Refinance Facility. However, a further sum of Rs. 400 million was made available with effect from November 16,1989, as a temporary measure, to overcome the liquidity needs of the tea sector whose production, export and realisation of proceeds, were disrupted. This was withdrawn on December 15,1989. There was no limit of refinance under Category II except in the case of tea-bags and calibrated precious stones.

The rate of interest on Central Bank Advances against the pledge of Usance Promissory Notes of Co-operative Societies or of individuals relating to the production of paddy, vegetables and other specified food crops continued to remain at 1.5 per cent per annum. These advances were disbursed under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme. The rate of interest on Central Bank's advances to commercial banks against the pledge of Usance Promissory Notes, in respect of advances granted to Co-operative Societies, Agrarian Service Centres and authorised persons, to finance the purchase of paddy and for the purchase and storage of other specified crops grown locally, remained unchanged at 3 per cent per annum.

Accommodation to Finance Companies

In terms of Sections 20(4) (a) and 21(1) of the Finance Companies Act No.78 of 1988, the Central Bank continued to grant financial accommodation to commercial banks in respect of their lending operations with non-bank financial institutions which were faced with temporary liquidity problems and/or whose administration and management have been taken over by the Monetary Board. An amount of Rs. 470 million had been disbursed upto the end of 1989, on this account

Reserve Requirements

The statutory reserve ratio on demand, time and savings deposits liabilities of commer­cial banks remained at IS percent during the year. The quantum of Treasury Bills that could be held for reserve requirement purposes was 5 percentage points within the IS per cent reserve ratio.

V

The net sales turnover to the non-banking sector amounted to Rs. 7,560 million in 1988 and Rs. 15,399 million in 1989.

The discount rates applicable to Secondary Market Operations in Treasury Bills varied between 12.25 per cent to 18 per cent during the year.

Subsidy & Ex-gratia Payment to Indian Repatriates

The Bank continued to operate, on behalf of the Government, the schemes relating to the repatriation of estate workers of Indian origin covered under the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of 1964.

All these notes will carry the date February 21,1989.

BANKING DEVELOPMENT

At the end of 1988, there were 25 commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka, comprising 19 foreign banks and 6 indigenous banks with a network of 700 branches. During 1989, indigenous banks opened 19 branches, while the savings unit of a foreign bank was upgraded to a fully fledged branch. The Emirates Bank International Ltd., one of the foreign banks, ceased to operate in Sri Lanka with effect from September 29,1989 and its business was taken over by the Hatton National Bank. Thus the number of foreign banks in Sri Lanka at the end of 1989 stood at 18.

The Bank of Ceylon opened 3 new offices during the year 1989, viz. an extension office at Biyagama Free Trade Zone, a foreign employment service centre at Rakshana Mandiraya and a Pay Office at Peradeniya Campus branch. Its Mankulam branch was re-opened in August, 1989 which had been closed due to security reasons. Matale 2nd City branch was closed down and amalgamated with Matale Main branch, while the NUdandahinna Agricul­tural Service Centre (ASC) was temporarily closed down due to adverse security situation in the area. The amalgamation of Ipalogama ASC branch with Galnewa branch, Wahakotte ASC branch with Galewela branch, Digana ASC branch with Madawala branch and Srawasthipura ASC branch with Anuradhapura branch took place during the year. Further,

vn

the Weeraketiya and Wellawaya ASC branches were upgraded and consequently at end 1989, the total number of branches of Bank of Ceylon stood at 284.

Meanwhile, the Pawning Centre at Borella and the Malwatte Road branch of the People's Bank were upgraded to main branches during 1989. In addition, the People's Bank opened a new branch at Pamunugama in May, 1989 and an Extension Office at the Insurance Building bringing the total of its branches to 300 as at the end of the year.

The Hatton National Bank opened a new branch at Wattala and took over the business of the Emirates Bank International Ltd., to function as a branch. The Sampath Bank opened 7 branches at Kiribathgoda, Colombo Fort, Bambalapitiya, Katunayake Airport, Kurunegala, Navam Mawatha and Kandy during 1989. The Seylan Trust Bank opened 5 branches at Mt. Lavinia, Maharagama, Panadura, Kiribathgoda and Matara during the year under review. The National Savings Bank (NSB) also contributed to the expansion of banking services in the country by opening 3 new branches during the year at Colombo West, Weligama and Kiribathgoda increasing its total number of branches to 67 as at the end of 1989.

BANK SUPERVISION

The Central Bank commenced the examination of 14 commercial banks including two Regional Rural Development Banks in 1989 and concluded all but three of these examina­tions. The Bank continued to monitor the financial condition of commercial banks on the basis of monthly statements of assets and liabilities furnished by them. The profitability of banks in 1988 was also analysed in 1989 on the basis of returns furnished by banks. The Banks continued to monitor the transactions of Foreign Currency Banking Units established by commercial banks under the Foreign Currency Banking Scheme on the basis of monthly returns obtained from them.

The Bank issued two directives to commercial banks in April, 1989 under the provisions of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, specifying limits on maximum shareholdings of banks and on maximum exposures to large borrowers. The compliance of banks with the limits on concentration of shareholdings and facilities extended was also monitored by the Bank. At the same time, the Bank also issued a notice to commercial banks relating to determinations made by the Bank under the Banking Act These determinations, inter alia, included:

(a) minimum percentage of capital funds to be maintained by licensed commercial banks to be 4 per cent of average month-end liabilities including contingent liabilities during the preceding twelve months;

(b) minimum liquid assets to be maintained by licensed commercial banks to be 20 per cent of total liabilities less liabilities to the Central Bank and to the shareholders; and

(c) approved security against which facilities are to be provided to directors of licensed banks.

During 1989, the Bank continued to administer the Deposit Insurance Scheme which came into operation in April, 1987 with the promulgation of the Regulations under Section 32E of the Monetary Law Act. This scheme, which is optional, extends its coverage to commercial banks, regional rural development banks and co-operative rural banks of the Multi-purpose Co-operative Societies.

vm

Applications for registration as insured institutions were received from 2 commercial banks, 5 regional rural development banks and 179 Multi-purpose Co-operative Societies comprising 764 co-operative rural banks. During the year 1989, one Regional Rural Development bank and 33 Multi-purpose Co-operative Societies with a network of 139 co-operative rural banks were examined by the Bank Supervision Department of the Bank prior to their applications being considered for registration under this scheme.

As at end of December, 1989,2 commercial banks, 3 regional rural development banks and 18 co-operative rural banks of 3 Multi-purpose Co-operative Societies had been registered as insured banks and insured societies.

SUPERVISION OF FINANCE COMPANIES

The Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions which was estab­lished on December23,1988 by the Central Bank has since been in charge of the supervision of non-bank financial institutions in Sri Lanka. In 1989, the Bank placed greater emphasis on on-site examination of finance companies, while implementing new techniques of off-site surveillance.

The new policies achieved their objectives as shown by the overall performance of the finance company sub-sector in the financial system. The public deposits with finance companies increased from Rs. 6,267.9 million as at end of 1988 to Rs. 6,527.4 million as at end of 1989. There was no failure of finance companies in 1989 as against 7 failures in the previous year in spite of the highly unfavourable economic conditions that prevailed in the year. The month long strike in the transport sector during June - July adversely affected the liquidity position of finance companies, since the private sector operated public transport service is largely financed by them. However, the finance companies managed to lwade through the difficult situation. Moreover, except three small companies which were in difficulties in 1988 also, all other finance companies that experienced difficulties in 1987 and 1988 managed to improve their performance considerably in 1989 with the technical and managerial assistance of the Central Bank. Two finance companies were given financial assistance through the refinance facility of the Central Bank.

During 1989, in the process of continuous supervision of finance companies, com­prehensive on-site examinations were undertaken by the Bank in respect of 23 companies and of these examinations, 15 were completed within the year. In addition, 9 companies were subjected to detailed audit through auditors appointed by the Central Bank under Section 12(d) of the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988. The remaining few companies too were subjected to strategic on-site examinations. During 1989, several measures were taken to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory role of the Central Bank on finance companies. Following directions were issued in 1989:-

(i) With effect from April 1,1989, every finance company shall at all times maintain assets in the form of Sri Lanka Government Treasury Bills, Sri Lanka Govern­ment Securities and Central Bank of Sri Lanka Securities equivalent to six (6) per cent of the average of its month end deposit liabilities during the twelve months of the last financial year.

(ii) Every finance company shall deposit documents relating to Sri Lanka Govern­ment Treasury Bills, Sri Lanka Government Securities and Central Bank of Sri Lanka Securities referred to above with the Chief Accountant of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

DC

(iii) No finance company shall, as from April 1,1990 take into account as income, any accrued interest on a loan, credit facility or any type of financial accommoda­tion on which interest and/or capital repayments are in arrears for six months or more.

(iv) Commencing April 1,1990 every finance company shall ,(in the maintenance of the books of accounts) segregate a loan, credit facility or any type of financial accommodation to which paragraph above is applicable, from other loans, credit facility and any type of financial accommodation under separate control accounts in the general ledger.

The off-site surveillance through an Early Warning System (EWS) which was intro­duced in February, 1989 continued throughout the Year. The Monetary Board had in December 1988 approved of a scheme to grant relief to depositors of finance companies in distress. The relief payment was extended to deposits in respect of the principal sum deposited and maturing as at December 31,1989. Under this scheme, a sum of Rs. 20,000/-or SO per cent of the matured deposit, whichever is less, was to be made to depositors exclusive of any accrued interest and subject to deductions from the sum paid of loans and other dues to the finance companies. During 1989, the Board decided to grant further relief to depositors to the full extent of the principal sum, where a deposit does not exceed Rs. 10,000/-. In 1989, such relief payments were being made to depositors of five finance companies that are vested in the Monetary Board.

The payment to depositors of finance companies vested in the Bank is financed mainly by providing refinance facilities from the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund established under Section 88E of the Monetary Law Act. During 1989, five companies received the benefit of such refinance facilities amounting to Rs. S7.0 million. The progress of the relief payment scheme as at end of 1989 is given in Table 2.3

The implementation of the Depositor Relief Scheme in the distressed finance companies was impeded by several factors. The managements of certain failed finance companies have maintained unofficial records and hence, company documents do not corroborate a fair proportion of the deposit claims. Some of the claims made by the public are not based on genuine deposits. Further, creditors who are not eligible under the scheme have applied as depositors.

The Central Bank officials, in order to make sure that the relief payments are made only on genuine deposits, have to verify the information given by the depositors using inde­pendent data available at the company level. This exercise of verification has been made difficult in certain companies due to absence or improper maintenance of books and accounts and hence the implementation of the relief scheme in those companies has been impeded. Hence, the verification of deposits had to be done using other documents. In certain companies where legal proceedings are still pending as their managements have objected to the take-over by the Central Bank, the relief scheme could not be implemented.

In 1989, nine prosecutions instituted by the Fraud Bureau under the Control of Finance Companies Act No. 27 of 1979 were taken up for hearing. Of these, two prosecutions were taken up for trial in the Magistrate's Court, Colombo. Further, a complaint was made to the Criminal Investigations Department against the Directors of company for misappropriation of company funds and the case is now pending in the Magistrate's Court, Colombo.

In 1989, there has been no suspension of finance companies. However, of the companies suspended earlier, the management and administration of one company was vested in the Monetary Board. Thus, as at the end of 1989, six companies remained vested in the Board.

* Including applications on non-matured deposits.

Of these, one company was amalgamated with another finance company; two companies are being managed by a team of officers'appointed by the Board; two others are being managed by turns under agreements signed with the Board. A management team has been appointed to manage the fifth company which will commence operations in 1990. It has been decided to stay liquidation proceedings in die case of three other companies and vest' them in the Monetary Board.

As at the end of 1988, there were 72 finance companies registered with the Monetary Board. All these companies were registered under the former Act, namely the Control of Finance Companies Act No. 27 of 1979, which was repealed. No new companies were registered in 1989. However, due to the restructuring presently being implemented by the Central Bank, the total number of operational finance companies as at end 1989 was about 45. A further reduction in the number of finance companies is expected.

For finance companies to be eligible for registration under the existing Finance Com­panies Act No. 78 of 1988 they are required to become public companies and maintain an unimpaired capital of Rs. 5 million. In addition, the Monetary Board should be satisfied that the registration of a finance company would not be to the detriment of the depositors. Among the aspects that will be considered necessary for die protection of depositors would include proper internal controls, satisfactory accounting systems and procedures. A period of two years has been granted for the presently operational finance companies to comply with stipulations of the 1988 Act and this transitional period ends by December 18,1990.

To increase the public awareness of the legislative framework relevant to non-bank financial institutions, die Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions of the Bank in association with the non-governmental organisation, organised a public seminar in June 1989 on the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988. This seminar was addressed by Governor, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Dr. H.N.S JCarunatilake; Director, Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions, Dr. N.L.Sirisena; Deputy Solicitor General, Mr. Shibly Aziz, P.C, among others.

Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund

In 1989, the approval of refinance by the Central Bank under Categories II, III and TV of its Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund Scheme (MLCF) amounted to Rs. 441.0 million when compared to the previous year's approval of Rs. 255.0 million. A major portion of these approvals amounting to Rs. 298.0 million was by way of assistance to sick industries, which included capitalisation of interest in arrears on loans granted to 27 tourist hotels. Despite the unsettled conditions in the country, the approval of refinance for setting-up new projects and expansion of existing projects under Categories II, III and IV amounted to Rs. 142.0 million in 1989, an increase of Rs. 63.0 million over previous year's approvals. Of this, the refinance approvals to export-oriented projects certified by the Export Development Board amounted to Rs. 32.0 million. However, the refinance approvals in 1989to agriculture in respect of loans granted to meet the domestic cost of the Medium-Term Investment Programme (MTIP) for die plantation sector was only Rs. 9.0 million compared to the previous year's approval of Rs. 43.0 million. This, was mainly due to near exhaustion of Rs. 260.0 million (US$ 10.0 million) approved for the purpose. A breakdown of medium and long-term refinance approvals is given in Table 2.4

Credit Guarantee Operations

A summary of credit guarantee operations under the four credit guarantee schemes administered by the Central Bank is given in Table 2.6

Small-Scale Industries (SSI) Scheme

The issue of credit guarantees under the SSI scheme which commenced operations in 1978 was completed in 1981. Out of a total of 767 loans guaranteed during this period, 584 loans have been fully repaid, while 64 guarantees amounting to Rs. 3.9 million were either withdrawn or lapsed due to non-compliance with Central Bank's operating instructions by the participating credit institutions. As at the end of 1989,57 claims amounting to Rs. 1.6 million were settled, while 6 claims amounting to Rs. 0.22 million were rejected. Accord­ingly, only 56 credit guarantees with a total liability amounting to Rs. 1.1 million remained outstanding as at end of 1989. The total premia collected under this scheme upto the end of 1989 amounted to Rs. 0.94 million.

Small and Medium-Scale Industries -1 (SMI -1) Scheme

The issue of credit guarantees under SMI - 1 Scheme which commenced operations in 1979 was completed in 1982. Out of a total of 1,670 loans guaranteed under the scheme, 1,142 loans were fully repaid and 78 credit guarantees were either withdrawn or lapsed due to non-compliance with Central Bank's operating instructions by participating credit institu­tions. At the end of 1989,243 claims amounting to Rs. 19.3 million were settled, while 25 claims amounting to Rs. 5.3 million were rejected. Accordingly, only 182 credit guarantees with a total liability amounting to Rs. 15.0 million were outstanding as at the end of 1989. The total premia collected under this scheme upto the end of 1989 amounted to Rs. 11.6 million.

Small and Medium-Scale Industries - II (SMI - II) Scheme

The issue of credit guarantees under SMI - II Scheme which commenced operations in 1982 was completed in 1989. Out of a total of 2,531 loans guaranteed during this period, 230 loans to the value of Rs. 52.0 million have been repaid, while 180 credit guarantees to the value of Rs. 105.6 million had either been withdrawn or lapsed due to the non-compliance with Central Bank's operating instructions by the participating credit institutions. As at the end of 1989,57 claims amounting to Rs. 9.1 million were settled, while 19 claims to the value of Rs. 4.0 million were rejected. As at the same date, 2,045 credit guarantees with a total liability amounting to Rs. 445.0 million were outstanding. The total premia collected under this scheme upto the end of 1989 amounted to Rs. 18.4 million.

Small and Medium-Scale Industries - HI (SMI - HI) Scheme

The total number of loans guaranteed under the SMI-HI Scheme which commenced operations in July 1988 was 1,047 amounting to Rs. 637.0 million as at the end of 1989. As at this date, 3 loans amounting to Rs. 4.4 million were fully repaid, while 14 guarantees to the value of Rs. 4.6 million had either been withdrawn or lapsed due to non-compliance with Central Bank's operating instructions by the participating credit institutions. One claim received during the year was rejected. At the end of 1989,290 loans amounting to Rs. 259.4 million had not been disbursed. Since, in terms of Central Bank operating instructions, credit guarantee cover becomes effective only on the date of disbursement of loans, only 739 credit guarantees with a liability of Rs. 198.7 million were outstanding as at the end of 1989. The total premia collected under this scheme up to the end of 1989 amounted to Rs. 2.1 million.

An industry-wise classification of projects under the SMI-U and IJJ Schemes is given in Table 2.7

Follow-up and Inspection of Projects

The follow-up and inspection of projects financed under the SMI Loans Schemes were continued in 1989 with a view to taking corrective action where necessary. Some of these inspections were undertaken in order to settle claims lodged by participating credit institu­tions. During 1989, 136 projects, most of which were located in Colombo, Gampaha, Kurunegala, Chilaw and Galle districts, were inspected.

RURAL CREDIT

In 1989, the Bank continued to play the role of a credit executing agency for the following rural based projects funded by foreign agencies:

1) Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement

Project - Phase II

2) ADB funded Perennial Crops Development Project

3) ADB funded Small Holder Tea Development Project

4) ADB funded Agriculture Rehabilitation Project

In keeping with the role of a credit executing agency, the Bank entered into subsidiary loan agreements with the Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) in respect of above projects to facilitate their implementation. On 26th December 1989, the Bank entered into a technical assistance agreement with the ADB for the formulation of a second rural credit project The main objective of the technical assistance agreement is to assist commercial banks in formulating a strategy and a programme for promoting and financing investments in agricultural and agro-industrial sectors, it will also assist the Bank and commercial banks to formulate plans of action to implement the various policy and procedural changes that are recommended by the second rural credit review. The Bank "also did preparatory work and provided necessary assistance to enable the Government to enter into "Agriculture Programme Loan" agreement with the ADB. The agreement which was signed in December 1989 will provide loan funds from special fund resources for financing of imported inputs or capital goods in the agriculture and allied sectors.

The Bank which has been entrusted with the responsibility of implementing a poverty alleviation programme under the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (TFAD) continued to take necessary steps in this direction. The Project Central Office was established in March 1989 in the Rural Credit Department of the Bank to implement the project. The appointment of the staff, training of same both in Sri Lanka and abroad, identification of participating institutions were completed during 1989.

The Bank with a view to ensuring that the commercial banks provide adequate credit and undertake post-credit supervision of the credit granted to the rural sector continued to inspect the agricultural loan portfolio of selected branches of commercial banks. During 1989, inspection was' confined to few branches in view of the security situation which disrupted the operation of the banks in certain districts. Consequently, the Rural Credit Department of the Bank conducted inspection of agricultural loan portfolio of 4 branches each of the People's Bank and the Bank of Ceylon, one Co-operative Rural Bank and Regional Rural Development Bank. The reports of inspection carried out were' forwarded

to the head offices of the respective banks and their branch offices for rectifying the deficiencies that were highlighted in the reports.

The Bank introduced the Inland Bill Scheme during the fust half of 1989 to popularise a new instrument in the domestic market for financing the working capital requirements of the Bought Leaf Factories and solving the problem of inadequacy of short-term capital requirements. The two banks, viz., the Bank of Ceylon and the People's bank each have identified five factories for implementation of this scheme. The two state plantation organisations, viz., Janatha Estate Development Board and the State Plantation Corporation, have expressed their willingness to implement this Scheme. An advertising campaign on the radio and in newspapers has been initiated to popularise this scheme and it is expected to produce positive results in the future.

The Rural Credit Advisory Board of the Bank held five meetings during 1989. During these meetings, the Board discussed some vital issues such as unrecovered bank loans, the Revolving Credit Scheme, the introduction of Inland Bill Scheme and the proposal to make the Board a statutory body. The Board arrived at important decisions in regard to recovery of unrecovered loans and the proposal to make the Board a statutory body so that it could play a more effective role by enforcing its decisions. Accordingly, moves are under way to implement these decisions.

REGIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS (RRDBs)

Expansion of Branch Network

As at the end of 1989,there were 11 RRDBs in the island with a network of 89 branches. During the year, only 9 RRDB branches were opened and the slow rate of branch expansion was the result of the unsettled conditions that prevailed in the country during 1989. Table 2.8 shows the branch expansion of RRDBs from 1985 to the end of 1989.

Deposit Mobilisation

A considerable progress was made by RRDBs in the mobilisation of deposits in 1988, and this trend continued in 1989. According to the estimated data, total deposits mobilised by all RRDBs rose from Rs. 108 million on 144,552 accounts as at the end of 1988 to Rs. 172 million on 199,519 accounts as at the end of 1989. Approximately 84 per cent of the total deposits was accounted for by the ordinary savings accounts, while the balance by fixed deposits. This indicated that the RRDBs continued to serve mainly the relatively poor segments in rural areas. The average deposit per account (both savings and fixed) increased from Rs. 744 million in 1988 to Rs. 863 million in 1989. Detailed data on deposits mobilisation are presented in Table 2.9

RRDBs introduced several new deposit schemes to mobilize savings in the rural areas. Development Deposit Scheme! Group Deposit Scheme and Minor/School Children Savings Deposit Scheme were the most popular among them. Development Deposit Scheme and Group Deposit Scheme were especially designed to help the future borrowers of the RRDBs to familiarise themselves with banking transactions and to judge their savings capacity in relation to their current income. The objective of Minor/School Children Savings Deposit Scheme was solely to inculcate savings habit among them. The scheme has become very popular among rural parents who have an innate liking to save for the future of their children.

Loan Operations

Details on loans disbursed from 1985 to 1989 by each RRDB are given in Table 2.10. The value of loans disbursed increased from Rs. 113 million in 1988 to Rs. 155 million in 1989. At the same time the total number of loans approved rose from 17,657 in 1988 to 20,720in 1989. The average size of a loan which stood at Rs. 6386 in 1988 rose to Rs. 7,463 in 1989 indicating a marginal increase.

It is evident from the size of the loans disbursed by RRDBs that they have advanced loans mostly to small-scale borrowers. Moreover, creation of self-employment opportunities among rural unemployed youth continued to be an important objective of RRDBs. The RRDBs are required to identify economic activities which can be managed by a small borrower, provide timely credit and ensure proper utilisation of such credit which would increase borrowers' income.

In keeping with the above objectives, RRDBs have provided loans for a wide spectrum of activities including agricultural operations, livestock activities, fisheries, garment making, packeting of tea and food items, manufacture of bricks and retail trade etc.

Table 2.11 reveals that the RRDBs have assigned a high priority to agriculture. Accordingly, loan disbursements in respect of agriculture amounted to Rs. 87 million (56 per cent of total loans) during 1989. Loans disbursed in respect of small industries and commerce and business accounted for 11 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively.

Other Activities

Deviating from traditional commercial banks, the RRDBs have introduced certain innovative banking practices. One such scheme is the 'Group Lending System' where loans are granted to members of a group which consists of 5 to 6 people who are like minded and have similar socio-economic status. On the first occasion, loans are given to two members of the group and on the performance of these two members, others will also be considered for granting of loans. The group savings account provide sufficient collateral in addition to collective responsibility of a group towards the repayment of loans to the bank.

' Janahamuwa' is another popular method by which RRDBs communicate with the rural r sector. This is more in the nature of a mobile bank where the RRDBs explain to the rural community, the credit facilities and other services offered by them. 'Janahamuwa' provides the rural people the opportunity to express their needs, problems, skills, and capabilities. Such meetings provide them with the motivation to start viable projects. Accepting deposits, repayment of loan instalments and transactions concerning loan applications may also take place at the 'Janahamuwa'.

RURAL BANKINGS AND STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

Rural Banking and Staff Training College (RB & STC) of the Bank continued to expand its training activities in 1989. During the year, RB & STC conducted 39 training courses for 853 persons engaged in banking, banking operations and related fields to update their knowledge, enhance skills and change attitudes so as to enable them to discharge their duties efficiently. Of these participants, 250 were from commercial banks, 78 from RRDBs and 288 from the Central Bank. The remaining 237 participants were officials of the government departments/agencies and small-scale entrepreneurs.

RB & STC training programmes included courses on commercial banking, rural banking, project-oriented development (i.e., small-scale agriculture and animal husbandry), export promotion, hire purchase and lease financing, management development, computer training and entrepreneur development In response to special requests made by other government departments and organisations, RB & STC conducted special training courses. These included the courses conducted in collaboration with United States Agency for the International Development (US AID) on 'Statistical Methods and Techniques', International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) on "Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project" and the course on "Central Banking and Commercial Banking" for the benefit of the commerce teachers of the Education Department

In response to the rising demand for 'human resource development', RB & STC started publishing. training reports on selected training courses, These reports were expected to provide necessary guidelines to the emerging trainers, and training organisations/institutes to conduct training courses more efficiently. To further complement its promotional role in training, RB & STC started a series of bi-annual publications, the first of which was on 'Promotion of Small-scale Industries*.

. During 1989, the Anuradhapura Regional Office recommended 297 projects valued at Rs. 4.3 million. All projects recommended to the banks by this Regional Office during 1989 were under the self-employment and village adoption loan schemes. The activities under the other refinance loan schemes were severely restricted by the unsettled conditions in the area. (Table 2.14)

The Matale Regional Office recorded a considerable progress in the activities under the self-employment and livestock development refinance loan schemes during 1989. Under the self-employment and village adoption loan scheme, it recommended 259 projects valued at Rs. 2.9 million.

Regional cheque clearing among commercial banks in the three regions was also handled by the Regional Offices. The Matara Regional Office cleared 76,144 cheques to the value of Rs. 1,229.3 million, while Matale Regional Office cleared 272,032 cheques to the value of Rs. 4,660.2 million in 1989. The Anuradhapura Regional Office cleared cheques valued at Rs. 316.2 million during the year 1989.

SRI LANKA AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE

The Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House (SLACH) which commenced operations on March 2,1988 continued its operations according to schedule during the year 1989.

With more banks computerising, enhancing of courier services and many banks in the city opting to increase banking hours upto 3.30 p.m. customers were able to obtain more benefits due to automation. All cheques received upto 3 3 0 p.m. in the city banks/branches are sent to the Clearing House on the same day and are processed and returned to the drawee banks by 6.00 a m . the following day.

With the widening of courier services, significant changes were observed in the clearing time schedule, especially in the outstation branches. Around 10 branches came in from a 2 day clearing to 1 day clearing, 30 branches came in from a 7 day clearing to a 2 day clearing and 174 branches from a 7 day clearing to a 5 day clearing.

Computerised banks continued to gain advantages from the automation of cheque clearing. On request from the People's Bank and the Bank of Ceylon their branch summary data were provided on magnetic media. This enables them to load the clearing data for their branches directly on to their computer system. Some banks which have the account number encoded on the cheque are beingprovided their inward items sorted down to account number, serial number level. The number of branches obtaining data on diskettes also increased during the year under review.

MANAGEMENT AUDIT

During 1989, the Management Audit Department of the Bank, in accordance with its programme, carried out its audit functions in respect of activities of various departments of the Bank particularly the Secretariat, Premises, Welfare, Banking, Currency, Rural Banking and Staff Training College and three regional offices at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale. In the course of audit, more emphasis was paid to highlight shortcomings relating to compliance with the procedures laid down in the Bank rules and regulations than in checking the arithmetical accuracy of accounts.

In 1989, the Department entered into new areas of activities such as the auditing of printing and supply of currency notes to the Central Bank, checking and verification of assets of finance companies whose activities have been taken over by the Central Bank, checking of purchase and delivery of items required by the Central Bank.

SURVEYS AND DATA COLLECTION

Social Accounts

In view of the importance of improving the estimates of National Accounts in Sri Lanka which have been traditionally based on the value-added approach by industries, action was taken by the Bank to compute the GDP/GNP using the sectoral approach, i.e., Business Sector, Household Sector, Government and Foreign Sector and to expand the GDP estima­tion procedure to include income estimates as well. Also, apart from collecting data from secondary sources, the Bank started collecting data from primary sources as well.

Furthermore, the Bank commenced work to develop the capital stock estimates in Sri Lanka. Data from 1975 to 1988 on import of capital goods were collected during 1989, while the work relating to estimating the Capital Stock is to commence in 1990.
