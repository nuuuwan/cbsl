The Central Bank continued to refund 4 percentage points per annum of the interest charged on the export credit refinance so that the lending banks could pass the benefit on to the customers on export transactions, provided the sale proceeds are received in Sri Lanka within 90 days. The global limit of refinance remained at Rs. 1,663 million under Category I of the Export Credit Refinance Facility. However, a further sum of Rs. 400 million was made available with effect from November 16,1989, as a temporary measure, to overcome the liquidity needs of the tea sector whose production, export and realisation of proceeds, were disrupted. This was withdrawn on December 15,1989. There was no limit of refinance under Category II except in the case of tea-bags and calibrated precious stones.",

There was no failure of finance companies in 1989 as against 7 failures in the previous year in spite of the highly unfavourable economic conditions that prevailed in the year. The month long strike in the transport sector during June - July adversely affected the liquidity position of finance companies, since the private sector operated public transport service is largely financed by them. However, the finance companies managed to lwade through the difficult situation. Moreover, except three small companies which were in difficulties in 1988 also, all other finance companies that experienced difficulties in 1987 and 1988 managed to improve their performance considerably in 1989 with the technical and managerial assistance of the Central Bank. Two finance companies were given financial assistance through the refinance facility of the Central Bank.",

The relief payment was extended to deposits in respect of the principal sum deposited and maturing as at December 31,1989. Under this scheme, a sum of Rs. 20,000/-or SO per cent of the matured deposit, whichever is less, was to be made to depositors exclusive of any accrued interest and subject to deductions from the sum paid of loans and other dues to the finance companies. During 1989, the Board decided to grant further relief to depositors to the full extent of the principal sum, where a deposit does not exceed Rs. 10,000/-.

A major portion of these approvals amounting to Rs. 298.0 million was by way of assistance to sick industries, which included capitalisation of interest in arrears on loans granted to 27 tourist hotels. Despite the unsettled conditions in the country, the approval of refinance for setting-up new projects and expansion of existing projects under Categories II, III and IV amounted to Rs. 142.0 million in 1989, an increase of Rs. 63.0 million over previous year's approvals. Of this, the refinance approvals to export-oriented projects certified by the Export Development Board amounted to Rs. 32.0 million. However, the refinance approvals in 1989to agriculture in respect of loans granted to meet the domestic cost of the Medium-Term Investment Programme (MTIP) for die plantation sector was only Rs. 9.0 million compared to the previous year's approval of Rs. 43.0 million. This, was mainly due to near exhaustion of Rs. 260.0 million (US$ 10.0 million) approved for the purpose. A breakdown of medium and long-term refinance approvals is given in Table 2.4",

The two state plantation organisations, viz., Janatha Estate Development Board and the State Plantation Corporation, have expressed their willingness to implement this Scheme.

According to the estimated data, total deposits mobilised by all RRDBs rose from Rs. 108 million on 144,552 accounts as at the end of 1988 to Rs. 172 million on 199,519 accounts as at the end of 1989. Approximately 84 per cent of the total deposits was accounted for by the ordinary savings accounts, while the balance by fixed deposits. This indicated that the RRDBs continued to serve mainly the relatively poor segments in rural areas. The average deposit per account (both savings and fixed) increased from Rs. 744 million in 1988 to Rs. 863 million in 1989. Detailed data on deposits mobilisation are presented in Table 2.9",
