The Colombo Consumers' Price Index recorded an annual average increase of 11.6 per cent in 1989 compared to 14.0 per cent in 1988. However, this deceleration in the rate of increase in prices was mainly concentrated in the first few months of the year. The second half of 1989 was characterised by a sharp rise in prices. The point to point increase in the Index at the end of the year (December 1989 over December 1988) was 15.1 per cent compared to a rise of 10.1 per cent in the period January 1989 over January 1988. At the primary market level too, deceleration in the rate of increase in prices was clearly discernible with the annual average of the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rising by only 9.0 per cent compared to 17.8 per cent in 1988.",

Drought conditions, revision in the price of wheat flour and bread which are substitutes to rice and the disruption in production, trade and transport pushed the price of rice to very high levels. The price of bread and wheat flour which had remained unchanged since 1985 were revised upward on a number of occasions with a view to eventually eliminating the subsidy on them. Prices of sugar and milk powder also rose consequent to the depreciation of the exchange rate and increase in foreign prices. Sharp price increases were also recorded in respect of meat, eggs, pulses and dried chillies. Due to improved production, prices of coconuts and coconut oil dropped sharply during the year which helped to partly offset the sharp price increases recorded in other items. The prices of petrol and auto diesel which had remained unchanged since 1984 were revised twice during the year, and this had an additional indirect impact on the price increases of other items.",

    "text": "Table 1.36 gives provisional information for 1989 for selected key activities in the unorganised sector. In paddy cultivation nominal wages were observed to have risen by between 5 to 14 per cent for the activities considered. However, real wages dropped for most activities except ploughing and transplanting (female), both of which recorded a marginal improvement in real wages when compared to the previous year. In coconut small holdings, wages for plucking grew sharply in 1989 with real wages improving substantially. In rubber cultivation, the rate of growth in nominal wages in 1989 was somewhat slower to that of 1988. Real wages for tapping deteriorated, while real wages for manuring improved moderately. Female wages in tea cultivation which grew substantially in 1988 continued to grow at a comparable rate in 1989. Real wages for these workers continued to improve. It is noteworthy that in the unorganised sector, building construction activities, nominal wages grew at a significantly higher rate than in 1988. Real wages improved for all categories of workers in building construction, in contrast to the previous year when a deterioration in real wage levels was observed in these activities.",

Receipient families under these programmes were directly linked to a training cum production programme through which they were expected to offer a minimum of 24 days of labour per month on productive activities. An important feature of these programmes was that the entire public sector including corporations adopted poverty alleviation as an important component in providing new employment. Credit facilities provided by various loan schemes introduced by state banks too were geared towards increasing self employment opportunities during 1989. The demand for skilled and unskilled labour by foreign countries showed a substantial increase as reflected in a 20 per cent rise in foreign job order approvals by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment.",
