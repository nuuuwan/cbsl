    "text": "Enhanced hydro-electricity generation following favourable weather conditions and restricted demand for energy due to civil disturbances were the salient features of the developments in the domestic energy sector in 1989. The two together resulted in a substantial reduction in the use of petroleum products for energy generation, thereby easing the burden on the balance of payments. The transport sector suffered a severe set-back owing to continuing civil disturbances, the run-down state of the vehicle fleet and the high cost of vehicle and spare parts. Postal and Telecommunication services too suffered due to civil disturbances. In the area of social overheads, almost all activities related to housing, health and education showed slow progress in 1989.",

    "text": "In 1989, the favourable weather conditions that prevailed during most of the year had a positive impact on the domestic energy sector. The improved water levels in the reservoirs resulted in an enhancement of hydro-electricity generation. On the other hand, the demand for electricity declined due to civil disturbances in the country. These developments on both the supply and demand sides enabled the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to meet a major part of the country's electricity demand from hydro power, thereby reducing the thermal power generation to a bare minimum. Higher oil prices in the international market and the sharp price adjustments in the domestic market contributed to a substantial decline in the demand for petroleum products during the year.",

As the water levels of the reservoirs improved, the hydro-power plants were able to operate at full capacity. As a result, the relative share of electricity generated by hydro sources increased to 98 per cent in 1989, from 93 per cent in 1988. This was also reflected in the share of hydro-based power in commercial energy which increased to 47 per cent in 1989 from 44 per cent in 1988. Correspondingly, the thermal power generation declined considerably from 202 million kWh in 1988 to 56 million kWh in 1989, thereby lowering the overall cost of electricity generation. Meanwhile, generation and transmission losses increased to 500 million kWh in 1989 or 17 per cent of the total generation as compared with 16 per cent in 1988. This was largely due to the damages caused to transformers and transmission lines following the escalation of civil disturbances during the period June to October, 1989.",

Similarly, the total volume of crude oil imports declined substantially by 33 per cent to 1,275,059 metric tons in 1989, an additional factor being the closure of the oil refinery from 15th July, 1989 to 15th September, 1989. In contrast, imports of refined products increased from 143,079 metric tons in 1988 to 374,344 metric tons in 1989.",

Substantial decreases were recorded in the use of heavy diesel (64 per cent), super diesel (14 per cent) and furnace oil (9 per cent). Consumption of kerosene and auto-diesel too declined by 2 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively in 1989. Consumption of super petrol, however, recorded an increase of 9 per cent over 1988 due to increased imports of private cars and motorcycles.

Although a total of 212 new buses were added to the existing fleet of7,097 during the year, this was inadequate to sufficiently revamp the fleet, in view of the destruction and damage caused to the vehicle fleet.

    "text": "Compared with other modes of transport activities, the Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) fared better during the year under review. Even during the days of unrest and turmoil, skeleton passenger services and goods trains operated to serve the needs of the country. Consequently, the operated kilometerage of the SLR remained unchanged at 6.6 million in 1989. Meanwhile, passenger kilometerage and freight ton kilometerage declined by 10 per cent each to 1,677 million and 178 million, respectively during the year. These depressed levels were largely due to intermittent suspension and cancellation of scheduled services during July to October, 1989 as a result of the civil disturbances. Accordingly, revenue of the SLR declined by 16 per cent to Rs. 392 million during the year. Shortfalls in the railway revenue were mainly recorded during the months of July, August and September, 1989. As against a total expenditure of Rs. 795 million, the operated losses of the SLR stood at Rs. 403 million in 1989, as compared with Rs. 479 million in 1988.",

About 65 buses belonging to the private sector were destroyed during the disturbances in 1989. Reduced level of revenue due to restricted services and increasing expenditure on vehicles and spare parts had an adverse impact on the profitability of the industry. Consequently, the number of new permits issued by the Department of Private Omnibus Transport to operators declined sharply to 225 in 1989 from 1,854 in 1988. The records of the Department of Motor Traffic also indicated a considerable drop in the number of new registrations of private coaches. The number of new registration of motor coaches declined to 444 in 1989 compared with 863 in 1988.",

However, the final aim of the programme is to alleviate poverty among all sections of the population. Under the MHP, the beneficiaries themselves were given the discretion of building a house of their own choice. The village re-awakening concept has instilled in the people the strength to build houses through their creativity, self-reliance and community participation. This programme has taken the form of model villages, re-awakened villages and urban housing projects in its implementation. These schemes are provided with all basic amenities such as roads, water, electricity and health-care services.",
