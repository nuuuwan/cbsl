    "text": "A significant deceleration in the rate of growth of money supply mainly resulting from a substantial moderation in the expansion of domestic credit was the notable feature of monetary developments in 1989. The annual rate of growth of narrow money supply (Mi), comprising currency and demand deposits held by the public, which was 29 per cent at the end of 1988, decreased to 9 percent by the end of 1989. Following a similar trend, the annual rate of growth of broad money supply (M2), consisting of Mi plus time and savings deposits held by the public with commercial banks, declined from 16 per cent to 12 per cent over the same period.",

    "text": "These developments were commendable, when viewed in the context of the stabilisation programme implemented during the year, following serious macro-economic de-stabilisa\u00adtion that occurred in 1988. The year 1988 ended with a sharp acceleration in the rate of monetary expansion. After a slight moderation during the first two months of 1989, this trend re - appeared once again after March. This monetary expansion resulted solely from a sharp expansion of domestic credit in favour of both the Government and private sectors since external assets of the banking system were on a declining trend with some minor fluctuations. Consequently, to cope with the situation, the Central Bank had to strengthen the contractionary monetary policy stance after May, 1989 with some additional policy measures. This stringent monetary policy was supported by significant improvements in fiscal performance through improved cash management by the Treasury and rationalisation of expenditure. These policy stances were augmented by an aggressive open market operation policy aimed at diverting Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills into the non-bank sector. The policy changes had very favourable results and the rate of monetary expansion decelerated substantially by the end of year. Consequently, the growth rates in monetary and credit aggregates in 1989 were broadly in line with the targets set for the year under the stabilization programme.",

    "text": "In 1989, the narrow money supply (Mi) rose by only Rs. 2,959 million compared with an increase of Rs. 7,296 million in 1988. The growth in Mi in 1989 was mainly reflected in the demand deposit component which rose by Rs. 1,796 million or 13 percent In comparison, the currency holdings of the public rose by only Rs. 1, 163 million or 6 per cent, thereby reducing its share in Mi from 57.1 per cent in December 1988 to 55.6 per cent in December 1989. Meanwhile, quasi-money which recorded a slower growth of Rs. 2,315 million or 7 per cent in 1988 increased by a substantial margin of Rs. 5,528 million or 16 per cent in 1989. This was fully reflected in time and savings deposits of otherprivate sectorconstituents which grew by Rs. 6,249 million or 21 per cent Similarly, the time and savings deposits of co-operative institutions too rose by Rs. 152 million, in contrast to a decrease of Rs. 27 million recorded during 1988. Meanwhile, deposits of government corporations dropped by Rs. 873 million or 17 per cent Consequent to the increase in time and savings deposits, the broad money supply (M2) expanded by Rs. 8,487 million or 12 per cent in 1989 compared with a rise of Rs. 9,611 million or 16percentin 1988. The decline in the relative position of currency component in monetary aggregates together with increases in demand deposits and quasi-money reflected a reduction in the preference of the public to hold liquid assets following the improved security conditions in the country, particularly during the last quarter of 1989.",

During the year, domestic credit expanded by Rs. 5,454 million or 6 per cent. Comparable growth in the previous year was Rs. 21,302 million or 28 per cent. Both the government sector and the private sector recorded lower increases in credit utilization as compared with the last year. In sharp contrast to the experience in the previous year when net credit to Government (NCG) from the banking system increased by Rs. 9,017 million or 33 per cent, during 1989 such credit expanded by a mere Rs. 54 million. Meanwhile, gross credit to the private sector (GCPS) also grew by only Rs. 5,400 million or 9 per cent during 1989, compared with an increase of Rs. 12,285 million or 25 per cent in the previous year.",

    "text": "The government's recourse to bank credit dropped precipitately during the year. Although the borrowing requirement of the government was high, the aggressive open market opera\u00adtions by the Central Bank were successful in diverting a significant proportion of the Treasury bills held by the banking system to the non-banking sector. Accordingly, gross credit to government from the banking system rose only by Rs. 429 million during 1989, as compared with an increase of Rs. 12,792 million in 1988. This, together with a deposit build-up of Rs. 375 million, depressed the net recourse to the banking system on the part of the government to a mere Rs. 54 million. This was a salutary development from the point of view of achieving stabilisation objectives and containing inflationary pressures in the economy.",

    "text": "Meanwhile, commercial bank credit to government corporations expanded by Rs. 3,075 million or 29 per cent in 1989. This increase was largely due to a higher demand for credit for meeting working capital requirements of some corporations where the cash flows had been disrupted by insurgent activities, and the enhanced role of the C.W.E. as an importer of essential foodstuffs following the transfer of food import responsibilities from the Food Commissioner to the C.W.E. During 1989, advances to the C.W.E. rose by Rs. 1,269 million, while those to the two state plantation corporations increased by Rs. 1,189 million.

However, during 1989 the net foreign assets (NFA) position showed marked fluctuations. The NFA of the banking system declined drastically from Rs. 7,058 million in December, 1988 to Rs. 976 million in August, 1989, but turned around thereafter rising to Rs. 4,732 million by the end of 1989.",

The -raising of the Bank Rate to 14 per cent, the imposition of a 100 per cent margin requirement against Letters of Credit in respect of luxury items and the ceiling on credit facilities to non-priority sectors were among the new measures introduced by die Central Bank to restrain credit expansion and to conserve foreign exchange reserves. These measures resulted in tight liquidity within the banking system as evidenced by the marked increase in domestic inter-bank borrowings during the third quarter of 1989. The situation may have been exacerbated by the delayed repatriation of export proceeds by the exporters seeking to benefit from a progressively depreciating exchange rate at that time and die practice on die part of some commercial banks to bold unduly large working balances abroad, against to gain from exchange rate depreciation, and because of the unsettled condition.",

Because of the encouragement of competition, commercial banks continued to improve the quality of customer services through the introduction of new instruments, computerisation of banking operations, extension of banking hours and intensification of manpower develop\u00adment programmes.",

On the liabilities side, the item \"other liabilities\" continued at the high level it had reached in 1988, primarily on account of recording delays arising from disruption to banking services in some areas of the country. This was reflected in a continuing high level in the suspense accounts on account of cheques sent for collection, in the two state sector banks. Meanwhile, deposits rose by 16 per cent (Rs. 9,855 million) consisting of an increase of 16 per cent (Rs. 6,729 million) in time and savings deposits and 17 percent (Rs. 3,126 million) in demand deposits.

Compared with the previous year, the share of short-term advances in total advances increased from 67 per cent at the end of 1988 to 71 per cent by the third quarter of 1989.

Meanwhile the net utilisation of commercial banks' resources by government corporations amounted to Rs. 3,622 million. During the year under review, the government sector was a net source of resources to commercial banks to the tune of Rs. 1,000 million, compared with net utilisations of commercial bank resources in the immediately preceding two years. The build-up of government deposits by Rs. 1,297million and the repayment of short-term credits amounting to Rs. 1,035 million were primarily responsible for the resources surplus generated by the government sector to commercial banks.",

The grant of financial facilities for medium and long term investment covering a wide range of rural based economic activities in agriculture and allied fields, were supported through 25 credit schemes in operation during 1989. In addition, 3 new special projects, including a project directed towards alleviating rural poverty, came into operation during the year under review. With a view to improving the institutional arrangements for meeting the credit needs of the rural sector, the Central Bank extended the period of operation of several credit schemes which were scheduled to terminate during the year and also increased the number of participating institutions under several other credit schemes.",

The decline in the area under insurance during 1989 was mainly due to the decline in the area financed by the banking system. The performance of the AIB closely follow the performance of the banking system in regard to agricultural lending. Meanwhile, keeping in line with the reduced area insured, the total value of premia collected amounted to Rs. 9.3 million in 1989 a decline of 40 per cent over the previous year. The value of indemnity paid by the AIB during 1989 was Rs. 9.9 million, the lowest amount recorded since 1983.

Following the trend observed in the previous year, the total deposits of the finance companies declined further by 7 per cent to Rs. 5,057 million at the end of third quarter, 1989. This may have been due to attractive interest rates offered in the Treasury bills market and the lack of confidence on the part of the public in finance companies in general. Meanwhile, the borrowings from commercial banks, shareholders, directors, etc. dropped by 31 percent Other liabilities including sundry creditors, unclaimed dividends, accrued interest and provisions for taxation, ect dropped from Rs. 1,699 million in 1988 to Rs. 666 million in the second quarter, 1989 but increased sharply to Rs. 1,585 million at the end of the third quarter.

Continuing inflationary pressures and the high demand for funds by the government for budgetary purposes, led these rates to remain relatively high though there was a tendency for a downward movement between the first and second quarters of 1989. The weighted average yield on 12-months Treasury bills rose from 18.8 per cent per annum at the end of June, 1989 to 19.1 per cent by the end of the year, while the weighted average yield on 3-months bills declined from 19.8 per cent per annum to 18.1 per cent over the same period. The interest rates in the secondary market for Treasury bills responded to variations in rates in the primary market, though the end-year rates in this market were slightly lower than that at the end ofj.988. Whereas the discount and rediscount rates at the end of 1988 were 18 and 23 per cent per annum, respectively, by the end of 1989, they were 15.5 and 20.5 per cent per annum.",

In the final quarter of 1989, call money rates stabilised at levels lower than those at the beginning of the year, ending the year at a range between 13 and 25 per cent per annum. Under the impact of the increase in the Bank Rate by 4 percentage points to 14 per cent per annum in June 1989 and the high yields available in the Treasury bill market, the commercial banks' deposit rates tended to rise in 1989. The minimum and maximum rates on twelve-month deposits increased from a range of 9 to 15.5 per cent per annum at the end of 1988 to a range of 11 to 20.5 per cent per annum by the end of December, 1989.",

Discount and re-discount rates in this market were adjusted to reflect the movement of yields in the primary Treasury bill market Discount rates varied in a range of 11.5 - 18.0 per cent while re-discount rates varied in a range of 16.5 - 23.0 per cent, during the year. A lower discount rate in this market than the primary market rate was maintained to improve the biddings in the primary Treasury bill market, while a higher re-discount rate was used to discourage sales by non-Central Bank holders to the Central Bank in this market. The gross sales in the secondary Treasury bill market rose by 15.4 per cent during the year as compared with the previous year. As a consequence of these changes, the holdings of Treasury bills by the non-bank sector more than doubled, from Rs. 6.6 billion at the end of 1988 to Rs. 15.5 billion at the end of 1989. This improvement helped to restrict the value of fresh Treasury bills that had to be held by the banking sector. Meanwhile, the share of holdings of Treasury bills by the Central bank reduced from 73 per cent at the end of 1988 to 57 per cent at the end of 1989.",

Secondly, the introduction of Treasury bills with 6-months and 12-months maturity period provided abetterportfolio option to investors. Thirdly, the sale of Treasury bills under the 'tap system' which further expanded its coverage in 1989, provided an easy access to the Treasury bill market for investors in outer-regions, as well as in Colombo.

As in the previous year, the commercial banking sector was the main category which increased its resources within the resident category. This was largely due to the increase in non-resident and resident non-national foreign currency (NRFC and RNNFC) deposits invested with FCBUs by commercial banks.
