The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in real terms is estimated to have risen by 2.3 per cent compared with a growth of 2.7 per cent in 1988. Following the same trend, the Gross National Product (GNP), which is derived by allowing for the flow of net factor income abroad, showed a growth of 2.2 per cent compared with the real GNP growth rate of 2.6 per cent recorded in the previous year.",

However, given the strains under which the economy had to function in 1989, viz, sporadic civil disturbances and orchestrated work stoppages which not only affected economic activity but also undermined business confidence, and the adverse weather which seriously affected agricul\u00adtural production, the growth performance can be considered very satisfactory. It reflects the capacity of the economy to withstand extreme pressures and yet generate positive results provided right policies and correct incentives are in place.",

The Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF), inclusive of changes in stocks, recorded an increase of 8 per cent in 1989, compared with a rise of 10 per cent in 1988. Consequently, the ratio of GDCF to GDP at market prices declined from 22.8 per cent in 1988 to 21.7 per cent in 1989. Contrary to the general pattern in recent years, in 1989 the larger contribution to capital formation came from the private sector. The combined capital formation of the private sector and public corporations increased by 16 per cent as compared with a rise of 7.8 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile, the GDCF of the Government decreased by 14.5 per cent over the previous year due to a curtailment of government capital expenditure.",

The value added in tea and rubber declined by 8.8 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively in 1989. In the paddy sector, the overall output declined by 16.7 per cent as compared with an increase of 16.4 per cent in 1988. However, the coconut sector showed considerable resilience in 1989 and output increased by 28 per cent due to the lagged effect of favourable weather conditions that prevailed in 1988. Meanwhile, the value added in the 'other agriculture' sub-sector which includes forestry and fishing, grew by 2.3 per cent in 1989, as against a 0.2 per cent decline in the previous year. Overall, as the agriculture sector contributes about 24 per cent to the GDP, the decline in the value added of this sector had a major impact on the overall economic performance in 1989.",

The entirety of this growth originated in the private sector, demonstrating its capacity to operate under extreme pressures. Meanwhile, the value added in the Services Sector increased by 3.2 per cent in 1989. Within this sector, banking and insurance, trade, and public administration and defence recorded relatively high growth. However, the value added in electricity, gas, water and sanitary services increased by only 1.8 per cent, as compared with 3.5 per cent growth in the previous year.

Accordingly, the value of industrial output which grew by 6 percent in real terms in 1988, increased by a further 6 per cent in 1989. However, the growth originated entirely in the private sector industry, demonstrating its resilience and capacity to withstand pressures of any nature. The output of private sector industry rose by 15 per cent in 1989. In contrast, the public sector tended to succumb easily to the pressures arising from civil disturbances and its output declined sharply by 21 per cent during the year.

    "text": "With these developments, the country's export composition underwent further change in 1989. The most noteworthy change was the rise in the share of industrial exports from 48 per cent in 1988 to 51 per cent in 1989, thus pushing the share of industrial exports in total exports above the 50 per cent level. Meanwhile, the share of agricultural exports declined further from 43 per cent to 39 per cent between the two years. The share of mineral exports also fell from 5.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent. Textile and garments continued to be the single major category of exports \u2022 a position reached in 1986 - accounting for 31 per cent of the total exports in 1989. The comparable share in 1988 was 30 per cent.",

The increase was wholly reflected in the imports of consumer and intermediate goods. In contrast, investment goods imports declined by 8 per cent in 1989. The expenditure on imports of consumer goods rose somewhat sharply by 11 per cent, from SDR 408 million (Rs. 17,438 million) in 1988 to SDR 454 million (Rs.20,962 million) in 1989, largely owing to increased outlays on rice and sugar imports. The expenditure on rice imports rose sharply by 74 per cent to SDR 74 million, while that on sugar imports increased by 37 per cent to SDR 94 million. The increased outlay on rice imports was due to both the volume (50 per cent) and price (16 per cent) increases. The expenditure on sugar imports rose wholly due to a price increase.",

    "text": "In 1989, Sri Lanka's balance of payments developments turned but to be significantly less unfavourable than what was originally anticipated. Whereas in terms of the mid year forecast the overall deficit was expected to be around SDR 170 million, the year ended with an overall deficit of only SDR 67 million. During the first half of 1989, there was intense pressure on the balance of payments with considerable loss of reserves. However, a sharp turn-around was observed during the second half, particularly since September, following the restoration of confidence in the economy in the wake of the implementation of economic stabilisation measures and the improvement in the security situation. The gross official reserves which had declined to SDR 125 million at the end of June, 1989 reached SDR 224 million by the end of the year. Similarly, total gross reserves rose from SDR 385 million at the end of June to SDR 447 at the end of December, 1989. This recovery in the balance of payments position was one of the.most encouraging features of Sri Lanka's economic performance in 1989.",

Foreign exchange earnings from travel and allied services increased from a deficit of SDR 2 million in 1988 to a surplus of SDR 3 million in 1989. This was mainly due to a significant increase in tourist arrivals during the closing months of 1989 following an improvement in the security situation. Meanwhile, the net outflow on account of investment income in 1989 at SDR 128 million was somewhat higher than in the previous year, the major reason being the reduced interest income from foreign portfolio investments by the Central Bank. As in previous years, the interest payments on foreign loans, at SDR 161 million, accounted for a major share of total service payments amounting to SDR 418 million.",

This was very largely due to a sharp reduction in official transfers which dropped by 12 per cent to SDR 136 million in 1989. In comparison, foreign exchange receipts from private transfers consisting mainly of remittances by Sri Lankans working abroad at SDR 263 million were only marginally lower than in 1988.",

    "text": "Meanwhile, the developments in the capital account of the balance of payments in 1989 were less favourable than in 1988. Although net monetary capital inflows in 1989 at SDR 252 million reflected an increase of 30 per cent over the previous year, the increase was almost entirely due to the enhanced utilisation of trade credits and a commercial loan from USA for the financing of wheat imports. On the other hand, direct investments declined by 34 per cent to SDR 21 million, while there was a net outflow of SDR 23 million on account of private long term loans. While a larger volume of resources came from private short-term sources, there was an 8 per cent reduction in net official capital inflows, from SDR 182 million in 1988 to SDR 167 million in 1989, which was almost entirely due to a 12 per cent reduction in disbursements under project loans. As the resources available from non\u00admonetary capital flows were lower than the current account deficit, the balance had to be financed by monetary movements. The deficit that had to be so financed was SDR 67 million in 1989. Sri Lanka's gross external assets stood at SDR 447 million (Rs. 23,389 million) at the end of 1989 reflecting an improvement over the previous year's level of SDR 428 million (Rs. 19,025 million). However, the net external assets position deteriorated between the two years reflecting the overall deficit in the balance of payments referred to above.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka's total outstanding external debt stood at SDR 3,960 million at the end of 1989 recording an increase of 7 per cent over the previous year, t h e medium and long-term debt continued to account for over 90 per cent of the total outstanding external debt. However, the short-term debt rose significantly in 1989 due to considerable increases in both short-term borrowings by the Central Bank and increased utilisation of trade credits. Meanwhile, there was a 10 per cent increase in the indebtedness to the IMF in 1989, mainly due to the drawing of SDR 67 million under the SAF. The debt service payments, consisting of amortization payments on medium and long-term loans and interest payments on all foreign loans, decreased by SDR 32 million to SDR 371 million in 1989. Total debt service payments as a ratio of earnings from exports of goods and services decreased from 28.7 per cent in 1988 to 24.4 per cent in 1989. This ratio, excluding IMF transactions, was 19.9 per cent as compared with 22.8 per cent in the previous year.",

The overall budget deficit was-contained at Rs. 25,091 million or 10.0 per cent of GDP as compared with a targetted deficit of 12.5 per cent of GDP and the previous year's deficit of 15.6 per cent. The improvement was a combined effect of both increased revenue and reduced expenditure. The government revenue/GDP ratio was more or less at the targetted level of 21.3 per cent. Meanwhile, there was a substantial reduction in government outlays which enabled total expenditure as a proportion of GDP to be reduced to 31.6 per cent, as against 33.8 per cent originally targetted. The larger share of the reduction in government expenditure was reflected in capital votes. Following these developments, the budget deficit as a ratio of GDP which was 15.6 per cent in 1988 declined to 10.0 per cent in 1989. Apart from the reduction in the budget deficit, there were also favourable trends in financing the deficit, in that resources available from non-expansionary sources were sufficient to finance the deficit in full, thereby totally eliminating the need for resorting to expansionary financing.",

Consequently, the share of the currency component in M1 declined from 57 per cent in 1988 to 56 per cent in 1989.

During the last few years, the Central Bank Annual Reports had been repeatedly drawing the attention of the Government to the need for fiscal restraint as its continued heavy borrowings from the banking system constituted the major underlying factor for the excessive liquidity creation in the economy exerting heavy pressure on the money supply, prices and the balance of payments.",

The enhanced role of the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (C.

Meanwhile, the Central Bank pursued a restrictive monetary policy stance to curb excessive credit creation and ease pressure on the balance of payments. These developments resulted in tight liquidity condi\u00adtions within the banking system as evidenced by the marked increase in domestic inter-bank borrowings, particularly during the third quarter of the year. The situation may have been exacerbated by the delayed repatriation of export proceeds by some exporters seeeking to benefit from a progressive depreciation of the exchange rate and the practice of some commercial banks to hold unduly large working balances abroad, again to gain from the exchange rate depreciation. The pressure on commercial bank liquidity was somewhat eased during the closing months of 1989, once deposit growth regained its momentum and repatriation of export proceeds assumed its normal course. However, the pressure for short-term funds from deficit banks, as well as the continuing high interest rates in other submarkets, caused the interest rates in the inter-bank call money market to remain high for most times of the year.",

Another note-worthy feature of Central Bank's asset growth was the fact that a considerable portion of the increase in total assets was reflected in the foreign assets of the Bank. The International Reserve (gross) of the Central Bank recorded an increase of Rs.2,343 million or 31 per cent in 1989, thus reversing a trend observed during the last few years when such assets continued to decline.

With a view to further moderating the rate of expansion of credit, a partial ceiling on credit was imposed on commercial bank credit to non-priority sectors in mid-1989. In terms of this measure, commercial banks were instructed that their outstanding advances which include loans, overdrafts, import bills and local bills financed, should not exceed the level as at May 31, 1989. However, credit facilities to priority sectors, including agriculture, industry, export trade and pre-shipment export bill financing were not restricted. In addition, advances granted under specific credit schemes for productive purposes (SMI Schemes Prajanaya Niyamaka Scheme, Village Adoption Scheme, Self-employment Scheme, etc.) and to long-term credit institutions and the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment for essential food imports were also exempted from the ceiling. In addition to these measures, a 100 per cent deposit margin requirement against Letters of Credit for specified luxury and semi-luxury items was imposed from 15th June, 1989. This was primarily aimed at arresting the worsening balance of payments position that existed in mid-1989.",

During the year, non-Central Bank sources were encouraged to increase their participation in the primary Treasury bill market through newspaper advertisements.

Discount and re-discount rates in this market were adjusted to reflect the movement of yields in the primary market for Treasury bills.

The civil disturbances in particular, took a heavy toll on the economy by way of widespread damage to property and the capital stock, and loss of output due to orchestrated work stoppages and prolonged shut-downs. The worst of course was the atmosphere of uncertainty and gloom that surfaced which seriously blunted the initiative and drive for investment and growth. Consequently, the average real growth rate during the period 1986-1988 slumped to 3 per cent. Meanwhile, in a background of continued and sustained fiscal expansion since 1986 with the annual budget deficit exceeding 11 per cent of GDP, the dawning of 1989 witnessed the emergence",

In fact, this was to take the form of a revamping of the adjustment programme already commenced in 1988 which witnessed heavy slippages in that year under the stress of an election year and continuing civil disturbances which made heavy demands on the Budget The programme basically aimed at stabilising the economy by arresting the deteriorating external payments position, achieving a safe level of fiscal balance and moderating the rate of monetary expansion to a level compatible with a tolerable level of inflation. The main elements of the programme were: (1) Progressive reduction of fiscal deficit by restraining expenditure and improving revenue performance. The overall budget deficit was expected to be reduced to 12.5 percent of GDP in 1989 and further to 10 per cent in 1990. (2) Containing of the current account deficit to about 10 per cent of GDP in 1989 and to be further reduced to 9 per cent in 1990. (3) Inflation was expected to be limited to about 12 percent in 1989 and to fall further to 10 percent by 1990. (4) Correction of domestic cost and price distortions by adjusting administered prices; (5) Restraining of credit growth and reform of the financial sector, (6) Flexible exchange rate management; (7) Public enterprises reform, (8) Reform of the public service to reduce over-staffing. Thus, the programme which included many significant policy thrusts was aimed at regaining macro economic stability with a view to shifting the economy back to its long term growth path. The monetary policy in particular was conducted with an eye on the need to a quick return to monetary and price stability.",

    "text": "The available evidence show that the stabilisation programme had been broadly on track, enabling the restoration of a considerable degree of stability into the economy. The attempts at economic stabilisation received further impetus by the precipitated improvement in the security situation during the closing months of 1989. In the event, most major macro economic aggregates performed as planned or better in 1989. The budget deficit had declined to 10.4 per cent of GDP as against a targetted deficit of 12.5 per cent, while expansionary financing of the budget deficit which was 4.1 per cent of the GDP in 1988 had been totally eliminated. The improvement in the performance of the budget came largely through improved revenue collection, strict controls on government expenditure and the deferment of certain capital expenditure commitments. Meanwhile, the reserve money growth had been maintained at 5 per cent as compared with 33 per cent in 1988. Following this, the annual rate of growth of narrow money supply Mi which amounted to 29 per cent in 1988 had declined sharply to 9 per cent in 1989, while the rate of growth of broad money supply M2 recorded a somewhat similar deceleration, from 16 per cent in 1988 to 12 per cent in 1989. The deceleration in the rate of growth of money supply had been brought about mainly through a sharp cut-back in the rate of domestic credit expansion both in favour of the Government and the private sector. While the Government reduced its borrowing require\u00adments through improved cash management and rationalisation of expenditure, the aggressive open market operations policy of the Central Bank enabled the divesting of a significant proportion of its holdings of Treasury bills to non-Central Banking sources. This resulted in a total elimination of bank financing for budgetary purposes in 1989. Meanwhile, temporary quantitative restrictions were imposed on private sector credit for non-essential purposes",

The gross exernal assets of the banking system increased from Rs. 18.4 billion as at the beginning of the year to Rs. 21.7 billion at the end of 1989 raising the country's import capacity to 3 months' imports.

The average annual inflation rate which stood at 14 per cent in 1988 was reduced to slightly below 12 per cent in 1989. However, during the last quarter of the year prices of major food items moved up in the market, mainly on account of supply bottlenecks and upward adjustments of certain administered prices to reflect their true costs.",

For instance, there is a continuing need to pursue fiscal adjustment and structural measures so that the benefits of the stabilisation gains made through fiscal moderation will not be frittered away. The monetary policy will continue to be geared to containing inflation and improving the performance of the external sector. The authorities' goal will be to keep monetary expansion in line with nominal GDP growth at the targetted inflation rate. It is important to create a climate which provides incentives for economic progress by encouraging innovation, saving, and investment. Markets perform these tasks more effectively when people can reasonably believe that by foregoing present consumption they can reap adequate rewards in the future. Higher saving and capital accumulation will enhance productivity and prospects for further development. Inflation insidiously undermines this process. When the inflation rate is excessively high, people tend to put their savings in foreign currencies, commodities or real estate rather than in financial instruments or claims on productive assets that will foster economic activity. Therefore, maintaining the inflation rate at a tolerable level is a matter of paramount importance for maintaining growth momentum in the economy.",
