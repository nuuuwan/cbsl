    "text": "After a continuous expansion commencing in 1958, the money supply recorded a contraction of Rs. 56 \u2022 8 million in 1966. In earlier Annual Reports attention was drawn to the tendency for money supply to expand in the face of declining external assets. Thus, during the years 1958\u20141964, although external banking assets con\u00adtracted as a result of the deterioration in the balance of payments, the money supply expanded considerably because expansionary factors operating on the money supply in those years \u2014 chiefly the inflationary financing of the Govern\u00adment's budget deficits and the growth in bank credit to the private sector \u2014 were strong enough to more than offset the contractionary effect emanating from the fall in external assets. A notable change took place in 1965 when the expansion\u00adary impact of the budget was considerably reduced by confining the financing of the deficit largely to non-bank sources. Nevertheless, the money supply recorded an increase in that year too \u2014 though at a much slower rate than in previous years \u2014 principally due to an improvement in external assets.",

    "text": "The improvement in the balance of payments situation did not, however, con\u00adtinue into the year 1966 and there was a sharp decline in external banking assets during the year. This had a powerful contractionary effect on the money supply. The combined effect of this and other contractionary factors was only partly offset by certain expansionary factors, the most important of which was an increased recourse to borrowing from the banking system by the Government. Consequent\u00adly, the money supply declined to a level of Rs. 1,658-9 million at the end of 1966 from Rs. 1,715-7 million as at the end of the previous year. Table II (C) 1 gives monthly figures of money supply for 1966 and for the preceding five years.",

After a de\u00adcline of Rs. 49 \u2022 4 million in the first three months of the year, it increased by Rs. 90 \u2022 6 million in the next four months to reach a peak level of Rs. 1,756 \u2022 9 million at the end of July. The last five months of the year were characterized by a sharp declining trend in money supply. Thus, although there was an appreciable con\u00adtraction in money supply during the year as a whole, the average level of money supply in 1966 was higher than that in the previous year. The monthly average of money supply for 1966 was Rs. 1,686 million which was Rs. 36 million higher than the corresponding average for 1965. This, together with the fact that the contraction in money supply was concentrated in the last few months of the year, may be one reason why there were no marked deflationary conditions in the eco\u00adnomy and prices remained relatively stable during the year under review.",

The volume of credit extended by the Central Bank to the Government was further increased by a rise of Rs. 26-4 million in provisional advances. A contractionary effect of Government operations during the year was the accumulation of cash balances amounting to Rs. 62-7 million which was con\u00adsiderably higher than in the previous three years. This was entirely due to a rise in special counterpart funds of the Government.1 An equally large contractionary effect came from the reduction of commercial bank credit to the Government sector. After a continuous increase in the commercial banks' holdings of Treasury Bills, Government and Government guaranteed securities and Government import bills for several years, the trend was reversed in 1966 when these holdings were reduced by Rs. 64-2 million. The net effect on money supply of the Government sector's operations was an expansion of Rs. 80-6 million.",

This represents an increase of 1-8 per cent as compared to an increase of D \u2022 4 per cent in 1965. This increase took place in spite of a fall of Rs. 44 \u2022 1 million in total deposit liabilities of the commercial banks because the increases of Rs. 41 - 2 million in inter-bank borrowing, Rs. 16 0 million in paid-up capital and reserve funds and Rs. 18-2 million in other liabilities more than counterbalanced the fall in deposits. The ratio of total deposits to total liabilities declined from 85-2 per cent in 1965 to 81 3 per cent in 1966.",

    "text": "There were some changes in the composition of deposit liabilities during the year. Government deposits which constituted 11-1 per cent of total deposits in 1965 recorded a larger contraction than private deposits (including deposits of Government corporations and co-operative institutions). Of the total fall of Rs. 44-1 million in deposit liabilities of banks, Rs. 28-2 million was due to the contraction of Government deposits, mainly time deposits. The ratio of Govern\u00adment deposits to total deposits was consequently reduced from 11-1 per cent in 1965 to 9-6 per cent in 1966. The contraction of Rs. 15-1 million in private deposits was the net result of a contraction of Rs. 32-6 million in demand deposits and an expansion of Rs. 17 \u2022 5 million in time and savings deposits. The ratio of demand deposits to total deposit liabilities declined slightly from 60-7 per cent in 1965 to 59-9 per cent in 1966. Changes in the distribution of bank deposits among different categories of owners in the private sector are shown in Table II (C) 6.",

The ratio of liquid assets to total deposits similarly declined from 38-2 per cent to 33 per cent. This was caused mainly^ by a contraction in cash on hand and deposits with the Central Bank, in bills-discounted and, to a smaller extent, by a fall in Treasury Bill holdings. Of the less liquid assets, loans and overdrafts outstanding increased by Rs. 65 million, thereby raising their ratio to total deposits from 43 0 per cent at the end of 1965-to 48-6 per cent at the end of 1966.",

The total amount of loans and. advances extended by the commercial banking system to the private sector increased by Rs. 93-7 million in 1966 as against Rs. 4-2 million in 1965. This is-significant not only because the increase of credit by the commercial banks was-high when compared with that in the previous year but also because the credit expansion occurred inspite of a decline in the totiil volume of deposits held by the public. In the absence of an expansion of deposits held by the public, credit expansion is possible either by a diversion of resources originally held in liquid form or by borrowing from other sources like the Central Bank. This emerges-clearly from an analysis of the ways in which the commercial banks raised, resources for credit creation in 1966.",

This push towards high interest rates is confirmed by an examination of the proportion of loans granted at rates up to 7 per cent. In 1965, 69-5 per cent of the total volume of loans granted by the commercial banks was given at interest rates of 7 per cent or less. In 1966, the proportion granted at the same interest rates went down to 60-6 per cent of the total loans. In other words, in 1965, 30-5 per cent of the total loans was given at interest rates above 7 per cent; in 1966 the percentage given at the same interest rates went up to 89-4 per cent.",
