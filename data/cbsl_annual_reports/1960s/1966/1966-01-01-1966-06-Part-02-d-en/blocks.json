There had. been a persistent increase in commercial bank credit to the private sector in the years up to 1965, and the Central Bank was particularly concerned with the possible emergence of excessive monetary demand and the speculative hoarding of goods. The monetary measures taken by the Central Bank in 1965 consisted of a rise in the Bank Rate and the imposition of ceilings on credit expansion b y commercial banks. The Central Bank also used moral suasion as an instrument to channel credit to productive purposes and to discourage credit for con\u00adsumption. A considerable slowing down of credit expansion was noticeable by the end of 1965. As compared to increases of Rs. 136-9 million and Rs. 62-8-million in the years 1963 and 1964, respectively, the increase in commercial bank credit to the private sector was only Rs. 4-2 million in 1965.",

However, there was no indication that the total volume of credit would reach the ceilings then in force.

On the recom\u00admendation of this Committee (which included the Director of Economic Research of the Central Bank), the Government has decided that cultivation loans, presently granted by the Department of Agrarian Services to members of co-operative societies, should in future be handled by the People's Bank and any other bank prepared to come into this scheme, acting in conjunction with the Central Bank. To give effect to this decision the Central Bank is formulating a scheme to guaran\u00adtee, on behalf of the Government, individual loans to cultivators up to a maximum of 75 per cent of the default on each loan. The cultivation loans scheme and the associated loan guarantee scheme are to come into operation in time to provide loans to farmers in the Maha season of 1967. The Central Bank will also re\u00adfinance loans given by commercial banks under this Scheme. A new division of Rural Credit has also been established within the Department of Economic Re\u00adsearch. This division would keep under constant study the problems of rural credit in Ceylon.",
