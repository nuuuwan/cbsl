Within the food group significant increases in prices were recorded against wheat flour, tea dust, milk food, condiments, spices, onions, potatoes, vegetables, beef, mutton and dried fish. The items that experienced a decline in prices were fresh fish, butter and cheese. During the year 1966 there were periodic scarcities in some common consumer goods such as chillies, onions, corriander, milk powder, and consequent sharp increases in their open market prices. These scarcities were not always the result of decreased imports. In fact there was a substantial increase in the imports of items such as fish products, grams and pulses, chillies and other currystuffs. Even in milk products of which there were acute shortages at times, the quantity imported in 1966 was slightly more than that in 1965. This would mean that an even distribution of foodstuffs was not achieved during the year.",

In 1965, however, the prices of textiles declined slightly below the prices prevailing in the previous year. In 1966, the index continued to decline and the decline was as much as 7*7 per cent. During the year even though the C.W.E. raised its textile prices, the quantity it brought into the market through its own shops and private trade, was big enough to bring down the open market prices substantially. The import price of textiles too declined during the period.",
