    "text": "In a country like Ceylon, where there is no well organized labour market, reliable and detailed data on employment and unemployment cannot be obtained* other than by elaborate surveys. One such survey, devoted completely to the collection of data on all employment aspects, was carried out in 1959/60. The Survey of Ceylon's Consumer Finances 1963, even though it had a different primary purpose, also provided significant data on the subject. There is a subsequent Report by an ILO Expert on an inquiry conducted in 1964 into the employment and unemployment problems of the rural population by means of a purposive sample of 13 villages. The results of the last mentioned survey needs to be used with caution because the sample was not random one and gave room for biases. As disclosed by the 1959/60 survey, the total number of unemployed in Ceylon was 340,000. The Survey of Consumer Finances conducted in 1963 estimated 458,000 as being unemployed.",
