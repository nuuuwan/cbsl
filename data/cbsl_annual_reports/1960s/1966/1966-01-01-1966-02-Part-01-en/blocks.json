The major factor responsible for this was the decline in earnings from exports. Adverse weather conditions, labour unrest and a drastic fall in the price of tea resulted in the value of tea exports alone declining by Rs. 183 million in 1966 as compared with 1965. The production of the three miajor coconut products also suffered a set-back as a result of drought. Rubber, on the other hand, recorded an increase in earnings arising from increased production. The combined result of these movements was that the net output of the export sector declined by 10-3 per cent in 1966, as against a rise of 2 - 4 per cent in the previous year.",

There\u00adafter, there was a sharp decline. Thus, although there was a decline in the money supply during the year as a whole, the actual decline was concentrated at the beginning and the latter half of the year.

This Index, however, does not adequately represent price changes-in the economy as a whole as its coverage is confined to changes in the cost of living of working class families in Colombo. While there were intermittent shortages of essential commodities during certain periods of the year, the supply situation during the year taken as a whole was more satisfactory than in the previous year. This combined with the mild monetary contraction should have reduced the pressure on the price level; there was some evidence of a slight easing of prices, especially those of textiles and some food items.",

This contractionary process was aided by an increase in Government's cash balances resulting from credits to the counter\u00adpart fund representing imports under aid programmes and by an increase in the financial assets of the private sector held in the form of time and savings deposits with the banking system. These contractionary factors were mitigated mainly by increased Government borrowing from the banking system and by an expansion of commercial bank credit to Government Corporations and the private sector.",

The fall in export earnings in 1966, even though it was from a somewhat high level in 1965, was so large as to make export earnings in 1966 the lowest recorded since 1958.

In fact, it was possible to finance a high level of imports in 1966 only by drawing down external assets which had been moderately built up in 1965 despite growing pressures for a higher level of import allocations in 1965. Ceylon's external reserves at the end of 1966 left absolutely no margin to meet unforeseen shortfalls in foreign exchange resources. Moreover, even this inadequate level of foreign exchange resources was maintained by increasing recourse to short-term borrowing abroad, especially from the International Monetary Fund. These liabilities fall due for payment within a maximum period of five years and can be repaid only at the cost of cutting down imports unless increasing foreign capital inflows and foreign exchange earnings become available. It is significant, in this con\u00adtext, to note that .in 1966 there was a total inflow of capital and an increase in short-term liabilities of Rs. 401 million, while interest payments, capital amortisation or repatriation and a decrease of short-term liabilities accounted for Rs. 188 million.",

Production of tea which had been increasing almost continuously in recent years suffered a set-back in 1966. Rubber produc\u00adtion, on the other hand, increased significantly and is likely to continue increasing as more and more replanted areas come into production. Coconut production fell further in 1966, and it must be presumed that even if production increases somewhat in future years, there is unlikely to be a significant increase in the exportable surplus, as domestic consumption would increase with increasing population. While there might be some scope for the export of other goods, especially of some industrial goods, their net contribution to export earnings cannot be expected to be very large in the immediate future. Thus, the prospects for a substantial increase in export earnings appear to be remote. Available forecasts tend to confirm this conclusion.",

    "text": "Thus, it becomes necessary to turn to the import side for a solution to Ceylon's balance of payments problems. Here, Ceylon has been following a policy of import substitution in both industry and agriculture. More recently great emphasis has been placed oh a policy of import substitution in agriculture. The imports of food including subsidiary foodstuffs account for some 40 to 45 per cent of the total import bill. It is possible within a short period of years to reduce Ceylon's food imports substantially by domestic food production. The growing shortage of rice supplies in world markets has served to underline the need for an intensive food drive within the country. In fact, the rice ration had to be halved, due to inability to procure adequate supplies of rice from the world markets. Increased food production is dependent largely on making land, water and credit available, adopting better techniques of production and the better organization and co-ordination of development and production plans at the village level. It would also involve additional foreign exchange outlays for fertilizer, weedicides,",

In the process, there has been an untimely substitution of domestic industrial products having a high import content for domestic products with little or no import content. This, again, would be unnecessarily foreign exchange consuming. Any estimate of the foreign exchange content of some of these import substituting industries must also take into account the increased turnover of goods due to shortened durability and inferior quality standards.",

The purpose here is to draw attention to the existence of these problems. The Ministry of Industries has attempted to work out certain priorities for the allocation of foreign exchange to industry. This is a step in the right direction and it should be pursued with a view to attempt\u00ading a rationalisation of the industrial sector as a whole, so that, the allocation of scarce foreign exchange to the industries could be made in terms of national priorities and with the least possible wastage.",

    "text": "Economic growth in 1966 was inadequate even to cope with the increase in population. This combined with a large unfavourable movement in Ceylon's terms of trade led to a decline in real income. The monetary situation was kept under control and there was a small monetary contraction. Supplies of both imports and domestically produced goods were more satisfactory. As a result the pressure on domestic prices eased somewhat. The balance of payments situation gave cause for deep concern. Remedial measures designed to increase the extent of import substitution in agriculture as fast as possible have been initiated. Industries in the private sector and in the public sector are making some contribution to import saving. A solution to the balance of payments problems lies in the success of the import substitution policies in agriculture and industry. Greater attention would have to be given to ensure that allocations of scarce foreign exchange are utilized to the best possible advantage.",
