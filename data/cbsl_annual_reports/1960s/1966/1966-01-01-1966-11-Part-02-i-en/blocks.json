This consideration has particular relevance to Government imports, and more particularly to imports of rice, flour and sugar, which account for a considerable proportion of aggregate imports. The extent of the difference between actual imports of these three commodities and their imports as reflected in the customs recorded data is discussed at some length in the paragraphs that follow. Since October, 1966 -action has been taken by the Treasury to eliminate these shortcomings.",

The average price of exports, which had shown no variation during the years 1962 to 1964, rose slightly by 2 per cent in 1965. This tendency was, however, reversed in 1966, when the average price index declined by 5 per cent to 90.

The year 1966, witnessed a further increase, the aggregate volume index (as measured by the Central Bank Trade Indices, base 1958 = 100) at 107, indicating a rise of 89 per cent over 1965. The average price of imports, which had been rising steadily since 1062, continued its upward trend during 1966, the Bank's index of import prices at 119 rising by 9 per cent over the previous year.

The decline in the volume of exports was due mainly to a decline in exports of the principal foreign exchange earner, tea, which exports declined by 54 million pounds or by 11 per cent. The average f.o.b. price of tea registered a sharper decline than in the preceding year, and at Rs. 2-33 per pound was 12 cents per pound or 5 per cent lower than in 1\u00a3)65. Consequently, receipts from tea, declined sharply by Rs. 183 million or by 15 per cent. The share of tea export earnings in total exports fell from 62 per Cent to 60 per cent.",

This was fur\u00adther aggravated by the absence of U.A.R., the withdrawal of Libya from the Auc\u00adtions and the absence of Syria from the market due to payments difficulties. A further factor which accelerated the decline in prices was the increased availability \u2022of plain teas at the Colombo auctions.

Fluctuations in the price of tea during the first half of the year were limited and the market was sustained by the Seamen's strike. With the ending of the strike, however, values declined to the low level of 3sh. 4 \u2022 75d in July 1966. The market, however, reaches its customary low level at this time of the year, with the last of the offerings of the previous North Indian Season coinci\u00adding with the seasonal falling off in the quality of Ceylon offerings. . In August, with the arrival of the new season's crop the prices improved. This upward trend was continued in the three months following, when better quality Ceylon teas were on sale. The beginning of December brought an easier note to the Lon\u00addon sales, however, the overall price of tea at the close of the year was above that of an year ago.",

The prices of tea from all the other producing territories with the exception of Kenya and Tanzania recorded substantial falls. Kenya and Tanzania, however, recorded some gains, probably due to some improvement in the quality of the teas marketed by them. Increased availability of plain teas from the other producing countries, viz.

The greatest increase has been recorded in East Africa, where production increased by 27 mil\u00adlion pounds, while Indian production increased by 20 million pounds. Past ex\u00adperience indicate that the annual increases in production are being absorbed more by the producing countries themselves \u2014\u2022 India having the biggest internal market \u2014 than by the traditional importing countries. If not for this development, the effect on international prices would have been more serious. The International Tea Committee's estimates indicate that in 1 9 6 5 world supply of tea exceeded world absorption by 1 4 million pounds.8 The Committee did not make any esti\u00admates for 1 9 6 6 due to tardy release of official figures. Indonesia too has joined the People's Republic of China in blacking out data relating to her production and exports, thus making it impossible to assess the difference between world supply and absorption.",

Production of synthe\u00adtic rubber in 1966 has been estimated at 3,270,000 tons, which represents an in\u00adcrease of 255,000* tons or 8 per cent over 1965, while consumption at 3,215,000 tons shows an increase of 240,000 tons or 8 per cent over 1965. Production of natural rubber on the other hand has been estimated by the International Rubber Study Group at 2,305,000 tons, a decline of 22,500 tons or 1 per cent below 1965 and demand at 2,515,0002 tons shows an expansion of 160,000 tons or 7 per cent over last year.",

The figure of total imports overstates the changes in the value of imports actually received during this year and understates the value of imports in the preceding year. For example, in the ' food and drink ' sub-group of consumer goods imports, the Customs figure of imports of rice, flour, and sugar at Rs. 583 million, has exceeded the value of imports of these commodities actually received by the Food Commissioner by Rs. 121 million. In the preceding year the Customs data understated the value by Rs. 249 million.1 Adjusting for these differences the estimated value of imports was Rs. 184 million higher due mainly to increased imports under the foreign aid programmes.",

This problem arose mainly in respect of the Industrial sector imports and General Trade Quota imports. The same arose in regard to fertilizers, as nearly Rs. 1 6 million of fertilizer imports put up for aid financing during the second half of 1966, did not materialise.
