The increased revenue from cotton yarn, twist and piecegoods was on account of an increase in imports and to a variation in the method of levying duties on textiles. An increase in the duty on heavy oil ac\u00adcounted for the increased duty collections in the category motor spirits and liquid fuel, while an increase in imports and a 10 per cent surcharge on some items(2) was responsible for the marked increase in duty collections under the item \" other goods.\" The fall in revenue receipts in respect of tobacco and cigarettes'was due to a decrease in imports, while the decreased collections from duties on sugar was partly on account of a delay in the payment of duties by the Food Commissioner.",

    "text": "Source : Central Bank of Ceylon. (g) An amount of Rs. 36- 0 million representing the food subsidy bill for 1954/55 was transferred from advance accounts to recurrent expenditure in 1958/59. While this book adjustment is excluded from the figures for 1958/59 (vide note*), the figures for 1954/55 have been revised to include it. (A) Exclude payments of Rs. 37-0 million in 1959/60, Rs. 2-2 million in 1960/61, Rs. 0-2 million in 1961/62, 1962/63 and 1963/64, Rs. 21 \u2022 5 million in 1964/65 and Rs. 21 \u2022 1 million in 1965/66 to meet payments to international financial organisations financed through special loans from the Central Bank. (i) Capital expenditure chargeable to foreign grants have been brought within the Budget from 1960/61 onwards. Prior to 1960/61 only the unexpended balance of foreign grants, which were available to the Treasury as a source of Budgetary finance, were included under deposits (item 2A (ii)). (j) The figure of revenue for 1965/66 differs from that given in Government Accounts in that it excludes a book credit of Rs. 26-8 million from the Food Commissioner and Rs. 18-1 million of foreign grants classified under revenue, but includes a receipt of Rs. 0- 5 million, being arrears of the National Development Tax.

Profits from the sale of arrack in\u00adcreased by as much as Rs. 28 0 million, while revenue from the tobacco tax in\u00adcreased by Rs. 10 0 million. The Annual Report of 1965 had occasion to refer to the significant growth in revenue collections from the tobacco tax in recent years. In this connection it is noteworthy that in the five year period 1960/01 to 1965/66, revenue from the tobacco tax increased at a rate of 21 4 per cent (compound) annually.",

Borrowing from the Central Bank increased by Rs. 179 7 million, comprising an increase of Rs. 151 4 million of treasury bills and an increase of Rs. 28 3 million in Central Bank advances to Government. On the other hand, and contrary to the pattern of the previous financial year, there was a net fall in borrowing from commercial banks. The decrease in the borrowing from the commercial banking system (Rs. 17-4 million), was the combined result of a fall in holdings of treasury bills (Rs. 15-9 million) and government securities (Rs. 1 \u2022 6 million), partly offset by an increase of Rs. 0 \u2022 1 million in commercial bank holdings of tax reserve certificates.",

This' increase was consequent to the amendment of the Inland Revenue Act No. 4 of 1963 providing for investments made by individuals in Government securities to be treated as approved savings qualifying for relief under Section 69A of this Act, as illustra\u00adted by the allotment of the 8 | per cent (5 to 7 year) loan_and the 4 per cent (21 to 25 year) loan floated in March/April, 1966.",
