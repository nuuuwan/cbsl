    "text": "In 1966, the Central Bank commenced an island-wide sample survey to collect data on the cost of production of paddy in Ceylon. Such basic information on paddy production has not been collected so far on any systematic basis. At present, apart from results of controlled field experiments, we have only a general idea of the relationship between individual inputs and the resulting paddy yields in the country as a whole. More precise and quantitative data will assist in the analysis of the relative importance of labour, capital, fertilizer and other inputs and in planning for increased paddy yields in Ceylon.",

In the next section, expenditure on hired labour, ' Attan' labour, own labour and on buffaloes and tractors, as well as the number of man-days of labour utilized were enumerated for each opera\u00adtion, at each stage of cultivation, viz., preparatory tillage (first and second plough\u00ading, puddling, harrowing, plastering bunds, constructing drains, etc.); nursery preparation (preparing nursery, applying fertilizer, sowing, weeding and irrigation); planting (broadcasting, transplanting, etc.); weeding (hand and rotary weeding, applying weedicides); manuring, pest control and harvesting, (harvesting, threshing, winnowing, bagging). In another section, data was sought on quantities and cost of materials purchased (seed paddy, fertilizers, weedicides etc.) as well as the imputed value of materials obtained free, and on transport costs. Finally, details of capital expenditure during the season were required.",
