Whereas in 1965 the balance of payments reflected an improved position on merchandise account and invisibles account over 1964, in 1966, there was a marked deterioration. In 1965 the mer\u00adchandise account on commercial transactions reflected a surplus of Rs. 128 million but in 1966 such transactions showed a deficit of almost Rs. 123 million. Like\u00adwise in 1965, Ceylon's invisible transactions (excluding gifts in kind) showed a sur\u00adplus of approximately Rs. 8 million, but in contrast there was a deficit of Rs. 19 million in 1966. The substantial deficits recorded in the merchandise and invisibles accounts of Ceylon's balance of payments in 1966 resulted in a total current account deficit of Rs. 142 million in transactions on commercial account, as compared with a surplus of Rs. 136 million in 1965.",

    "text": "The adverse current account position in Ceylon's balance of payments was principally a result of a sharp fall of Rs. 156 million in export receipts below the anticipated target when the foreign exchange budget was formulated at the beginn\u00ading of 1966. As compared with 1965 the drop in export income has amounted to approximately Rs. 235 million. Combined with the adverse change in export income there has been an increase in import payments and larger outward transfers on account of invisibles payments and particularly the repatriation of investment income. Ceylon's balance of payments difficulties on current account were further aggravated in 1966 by a substantial increase in the amounts that were needed in foreign exchange for the amortisation or repatriation of earlier foreign capital inflows in the form of official loans or foreign private investment in Ceylon; these commitments amounted to almost Rs. 114 million in 1966, as compared with only Rs. 75 million in 1965.",

Since the volume of consumption goods imports had already been cut down to very low levels by the end of 1965, further curtailment of imports in 1966 would have entailed a further curtailment of raw material and capital goods imports, with resultant dimunition in the levels of domestic capital formation, under utilisation of existing plant capacity and reduction in the rate of economic growth. The task of internal price stabilization would also have been much more difficult. In the",

This was made possible by (a) drawing down Ceylon's external assets which had been built up to molerate levels at the close of 1965, (b) obtaining long and medium-term foreign loans and grants, (c) accumulating short-term liabilities in the form of deferred payments, and (d) borrowing short-term from foreign sources, principally the International Monetary Fund. In 1966, therefore, Ceylon was able to sustain a higher level of external resource utilisation as compared with 1965, principally as a result of the cushion of external assets which had been built up in the course of 1965 on the one hand and the assistance she obtained from donor countries, other trading partners and the International Monetary Fund, on the other.",

    "text": "Merchandise exports in 1966 at Rs. 1,674 million were Rs. 235 million lower than in 1965. Merchandise imports (inclusive of aid finance imports) were Rs. 2,023 million or Rs. 101 million higher than in 1965. Accordingly, the trade deficit of Rs. 349 million in 1966 contrasted with a trade deficit of Rs. 13 million in 1965. The principal factors affecting the substantial decline in export receipts in 1966 were a sharp decline in the volume of domestic exports wtih the exception of rubber and an all round decline in average export price. One of the principal reasons for the decline in export volume as compared with the previous year was a decline in production, particularly in respect to tea and coconut. The sharp fall in tea ex\u00adports in 1966 also reflected the fact that in 1965 a higher volume of exports was made possible by running down stocks. In addition, the strike which supervened in the last quarter of 1966 may have had some effect in slowing down the volume of exports in the last few months of 1966. In contrast to the depressed volume of exports of tea and coconut, however, the volume of rubber exports showed a marked increase in 1966, as compared with the previous year, reflecting primarily an increase in output with the coming into production of some of the replanted areas.",

    "text": "The poor performance in terms of export volume in 1966 was further aggra\u00advated by an almost uniform decline in prices of all the major and minor commodities exported in 1966. Thus as measured by a Central Bank index of prices (1958 = 100) the average export price of tea declined from 89 in 1965 to 85 in 1966, which is the lowest recorded level for 14 years. The index of rubber prices declined from 91 in 1965 to 90 in continuation of a trend which had commenced in 1960. Increased releases from the U.S. Stockpile of rubber and a resumption of exports on a larger scale from some of the principal producer countries may have had some impact on the total supply of rubber in 1966 and consequently depressed prices. In 1965, the average export price of minor products improved as compared with the previous year, but in 1966, there was a further relapse which tended to wipe out the gains made in 1965.",

Of this amount aid financed imports at Rs. 224 million in 1966 were Rs. 83 million higher than aid imports received in 1965. The higher level of aid imports in 1966 reflected principally the greater volume of aid made available to Ceylon as a result of the aid negotiations in 1965. Imports financed out of Ceylon's own resources in 1966 amounted to Rs. 1,799 million and were Rs. 18 million more than such imports in the previous year, partly reflecting the fact that when the Foreign Exchange Budget was formulated in early 1966, the estimated volume of export earnings in 1966 was expected to be somewhat lower than in 1965. In the event, however, actual receipts from exports declined to a level much lower than the forecast that was made at the time of formulation of the foreign exchange budget for 1966. Ceylon's ability to finance an import programme beyond her earned income in 1966, was, therefore made possible by the increased aid inflow combined with an increase in her short-term liabilities abroad and a reduction of external assets which had been built up to moderate levels in 1965.",

The reduced surplus on invisibles account was primarily a result of a larger deficit on investment income as compared with the previous year, consequent on a substantial relaxation of the moratorium on investment income. The invest\u00adment income deficit which amounted to Rs. 15 4 million in 1965 rose to Rs. 42 1 million in 1966. Releases of blocked investment income amounted to Rs. 13 -5 million in the first half of 1966 and thereafter releases were permitted at Rs. 3-5 million per month making a total of Rs. 21 million in the second half of 1966. These releases were made at a time when export earnings were declining sharply and the lbalance of payments was under severe pressure and it therefore represented a determined effort on the part of Ceylon to discharge as far as possible all accumula\u00adted liabilities. Of the blocked funds so released only Rs. 29-2 million was remit\u00adted in 1966. Minor increases were also recorded in Ceylon's outlay on travel and private transfers in 1966, as compared with the previous year. Another principal factor accounting for the deterioration in the invisibles account in 1966 was the decline in official transfers in the form of grants to Ceylon ; their value (in\u00adcluding U.S. PL 480 Rupee transfers) fell from Rs. 64-4 million in 1965 to Rs. 62 \u2022 9 million in 1966.",

Gross receipts of long-term capital in 1966 amounted to Rs. 199 million and consisted of Project Loans totalling Rs. 80 million and Commodity Loans totalling Rs. 118 million. Ceylon's gross external debt on long-term account now stands at Rs. 913-2 million, of this sum the amount owed to the International Monetary Fund (excluding service charges payable in rupees) amounts to Rs. 271 -7 nullion. Long-term capital re\u00adceived in 1966 was utilised both to finance current needs of consumption and invest\u00adment and to continue work on development projects initiated in terms of project aid negotiated earlier. Of the commodity loan imports received in 1966 almost all consisted of investment goods and raw materials required for maintenance and fuller utilization of existing plant capacity . Project loans received in 1966 were utilised for the continuation of work on the Grandpass Thermal Project (Rs. 6-8 million), the Maskeliya Oya Project (Rs. 5-5 million), the Kandy Water Supply Scheme (Rs. 1*0 million), Railway modernization (Rs. 6-2 million) and Port Development (Rs. 4 \u2022 6 million).

During the period under review Ceylon utilised the various borrow\u00ading arrangements available to her under the Fund's first and second Standby Arrangements; the last instalment of Rs. 35 \u2022 7 million under the terms of the First Standby was not utilized, due to the conclusion of a Second Standby authoriz\u00ading a further total drawing of Rs. 119 million. Gross borrowings from tbe Inter\u00adnational Monetary Fund in 1966 amounted to Rs. 144 million. This consisted of a sum of Rs. 35-7 million under the terms of the first Standby Arrangement. A further sum totalling Rs. 89-3 million was borrowed under the terms of the second Standby, in the course of the second half of 1966. This was a period in which the balance of payments was being subject to increasing pressures and the I.M.F. draw\u00adings proved to be very useful, particularly in a period in which the general trend of interest rates in the principal financial markets abroad was rising.",

Similarly, the surplus of Rs. 56-7 million in trade with China in 1965 was reduced to Rs. 6-9 million in 1966, mainly due to a rise of Rs. 41-3 million in import payments. The surplus of Rs. 39-4 million with the Soviet bloc in 1965 was transformed into a deficit of Rs. 18-2 million in 1966, principally due to a decline of Rs. 49 million in export income.",

    "text": "The smaller trade surplus with the Dollar Area in 1966 was not compensated by aid inflows, which only rose from Rs. 57-1 million in 1965 to Rs. 69-5 million in i966. Similarly in the case of China the reduction in the current account surplus from Rs. 56-7 million in 1965 to Rs. 6-9 million in 1966, was not matched by compensatory inflows of aid which in fact declined from Rs. 24-6 million in 1965 to Rs. 11-5 million in 1966. The same position held true for the Soviet bloc. In contrast, however, the reduction in the current account surplus on commercial transactions with the United Kingdom from Rs. 87-1 million in 1965 to Rs. 39-2 million in 1966 (a loss in foreign exchange of Rs. 47-9 million) was partly compen\u00adsated by an increase in aid inflows from Rs. 2-3 million in 1965 to Rs. 32-5 million (or by Rs. 30 \u2022 2 million). Similarly, an increase in the current account deficit with India on commercial transactions was partly modified by an increase of Rs. 11-1 million in aid inflows.",

    "text": "In retrospect it would appear that the policy of building up Ceylon's external assets in 1965 and reducing her short-term liabilities as far as possible was a sound one. Payments developments in 1966 arising out of unforeseen declines in export earnings, sharp fluctuations between export receipts and payments over exceeding\u00adly short periods, and the disruption to economic activity caused by strikes in the commercial and banking sectors, all made it imperative to mobilize a sum well in excess of the increase in external assets that occurred in 1965. In fact during 1966, Ceylon was in addition forced to borrow at various times from foreign banking sources in order to supplement the country's external assets in order to finance imbalances in Ceylon's trade and payments. Such borrowings were particularly heavy in the period August to December 1966, when the balance of payments was subject to severe pressures arising out of the strike in the commercial sector which prevented exports from flowing out. In addition, in the course of 1966, Ceylon increased her liabilities under Payments Agreements by approxi\u00admately Rs. 30 million and this also proved to be useful in limiting the pressure on the country's external reserves.",

    "text": "During 1966 Ceylon borrowed various sums in foreign exchange from the Inter\u00adnational Monetary Fund under the terms of the First and Second Standby Arrange\u00adments concluded in June 1965, and June 1966, respectively. A sum of Rs. 35-7 million was borrowed in January 1966, under the terms of the First Standby Arrangement. Subsequently, further sums totalling Rs 89-3 million were drawn from the Fund under the terms of the Second Standby Arrangement. In addi\u00adtion a separate special drawing of Rs. 19 million was made in March, 1966, to pay Ceylon's gold subscription to the Fund as a result of the increase in Ceylon's quota to Rs. 371-3 million. During the period under review repayments to the Inter\u00adnational Monetary Fund in terms of earlier drawings totalled Rs. 53 \u2022 6 million, so that the net amount borrowed from the Fund in 1966 amounted to Rs. 90-4 million. Fund assistance to Ceylon during 1966 was intended to enable the successful pursuit of a Stabilization programme intended to ensure the fuller mobilization of the country's resources with price stability. In the face of the continuing external payments difficulties that beset the economy in the course of 1966, the assistance Ceylon received from the International Monetary Fund proved to be most useful in alleviating its payments difficulties and in supporting its \u2022external reserves.",
