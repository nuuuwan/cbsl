(a) Private Sector

Production

Principal Trends

The analysis of industrial production given below has been based as in the previous years, on returns furnished by industries in the private sector. These industries have been placed in 21 industrial categories. In some of the categories as indicated in Table II (B) a. 1 the number of firms that sent in returns this year was less than in 1965. But despite this the total number of industrial firms furnish­ing data increased slightly from 1381 to 1394.

On the above basis, the value of industrial production rose from Rs. 847-0 million in 1965 to Rs. 850 • 3 million, an increase of 0 • 39 per cent as against 57 • 6 per cent in 1965.1 Gains in industrial output were achieved in Miscellaneous food prepa­rations, Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery, Miscellaneous chemical products and Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies. Some of these industrial groups bad a higher level of output even though in some «ases fewer firms sent in returns. It is not possible to indicate the extent to which the present survey gives an accurate picture of the total output of the major cate­gories of products or the extent to which the survey covers industries in actual production. Some of those that did not send in returns may have gone out of production because of competition from the more efficient units or the non­availability of adequate supplies of raw materials. However, in most cases, firms that did not send in returns were usually the smaller units in these industrial groups and it is possible that the increase in output of the larger unifs which have been included here has more than off-set the effect on total output of the non-inclusion of the smaller units whose output has not been included here.

In 1966, 86 firms in the category Miscellaneous food preparations furnished data as. against 96 in the previous year. Output increased from Rs. 109 -2 million to Rs. 134 • 5 million. In the group Vegetable oils and fats the number of reporting firms was almost the same, but there was a sharp fall in output from Rs. 190-4 million in 1965 to Rs. 142-3 million in 1966. In the Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industries production increased from Rs. 34 • 9 million to Rs. 38-6 million even though the number of reporting units decreased by seven. Output in the Beer and stout making industries decreased sharply from Rs 7-6 million in 1965 to Rs. 5-5 million in 1966 owing to an inadequacy of raw materials while the number of reporting units increased from one to two. In the Tobacco industry the number of units increased from 460 in 1965 to 473 in 1966 but the increase in production was negligible. Similarly, in the Knitted fabrics and

i The sharp increase in 1965 was due to a substantial widening of the scope of the Survey in that year.

made-up garments industries the number of reporting units increased from 110 to 123 with little change in the value of output. Returns from industries in the Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles were received from 81 as against 66 in 1965 and production increased from Rs. 91-3 million to Rs. 95-1 million. In the Footwear and leather products industries the number of firms that furnished data decreased from 52 to 45 while output increased from Rs. 24-7 million in 1965 to Rs. 27-7 million in 1966.

Firms making Rubber products (excluding footwear) decreased by 6 units to 21 with a fall in output from Rs. 19-1 million in 1965 to Rs. 18-9 million in 1966. Firms in the Miscellaneous chemical products group decreased from 123 to 119 while production increased from Rs. 91 • 2 million to Rs. 101 • 9 million. In the cate­gories Metal products, Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies and Manufactured products not elsewhere specified, the number of reporting firms increased and there were appreciable gains in production. For metal products output increased from Rs. 44-7 million in 1965 to Rs. 49 0 million in 1966; for Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies from Rs. 14-0 million to Rs. 20-8 million and for Manufactured products not elsewhere specified from Rs. 14-7 million to Rs. 16-2 million. In Ceramics, Plywood, Mineral sands and Basic industrial chemicals where there is only one firm in each category, gains in production were reported in Plywood and Basic industrial chemicals. The number of reporting firms in the group Cement, cement products and asbestos products fell from 13 to 11 and output fell from Rs. 36-5 million to Rs. 28-8 million.

Production analysed by type of industry

Within the group Miscellaneous food preparations where an overall increase in production has taken place, the increases in output were in the dairy products and the cattle and poultry foods industries. Dairy products increased from Rs. 13-0 million in 1965 to Rs. 15-3 million in 1966 whereas the output of cattle and poultry foods more than doubled from Rs. 26-4 million in 1965 to Rs. 61-1 million in 1966. The output of salt also increased sharply from Rs. 1-5 million in 1965 to Rs. 5-1 million in 1966. The other categories, desiccated coconut and ice did not show increases. The increase of dairy products has been appreciable since 1962. The current level of output is almost five times the value in 1962. The sharp increase in cattle and poultry foods which was three times as much as in 1962 is mainly due to a considerable expansion in the poultry breeding industry and the substitution of local poultry foods with the curtailment of imported supplies.

Two of the four groups of products under the ftrincipal group Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery increased. The output of biscuits in­creased from Rs. 14-8 million in 1965 to Rs. 19-6 million in 1966, boiled sweets increased from Rs. 7-6 million to Rs. 9-6 million, while chocolates and toffees de­creased from Rs. 10 million to Rs. 7 million. The Beer and stout industry which was producing an average output of about Rs. 2-4 million up to 1964 increased its production to Rs. 7 • 6 million in 1965, but production fell in 1966 to Rs. 5 • 5 million

( 4 6 )

The production of shirts increased from Rs. 30-3 million in 1965 to Rs. 37-3 million in 1966 while other made-up garments fell from Rs. 25 2 million to Rs. 18-8 million. The value of output of shirts in 1966 has been the highest so far. In the Rubber goods industries, there was an increase in the out­put of tyre retreading while manufacture of cycle tyres and tubes decreased by about 30 per cent. This increase was partly the result of a shortage of new impor­ted motor car tiyres in the market at various times during the year. The manu­facture of pharmaceuticals including glycerine was valued at Rs. 13-2 million and represented more than three times the value of output in 1963. The upward trend in the production of cosmetics has continued from year to year ; the value of out­put increased from Rs. 7-5 million in 1965 to Rs. 7-8 million in 1966 and the current level of output is more than double the level of output in 1962. There is a similar trend in the production of soaps and cleaning compounds where output has tended to increase progressively. The current level of output of Rs. 49-7 million may be compared with the value of output of Rs. 34-0 million in 1963. The production of safety matches has shown an erratic trend. In 1962 the value of output was Rs. 5-6 million, in 1963 production fell to Rs. 4-5 million but rose to Rs. 12-3 million in 1965 and in 1966 it has fallen again to Rs. 8-7 million. With regard to Metal pioducts, all categories except barbed wire, reported lower production figures. The most significant fall was in aluminiumware where output fell from Rs. 9-0 million to Rs. 7-7 million ; but the level of production in 1966 was higher than in 1963. The production of wire nails fell from Rs. 3-8 million to Rs. 2-9 million, and metal containers from Rs. 9 • 3 million to Rs. 8 • 5 million. The output of manu­factured products out of plastics increased from Rs. 8-8 million to Rs. 10 • 7 million continuing a steady growth from a level of Rs. 2-5 million in 1962.

Relative shares of Industries in Total Output

The relative position of Industries within Major Industrial Groups

Within the Group Miscellaneous food preparations the relative share of cattle and poultry foods represented 45-4 per cent of total output whereas in 1965 the share was 24-2 per cent. Desiccated coconut which represented 57-0 per cent of total output in 1965 in this category declined to 37-0 per cent in 1966. The relative share of dairy products has changed very little. With the increase in output of salt the share of salt in total output within this category increased from 1-4 per cent in 1965 to 3-8 per cent in 1966. In the categories jams, jellies, sauces, etc., under the major category Preserved and canned fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and other sea foods, there was very little change. The percentage decreased very slightly from 63 0 per cent in 1965 to 62-7 per cent in 1966 while the share of the other products within this group increased slightly from 37-0 per cent in 1965 to 37 • 3 per cent in 1966. The share of biscuits within the main indus­trial group Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery increased from 42-4 per cent in 1965 to 50-8 per cent in 1966. Since 1962, the output of biscuits as a percentage of production in this category decreased from 58 per cent in that year to 42 • 4 per cent in 1965 but rose thereafter to 50 • 8 per cent. The share of choco- <lates and toffees has fallen sharply from 28 • 6 per cent in 1965 to 18 • 1 per cent in 1966,

Cement, cement products and asbestos products fell from 4-3 per cent to 3-4 per cent.

Table II (B) a. 3 shows the relative shares in total output of the major indus­trial categories, classified as consumer, intermediate and investment goods.

In 1966, the relative share of consumer goods increased from 53 • 9 per cent to 56 • 5 per cent while intermediate goods decreased from 37 • 3 per cent to 34 • 9 per cent and investment goods from 8-7 per cent in- 1965 to 8-6 per cent in 1966. In the Consumer goods category changes in the relative shares of products coming within this group have not been significant except for Miscellaneous chemical products which increased from 10-8 per cent to 12-0 per cent and Paper, articles of paper and paper board which increased from 1 • 9 per cent to 2 • 6 per cent. Most of the other categories have fallen slightly or remained unchanged. The fall in intermediate goods has been due mainly to the fall in the share of Miscellaneous food preparations from 32 • 1 per cent to 28-9 per cent whereas the other items in. this category have not changed very much. The slight fall in the share of invest­ment goods in total output has been due to a fall in the share of Cement, cement products and asbestos products from 4-3 per cent in 1965 to 3-4 per cent in 1966 while the increases in the Metal products and Rubber products within this category were to some extent sufficient to offset this decrease.

The size of the Industrial Unit

The size distribution of manufacturing firms according to value of output is given in Table II (B) a. 4.

Of the 791 reporting firms, as against 782 in 1965, 527 firms are in the category where the annual value of output is less than Rs. 250,000 as against 540 in 1965. In the group where output is between Rs. 250,000 and Rs. 2 million there were 215 firms as against 188 in 1965. In 1965 there were 54 firms whose value of output was over Rs. 2 million, but in 1966 the number has decreased to 49. The princi­pal change has been in the group with an output of between Rs. 250,000 and Rs. 2 million where the number of firms has increased by 27. This increase has taken place along with a reduction in the number of firms in the category with an output of less than Rs. 250,000. The share of firms whose value of output was greater than Rs. 2 million was 63-6 per cent as against 66 per cent in 1965 whereas those whose output was between Rs. 250,000 and Rs. 2 million was 28 -6 per cent as against 26 per cent in 1965 and those less than Rs. 250,000, 7-8 per cent.

In the group Preserved and canned fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and other sea foods, in 1965 there were 29 firms whose value of output was less thanRs. 250,000 producing 35 per cent of total output whereas in 1966, the number of firms had decreased to 21 producing 26 • 7 per cent of output. In firms with an output of between Rs. 250,000 and Rs. 2 million there was a marked change in the relative shares of output; in 1965 there were 3 fi-ms producing 20 per cent of the output whereas in 1966, there were 5 firms producing 73-3 per cent of the output. In

( 51 )

the Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry the larger units have continued to predominate. Here 4 firms are responsible for 60 - 8 per cent of the output in 1966 as against 5 firms responsible for 55 per cent of the output in 1965. In the Soft drinks and carbonated waters industry, five firms in 1965 with a total output of over Rs. 2 million manufactured 76 per cent of the products, while in 1966 one firm whose output was in excess of Rs. 2 million produced 54-7 per cent reflecting that during the year one firm has gained a very substantial share of the market at the expense of its competitors. In the Knitted fabrics and arti­cles and made-up garments industry although there are a large number of smaller units, 87 in 1966 and 76 in 1965, with an output less than Rs. 250,000, yet the major portion of output was in the hands of 6 large industries in 1965 and 5 in 1966, now producing 51 per cent of total output. The position in the Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles group is similar; in 1965 there were 44 firms with an output of less than Rs. 250,000 and having a 3 per cent share of total output whereas in 1966 there were 52 industries in this group with 3-3 per cent of total output. In

1965 there were 7 firms in this category whose output was in excess of Rs. 2 million producing 87 per cent of the total, whereas in 1966 there were 8 firms in this cate­gory producing 83-5. per cent of total output.

In the Footwear and leather products industry the share of the 3 major firms whose output was over Rs. 2 million remained unchanged at approximately

7 8 per cent between 1965 and 1966. In the Rubber products industry (excluding footwear) the position between 1965 and 1966 has changed little with 3 firms whose value of output was in excess of Rs. 2 million enjoying 65-3 per cent of total output.

In the Miscellaneous chemical products industry there were 8 firms with an -output in excess of Rs. 2 million producing 71 • 1 per cent of output in' 1966 as against 74 per cent in 1965. In 1965 in the Paper, articles of paper and paper board industry there were two firms with an output of over Rs. 2 million producing 42 per cent of the output, whereas in 1966 there was one firm in this category pro--ducing.54 • 2 per cent of total output. In the Metal products industry 35 firms with an output between Rs. 250,000 and Rs. 2 million were controlling 45-8 per cent of total production in 1966 whereas in Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies two firms in the over Rs. 2 million group controlled 34-2 per cent in 1966 as against one industry controlling 26-0 per cent in 1965. In the Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies industry there were 15 industries with an output of between Rs. 250,000 and Rs. 2 million producing 61 • 2 per cent. In the category Manufactured products not elsewhere specified there were no large units with an output in excess of Rs. 2 million either in 1965 or 1966. There were 18 units with an output between Rs. 250,000 and Rs. 2 million producing 73-5 j>er cent of the output and 63 units with an output of less than Its. 250,000 produc­ing 26-5 per cent of total output.

The size distribution of firms analysed according to the size of the wage bill is given in Table II (B) a. 5. As pointed out in previous years the more approp­riate indicator of the size of the industrial firm is total output. This table has been

included here in order to give some indication of the potential for earning wage income provided by the industrial sector. The data shows that the largest ave­nues for earning wage income are provided by 22 firms whose wage bill is in excess of Rs. 500,000 per year accounting for 90-44 per cent of the total wages paid out in the industrial groups included here. . There are 163 firms with a wage bill of between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 500,000 and representing 9-38 per cent of total wages paid and 253 firms had a wage bill between Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 50,000 and their wage payments were 0 - 1 4 per cent of the total. The bulk of the industrial firms had wage bills of less than Rs. 15,000. There were 353 firms in this category and the total wage bill was only • 04 per cent. Since most of the wages in these industrial categories are regulated by minimum wage fixing machinery the vari­ation in the size of the wage bill is due primarily to differences in the numbers employed in each of these industries rather than differences in wages paid to employees between firms within the same industrial group.

From the point of view of the wage bill large firms seem to predominate in some of the major industrial groups in Table II (B) a. 5. For instance, in Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery, one firm accounted for 35-6 per cent of the total wage bill, in Soft drinks and carbonated waters 2 firms accoun­ted for 69 • 1 per cent, in Beer and stout one firm for 80-8 per cent, in Footwear and leather products 2 firms for 71 -4 per cent and Paper, articles of paper and paper board one firm for 53-0 per cent of the total wage bill. A comparison of the data for 1965 and 1966 does not indicate that there has been a marked change in the size distribution of the manufacturing units based on the wage bill. In general terms, the earlier pattern seems to prevail with the exception that some of the large industrial firms have a slightly bigger share of the total wage bill in industry. This might indicate either an increase in wage levels or an increase in the total number of employees in each industrial unit reflecting a higher level of output.

The Use of Raw Materials

Of the 1,394 industries that sent in returns, 755 furnished data on the use and origin of industrial raw materials. The total value of raw materials used by 755 firms in 1966 was Rs. 260-6 million. In 1965, 1076 firms furnished data on utili­sation of raw materials valued at Rs. 221-2 million. In 1966, the value of foreign or imported raw materials was Rs. 167-8 million or 64-4 per cent and local raw materials Rs. 92-8 million or 35-6 per cent. The distinction made between the .local and foreign raw materials is not entirely accurate, because manufacturers very often classify imported materials purchased in the local market as local raw materials. Presumably the classification this year is slightly better than in 1965 when 57 per cent of the raw materials were classified as foreign and 43 per cent as local raw materials.

Industries with a very high foreign raw material component were Beer and stout 100per cent, Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles 91 • 4 per cent, Metal products 94-1 per cent, Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies

Employment

In 1966 the total number of employees in 1394 industrial units was 61,418 as against an employment figure of 56,835 in 1381 units in 1965. Whereas the num­ber of reporting industrial units increased by 13, employment rose by 4,583, reflect­ing that the expansion in industry during the year has. provided a fair amount of employment. Since the coverage of the surveys in 1965 and 1966 has been more or less the same, the increase in employment is probably due to greater employment opportunities rather than to an increase in coverage. The largest gains in employ­ment opportunities were in Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles, Metal products, Tobacco, Vegetable oils and fats and in Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery. Employment had decreased in Soft drinks and carbo­nated waters, Rubber products (excluding footwear) and Miscellaneous chemical products. In some cases even with a decrease in the number of reporting firms total employment has increased. For instance in Miscellaneous food preparations, the number of firms decreased from 96 in 1965 to 86 in 1966, whereas employment increased from 3,622 to 3,647. Similarly, in Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery the number of firms decreased from 65 to 58 but the number of employees increased from 2,927 to 3,192. In the Beer and stout making industry a new manufactory was included in the data in 1966 and this increased employ­ment from 338 to 416. In the Tobacco industry, the number of units increased from 460 to 473 while employment increased from 8,235, to 8,905. In the Knitted fabrics and articles and made-up garments industry the number of reporting firms increased from 110 in 1965 to 123 in 1966 while the number of employees increased from 6,341 to 6,916. In the Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles the number of firms increased from 66 to. 81 and the number of employees from 9,650 in 1965 to 11,904 in 1966.

Productivity and Wages

The total man-days increased from 15-3 million in 1965 to 16 1 million in 1966. The total man-days exceeded 2 million per annum in the Tobacco and Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles and it exceeded a 1 million per year in the Miscellaneous food preparations, Knitted fabrics and articles and made-up garments and Miscellaneous chemical products. The highest wage bills also appear in those industries with the highest number of man-days for the year. This to some extent indicates that wage payments have been mainly on the basis of daily pay.

The total Wage bill of reporting firms increased from Rs. 88-6 million in 1965 to Rs. 97-4 million in 1966. The highest wage bill of Rs. 22 million as against

Rs. 19 million in 1965 was in the Tobacco industry. The wage bill in the Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles increased from Rs. 9-9 million in 1965 to Rs. 13 • 8 million in 1966 and in the Miscellaneous chemical products industry from Rs.9; 4 million in 1965 to Rs. 10 -0 million in 1966. The data also indicates the relative disparities in wage levels in some industries. For instance, in the Miscellaneous food preparations industry there are 3,647 employees earning Rs. 5-4 million. In the Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles 11,904 employees received Rs. 13-8 million. As against this, in other industries where minimum wages have existed for a long time for instance, in the Tobacco industry where 8,905 employees re­ceived a wage bill of Rs. 22 million and in Miscellaneous chemical products where 4,704 employees earned Rs. 10 million, the average wage levels have been appre­ciably higher.

The wage per man-day rose from Rs. 5-78 in 1965 toRs.6-04 in 19661 The wage per man-day has increased substantially in most industries except in the Knitted fabrics and articles and made-up garments industry, Metal products, Plywood and Cement, cement products and asbestos products. In the Beer and stout making industry, the wage per man-day rose from Rs. 8-22 to Rs. 10-75 and in the Elec­trical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies industry from Rs. 7*19 to Rs. 9-25. High wages per man-day were also earned in the Soft drinks and car­bonated water industry (Rs. 7-60) Tobacco (Rs. 8-80), Footwear and leather products (Rs. 8-44) and in Ceramics (Rs. 10-18). The lowest earnings were in the Knitted fabrics and articles and made-up garments industry (Rs. 3-93) and in the Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate, and sugar confectionery group (Rs. 3-67). In the latter groups there has been a tendency during the last 5 years for the wage per man-day to be at a level generally less than Rs. 4/-.

On the use of power and fuel 227 firms sent data as against 221 firms in 1965. The value of fuel used was Rs. 9-1 million as against Rs. 5-0 million in 1965. Of the total cost of fuel used 45 per cent or Rs. 4-2 million was for electricity, Rs. 4-5 million for petrol and oil, and Rs. 322,000 for coal and gas. In 1965 the cost of electricity was Rs. 2-6 million or 51-5 per cent of power used and petrol and oil Rs. 544,000 or 10-9 per cent and coal and gas Rs. 1-6 million. The largest users of power were the Biscuits and cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry using power valued at Rs. 782,000, and the Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles industry using power valued at Rs. 1 million. The difference in the figures between 1965 and 1966 does not represent an absolute increase in the amount of power used but primarily more accurate reporting and better coverage.

Production

At the end of 1966, of the eighteen Industrial Corporations fifteen were in production, while three others had not commenced production.1 These were the Ceylon State Flour Milling Corporation, the Ceylon Steel Corporation and the Ceylon Tyre Corporation.

The production of cement at the Kankesanturai Cement Works had decreased by 2,428 tons, from 84,000 tons in 1965 to 81,572 tons in 1966. Over the preced­ing ten-year period the output of cement by the Corporation has tended to fluc­tuate, and the highest level of output of the Kankesanturai plant was attained in 1965. There has been no trend towards a progressively higher level of output, but this situation is likely to be reversed from 1967 onwards. Production capa­city has now been increased by the installation of a new kiln and accessory equip­ment in June 1966. In the middle of 1966, the old'kiln which had been in opera­tion since the establishment of the plant was shut down for repairs and modernisa­tion, and the new kiln was put into service. The fall in output during the year has been due to teething trouble in the new plant after it was brought into opera­tion. Both the old and the new kiln are expected to be in service in 1967; this should almost double the output of cement. In 1966 the terminal cement grind­ing and packing plant at Galle with an initial capacity of 100,000 tons per annum was completed. This plant was expected to utilize the surplus clinker from the Kankesan works to produce cement. Difficulties have been exparbneed in ensuring supplies of clinker because the original plan to transport clinker coast­wise by boat has not yet materialised.

The output of the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation increased appreciably by 2,385 tons from 6,696 tons in 1965 to 9,081 tons in 1966. The increase in output has been due to the plans initiated in 1980 to increase the rated capacity of the Mill from 3,750 tons to 9,000 tons by I960 and the full utilization of plant capacity. The Mill is now working at full capacity.

The output of the two main products of the Paranthah Chemicals Corpora­tion — caustic soda and chlorine — increased from 956 tons to 1,049 tons and 265 tons to 361 tons respectively in 1966. In addition, the Corporation also produced 69 tons of edible table salt. The increase in the output of chlorine was absorbed by an increase in the local requirements of this product. The Corporation was able to increase the output of caustic soda after the selling price of imported caustic soda was raised and the price of locally produced and imported caustic soda was fixed at Rs. 925 per ton.

The output of the Ceylon Ceramics Corporation fell by 50 tons, from 863 tons to 813 tons in 1966. Apart from finished domestic ceramicware, the Corporation < also produced 1,472 tons of refined kaolin. The slight fall in output was due to

the stoppage of kilns for repairs in the last two months of the year. The produc­tion of kaolin at the Kaolin Refinery is about 50 per cent below capacity as the demand for kaolin is low. Refined kaolin is used as a raw material for ceramic-ware and also for the manufacture of insecticide sprays, and inthe paper industry. The demand for kaolin as a raw material in these industries has tended to fluctuate and as a result the refinery has had to work well below its rated capacity.

The output of the Ceylon Leather Products Corporation consisted of hides, miscellaneous leather products, assorted leather products, split and chrome leather and shoes. In 1966 the output of shoes increased by 35,990 to 224,190 pairs, valued at Rs. 3-6 million ; the latter represented more than three-fifths of the value of total output of the Corporation. The production of chrome leather was about one-fifth of the total value of output. The value of assorted leather products was Rs. 209,290.

The output of the National Textile Corporation consisted of cotton yarn, cotton textiles and finishing of various types of textiles. The production of cotton yarn decreased slightly from 2-41 million pounds to 2-36 million pounds. The output of textiles was 2 • 8 million yards while 4 • 6 million yards of other materials were processed. These production figures were attained despite the stoppage of work for 2 months as a result of an industrial dispute in the textile mill.

The output of the Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation increased by 2,904 tons to 53,254 tons in 1966. At present the output of the Corporation is mainly ilmenite, but plans have been undertaken to extend production to other minerals.

The National Small Industries Corporation produces three categories of goods. The value of output of furniture increased from Rs. 4 • 36 million in 1965 to Rs. 4 • 43 million, tiles and bricks from Rs. 1-56 million to Rs. 2-53 million, the value of ayurveda drugs produced was Rs. 600,000. Production in the Carpentry Section has been determined by the costs of labour and raw materials. Factors affecting production in the brick and tile section have been absenteeism, frequent breakdowns of machinery and technological problems.

The output of the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation consisted of the preparation of inorganic fertilizers for paddy, coconut, tea, rubber and other crops. The total amount of fertilizers issued for agricultural purposes was 107,147 tons in 1966 as against 92,057 tons in 1965.

The value of output of the State Hardware Corporation was Rs. 360,000. The Corporation started production in 1966.

The principal products of the Ceylon Plywoods Corporation consisted of tea chests, flush doors, block boards and plyboards. The total value of output in­creased from Rs. 5,200,000 in 1965 to Rs. 6,517,000. Approximately two-thirds of the value of output consisted of the manufacture of plywood for the making of tea chests.

The output of sugar of the Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation fell from 3,278 tons to 2,553 tons in 1966. During the year in addition 833,994 proof gallons of spirits were produced. The output of common salt by the National Salt Corporation rose from 382,589 cwts., in 1965 to 1-3 million cwts., in 1966. This statistical increase in the output of salt by the Corporation was the result of the inclusion of Salt Department production figure with that of the National Salt Corporation after the Salt Department merged with the Corporation in July 1966.

Pricing Policy and Profits

The profits of the Ceylon Cement Corporation after tax were estimated at Rs. 2-5 million. The profits before payment of taxes in 1965 was Rs. 4-9 million. With the commissioning of new equipment the average cost of production of cement which is about Rs. 125 per ton is expected to fall appreciably. But even so the economy of the Kankesan Cement Works has been adversely affected due to the high rail transport cost of the finished products to the principal markets and of materials such as clay, gypsum and fuel that have to be transported to the plant The retail selling price of cement manufactured by the Corporation was Rs. 190 per ton while the price to Co-operative Unions, Government departments and Public Institutions was Rs. 180 per ton. In terms of the capital employed, the Ceylon Cement Corporation has shown the highest return of 12-6 per cent among the. Corporations.

With the substantial increase in output, the profits of the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation increased sharply from Rs. 1,462,762 to Rs. 3,411,085. After the Government agreed to increase its purchase price for various grades of paper, the Corporation was able to price its products on a realistic basis. The reduction in production costs in 1966 resulting from a larger output was offset by the increase in the world market price of raw materials and chemicals. Thus there were no changes in production costs between 1965 and 1966. The importation of paper has been entrusted to the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation and the prices of impor­ted goods are determined on the basis of the c.i.f. value plus duty, plus a small margin to cover overheads. The prices of corresponding products manufactured by the Corporation are fixed in relation to the imported items. A part of the profits arising from production is utilized to subsidise certain items such as exer­cise books, which are sold at prices controlled by the Government.

For the first time since the establishment of the plant, the Paranthan Chemi­cals Corporation has shown a profit of Rs. 190,000 in 1966 as against a loss of Rs. 208,487 in 1965. This was achieved despite a slight increase in the cost of production arising from the increase in the cost of raw materials. Factors influenc­ing profitability were increases in the output of edible table salt and chlorine. The Corporation was able to obtain a better price for caustic soda after the Govern­ment fixed the price of both the imported and locally manufactured products at Rs. 925 per ton. The profits of the National Salt Corporation in 1966 were esti­mated at Rs. 1-2 million. The prices of manufactured salt have been fixed by the Government at Rs. 4-50 per cwt. ex salterns, and Rs. 5-50 ex stores.

The profits of the Ceylon Ceramics Corporation at Rs. 623,741 in 1966 were approximately 20 per cent higher than in the previous year. The cost of product-tion increased by about 2 per cent due mainly to increases in wages and salaries after the introduction of a new wage and salary structure. There was also a slight in­crease in the cost of-imported raw materials owing to the delay in approving con­cessionary rates of import duties for these materials. The Corporation sold the bulk of its products on a commission basis to the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment while the latter distributes the products to Co-operative Multi­purpose Production and Sales Unions. From the inception, the selling prices of the Corporation's products have not changed. The finished ceramicware of the Corporation has always had a very ready sale and the demand has been appreci­ably above what the Corporation produces. In 1966 the Corporation produced only 40 per cent of the local requirements of crockery.

The profits of the Ceylon Leather Products Corporation after tax was Rs. 144,260 as against the profit of Rs. 257,600 in 1965. The fall in profits was due to an increase in the cost of production while selling prices have remained un­changed. The selling prices have been determined on a competitive basis and fixed in relation to the prices charged for footwear by other manufacturers. The increase in the turnover tax from 3 to 5 per cent has also affected profits. The rise in the cost of imported raw materials was due to an increase in customs duty from an average of 17 per cent to 30 per cent. There was also an upward revision in wages and salaries which increased costs.

The estimated profit of the National Textile Corporation in 1966 before tax was Rs. 1-4 million as against Rs. 1-6 million in 1965. In determining the selling price of its products the Corporation took into account'all costs and provided for an overall return of 10 per cent on investments. For the pricing of some pro­ducts the Corporation also took into account the selling prices of comparable imported items.

The cost of production of ilmenite by the Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation has remained more or less stable during the year. During the peak production months from March to August production costs normally tend to decline. But despite this, overall costs have not fallen because of increased expenditure on the maintenance of mining equipment. The profitability of the Corporation depends on the price of ilmenite which is beyond the control of the Corporation because the entire output is exported. The price of ilmenite has been static during the last few years and the output has been determined by weather conditions. In wet weather, production receives a severe setback. At present the market for ilmenite is almost entirely in Japan; the Corporation is exploring other market possibilities.

The Carpentry Section of the National Small Industries Corporation has been continuously running at a loss but during 1966 the loss was reduced to approximate­ly Rs. 550,000. Owing to serious technological problems the tile factories ran at a loss of Rs. 850,000 in 1966, whereas the Corporation anticipated that a profit would be realised. The Ayurveda Drugs Section made a profit of Rs. 100,000 last year. The overall position of .the Corporation was a loss of Rs. 800,000 during 1966.

( 64 )

The profitability of the Carpentry Section which produces furniture and boats depends mainly on the prices fixed by the Treasury on these items. The prices of bricks, tiles and drugs are determined with reference to prices obtaining in the market. In the Ayurveda Drugs Section, prices are fixed oh the basis of cost estimates and in relation to the prices of drugs supplied to Government Institutions where the Commissioner for Ayurveda is consulted. Sales to the public are at prices 10 to 20 per cent above those for Government and Local Government Institutions.

The profits of the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation after tax were approximately Rs. 450,000 ; profits in 1965 were higher at Rs. 518,211. The selling prices of the Corporation remained unchanged despite higher costs. The prices of fertilizers were determined on the basis of the e.i.f. price plus duty and charges to cover handling, storage and overheads. The Corporation has endeavoured to have stable prices by cushioning any increase or decrease in costs. Special prices are fixed for Government Institutions and Corporations who purchase in bulk.

The pricing policy of the Ceylon State Hardware Corporation in the initial stages of production has been to fix the prices of its products slightly below market prices.

Plans for Expansion

The current annual consumption of cement is about 300,000 tons of which, approximately 80,000 tons has been produced locally at the Kankesan Cement Works. Work was in progress for the expansion and modernization of the Kanke­san Cement Works with the object of increasing its annual output from 80,000 tons to 275,000 tons. The first stage of this programme costing Rs. 67 0 million was completed with the commissioning of the new kiln in 1966. During the year the terminal cement grinding and packing plant of the Ceylon Cement Corporation at Galle with an initial capacity of 100,000 tons per annum was completed. Work on the new cement making plant at Puttalam with an initial capacity of 220,000 tons was started and the plant is due for completion in 1969. The capital expen­diture on the first stage of the Puttalam Cement Factory would be approximately Rs. 81 million. The capital expenditure on the second stage designed to produce a further 220,000 tons will be approximately Rs. 61 million.

The scheme to extend the output of the paper mill of the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation from 3,750 to 9,000 tons was completed in 1966. The Corporation also proposes to start work in 1967 on the Paper Board Mill with a capacity of 9,000 tons to be located at Valaichchehai. A feasibility study for the erection of a newsprint mill up-country was also undertaken during the year. The possibility of .establishing a further fine paper mill was also being examined.

The Paranthan Chemicals Corporation proposes to commission in 1967 a hydrochloric acid plant to utilize approximately 400 tons of surplus chlorine. During the next five years, the Corporation also proposes to establish a plant to

( 6 5 )

step-up the output of caustic soda by 200 per cent to meet the entire local demand. Consideration has also been given to the establishment of a plant for the manu­facture of soda ash and ammonium chloride; the Corporation expects to export soda ash..

The commercial production of ceramicware at the new Piliyandala Factory of the Ceylon Ceramics Corporation started in December 1966 and the production of sanitaryware and wall tiles is expected to commence in 1967. The plans for the expansion of the kilns at the Negombo factory for the additional production of 160 tons of crockery and the insulator project for the production of 300 tons of insulators were examined during 1966. The Corporation in 1966 produced only about 40 per cent of the country's requirements of crockery. When the Piliyandala factory is in full production, the Corporation expects to meet the country's entire requirements of crockery. The possibilities for the export of refined kaolin were being examined so as to enable the Kaolin refinery to work at full capacity.

In 1967, preliminary work in connection with the integrated Cotton textile mill of the National Textile Corporation is expected to be completed. This mill when completed will have 113,000 spindles with a capacity of 17-4 million pounds of yarn per annum, 560 looms with a capacity of 14 million yards and 40 million yards finishing capacity per annum. The Corporation also proposes to set up in the future a Cotton Spinning and Weaving Mill under the Economic Aid Agreement with the People's Republic of China with 41,600 spindles and 700 looms with a capacity of 10 million yards per annum. In addition, a separate finishing plant with a capacity of 40 million yards is also being contemplated.

The Ceylon Leather Products Corporation undertook an evaluation of the tannery expansion project, and work on this is expected to commence in 1967 and will take about two years for completion. In 1966, the Corporation purchased machinery for the manufacture of a "cemented line" of footwear.

In order to eliminate lags in production resulting from bad weather, the Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation proposes to install a 20 ton sand drier which would function during the off season. The object of the Corporation has been to explore the .possibilities of processing heavy mineral sand, to obtain products other than ilmenite where the return tends to be higher. A ton of ilmenite sells for about Rs. 25 while rutile will sell at Rs. 500 and zircon at Rs. 340. The Corporation is in the process of setting up the rutile and zircon separation plant at China Bay at an estimated cost of Rs. 3 • 5 million. Production on a commercial scale is expected to commence around 1968.

The Ceylon Steel Corporation is planning to set up a steel foundry at a capital cost of Rs. 2-5.million in 1967 and a structural shop and Galvanizing plant at a cost of Rs. 2-8 million in 1968. The Corporation also hopes to establish a number of other subsidiary industries within the next few years to fully utilize the products

( 6 6 )

of the industry. The Ceylon State Hardware Corporation has taken steps to establish a cast-iron foundry.

The Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation started work in 1966 on the construction of a chain of District Fertilizer Stores at a cost of Rs. 5 million to be spread out over a period of 5 years. Action was also initiated during the year for the construction of a mixing plant estimated at Rs. 3 million.

The National Salt Corporation is now undertaking the expansion of the Ele­phant Pass and Puttalam Salterns and will shortly undertake the construction of a new Saltern at Chavakachcheri.
