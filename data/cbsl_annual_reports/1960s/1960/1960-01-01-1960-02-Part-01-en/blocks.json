This is faster than the rate at which population is estimated to have increased and represents, therefore, a modest improvement in real product per person. Yet, in the monetary field the year 1960 was one of crisis. As in the years immediately preceding, Ceylon's total outlay on consumption and investment exceeded her National product. In the Process, her external reserves continued to fall rapidly. By 1960, the decline in external reserves had gone so far that correc\u00adtive measures became imperative. From August 1960, onwards, following the formation of the new government, a series of such measures was introduced. These measures highlight Ceylon's experience in 1960 in the monetary and financial field.",

Thus, at present estimates, the relative shares of agricultural production (including exports) and services in the Gross Domestic Product were practically the same in 1960 as in 1948. In 1948 the shares of agricultural production and of services were approximately 62 per cent and 33 per cent respectively ; in 1960 they were 61 per cent and 33 per cent. The relative share of manufacturing industry to the total Gross Domestic Product, at constant prices, rose mildly from 5-0 per cent in 1948 to 5-6 per cent in 1960. But the absolute contribution of industry to the rise in total product has remained small. In fact, in absolute terms, it is the contribution of tea to the increase in Gross Domestic Product that has been notable. Ceylon's Gross Domestic Product at constant prices is estimated to have increased by Rs. 2,046 million between 1948 and 1960. Rs. 506 million, or 25 per cent of this total, represents an increase in tea production. This increase in tea output was due primarily to a raising of yields through the greater use of fertilizers.",

The particularly sharp increase in current expendi\u00adtures in 1958/59 was largely due to increased social service expenditure and transfer payments, mainly the food-subsidy. The high outlays in 1959/60, (and the provision for 1960/61) include an enhanced provision for food subsidies following the reduction in the price of rationed rice in April, 1960. The total food subsidy bill which was reduced from Rs. 131-6 million in 1950/51 to Rs. 12-5 million in 1953/54 increased thereafter once more to Rs. 105-5 million in 1956/57 and Rs. 193 million in 1959/60.

Over the period 1952/53 to 1959/60, for example, revenues rose from Rs. 952-5 million to 1,403-8 million representing an increase of 47-4 per cent. Yet these increases were outstripped by the rise in total expenditure. Further, the pattern of revenue in recent years indicates certain limitations in Ceylon's revenue structure. Expan\u00adsionist budgets generally result in an increase in national income in money terms ; given a responsive revenue system there should be related increases in accruals to Government.",

    "text": "The structure of government revenue is such, however, that whilst revenues tend to respond adequately to increases in national income caused by a rise in export earnings, they are less responsive to increases, which occur through other causes. There are essentially two reasons for this. First, the export duty is an effective instrument for channelling to revenue, proportions of increases in national income caused by rising export earnings. Second, the income tax and other direct taxes of Government tend themselves to be more responsive to changes in export earnings than to other changes. However, where the increase in national income, whether through Government spending or other causes, is more widely distributed, there does not arise spontaneously, a relative increase in revenue through direct taxes. This is one of the limitations of the revenue structure. Whilst levels of government expenditures may rise independantly of a rise in export earnings, some of the major sources of revenue tend to be closely dependent on the level of these earnings. Revenues from import duties, however, constitute an exception. As outlays on imports are an important part of consumer spending, revenues from import duties tend to be more responsive to income increases originating from a variety of sources. This would also be true of revenues from sales taxes and excise duties.",

The manner of financing is itself of relevance to the inflationary impact of the deficits. Deficits financed out of foreign borrowing, for example, are non-inflationary to the extent that the corresponding accruals of foreign exchange enable additional supplies of imports. Again, borrowing from non-bank sources tends to be less inflationary than Bank borrowing or the running down of cash balances. The last two sources strengthen the basis for further credit expansion by the banking system.",

Budgetary deficits, on account of their expansionist effects, tend to raise the cash and other liquid assets of the commercial banks. The capacity of the banks for credit creation is thereby strengthened. The deficits in the Balance of Payments on current account on the other hand, tend to weaken the liquidity position of the banks. It has, in fact been the usual experience of Ceylon that the Banks' liquid assets tend to fluctuate markedly with changes in the country's external balance\u2014rising when the balance of payments is favourable and vice versa. Since 1958, however, despite large deficits in the Balance of Payments on current account bank liquidity has actually improved. The total liquid assets of the banks rose from, a monthly average of Rs. 301 million in 1958 to Rs. 311 million in 1959 and Rs. 333 million in 1960. This improvement in bank liquidity, despite the Balance of Payments position, reflects the offsetting effects of the Government's budgetary deficits.",

On the other hand, j Ceylon's balance of merchandise trade is usually in surplus. When this surplus more than offsets the deficit in invisible items, external reserves tend to rise. During 1959 and 1960, however, the increase in imports was so rapid that the surplus on merchandise trade was replaced by an actual deficit. This result was particularly striking, since during these years total earnings from exports actually increased. It vividly illustrates the extent of the monetary and financial disequilibrium in Ceylon's economy.",

The best available approximation is the Colombo-Consumers' Price Index which is based on items entering into the pattern of working class con\u00adsumption in Colombo. This is not fully representative of the movements in general retail prices, not only because of its limited coverage but also because of the import\u00adance of subsidised items in the working class budget. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, movements in the consumers' price index shown below provide some indication of the course of retail prices in Ceylon :\u2014",

However, as agent of the Govern\u00adment in the management of the Public Debt it could not, as pointed out in the 1959 Report, \" abandon its role of co-operation with the Treasury to meet expenses as had been budgeted.\" The discussion in the preceding section has already indi\u00adcated the increasing extent to which there was recourse to the Central Bank for the financing of the budgetary deficits in recent years.

Measures directed towards a reduction of imports, whether introduced by the Government or the Central Bank, have to take account of a common problem. This arises out of the preponderance of essential items or necessities of mass con\u00adsumption in Ceylon's total import bill. It is natural that the main burden of the reduction in imports should fall on luxuries and relatively less essential goods. But in context of the pattern of Ceylon's imports, even drastic curbs on these categories\u2014 when these are narrowly defined\u2014will go only a limited way towards reducing the total import bill. The increase in imports in recent years, in fact, covered a wide range of goods extending well beyond what may be described as luxuries or inessen\u00adtials. Similar considerations apply to the magnitude of savings that would be possi\u00adble through exchange control on invisibles since these, too, constitute\u2014once transport and freight are excluded\u2014a relatively minor proportion of Ceylon's total outlays abroad.",

The inflationary consequences of import regulation through duties are distinctly less than through quantitative controls. Although, as mentioned, both devices tend to raise prices in the first instance, the major part of the price increases effected through higher import duties accrues to Government in the form of revenue. These accruals represent, therefore, a siphoning away of purchasing power and contribute towards a reduction in the budgetary gap itself. In the case of quantitative controls, on the other hand, the increase in prices brought about by the reduction in supplies result in windfall profits to those importers who have secured licences and deal in the com\u00admodities in scarce supply. To the extent that these additional incomes constitute further purchasing power they augment, cumulatively, the inflationary and expan\u00adsionist pressures in the economy. These considerations are of significance for policy. Where the need to reduce imports is urgent the use of the weapon of quantitative control is often inevitable. The inflationary consequences of this expedient may, however, be minimised through the simultaneous imposition of duties on the controlled items. In this way the magnitude of windfall profits to traders is reduced and a portion of the consumer outlay directed to Government revenue.",

    "text": "There are also some important considerations of relevance to monetary control by the Central Bank. As mentioned, the main instrument of action by the Central Bank is the control of the availability and cost of commercial bank credit to the private sector. Conventionally, the objective of monetary controls of this nature is to bring about equilibrium in the balance of payments by means of a general deflation in the economy and a reduction in total investment. Such a process is not, however, wholly appropriate for Ceylon. A general reduction of economic activity would react adversely not only on economic development but also on Ceylon's exports themselves. A curtailment in exports would in turn further aggravate the balance of payment problem, and thereby prove self-defeating. A more selective approach to credit control is therefore needed where emphasis is placed, as far as possible, on the direct reduction of credit for import\u2014particularly for the import of less essential items. This implies that it is necessary to introduce new varients of monetary weapons fashioned in accordance with this objective. These consider\u00adations guided the choice of the measures actually adopted by the Central Bank during 1960 as outlined in the pages to follow. It is important to emphasise, however, that in a changing situation it is not desirable to place reliance on selective controls alone. In accordance with the changing liquidity position of the banking system, these measures would need to be reinforced with controls of a more general character which restrict the base for credit expansion itself.",
