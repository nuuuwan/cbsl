In terms of the Labour Department classifica\u00adtion of reasons given for strikes the number of strikes resulting from a demand for wage increases continued to fall and was 1-9 per cent of the strikes in 1960.",

    "text": "In the last few years, particularly with the growth of the size of the budget deficit, Government's financial operations have become the most important influence on the money supply. This is in contrast to the period before 1958 when the balance of payments generally determined the movements of the money supply. Thus in 1960 the financing of the Government's budget deficit by bank credit, though smaller in magnitude than in the previous year was once again the predominant factor responsible for the rise in the money supply. This is seen in the table above from the increase in government paper held by the commercial banks and the Central Bank, increase in advances by the Central Bank to the Government, and the fall in Government cash balances. In 1960, commercial banks' holdings of government and government guaranteed securities and Treasury bills rose by Rs. 6-0 million as compared with a rise of Rs. 30-2 million in 1959, while Central Bank's advances to Government increased by Rs. 21-9 million as compared with a rise of Rs. 61-8",

    "text": "The budget deficit and the rise in commercial bank credit to the private sector did not exert their full expansionary effect on the money supply principally because of the contractive influence of the adverse balance of payments as reflected in the decline in the external banking assets. They fell by Rs. 170-2 million as against the fall of Rs. 195-0 million in 1959. Further, fixed and savings deposits and other liabilities increased by Rs. 72 \u2022 5 million. Nevertheless the money supply increased since the contractive factors only partly counteracted the expansionary factors. The slow growth of the money supply in 1960 as compared with the year before is partly due to the fall in the size of the Government's contribution to the money supply. It is also partly due to the increase of fixed deposits which reflects, as will be shown later, the increase in the rates of interest paid by commercial banks on these deposits in early 1960.",

    "text": "Reflecting the further deterioration in the balance of payments situation, the international reserve of the Central Bank fell by Rs. 196-5 million or 50 \u2022 8 per cent in 1960 as compared with the fall of Rs. 152 \u2022 0 million or 28 \u2022 2 per cent in 1959. Central Bank's domestic assets on the other hand increased appreciably particularly on account of its credit operations with the Government to finance the budget deficit. The Central Bank's advances to Government rose to Rs. 191 \u2022 3* million, an increase of Rs. 21 -9 million as compared to an increase of Rs. 61 -8 million in 1959, while its holdings of Treasury bills and Government securities rose by Rs. 224-3 million as compared to a rise of Rs. 191-0 million in 1959. Commercial banks were also obliged on account of their low reserve position to seek accommodation from the Central Bank particularly in the first nine months of the year . Hence Central Bank's advances to commercial banks increased by Rs. 21-0 million during the year. Since other assets and accounts fell by Rs. 46-3 million, total assets increased by Rs. 24-6 million.",
