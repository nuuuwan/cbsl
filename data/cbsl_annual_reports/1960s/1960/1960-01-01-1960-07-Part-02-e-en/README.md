million in 1959. On the other hand, Central Bank's holdings of Government securities and Treasury bills rose by Rs. 224-3 million as against a rise of Rs. 191-0 million in the previous year. Government rupee cash which had fallen by Rs. 64-0 million in 1959, fell by Rs. 8-0 million in I960- The net expansionary effect of Govern­ment's financial operations in 1960 was Rs. 260 • 2 million as compared with Rs.347 • 0 million in 1959. In 1960 commercial bank credit to the private sector also exerted a noteworthy expansionary influence as compared with the previous year. Thus bank credit which rose by only Rs. 9 • 7 million in 1959, increased by Rs. 31-5 million in 1960.

The budget deficit and the rise in commercial bank credit to the private sector did not exert their full expansionary effect on the money supply principally because of the contractive influence of the adverse balance of payments as reflected in the decline in the external banking assets. They fell by Rs. 170-2 million as against the fall of Rs. 195-0 million in 1959. Further, fixed and savings deposits and other liabilities increased by Rs. 72 • 5 million. Nevertheless the money supply increased since the contractive factors only partly counteracted the expansionary factors. The slow growth of the money supply in 1960 as compared with the year before is partly due to the fall in the size of the Government's contribution to the money supply. It is also partly due to the increase of fixed deposits which reflects, as will be shown later, the increase in the rates of interest paid by commercial banks on these deposits in early 1960.

(e) Banking and Credit (1) Central Bank

Reflecting the further deterioration in the balance of payments situation, the international reserve of the Central Bank fell by Rs. 196-5 million or 50 • 8 per cent in 1960 as compared with the fall of Rs. 152 • 0 million or 28 • 2 per cent in 1959. Central Bank's domestic assets on the other hand increased appreciably particularly on account of its credit operations with the Government to finance the budget deficit. The Central Bank's advances to Government rose to Rs. 191 • 3* million, an increase of Rs. 21 -9 million as compared to an increase of Rs. 61 -8 million in 1959, while its holdings of Treasury bills and Government securities rose by Rs. 224-3 million as compared to a rise of Rs. 191-0 million in 1959. Commercial banks were also obliged on account of their low reserve position to seek accommodation from the Central Bank particularly in the first nine months of the year . Hence Central Bank's advances to commercial banks increased by Rs. 21-0 million during the year. Since other assets and accounts fell by Rs. 46-3 million, total assets increased by Rs. 24-6 million.

The increase in the currency issue of the Central Bank was less marked in 1960 than in the previous year. The total issue rose by Rs. 23 • 3 million or 3 • 7 per cent as compared with a rise of Rs. 43 • 0 million or 7 • 4 per cent in 1959 • Commercial banks' deposits with the Central Bank increased by Rs. 44-9 million as against an increase of Rs. 3-9 million during 1959. This increase occurred in the last few months of the year reflecting an improvement of their liquidity position during this period. Deposits of international organisations and other liabilities fell by Rs. 15-1 million

•Includes the special loan of Es. 37 0 million in October. 1959, for the purpose of a payment to I.M.F.

( 5 4 )

and Rs. 32-6 million respectively. On account of the rise in total currency and demand liabilities and the fall in the international reserve, the ratio of the inter­national reserve to currency and demand liabilities fell further, from 48 • 2 per cent at the end of 1959 to 22 • 2 per cent at the end of 1960, the lowest level so far.

(2) Credit Policy

The main problem facing the Central Bank in 1960 was the rapid fall in the country's external assets. The Central Bank adopted a series of monetary measures in order to restrain commercial bank credit with a view to arrest the continuing fall in external assets. They were largely of a selective nature aimed at restricting bank credit and increasing the cost of credit given for the purchase and import of certain luxury and semi-luxury goods. Provision was also made for credits for essential trade and production purposes to be available on reasonable terms.

With effect from August 13, 1960, the commercial banks were required—

(a) to insist on 50 per cent cash margins against letters of credit for the import­

ation of certain goods. The banks were also requested not to grant advances for the purpose of providing these margins. In order to make this requirement more effective importers were also required to import these goods only on letters of credit;

(b) not to increase the amount of their advances as at August 12, 1960, for the

purpose of importing certain goods ;

(c) not to finance hire-purchase operations in respect of certain goods except

on the security of hire-purchase agreements resulting from the hire of such goods; such advances should not exceed either |. of the amount due by hirers to owners or J of the value of goods hired, under such agreements, whichever is less; and

(d) not to increase the amount of their advances for the purpose of purchase

of certain goods.

The goods* covered by (a) and (b) were : —

Air-conditioning equipment; alcoholic beverages, excluding beer, ale, stout, porter and other fermented cereal beverages; floor coverings and tapestries ; fountain pens and parts excluding nibs ; furniture and fixtures ; motor cars and station waggons; paper and paper-board ; perfumery ; cosmetics, soaps, and cleansing and polishing preparations; photographic and cinemato­graphic apparatus and appliances ; photographic and cinematographic supplies; exposed cinematographic films 35mm.; watches ; horses.

The goods covered by (c) and (d) were :—

Imported air-conditioning equipment, furniture and fixtures, motor cars and station waggons, photographic and cinematographic apparatus and appli­ances, photographic and cinematographic supplies, exposed cinematographic films 35 mm.

* ' Paper and paper-board ' were subsequently omitted.

( 5 5 )

With effect from August 13, 1900, the Central Bank increased its rate of interest

on advances to commercial banks secured by the pledge of government securities

from 2\ per cent to 4 per cent. However, in order that this increase may not

adversely affect the cost of commercial bank credit for essential trade and production

purposes, the Central Bank's lending rate to commercial banks against the pledge

of usance promissory notes relating to certain transactions was fixed at per

cent. These transactions']" were in respect of—

(a) the importation, purchase, storage or transportation within Ceylon of food,

textiles, cotton yarn, pharmaceutical products, fertilizers, and agri­

cultural implements;

(b) financing the production, manufacture or processing in Ceylon of agricul­

tural, animal, mineral or industrial products; and

{c) financing the purchase, storage or transportation within Ceylon of domestic­

ally produced goods and products.

At the same time the maximum rate of interest chargeable by banks for the

following advances was fixed at the rates obtaining on August 12 and in no case to

exceed 6 per cent:—

(«) advances granted for financing the purchase or storage of goods and products

(excluding imports) or the transportation within Ceylon of such goods

and products;

(b) advances granted for financing the production, manufacture or processing

in Ceylon of agricultural, animal, mineral or industrial products;

(c) advances granted for financing the importation, purchase, sale, transportation

and storage of the following categories of imports"]":—Food, textiles,

cotton yarn, pharmaceutical products, fertilizers and agricultural imple­

ments.

The above selective controls were strengthened by a further measure. With

effect from August 26, 1960, the commercial banks were required to increase their

statutory reserves with the Central Bank against demand deposits from 10 per cent

to 12 per cent. The reserve requirements against time and savings deposits remained

unchanged at 5 per cent.

(3) Commercial Banks

The Bank of Ceylon opened a new branch in Colombo, increasing its number

of offices in the city to seven. The number outside Colombo remained at twenty

five. The total number of bank offices in Ceylon at the end of the year was 45, of which 19 were in Colombo.

Total deposit liabilities of commercial banks increased from Rs. 993 • 1 million at the end of 1959 to Rs. 1,057-1 million at the end of 1960, an increase of Rs. 64-0 million as against an increase of Rs. 46-3 million in the previous year. Average deposits rose from Rs. 954 • 7 in 1959 to Rs. 997 • 6 in 1960. This increase was princip­ally on account of the rise in time deposits. Whereas average demand deposits increased by Rs. 2-8 million, and savings deposits by Rs. 11-4 million, time deposits rose by Rs. 28 • 7 million. The rise in time deposits in 1960 reflects on the one hand an increase in money incomes and on the other hand an increase in interest rates on time deposits paid by commercial banks. In March-April all the major commercial banks increased their rates on deposits for three to eleven months from 2 to 2J per cent.

The following table shows the ownership of deposits (excluding Government and inter-bank) at the end of September, 1959, March and September, 1960, based on the half-yearly survey conducted by the Central Bank :—

During the year ended September 30, 1960, total dejjosits increased by Rs. 83 -9 million principally on account of a rise in deposits of individuals by Rs. 37-5 million, trading Rs. 16-3 million, financial institutions Rs. 16-3 million, plantations Rs. 11 •() million.

The relative importance of the growth of time deposits referred to earlier is seen also in the above table showing data for the year ended September 30, 1959. It will be seen that except for local authorities this rise in time deposits is shared by each of the categories of holders. It should also be noted that the increase in time deposits occurred mainly after March, 1960, when all the major banks increased their rates paid on deposits.

In 1960, until the introduction of credit control measures by the Central Bank in August, commercial banks expanded credit to the private sector by reducing their holdings of liquid assets. In the first eight months of the year, loans and overdrafts increased while liquid assets including Treasury bills fell despite the rising yields on the latter. Investments in long-term government securities remained roughly unchanged during this period. After August, however, there was a fall in loans and overdrafts and a corresponding rise in liquid assets particularly cash and holdings of Treasury bills. Investments in government securities also increased slightly after August.

Cash on hand and with the Central Bank fell from Rs. 135-8 million at the end of 1959 to Rs. 109 • 1 million at the end of July but increased to Rs. 176-1 million at the end of the year while holdings of Treasury bills fell from Rs. 45-9 million at the end of 1959 to Rs. 6-5 million at the end of August, 1960, but rose to Rs. 47-9 million at the end of the year. It should be mentioned that the rise in cash with the Central Bank was partly due to a rise in required reserves following the increase in reserve ratio from the end of August. Average holdings of cash and Treasury bills in creased from Rs. 115-8 million and Rs. 24-2 million in 1959 to Rs. 131-8 million and Rs. 28-5 million respectively in 1960. The net increase in foreign balances in 1960 was Rs. 5-4 million while average holdings increased from Rs. 51 -7 million in 1959 to Rs. 57 • 7 million in 1960. Bills purchased and discounted however, fell from a monthly average of Rs. 119-4 million in 1959 to Rs. 114-7 million in 1960. Total liquid assets rose from an average of Rs. 311 -0 million in 1959 to Rs. 332-6 million in 1960 while the ratio of liquid assets to demand deposits increased from an average of 47 • 5 per cent to 50 • 7 per cent in the same period.

Excess reserves which were low in the first eight months of 1960 also increased sharply in the four month period beginning September, reflecting partly the effect of the monetary measures adopted by the Central Bank in August which induced banks to cut down on certain types of credits. Thus the excess reserves which stood at Rs. 1 • 4 million at the end of July rose to Rs. 6 • 3 million at the end of August and Rs. 22-0 million at the end of September and to Rs. 39-5 million at the end of the year. The average level of excess reserves was Rs. 12-9 million in 1960 as compared with Rs. 4; 7 million in 1959.

Owing to their low reserve position many banks borrowed from the Central Bank in the first eight months of 1960. In the remaining period however, during which their excess reserves increased, only one or two banks borrowed from the

( 59 )

Central Bank. Yet the average amount of indebtedness during the latter period

was higher than the average during the previous eight months. After August, I960,

banks borrowed chiefly against the security of usance promissory notes at the con­

cessionary rate of 2£ per cent. Total loans outstanding increased from a monthly

average of Rs. 5 • 8 million in 1959 to Rs. 13 • 0 million in 1960.

Inter-bank borrowing (among commercial banks) remained at a high level in

1960, although the monthly average of loans outstanding was lower than in the

previous year—Rs. 23-8 million in 1960 against Rs. 29-2 million in 1959. It

should be noted that the amount of inter-bank indebtedness was less after August

than during the previous months of 1960. Reflecting the high level of inter-bank

borrowing under tight money conditions, the inter-bank call loan rate increased by

\ per cent to 1 f per cent in April. It rose again in August by J per cent to 2i per cent

as a part of the general rise in banks' advance rates following the increase in Central

Bank's rate on the pledge of Government securities but fell in October to 2 per cent

because of the subsequent improvement in the banks' reserve position.

Commercial banks' loans and overdrafts rose from a monthly average of Rs. 395 • 4

million in 1959 to Rs. 429-7 million in 1960. As mentioned earlier the increase

in advances occurred in the first nine months of the year. The total advances

increased by Rs. 48-2 million, from Rs. 508-7 million at the end of December, 1959

to Rs. 556-9 million at the end of August. In September they rose slightly to

Rs. 557-7 million but fell thereafter to Rs. 543-9 million, at the end of the year,

reflecting the impact of the credit control measures of the Central Bank in August.

The average ratio of loans and overdrafts to total deposits rose from 41 -4 per cent

in 1959 to 43 • 1 per cent in 1960.

As a result of the monetary measures there was also a significant change in the

composition of advances. After August several banks converted overdrafts into

loans to enable themselves to borrow if necessary from the Central Bank in terms of

Section 82(1) of the Monetary Law Act, at the concessionary rate of 2 | per cent

against usance promissory notes. There was no significant change in investments

in government securities. This is because the increase in the demand for credit

by the private sector in the first eight months of the year was met by reducing

banks' liquid assets and not holdings of government securities. They fell from

Rs. 283-5 million at the beginning of the year to Rs. 282-0 million at the

end of September but rose to Rs. 287 • 5 million at the end of the year. The monthly

average of these holdings fell from Rs. 284-6 million in 1959 to Rs. 284-2 million

in 1960. The ratio of investments to total deposits also fell from 29-8 per cent

to 28-5 per cent.

* Advances include loans, overdrafts and bills discounted.

During the year ended September, 30 1960, total bank advances increased

by Rs. 33 • 0 million. This increase was mainly for commercial and financial purposes.

Advances for commerce which rose by a total of Rs. 5 • 5 million was, as in the previous

year, principally for import trading; while advances for export trading fell by

Rs. 4-6 million, those for import trading rose by Rs. 9-4 million. Advances for

financial purposes increased by Rs. 25 • 6 million and consisted chiefly of loans to

hire-purchase companies. Advances for consumption and agriculture also rose

by Rs. 4 • 1 million and Rs. 0 • 1 million respectively but those for industrial purposes

mainly engineering and building trades, fell by Rs. 4 • 2 million.

In this period the advances given for commerce as a ratio of total advances

fell from 71-9 per cent to 68-7 per cent despite the increase in advances in this

category, while the ratio of financial advances to total advances rose from 14-4
