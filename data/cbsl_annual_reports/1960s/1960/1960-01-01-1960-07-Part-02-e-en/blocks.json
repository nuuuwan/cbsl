    "text": "The budget deficit and the rise in commercial bank credit to the private sector did not exert their full expansionary effect on the money supply principally because of the contractive influence of the adverse balance of payments as reflected in the decline in the external banking assets. They fell by Rs. 170-2 million as against the fall of Rs. 195-0 million in 1959. Further, fixed and savings deposits and other liabilities increased by Rs. 72 \u2022 5 million. Nevertheless the money supply increased since the contractive factors only partly counteracted the expansionary factors. The slow growth of the money supply in 1960 as compared with the year before is partly due to the fall in the size of the Government's contribution to the money supply. It is also partly due to the increase of fixed deposits which reflects, as will be shown later, the increase in the rates of interest paid by commercial banks on these deposits in early 1960.",

Average deposits rose from Rs. 954 \u2022 7 in 1959 to Rs. 997 \u2022 6 in 1960. This increase was princip\u00adally on account of the rise in time deposits. Whereas average demand deposits increased by Rs. 2-8 million, and savings deposits by Rs. 11-4 million, time deposits rose by Rs. 28 \u2022 7 million. The rise in time deposits in 1960 reflects on the one hand an increase in money incomes and on the other hand an increase in interest rates on time deposits paid by commercial banks. In March-April all the major commercial banks increased their rates on deposits for three to eleven months from 2 to 2J per cent.",

Investments in long-term government securities remained roughly unchanged during this period. After August, however, there was a fall in loans and overdrafts and a corresponding rise in liquid assets particularly cash and holdings of Treasury bills.
