The price of tea (annual average) declined slightly, continuing the slow downward trend that first appeared after the boom prices of 1955. In each of the last three years the price of tea has fallen by a little over 1 per cent. The contribution of rubber to export receipts in 1960 increased by Rs. 80 million as against an increased contribution of Rs. 50 million from tea. The increase in export receipts from rubber was due to a rise in price (11 per cent) and an increase in volume (14 percent). The value of exports of the three major coconut products declined in contrast by Rs. 60 million as a result of falls both in the amount exported (13 per cent) and in price (13 per cent).",

The volume of imports which had increased by 12 per cent in 1959 declined by a little over 4 per cent in 1960. But up to the third quarter of 1960 there were no indications that the volume of imports would drop below the level of 1959. On the contrary the indica\u00adtions were that this level could be exceeded by a considerable margin. Thus during the third quarter the volume of imports was already running at a rate about 12 per cent above the annual rate in 1959. In certain categories of imports, in particular the consumer goods group such as textiles and other consumer goods, the volumes of imports gave considerable support to the belief that substantial stocks were being built up. Tariff measures, import and credit restrictions introduced towards the end of the third quarter, however, resulted in the marked diminution of these categories of consumer goods imports. In the final quarter of the year the category most affected by these measures viz., \" other consumer goods \" contracted by 39 per cent.",

    "text": "The average f.o.b. price of Ceylon tea declined from Rs. 2 \u2022 72 per pound in 1959 to Rs 2-67 per pound in 1960. However, the average Colombo auction price of all teas increased from Rs. 1 -85 per pound in 1959 to Rs. 1 -88 per pound in 1960. This improvement was partly a result of the impact of the ad valorem duty on the lower priced teas particularly those in medium grown and low grown categories. In contrast the Colombo auction price per pound of high grown teas declined from Rs. 2-13 in 1959 to Rs. 2-03 in 1960 as the higher priced teas attracted a higher aggregate duty.",

Thereafter, a sharp decline in prices commenced and this trend continued nearly without interruption till the end of the year.

    "text": "Coconut Products.\u2014The contraction in the world production of coconuts which first began early in 1957 continued throughout 1958 till nearly the end of 1959. By 1960, however, the supply pattern had undergone a marked improvement and Malayan and Philippine copra and oil were becoming increasingly available in the world's markets. The increase in supply of coconuts coincided with the general increase in the availanility of the world's fats and oils, particularly of soyabean oil. The demand for these products, however, in 1960 did not appear to increase by any significant margin. Consequently the price of coconut products which had been sustained previously at high levels dropped rapidly throughout the year. The Central Bank's trade indices for the three major coconut products indicate that the export price index for this group was 128 (1948 ==100) for the first quarter of 1960 but dropped continuously (by 28 per cent) to 92 in the last quarter of 1960. In 1960, as compared with 1959, the fall in the price of coconut oil was sharpest; the declines in the prices of copra and desiccated coconut were proportionately less, and whereas the amount of coconut oil exported contracted, there was an increase of 5 per cent in the amount of desiccated coconut exported.",

Imports from China declined from Rs. 150\"0 million in 1959 to Rs. 132-4 million in 1960. The decline was due largely to a fall in the amount of rice imported. Imports other than rice included textiles and certain foodstuffs. Imports of textiles from China have increased again in 1960 and now China is the third largest supplier of textiles to Ceylon ranking after Japan and India.",
