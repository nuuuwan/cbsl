II. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL TRENDS—1960

(a) National Product and Income

Gross National Product for 1960 at current factor cost prices has been provision­ally estimated at Rs. 5,932 million. In money terms there has been an increase of 4-4 per cent over the previous year while in real terms the rise was 3-8 per cent. When allowance is made for the growth of population, which according to provisional estimates shows an increase of 2 • 6 per cent, the rise in per capita real product was 1 • 2 per cent.

The growth of real product in 1960 reflects largely a rise in the volume of exports and was helped by small increases in the other sectors of the economy.

The movements in the main components of Gross National Product at current factor cost prices are shown in the following table :—

* Gross National Product at factor cost represents the value of the product accruing to factors of production. It differs from Gross National Product at market prices in that it excludes indirect taxes net of subsidies.

Although the prices of export products and of imported goods stood at the same level as in the previous year, there were changes in the cost of living index which fell by 1 • 6 per cent mainly on account of the reduction in the price of subsidised rice. In fact the price level of domestically produced and consumed goods rose by 0-8 per cent, and the prices of imported items other than rice, flour and sugar showed an increase of 3-6 per cent. The estimates of Gross National Product as corrected for such variations, i.e. the movements of Gross National Product at constant (1956) prices, are presented in the following table :—

*The deflators used in arriving at Gross National Product at constant prices include indices of export price, import price and various components of the import price, cost of living and its sub-groups and the wage rates.

Exports

The value of exports net of import content rose by 5-4 per cent in 1960. The rate of growth in exports in 1960 was almost twice that in 1959. The volume index of exports rose by 5-0 per cent and there was no change in export prices in 1960 as compared to 1959. The rise in exports has been the most important single cause of the rise in GNP both in money terms as well as in real terms. The export value of merchandise comprised 29-2 per cent of GNP in 1960.

Tea.—The acreage under tea at the end of 1960 was nearly 581,821 acres while it was 579,652 acres at the end of 1959. The total quantity of tea produced in 1960 is estimated at 435 million pounds as against 413 million pounds in 1959. The biggest increase was registered in the production of high grown teas which rose from 164 million pounds in 1959 to 176 million pounds in 1960. The average yield per acre has increased from 713 pounds in 1959 to 748 pounds in 1960.

It is expected that nearly 50,000 acres of tea will be replanted with high yielding varieties during the ten year period 1959 to 1968 under the Tea Replanting Subsidy Scheme recommended in the Ten Year Plan and introduced in 1959. The area replanted in 1959 was about 319 acres while in 1960 it was 882 acres.f1) It is estimated that with the extension of the use of fertilizers and the coming into bearing of the 50,000 acres replanted, the production of Ceylon tea is likely to rise by 75 million pounds. Whilst this Replanting Subsidy Scheme is intended to apply to large

(J) Estimates according to Tea Control Department.

estates (over 100 acres), the Tea Rehabilitation Subsidy Scheme which also came into 1

operation in 1959 aims at helping the small-holders to improve the productive

capacity of the holdings by the application of fertilizers, improvement of soil con- '

servation measures, etc. During the period 1959 to 1968 nearly 60,000 acres are

expected to be rehabilitated so as to raise production by a further 12 million pounds.

The total exports of tea showed an increase of 7 - 0 per cent in volume from 384

million pounds in 1959 to 410 million pounds in 1960. On account of a fall of nearly

2-2 per cent in price, however, the rise in value was only 4-8 per cent. !

Rubber.—The acreage under rubber showed only a very slight increase of a few

acres from 668,178 acres in 1959 to 668,213 acres in 1960. The Rubber Replanting

Subsidy Scheme launched in 1953 aims at replanting nearly 200 thousand acres of

uneconomic rubber land by the end of 1962. At the end of 1960, the area replanted

amounted to 149,350 acres, of which 16,190 acres were replanted in 1960. It is

estimated that when the entire area so replanted comes into bearing the total

production of rubber would increase by almost 60 per cent.

There was a rise in the production of rubber from 205 million pounds in 1959 to

218 million pounds in 1960. The average yield per acre, after allowing for an acreage

of nearly 20 per cent of the total still untapped, rose from 384 pounds in 1959 to

nearly 408 pounds in 1960.

The volume of rubber exported in 1960 was 235 million pounds as compared to

206 million pounds in 1959. The value realised from these exports rose 27 per cent

as a result of a rise in price of 12 per cent and a 14 per cent rise in volume.

Coconut.—The production of coconuts for 1960 is estimated at 2,220 million

nuts as compared to 2,314 million nuts in 1959. This estimated production figure

consists of the nut equivalent of total domestic consumption (estimated at 1,244

million nuts) and exports (976 million nuts). Data on the size and movement of

stocks are not available. Variations in exports therefore largely determine the

variations in production figures.

The use of fertilizers showed only a moderate increase in 1960 as compared to

1959. In 1960 nearly 44,000 tons of fertilizers compared to 40,000 tons in 1959

were distributed.

The total exports of the three major coconut products in terms of copra showed

a decrease of 14 per cent in volume. The value realised (Rs. 184 million) was 25

per cent lower than in 1959 due to this factor as well as to a 13 per cent fall in

prices (as indicated by the export price index of the three major coconut products.)

Exports and Terms of Trade

The importance of changes in the terms of trade on the real National Income

of Ceylon and their movements in relation to the major products are shown in the

following table :—

It can be seen that the terms of trade contribution to National Product has

been about 0-7 per cent in 1960 and was only slightly above the 1959 level. A

rise in real income due to a favourable terms of trade is a potential source of

capital formation. As it will be shown later the rise in real income in 1960 was

utilized largely for consumption purposes.

Includes income accruing to industry as a result of tea and rubber manufacturing.

Agriculture

Although the total value of agricultural production increased in 1960 its share

in the Gross Domestic Product, which had been declining at an annual rate of nearly-

one per cent since 1956, fell further from 48 per cent of GDP in 1959 to 47-5 per

cent. There was a marked increase in the growth of secondary industry mainly as

a result of higher activity in manufacturing and in construction.

The rise in the value of agricultural output by 3 - 5 per cent in 1960 over the pre­

ceding year was due to a combination of many factors. Better methods of cultiva­

tion, expansion in cultivated area, increase in yields and a slight increase in domestic

prices have contributed to this rise.

( 29 )

Paddy.—The production ngures for 1960 are provisionally estimated at 36-5 million bushels. This is an increase over 1959 by nearly 1 million bushels. The output for the Maha season increased from 21-6 million bushels in 1959 to 22 million bushels in 1960 while the Yala output rose from 14-2 million bushels to 14-5 million bushels over the same period. The average Maha season yield was 35-0 bushels per acre in 1959/60 and was slightly higher than the yield in 1958/59 which was 34-8 bushels per acre. The average yield in the Yala season also rose from 37-1 bushels per acre to 38-2 bushels per acre according to provisional estimates. Some factors that have been responsible for the rise in yields were the increased use of fertilizers and the use of seed paddy with high response to fertilizers and disease resisting varieties.

The production of paddy in terms of rice(1) was 509-7 thousand tons in 1960 as compared to 497 • 1 thousand tons in 1959. The domestic consumption of rice is estimated at 1,008 thousand tons.(2) It is clear that with the rapid increase in population a large proportion of domestic requirements of rice will have to be imported until such time as local paddy production meets domestic requirements and then rises faster than the rise in consumption. In 1960, rice imports amounted to 520 thousand tons.

Manufacturing and Handicrafts

Income originating in manufacturing and handicrafts was 6 • 4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product in 1960 as compared to 6-1 per cent in 1959. During the last three years the share of industrial production in Gross Domestic Product has expanded at an annual rate of nearly 0-4 per cent. The movements of the main components of industrial production entering into Gross Domestic Product are shown in the following table : —

Consumption Expenditure.—Total consumption expenditure in 1960 showed an increase of 6-3 per cent at current market prices and 5-4 per cent at current factor cost prices. In real terms the increase over the same period was 4-3 per cent at market prices and nearly 4 • 7 per cent at factor cost prices.

Government consumption expenditure which has been steadily increasing rose nearly 4 per cent in 1960 over the preceding year. Its relative importance as a proportion of GNP was nearly 15 per cent in 1960. In real terms, however, govern­ment consumption expenditure has risen 5 • 8 per cent over the same period.

In 1960 private consumption expenditure at current factor cost prices showed an increase of 5-7 per cent in money terms and 4*5 per cent in real terms over the last year. At market prices the rise in private consumption was 6-8 per cent in

( 32 )

money terms while in real terms it rose 4-0 per cent over the same period. The rise in private consumption was more than the rise in Gross National Product thus indicating a rise in the share of consumption in Gross National Product. Consumer 'expenditure is influenced not only by current incomes, but also by incomes of the immediate past, on asset and debt position of households, as well as by demographic and other factors. The rise in private consumption expenditure has been the main cause for internal demand exceeding GNP as indicated by the following table :—

Source : Central Bank of Ceylon.

The above table shows that total demand exceeded Gross National Product by 3-0 per cent in 1959 and 3-4 per cent in 1960. This indicates that Ceylon has continued to live beyond its income. Such a continuous feature should be viewed with.spme concern, at the present stage of Ceylon'seconomic development.

Gross Capital Formation.—The provisional estimates of gross capital formation at current.market prices show an increase of 2• 8 per cent from Rs. 865 million in 1959 to Rs. 889 million in 1960. Gross private capital formation in 1960 stood almost at the same level as in 1959 while the entire increase in gross capital forma­tion was borne by the public sector. It should be mentioned here that investments by government sponsored corporations have been treated as capital formation falling within the private sector, as mentioned previously.

As a percentage of GNP, gross capital formation at current market prices fell from 14*4 per cent in 1959 to 14-0 per cent in 1960. The proportion of private construction in gross private capital formation was 50 per cent. Private invest­ments on buildings, imported machinery and transport equipment indicated a slight drop in 1960.

When allowance is made for depreciation net capital formation forms nearly . 9 per cent of GNP. The method of arriving at depreciation estimates was explained ion the Annual Report for 1959. The depreciation estimate for 1960 was Rs. 323 million as compared to Rs. 312 million for 1959,

The estimates of personal savings are residual estimates derived from national income accounts. Government savings have been adjusted on a calendar year basis. Data on stocks are also residual estimates derived from the gross capital formation account. The estimates of personal and corporate savings indicate a fall of nearly 11 per cent in 1960 over the previous year.

The disposable private income was 92 per cent of national income in I960. This figure, however, includes undistributed corporate profits which in 1959 was less than 2 per cent of national income. Personal consumption in 1960 was nearly 90 per cent of disposable private income (after making a rough allowance for undistributed corporate profits).

The above table indicates that there has been actually a deepening of dependence

on imported consumption goods and investment goods. Though there has been a

growth in domestic production that enters into consumption there has not been a

deepening of production sufficient to meet the internal demand. In the context of

the liberal import policy that prevailed until the second half of the year there was

a great increase in consumption which was met through imports of consumer goods.

The high import content of consumption expenditure is partly a reflection of Ceylon's

dependence on imported consumption goods. The growth of import competing

substitutes has been at a lower rate than the growth in consumption expenditure.

The import component of consumption expenditure shows a rise from 37-0

per cent in 1959 to 37-7 per cent in 1960. The import component of investment

expenditure was 31-6 per cent in 1960 as compared to 30-2 per cent in 1959. The

rise in the import component of investment goods was due to an expansion in

imports of transport equipment and machinery.

Table II—12 shows the distribution of GDP as between the main uses. Of the total domestic resources used in 1960, 56-3 per cent was applied to the production for consumption (private and public), 9-5 per cent to the production for investment and 34-2 per cent to the production for exports.

Expenditure and Supplies

The following table summarises the changes in the expenditure and supplies :—•

The composition of additional resources and their uses can be seen from the Table 11—14.

In absolute real terms the increase in available supplies was Rs. 264 million. Of the additional supplies available in 1960 nearly 70-1 per cent was utilized for private consumption, 17-8 per cent for government consumption, 10-6 per cent

( 36 )

for gross capital formation and 1 • 5 per cent for exports of goods and services. This reflects again Ceylon's high marginal propensity to consume.

In view'of the rapid rate of growth in population it is necessary to translate these data on expenditure and supplies into per capita terms and observe their movements.

Per Capita Movements

The per capita movements in the main components of expenditure and supplies are shown in the table given below :—

In 1960 the per capita income at current prices was Rs. 600 as compared to Rs. 584 in 1959.

The growth of real product per head has been 1 • 2 per cent over the preceding year. During the last five years the rate of growth has averaged about one per cent. The growth rate in 1960 is even slightly lower than that experienced during the previous year and falls short of a desired level of growth for an underdeveloped country like Ceylon.
