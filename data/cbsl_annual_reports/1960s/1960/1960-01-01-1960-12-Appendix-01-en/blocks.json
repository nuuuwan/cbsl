The Acts provided also that where these advances had not been refunded to the Consolidated Fund out of the proceeds of loans to be raised under any written law, the balance of the advance was chargeable as if it were expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund for the service of a financial year five years later, in addition to any sum that was payable for the service of that financial year. This procedure has been dispensed with in 1960 and the Appropriation Act of 1960 authorised estimated expenditure for the service of the financial year 1960-61 to be met from (a) payments out of the Consolidated Fund or other Government funds ; and (b) from loans to be raised either in or outside Ceylon so that the aggregate proceeds of such loans do not exceed Rs. 470 million. Under the new procedure both current and capital expenditure will be met from current revenue and the proceeds of loans raised within the year.\"",
