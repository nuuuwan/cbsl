(Date of Assent: December 20, 1960) Be it enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Representatives of Ceylon in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :—

1. Short Title.—This Act may be cited as the Appropriation Act, No. 6 of 1960.

2. Appropriation for financial year, 1960-61.—(1) Without prejudice to any other law authorising any expenditure, the expenditure of the Government, which it is estimated will be rupees one thousand eight hundred and forty-three million five hundred and fifty-nine thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, for the service of the financial year which began on October 1, 1960, and ends on September 30, 1961, shall be met—

(6) from the proceeds of loans which are hereby authorised to be raised, whether in or outside Ceylon, for and on behalf of the Government, so however, that the aggre­gate of such proceeds do not exceed rupees four hundred and seventy million.

The sum of rupees one thousand eight hundred and forty-three million five hundred and fifty-nine thousand eight hundred and fifty-four hereinbefore referred to may be expended as specified in the First Schedule to this Act.

(2)' The provisions of sub-section (1) of this section shall be without prejudice to the provi­sions of any other written law authorising the raising of loans for and on behalf of the Government.

3. Financial provision in respect of certain activities of the Government for the financial year, 1960-61.—(1) The receipts of the Government, during the financial year referred to in section 2, from each activity specified in column 1 of the Second Schedule to this Act shall be credited to the account of such activity, but the aggregate of the receipts so credited shall not exceed the maximum limit specified in the corresponding entry in column III of that Schedule. Any receipts from such activity in excess of such maximum limit shall be credited to the Consolidated Fund of Ceylon.

(2) The expenditure incurred by the Government, during the financial year referred to in section 2, on each activity specified in column I of the Second Schedule to this Act shall be paid out of the receipts of the Government from such activity during that financial year, but such expenditure shall not exceed the maximum limit specified in the corresponding entry in column II of that Schedule.

(3) The debit balance, outstanding at the end of the financial year referred to in section 2, of any activity specified in column I of the Second Schedule to this Act shall not exceed the maximum limit specified in the corresponding entry in column IV of that Schedule, and the total liabilities of that activity at the end of that financial year shall not exceed the maximum limit specified in the corresponding entry in column V of that Schedule.

4.

Any sums so advanced in respect of such activity shall be refunded to that Consolidated Fund in such manner as the Minister of Finance may by Order direct.

o. Pow^r to transfer unexpended moneys from one vote to another vote under the same head of expenditure.—Any moneys which, by virtue of the provisions of the First Schedule to this Act, have been allocated to any vote other than votes Nos. 3, 5 and 7 appearing under any head specified in that Schedule but have not been expended and are not likely to be expended may be transferred to any other vote under that head by order of the Secretary to the Treasury or other officer authorised by him.

( 86 )

6. Power of Minister of Finance to vary the maximum limits specified in the Second Schedule to this Act.—The Minister of Finance, with the approval of the Government, may by Order vary or alter any of the maximum limits specified in column II, column III, column IV or column V of the Second Schedule to this Act.

7. Certain expenditure and advances to be deemed to have been incurred and made, respectively, under the authority of this Act and certain moneys to be included in the First Schedule of this Act.—• Notwithstanding anything in the resolution making financial provision for the service of the period which commenced on October 1, 1960, and ended on the day immediately prior to the date of the commencement of this Act passed by the House of Representatives on the twenty-eighth day of September, 1960,—

(a) any sums which have been expended during that period from moneys allocated by

that resolution to any vote appearing under any head specified in the First Schedule to that resolution shall be deemed, for all purposes, not to have been expended under the authority of that resolution but to have been expended under the authority of this Act; (b) any moneys so allocated which have not been expended on the day immediately prior

to the date of the commencement of this Act shall be deemed, for all purposes, to be included in the moneys allocated to such corresponding vote appearing under such corresponding head ; and

(c) any sums paid, by way of advances, out of the Consolidated Fund of Ceylon, during

that period, in respect of the services specified in the Second Schedule to that resolution shall be deemed, for all purposes, not to have been so advanced under the authority of that resolution but to have been so advanced under the authority of this Act.

NOTE—APPROPRIATION ACT OF 1960

" Prior to 1960 it had been the practice for Appropriation Acts to authorise the payment out of the Consolidated Fund of sums required for Loan Fund expenditure. The Acts provided also that where these advances had not been refunded to the Consolidated Fund out of the proceeds of loans to be raised under any written law, the balance of the advance was chargeable as if it were expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund for the service of a financial year five years later, in addition to any sum that was payable for the service of that financial year. This procedure has been dispensed with in 1960 and the Appropriation Act of 1960 authorised estimated expenditure for the service of the financial year 1960-61 to be met from (a) payments out of the Consolidated Fund or other Government funds ; and (b) from loans to be raised either in or outside Ceylon so that the aggregate proceeds of such loans do not exceed Rs. 470 million. Under the new procedure both current and capital expenditure will be met from current revenue and the proceeds of loans raised within the year."

A novel feature of the Act is that the different categories of Government activity have been classified under three broad categories—Administration, Social Services and Economic Develop­ment.

(iii) Circular No. 11.

Central Bank of Ceylon,

COMMERCIAL BANK CREDIT

In view of the continuing decline in Ceylon's external assets in the recent past, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank has decided to adopt monetary measures under the provisions of Part 7 of Chapter V of the Monetary Law Act in order to conserve as far as possible for essential purposes the foreign exchange reserves available to the country.

2. These measures are designed to discourage the importation of certain goods, by—

(a) an insistence on minimum margin requirements for import letters of credit;

and

(b) a restraint on the expansion of bank credit.

3. The Monetary Board has accordingly made the following orders for compliance by commercial banks .

(A) Margin requirements against Letters of Credit

With effect from August 13, 1960 letters of credit should not be opened by commercial banks for the importation of the goods of the description furnished in Schedule A attached unless such credits are covered by margins deposited in cash with the credit opening banks at the time such credits are opened in the proportions specified against each of the goods in the Schedule referred to.

In the case of existing letters of credit covering the importation of the goods mentioned in Schedule A no increase in the value of such letters of credit should be permitted by banks except on the terms prescribed in the above paragraph.

The Central Bank requests that commercial banks should not grant any advance or advances for the purpose of providing the minimum margins required to be deposited in terms of the above.

(B) Limitation on advances by Commercial Banks

1. With effect from August 13, 1960 commercial banks should not increase the amount of their advances as at the date of this Circular for the following specified purpose, namely, the purpose of financing the importation into Ceylon of any of the goods of the description furnished in Schedule A.

Where overdraft facilities have already been given for the purpose specified above, such facilities will continue until they expire.

2. As from August 13, 1960 advances for the purpose of financing hire purchase operations in respect of the hire of the goods of the description furnished in Schedule B attached should be granted by commercial banks only on the security of a deposit, pledge, mortgage, lien, assignment or hypothecation of hire purchase agreements, resulting from the hire of such goods. Such advances should not exceed either 33 1 /3% of the amount due by hirers to owners under such agreements or 25% of the value of goods hired under such agreements whichever is less.

( 90 )

Where overdraft facilities have been given for the purpose referred to above on the security of such hire purchase agreements, banks are requested to make arrangements with their customers in order to ensure that advances under these facilities do not exceed the security margins specified above. In doing so, banks should make due allowance for outstanding cheques of their customers. BET

Where overdraft facilities have been given for the purpose referred to above other than on the security of such hire purchase agreements as are referred to above, banks should, in enforcing the provisions of sub-paragraph 1 of this paragraph, take into account outstanding cheques of their customers.

3. With effect from August 13, 1960 commercial banks should not increase the amount of their advances for the following specified purpose, namely, the purpose of financing the purchase of any of the goods of the description furnished in Schedule B attached.
