The decline in the estimate is due to the fact that loans to Government agencies which in 1959/60 amounted to Rs. 56' 1 million have been estimated at Rs. 19 4 million. Estimated direct expenditure by Government on acquisition, construction and maintenance of real assets shows an increase from Rs. 469 \u2022 7 million in 1959/60 to Rs. 503 \u2022 5 million. The estimate of Rs. 503 \u2022 5 million for 1960/61 may be expected to be realised as it has been arrived at after allowing for a 25 per cent under-expenditure on all capital projects.",

The further small deterioration in the current account balance in 1960 was due to an increased deficit on merchandise account resulting from the continued rise in import payments. The merchandise deficit in 1960 was Rs. 94 million as compared with Rs. 81 million in 1959. In contrast there was a small improvement in the balance on invisible transactions with the deficit declining from Rs. 127 million to Rs. 115 million.",

    "text": "A recurrent deficit on invisibles account has been a normal feature of the Ceylon's balance of payments. A rational pattern for the merchandise balance, for a country with fluctuating export earnings and a recurrent deficit on invisible account would be for it to show a relatively large surplus in years when export earnings are high, and either a smaller surplus or a deficit in years when export earnings are low. The large merchandise deficits of 1959 and 1960 were however incurred at a time when export earnings have been relatively high, while import prices have been relatively low, in comparison with the immediately preceding years. Export earnings in 1960 were in fact higher than in any previous year except 1955 which was favoured by a sharp tea boom ; export earnings in 1959 were not much lower. Also the import price in 1959 and 1960 was 6 per cent lower than the average import price over the 10 years from 1950 to 1960. The continued increase in import payments, which was responsible for the merchandise account deficits even in 1959 and 1960, was directly the result of the sustained inflationary pressures generated in the economy, primarily through the budget deficits.",

    "text": "The small improvement in the adverse balance on invisibles account in 1960 was mainly due to the substantial drop in private remittances and migrants' transfers from Rs. 85-4 million in 1958 and Rs. 63-5 million in 1959 to Rs. 38-6 million in 1960. The contraction in this item was the direct result of the successive measures taken in 1959 and 1960 to restrict such remittances. A decline in the expenditures on foreign travel (as a result of tightening of exchange control on travel) and on transportation and insurance (as a result mainly of a decline in freight rates) was another factor which contributed to the improvement on invisible account. Their favourable impact on the balance of payments was, however, offset to a very large extent mainly by a decline in foreign government expenditures in Ceylon. Net outpayments on account of investment income at Rs. 38-7 million in 1960 were slightly higher than in 1959. A part of the increase was due to the increased dividend payments overseas resulting from the higher export earnings in 1959 and 1960 and the balance was due to increased interest payments on loans incurred by the Government of Ceylon.",

On the other hand movements in respect of private short-term capital, associated mainly with transactions under special account facilities,* showed a net payment of Rs. 5 \u2022 2 million, in contrast with a net receipt of Rs. 10 \u2022 0 million in 1959.",
