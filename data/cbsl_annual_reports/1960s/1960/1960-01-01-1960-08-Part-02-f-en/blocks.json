In previous Annual Reports this was measured by the net borrowing of the Government from the banking system plus the change in Government's cash balances. However, the system of counterpart funds connected with U.S. PL. 480 transactions necessitates a refinement in the computation of the direct inflationary impact of the budget. Payments by the Government for purchase of rice and flour made under U.S. PL. 480 Agreements are paid for by crediting the U.S. Aid counterpart fund account with the Central Bank. While such payments are accom\u00adpanied by a corresponding decline in Government's cash balances, they are not immediately reflected in an increase in the money supply as they do not constitute a payment to the private sector. Such payments in fact have a deflationary impact. However, payments made to the public from the U.S. Aid counter\u00adpart fund account either directly as U.S. Government expenses and private sector investments or indirectly through disbursements from loans and grants made to the Ceylon Government exert an inflationary impact on the money supply. Hence, to get a correct measure of the inflationary impact of the budget in any period it is necessary to adjust for changes in the balance outstanding in the U.S. Aid counterpart fund account.",

On the basis of provisional data there was a deficit of Rs. 210 million on current account transactions during the year as compared with a deficit of Rs. 208 million in 1959. 1960 is the fourth consecutive year in which the current account has been in deficit. The further small deterioration in the current account balance in 1960 was due to an increased deficit on merchandise account resulting from the continued rise in import payments. The merchandise deficit in 1960 was Rs. 94 million as compared with Rs. 81 million in 1959. In contrast there was a small improvement in the balance on invisible transactions with the deficit declining from Rs. 127 million to Rs. 115 million.",

    "text": "A recurrent deficit on invisibles account has been a normal feature of the Ceylon's balance of payments. A rational pattern for the merchandise balance, for a country with fluctuating export earnings and a recurrent deficit on invisible account would be for it to show a relatively large surplus in years when export earnings are high, and either a smaller surplus or a deficit in years when export earnings are low. The large merchandise deficits of 1959 and 1960 were however incurred at a time when export earnings have been relatively high, while import prices have been relatively low, in comparison with the immediately preceding years. Export earnings in 1960 were in fact higher than in any previous year except 1955 which was favoured by a sharp tea boom ; export earnings in 1959 were not much lower. Also the import price in 1959 and 1960 was 6 per cent lower than the average import price over the 10 years from 1950 to 1960. The continued increase in import payments, which was responsible for the merchandise account deficits even in 1959 and 1960, was directly the result of the sustained inflationary pressures generated in the economy, primarily through the budget deficits.",
