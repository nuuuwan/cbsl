The Financial Year 1962-63

Table II G-l shows in summary the accounts of the Government of Ceylon for the financial year October, 1962 to September, 1963 with corresponding data for previous years. As shown therein, the main features of the budgetary operations were as follows:—

(a) Total Government revenue in 1962/63 was Rs. 1593.4 million as compared with Rs. 1620.6 million in 1961/62 and Rs. 1513.9 million in 1960/61. (b) Total voted expenditure in 1962/63 was Rs. 1998.7 million as compared with Rs. 2061.3 million in 1961/62 and Rs. 1960.7 million in 1960/61. These figures exclude contributions to sinking funds, direct repayments of public debt from revenue and book adjustments. (c) Operations on advance accounts resulted in a net receipt of Rs. 13.7 million as compared with a net payment of Rs. 14.6 million in 1961/62 and Rs. 14.2 million in 1960/61. (d) The net cash deficit resulting from these operations was Rs. 391.7 million as compared with Rs. 456.1 million in 1961/62 and Rs. 462.5 million in 1960/61.

The actual net cash operating deficit of Rs. 391.7 million is lower than the originally estimated net cash deficit of Rs. 413.3 million by Rs. 21.6 million. In 1961/62 the actual net cash deficit exceeded the original estimate of the net cash deficit by Rs. 175.6 million. The reduction in the amount of the deficit in 1962/63 as compared with the estimated deficit occurred despite the heavy shortfall in revenue collections. The reduction in the budget deficit was mainly on account of a substantial reduction in total expenditure incurred in 1962/63. The shortfall in total expenditure compared with the original estimate was Rs. 131.5 million. The shortfall on capital expenditure amounted to Rs. 71.0 million and that on recurrent expenditure Rs. 60.5 million. Expressed as percentages of budget estimates the extent of shortfall under the two categories amounted to 15.0 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively. Net receipts on advance account operations of Rs. 13.7 milhon also contributed to reducing the actual net cash deficit as compared with the original estimate. As compared with 1961/62 the net cash deficit for 1962/63 shows a fall of Rs. 64.4 million. This was due to a shortfall in capital expenditure of Rs. 78.3 million and a receipt on advance account operations of Rs. 28.3 milhon, offset by a fall of Rs. 27.2 million in revenue and an increase of Rs. 15.7 million in recurrent expendi­ture. Revenue

Table 18 of Appendix II shows provisional estimates and actual revenue for 1962/63 by the main heads of revenue. Total Government revenue for 1962/63 of Rs. 1593.4 million is lower than the revenue collection of Rs. 1620.6 million of 1961/62 by Rs. 27.2 million, thus showing a break in the trend of increasing revenue collections recorded since 1952/53. The corresponding change in government revenue in the previous financial year 1961/62 over 1960/61 was an increase of Rs. 106.7 million.

The decrease in revenue over 1961/62 is accounted for mainly by the sizeable drop of Rs. 67.3 million under import duty collections alone. By far the largest single revenue item contributing to this decline was the category "other goods". Export duties likewise accounted for a decline of Rs. 12.2 million with the tea export duty, inclusive of the tea tax, falling short by Rs. 7.7 milhon.

As compared with the original estimate for 1962/63 the actual revenue collected shows a fall of the order of Rs. 123.5 million. This shortfall is accounted for by reduc­tions in collections as compared with the original estimate as follows—import duties

Rs. 108.5 million, export duties Rs. 2.9 million, national development tax Rs. 7.1 million and other revenue Rs. 6.0 million. Only few items showed an increase in revenue. Higher collections under the tobacco tax of Rs. 18.3 million, income tax (including the surcharge) of Rs. 6.8 million and tax on heavy oil motor vehicles of Rs. 2.5 million are notable.

Revenue from export duties was lower by Rs. 12.2 million as compared with the actual collections in 1961/62. This was as a result of collections under the tea export duty recording a shortfall of Rs. 7.7 million and duties on coconut a decrease of Rs. 4 million. Duty collections on rubber fell short by Rs. 0.9 milhon. The decline in export duty revenue in respect of tea(!) in 1962/63 as compared with 1961/62 may be explained as the result of (a) the decline in the proportion of the receipts siphoned by the ad valorem rate on account of the lower average prices that prevailed at the Colombo auctions, (b) the reduction of 2 cents per lb. on export duty in respect of all teas shipped through the ports of Galle and Trincomalee since April 1963 and (c) the higher duty collections arising from the increase in export volume of 2.5 million lbs. on application of the specific duty being offset by the combined effects of items (a) and (b) listed above. The decline in export duty revenue from rubber (2) despite the sizeable increase in the quantity exported in the financial year, an increase of 21.6 million lbs., is attributable to the lower prices that prevailed during this period. The lower average prices offset the receipts brought about by the increase in export volume. The decline in export receipts from coconuts was due chiefly to the reduction in the volume of exports. Exports of coconut oil which amounted to 102.3 thousand tons in 1961 /62 fell to 84.1 thousand tons in 1962/63, copra exports declined over the same period by 21.6 thousand tons while exports of desiccated coconuts fell by 2.5 thousand tons. The effects of these reductions in export volume on government revenue were, however, offset to a small extent by the higher effective rates of duties which were operative in 1962/63 following the favourable prices that prevailed. However, loss of duty on account of the contraction in the volume exported was too great to be offset by this favourable price effect.

Import duty revenue in 1962/63 as compared with the previous year, as men­tioned earlier, was lower by Rs. 67.3 million. The decline in collections under category "other goods", liquor and cotton textiles amounted to Rs. 60.9 million. This was offset to an extent of Rs. 4.2 million by the higher duty collected on tobacco and cigarettes consequent to the stepping up of the duty rate on tobacco and cigarettes in the budget of 1962. Whereas in 1961/62 the category "other goods" accounted for a net increase of Rs. 32.4 million, the collections in 1962/63 for the same group shows a net decline of Rs. 43.6 milhon. This is accounted for by the attempts taken in 1962 to bring about a sizeable reduction in the import bill through the direct curtailment of imports for stemming the drain in external reserves.

Income tax receipts in 1962/63 inclusive of the surcharge, show a decrease of Rs. 4 million as compared with the actual receipts of 1961/62. A possible explanation for the decrease would be the fall in the producers' profit margin—either through lower prices or higher costs of production—in the two main agricultural export

(1) Since June 1959 all teas sold in the Colombo Auctions at a price exceeding Rs. 1-85 per lb. are subject to a tax of 50 per cent of the excess of price over this amount. The maximum tax leviable is fixed at -/70 cts. In addition to the above ad valorem component a specific export duty of - / 3 5 cts. per lb. is also levied.

(2) Export duties on rubber are based on a sliding scale since 28.11.1963.

( 90 )

products tea and rubber leading to a consequential reduction in money incomes. An additional explanation for the decrease in tax collections in 1962/63 over 1961/62 would be tax evasion. It is however difficult to estimate the extent to which tax evasion could have played a part in reducing collections. It must, however, be borne in mind that other forces such as government fiscal operations of deficit financing and commercial bank net lending to the private sector would have offset at least to some extent the contractionary effects of low money incomes thereby moderating the extent of the fall in collections under this head. '

Two sources which have shown moderate increases in revenue are pro fits, derived from the sale of arrack of Rs. 26 million and receipts from the tobacco tax of Rs. 17.5 million. The increase in profits from the sale of arrack is accounted for partly to the addition of Rs. 18 million from accumulated profits of previous years to the revenue collections of 1962/63 and partly to higher receipts arising out of increased sales. In respect of tobacco, it was mainly the increase in consumption which helped to enhance collections. The consumption of tobacco showed an increase of 627,000 lbs. despite the duty increase brought into effect in July 1961 from Rs. 20 to Rs. 28 per lb.

(1) Current expenditure is derived by deducting the value of sinking fund contributions and direct repayments and expenditure of a capital nature (such as maintenance expenditure and purchase of durable goods) from the total of the Recurrent Expenditure votes (1, 2, 4 and 6).

(2) Capital expenditure includes expenditure on the creation, acquisition and maintenance of real assets whose useful life exceeds one year and expenditure on the acquisition of financial assets, mainly loans to the C.T.B., the Port (Cargo) Corporation and the Local Loans and Development Fund. Capital expenditure according to this definition is not synonymous with development expenditure as it includes certain capital items of a non-development character and excludes certain current items of development expenditure. Capital expenditure is made up of the expenditure under the capital expenditure votes (i.e. votes 3, 5 and 7) expenditure chargeable to foreign aid, both loans and grants, capital items in the recurrent expenditure votes and extra-budgetary outlays such as the rubber and tea replanting subsidy expenditure, Electrical Department Reserve Expenditure, etc. Extra-budgetary items amounted to Rs. 28-3 million in 1960/61, Rs. 21-8 million in 1961/62, Rs. 24-0 million (esti­mate) and Rs. 21 -9 million (provisional) in 1962/63 and Rs. 49 • 1 million in 1963/64.

( 91 )

Provisional figures of actual current expenditure in 1962/63 show a fall of Rs. 60.5 milhon compared with the budget estimate for that year. The actual expenditure (provisional) in 1962/63 is however higher than that of 1961/62 by Rs. 26.8 million as compared with an increase of the same magnitude in 1961/62 over 1960/61. Increase in current expenditure in 1959/60 and 1960/61 amounted to Rs. 91.0 million and Rs. 105.9 million respectively. As in the case of the previous financial year the smaller increase in current expenditure during 1962/63 was almost entirely due to the lower food subsidy bill charged to the Consolidated Fund. Increases in the expenditure on interest on public debt, education and pensions were partly offset by the fall in the food subsidy bill.

The net food subsidy bill for 1962/63 amounted to Rs. 225.8 million as com­pared with Rs. 235.4 million in 1961/62.(!) Corresponding figures for the previous financial years were Rs. 248.0 million in 1960/61, Rs. 193 0 million in 1959/60 and Rs. 146.5 million in 1958/59. Expressed as a percentage of total current expenditure, food subsidies accounted for 14.8 per cent in 1962/63, 15.7 per cent in 1961/62

•Provisional

(1) These figures are as given in Treasury Ledgers. Data provided by the Food Commissioner in respect of the net food subsidy bill differs from the Treasury figures as shown below for the following reasons. Total net food subsidy according to the Food Commissioner's data for 1961/62 is given as Rs. 230-7 milhon, a decrease of Rs. 4-7 million compared with the Treasury figure for 1961/62. This amount will be credited to Government revenue in a subse­quent year after the accounts of the Food Commissioner have been duly audited. Likewise the provisional estimate for the net food subsidy bill for 1962/63 as given by the Food Commissioner is placed at Rs. 238- 5 million which is Rs. 7- 8 milhon higher as compared with the actual figure for 1961/62. The difference between the Treasury figure of Rs. 225-8 million and the Food Commissioner's figure of Rs. 238- 5 million, viz., Rs. 12- 7 million was due to the supplementary estimate not being taken up. The difference between the Treasury ledger figure of Rs.,225-8 million for 1962/63 and the actual amount incurred in respect of 1962/63 will be adjusted by the financing of this difference under advance accounts.

•t The loss (subsidy) on rice (per unit) is calculated as follows :—

(a) The loss (subsidy) on sale of imported rice is the difference between the average landed cost to the Government and the average selling price to the authorised retail distributor. The landed cost comprises the c and / value plus other charges incurred up to the granaries. (6) The loss (subsidy) on sale of local rice is the difference between the cost to the Government of local rice and the average selling price to the authorised retail distributor. Whereas the loss on imported rice is the consumer subsidy, the loss on local rice includes both consumer and producer subsidies.

( 92 )

and 16.9 per cent in 1960/61. The net food subsidy bill of Rs. 238.5 million inclusive of the Rs. 12.7 million financed from advance accounts, expressed as a percentage of voted current expenditure, adjusted for the increased subsidy is 15.5.

A breakdown of the net food subsidy bill according to the provisional data provided by the Food Commissioner for the financial year 1962/63 and the actual for 1961/62 is given in Table II G-4. Changes between the years are also indicated^1)

A possible explanation for the increase in the loss on the sale of imported rice in 1962/63 is the increase in landed cost of imported rice. In the case of rice the average landed cost of rice from Burma which was Rs. 535 per long ton in 1961/62 was Rs. 546 per long ton in 1962/63, thus showing an increase of Rs. 11 per long ton. The average landed cost of rice from China showed a still higher increase from Rs. 515 in 1961/62 to Rs. 541 in 1962/63, an increase of Rs. 26 per long ton. The increased loss on local rice is accounted by the larger purchases and sales of local rice.

The decrease in the profit on the sale of sugar was due to the higher buying price of sugar whilst the retail sale price of sugar remained unchanged. The average landed cost of white sugar amounted to Rs. 1193 per long ton in 1962/63 as compared with Rs. 500 per long ton in 1961/62, a more than doubling in the average landed cost of the commodity. The reduction in profits from the sale of sugar would have been higher had it not been for the availability of stocks of sugar at the beginning of the financial year which had been purchased at lower rates in the previous financial year. The running down of these stocks no doubt minimised the extent of the reduction in profit on the sale of sugar, and the size of the net food subsidy bill.

The purchase price of flour from Australia which remained unchanged in the financial years 1960/61 and 1961/62 at Rs. 461 per long ton increased by Rs. 20/-per long ton to Rs. 481 in 1962/63.

The purchases of paddy under the guaranteed price scheme during 1962/63 amounted to 25,515,945 bushels as compared with 25,065,890 bushels, an increase of450,055 bushels.

Capital Expenditure

Total capital expenditure (i.e. the total of votes 3, 5 and 7 of budgetary expen­diture) for 1962/63 amounted to Rs. 402.3 million. If to this is added extra-budgetary outlays of the tea and rubber replanting subsidy expenditure, capital items in the revenue budget etc., total capital expenditure in 1962/63 was Rs. 495.9 million (provisional). This is Rs. 74-4 million lower than the original estimate for the year and Rs. 89.7 million less than the actual expenditure of 1961 /62. Capital expenditure in respect of acquisition, construction, and maintenance of real assets decreased by Rs. 13.5 million and loans to Government agencies fell by Rs. 76.2 million in 1962/63 as compared with 1961/62. The fall in respect of acquisition, construction and maintenance of real assets has occurred mainly under the category of agriculture, irrigation and fisheries. The fall in the amount of loans to Government agencies is mainly due to the provision of smaller loans to the Ceylon Transport Board and the Port (Cargo) Corporation.

(1) A direct comparison between the two sets of figures is justifiable only if the provisional figure does not diverge substantially from the actual figure.

( 98. )

Advance Account Operations

Advance account operations during 1962/63 resulted in a net receipt of Rs. 13.7 million as compared with a net payment of Rs. 14.6 milhon in 1961/62. This receipt occurred inspite of a payment of Rs. 12.7 million to finance a portion of the food subsidy bill which could not be charged to the Consolidated Fund. The net receipt of Rs. 13.7 milhon is mainly due to a fall of Rs. 20.3 million in the accumulated trade balance with China under the Trade and Payments Agreement between Ceylon and China. Ceylon's credit balance in the China account was utilized to finance a part of Ceylon's rice imports from China during the year.

In the budget for 1962/63 the sources of financing indicated by the Finance Minister for the budget deficit of Rs. 463.3 million were Rs. 180 million from domestic market borrowing and Rs. 150 milhon from foreign aid leaving an unbridged gap of Rs. 133.3 million. The estimated net cash deficit for 1962/63 was Rs. 413.3 milhon. The actual net cash deficit on account of reasons mentioned earlier in this section was Rs. 391.7 million. This reduction in the cash deficit together with the increased borrowing from domestic non-bank sources helped to reduce the magnitude of domestic market borrowing from the banking system. The reduced reliance on expansionary finance is also discernible from the negligible reduction of Rs. 0.4 million of cash balances as well as the repayment of Rs. 33.8 million under administrative borrowing.

( 8* )

The net expansionary impact of the budget as adjusted for the change in U.S. Aid Counterpart Funds was smaller than that of the previous year, amounting to Rs.. 162.0 million as compared with 190.4 million in 1961/62, Rs. 233.9 million in 1960/61 and Rs. 251.1 million in 1959/60.

Borrowing from the banking system amounting to Rs. 178.1 million compares favourably with that of the previous financial year. Of the total sum borrowed in 1962/63 Rs. 156.2 million came from the Central Bank, and Rs. 22.0 million from the commercial banks.

Central Bank advances increased by Rs. 36.6 million while Treasury Bill purchases by the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 124.5 million. Commercial banks purchased treasury bills amounting to Rs. 27.5 million compared with Rs. 42 million in 1961/62. Commercial bank holdings of both rupee securities as well as tax reserve certificates declined by Rs. 5.4 million and Rs. 0.1 million respectively.

Foreign aid for capital expenditure received in 1962/63 amounted to Rs. 99.8 million as compared with Rs. 62.6 million in 1961/62, Rs. 29.6 million in 1960/61 and Rs. 38.6 million in 1959/60. Foreign loan repayments during the four years amounted to Rs. 6.3 million, Rs. 6.8 million, Rs. 3.0 million and Rs. 2.7 million respectively. Although net receipts of foreign aid and grants have shown an increase and hence is indicative of a higher utilization of such foreign assistance, there nevertheless remains a difference between original expectations and actual outturn. A shortfall in utilization of foreign aid makes little difference to the financing of the deficit where the receipt of aid is tied to an equivalent amount of capital expenditure. However, from the perspective of capital formation and economic growth under-utilization of aid is a matter for concern. The details of foreign aid received in 1962/63 are as follows :—

The figure of net market borrowing from noii-bank sources for the year 1962/63 of Rs. 153.5 million is an improvement over that of 1961/62. It is however, lower than that of 1960/61 when an amount of Rs. 165.2 million was achieved. Savings institutions, Employees' Provident Fund, insurance funds ;and other companies were instrumental in improving their share of contributions in the enlarged total. An analysis of domestic market borrowing together with changes between the years is given under the section detailing development in public debt 1962/63.

The increases in gross debt and the net debt during the financial year 1962/63 were Rs. 399.5 million and Rs. 379.3 milhon respectively. The corresponding figures for the previous financial year were Rs. 386.8 million and Rs. 353.4 milhon. The increase in gross debt by Rs. 399.5 milhon consisted of Rs. 168.3 million in rupee securities, Rs. 125 million of Treasury bills, Rs. 6.3 milhon of Tax reserve certi­ficates and Rs. 63.0 milhon in foreign debt. Central Bank advances increased by Rs. 36.9 milhon compared with the net repayment of Rs. 20.9 milhon in 1961/62.

Of rupee loans amounting to Rs. 221.3 million issued during the financial year 1962/63 two loans amounting to Rs. 16.3 million were conversion loans while the balance ten loans aggregating Rs. 205.0 million were cash issues. The 3£% Conversion Loan 1968/70 and 4^ % Conversion Loan 1984/88 amounting to Rs. 16.3 million were issued in conversion of part of the 2 | % Loan 1961/63 of Rs. 16.3 million which matured in February 1963. Stock of the maturing loan amounting to Rs. 10.8 million was surrendered in payment for stock of the 3J% Conversion Loan 1968/70. The balance Rs. 5.5 million was subscribed for in cash, with Rs. 5.2

( 97 )

million being absorbed in the 3|% Conversion Loan 1968/70 and Rs. 0.3 million in the 4£% Conversion Loan 1984/88. Of the other ten issues floated eight were entirely for cash; these being the 3J% Loan 1967/69 and the 4£% Loan 1983/87 'F Series both issued in October/November 1962, the 4£% Loan 1983/87 'H' Series issued in December 1962, the 4J% Loan 1984/88 'B' Series issued in February 1963, the 4J% Loan 1984/88 'C Series issued in March 1963, the 4£% Loan 1984/88 issued in June 1963, the 4|% Loan 1984/88 'B' Series issued in July 1963 and the 4£% Loan 1984/88 V Series issued in September 1963.

Stocks of the maturing.3$.% Loan 1957-1962 amounting to Rs. 5.0 million and Rs. 9.4 million were surrendered in payment for stocks of the 4J% Loan 1983/87 'G' Series and the 3t% Loan 1967-69 'B' Series respectively issued in November, 1962. All the issues totalling Rs. 221.3 million were fully subscribed. A classification of the allotments is shown in Table II G-9.

Investors:—Table II G-9 on page 96 which gives a classification of allotments of government securities shows that the Employees' Provident Fund absorbed Rs. 67.8 million or 30.6 per cent of the total loans floated as compared with Rs. 54.0 million (27.9%) in 1961/62. The balance Rs. 153 million of loans issued in 1962/63 was absorbed as follows: Subscribers grouped under the classification "Trusts, provident and pension funds" other than Employees' Provident Fund absorbed 16.5 per cent, sinking funds 16.4 per cent while insurance companies including the State owned Insurance Corporation accounted for 11.9 per cent. Commercial banks and savings institutions contributed 11.5 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. The Annual Report for 1962 had comented on the decline in demand for Government securities from the source of non-bank investors during 1961-62, the experience in 1962-63 represented an improvement over 1961/62. The absorption of Government securities by non-bank investors occurred relative to the previous year despite the fact that privately owned time and savings deposits of commercial banks increased by Rs. 64.8 million as compared with the increase of Rs. 42.6 million in 1961/62.

Maturity and Rate Classification:—By maturity classifications, nine 21-25 year loans amounting to Rs. 181 million were issued. The first six of these loans were issued at 4J% per annum, thereafter the rate of interest was raised by J%, and the first of the three issues at the higher rate of interest was issued in June 1963. They may be compared with the interest rate of 4J% on loans of the same maturity issued in the previous fiscal year. Three loans amounting to Rs. 40 million were 5-7 year loans issued at 3$%. The rate of interest on these loans had already been raised from 3£% to 3i% per annum in March 1962.

Treasury Bills:—Contrary to the trend in recent years the increase in the volume of Treasury Bills did not constitute the largest component in the increase of the gross domestic public debt during 1962/63. Its position as the largest component in the in­crease in the gross debt was displaced by rupee securities. The volume of Treasury Bills issued and outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year on 1.10.1962 stood at Rs. 1,000 million; the authorised limit being also at Rs. 1,000 million. By a resolution of Parliament dated 21.3.1963 the authorised limit was increased by Rs. 150 million to Rs. 1150 million. By the end of the fiscal year, on 30.9.63, the amount of Treasury Bills issued and outstanding stood at Rs. 1,125 million showing an increase of Rs. 125 million during the fiscal year. Thus at the end of the fiscal year there was an un­utilized balance of Rs. 25.0 million to the possible limit of Treasury bill issues.

The holdings of Treasury Bills of the Central Bank as at the end of September 1963 was Rs. 988.9 million as compared with Rs. 864.4 million as at 30.9.62 and Rs. 680.0 million at the end of September 1961.

New Tax Measures

1. Income Tax:—Substantial changes in the Inland Revenue Act were made in 1963/64 budget with a view to lowering the tax burden on the recipients of low incomes, providing preferential treatment for earned income and extending the privilege to self employed persons as well and reducing tax relief for dependants at higher levels of income. The more significant changes introduced in the computation of income for tax purpose were as follows:—

(a) The abohtion of the quotient system of taxation and introducing in its place a method of tax computation wherein the first slab of taxable income varies with family size. This particular slab ranges from Rs. 4,000 —Rs. 13,000 and will be taxed at the rate of 15 per cent. Subsequent slabs of taxable income will be of the same size for all tax payers irrespective of family circumstances. The proposed first slab for a single person will be Rs. 4,000 and for a husband and wife Rs. 7,000. There is an additional Rs. 1,500 for each child or dependent up to a maximum of four children or dependents so that for a married couple and four children the first slab is Rs. 13,000. The effect of these changes is that about 25,000 to 28,000 tax payers with annual incomes between Rs. 3,000-6,000 will be completely exempted from income tax. While tax relief is envisaged for persons whose annual incomes are between Rs. 6,000 and below Rs. 15,000, persons with incomes between Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 will continue to bear approximately the same tax burden as before. Above the income range of Rs. 20,000 there will be an increase in tax burdens on account of the reduction of relief for dependants.

(b) Granting of a tax free allowance of Rs. 500 a year on earned income.

(c) A change in the definition of the term "dependents" to include brothers maintained at an educational establishment as well as unmarried sisters.

(d) Non-aggregation of income of an employed unmarried child with that of the parent. The employment income of a wife will be subject to aggregation but the allowance in respect of employment income will be a permissible deduction against such income.

(e) Abohtion of the levy of a minimum tax rate of 3 per cent or 4 per cent irrespective of family circumstances and responsibilities.

( 103 )

(J) Other changes peri»ining to the taxation of income include the withdrawal of income tax relief on investments in government securities, extension of tax relief to new large scale undertakings in agriculture, dairy farming and livestock farming, provision of tax relief for training of apprentices in industrial and engineering firms and a limitation of deductible business salaries to Rs. 36,000 per employee per year.

Other important revenue measures

Turnover Tax:—Two new taxes have been introduced into the tax structure. (J) A manufacturers turnover tax and a business turnover tax. The manufacturers turnover tax is to be levied at 3 per cent on a wide range of consumer goods manu­factured locally. The business turnover tax is levied at one half of one per cent of total turnover. The tax covers all business including those which .supply services. The following are exempted from liability to tax. Firstly turnover of rice, flour, sugar, bread, export products, arrack and toddy in taverns, petrol, cigarettes, kerosene, diesel and other fuels, and lubricating oils. Books, periodicals and magazines are also exempted. Secondly, financial institutions of all descriptions such as banks, insurance companies, hire-purchase companies, pawn brokers, money lenders, commission agents etc. Thirdly, educational costs and services of professional business. Finally all business whose annual turnover is less than Rs. 100,000. The turnover tax will be allowed as a deduction in the computation of business profits.

Exchange Tax(2)

The new tax was imposed on foreign exchange purchased for items such as holiday travel, passenger fores, commission and advertisements. The rate of the new tax will on average broadly parallel the average rate of jimport-duty paid on imported merchandise. The rates of the new tax will vary between 10 and 25 per cent depending on the type of payment. (2) Payments on account of property, dividends, education and medical expenses will be exempted from this tax.

Higher Import Duties

Import duties on certain luxury and semi-luxury items have been raised sub­stantially. These articles include washing machines, refrigerators, floor polishers, tape recorders, carpets, luxury bathroom fittings, electric lighting accessories. In addition to the above changes, adjustments of import duties have been made to maintain previous preferential and non-preferential margins which had been widened as a result of the 20 per cent surcharge imposed in 1962/63. The duty on super petrol was raised by 10 cents per gallon.

National Lottery

A fortnightly national lottery with 500 prizes at each draw has replaced the Hospital lottery. The prize winnings in the national lottery are tax free.

(1) These taxes eame into operation on 1st January 1964. The tax rates proposed in the budget were manufacturers turnover tax 1-10 per cent and business turnover tax one half of one percent. During the Committee Stage the tax rate on manufacturers turnover tax was reduced to 3 per cent. (2) The Foreign Exchange Tax came into effect on 11th January, 1964. The rates applicable to transactions are 10% and 20% depending on the type of payment.

( 104 )

Measures to reduce cost of living

Of the measures proposed in the Budget towards this end, the following are worthy of note :—

(a) reduction in the retail price of flour by 5 cents reducing the cost of flour to 23 cents and the price of a pound of bread to 25 cents.

(6) reduction in the price of kerosene by 4 cents' to make available to consumers a gallon of kerosene at 94 cents.

(c) lower duties on textiles such as cotton piece goods, cotton sarees, art silk piece goods and crepe and satin.

Current Expenditure

The total of recurrent expenditure (votes 1, 2, 4 and 6) amount to Rs. 1,790.4 milhon. When items of a capital nature under recurrent expenditure and provisions for sinking fund contributions and direct repayment of debt are deducted from this figure, the resultant current expenditure amounts to Rs. 1660.7 milhon. This compares with the actual outlay of Rs. 1,524.9 milhon for 1962/63. The increase in the current expenditure for 1963/64 is mainly due to higher provisions in respect of the food subsidy bill, interest on public debt and pensions.

Capital Expenditure

The original estimates of capital expenditure (votes 3, 5 and 7) amount to Rs. 516.4 milhon. When capital items under the votes of recurrent expenditure and extra-budgetary capital expenditure from reserves are added, total capital expendi­ture for the fiscal year 1963/64 amounts to Rs. 639.4 milhon. This figure is Rs. 143.5 milhon higher than the actual expenditure for 1962/63 and Rs. 69.1 milhon higher than the original estimate for 1962/63. The increase of Rs. 143.5 million is mainly due to increased expenditure under the categories of manufacture, mining and trade as well as loans to government agencies.

Financing of the Budget Deficit

As finally voted by the House of Representatives, government accounts reveal a budget deficit of Rs. 474.5 milhon. This deficit is expected to be financed to the extent of Rs. 220 milhon through the medium of domestic borrowing from institutional and other investors, receipts from foreign aid of Rs. 175 milhon and administrative borrowing of Rs. 25 milhon, aggregating Rs. 420 million. The balance Rs. 54.5 million was to be financed through the sale of government securities to commercial banks and partly through the issue of Treasury Bills.

In the section to follow receipts from foreign aid is singled out for a detailed explanation.

Foreign Assistance

In the budget for 1963/64, total anticipated utihzation from foreign aid is placed at Rs. 175 million, Rs. 25 million more than in the previous financial year. As compared with the actual receipt of foreign and in 1962/63 the figure is higher by Rs. 75.2 million. Allocations for specified projects were made in respect of Rs. 130.3 million. Of this amount Rs. 106.8 milhon would be in the form of loans and ntihsatipn from lines of credit and Rg, 24 million in the form of grants,

( 105 )

Aid amounting to Rs. 38.6 million is expected to be received from the U.S.S.R. in the current financial year from a line of credit of Rs. 142.8 milhon previously negotiated. Two loans, one of Rs. 15 milhon for the Iron and Steel Corporation and another of Rs. 20 milhon for the Tyre and Tube Corporation will absorb the greater part of this loan. The balance will be used for the proposed cold storage plant in Kandy for fruits and vegetables and the setting up of a flour mill. Rs. 30.1 milhon of loans from the I.B.R.D. (of loans negotiated earlier) will be utilised during the fiscal year 1963/64 for work on two hydro-electric projects stages 2A and 2B as well as for the Second Thermal Set at Grandpass. Other major foreign aid receipts are as follows—(a) Rs. 16.4 milhon from West Germany of which Rs. 14.1 milhon is for the Ceylon Cement Corporation and (b) Rs. 21.3 milhon from Canada of which Rs. 9.6 milhon is to be spent on the Maskehya Oya Project.

Note.—Since the formulation of the Budget estimates, world prices of rice, sugar and flour have increased. In addition freight rates have also increased. Hence with the increase in the landed cost of these items and additional expenditure on demurrage, the cost of the net food subsidy bill has been revised from Rs. 272.9 milhon to Rs. 439-9 milhon, an increase of Rs. 167.0 million.
