In 1961/62 the actual net cash deficit exceeded the original estimate of the net cash deficit by Rs. 175.6 million. The reduction in the amount of the deficit in 1962/63 as compared with the estimated deficit occurred despite the heavy shortfall in revenue collections. The reduction in the budget deficit was mainly on account of a substantial reduction in total expenditure incurred in 1962/63. The shortfall in total expenditure compared with the original estimate was Rs. 131.5 million. The shortfall on capital expenditure amounted to Rs. 71.0 million and that on recurrent expenditure Rs. 60.5 million. Expressed as percentages of budget estimates the extent of shortfall under the two categories amounted to 15.0 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively. Net receipts on advance account operations of Rs. 13.7 milhon also contributed to reducing the actual net cash deficit as compared with the original estimate. As compared with 1961/62 the net cash deficit for 1962/63 shows a fall of Rs. 64.4 million. This was due to a shortfall in capital expenditure of Rs. 78.3 million and a receipt on advance account operations of Rs. 28.3 milhon, offset by a fall of Rs. 27.2 million in revenue and an increase of Rs. 15.7 million in recurrent expendi\u00adture.

    "text": "Revenue from export duties was lower by Rs. 12.2 million as compared with the actual collections in 1961/62. This was as a result of collections under the tea export duty recording a shortfall of Rs. 7.7 million and duties on coconut a decrease of Rs. 4 million. Duty collections on rubber fell short by Rs. 0.9 milhon. The decline in export duty revenue in respect of tea(!) in 1962/63 as compared with 1961/62 may be explained as the result of (a) the decline in the proportion of the receipts siphoned by the ad valorem rate on account of the lower average prices that prevailed at the Colombo auctions, (b) the reduction of 2 cents per lb. on export duty in respect of all teas shipped through the ports of Galle and Trincomalee since April 1963 and (c) the higher duty collections arising from the increase in export volume of 2.5 million lbs. on application of the specific duty being offset by the combined effects of items (a) and (b) listed above. The decline in export duty revenue from rubber (2) despite the sizeable increase in the quantity exported in the financial year, an increase of 21.6 million lbs., is attributable to the lower prices that prevailed during this period. The lower average prices offset the receipts brought about by the increase in export volume. The decline in export receipts from coconuts was due chiefly to the reduction in the volume of exports. Exports of coconut oil which amounted to 102.3 thousand tons in 1961 /62 fell to 84.1 thousand tons in 1962/63, copra exports declined over the same period by 21.6 thousand tons while exports of desiccated coconuts fell by 2.5 thousand tons. The effects of these reductions in export volume on government revenue were, however, offset to a small extent by the higher effective rates of duties which were operative in 1962/63 following the favourable prices that prevailed. However, loss of duty on account of the contraction in the volume exported was too great to be offset by this favourable price effect.",

This was offset to an extent of Rs. 4.2 million by the higher duty collected on tobacco and cigarettes consequent to the stepping up of the duty rate on tobacco and cigarettes in the budget of 1962. Whereas in 1961/62 the category \"other goods\" accounted for a net increase of Rs. 32.4 million, the collections in 1962/63 for the same group shows a net decline of Rs. 43.6 milhon.

It is however difficult to estimate the extent to which tax evasion could have played a part in reducing collections. It must, however, be borne in mind that other forces such as government fiscal operations of deficit financing and commercial bank net lending to the private sector would have offset at least to some extent the contractionary effects of low money incomes thereby moderating the extent of the fall in collections under this head.

The increase in profits from the sale of arrack is accounted for partly to the addition of Rs. 18 million from accumulated profits of previous years to the revenue collections of 1962/63 and partly to higher receipts arising out of increased sales. In respect of tobacco, it was mainly the increase in consumption which helped to enhance collections. The consumption of tobacco showed an increase of 627,000 lbs. despite the duty increase brought into effect in July 1961 from Rs. 20 to Rs. 28 per lb.",

Increase in current expenditure in 1959/60 and 1960/61 amounted to Rs. 91.0 million and Rs. 105.9 million respectively. As in the case of the previous financial year the smaller increase in current expenditure during 1962/63 was almost entirely due to the lower food subsidy bill charged to the Consolidated Fund. Increases in the expenditure on interest on public debt, education and pensions were partly offset by the fall in the food subsidy bill.",

This amount will be credited to Government revenue in a subse\u00adquent year after the accounts of the Food Commissioner have been duly audited. Likewise the provisional estimate for the net food subsidy bill for 1962/63 as given by the Food Commissioner is placed at Rs. 238- 5 million which is Rs. 7- 8 milhon higher as compared with the actual figure for 1961/62. The difference between the Treasury figure of Rs. 225-8 million and the Food Commissioner's figure of Rs. 238- 5 million, viz., Rs. 12- 7 million was due to the supplementary estimate not being taken up. The difference between the Treasury ledger figure of Rs.,225-8 million for 1962/63 and the actual amount incurred in respect of 1962/63 will be adjusted by the financing of this difference under advance accounts.",

The average landed cost of rice from China showed a still higher increase from Rs. 515 in 1961/62 to Rs. 541 in 1962/63, an increase of Rs. 26 per long ton. The increased loss on local rice is accounted by the larger purchases and sales of local rice.",

    "text": "The decrease in the profit on the sale of sugar was due to the higher buying price of sugar whilst the retail sale price of sugar remained unchanged. The average landed cost of white sugar amounted to Rs. 1193 per long ton in 1962/63 as compared with Rs. 500 per long ton in 1961/62, a more than doubling in the average landed cost of the commodity. The reduction in profits from the sale of sugar would have been higher had it not been for the availability of stocks of sugar at the beginning of the financial year which had been purchased at lower rates in the previous financial year. The running down of these stocks no doubt minimised the extent of the reduction in profit on the sale of sugar, and the size of the net food subsidy bill.",

The fall in respect of acquisition, construction and maintenance of real assets has occurred mainly under the category of agriculture, irrigation and fisheries. The fall in the amount of loans to Government agencies is mainly due to the provision of smaller loans to the Ceylon Transport Board and the Port (Cargo) Corporation.",

The estimated net cash deficit for 1962/63 was Rs. 413.3 milhon. The actual net cash deficit on account of reasons mentioned earlier in this section was Rs. 391.7 million. This reduction in the cash deficit together with the increased borrowing from domestic non-bank sources helped to reduce the magnitude of domestic market borrowing from the banking system. The reduced reliance on expansionary finance is also discernible from the negligible reduction of Rs. 0.4 million of cash balances as well as the repayment of Rs. 33.8 million under administrative borrowing.",

Foreign loan repayments during the four years amounted to Rs. 6.3 million, Rs. 6.8 million, Rs. 3.0 million and Rs. 2.7 million respectively. Although net receipts of foreign aid and grants have shown an increase and hence is indicative of a higher utilization of such foreign assistance, there nevertheless remains a difference between original expectations and actual outturn. A shortfall in utilization of foreign aid makes little difference to the financing of the deficit where the receipt of aid is tied to an equivalent amount of capital expenditure. However, from the perspective of capital formation and economic growth under-utilization of aid is a matter for concern. The details of foreign aid received in 1962/63 are as follows :\u2014",

The balance Rs. 153 million of loans issued in 1962/63 was absorbed as follows: Subscribers grouped under the classification \"Trusts, provident and pension funds\" other than Employees' Provident Fund absorbed 16.5 per cent, sinking funds 16.4 per cent while insurance companies including the State owned Insurance Corporation accounted for 11.9 per cent. Commercial banks and savings institutions contributed 11.5 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. The Annual Report for 1962 had comented on the decline in demand for Government securities from the source of non-bank investors during 1961-62, the experience in 1962-63 represented an improvement over 1961/62. The absorption of Government securities by non-bank investors occurred relative to the previous year despite the fact that privately owned time and savings deposits of commercial banks increased by Rs. 64.8 million as compared with the increase of Rs. 42.6 million in 1961/62.

The volume of Treasury Bills issued and outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year on 1.10.1962 stood at Rs. 1,000 million; the authorised limit being also at Rs. 1,000 million. By a resolution of Parliament dated 21.3.1963 the authorised limit was increased by Rs. 150 million to Rs. 1150 million. By the end of the fiscal year, on 30.9.63, the amount of Treasury Bills issued and outstanding stood at Rs. 1,125 million showing an increase of Rs. 125 million during the fiscal year. Thus at the end of the fiscal year there was an un\u00adutilized balance of Rs. 25.0 million to the possible limit of Treasury bill issues.",

This particular slab ranges from Rs. 4,000 \u2014Rs. 13,000 and will be taxed at the rate of 15 per cent. Subsequent slabs of taxable income will be of the same size for all tax payers irrespective of family circumstances. The proposed first slab for a single person will be Rs. 4,000 and for a husband and wife Rs. 7,000. There is an additional Rs. 1,500 for each child or dependent up to a maximum of four children or dependents so that for a married couple and four children the first slab is Rs. 13,000. The effect of these changes is that about 25,000 to 28,000 tax payers with annual incomes between Rs. 3,000-6,000 will be completely exempted from income tax. While tax relief is envisaged for persons whose annual incomes are between Rs. 6,000 and below Rs. 15,000, persons with incomes between Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 will continue to bear approximately the same tax burden as before. Above the income range of Rs. 20,000 there will be an increase in tax burdens on account of the reduction of relief for dependants.",
