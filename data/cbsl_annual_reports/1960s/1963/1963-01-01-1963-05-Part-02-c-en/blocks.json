The latter was due to lower retail prices of meat, fish, eggs and hmes which more than offset the higher vegetable prices. The increase in the price of vegetables towards the end of 1963 was influenced by the unseasonal rains in the months of September, October, November and December, which had adverse effects on vegetable cultivation. The rise in prices in the import food-group was due to increases in the prices of condensed milk, dried fish, maldive fish and onions, and to changes in the prices of wheat flour and sugar. The price of white sugar was increased in February 1963, from 62 cents to 67 cents a pound, and of wheat flour from 23 cents to 28 cents in July 1961. In August 1963, the price of wheat flour was reduced to its former level. Brown sugar which was not available since January 1962 was marketed after November 1963, at 63 cents per pound. The export food group rose by 3.4 per cent largely due to the greater export demand for coconut products which was reflected in a rise in domestic prices. Fats and oils too recorded higher prices in the export food group in 1963.",

It is restricted to items entering into the pattern of working class consumption in Colombo. Items whose prices are subsidised or controlled, or which are not subject to strict import restrictions, account for relatively heavy weight in the index. Data relating to price changes of items not in the index reveal that prices of durable consumer goods like sewing machines, refrigerators, china ware etc., and of items such as electrical equip\u00adment, tyres and tubes and spare parts of motor vehicles a wide range of machinery, base metals, and construction materials have shown considerable increases. The increase in the prices of durable consumer goods was due to import restrictions, the increases in import duties introduced in 1961, 1962 and 1963 and to increases in unit profit margins due to scarcities.",
