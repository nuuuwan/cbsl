    "text": "In 1963 the current account deficit in Ceylon's balance of payments increased shghtly from Rs. 143.8 milhon in 1962 to Rs. 146.4 milhon. The increase was due to a deterioration in the invisible account, which more than offset a small improvement in the deficit on merchandise account. The deficit on merchandise account fell from Rs. 142.9 million- in 1962 to Rs. 129.6 million in 1963, despite the adverse movements in the terms of trade. In contrast the deficit of Rs. 0.9 million on invisibles account in 1962 was increased to Rs. 16.8 million in 1963 largely because of reduced earnings from the port of Colombo.1",

    "text": "The current account deficit of Rs. 146.4 milhon in 1963 was financed by increa\u00adsing external habihties and by drawing down external assets. A significant development in 1963 was the increase in net receipts of long-term capital from Rs. 38 milhon in 1962 to Rs. 79 million in 1963. It is now generally accepted that all developing countries have to depend on foreign assistance in the form of long-term borrowings in order to supplement their resources for development expenditure. In recognition of this fact-it is often considered that such long-term capital receipts should be netted against the current account deficit as an appropriate criterion of the basic balance of payments position of a country.2 On this criterion the \"basic deficit\" dechned from Rs. 106 milhon in 1962 to Rs. 67 milhon in 1963. The sources of finance of this basic deficit were an increase in short-term habihties of Rs. 31 milhon, con\u00adsisting of credits received under bilateral trade and payments agreements and a decline of Rs. 42 milhon in external assets, particularly in the international reserve of the Central Bank.",

The price index of essential food imports, which account for approximately 40jper cent of Ceylon's total import outlay, was in fact the highest since 1957.

    "text": "The reduced surplus on the item\"port expenditure and non-freight transportation and insurance'' was the result of a decline of Rs. 10 million in earnings on bunkering and other facilities provided to foreign ships. It is estimated that there was a decline of approximately 15 per cent in the number of ships that called at Ceylon ports in 1963. The increased deficit on investment income was the result of reduced earnings on the declining external asset and the increase in interest payments on foreign loans. Dividend payments at Rs. 51 million remained more or less at the same level as in 1962. Interest payments on foreign loans have increased from Rs. 8 million in 1956 to Rs. 16 million in 1963. The balance under 'government expenditures' improved slightly in 1963 despite a reduction of about Rs. 3 million in the expenditures of foreign embassies in Ceylon. This was the result of a fall of Rs. 8 million in Ceylon Government's expenditures abroad on non-merchandise account, primarily as a result of a curtailment of Ceylon embassy expenses abroad and the completion in 1962 of the payment of compensation to the U.K. Government for the naval and air bases taken over by the Government of Ceylon.",

The gross outflow of private long-term capital was Rs. 4.3 million, which compares with the average of Rs. 40 million in the years prior to 1957, in which year restrictions were introduced on the repatriation of foreign capital invested in Ceylon. These restrictions have been progressively tightened with the result that gross capital transfers from Ceylon have continued to dechne even after 1957\u2014in 1961 and 1962 they amounted to Rs. 12 million and Rs. 10 milhon respectively.",

This pattern of financing reflects the increased inflow of development capital and the increase in imports financed through bilateral payments agreements and, funda\u00admentally, the diminishing level of Ceylon's foreign exchange reserves. In 1963 a fifth of financing deficit was financed by a reduction in external assets, while 64 per cent was financed by an increase in external liabilities mainly long-term liabilities. Short-term liabilities which increased by Rs. 42.2 million consist mainly of increases in amounts due from Ceylon under payments account. Estimated official donations in 1963 of Rs. 35.4 million helped finance the balance of the financing deficit. The main components of the estimated receipt' of official donations are CARE milk and flour from the U.S.A. (Rs. 23 million) and grants under Colombo Plan from Australia and Canada.",

The deficit of Rs. 142.3 milhon with the last mentioned group reflected a'dverse balances of Rs. 73 .'5'million and Rs. 73.0 million in respect of Ceylon's trade with the centrally planned economies (including China), and Japan respectively. The surplus of Rs^ 17 milhon in 1962 with centrally planned economies was converted into a deficit of Rs. 73.5 milhon in 1963, whereas the deficit with Japan has been approximately halved. The increased deficit with the centrally planned economies resulted from a 30 per cent increase in the value of imports combined with a dechne of 12 per cent in the value of exports. In contrast in the case of Japan, exports showed a small improvement of Rs. 2.6 million but imports dechned by Rs. 61.7 milhon (36 per cent) reflecting the effects of the intensification of import restrictions.",

    "text": "Ceylon's external assets at the end of 1963 (excluding those assets set apart for sterling loans sinking funds) of Rs. 358.8 million, represent only 19 per cent of the value of imports in 1963. An open economy such as Ceylon finds its balance of payments extremely vulnerable to forces arising from the terms on which exports can be exchanged for imports and from fluctuations in the volume of exports and imports. Ceylon's experience over the last few years and particularly in 1963 indi\u00adcates this extreme susceptibility of her balance of payments to changes arising from the instability of prices of exports and imports. In addition, in recent years it has been found that Ceylon's short-term liabilities have increased by substantial amounts, particularly the bilateral balances on payments agreements. The growth in these short-term liabilities and the marked variability in their, levels over short periods, further underlines the need to maintain a reasonable minimum level of external reserves.",
