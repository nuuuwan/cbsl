Thereafter it fell steadily to Rs. 178.2 million in September, moved up to Rs. 194.5 million in October, and dropped sharply again to Rs. 114.2 million by December. Thus over the year the international reserve declined by Rs. 37.9 million or 24.9 per cent (reflecting entirely a fall in cash and balances abroad), compared with a similar contraction of Rs. 32.6 million or 17.7 per cent in 1962. At the end of 1963, the international reserve of the Central Bank constituted 24.7 per cent of the country's total external assets compared with 30.2 per cent in 1962. As a proportion of Central Bank's total currency and demand liabilities, the international reserve declined from 13.9 per cent in 1962 to 9.3 per cent in 1963.",
