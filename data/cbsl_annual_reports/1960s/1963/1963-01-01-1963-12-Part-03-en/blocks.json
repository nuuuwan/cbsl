The obverse side of the new coins carries the Armorial Ensigns of Ceylon, with the reverse side carrying in the centre the value in figures, and in words in Sinhala, Tamil and English between designs derived from the \"Liyawela\" motif in Sinhala Art. The new 50 cents and 25 cents coins are minted in cupro-nickel, and the new 2 cents and 1 cent coins in an aluminium alloy. The new 10 cents and 5 cents coins are minted in the same nickel-brass alloy as the coins of these denominations in the earlier design.",
