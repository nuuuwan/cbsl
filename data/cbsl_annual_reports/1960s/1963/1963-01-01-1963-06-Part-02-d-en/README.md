(D) EMPLOYMENT AND LABOUR RELATIONS

Employment

In the absence of annual aggregate data the only rough indicator of the annual movement in the level of unemployment is the data relating to the number of regis­trants at employment exchanges. At the end of 1962, the number of registrants at employment exchanges was 0.6 per cent higher than at the end of the previous year. These numbers have been slightly higher during the first, third and fourth quarters of 1963. At the end of December 1963, however, the number of registrants fell to 151,922 compared with 152,209 at the end of December 1962. During the course of the year there was an increase in registration by persons seeking technical and clerical employment, so that at the end of the year these registrants numbered 6.2 per cent more than at the end of December 1962. The number of semi-skilled registrants too increased slightly by 1.8 per cent while numbers registered as skilled and unskilled declined steadily during the course of the year and were 4.4 per cent and 3.5 per cent lower respectively than at the end of December 1962. Complete data relating to employment created in 1963 in the Government sector, semi-Government Corporation and the private sector are not available.

The following table shows the number of persons who have been placed in employment in recent years together with the percentage which such placements bear to total registrants on the books in each category.

The number of persons placed in employment during 1963, though slightly higher than in 1962, has been somewhat smaller than in recent years. The largest number of persons placed has been in the unskilled category. The percentage of persons placed to total registrants has also been highest in this category namely 3.9 per cent. The percentage of placings to total registrants among technical and clerical registrants was a close second. These percentages were generally equal to or higher than those for the previous year among all categories of workers.

Labour Relations

The data on strikes serve as a partial indicator of the changes in employer-employee relations. The Table below shows the number of strikes, the number of workers involved and the number of man-days lost as a result of strikes.

In 1963 the number of strikes on plantations was considerably higher than in 1962 while the number of strikes in other employments fell. The plantation sector, where the major part of the working population organised in unions is employed, continued to record the largest number of strikes. About 74.8 per cent of plantation workers are members of unions and their, number constitute about 56.1 per cent of all employees, who are members of unions. In 1963, the number of strikes on plantations and other employments totalled 171 and 46 compared with 138 and 50 respectively in 1962. In the plantation sector the number of workers involved and man-days lost was also larger than in the previous year. In other employments the number of workers involved were smaller. These figures do not include the data relating to the Port Cargo Corporation strike. This strike was initially called among workers in the non-labour grades. The number of such workers on strike rose from 377 in November, 1963 to 1117 at the end of the year, resulting in a loss of 48,693 man-days by these workers. 524 workers belonging to the labour grades joined the strikers on December 27, 1963. The number of man-days lost by these labour grades up to the end of December totalled 1,237 and represented 0.7 per cent of the monthly average number of man-days worked.

Strikes in the plantation sector lasted on an average 5.8 days in 1963, com­pared with an average of 4.6 days in 1962. Strikes in other employments are generally longer drawn out than on plantations. The duration of these strikes were reduced sharply from an average of 31.2 days in 1962 to 11.5 days in 1963.

Looking at the reasons given for striking according to the classification made by the Department of Labour, estate rules, discipline, working arrangements etc. accounted for 33.7 per cent, dismissal or loss of employment for 18.8 per cent and wage disputes such as non-payment and delay in payment of wages for 8.4 per cent of strikes and these took place mainly on plantations. Demands for wage increases accounted for 2.5 per cent of the strikes.
