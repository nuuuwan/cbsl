At the end of 1962, the number of registrants at employment exchanges was 0.6 per cent higher than at the end of the previous year. These numbers have been slightly higher during the first, third and fourth quarters of 1963. At the end of December 1963, however, the number of registrants fell to 151,922 compared with 152,209 at the end of December 1962. During the course of the year there was an increase in registration by persons seeking technical and clerical employment, so that at the end of the year these registrants numbered 6.2 per cent more than at the end of December 1962. The number of semi-skilled registrants too increased slightly by 1.8 per cent while numbers registered as skilled and unskilled declined steadily during the course of the year and were 4.4 per cent and 3.5 per cent lower respectively than at the end of December 1962. Complete data relating to employment created in 1963 in the Government sector, semi-Government Corporation and the private sector are not available.",

    "text": "In 1963 the number of strikes on plantations was considerably higher than in 1962 while the number of strikes in other employments fell. The plantation sector, where the major part of the working population organised in unions is employed, continued to record the largest number of strikes. About 74.8 per cent of plantation workers are members of unions and their, number constitute about 56.1 per cent of all employees, who are members of unions. In 1963, the number of strikes on plantations and other employments totalled 171 and 46 compared with 138 and 50 respectively in 1962. In the plantation sector the number of workers involved and man-days lost was also larger than in the previous year. In other employments the number of workers involved were smaller. These figures do not include the data relating to the Port Cargo Corporation strike. This strike was initially called among workers in the non-labour grades. The number of such workers on strike rose from 377 in November, 1963 to 1117 at the end of the year, resulting in a loss of 48,693 man-days by these workers. 524 workers belonging to the labour grades joined the strikers on December 27, 1963. The number of man-days lost by these labour grades up to the end of December totalled 1,237 and represented 0.7 per cent of the monthly average number of man-days worked.",
