    "text": "In 1963, Ceylon's Gross National Product at current prices increased, according to provisional estimates, by 4.8 per cent. In real terms, however, i.e. at constant prices, the increase in Gross National Product during the year was only 1.8 per cent. When allowance is made for the increase in population, real product per person declined in 1963 by Q.8 per cent. The rate of increase in total Gross National Product in real terms was smaller in 1963 than in the previous year. This was the result of a decline in production in the export sector and a smaller rate of increase in production in the domestic sector. Industrial production, however, continued to expand signi\u00adficantly in 1963. Domestic rice production also increased during the year, but the rate of increase in production was 2.3 per cent in 1963 as against 11.3 per cent in 1962.",

    "text": "In 1963 the Ceylon economy had to face many forces of an unfavourable nature. The monetary expansion of the earlier years and the consequent decline in external Reserves had resulted in the need to maintain extensive restrictions on imports, so as to ease the pressures on Ceylon's balance of payments. In 1963 there were indications of relative scarcities and rising prices in respect of several categories of imported goods. These developments, moreover, were accentuated by a deterioration in Ceylon's terms of trade during the year on account of a rise in import prices. During the latter part of the year, in particular, there was a sharp increase in the external price of rice, flour and specially sugar\u2014items imported and sold by the Government itself. Since these price increases were not passed on to the domestic consumer and since there was the need to sustain consumer supplies, these developments led to further pressures on Ceylon's balance of payments and on the Government's budgetary position.",

    "text": "In the financial year 1962-63 there was a reduction in the overall cash deficit in the Government budget and in the extent of financing from expansionary sources. The overall cash deficit in 1962-63 was Rs. 391.7 million as against Rs. 456.1 million in 1961-62 and the extent of expansionary financing Rs. 162.0 million as against Rs. 190.4 million. The reduction in the overall cash deficit in 1962-63, was largely the outcome of a reduction in loans to Government agencies for capital outlays. During that year, however, there were significant increases in subscriptions to Government loans from non-bank sources and in receipts from foreign aid. The budget for the current financial year, 1963-64, sought to limit the extent of financing from expansionary sources to Rs. 54.5 million. However, this objective \u2022would be affected by the rise in external food prices during the latter part of 1963 which is estimated to result in an increase of Rs. 167.0 million in the food bill.",

    "text": "1963 saw a sharp increase in the tbtal of commercial bank credit to the private sector, Government corporations and agencies. This was largely the result of an extension of credit by the Ceylonese banks. In previous years the expansionary effects of Government finance and commercial bank credit to the private sector on the money supply were offset to a large extent by a decline in net external banking assets. In 1963, with the maintenance of import restrictions, the contractive effects of this factor were reduced. In consequence, the total money supply increased by 12.3 per cent during the year as compared to an increase of 4.2 per cent in the previous year. This occurred despite a substantial increase in time and savings deposits.",

The gross value of the total output of these industries increased by Rs. 44.7 million in 1963. A substantial part of the increase in total production was due to the expansion of output in three industries, viz., garments, biscuit confectionery, and metal products. The survey also analyses the distribution of firms within industries in terms of the size of output and of the total wage bill. These results provide, for the first time, a picture of the emergent structure of industry in Ceylon.",

The extent of the increase in prices cannot be precisely measured in the absence of an appropriate index of wholesale or retail prices. The Colombo Consumers' Price Index, which is limited in coverage and in which subsidised items enjoy a relatively heavy weightage, increased by 2.4 per cent during the year. But there were indications that the increase in prices was sharper particularly in respect of many items outside the Index. Similarly, there are no precise data to measure changes in total supplies of imported goods. The index of the overall volume of imports declined by 14.1 per cent during the year. But here again, the absence of data on the availability of stocks, and limitations in the index itself, precludes an accurate assessment of the actual variation in total supplies of imported goods.",

The increase in the general level of prices over the entire post-war period has been more moderate in Ceylon than in most countries. Yet, it is important to recognise that this record was largely the result of Ceylon's ability to adapt supplies of goods to changes in demand through the relatively free movement of imports. Imports constitute a high proportion of the total of resources available for consump\u00adtion and investment in the economy and, in conditions where imports flow in freely, changes in the internal price level are more a reflection of changes in prices abroad than of changes in domestic demand. With the need to restrict imports, however, the situation is altered basically and the factor which contributed towards price stability in the past would no longer be in operation. In this situation, it is not possible to postulate the automatic continuance of the trends of the earlier period, and the course of the domestic price level would now depend on the success with which domestic demand is adapted to the total availability of supplies.",

But, although there are no accurate data on changes in import stocks, it was evident that the moderating influence of this factor was weakened in 1963. Similarly, the effects on prices of a restriction in supplies of imported goods could be offset by the availability of domestically produced substitutes. There has been an undoubted increase in the manufactures of import substitutes over the last two years.

    "text": "Secondly, the decline in the terms of trade reacted adversely on the overall budgetary position of the Government, particularly during the last quarter of 1963. During this period there was a rise in the external price of foodstuffs imported by Government and sold at subsidised or fixed prices. The external prices of rice, flour and sugar all showed an upward trend during 1963. The increase in sugar prices was particularly sharp. Since the local retail prices of these items were not increased in turn, these changes would result in an increase in the Government food subsidy bill and in a corresponding enlargement in the budget deficit. The magnitude of expan\u00adsionary financing would thereby be increased and this must further aggravate the inflationary pressures on domestic prices in the economy unless such expansionary financing was wholly offset by a decline in external assets. The rise is food prices, however, would mainly affect the financial year 1963-64 which includes the last quarter of 1963.",

    "text": "Ceylon, in common with most developing countries, has suffered from sharp fluctuations in the terms of trade over the post-war period. The index of Ceylon's terms of trade (base 1958=100) rose to a peak of 114 in 1950 following the Korean war and declined to a trough of 84 in 1952. In 1955, again, following a marked rise in tea prices, the index of Ceylon's terms of trade rose to 112. But by 1957 it had declined to 94. There were mild upturns in 1958 and 1959 as in 1962 but in 1963, as mentioned, the index had fallen to 89. Unfavourable movements in the terms of trade partially negatived the beneficial effects of increases in the volume of output of Ceylon's export products. Between 1948 and 1963 Ceylon's total export volumes increased at an annual average rate of 2.1 per cent. Yet, owing to movements in the terms of trade the purchasing power of Ceylon's exports (i.e. export values deflated by the index of import prices) increased at an average annual rate of only 0.9 per cent during the same period.",

The continued monetary expansion in the recent period had already created a situation in which imports had to be restricted and inflationary pressures on the price level were increasing. The decline in the terms of trade helped to accelerate this process by increasing the strains on the country's balance of payments and on the budgetary position of Government. There were also other factors of an unfavourable nature. A decline in the total production of export crops affected export earnings, whilst a smaller increase in domestic rice production, relative to 1962, led to a reduction in stocks and to larger imports of rice. The Port strike occurring towards the end of the year further intensified Ceylon's difficulties by reducing the flow of exports and by increasing outlays on demurrage and freight.",

They had declined from Rs. 1229 million at the end of 1955 to Rs. 504 million at the end of 1962 \u2014 largely in consequence of the sustained demand for imports generated by the overall deficits in the Govern\u00adment budget. In 1963, Ceylon was able to incur and finance a deficit in the balance of payments on current account through a further reduction in her external assets and through an increase in external liabilities. In other words, Ceylon did not, in 1963, reduce her imports to the full extent of the decline in the purchasing power of her exports. But the further fall in external reserves and the increase in external liabilities, particularly short term liabilities, during the year placed Ceylon's external reserves in a position in which there remains but little leeway for meeting future adverse fluctuation. If the terms of trade were to remain relatively unfavourable, Ceylon would have little alternative but to curtail imports still further or to increase her external liabilities. However, unless overall monetary demand is also curtailed, the reduction in imports would result in a further intensification of shortages and of inflationary pressures on the price level. An increase in external liabilities would merely make possible a postponement of this process.",

    "text": "It is true that most developing countries have, like Ceylon, experienced a running down of reserves during the course of the nineteen fifties. This was partly associated with a deterioration in the terms of trade, and was partly due to the efforts of these countries at accelerating the pace of development. A rising tempo of economic growth often requires increased imports of machinery and,equipment, raw materials, and even consumer goods. Where external receipts do not rise sufficiently, such countries have little alternative but to resort to a drawing down of the external reserves they possess. These factors were of relevance to Ceylon's experience as well. But the decline in Ceylon's external reserves and the overall budgetary deficits of Government which were causally associated with it were as much the outcome of increases in consump\u00adtion as of capital formation. In fact, in recent years, both in the Government sector and in the economy as a whole the increases in consumption expenditure have been more notable than the increases in capital formation. It needs to be recognised, more\u00adover, that the use of reserves, even for the financing of development is a \"once and for all\" process. Once they have been utilised, external outlays have to be matched by external receipts and the country's monetary and fiscal policies have to be adapted to achieving this objective without an excessive inflation in prices. Furthermore, it has also to be recognised that a drawing down of external reserves, even when occasioned by a development effort, should not prudently exceed the limits of a minimum level necessary to cope with possible fluctuations in external receipts and outlays. For a country like Ceylon whose balance of payments is highly susceptible to movements in external prices and where external trade plays a large part in the total of economic activity, this minimum must necessarily be larger in relative terms to what would be needed by less \"open\" economies. External reserves serve to cushion the economy against the impact of external fluctuations. Where they are inadequate, external payments would need to be continously adapted\u2014even over the shortest period\u2014 to changes in external receipts. This may result in dislocations which affect supplies not only of consumer goods but of machinery, equipment and industrial raw materials.",

This was, however, lower than the merchandise deficit of Rs. 143 million in the preceding year despite a reduction in export earnings in 1963. The fall in the merchandise deficit was entirely due to a contraction in import outlays. Nevertheless, though the merchandise deficit was reduced, Ceylon's total current account deficit in 1963 was slightly higher than in 1962. This was due to an increase in the net deficit on service items, mainly on account of reduced earnings from the Port of Colombo and from reduced interest receipts on external assets.",

    "text": "The reduction in import outlays in 1963, in the context of the rise in import prices, provides some indication of the extent to which the physical volume of imports was reduced during the year. Ceylon's total payments for imports declined by Rs. 52 million from Rs. 1906 million in 1962 to Rs. 1854 million in 1963. The index of import prices, however, rose by 10.5 per cent between 1962 and 1963. Although the accuracy of the index is limited by several factors,1 there is nevertheless little doubt that there was a significant increase in import prices during the year and that for this reason the reduction in the physical supplies of imports was greater than is suggested by the decline in import payments alone. Other data confirm this picture. Although total import payments declined by Rs. 52 million in 1963, import outlays by the private sector and government corporations fell by Rs. 145 million despite the rise in import prices. On the other hand government food payments increased",

Receipts of long term capital including private capital, rose to Rs. 79 million in 1963 and financed a considerably larger proportion of the current account deficit than in preceding years. An increase in long term external liabilities as a source of finance for the current account deficit is a normal phenomenon in most developing countries. It would result, where the terms of borrowing are favourable and where it is associated with development projects and programmes, in a strength\u00adening of the future economy and of the balance of payments. It is essentially the deficit on current account exclusive of such long term borrowing, that necessitates a reduction in external assets or an increase in external short term liabilities. Ceylon's current account deficit, exclusive of long term capital receipts both official and private, was Rs. 73 million in 1963. This was financed by a drawing down of external assets by Rs. 42 million and by increasing Ceylon's official and private short term external liabilities\u2014by Rs. 31 million. The increase in official short term liabilities mainly represented amounts owed by Ceylon under bilateral agreements,",

Yet, on account of the relatively low level to which external assets had already fallen and in the absence of any indication regarding the occurrence, timing, and extent of any future improvements in the terms of trade, even the smaller total deficit of 1963 was a matter for concern. Unless there was to be a marked improvement in the future terms of trade or recourse to further short term borrowing, the repayment of short iterm debts1 implies that imports or external assets would need to be reduced further. Ceylon's total external liabilities increased from Rs. 473 -9 million in 1962 to Rs. 588.7 million in 1963. Official short term liabilities increased from Rs. 118.2 million to Rs. 157.6 million over the same period and official long term liabilities from Rs. 355.7 million to Rs. 431.1 million.",

This was made up of the International Reserve of the Central Bank Rs. 114.2 million, the balances of commercial banks Rs. 105.3 million, and investments of Government and Government agencies, Rs. 139.3 million. Ceylon's external assets net of sterling loans sinking funds, represented 19 per cent of the value of imports in 1963. In 1962 the corresponding ratio was 21 per cent. Rs. 66.0 million of the International Reserve at the end of 1963 consisted of investments in foreign securities and Rs. 48.2 million liquid or near liquid assets. Rs. 15.3 million of the liquid assets comprised bilateral payment agreement balances due to Ceylon. The decline in the Interna-",

In fact, since the financial year 1960/61 the extent of financing from expansionary sources had declined moderately. Hence, whilst the extent of expansio\u00adnary financing of the budget reached a peak of Rs. 251.1 million in the financial year 1959/60, it declined to Rs. 233.9 million in 1960/61 and to Rs. 190.4 miUion in 1961/62. These results were achieved despite a continued increase in total expen\u00additures, both current and capital, and were made possible by substantial increases in revenues resulting from strenuous efforts in the field of taxation, and by increased borrowings from non-bank sources, both domestic and foreign.",

During the presentation of the budget for 1963-64, the Minister of Finance announced the formulation of a foreign exchange budget in terms of which total external outlays during the financial year 1963-64 were to be confined to the level of anticipated external receipts, involving thereby no change in external assets over the year as a whole. On February 13, 1964 the Minister announced a revision of the foreign exchange budget to take account of increased external outlays for foodstuffs, fertilizers and demurrage. In terms of the revised foreign exchange budget there would be reductions in other external outlays and increases in foreign aid to partly compensate for these increases. A decline of Rs. 57 million in external assets over the financial year 1963-64 as a whole was anticipated in the light of these revisions, (cf Hansard, February 13, 1964.)",

These declines were partially offset by profits from the sale of arrack which increased by Rs. 26 million,1 increased revenues from the tobacco tax amounting to Rs. 17.5 million, and higher collections from the surcharge on income tax which rose by Rs. 11.1 million. There were also smaller increases in revenues under other heads. The reduction in import duty receipts was undoubtedly the result of the restrictions on imports, whilst the fall in export duty collection, and to some extent of income tax receipts as well, was a reflection of lower export earnings and producer incomes. The large revenues accruing to Government from local excises on tobacco and liquor are notable. In 1962/63 the total receipts from these items amounted to Rs. 210.8 million. In the same year the total collection from income tax, inclusive of the surcharge, was Rs. 258.8 million.",

In previous years, however, the effects of the fiscal expansion on the liquid resources of the commercial banks were substantially offset by the increased outlays on imports and the adverse balance of payments position. With the introduction of import restrictions the offsetting influence of this factor was reduced and the liquid resources of the banks tended to increase more rapidly. There can be little doubt that the expansion in credit by the commercial banks in 1963 was associated with these influences.",

First, it is necessary to ensure that the increase in credit is primarily for productive rather than for consumption purposes and that financing for the speculative holding of stocks is minimised. Second, it is also important to ensure that the total of credit expansion is not excessive in the light of the overall monetary situation on the one hand, and the needs of productive activities on the other. It needs to be recognised that even credit for productive purposes could, if excessive, result in an intensification of inflationary pressures in the short term. During 1963, there was no direct evidence of an increase in credit for speculative or consumption purposes. As already indicated, the total of advances classified as advances for purposes of consumption declined during 1963. Nevertheless, it is possible that some loans, specially in the smaller categories, taken for production, trading, or miscellaneous purposes were utilized for consumption.",

The rate of increase in the money supply was considerably in excess of the rates of increase experienced in recent years. In 1960, 1961 and 1962, for instance, the rates of increase in the money supply were 2.6 per cent, 6.6 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively. In earlier years tod,:the total value of the expansionist factors was large, mainly on account of deficits in the Government budget. But their effects on the money supply were substantially offset by large reductions in external banking assets. In 1963 the fall in external assets, though sizeable, was of a lower order than before on account of the restrictions on imports, and this weakened the offsetting influence of this factor on the total money supply. The increase in Government cash balances in 1963, by Rs. 8.3 million was also less than the corresponding increase in the previous year 1962 of Rs. 76.1 million.",

    "text": "One of the significant features of 1963, as well as of 1962, was the large increase in time and savings deposits. Time and savings deposits increased by Rs. 63.4 million in i963 and Rs. 62.6 million in 1962. These increases served to cushion the impact of the expansionary factors on the money supply and compensated in this way for the reduced fall in external banking assets. The increases in time and savings deposits were largely due to increases in holdings by individuals, non-business ins\u00adtitutions and trading concerns. It is difficult to be certain as to the extent to which the increase in time and savings deposits represents an increase in genuine savings. Although the rate of turnover of these deposits is considerably smaller than the rate of turnover of demand deposits, the former has tended to increase in recent times. In any event, time and savings deposits constitute a relatively liquid form of holding savings.",

It pointed out, in the first instance, that the sustained decline in external assets that resulted from such an expansion would leave the economy in a weaker position for coping with external fluctuations and that such fluctuations are not in any sense a new pheno\u00admenon for Ceylon. It also pointed out that attempts to safeguard external assets by direct restrictions on imports without parallel action to reduce the quantum of monetary expansion cannot but result in inflationary pressures on prices and in the emergence of shortages, scarcities and rigidities of various kinds. The develop\u00adments of 1963, accentuated as they were by the adverse movements in the terms of trade, amply confirmed this analysis. It is not that 1963 witnessed the emergence of anything like the extremes of inflation which have beenknown to occur elsewhere. It is rather that in 1963 the departure from Ceylon's previous experience of relative price stability was more strongly marked than in the years immediately preceding and that in that year the repercussions of the sustained monetary expansion were beginning to be more clearly felt than before.",

Despite the adverse developments in the monetary sphere, the relatively slow rate of economic growth, and the weakened position in respect of external assets, the Ceylon economy has a substantial potential for future progress. Standards of living or levels of per capita income are higher in Ceylon than in many other developing countries. Ceylon receives substantial earnings of foreign exchange through an export sector which is large in relation to national income, and which has shown a capacity-specially in the case of tea-for sustained expansion in recent years. There have also been welcome signs of a growth in the productive capacity of her domestic agriculture where the potential for further development remains great. Most evident of all, a significant beginning has been made in the process of industrial development which, if effectively carried forward, could signify a transformation in the basic structure of the Ceylon economy. All these and other advantages provide an opportunity for rapid progress. But its full utilization could be jeopardized by an excessive imbalance in the monetary field which, if allowed to persist too long, could gain in momentum and give rise to tendencies which could hamper the productive process itself.",

As prices increase those whose money incomes are fixed or do not increase in propor\u00adtion to the rise in prices are able to purchase smaller quantities than before and suffer a contraction in real income and consumption. On the other hand, those whose money incomes rise faster than the rise in prices enjoy an improvement in real income. In other words, in a process of inflation or rising prices there is a shift in the distribution of real income against the relatively fixed money income groups and in favour of those whose money incomes increase as a result of rising scarcity profits or other factors. Speculative activities, in particular, benefit from the process. It is essentially through such shifts in real incomes brought about in this way that a reduced quantity of real resources is distributed throughout the commu\u00adnity in an inflationary process.",

A rise in prices generated by such a process is not likely to remain static at higher levels. As prices increase there are pressures for compensatory increases in money incomes. Wage and salary earners, for instance, are likely to exert pressures for higher money earnings. The increases, however, if conceded are likely to prove self defeating. Although wage increases may confer temporary benefits they result in increases in costs which are in turn transmitted to consumers, including wage and salary earners, in the form of a further rise in prices and living costs. A cumulative spiral of rising prices, wages and costs could be set in motion over a period in this manner.",

The existence of shortages and scarcities and the expectation of further increases in prices encourages the speculative hoarding of stocks of goods which itself aggra\u00advates the actual rise in prices. It is, in fact, the new pattern of expectations created by a price inflation that is a particularly insidious feature of the process and which, once under way, makes difficult a policy of restraint. Where further increases in prices are anticipated even increases in supplies find their way into speculative hoards. It has to be recognised that there are several limitations in the way of successful price control and distribution policies in a general situation of excess demand. Price controls themselves tend to multiply and to make necessary an ever increasing network of controls over supplies and distribution. Price controls unaccom\u00adpanied by effective rationing invariably result in either the circumvention of the controls or the disappearance of supplies from the market. Where available supplies fall short of demand at the controlled prices, scarcities cannot but occur. Yet, a compre\u00adhensive system of rationing places great strains on the administration which a deve\u00adloping country can ill afford to bear. Moreover, the administrative costs of price controls and rationing are an additional component to the normal charges of dis\u00adtribution which needs to be borne by the budget.",

Such a reduction would result in a restraining of inflationary trends. An approach of this kind, however, must not be limited to the mere attainment of relative price stability. It must also be linked with the provision of a framework for accelerated economic growth. There will always be some scope in a developing economy for a certain degree of monetary expansion consistent, for instance, with the increases in production that take place from year to year.

Nevertheless, the heavy claims made by current expenditures on the financial resources of Govern\u00adment set limits to the magnitude of resources that could be devoted to investment. At the same time, as already discussed, there are limits to the amount of financial resources for accelerated investment that could be prudently provided by expansio\u00adnary financing.",

    "text": "The policy requirements for the mobilization of domestic financial resources would be readily apparent in the perspective of a development plan which sets out the investment requirements for an accelerated rate of economic growth. Given the magnitudes for external financing and permissible monetary expansion, the objectives in respect of Government revenues and current expenditures would be more easily determined. The question of an appropriate scale of subsidy outlays, for instance, could be approached in terms of such a framework. It needs to be recognised in this connection that in the more recent period the relationship between subsidies, budget deficits and the price level has changed significantly. As long as -external reserves were plentiful and imports flowed in freely, expansionist financing of Government budgets, whether for the maintenance of subsidies or otherwise, had no impact on consumer prices or living costs. The cost of subsidies, in other words, was not borne by consumers through increases in other prices but by the decline in external reserves. In the present situation, on the other hand, although the prices of subsidised items remain low, excessive expansionary financing results in a sustained increase in other consumer prices as well as in shortages of several categories of goods. A development plan will not only indicate in specific terms the appropriate allocation of resources between consumption and investment, it will also depict the scope for further augmenting revenue. As previous Annual Reports have stressed, instruments of taxation in a developing economy, need to be progressively adapted towards channelling to revenue a part of the increment to incomes that accrue in the course of development and particularly a part of what would otherwise be diverted to consumption. Further, in conditions of relative scarcities high import duties, sales or turnover taxes, and excise duties, are effective instruments for aug. menting revenues and reducing scarcity profits.",
