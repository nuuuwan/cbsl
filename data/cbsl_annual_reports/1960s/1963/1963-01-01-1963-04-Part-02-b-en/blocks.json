There could also be considerable differences between the physical movement of goods and their recorded movement, if Customs entries were not passed simultaneously with the clearance of goods or as expeditiously as possible thereafter. Such differences have been particularly pronounced in the case of Government imports (and especially food imports, which account for so large a proportion of total imports), in regard to which there is often a long interval between the clearance of goods and the passing of the relative entries. The elimination of this interval, or its reduction to negligible proportions, could enhance considerably the value of Customs data and their usefulness for purposes of economic analysis.",

In addition, certain employees of the Customs Department, both in Colombo and the other ports in the island, also went on strike during the first half of December 19631. While labour engaged directly in the discharging and loading of import and export cargoes was barely affected by these strikes, it is evident that these strikes affected adversely the flow of exports and imports during the last two months of the year. The value of exports showed a decline of Rs. 46 million in December as compared to the average of the previous eleven months, which was more than could be accounted for on grounds of price, weather or seasonal factors. There can be little doubt that unsettled conditions in the Port of Colombo have had a deleterious effect on the country's economy.",

The separate indices for the various categories of imports show that the decline affected all such categories. The decline was 16.7 per cent in the 'consumergoods' group, while the declines in the 'intermediate goods' and 'investment goods' groups were 5.3 per cent and 19.8 per cent respectively. Within the 'consumer goods' group, the 'food and drink' sub-group recorded the smallest decline, viz., 5.6 per cent, while the 'textiles' and 'other consumer goods' sub-groups declined very sharply by 43.2 per cent and 44.4 per cent respectively.",

    "text": "In 1963 tea production increased by 18 million pounds or 3.9 per cent, as compared to a rate of increase of 2.6 per cent during the previous year. Exports, however, expanded by only 4 million pounds (0.9 per cent). The rate of expansion compared unfavourably with that of 1962, viz., 6.1 per cent, and indeed with those of 1961 and 1960, viz., 3.9 per cent and 6.8 per cent respectively. Prices continued to be unsatisfactory, the average annual prices of all grades of tea sold at the Colombo Auctions declining by 7 cents per pound or 4 per cent as compared with 1962. This decline affected all the three principal grades of tea. High growns declined most, viz., by 12 cents per pound or 5.9 per cent, while medium growns and low growns declined by 7 cents per pound (4.3 per cent) and 3 cents per pound (1.9 per cent) respectively. The average price of high growns declined in every quarter of the year as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1962. Medium growns showed a modest improvement during the first quarter, but thereafter registered a progressive decline. Low growns appeared to have fared best, as compared with the corresponding quarters of the previous year, average quarterly prices improving slightly during the first half of the year, and declining less sharply during the second half than in the case of the other two grades. The fall in the average prices of each grade of tea in the third and fourth quarters of the year reflects in some measure the increasing pressure of local supplies as well as seasonal variations in quality. Nevertheless, there does appear to be evidence that the entry into the market of plain teas, of poor leaf appearance or unattractive liquor and not sufficiently well made, has also had on occasion a depressing effect on prices.",

In 1962 world supplies amounted to 1,637 million pounds.2 World consumption accounted for 1,629 million pounds, leaving an excess of supplies over absorption of 8 million pounds. Complete production data in respect of 1963 are still not available, but the indications are that world production in this year will exceed that of 1962. There have been short-falls in production in North-East India and Indonesia, but these have been made good by increases in output in South India, Ceylon and (to a lesser extent) East Africa. Imports during the year into the United Kingdom, the principal consuming country, amounted to 563 million pounds,3 an increase of 6 million pounds over 1962. It is likely that the excess of supplies over absorption will be larger in 1963 than in 1962 but, perhaps, not suffi\u00adciently large to upset the present broad equilibrium of supply and demand.",

Unless, therefore, world consumption keeps pace with increasing output the prospect of over-production, particularly of plain teas, may well be a factor of importance in the future. In these circumstances, if Ceylon is to maintain her position and competitiveness in the world's markets, concentration on productivity, in the sense only of low unit costs and high yields, may not by itself provide an adequate answer. Emphasis on quality and on good, well made teas, irrespective of the elevations at which they are produced, will also need to be an important objective.",

This slight expansion, which compared unfavourably with the previous year's increase of 6.5 per cent, is in some measure due to adverse weather conditions which affected production, particularly during the latter half of the year. The quantity exported during the year, on the other hand, declined by 15 million pounds or 6.7 per cent. During 1962 this quantity had expanded by 13.7 per cent. In the Colombo market, the average price of R.S.S. No. 1 rubber for the year reached a low level of 93 cents per pound, the lowest after 1958. The decline in price over 1962 was 5 cents per pound or 5.1 per cent.",

Particular events, however, tended to exert some influence on this general situation. The signing of the partial nuclear test ban treaty by the major powers towards the middle of the year did tend to ease prices. The reduction by 2 U.S. dollar cents per pound in the price of Cis-Polybutadiene synthetic rubber made at the end of April, and further reductions in the prices of two other synthetic rubbers announced in September of the year, also had a depressing effect on the price of natural rubber. On the other hand, certain other factors, viz., political tension between the newly established State of Malaysia and Indonesia and periodical Russian purchases of natural rubber in the primary markets, tended to strengthen otherwise sagging prices.",

These estimates suggest further that world consumption of synthetic rubber, at 2,317,500 tons, has also outpaced, for the first time, world consumption of natural rubber which is estimated at 2,200,000 tons. Moreover, with the increase in synthetic plant capacity in many of the industrialized countries in the wake of their expanding oil refining and petro-chemical industries, increasing quantities of the new stereo rubbers, substitutable for natural rubber in a wider range of applications than ever before, are being made available on a commercial scale to consumers in these countries.",

Indeed, these tendencies are likely to gain greater momentum in the future and the price of natural rubber may even fall further, depending on the ability of producers of synthetic rubber to reduce their costs of production and effect further improvements in the technical properties of their product. Future prices may, nevertheless, well prove to be more stable, since factory output of synthetic rubber could, unlike in the case of the plantation product, be readily adjusted to changes in demand.",

In the Colombo market, both copra and coconut oil opened the year with a firm outlook and with prices well above those obtaining a year earlier. Indeed, prices in every quarter of the year continued to maintain this relative improvement, the reduced availability ,of supplies, as compared with the corresponding quarters of 1962, lending considerable support to prices. From September the prices of both commodities rose more sharply, this improvement lasting till about the end of the year, when prices tended to decline.",

There was an increase in European demand to compensate for the shortfall in olive oil production, and the price increase affected particularly soyabean oil, the major soft oil.

In the last quarter of the year the prices of most vegetable oils showed sharp increases, following speculation that the U.S.S.R's purchases of wheat in the United States would lead to purchases of vegetable oils as well, in view of the reported shortfall in sunflower seed and other oilseed production in the countries of the Eastern European bloc. The latter purchases failed to materia\u00adlize, however, and prices reacted adversely towards the close of the year.",

The low level, for the most part of the year, of European stocks of these products (which had been run down considerably during 1962) helped sustain prices, especially in the wake of reports that adverse weather was affecting coconut production in the Philippines. The suspension, later in the year, of Indonesian exports of copra to Malaysia, and the consequent ban imposed by Malaysia on exports of copra and coconut oil, also had a favourable effect on prices. However, by the year-end there appeared to be evidence that the reports of adverse weather affecting production in the Philippines were being falsified by actual events, and that exports from that country had, in fact, increased during the closing months of the year. This fact, together with the rising level of European stocks, tended to depress prices.",

In 1963 these imports declined to Rs. 648 million or 43 per cent of the year's imports, a reduction of Rs. 159 million as compared to the corresponding imports of the previous year.
