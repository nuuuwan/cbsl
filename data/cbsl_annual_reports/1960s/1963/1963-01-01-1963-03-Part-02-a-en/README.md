II. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL TRENDS—1963

(A) National Product and Expenditure

Introduction

According to provisional estimates, gross national product at current factor cost prices increased from Rs. 6,418 million in 1962 to Rs. 6,727 million in 1963. The rate of increase in 1963 at 4.8 per cent is higher than the rate of increase of 4.5 per cent in 1962 (revised estimates) and well above the average rate of increase of 3.1 per cent in the years 1960-1962.

In terms of constant1 prices, gross national product in 1963 was 1.8 per cent higher than in 1962. This rate of increase was, however, lower than the rate of increase in 1962. Thus, while the rate of increase in money national product in 1963 has been higher than that in 1962, the rate of increase in real national product has been some­what lower. Available data indicate that in 1963 there was a decline in the net output of the export sector. The value of domestic exports which had shown an increase of 5.1 per cent in 1962 showed a decline of 3.5 per cent in 1963. The change in the volume of exports as reflected in the estimates at constant prices amounted to a decline of 3.9 per cent in 1963. This was due largely to a decline in the volume of coconut exports and to a lesser extent to a decline in the volume of rubber exports; the volume of tea exports having risen moderately. However, the position as regards export stocks which had declined markedly in 1962 showed an overall increase in 1963. The net output of the export sector taking into account in addition to the value of exports, the increased value of changes in stocks, fell by 1.5 per cent in money terms and by 1.9 per cent in real terms.

In view of the decline in the net output of the export sector, the increase in the gross national product is wholly attributable to an increase in the net output of the domestic sector. At current prices the rate of increase in 1963 was 6.7 per cent as compared to the increase of 5.7 per cent in 1962. At constant prices the rate of increase in 1963 was 3.1 per cent as compared to an increase of 4.2 per cent in 1962. The main contribution to the expansion in the domestic sector came from industry, capital development in public enterprises and fisheries. Paddy production which had increased by 11.3 per cent in 1962 increased by only 2.3 per cent in 1963.

Total gross national expenditure at current market prices composed of expenditure on consumption and capital formation rose fromRs. 6,872 million in 1962 to Rs. 7,161 million in 1963, an increase of 4.2 per cent. Total capital formation declined but consumption expenditure increased to more than offset the fall in capital formation. In regard to consumption expenditure, outlays on imported goods declined, but expenditure on locally produced goods increased, more than offsetting the fall in expenditure on imported goods. The fall in consumption expenditure on imported goods is attributable to the import restrictions imposed in 1962 and 1963,

In 1963, overall import prices increased, while export prices remained unchanged. There was in consequence an adverse movement in the terms of trade. An adverse movement in the terms of trade reduces the quantum of imports which could be obtained per unit of exports. Such a movement in the terms of trade in an export-import economy, therefore, reduces the exchange value of total goods and services produced i.e. real national income. Estimates of real product when adjusted for the changes in the terms of trade provide estimates of real national income. While an increase in the real product provides an index of the increase in the volume

( 21 )

( 22 )

of goods and services produced, an increase in the real national income would be an appropriate measure of the increase in resources available to the country, through production and through international exchange. In 1963, real product recorded an increase of 1.8 per cent. However, on account of the deterioration in the terms of trade, real national income decreased by 0.7 per cent. This is in contrast to the experience of 1962. In that year, both real product and real income increased and the rate of increase in real national income was even larger than that in the real product since there was an improvement in the terms of trade.

The per capita money product which had increased from Rs. 604 in 1961 to Rs. 615 in 1962 rose to Rs. 628 in 1963. The rate of increase in the per capita money product in 1963 was 2.1 per cent. The per capita real product in 1963 was Rs. 617 as against Rs. 622 in 1962, a fall of 0.8 per cent as against a rise of 1.0 per cent in 1962.

Definition of Items:

1. Government [items II (iii) (a) and II (vii)] is defined to cover Central and Local Government, but to exclude public cor­porations and Government enterprises (i.e. the Railway, Electrical Undertakings, Port Commission. Post & Telecommuni­cation and Salt Departments).

2. Item II (vii) (Government, n.i.e) includes imputed rents of Government buildings.

3. The net output of capital development in Government Sector [Item II (iii) (a)) is inclusive of:—

(a) the net output of Government capital works done on contract, and (b) ancillary services rendered in the process of capital development e.g., transport of capital goods imported by Government. (> 4. The net output of capital development* in the private sector and public corporations [item II (iif) (c)] comprises of:— (a) the net output of constructional industries, (Z>) the net output of industries producing constructional materials and other capital goods for domestic use, and

(c) the net output of planting and replanting. 5. Item II (iv) [Transport and Communication (Non-Government)] and item II (v) [Trade (Non-Government)] include the net output of public enterprises operating in these fields. These items also cover services rendered to the export sector. The Estimates of Trade and Transport have been revised to take account of the increase in transport charges and trade margins as determined on the basis of a random enquiry. General Notes :

1. Apart from published sources (such as the Ceylon Customs Returns) and special sources on certain specific items (e.g., the Department of Industries on industrial output) much of the primary data necessary for the preparation of this Table, as well as for the Table on the Gross National Expenditure, has been supplied by the Department of Census and Statistics.

2. On account of rounding of numbers in the Tables, component items may not add up exactly to the totals.

3. The percentage changes shown in the Tables have been computed on the basis of values in rupees million taken to one decimal place-

4. n.i.e. — not included elsewhere.

5. The estimates of product and expenditure for the years 1959 to 1962 published in the Central Bank Annual Report for 1962 have been revised. The estimates for 1963 are provisional.

TABLE II A-2

Gross National Product at Current Factor Cost Prices

( 24 )

Product and Expenditure in money terms

Table IIA-2 sets out the components of gross national product at current factor cost prices in the export sector and the domestic sector separately. In the export sector, the value of each of the principal export products fell in 1963. The value of tea exports fell by 0.8 per cent, the value of rubber exports by 11.5 per cent, and the value of coconut and coconut products by 9.8 per cent. Thus the value of total domestic exports, which had increased by 5.1 per cent in 1962, decreased by 3.5 per cent in 1963. However in 1963, estimates of the overall stock position in the export sector showed an improvement over the previous year. When this fact is taken into account, the net output of the export sector declined by only 1.5 per cent. As regards the production of export crops, tea production expanded by 3.9 per cent, as compared with an expansion of 2.6 per cent in 1962. The production of rubber increased by only 0.9 per cent, as compared with a rate of increase of 6.5 per cent in 1962. Coconut production is estimated to have declined by 10.2 per cent.

In the domestic sector, net output of agriculture, livestock and fisheries rose by 5.0 per cent, as compared to an increase of 2.9 per cent in 1962. The rise in 1963 was largely on account of a rise in the value of fish production by 24.4 per cent. Net output of industry (consumer goods) is estimated to have increased at about the same rate as in 1962, viz. by 19.1* per cent. Total cipital development, which had increased by 9.7 per cent in 1962, rose by 1.7 per cent. Capital develop­ment by the private sector and public Corporations taken together recorded a decline of 2.9 per cent, while capital development by the public enterprises recorded a substantial increase of 24.0 per cent. Net output of the service sector as a whole rose by 6.7 per cent, compared with a rise of 4.8 per cent in 1962. Trade, transport and communication and ownership of dwellings increased at rates higher than in the previous year. The net output of the domestic sector as a whole rose by 6.7 per cent as against a rise of 5.7 per cent in 1962.

In 1963, total gross domestic product in money terms increased by 4.9 per cent. This is higher than the rate of increase in any of the previous three years. Since net factor income from abroad fell in 1963, the increase in total gross national product, at 4.8 per cent, was slightly less than that of total gross domestic product.

It is noteworthy that the net output of the domestic sector i.e. production for domestic use as a ratio of gross domestic product shows a rising trend. This ratio, which stood at 75.1 per cent in 1959, increased to 77.4 per cent in 1962 and to 78.7 per cent in 1963.

*This estimate was made before the results of a survey of Industrial Produrtion discussed elsewhere in this Report became available. In the light of the results of this survey, it is possible that the rate of increase of industrial output as shown above may be somewhat overstated.

( 25 )

Details of locally produced goods at current producers' prices are shown in Table IIA-3.

It will be seen from Table IIA-3 that the producers' value of rice, which had increased by 10.4 per cent in 1962, increased by only 0.4 per cent in 1963. In 1963, output of paddy was affected by excessive rain in the paddy-growing areas. Paddy production increased in 1963 by only 1.1 million bushels as against an increase of 4.9 million bushels in 1962. The slight increase in the producers' value of rice thus reflects the modest increase in paddy production in 1963.

The producers' value of coconuts and coconut oil shows an increase of 17.2 per cent. This is largely because of the rise in the average producers' prices of these products. Estimates relating to fish indicate a substantial increase in output. In 1963, according to provisional data supplied by the Department of Fisheries, the producers' value of all varieties of fish increased by 24.4 per cent.

(c) The algebraic sum of items 11 and 12 of this table equals the gross national expenditure as shown at item VIII of Table II A-4. Item 14 of this table (expenditure on gross national product at market prices) diners from the algebraic sum of items 11 and 12, only by the amount shown as item 13 (unidentified changes in stocks and statistical discrepancy).

Table II A-4 presents direct estimates of gross national expenditure at current market prices. On the left hand side of Table IIA-5 gross national expenditure is estimated by adjusting gross national product at factor cost prices for net indirect taxes. It is seen from the Table II A-4 that total private consumption expenditure increased by 6.0 per cent, compared to an increase of 3.3 per cent in 1962. This increase in private consumption is largely on account of the higher outlay on locally produced goods, which rose by 11.5 per cent as against the rise of 5.9 per cent in 1962. Expenditure on-imported goods and services at market prices, however, fell by 2.0 per cent as against the rise of 1.3 per cent in 1962. Public consumption rose by 3.2 per, cent in 1963 as compared to an increase of 5.7 per cent in 1962. Total consum­ption, by both private and public sectors, increased by 5.5 per cent as against an increase of 3.7 per cent in the previous year.

Table II A-4 also gives estimates of total capital formation. Total capital forma­tion consists of fixed capital formation and changes in stocks. Gross domestic fixed capital formation, which had increased in 1961 and 1962 by 1.2 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, fell by 4.8 per cent in 1963. Estimates of stocks1 indicate a small increase in 1963. When account is taken of this rise in stocks, total capital formation shows a fall of 3.8 per cent in 1963.

Details of private consumption expenditure at current market prices are shown in Table II A-6. Total consumer expenditure on imported rice, flour and sugar, which had been increasing since 1961, fell in 1963 by 2.6 per cent. Expenditure on imports of other consumption goods fell by 2.2 per cent. The fall in expenditure on consump­tion goods, other than rice, flour and sugar, is attributable to the import restrictions imposed in 1962 and 1963. Expenditureon total imports, including non-factor services, decreased by 2.0 per cent in 1963.

Despite the fall in private consumption expenditure on imports, total private consumption expenditure increased mainly because expenditure on locally produced goods at market prices increased by 11.5 per cent. Expenditure on coconut increased by 20.3 per cent, reflecting increases in the retail prices of coconuts and coconut oil. Expenditure on fish also rose by 24.5 per cent.

The composition of capital formation in the private sector and public Corpora­tions is shown in Table IIA-7. It will be seen that the fall in fixed capital formation in the private sector and Corporations, relates principally to a decrease in investment in transport equipment and in building and other construction. Estimates of fixed capital formation are determined largely on the basis of imports of capital goods. In 1963, imports of building materials and transport equipment fell largely on account of the import restrictions imposed in 1962 and 1963. Consequent to the fall in imports of these goods capital formation in building and construction and in transport declined by 23.5 per cent and 31.7 per cent respectively. Capital formation in plant and machinery, however, recorded an increase of 36.0 per cent.

Table IIA-7 also presents data on fixed capital formation in the Government sector and changes in stocks in both the Government and private sectors. In 1963 total fixed capital formation in Government including public enterprises rose by 5.6 per cent, compared to a rise of 6.6 per cent in 1962. In the public enterprises fixed capital formation rose by 22.8 per cent as against a rise of 13.1 per cent in the previous year. In the rest of the Government sector i.e. excluding public enterprises, however fixed capital formation, which had increased by 4.2 per cent in 1962, fell by 1.2 per cent in 1963.

( 29 )

In 1963, as shown in the above Table (identifiable) stocks in the Government sector increased by Rs. 0.1 million on account of a fall in the stocks of imported rice, flour and sugar by Rs. 9.5 milhon and a rise in stocks of GPS paddy by Rs. 9. 6* milhon. Stocks in the private sector, mainly export stocks, however, increased by Rs. 12.0 miUion. Total stocks of both private and Government sectors rose by Rs. 12.1 million.

(o) This is Item III of Table IIA-2 adjusted for indirect taxes net of subsidies atem 2 of Table IIA-5) and for unidentified. changes in stocks plus statistical discrepancy (Item 13 of Table II A-5) to conform to the estimates of consumption and capital formation on the expenditure approach.

In the following pages it is proposed to analyse the data already given to high­light certain particular aspects of national product and expenditure.

Table IIA-8 shows the aggregate of resources available to the economy and the manner in which these resources were used. The resources available to a country consist of the goods and services produced plus goods imported from other countries. The relative importance of the latter varies from country to country depending on the degree of self sufficiency. In the case of Ceylon, the ratio of imports to total resources is of the order of 25 per cent.

It will be seen from Table IIA-8 that total resources increased in 1963 by 2.6 per cent. Although imports, in fact, fell by 2.7 per cent in 1963, resources through production increased by 4.2 per cent. In regard to the use of resources, consumption expenditure increased by 5.5 per cent, while domestic capital formation and exports declined by 3.8 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively.

•For the sake of consistency with other items of this Table, which are taken fr om the Table on the gross national expenditure (Table II A-4), the figures for gross national product at current market prices shown as item 3 of Table II A-5 have been adjusted by item 13 of that Table.

Table II A-9 shows the components of gross domestic expenditure and how they have been financed. The data in this Table indicate the extent to which it has been possible to finance total gross domestic expenditure by resources currently produced, i.e. the gross national product. It will be seen from this table that, in every year since 1959, gross national product at market prices fell short of gross domestic expenditure, and that these shortfalls were met almost entirely by disinvestment abroad.

In 1962 and 1963, gross domestic expenditure exceeded gross national product at market prices by 2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively. In 1962 the excess was met by net disinvestment abroad amounting to Rs. 144 million and from net receipts of international gifts and transfers of Rs. 7 million. In 1963, there was a net disinvestment of Rs. 146 million and a net receipt of international gifts and transfers of Rs. 5 million. Turning to the distribution of expenditure as between consumption and capital formation, it will be seen from this Table that, whereas in 1962, an amount equivalent to 87.1 per cent of gross national product went to consumption and 15.0 per cent to capital formation, in 1963, an amount equivalent to 88.2 per cent of gross national product went to consumption and 13.9 per cent to capital formation.

Table IIA-10 shows, at both c.i.f. and market values, the import content of public consumption:, private consumption, and total fixed capital formation. It will be seen that the import content of each of these categories of expenditure, whether at c.i.f. or market value, has generally fallen from 1959 to 1963. Thus the import content of private consumption expenditure, at c.i.f. value, which was 30.5 per cent in 1959, fell to 22.0 per cent in 1962 and declined further to 18.6 per cent in 1963. At market prices, it fell from 42.6 per cent in 1959 to 37.5 per cent in 1962, and to 34.7 per cent in 1963. Similarly, in the case of fixed capital formation, the import content, at c.i.f. values fell from 34.1 per cent in 1959 to 30.1 per cent in 1962, and to 29.7 per cent in 1963. At market value, it fell from 52.9 per cent in 1959 to 46.4 per cent in 1962, but rose slightly to 46.7 per cent in 1963.

Gross Domestic Product by Industrial Origin

Figures of gross domestic product presented earlier are re-arranged in Table IIA-11 to indicate the industrial structure of the economy. The basic industrial pattern of the economy in 1963 is very much the same as in previous years, except that between 1962 and 1963 share of construction (including constructional materials) has fallen slightly from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. The share of the agricultural sector which, fell from 47 per cent in 1960 to 46 per cent in 1961 and 45 per cent in 1962 declined further to 44 per cent in 1963.

Table IIA-11 also shows that the value of output in 1963 increased at high rates in manufacturing, in wholesale and retail trade, ownership of dwellings, and in banking, insurance and finance.

Real Product, Real Income and Real Expenditure

Table IIA-12 shows provisional estimates of gross national product at constant 1959 prices. In 1963, for the first time since 1960, there has been a fall in the real value of exports by 3.9 per cent. However, taking into account the rise in the value of stocks, the fall in the net output of the export sector at constant prices is 1.9 per cent.

In the domestic sector, paddy, tea and coconuts expanded by only 2.2 per cent as against 7.8 per cent in the previous year. In regard to Government, the increase in the real product, at 1.3 per cent, was lower than in 1962. In the case of the rest of the domestic sector, however, the increase was 3.8 per cent as against 3.3 per cent in 1962.

Total gross national product in real terms increased by 1.8 per cent compared to an increase of 3.7 per cent in 1962. The rate of increase in the real product in 1963 is lower than the rate of population growth which, according to provisional estimates, was 2. 6* per cent for 1963. The per capita real product, therefore, declined from Rs. 622 in 1962 to Rs. 617 in 1963. The rate of decline in the per capita real product in 1963 was 0.8 per cent, as against a rate of increase of 1.0 per cent in 1962.

Table II A-13 presents estimates of real national income and expenditure. Estimates of real national income are derived by adjusting estimates of real product for the terms of trade effect. Despite the increase in the real product by 1.8 per cent, real national income in 1963 was lower than in 1962 by 0.7 per cent. This was the result of an adverse movement in the terms of trade, which reduced the exchange value of the goods exported. The years 1960 and 1961 have also been marked by adverse movements in the terms of trade. It will be seen from Table II A-13 that in each of these years too, the rate of increase in the real national income was lower than that of the real product.

The production of the principal agricultural crops, except coconut, increased in 1963. Production of tea shows a higher rate of increase than in 1962. The production of rubber and paddy also increased, but the rate of increase in each case was much less than in the previous year. Coconut production, however, declined in 1963 as compared with 1962. The fall in the production of coconut and the relatively un­favourable expansion in rubber and paddy were largely the result of adverse weather conditions in 1963.

In 1963, the f.o.b. value of each of the principal export products at current prices fell. The quantity exported increased during 1963 in the case of tea, but fell in the case of rubber and coconut. The f.o.b. value of other export crops increased but the value of total exports, which had increased by 5.1 per cent in 1962, fell by 3.5 per cent in 1963.

At 1959 constant prices, tea exports increased by 0.9 per cent, as against a rise of 6?1 per cent in 1962. Rubber and coconut, which rose by 13.5 per cent and 8.4 per cent respectively in 1962, fell by 5.9 per cent and 18.2 per cent respectively in 1963.

Tea

Tea production in 1963 is estimated at 485 million pounds, and increase of 18 milhon pounds or 3.9 per cent as compared with 1962. This is an improvement over the previous year when the rate of increase was only 2.6 per cent. The quantity of tea exported increased by 4.2 million pounds. Since the average f.o.b. price per pound fell by 4 cents, the total value of tea exports fell by Rs. 8.3 million.

The increase in tea production partly reflects the higher yield per acre in 1963, viz. 792 pounds as against 790 pounds in 1962. This, as in the previous years, has been due mainly to the increased use of fertilizers.

The area replanted in 1963 was 2,293 acres, as compared to 1,770 acres replanted in 1962. This is probably due in large measure to the increased subsidy of Rs. 3,750/-* per acre given since 1963, as compared to a subsidy of Rs. 2,500/- given previously. The total area replanted at the end of 1963 was 6,491 acres.

Rs. 3,250/- per acre for land which need not be reconditioned.

Rubber

Compared to tea, rubber production was unsatisfactory. Total production of rubber increased by only 2 million pounds or 0.9 per cent, as against an increase of 14 million pounds or 6.5 per cent in 1962. Average yield per acre rose from 434 pounds in 1962 to 440 pounds in 1963. This relatively poor performance in rubber production is the result of excessive rain in the rubber growing areas in many months of the year.

The quantity of rubber exported decreased by 15.0 million pounds in 1963, while the average f.o.b. price fell by 6 cents per pound. Consequently, the value of rubber exports fell by Rs-. 33.4 million. This is in contrast to the rise in the value of exports in 1962 by Rs. 30.2 million.

Total acreage replanted under the Replanting Subsidy Scheme rose from 187,686 acres at the end of 1962 to 203,598 acres at the end of 1963, representing an increase of 8.5 per cent compared to an increase of 10.6 per cent in 1962.

Coconut

Estimates of coconut production, based on the nut equivalent of internal con­sumption and exports, show a decline from 2,811 millionnuts in 1962 to 2,523 million nuts in 1963. This is a fall of 10.2 per cent as compared with the rise of 8.1 per cent in 1962 as against 1961. Coconut production too was affected by adverse weather conditions despite increased use of fertilizers.

Coconut exports (nut equivalent) declined from 1,537 million nuts in 1962 to 1,216 million in 1963, a decrease of 21 per cent. Although the f.o.b. prices of copra, coconut oil and desiccated coconut increased, the value of exports fell by Rs. 26.9 million. The fall in the total value of exports of coconuts and coconut products in 1963 was 9.8 per cent as compared with the increase of 10.6 cent in 1962.

Paddy

Paddy production also suffered in 1963 owing to adverse weather conditions. The increase in production in 1963, according to provisional estimates, was only 1.1 million bushels or 2.3 per cent as compared with an increase of 4.9 million bushels or 11.3 per cent in 1962. Maha production in 1963 was 31.6 million bushels as against 30.3 million bushels in the previous Maha season but average yield per acre fell from 38.0 bushels to 37.8 bushels. The 1963 Yala crop recorded 17.6 million bushels as compared to 17.8 million bushels in the previous Yala season. The average yield per acre rose from 37.7 bushels in 1962 to 38.0 bushels in 1963.

The quantity of paddy purchased under the Guaranteed Price Scheme, increased from 25.3 million bushels in 1962 to 27.8 million bushels in 1963. Paddy production in terms of rice rose from 653,653 tons (revised figures) in 1962 to 668,407 tons in 1963. Imports of rice rose from 490,210 tons in 1962 to 508,230 tons in 1963. Total consumption of rice is estimated to have increased from 1,103,300 tons in 1962 to 1,145,100 tons in 1963.
