    "text": "Revenue from export taxes( 1 ) in 1964/65 was higher by Rs. 35.4 million when compared with that in 1963/64. This was the combined result of an increase in revenue receipts from taxes on tea of Rs 10.8 million, and increased duty collections on rubber and coconut products of Rs 10.6 million and Rs 14.5 million respecti\u00advely. The increased revenue from tea exports occurred although there was a fall of 2 cts. per lb. in the average f.o.b. price during the financial year to Rs 2.47 per lb. This increase in revenue was due to an increase in tea exports of 5.7 million lbs. in 1964/65/\" Similarly, the increase in the export duty collections on rubber was the result of an increase of 20.8 million lbs. in the quantity of rubber exported, offset by a decline in the average f.o.b. price( 3 ) of 2 cts per lb. during the financial year to Rs. 1.14 per lb. On the other hand, the increase in the export duty receipts from coconut products was on account of an improvement in prices offset partially by a decline in export volume. Exports of copra which amounted to 59-3 thousand tons in 1963/64 fell to 44-9 thousand tons in 1964/65, while desiccated coconuts and coconut oil exports decreased from 55-1 thousand tons and 104-5 thousand tons respectively in 1963/64 to 51-5 thousand tons and 103-8 thousand tons respectively in 1964/65. The effect of these decreases in export volume, however, was more than offset by higher effective rates of duty conseq\u00aduent on a more favourable price than in 1963/64.( 4 ) The average price (f. o. b.) for all three types of coconut products increased from Rs. 59-07 to Rs. 72-58 per cwt.",

The fall in the revenue from cotton yarn etc. (Rs. 18-0 Million), grain and flour (Rs. 9-5 million), sugar (Rs. 10-5 million) and \"other goods\" (Rs. 47-5 million) amounted to Rs. 85-5 million. This shortfall was offset to some extent by the larger revenue from the duties on kerosene oil, motor spirits and liquid fuel (Rs. 27-1 million)( 6 ) and tobacco and cigarettes (Rs. 2-7 million); The decreased collections under cotton yarn etc. grain and flour, and sugar were due to a decreased volume of imports and a delay in the payment of duties by the Food Commissioner in respect of the last two items. In particular, the import Volume index reveals that the volume of textile imports during 1964/65 was almost half that of the previous financial year. By the same token, the increase in the duty collections from fuel and tobacco was due to an increase in import volume. The large fall in duty collections under the item \"other goods\" is accounted for by the sharp reduction in the quantity of imports under this category.",

    "text": "The higher subsidy on the consumption of imported rice was partly due to the higher landed cost of rice from Burma, China and Thailand. There was also a rise in the sale of imported rice in 1964/65 over 1963/64 by 95,420 tons. The lower subsidy on the production and consumption of locally produced rice may be accounted for by a fall in the quantity of rice bought from the Commissioner of Agrarian Services and subsequently sold to the consumer. Sales of locally produced rice were less in 1964/65 than in 1963/64 by 66,787 tons. In consequence the gross subsidy in 1964/65 exceeded that of 1963/64 by only Rs. 9-4 million. The fall in the net subsidy in 1964/65 is therefore accounted for by the marked rise in profits on the sale of sugar. The larger profits on the sale of sugar was made possible by the fall in the landed cost of sugar in 1964/65 as compared to the extra ordinarily high level of prices in 1963/64, while the sale price to the consumer remained constant over the two years.",

The expansionary impact of Government fiscal operations in 1964/65 at Rs. 40-0 million has recorded a fall by as much as Rs. 122-9 million over the corresponding figure for 1963/64. This was achieved almost wholly by the increased reliance on borrowing from domestic non-bank sources (Rs. 35-6 million) and from administrative sources (Rs. 58-6 million), which enabled the Government to reduce its borrowing from the banking system by Rs. 97-5 million, and the use of its cash balances by Rs. 20-6 million.",

The surtax which is intended to take the place of an expenditure tax will be 20 per cent, and 35 per cent, so that the highest marginal rate of tax payable becomes 80 per cent.( 3 )",
