In the 1964/65 Budget it was expected that the inflationary gap will be altogether eliminated. In actual performance, however, this did not materialise and there was a reduced inflationary gap of Rs. 40-0 million; even this reduction was made possible by certain fortuitous circumstances rather than by the close implementation of the Budget measures.",

The average landed cost per long ton fell to Rs. 601 in 1964/65 and consequently Government's profits on the import and sale of sugar alone increased by almost Rs. 100 million. It is clear that but for this favourable and sharp movement in sugar prices, current expenditure would have followed the usual trend and recorded an increase above the 1963/64 level because there were increases in the other major expenditure categories such as Health, Education and Government enterprises.",

The net cash deficit after adjusting for Sinking Fund contributions and operations on advance accounts was Rs. 442-5 million, as compared withRs. 461-7 million in 1963/64 and Rs. 391-7 million in 1962/63. Table I - 1 shows the financing of the deficit in 1964/65 and previous years. While in 1964/65 the net cash deficit itself was lower than in 1963/64 by Rs. 17-8 million, there were significant differences in the manner of financing the cash deficit. Reliance on the banking system and other inflationary sources of financing was minimised, and at Rs. 40-0 million the inflationary gap was the lowest in recent years. The downward trend in the net expansionary impact of the Budget from its peak level in 1958/59 was commented on in previous Reports. In 1963/64 the expansionary impact was contained at the 1962/63 level despite a sharp increase in the net cash deficit. The performance in 1964/65 in this respect marked a distinct departure from the past, and merits closer examination.",

This fall in reserves in the first quarter was made good towards the end of the second quarter and short-term liabilities were also reduced. The improved position in the second quarter of 1965 was made possible only by purchasing foreign exchange valued at Rs. 38-2 million from the International Monetary Fund and the reduction of import payments through import restrictions.",
