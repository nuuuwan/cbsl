In 1965, monetary expansion was less than in the two previous years. Gross bank credit to the private sector1 increased only by Rs. 4-2 million in contrast to increases of Rs. 62-8 million in 19642 and Rs. 136.9 million in 1963. Commercial bank credit to Government increased by Rs. 92>3 million, while Central Bank credit to Government declined by Rs. 10-7 million. This is in sharp contrast to 1964 when the increase in commercial bank credit to Govern­ment was only Rs. 3-6 million while Central Bank credit to Government increased by as much as Rs. 130 million. The overall increase in credit extended by the banking system to the Government in 1965 was Rs. 81-6 million, which was substantially less than the increase of Rs. 133-6 million in 1964. Net foreign assets owned by the banking system, including transfers to the Central Bank of Government-owned foreign assets, increased by Rs. 79-7 million; but excluding such transfers the increase - for the first time since 1956 - amounted to Rs. 49.6 million.

The pattern of monetary expansion in 1965 shows three distinct differences from the pattern of 1963 and 1964. Whereas in those two previous years mone­tary expansion took place in spite of substantial declines in the foreign assets of the banking system, in 1965 the expansion was due in some measure to an increase in the net external assets held by the banking system. Secondly, while monetary expansion in 1963 and 1964 was caused substantially by commercial bank credit expansion to the private sector, in 1965 this factor had only a very minor effect. Thirdly, while in 1963 and 1964 Central Bank credit to Govern­ment was a major expansionary factor, in 1965, the effect of this factor ; was contractionary. In sum, the somewhat mild monetary expansion in 1965 was accounted for by increases in external banking assets and commercial bank credit to the private sector and an increase in commercial bank credit to trie Government sector, compensated to some extent by a decline in Central Bank credit to the Government.3

Liquidity in the non-bank private sector

Total liquid assets of the non-bank private sector amounted to Rs. 3,466-5 million as at the end of December 1965, showing an increase of Rs. 243-2 million or 7-5 per cent. In 1964, the corresponding increase was

1 Private sector is here defined to include Government Corporations, local authorities Co-operative and various semi-Government or Government-sponsoied institutions "and, agencies-in fact all entities other than the Central Government, the commercial banks and the Central Bank.

2 The increase in bank credit (including export bills) to the private sector was given at Rs. 92.0 million in the Annual Report for 1964. This figure has now been revised because the figure of Government import bills purchased as at the end of December 1964, had been incorrectly reported under credit to the private sector.

3 As from 28th May 1965, the Central Bank raised the Bank rate from 4 to 5 per cent. Lending rafts of all commercial banks were immediately adjusted upwards in sympathy with the rise in Bank Rate. With effect from 15th June, the Central Bank also introduced a system, of credit rationing intended to limit the total increase in bank credit to a rate more in keeping with the increase in the real national product.

Rs. 273-9 million or 9-3 percent. Primary liquid assets increased by Rs. 93-8

million in 1965, as against an increase of Rs. 1158 million in 1964- Secondary

liquid assets increased byRs. 149-3 million as against an increase of Rs. 158-1

million in the previous year. Consequently the ratio of primary liquid

assets to total liquid assets declined slightly from 50-3 per cent in 1964 to 49-5

per cent in 1965.

Table II (C) 1 below shows that currency held by the public amounted to

Rs. 901-4 million, at the end of 1965, reflecting an increase of Rs 48-4 million or

5-7 per cent as against an increase of Rs. 24-6 million or 3 0 per cent in 1964-

On the other hand, the increase in demand deposits held by the public by Rs.

45.5 million or 5.9 per cent to Rs 814.3 million was significantly lower than in 1964

when the corresponding increase was Rs. 914 million or 13-4 percent. From Table II

(C) 3 in Section 1 (a) below on the money supply it is observed, however, that there

was hardly any change in the ratio of demand deposits to money supply, which was

47-5 per cent in 1965, as compared with 47.4 per cent in 1964. Deposits with the

Ceylon Savings Bank and the Post Office Savings Bank together with time and

savings deposits of commercial banks increased by Rs. 65-5 million (6-5 per cent) to

Rs. 1,069-9 million at the end of December 1965. In 1964 the increase

In the volume of deposits of these institutions amounted to Rs 83-7 million or 9-1

per cent. Savings certificates and Treasury bills held by the public increased by

Rs. 4*4 million and Rs. 4-3 million respectively. Government bonds totalling

Rs. 586-7 million constituted the largest single type of secondary liquid asset held

by the non-bank private sector and recorded an increase of Rs. 81-0 million or

160 per cent as against an increase of Rs. 59-1 million or 13-2 per cent in 1964-

Government bonds accounted for 33-3 per cent of the increase in aggregate

liquid assets held by the private sector in 1965. Of this Increase, Rs.

42 million was accounted for by the Insurance Corporation while trusts,

benevolent, pension and provident funds (excluding the Employees' Provident

Fund) accounted for a large part of the balance. Holdings of tax reserve

certificates contracted by Rs. 5-4 million or 13-0 per cent during the year.

From the foregoing analysis it is observed that demand deposits held by the

public did not increase greatly in 1965 and that there was no marked change in

the preference of the public as between primary and secondary liquid assets. The

growth in secondary liquid assets too did not reflect any marked change in public

preference for different types of secondary liquid assets as compared with 1964.

Table II (C) 2 above gives the figures of private sector deposits by owner­

ship categories on the basis of the survey data collected by the Central Bank-

As in the preceding year, in 1965 too the largest increase in deposits amounting

to Rs. 60-6 million was by "individuals". Deposits of plantations increased by

Rs. 12-9 million as compared with a contraction of Rs. 15-7 million in 1964-

This was probably due to the moratorium on the remittance of dividends imposed

in July 1964 which, though relaxed somewhat in August 1965, was operative

throughout 1965. The deposits of trading institutions showed a moderate increase i

of Rs. 8-7 million compared with an increase of Rs. 19-3 million in 1964. The

increase in deposits of the category 'other business' by Rs. 20-7 million was larger

than in the previous year. Deposits of local authorities and non-business lnsti- ( tutions however, showed a substantial contraction.

1. (a) Money Supply

The money supply as at the end of December 1965 was Rs. 1,715.7 million

showing an increase of Rs. 93-8 million or 5-8 per cent for the year. In 1964 the

corresponding increase was Rs. 115-8 million or 7-7 per cent and in 1963 Rs.163-3

million or 12-2 percent. The smaller increase in the money supply in 1965 as

compared with 1964 and 1963 was reflected in the ratio of the increase in money

supply to the increase in total liquid assets of the non-bank ptivate sector which

was 55 per cent in 1963, 42 per cent in 1964 and 38-5 per cent in 1965. The

ratio in 1965 may be compared to the ratio of 37 per cent in 1962, in which year

the money supply rose by 4.2 per cent, a moderate increase as compared with

1963 and 1964

In the Annual Report for 1964, attention was drawn to the reversal in the tendency of the public to hold an increasing proportion of the money supply in currency rather than in demand deposits. Attention was also drawn to the signi­ficant change in the composition of currency held between June and December 1964. Table II ( C ) 3 above shows that in 1965, the ratio of currency to total money supply at 52-5 per cent remained almost the same as in .1964- But the composition of currency held underwent a marked change during the course of 1965. Frbm Table II (C) 4 below, it may be noted that between end May and end December 196 notes of Rs. 100 denomination declined sharply by Rs. 130 million whereas notes of Rs. 50 and Rs. 10 denominations increased by Rs. 12 million and Rs. 102 million respectively. In contrast, in the year 1965, wrule total currency liabilities of the Central Bank increased by Rs. 70-7 million, the circulation of notes of the denominations of Rs. 5 and Rs- 10 contracted by Rs. 44-8 million, whereas notes of the denominations Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 increased by Rs. 71-5 million and Rs. 39-5 million respectively. The change from notes of higher denominations to lower denominations experienced in 1964 seems to have been largely reversed in 1965. This seems to confirm the

observation made in the Annual Report for 1964, that "these changes might have been a reflection of expectations regarding measures directed against tax evasion and the hoarding of undeclared assets in the form of currency notes of the higher denominations". This observation cannot, however, be con­firmed with certainty because it is possible that a substantial proportion of currency notes of the larger denominations were held to facilitate transactions contracted In cash to avoid liability to the debits tax. It is of interest to note that the opera­tion of the Bank debits tax introduced in 1957, coincided with a period of steady fall in the ratio of demand deposits to total money supply. The Bank debits tax was withdrawn with effect from 1st October 1965, but it is yet too early to examine the effect of the withdrawal of the debits tax on the composition of the money supply.

Table II (C) 5 sets out on a sectoral basis factors affecting the money supply during the period 1960/65. This sectoral classification identifies the changes originating from the operations of the Government sector and the private sector with the banking system and also from changes in the net external assets held by the banking system. Significant differences are observed in the sectoral origin of changes in the money supply in 1965. The principal cause of monetary expansion in the 5 years prior to 1965 had been the continued increase in the borrowings of the government from the banking system; mostly from the Central Bank and to a lesser degree from commercial banks. In 1963 and 1964 large increases in bank credit to the private sector added to the monetary expansion- This expansion was moderated by the continued increase in time and savings deposits with the banking system, with the exception of the year 1961, and by the depletion of foreign assets held by the banking system.

In 1965 the operations of the government sector continued to be expansi­onary though to a smaller degree than in the previous year. Central Bank credit to the government however, recorded a decline. Central Bank holdings of government and government guaranteed securities contracted by Rs 38-7 million as against an increase of Rs 123-2 million in 1964; but provisional advances of the Central Bank to the Government increased by Rs 28 million, limiting the decline in the volume of total Central Bank credit to the Govern­ment in 1965 to Rs 10-7 million. On the other hand, commercial bank credit made available to the Government increased by Rs 92-3 million as against an increase of Rs 3-6 million in 1964. This large increase in 1965 is sccounted for mainly by the increase in government import bills held amounting to Rs 59-5 million as against an increase of Rs 3-3 million in 1964. Commercial bank credit to the private sector (excluding export bills) increased by only Rs 11-0 million as compared with an increase of Rs 82-6 million in 1964. In 1965" time and savings deposits increased substantially as in the previous year but net external banking assets had for the first time since 1956, an expansionary impact of Rs 79-7 million which figure, however, includes the purchase value of Rs. 30-1 million of foreign securities acquired by the Central Bank from Government institutions. Total monetary expansion for the year at Rs 93-8 million was the lowest since 1962. The main development which contained" monetary

expansion in 1965 was the relatively small increase in commercial bank credit to the private sector.

In the first quarter of 1965, the money supply contracted markedly by Rs 36-9 million but in each of the subsequent quarters the money supply expanded though irregularly. The money supply was at its lowest for the year in February when it reached a figure of Rs 1,581-9 million, reflecting a decline of Rs 39-9 million below the level at December 1964. From Table II (C) 7 it is observed that the source of monetary contraction in the first quarter of the year * was largely the fall in external banking assets and a reduction in the net government debt held by the banking system. On the other hand, in the second and third quarters of the year, external banking assets recorded substantial increases while the operations of the government with the banking system were also expan­sionary. Gross bank credit to the private sector contracted substantially ini the third quarter of the year while the increase in time and savings deposits contri­buted significantly to the contractionary factors. This was reflected in the money supply which reached a mid-year peak in July of Rs 1,692-7 million and declined in the last two months of the 3rd quarter. The money supply increased in October but declined in November and increased again in December. The fourth quarter taken as a whole showed a large increase in the money supply, accounted for mainly by the increase in the net government debt held by the banking system and the increase in commercial bank credit to the private sector. External banking assets, however, declined markedly and together with the substantial increase in time and savings deposits moderated the impact of the expansionary factors.

The increase in aggregate non-bank private sector deposits1 in 1965 was not as large as in 1964. The average monthly turnover rate of these deposits, which had risen in 1964, showed a slight decline in 1965.

1 Consists of savings deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank, Ceylon Savings Bank and time and savings deposits with the commercial banks.

( 66 )

Demand deposits held by the public with the commercial banks increased by Rs 38-1 million or 5-0 per cent as against an increase, of Rs 91-3 million or 1,3-5 per cent in 1964. But in 1965 the turnover rate of demand deposits declined by 1-6 per cent from 1-82 in 1964 to 1-79 in 1965. The increase in time and savings deposits of the public with commercial banks on the other hand was greater than in 1964; but the average monthly turnover rate of time deposits increased infinitesimally to 0-24 while the rate on savings deposits declined very slightly to 0-08.

The change in turnover rates of deposits with the Ceylon Savings Bank and the Post Office Savings Bank was negligible..

The decline in turnover rates of non-bank private sector deposits as a whole was slight. It does not seem unreasonable to infer from this and the absence of any marked change in the public's preference for the different categories of liquid assets that expectations of the public with regard to prices have not changed significantly over the year.

1. (c) Time and Savings Deposits

An important feature of the increase in domestic liquidity in the recent past was the steady growth of time and savings deposits with the commercial banks, the Post Office Savings Bank and the Ceylon Savings Bank. The increase of Rs 65-5 millon or 6.5 per cent in the time and savings deposits of these institutions which totalled Rs 1,069-9 million in 1965, was somewhat lower than the increase of Rs. 83-7 million or 9-1 per cent recorded in 1964.

Time and savings deposits with the commercial banks increased by Rs 46-9 million and accounted for 71-6 per cent of the total increase in time and savings deposits. Post Office Savings Bank's deposits increased by Rs 16 million, and balances with the Ceylon Savings Bank by Rs 2-6 million. The rates of expan­sion in deposits were lower than in the previous year in the case of all three institutions.

Total time and savings deposits with the commercial banks recorded larger in­creases in the last four years. Out of the total private sector time deposits with commercial banks 63 per cent was held by the business sector1, and 23 per cent by individuals. Ninety one per cent of the savings deposits with commercial banks was owned by individuals. 1. (d) Government Bonds

The Table II (C) 9 below gives the figures of total Government bonds held and the increase in Government bonds in 1964 and 1965 in terms of ownership categories. The Employees' Provident Fund took the largest, share of the increase in Government bonds in 1965, as in 1964, but semi-Government savings institutions continued to be the largest holder of Government bonds. Though the commercial banks were the second largest group holding Govern­ment bonds, the increase in their holdings in 1965 was only Rs.2.4 million. Trusts, benevolent, pension and provident fund investments in Government bonds increased by Rs 32.5 million. The Ceylon Insurance Corporation held Rs 97.0 million in Government bonds as at the end of 1965, reflecting an increase of Rs. 42.0 million over the year. Private insurance companies had Rs. 133.9 million invested in Government securities, but the increase amounted to only Rs. 4.7 million for the year. Sinking funds of the Government and other Government funds accounted for 20-4 per cent of the total of Government bonds held in 1965 and 26-1 per cent of the increase for the year. The Employees' Provident Fund, the Insurance Corporation and semi- Government savings institutions accounted for 42-9 per cent of the total Government bonds held in 1965 and for 58 per cent of the increase for the year. The overwhelming predominance of these institutions in the market tor Government bonds has a great bearing on both the level and structure of rates of interest on Government bonds of varyine maturities. Government bonds held by individuals showed an increase of Rs. 3-9 million or 21-2 per cent in 1965. Since the total volume of Government bonds held by individuals is about one per cent of the total outstanding, this increase is without market significance. Yet it is an indication of the revival in the confidence of the private investor.

1. (e) Interest Rates

The Central Bank raised its lending rate to commercial banks (Bank Rate)

from 4 per cent to 5 per cent with effect from 28th May, 1965. In June all

lending rates of commercial banks moved up in sympathy. The minimum

rates charged for loans secured by. shares of joint stock companies, stock in

trade, and immovable property were raised to 7 per cent. The minimum rate

charged in respect of unsecured loans was raised by as much as 2 per cent to 7 per

cent. Except for the minimum rate of 5$ per cent against Government securities and

5 per cent rate against the residual category of other loans, a minimum rate of

7 per cent was in operation for all types of other bank loans. Maximum rates

charged for loans against shares of joint stock companies, stock in trade and the

category of other loans were raised as high as 9 per cent. On representations

made by exporters, the Central Bank used its powers of moral suasion to Induce

commercial banks to reduce their rates on advances secured by export stocks.

The discount rate on commercial bills alone remained unaffected by the

rise in the bank rate.

As a sequel to the increased cost of borrowing at the Central Bank, the commercial banks raised their call money rate by 0-25 per cent to 3 per cent.

In November the People's Bank raised its savings deposit rate to 3 per cent and its fixed deposit rate for amounts up to Rs. 25,000 to 3 J per cent. Rates for amounts over Rs. 25,000 were also raised.

On 31. 5. 65 the State Mortgage Bank raised its maximum rate for develop­ment loans to 7-0 per cent and non-development loans to 8-0 per cent. The Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation too adjusted its lending rates by raising its minimum rate to 6>5 per cent on 1. 8. 65.

The deposit rates of the Post Office Savings Bank and Ceylon Savings Bank remained unchanged over the year.

Since 1962 the tender rate in respect of Treasury bills has been stable at 2-80 per cent. From July 1965 onwards, there has been a noticeable upward movement in the Treasury bill rate and in the last three months of the year, the weighted average rate for monthly issues was 3 per cent- The rate paid to the Central Bank in respect of its purchases of Treasury bills was raised from 0-76 per cent to 1-0 per cent with effect from August, 1965.

The rate in respect of Government loans with a maturity of over 20 years remained unchanged at 4$ per cent and was below the Bank rate of 5 per cent from 28th May 1965 onwards. Traditionally, the former rate has been above Bank Rate in the past. It is unlikely, however, that the volume of funds forthcoming for investment in Government bonds would decline in the near future as a consequence.

2. Commercial Banking

The increase in gross bank credit to the private sector by Rs 4-2 million as at the end of 1965 was the lowest on record for the past four years. The ratio

of liquid assets to demand deposits increased substantially from 55 per cent to

62-8 per cent. The two Ceylonese banks accounted for the expansion of credit whereas the activities of the foreign banks resulted in an overall contraction of credit. Ceylonese banks held 66 per cent of total bank deposits in 1965.

At the end of the year under review, a total of 97 bank offices were operating in Ceylon. The British, Indian and Pakistani banks accounted for 16 offices and the balance 81 were offices of the Ceylonese banks. Of the 97 bank offices, 69 were located outside Colombo. Peoples Bank had a total of 48 offices

of which eight were opened during the year under review. These new branch offices were located at Horana, Kekirawa, Padaviya, Mannar, Embilipitiya, Yatiyantota, Kilinochchi and at the Secretariat in Colombo. The Bank of Ceylon opened one new office which was located within the city of Colombo.

The Peoples Bank has made an effort to make available banking facilities to the rural farmer engaged in the cultivation of paddy and other non-export crops with its scheme of rural banks which was operated on a pilot scale. In 1964, eight1 co-operative societies had been chosen in association with the Co-operative Department to function as rural banks,2 but only three of them were actually established as rural banks in that year; by July 1965 all eight societies were functioning as rural banks.

1 Of the eight, seven were multi-purpose co operatives while one was a credit society 2 Rural banks were empowered to accept savings deposits from the public as well as from members. They also had access to credit facilities from the Peoples Bank to augment the resources available to the societies for lending to their members. The recovery of loans was supervised by the Peoples Bank.

margins against letters of credit. Paid up capital, undistributed profits"

and reserves of the banks increased by Rs. 9-1 million. Government deposits

with the commercial banks increased by Rs. 11-8 million as compared with art

increase of Rs. 2-9 million in 1964.

The increased resources of the banks were utilized partly to finance the

trading operations of the Government. Commercial bank investments in

Government paper increased by Rs. 32<8 million and their short term credit to

the government increased by Rs. 59-5 million.

Bank advances to the private sector absorbed only Rs. 4-2 million of the

increase in resources. Their miscellaneous assets classified as other assets increased

by Rs. 43.7 million. Indebtedness to the Central Bank was reduced by Rs. 12-8

million and an additional Rs. 18-7 million was used to improve their cash assets.

2. (b) Structure of Banking Liabilities

Table II (C) 12 is a summary of the distribution of commercial bank assets

and liabilities for the period 1954 - 1965.

Total assets/liabilities of commercial banks increased by Rs. 156.0 million or

9-4 per cent from Rs. 1,658-4 million to Rs. 1,814.4 million in 1965 as against an

increase of Rs. 130.0 million or 8.5 per cent in 1964. Increases of Rs. 98.3

million in total deposits, Rs. 54.7 million in their other liabilities and a contract

tion of Rs. 7-3 million in inter-bank borrowings broadly explains the overall

increase in total liabilities of commercial banks. The increase in total deposit

liabilities at 6-8 per cent was considerably lower than the increase of 11-2 per

cent in 1964- In 1964 the increase in demand deposits was greater than the

increase in time and savings deposits. In the year under review a reversal of

this relationship has been seen indicating a noticeable public preference for

interest bearing deposits.

The bulk of the increase in depor its were those of private sector consti­

tuents. Demand deposits of private sector constituents including Government

Corporations and Co-operative institutions increased by Rs. 38-1 million. Time

and sayings deposits of private sector constituents including Government Corpo­

rations and Co-operative institutions increased by Rs. 46-9 million. Government

demand deposits with the commercial banks increased by Rs. 3-1 million and

its time deposits by Rs. 8-7 million.

Table II (C) 13 is a classified summary of the principal ownership categories

of private sector deposits held by commercial banks, on the basis of half yearly

surveys regularly carried out by the Central Bank.

Source: Central Bank of Ceylon Bank deposits of all categories of holders, except local authorities and non­business institutions increased in 1965. At the end of the year financial institu­tions, plantations, trading and other business categories that could be classified as the business sector held 46 per cent of the total private sector bank deposits. Non-business institutions and individuals together accounted for 50-7 per cent and local authorities held 3-2 per cent of the total.

Individuals held the largest volume of deposits. Their demand deposits increased by Rs. 35.4 million and savings deposits by Rs 29.9 million. However, time deposits of individuals contracted by Rs, 4.8 million. Plantation deposits which had a tendency to decline during the past few years increased in 1965. Demand and time deposits of plantations increased by Rs. 9.8 million and Rs. 3.3 millon respectively, but their savings deposits declined fractionally by Rs. 0.1 million. Demand and savings deposits of trading accounts tended to contract, but time deposits in this category increased sizeably by Rs. 16.6 million. Demand deposits classified under other business accounts increased by Rs. 28 million but time deposits declined by Rs 8.1 million.

2. (d) Structure of Bank Assets

Table 1 1 ( C ) 12 above is a summary of the distribution of assets and liabilities of the commercial banks, with the significant categories of banks' assets, expressed as percentages of total deposits and/or demand deposits.

In 1965 the commercial banks maintained a high degree of liquidity. Over the December 1964/December 1965 period their total liquid assets incre­ased by Rs. 97 million from Rs. 493 million to Rs. 590 million. Cash on hand and deposits with the Central Bank increased by Rs. 19 million and the ratio of cash to demand deposits stood at 24.8 per cent. Foreign balan­ces of commercial banks declined by Rs. 9.0 million. Commercial bills purchased and discounted increased by Rs. 54 million and it constituted 12.0 per cent of the total deposit liabilities. Treasury bills held by commercial banks represented 8.2 per cent of their total deposits, and over the year it reflected an increase of Rs. 33.0 million. The ratio of total liquid assets to demand deposits at 62.8 per cent was the highest on record for the last ten years. The ratio of liquid assets to total deposits was 38-2 per cent, and the high degree of liquidity signified by these two ratios is only an indication of the under-utilised resources of the banking system in 1965.

Commercial bank investments in Government bonds remained stable at Rs. 329 million. Their loans and overdrafts increased by only Rs. 13 million in 1965 whereas in 1964 the increase was Rs. 106-8 million. The ratio of loans and overdrafts to total deposits declined from 45-1 per cent as at the end of December 1964 to 43-0 per cent as at end of December 1965.

2. (e) Commercial bank credit to the private sector

Commercial bank credit to the private sector increased in the first five months of the year except in the month of March. In the seven months from June, there were increases in the months of July, October, November and December. For the year as a whole gross bank credit to the private sector increased by Rs. 4-2 million.

Table II (C) 14 is a classification of bank credit to the private sector by type of advance.

The decline, in purchased cash items in process of collection in 1965 is accounted for by the decline in the outstanding advances granted for the purchase of paddy and other food crops under the Guaranteed Price Scheme consequent to the partial failure of the Yala crop. The speeding up of repayments of these advances by the Commissioner of Agrarian Services, consequent to representations made also contributed to this decline. Though import bills increased marginally by Rs; 1-1 million in 1965, the average monthly value of import bills in 1965 amounted to Rs. 45-2 million as against an average monthly value of Rs. 59-2 million in 1964. This was undoubtedly a reflection of the marked decline in the value of imports in 1965 as compared with 1964. Export bills declined by Rs. 6-5 million in 1965 though the value of exports increased substantially as compared with 1964 in which year too export bills had shown a decline of Rs. 19-2 million whereas the value of exports was markedly above the 1963 level. Loans and overdrafts increased by only Rs. 13 million as compared with an increase of Rs- 106-8 million in 1964.

*This category contains only a small element of inter-bank debt represented in cheques sent for collection. It consists mainly of very short-term advances granted to co-operatives for the finance of purchases of foodstuffs under the Guaranteed Price Scheme.

o

Within this increase in 1965, loans and overdrafts to the Government Corpora­tions increased by Rs. 7-8 million and co-operative institutions by Rs. 5-6 million.

Figures of bank advances classified according to purposes and maturity distribution are given in Table II (C) 15. In using this data, it is necessary to exercise more than the usual degree of caution because of difficulties in classif­ying advances granted to firms engaged in more than one trade, by purpose, e. g. firms engaged in both industry and commerce or commerce and agriculture. Besides, advances which are said to be for a certain purpose by the borrower may be used for quite a different purpose, particularly when credit restrictions are imposed.

The decline in total bank advances for commercial purposes by Rs. 13-7 million is the net result of contractions of Rs. 10-5 million in export credit, Rs. 20 million in import credit and increases of Rs. 8-7 million in credit for wholesale and retail trading and Rs. 8.1 million in the residual category of other commercial loans. Credit for industrial purposes increased by Rs. 1-7 million. Agricultural loans defined to include credit for the cultivation of tea, rubber, coconut, livestock and for dairy farming increased by Rs. 5-9 million. Credit for tea plantations increased by Rs. 2-3 million, and for rubber increased by Rs. 1-6 million. ' Consumer loans recorded an increase of Rs. 15-8 million and other loans increased by Rs. 1-0 million.

* Advances include loans, overdrafts and bills discounted and exclude cash items in process of collection.

Commercial bank advances are classified by type of securities in Table II

(C) 16. Advances secured by documentary bills, Government securities, shares

of joint stock companies stock in trade and immovable property declined in 1965.

Loans secured by documentary bills increased fractionally and those secured by

government securities declined by Rs. 5-0 million. Loans against stock in trade

declined by Rs. 7-8 million. Advances secured by time and savings deposits

and life policies increased significantly by 16-9 million as compared with a mild

increase of Rs 3-1 million in 1964. Loans secured by other types of securities

increased by Rs 6-7 million and unsecured loans increased by Rs 8-5 million.

Table II ( C ) 17 gives a classification of bank advances by rate of interest.

In May 1965 the Bank Rate was raised from 4 to. 5 per cent and all lending

rates of commercial banks moved up in sympathy. Consequent to the increase

in the Bank Rate the advances granted at rates between 4^-6 percent declined

appreciably during the second half of the year. In December 1964, 5-4 per cent

of the total bank advances were at 4$ per cent but by December 1965 it thad

declined to 1-2 per cent of the total advances. The category of advances

bearing a 6 per cent rate which amounted to Rs. 299-2 million or 42-6

per cent of total advances in December 1964, declined to Rs- 6 - 2 million or

8-6 per cent by December 1965. Advances bearing rates of interest of 6$ per

cent and above increased from Rs. 537-8 million or 75-8 per cent at the end of

June to Rs. 584-4 million or 81-2 per cent at the end of December 1965 but the

most significant increase was recorded in advances bearing interest at 6i per cent.

Though commercial bank credit to the private sector did not increase

significantly in 1965, there were certain changes within the categories of credit

classified by type of advance, purpose, type of security and by rate of interest

which are of significance. Import bills purchased increased marginally but bank

credit granted for import purposes declined by Rs. 20-0 million. Advances

granted against stock in trade increased. Both export bills purchased and

loans and overdrafts for export purposes declined though total exports

increased-a relationship also observed in 1964.
