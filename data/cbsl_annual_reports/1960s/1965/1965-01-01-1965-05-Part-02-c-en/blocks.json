Gross bank credit to the private sector1 increased only by Rs. 4-2 million in contrast to increases of Rs. 62-8 million in 19642 and Rs. 136.9 million in 1963. Commercial bank credit to Government increased by Rs. 92>3 million, while Central Bank credit to Government declined by Rs. 10-7 million. This is in sharp contrast to 1964 when the increase in commercial bank credit to Govern\u00adment was only Rs. 3-6 million while Central Bank credit to Government increased by as much as Rs. 130 million. The overall increase in credit extended by the banking system to the Government in 1965 was Rs. 81-6 million, which was substantially less than the increase of Rs. 133-6 million in 1964. Net foreign assets owned by the banking system, including transfers to the Central Bank of Government-owned foreign assets, increased by Rs. 79-7 million; but excluding such transfers the increase - for the first time since 1956 - amounted to Rs. 49.6 million.",

    "text": "The pattern of monetary expansion in 1965 shows three distinct differences from the pattern of 1963 and 1964. Whereas in those two previous years mone\u00adtary expansion took place in spite of substantial declines in the foreign assets of the banking system, in 1965 the expansion was due in some measure to an increase in the net external assets held by the banking system. Secondly, while monetary expansion in 1963 and 1964 was caused substantially by commercial bank credit expansion to the private sector, in 1965 this factor had only a very minor effect. Thirdly, while in 1963 and 1964 Central Bank credit to Govern\u00adment was a major expansionary factor, in 1965, the effect of this factor ; was contractionary. In sum, the somewhat mild monetary expansion in 1965 was accounted for by increases in external banking assets and commercial bank credit to the private sector and an increase in commercial bank credit to trie Government sector, compensated to some extent by a decline in Central Bank credit to the Government.3",

Attention was also drawn to the signi\u00adficant change in the composition of currency held between June and December 1964. Table II ( C ) 3 above shows that in 1965, the ratio of currency to total money supply at 52-5 per cent remained almost the same as in .1964- But the composition of currency held underwent a marked change during the course of 1965. Frbm Table II (C) 4 below, it may be noted that between end May and end December 196 notes of Rs. 100 denomination declined sharply by Rs. 130 million whereas notes of Rs. 50 and Rs. 10 denominations increased by Rs. 12 million and Rs. 102 million respectively. In contrast, in the year 1965, wrule total currency liabilities of the Central Bank increased by Rs. 70-7 million, the circulation of notes of the denominations of Rs. 5 and Rs- 10 contracted by Rs. 44-8 million, whereas notes of the denominations Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 increased by Rs. 71-5 million and Rs. 39-5 million respectively. The change from notes of higher denominations to lower denominations experienced in 1964 seems to have been largely reversed in 1965. This seems to confirm the",

This observation cannot, however, be con\u00adfirmed with certainty because it is possible that a substantial proportion of currency notes of the larger denominations were held to facilitate transactions contracted In cash to avoid liability to the debits tax. It is of interest to note that the opera\u00adtion of the Bank debits tax introduced in 1957, coincided with a period of steady fall in the ratio of demand deposits to total money supply. The Bank debits tax was withdrawn with effect from 1st October 1965, but it is yet too early to examine the effect of the withdrawal of the debits tax on the composition of the money supply.",

This sectoral classification identifies the changes originating from the operations of the Government sector and the private sector with the banking system and also from changes in the net external assets held by the banking system. Significant differences are observed in the sectoral origin of changes in the money supply in 1965. The principal cause of monetary expansion in the 5 years prior to 1965 had been the continued increase in the borrowings of the government from the banking system; mostly from the Central Bank and to a lesser degree from commercial banks. In 1963 and 1964 large increases in bank credit to the private sector added to the monetary expansion- This expansion was moderated by the continued increase in time and savings deposits with the banking system, with the exception of the year 1961, and by the depletion of foreign assets held by the banking system.",

On the other hand, commercial bank credit made available to the Government increased by Rs 92-3 million as against an increase of Rs 3-6 million in 1964. This large increase in 1965 is sccounted for mainly by the increase in government import bills held amounting to Rs 59-5 million as against an increase of Rs 3-3 million in 1964. Commercial bank credit to the private sector (excluding export bills) increased by only Rs 11-0 million as compared with an increase of Rs 82-6 million in 1964.

    "text": "In the first quarter of 1965, the money supply contracted markedly by Rs 36-9 million but in each of the subsequent quarters the money supply expanded though irregularly. The money supply was at its lowest for the year in February when it reached a figure of Rs 1,581-9 million, reflecting a decline of Rs 39-9 million below the level at December 1964. From Table II (C) 7 it is observed that the source of monetary contraction in the first quarter of the year * was largely the fall in external banking assets and a reduction in the net government debt held by the banking system. On the other hand, in the second and third quarters of the year, external banking assets recorded substantial increases while the operations of the government with the banking system were also expan\u00adsionary. Gross bank credit to the private sector contracted substantially ini the third quarter of the year while the increase in time and savings deposits contri\u00adbuted significantly to the contractionary factors. This was reflected in the money supply which reached a mid-year peak in July of Rs 1,692-7 million and declined in the last two months of the 3rd quarter. The money supply increased in October but declined in November and increased again in December. The fourth quarter taken as a whole showed a large increase in the money supply, accounted for mainly by the increase in the net government debt held by the banking system and the increase in commercial bank credit to the private sector. External banking assets, however, declined markedly and together with the substantial increase in time and savings deposits moderated the impact of the expansionary factors.",

The Employees' Provident Fund took the largest, share of the increase in Government bonds in 1965, as in 1964, but semi-Government savings institutions continued to be the largest holder of Government bonds. Though the commercial banks were the second largest group holding Govern\u00adment bonds, the increase in their holdings in 1965 was only Rs.2.4 million. Trusts, benevolent, pension and provident fund investments in Government bonds increased by Rs 32.5 million. The Ceylon Insurance Corporation held Rs 97.0 million in Government bonds as at the end of 1965, reflecting an increase of Rs. 42.0 million over the year. Private insurance companies had Rs. 133.9 million invested in Government securities, but the increase amounted to only Rs. 4.7 million for the year. Sinking funds of the Government and other Government funds accounted for 20-4 per cent of the total of Government bonds held in 1965 and 26-1 per cent of the increase for the year. The Employees' Provident Fund, the Insurance Corporation and semi- Government savings institutions accounted for 42-9 per cent of the total Government bonds held in 1965 and for 58 per cent of the increase for the year. The overwhelming predominance of these institutions in the market tor Government bonds has a great bearing on both the level and structure of rates of interest on Government bonds of varyine maturities. Government bonds held by individuals showed an increase of Rs. 3-9 million or 21-2 per cent in 1965. Since the total volume of Government bonds held by individuals is about one per cent of the total outstanding, this increase is without market significance. Yet it is an indication of the revival in the confidence of the private investor.",

This was undoubtedly a reflection of the marked decline in the value of imports in 1965 as compared with 1964. Export bills declined by Rs. 6-5 million in 1965 though the value of exports increased substantially as compared with 1964 in which year too export bills had shown a decline of Rs. 19-2 million whereas the value of exports was markedly above the 1963 level.
