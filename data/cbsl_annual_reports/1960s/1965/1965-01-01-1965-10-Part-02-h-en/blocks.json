As in 1964, about 30 per cent of the strikes were due to loss of employment, 29 per cent due to estate rules, working arrangements etc., 10 per cent due to delays in payments and another 10 per cent on general demands. Only about 3 per cent of the total number of strikes were to support demands for wage increases.",

In the non-plantation sector, the number of man-days lost in 1965, at about 77,000, was far below the average loss for the past decade. In the plantation sector, in spite of some improvement over 1964, the number of man-days lost in 1965 was well above the average for the past decade. The Table II ( H ) - 2 shows the number of strikes, the number of workers involved and the number of man-days lost as a result of strikes.",
