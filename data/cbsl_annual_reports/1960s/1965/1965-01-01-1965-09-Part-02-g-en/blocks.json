First, the index was designed to measure changes in the cost of living of working class families in the city, and as such its use for the purpose of analysing the over\u00adall price increases is limited. Secondly, the pattern of consumption of the working class itself would have changed markedly during the last fifteen years. This index, however, is being made use of in the absence of a better one.",

The import price index of this group, however, was lower in 1965. Despite the fall in import prices, the retail prices of some imported goods, including those not covered by the index, were higher. Scarcities caused by reduced quotas were made use of by traders to put up prices of some imported goods.In the case of butter, for instance, even after the quotas were restored, the price which earlier rose markedly was slow to move downwards. The pressure exerted by the high export prices of coconut products kept the prices of coconuts and coconut oil high in the local market. Due to failure of crop, vegetable prices were high during the year. The price of fish fell presumably because the Fisheries Corporation by opening up its own retail selling points helped to check prices.",

In 1965, however, the prices of textiles declined slightly bslow the prices prevailing over the previous year. This lowering of prices was despite the fact that the volume of textiles imported in 1965 was lower than in 1964 and the import prices of textiles were higher. The decline in the index may have been partly due to the increased ration issued on textile coupons. Another possible explanation is that the comparatively large textile imports during 1964 would have been brought into the market through measures adopted by Government to bring out hoarded goods.",
