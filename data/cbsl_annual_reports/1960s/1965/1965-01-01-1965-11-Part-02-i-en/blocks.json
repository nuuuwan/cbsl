    "text": "Notwithstanding the heavier weight of teas that reached the Colombo Auctions during 1965, the quantities sold increasing by 22 million pounds over the previous year, the prices realised at these auctions during this year were on the average much more favourable than those that obtained in 1964. While the average price fetched by high growns at Rs 1.93 per pound was the same as that of the previous year, the average price of medium growns at Rs. 1.66 per pound rose by 8 cents per pound. The sharpest increase in price was in the case of low growns, whose average at Rs. 1.64 per pound rose by as much as 15 cents per pound. Increased purchases by countries of the Middle East were a major factor contributing to this improvement in price. The average price of all teas Increased by 7 cents per pound to Rs. 1.75 per pound. The average price of high growns showed an improvement of 5 cents per pound during the first quarter of the year, as compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Prices",

The average price of all grades of Ceylon tea sold at these auctions in 1965 amounted to 4sh. 3-15d. per pound, registering a decline of 2-74d. per pound over the previous year. In 1964 this price had increased by l-52d. per pound. Although this decline in the price of Ceylon tea was accompanied by declines in the prices of North Indian and South Indian teas, which fell less sharply by 2-48d. per pound and L05d. per pound respectively, the prices of plain teas of some of the other producing territories, viz., the African territories, Mauritius, Malaya, Argen\u00adtine and Vietnam, recorded quite substantial gains. While the quantity of North Indian teas sold at the London Auctions during this year at 157 million pounds showed no variation from that of the previous year, the quantity of Cey\u00adlon tea sold at these auctions at 120 million pounds increased by 5 million pounds. The average price of all teas sold at the London Auctions during this year at 4sh. 2-17d. per pound declined by l-33d. per pound over 1964. The high level of stocks in the United Kingdom (these stocks at 31st December 1965 amounting to 153 million pounds1 or 33 million pounds more than at the end of 1964), and an estimated decline in tea consumption in that country of 23-5 million pounds in 1965,2 were important contributory factors in the decline in London prices during this year.",

No 1 sheet rubber, which had fallen on the average by around a penny per pound during the years 1962 to 1964, improved by about a penny per pound during 1965, when this price rose to 21|d. per pound from 20 19/32d. per pound during the previous year. There was a similar improvement in the Singapore market, where the f.o.b. price of this grade of rubber at 70-12 Straits cents per pound recorded an increase of 1-98 Straits cents per pound over 1964. Various factors contributed to this improvement during the course of the year, including increased imports by the USSR, rumours of sterling devaluation, political tension in South-East Asia, uncertainties regarding the availability of supplies of Indonesian rubber, and the entry of the People's Republic of China into the Singapore market late in the year.",

While exports of coconut oil and copra declined in volume by 26 per cent and 30 per cent respectively, those of desiccated coconut fell much less sharply, viz., by 4 per cent.",

The average f. o. b. price of desiccated coconut, which had declined by 4 per cent during 1964, staged a pronounced recovery during 1965, rising sharply by 34 per cent. These movements in f. o. b. prices reflected the trends that prevailed in the Colombo market for these products. In this market the year opened with coconut oil prices quite firm, and prices continued to rise steadily reaching peak levels towards the end of the first quarter. Prices thereafter tended to ease somewhat, but remained during the first half of the year at. levels well above those that prevailed during the corresponding quarters of the previous year. Prices reached a low point in September of the year, the average for which month at Rs. 1,069 per ton was only Rs. 19 per ton below the average price realised for the whole of 1964. Prices tended to improve thereafter, and towards the close of the year showed promise of resuming the higher levels reached earlier in the year. The average price for the year at Rs. 1,268 per ton showed an increase of Rs. 180 per ton or 17 per cent over the previous year. The prices of copra moved in general sympathy with those of coconut oil, the average price of Estate No. 1 copra amounting to Rs. 204 per candy and representing an increase of Rs. 36 per candy or 21 per cent over the previous year. The prices of desiccated coconut increased steadily for the most part of the year in line with the general trend of prices of coconut oil and copra. The average price realised for the year at 52 cents per pound showed an increase of 12 cents per pound or 30 per cent over 1964.",

    "text": "Edible oils had a particularly prosperous year in the international markets in 1965 and lauric oils, including coconut oil, shared in this prosperity. The price of coconut oil was particularly strong during the early months of the year, due to increased demand following low stocks held by consumers at the beginning of the year and the expectation, at that time of the year, that Philippine copra production would decline by 20 per cent as a result of damage caused to coconut plantations by typhoons. There was evidence that the supply position of copra was quite tight around April when, partly also due to increased tension over developments in Vietnam, the Philippine's suspended offerings of copra altogether. However, prices tended to ease as the year developed, with supplies of copra becoming more readily available and the expectation of a good soya bean crop in U. S. A . Towards the close of the year prices of coconut oil showed signs of recovery.",

The Food Commissioner's total imports of rice, flour and sugar during 1965 have at Rs. 561 million shown a slight increase of Rs. 4 million or one per cent over 1964, while the Customs data point to a sharp decline in these imports of Rs. 335 million or 52 per cent.

    "text": "by Rs. 59 million or 21 per cent, but this fact is in stark contrast to Customs recorded imports which at Rs. 144 million point to a sharp decline of Rs. 182 million or 56 per cent. Similar discrepancies are in evidence in regard to imports of flour and sugar. While the Food Commissioner's imports of flour at Rs. 135 million have increased by Rs. 35 million or 35 per cent over the previous year, Customs data suggest considerably lower imports of Rs. 98 million, these purpot-ing to represent a decline of Rs. 39 million or 29 per cent over the previous year. The Food Commissioner's imports of sugar at Rs. 84 million show a fall of Rs. 90 million or 52 per cent over the previous year. The Customs data, however, point to lower imports of Rs. 71 million and a fall of Rs. 114 million or 62 per cent over the previous year. These descrepancies in value between actual imports and the Customs recorded data are also reflected in the quanti\u00adties and prices of these imports. While the Food Commissioner's imports of rice, flour and sugar have increased in volume by 17 per cent, 38 per cent and 5 per cent respectively during 1965, the Customs data point to movements in the opposite direction viz., declines in the volume of these imports of 57 per cent, 32 per cent and 28 per cent respectively. Similarly, while the Food Com\u00admissioner's average c and f price of rice has risen by 3 per cent and that of flour has declined by 2 per cent, Customs data point to an increase of 4 per cent In the average price of each of these commodities. The average c and f price of the Food Commissioner's imports of sugar has declined by 54 per cent. The Customs recorded data, on the otherhand, point to a fall of lesser magnitude, viz., 47 per cent.",

The balance of trade with the region, showed a surplus of Rs. 1.6 million, a slight improvement over the previous year. The value of Ceylon's trade with this region, which ten years ago repre\u00adsented less than one per cent of Ceylon's total foreign trade, accounted for 10 per cent of that trade during 1965. As in the previous years, \u201ethe USSR was Ceylon's principal customer of the region, accounting for Rs. 97.2 million or 56 per cent of total exports to the region. These exports, however, showed a dec\u00adline of Rs 3-8 million over 1964. Exports of rubber at Rs. 36-1 million declined sharply by Rs. 13.0 million (27 per cent), and those of coconut oil at Rs. 15.7 million declined by Rs. 1-4 million (8 per cent).

Some of these allocations were subsequently revised, necessitating an increase in the total allocation by Rs. 209 million to Rs. 1,959 million. The major revision concerned the Food Commissioner's imports of rice, flour, sugar and subsidiary foodstuffs, the total allocation for which was increased by Rs. 194 million. The principal reason for this increase was the need to import a larger volume of rice in view of the fall in domestic rice production, which was adversely affected by severe drought conditions. These allocations necessitated further adjustments during the course of the year and their total, as finally revised, amounted to Rs. 1,970 million. The following data represent the original allocations and their subsequent revisions :- \u2022",

In terms of those changes, and as a measure designed to contribute substantially to a reduction in the cost of living, import duties were totally abolished on a number of essentialconsumer items, viz., kerosene oil, chillies, potatoes, onions, dhall, gram and peas, wheat, oats and barley. Import duties on cotton textiles and a few items of synthetic textiles were also reduced, the reduction involving in the case of many of these items a change in the basis of these levies from ad valorem to specific duties. The old duties on synthetic textiles were completely abolished and these items merged with the group of artificial silk textiles, the duties on which were in the. case of most items substantially lower. In addition, import duties were abolished on small agricultural implements, such as mammoties arid alavangoes, and on sports goods-The loss of revenue resulting from these changes in import duties was estimated to be Rs. 18 million.",
