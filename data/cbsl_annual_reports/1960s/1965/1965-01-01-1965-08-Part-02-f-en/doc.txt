Detailed statistics of Ceylon's balance of payments and external assets are

given in Tables 27 to 31 in Appendix II. Balance of payments data are

calculated according to actual receipts and payments obtained from exchange

control records.

Principal Trends

In 1965 there was a change in the general trend that had prevailed for some

years in Ceylon's Balance of Payments. With the exception of isolated surpluses in

the 'Invisibles Account' in 1962 and 1964, Ceylon had experienced persistent

deficits in its Merchandise and Invisibles Accounts and in the 'Basic Balance'.1

The deficit on merchandise account in 1965 was only Rs. 5-0 million, as compared

with a deficit of Rs. 193-0 million in 1964.2 In 1964 Ceylon's balance on

Invisibles Account (inclusive of gifts in kind) showed a surplus of Rs. 33-0 million

which increased to a surplus of Rs. 52-0 in 1965. The combined im­

provement in the merchandise and invisibles accounts of Ceylon's bal­

ance of payments in 1965 helped to transform the current account deficit

from Rs. 160-0 million in 1964 to a surplus of Rs. 47-0 million in 1965. The

basic balance which reflects the country's net external position on both

commercial and long-term capital transactions showed a surplus of Rs. 106-0

million in 1965, as compared with a deficit of Rs. 92-0 million in the previous

year. Consequently Ceylon's external assets (excluding Sterling Loan Sinking

Funds) increased by Rs. 103-0 million to Rs. 408-0 million in 1965 as compared

with a decline of Rs. 54-0 million in 1964; the increase in the external assets in

1965 also reflected net drawings amounting to Rs. 53-4 million from the

International Monetary Fund; the increase was also partly due to the

continuation, though in a modified form, of the moratorium on remittances of

profits and dividends. The favourable view of the trade position in 1965 would

need to be modified in view of the fact that a good proportion of the licences for

imports were issued in the last quarter of 1965 and consequently payments on this

account were not fully reflected in the accounts for the period under review.

Moreover, this favourable trade position has not been achieved without cost to

the economy. Towards the end of the year there were growing shortages and a

marked rise in prices in a number of commodities. In this situation the

Central Bank gave authority to issue another Rs. 35-0 million of licences pending

conclusion of bilateral aid agreement.

1. That is the net position in the balance of payments aftet setting off the cunent and capital account positions-

2. If the merchandise imports in respect of tied aid are excluded the actual trade balance on Ceylon s commericial transactions showed a surplus of Rs, 132 million in 1965 as compared with a deficit of Rs. 39 million in 1964.

Merchandise Account

The balance on merchandise account (including both commercial and aid financed transactions) showed a deficit of Rs. 5-0 million, as compared with a deficit of Rs. 193-0 million in 1964. Export values increased from Rs. 1767-0 million in 1964 to Rs. 1911-0 million in 1965. Import values fell from Rs. 1960-0 million in 1964 to Rs. 1916-0 million in 1965. The value of imports tied to aid declined from Rs. 154-9 million in 1964 to Rs. 137.2 million in 1965. Untied imports declined in value from Rs. 1805.2 million in 1964 to Rs. 1779-0 million in 1965.

The principal factors affecting the favourable trade position in 1965 were a fall in the volume of imports combined with a substantial Increase in the volume of exports. The increased volume of exports was made possible by an increased output of some of Ceylon's major export commodities, particularly of tea. The volume of tea exports increased in 1965 as seen by the increase in its index from 111 in 1964 to 120 in 1965. Rubber and liquid latex exports increased in volume and the index reflected an increase from 122 in 1964 to 137 In 1965. The volume of exports of coconut products and of the eighteen other minor products, however, declined substantially in 1965, the respective indices fell from 181 in 1964 to 142 in 1965 and from 126 in 1964 to 108 in 1965.

The favourable effect on export values arising out of an increased volume of tea exports in 1965 was modified by a fall in tea prices. The export price index of tea fell by two points from 91 in 1964 to 89 in 1965. The export price of rubber, however, remained unchanged on the average in 1965. The decline in the export volume of coconut products was partly compensated by an increase in average price; the price index of coconut products which stood at 93 in 1964 rose to 119 in 1965. The price index of the other minor products showed an increase from 114 in 1964 to 117 in 1965.

The total value of merchandise imports in 1965 amounted to Rs. 1916-0 million as compared with Rs. 1960.0 million in 1964- Of this sum, Rs. 646-5 million consisted of Government imports, reflecting a slight increase over 1964. Private imports and those of Government Corporations amounted to Rs. 1157.7 million showing a decline of Rs. 35-5 million as compared with the previous year. The value of payment on account of rice imports in 1965 amounted to Rs. 267-8 million or Rs. 32.6 million higher than the value of rice imports in 1964. Flour import payments increased in value by Rs. 12-1 million to Rs. 82.8 million The value of sugar import payments declined by Rs. 86.8 million from Rs. 161.9 million in 1964 to Rs. 75-1 million, in 1965, mainly reflecting the fall in the international price of sugar in 1965.

In 1965 the value of loan financed imports amounted to Rs. 77-2 million as compared with Rs. 78.4 million in 1964- The value of grants in kind was Rs. 60.0 million as compared to Rs. 76-4 million in the previous year. The loan com­ponent of imports in 1965 chiefly consisted of disbursements under monies pro­vided by the World Bank (Rs. 10-5 million), U. S. S. R. (Rs. 23-0 million). Canada (Rs. 12-4 million), West Germany (Rs. 10.0 million), China (Rs. 9-5 million), and France (Rs. 6-4 million) for the financing of various development

Ceylon's balance on invisibles account showed an improvement in 1965, reflecting a surplus of Rs. 51.8 million as compared with a surplus of Rs. 32-9 million in 1964, and a deficit of Rs. 6-6 million in 1963. Considering the'fact that the value of grants received in 1965 was Rs. 16.4 million less than in 1964, the improvement in the invisibles account is mainly attributable to a reduction in remittances on account of investment income arising out of the continuation of the moratorium except for a release of a sum of Rs. 2-0 million and a reduction

of Rs. 12-1 million in the deficit on private transfers as a result of lower remi­ttances for the maintenance of dependants abroad and of migrants' transfers.

The surplus on transportation account in the invisibles balance showed an increase in 1965 chiefly due to a reduction in demurrage payments. Recepits from tourist expenditure in Ceylon showed a very slight increase.

The current account in the balance of payments of Ceylon showed a sur­plus of Rs. 4 7 0 million in 1965 as compared with a deficit of Rs. 160-0 million in

1964. During the year 1965, a number of transactions were concluded with the International Monetary Fund with a view to strengthening the external financial position of the country, and particularly with a view to building an adequate cushion of reserves for the purpose of meeting any unforeseen fluct­uations in receipts and payments. In March, 1965, Ceylon made a repurchase of the equivalent of $3-75 million (Rs. 17-9 million) at the International Mone­tary Fund, being the first of three repurchase instalments agreed in respect of the first drawing of $11-25 million (Rs. 53.8 million) in April, 1961. On April 7,

1965, Ceylon's quota was increased to $62 million (Rs. 2954 million) in accord­ance with the Fund's decision on 'Compensatory Financing of Export Fluctuat­ions, adopted on February 27, 1963. Twenty five per cent of the increase in Ceylon's quota, $4.25 million (Rs. 20.2 million) was paid in gold in May, 1965. In April, 1965, Ceylon purchased from the Fund the equivalent of $8 million (Rs. 38-2 million). In July, 1965, Ceylon borrowed a further sum in different currencies equivalent to $15 million (Rs. 71-3 million) from the International Monetary Fund, being the first instalment of a Standby Arrangement for $30 million (Rs. 142-8 million). In October, 1965, Ceylon made a repurchase at he International Monetary Fund, amounting to $3. 75 million (Rs. 17-9 million) being the second instalment repayment in respect of the first drawing of $1L25 million (Rs. 53-8 million) in April, 1961. These transactions led to a net accret­ion of foreign exchange totalling $11-2 million (Rs. 53-4 million). In addition to these Fund transactions a number of short term arrangements were also made with foreign commercial banks to obtain much needed temporary finance during the year 1965.

The net inflow of long term official capital in 1965 amounted to Rs. 61.0 million as compared with Rs. 67.4 million in 1964. Borrowings in 1965 amounted to Rs. 77-2 million and repayments (excluding disbursements from Sterling Loan Sinking Funds) amounted to Rs. 16-2 million. As stated earlier, loan funds disbursed in 1965 were utilized for a variety of development projects. The World Bank loans were utilized for further work on the Second Grandpass Ther­mal Project. The U.S.S.R. loan was used mainly for the establishment of a factory for motor car tyres and tubes. The Canadian loan was utilised for the Maskeliya-OyaValley project. Loans from West Germany were used to finance work on the Ceylon Cement Factory and for Port Development. The assistance from China was principally for the textile industry, while the French assistance was utilized for the Kandy Water Supply Scheme. A United Kingdom loan of Rs. 2-3 million was used for telephone equipment.

In regard to short term liabilities the position as at the end of 1965 showed that Ceylon had reduced her liabilities on account of transactions with Payments Agreements countries by Rs. 68-6 million to Rs. 0-7 million. In addition, in 1965, Ceylon obtained a settlement of Rs. 31-7 million in Sterling on account of balances in Ceylon's favour in excess of the swing credit in her merchandise trans* actions under the Payments Agreements. At the end of 1964, in contrast, Ceylon had accumulated short term liabilities amounting to Rs. 69-3 million in merchan­dise transactions under Payments Agreements.

Ceylon's regional balance of payments on current account (inclusive of loans and grants) showed a surplus of Rs. 46-9 million in 1965, in contrast to a deficit of Rs. 160-4 million in 1964. The principal features of the improved current account balance in 1965 were a substantial reduction in the deficit with Sterling Area and an improvement in the trading balance with Payments Agree­ments Countries. The traditional surplus with the Dollar Area was reduced further in 1965, from Rs. 163-7 million in 1964 to Rs. 151-1 million in 1965. Since the increase in import values from the Dollar Area in 1965 was counter­balanced almost proportionately by increased aid, the adverse trade position in 1965 was almost entirely due to a fall in export earnings. The deficit of Rs. 161-1 million incurred with the Sterling Area in 1964 was reduced to a deficit of only Rs. 21-9 million in 1965, mainly due to an increase in export earnings by Rs. 61-4 million to Rs. 1010-9 million and a fall in import payments by Rs. 77-8 million to Rs. 1032-8 million. The current account surplus with the United Kingdom increased from Rs. 9-0 million in 1964 to Rs. 71-8 million in 1965, chiefly due to a fall of Rs. 53-7 million in import payments accompanied by a small increase in export earnings. There was also a reduction of Rs. 45-3 million in the trade deficit with India mainly due to a reduction of Rs. 62-9 million in import pay­ments, even though export earnings fell by Rs. 17-6 million. Ceylon's trans­actions with payments Agreements countries showed a surplus of Rs. 61-5 million in 1965 as compared with a deficit of Rs. 74-2 million in 1964. The current account surplus with China amounted to Rs. 47-5 million while the balance with the Soviet Bloc showed a surplus of Rs. 14-0 million. Exports to China rose by Rs. 29-0 million as compared with 1964 while import payments declined by Rs. 46-4 million. Export earnings in respect of the Soviet bloc increased by Rs. 41-0 million while import payments fell by Rs. 19.3 million. The balance

on transactions with the O.E.C.D. group of countries showed a deficit of Rs.95-3 million as compared with a deficit of Rs. 61.1 million in 1964, the principal factor being an increase of Rs. 35-6 million in import payments, approximately a third of which constituted aid financed imports.

Foreign Reserves

The gross external assets of Ceylon increased by Rs. 88-9 million to Rs. 439.9 million in 1965. External assets net of Sterling Loan Sinking Funds amounted to Rs. 408.0 million at the end of 1965, as against Rs. 305-0 million at the end of 1964. Gross external assets at the end of December 1964 had amounted to Rs. 351-0 million. In the first quarter of 1965 these assets declined by Rs. 9-7 million, notwithstanding foreign borrowings amounting to Rs. 51-2 million. The second quarter of 1965, however, showed an increase of Rs. 10-1 million mainly due to an easing of payments on imports. The improvement in reserves continued in the third quarter and was chiefly assisted by a drawing of Rs. 71*3 million from the International Monetary Fund, a decline in remittances of profits and dividends resulting from the moratorium, and a favourable movement in the balance on merchandise accourtt principally due to delays in the licensing of imports. Up to the end of the third quarter gross external assets had risen by Rs. 165-3 million. The position was however, reversed in the fourth quarter when external assets fell by Rs. 76-4 million as a result of a number of factors. In the first place there was a Sterling Loan repayment amounting to Rs. 24-6 million combined with a repurchase obligation of Rs. 17-9 million at the International Monetary Fund. Secondly the issue of import licences in the second half of 1965 also resulted in an acceleration in payments on merchandise account. Finally, in the last quarter of 1965, a significant proportion of deferred liabilities in res­pect of Payments Agreements countries, mainly in respect of oil imports were settled. All these factors, therefore contributed partly towards modifying the general improvement in external assets that occurred in 1965.
