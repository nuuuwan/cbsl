The principal features of the improved current account balance in 1965 were a substantial reduction in the deficit with Sterling Area and an improvement in the trading balance with Payments Agree\u00adments Countries. The traditional surplus with the Dollar Area was reduced further in 1965, from Rs. 163-7 million in 1964 to Rs. 151-1 million in 1965. Since the increase in import values from the Dollar Area in 1965 was counter\u00adbalanced almost proportionately by increased aid, the adverse trade position in 1965 was almost entirely due to a fall in export earnings. The deficit of Rs. 161-1 million incurred with the Sterling Area in 1964 was reduced to a deficit of only Rs. 21-9 million in 1965, mainly due to an increase in export earnings by Rs. 61-4 million to Rs. 1010-9 million and a fall in import payments by Rs. 77-8 million to Rs. 1032-8 million. The current account surplus with the United Kingdom increased from Rs. 9-0 million in 1964 to Rs. 71-8 million in 1965, chiefly due to a fall of Rs. 53-7 million in import payments accompanied by a small increase in export earnings. There was also a reduction of Rs. 45-3 million in the trade deficit with India mainly due to a reduction of Rs. 62-9 million in import pay\u00adments, even though export earnings fell by Rs. 17-6 million. Ceylon's trans\u00adactions with payments Agreements countries showed a surplus of Rs. 61-5 million in 1965 as compared with a deficit of Rs. 74-2 million in 1964. The current account surplus with China amounted to Rs. 47-5 million while the balance with the Soviet Bloc showed a surplus of Rs. 14-0 million. Exports to China rose by Rs. 29-0 million as compared with 1964 while import payments declined by Rs. 46-4 million. Export earnings in respect of the Soviet bloc increased by Rs. 41-0 million while import payments fell by Rs. 19.3 million. The balance",

    "text": "The gross external assets of Ceylon increased by Rs. 88-9 million to Rs. 439.9 million in 1965. External assets net of Sterling Loan Sinking Funds amounted to Rs. 408.0 million at the end of 1965, as against Rs. 305-0 million at the end of 1964. Gross external assets at the end of December 1964 had amounted to Rs. 351-0 million. In the first quarter of 1965 these assets declined by Rs. 9-7 million, notwithstanding foreign borrowings amounting to Rs. 51-2 million. The second quarter of 1965, however, showed an increase of Rs. 10-1 million mainly due to an easing of payments on imports. The improvement in reserves continued in the third quarter and was chiefly assisted by a drawing of Rs. 71*3 million from the International Monetary Fund, a decline in remittances of profits and dividends resulting from the moratorium, and a favourable movement in the balance on merchandise accourtt principally due to delays in the licensing of imports. Up to the end of the third quarter gross external assets had risen by Rs. 165-3 million. The position was however, reversed in the fourth quarter when external assets fell by Rs. 76-4 million as a result of a number of factors. In the first place there was a Sterling Loan repayment amounting to Rs. 24-6 million combined with a repurchase obligation of Rs. 17-9 million at the International Monetary Fund. Secondly the issue of import licences in the second half of 1965 also resulted in an acceleration in payments on merchandise account. Finally, in the last quarter of 1965, a significant proportion of deferred liabilities in res\u00adpect of Payments Agreements countries, mainly in respect of oil imports were settled. All these factors, therefore contributed partly towards modifying the general improvement in external assets that occurred in 1965.",
