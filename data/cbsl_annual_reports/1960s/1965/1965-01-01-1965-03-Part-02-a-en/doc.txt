( A ) National Product and Expenditure

Introduction

Ceylon's gross national product at current factor cost prices in 1965 is provisionally estimated at Rs. 7,388 million compared to a revised estimate of Rs. 7,104 million in 1964. The rate of increase in 1965 was 4*0 per cent compared to the rate of increase of 5-8 per cent in 1964. In 1965, the rates of expansion in the value of net output of the export sector and the domestic sector were not as large as in the previous year. Although the value of tea and rubber exports increased, the exports of coconut products declined on account of a fall in the output of coconuts. This, together with a fall in export stocks, resulted in the net contribution of the export sector to gross national product recording a rise of only 2-2 per cent as against a rise of 5-4 per cent in the previous year. In the domestic sector, adverse weather conditions caused a fall in the net output of paddy by 31-2 per cent. However, the value of net output of other goods and services, mainly fish, livestock and industrial production, trade, transport and Government services continued to increase, resulting in a rise in the value of net output of the domestic sector by 4-1 per cent compared to the rise of 5-5 per cent in 1964.

In real terms, that is, at constant* prices, gross national product increased from a revised figure of Rs. 6,888 million in 1964, to Rs. 7,024 million in 1965, which is an increase of 2-0 per cent, compared to a rise of 4*4 per cent in the previous year. The value of net output of the export sector which had increased by 6-4 per cent in 1964 fell by 0-8 per cent while that of the domestic sector rose by 2-5 per cent as against the rise of 3-3 per cent in the previous year.

The rate of population increase in 1965 according to provisional estimates was the same as in 1964, i.e., 2 4 per cent. Taking into account the increase in population, gross national product per capita shows an increase of 1-7 per cent at current prices and a decrease of 0-4 per cent at constant prices.

In contrast to 1964, when the terms of trade deteriorated by 2-6 per cent, in 1965 the terms of trade showed an improvement of 1-2 per cent. Consequently, real national income increased by 2-2 per cent, i. e., at a rate higher than the rate of increase of the real product, viz., 2-0 per cent.

In 1965, gross national expenditure at current market prices recorded only a moderate increase. While private consumption expenditure increased slightly in 1965, capital formation in the private sector and public corporations fell. In the Government sector however, while consumption continued to increase though at a slower rate, capital formation rose substantially as against a drop in the previous year. These changes resulted in a rise in the total gross national expenditure by 3-2 per cent compared to the rise of 7-2 per cent in 1964.

Table II ( A ) - 2 shows gross national product and its components at current factor cost prices. In 1965, production for export which accounted for some

21 per cent of the gross national product recorded a smaller growth than in 1964.

The value of tea and rubber exports rose by 6-0 per cent and 4-9 per cent respectively. The quantity of tea exported increased by 8-5 per cent, though its -f. o. b. price as reflected by the export price index fell by 2-4 per cent- Similar trends were observed in the case of rubber. The quantity of exports rose by

5-4 per cent, while the average f. o. b. price fell slightly by 0-4 per cent. In the case of coconut, however, on account of a fall in the output, the volume of

coconut exports in terms of nut equivalent fell by 21-6 per cent in 1965 compared to the rise of 33-7 per cent in 1964. Since the export prices of coconut products increased sharply, the prices of copra and coconut oil rising by 24-9 per cent and 27-0 per cent respectively, the value of coconut exports declined by only 1-8 per cent. The fall in the output of coconut in 1965 was due to adverse weather conditions.

The value of total exports thus increased by 4*0 per cent compared to an increase of 8-1 per cent in the previous year. However, estimates of export stocks indicate a fall of Rs. 75 million. The value of net output of the export sector which takes into account the change in the value of stocks therefore recorded a rise of only 2-2 per cent. This is in contrast to the rise of 5-4 per cent in the value of net output of the export sector in 1964.

The value of net output of the domestic sector too, increased at a lower rate in 1965. Owing to adverse weather conditions, the quantity of paddy produced fell from 50-5 million bushels to 35-6 million bushels, a fall of 29-5 per cent. The increase in the value of net output of the domestic sector arose principally from the expansion in the output of industry, livestock and fish, Government and other services. The value of net output of industrial production is provisionally estimated to have increased by 10-8 per cent. Notable increases occurred in the production of plastics, cement and cement products. The net output of fish production is estimated to have risen by 11-0 per cent. In the case of Govern­ment, an increase in expenditure on capital formation principally in agriculture and a rise in current expenditure on health and education were responsible for the rise in the value of net output.

Total gross domestic product, that is the sum of net output in the export and domestic sectors, rose from a revised figure of Rs. 7,140 million in 1964 to Rs. 7,404 million, that is by 3-7 per cent. The outflow of investment income fell from Rs. 36 million in 1964 to Rs 15 million in 1965 as a result of the continua­tion of the moratorium on the transfer of dividends and profits introduced in the 1964/65 Budget. Consequently, the rise in the gross national product at 4 0 per cent was higher than the rise in the gross domestic product.

Details of locally produced goods for domestic consumption valued at producers' prices are shown in Table II (A)-3. The principal changes in the producers' value of these goods are in respect of paddy, livestock and industrial production. The producers' value of paddy fell by 29-8 per cent due to crop failure in both Maha 1964/65 and Yala 1965. According to provisional data, livestock production rose by 20-1 per cent on account of increases in meat and milk production. The rise in producers' value of industrial production at 9-9 per cent is the result of increases in both ex-factory price and output.

Figures of gross national expenditure at current market prices, estimated as the sum of consumption and capital formation are shown in Table II (A)-4-Table II ( A ) - 5 shows estimates of gross national expenditure computed as the sum of gross national product and net indirect taxes. In contrast to the rise of 7-2 per cent in 1964, gross national expenditure rose by only 3-2 per cent in 1965. The relatively small Increase in 1965 reflects a reduction in the imports of personal consumption goods as well as capital goods in this year.

Private consumption expenditure increased only slightly by M per cent in 1965: an increase in private consumption expenditure on locally produced goods and services was largely offset by a reduction in expenditure on imports. Govern­ment consumption expenditure expanded by 2*4 per cent which was lower than the rate of increase of 7*9 per cent in the previous year. Fixed capital forma­tion in the private sector and public corporations fell by 14*6 per cent reflecting a reduction in the imports of capital goods, but fixed capital formation in the Government and public exterprise sectors rose by 13-6 per cent.

Total fixed capital formation in both private and Government sectors thus fell by 5*3 per cent, whereas in 1964 it had recorded a rise of 3-2 per cent.

Details of private consumption expenditure at current market prices are shown in Table II(A)-6. It will be seen from this table that the fall in consumer expenditure on imports relates to items other than rice, flour and sugar. Data on expenditure* on imported rice, flour and sugar show an increase of 15-7 per cent in 1965. Consumer expenditure on other imports, however, shows a sharp reduction of 18-2 per cent in contrast to the rise of 20-0 per cent in the previous year.

Consumer outlay on locally produced goods continued to expand in 1965. Expenditure on coconut products showed an increase of 18-4 per cent owing to a rise in the retail price of coconut in 1965. According to provisional data, expenditure on livestock products increased by 18.6 per cent as a result of increased meat and milk consumption. Expenditure on local rice, however, recorded a sharp decline of 25-8 per cent reflecting the reduction in the output of paddy due to the crop failure mentioned earlier.

Details of capital formation are shown in Table II ( A ) - 7 . Figures of capital formation in the private sector and public corporations are estimated largely on the basis of imports ot capital goods. In 1965, fixed capital formation in this sector fell by 14.6 per cent, reflecting a decrease in the imports of capital goods. Thus building and certain other construction which accounts for more than one half of total capital formation in the private sector fell by 7-3 per cent. Invest-i ment in plant and machinery and 'other' capital goods also fell by 32-5 per cent and 46-5 per cent respectively, while investment in transport rose by 25-1 per cent.

The fall in fixed capital formation in the private sector was somewhat offset by an increase in fixed capital formation in the Government sector. While fixed capital formation by the enterprise departments, mainly Railway and Electrical Departments, rose by 22-7 per cent, investment by other Government Departments, particularly of agriculture and irrigation, rose by 9-7 per cent. Total gross domestic fixed capital formation thus fell by only 5.3 per cent;

* These figures relate to actual issues by the Food Department of rice, flour, and sugar for consumption through co-operative stores and registered dealers. The sharp rise in the above figures in 1965, which is in respect of rice and flour, probably means an increase in the stocks of these commodities held by the co-operatives and dealers. It is therefore, likely, that the actual increase in consumption of total rice, flour and sugar was less.

Availability and the Use of Resources

Table II ( A ) - 8 sets out on the one hand resources made available to the country through production and imports and on the other hand, how the available resources were distributed between consumption, gross domestic capital formation and exports.

In 1965, total resources available increased by only 1-8 per cent compared to an increase of 6-1 per cent in 1964- This increase was due to an expansion in domestic production, imports having fallen by 2-1 per cent. In regard to utilisation, while resources used for consumption rose by 1-3 per cent those for capital formation fell by 5-9 per cent. Resources used for exports increased by 7-4 per cent.

In the recent pastj resources available through current production had been insufficient to meet gross domestic expenditure and consequently it had been necessary to draw on the country's external reserves or increase external liabilities. In 1965, however, resources available from current production were in excess of gross domestic expenditure. These changes are set forth in Table II (A)-9. This table shows that whereas from 1959 to 1964, gross domestic expenditure had varied between 101-5 per cent and 103-7 per cent of gross national product, in 1965, gross domestic expenditure was only 99-9 per cent.

Table II ( A ) - 1 0 shows the import content of public consumption, private consumption and capital formation. The substantial fall in imports of consumer goods in 1965 reduced the import content of private consumption from 25-4 per cent to 16-6 per cent at c. i. f. prices and from 33-1 per cent to 30-2 per cent at market prices. Again, reflecting the fall in imports of capital goods, the import content of capital formation fell from 28-8 per cent to 23-7 per cent at

Cross Domestic Product by Industrial Origin

Table 11 ( A ) - 1 1 shows gross domestic product by industrial origin. With the fall in the production of coconut and paddy, the contribution to gross domestic product by the group 'Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries' declined from 44 per cent in 1964 to 41 per cent in 1965. The relative importance of 'Manufacturing' which had been steadily rising from 5 per cent in 1959 to 8 per cent in 1964 remained unchanged in 1965. The share of all other goods and services, however, rose from 48 per cent in 1964 to 51 per cent in 1965.

Real Product, Real Income and Real Expenditure

Estimates of gross national product at constant prices are shown in Table II ( A ) - 1 2 . In contrast to the rise of 4-4 per cent in 1964, gross national product at constant prices increased by only 2-0 per cent in 1965. The real value of exports which had increased by 8-7 per cent in the previous year, rose by only 2-1 per cent in 1965. Although the quantity of tea and rubber exports as reflected by estimates at constant prices, increased by 8-7 per cent and 5-4 per cent respectively, the volume of exports of the three major coconut products decreased sharply by 21-6 per cent. When account is taken of the change in export stocks which are estimated to have fallen, real value of the net output of export sector recorded a fall of 0-8 per cent.

In the domestic sector, the real output of the group 'Paddy, Tea and Coconut' fell by 19-2 per cent due to the crop failure in paddy. While net output of the Government rose by 3-7 per cent, that of other goods and services rose by 7.6 per cent. Gross domestic product increased by 1-7 per cent in 1965. The outflow of investment income in 1965 was smaller than in the previous year. Total gross national product which includes investment income increased by 2-0 per cent. In 1965, Ceylon's population is estimated to have increased by 2 4 per cent. Since real product increased by only 2-0 per cent, per capita real product fell by 0-4 per cent.

Table II (A)-13 shows estimates of real national income obtained by adjusting the real product for the terms of trade effect. In contrast to the previous year when terms of trade deteriorated by 2-6 per cent, 1965 recorded an improvement of 1-2 per cent. Hence the terms of trade effect which was -316 in 1964 improved to -309 in 1965. In 1965, whereas real product incre­ased by 2-0 per cent, real national income rose by 2-2 per cent.

Table II ( A ) - 1 4 shows the production of the principal agricultural crops. Tea production which had a setback in 1964 when it declined slightly, showed an increase in 1965. Rubber production too showed an increase, though the rate of increase was slightly smaller than in the previous year. In each of the crops tea and rubber, an increase in the replanted acreage coming into bearing contributed to the increase in output. Coconut and paddy production on the other hand both recorded substantial decreases as a result of adverse weather conditions.

Tea

The area under tea at the end of 1965 was 594,298 acres compared to 591,989 acres at the end of 1964. Tea production in 1965 showed an increase of 21 million pounds or 4- 4 per cent from 482 million pounds in 1964 to a record level of 503 million pounds. This increase is attributed to the scientific applica­tion of fertilizer, favourable weather conditions and more replanted areas coming into maturity. The average yield per acre increased from 814 pounds in 1964 to 848 pounds in 1965.

The quantity of tea exported in 1965 amounted to 495 million pounds as compared with 456 million pounds in 1964. The value of exports rose from Rs. 1,142 million to Rs. 1,210 million.

Rubber

The area under rubber at the end of 1965 amounted to 671,487 acres,

of which 229,335 acres or 34 per cent represented the area replanted

under the Replanting Subsidy Scheme. The acreage replanted under this

scheme during 1965 was 12,501 acres compared to 13,553 acres during

the previous year.

Rubber production rose from 246 million pounds in 1964 to 261 million

pounds in 1965, that is, an increase of 15 million pounds or 6. 1 per cent. The

increase in rubber production in 1965 is the result of more replanted acres

coming into bearing. The average yield per acre is estimated to have increased

from 450 pounds in 1964 to 468 pounds (provisional) in 1965.

The volume of rubber exported increased from 253 million pounds in 1964

to 267 million pounds in 1965 showing an increase of 5-4 per cent as against a

rise of 20-9 per cent in 1964. However, since average f .o.b. price declined slightly

from Rs. 1.15 in 1964 to Rs. 1-14 in 1965, the value of rubber exported rose by

only 4-9 per cent.

Coconut

Coconut production estimated as the nut equivalent of internal consump­

tion and exports showed a decline of 10. 6 per cent from 3,000 million nuts in

1964 to 2,681 million nuts in 1965. The nut equivalent of coconut exports

decreased from 1,626 million nuts in 1964 to 1,274 million nuts in 1965 i.e., by

21-6 per cent. The decrease in coconut production is a result of unfavourable

weather conditions.

Paddy

In 1965, adverse weather conditions affected both the Maha and Yala

crops severely, resulting in a sharp decline in paddy production. While output

during the Maha season was 23.1 million bushels as compared with 32.1

million bushels in the previous Maha, the Yala crop is tentatively estimated by the

Department of Census and Statistics at 12.5 million bushels only, as against

18-4 million bushels in the previous Yala. Total production in both seasons

therefore, decreased from 50-5 million bushels in 1964 to 35-6 million bushels

registering a decrease of 29-5 per cent as compared to the rise of 2-6 per cent in

1964. The average yield per acre harvested fell from 38-8 bushels in 1964 to

33-0 bushels in 1965,

( 35 )

* This estimate is based on issues of rice by the Food Department for consumption through Co—operatives and registered dealers, which as explained in the footnote on page 23 is likely to be overstated. Hence, the figure of actual consumption of rice is likely to be less than this amount.

The rice equivalent of paddy production is provisionally estimated at

497,100 tons as against a revised figure of 705,200 tons in 1964. Rice imports

increased from 547,000 tons in 1964 to 642,000 tons in 1965. The fall in rice

production is reflected in a decrease in the quantity of paddy purchased under

the Guaranteed Price Scheme from 29-8 million bushels in 1964 to 21-3 million

bushels in 1965. Total consumption of rice in 1965 is provisionally estimated at

1,120,400* tons compared to a revised'figure cf 1,145,400* tons in 1964.
