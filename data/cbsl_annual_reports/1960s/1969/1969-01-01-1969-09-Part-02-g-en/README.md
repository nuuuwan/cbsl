(G) B A L A N C E O F P A Y M E N T S AND E X T E R N A L ASSETS

Detailed statistics of Ceylon's balance of payments and external assets are available in Tables 43 to 47 in Appendix. Balance of payments data are derived from exchange control records of actual receipts and payments during the year. These figures will differ from the statistics used in the Foreign Trade Section, which are based on Customs Returns.

A. Background and Trends

Ceylon's balance of payments, as in past years, continued to exhibit elements of weakness. Adverse trends in the world economy, in terms of both commodity prices and the cost and availability of financing facilities, were aggravated in the case of some export products, with shortfalls in exports, result­ing in a decline in aggregate export values. A small improvement in income from services occurred in 1969, but this was more than offset by an increase in payments for merchandise imports, services, capital amortization and interest. The volume of imports in 1969 was augmented by a substantial increase in the flow of official capital. This reflected in part, the increasing capacity of the country to absorb both maintenance and capital goods imports, as also evidenced, by the contemporaneous increase in Ceylon's Gross Domestic Product.

In recent years, major objectives of economic policy have centred upon increasing the country's Gross Domestic Product, ensuring price stability, and balance in its international payments. In view of the general shortage of resources, particularly foreign exchange resources, such a policy requires as a datum, a vigorous expansion of export income, in terms of both goods and services. It concurrently necessitates a change in the composition of imported inputs in favour of goods that are specifically orientated to export earning or import saving industries on the one hand, and a reduction in the volume of dispensable imports, or those which could be substituted from purely domestic production, on the other.

The need for an absolute reduction in the value of imports is parti­cularly relevent in a situation where export incomes are stagnant or declining, in the face of a substantial increase in contractual payments abroad, particularly those related to debt service and the repatriation of investment income.

The imposition of such policy criteria in the context of Ceylon's economy has now become an urgent need. One of the performance criteria for judging the ability of the economy to pay its way in its international settlements is the share of export income and import payments in Gross Domestic Product. The share of external debt service in the country's Gross Domestic Product is also a measure of the savings that need to be generated each year and in a sense reflects the minimum rate of return that needs to be secured on borrowed external capital, in order that the country may meet its external obligations, without diminishing welfare.

Table 1 below, affor ds evidence tha t purposeful policy measures should continue to be applied in order to ensure that the required criteria for ensuring a viable external payments situation are fulfilled. It is observed, for example

( 190 )

that the percentage share of merchandise exports in Gross Domestic Product has increased from 19.9 per cent, in 1967 to 20.0 per cent, in 1968. But significantly enough, in 1969, a year in which heavy external payments were made, the share of merchandise exports in Gross Domestic Product fell, as compared with 1968. The combined income derived from goods and services shows a similar trend. Meanwhile the share of imports (both of goods and services) out of own resources, fell by a much smaller percentage; it amounted to 23.5 per cent and 23.2 per cent of G.D.P. in 1967 and 1968, respectively, and fell to 22.1 per cent of G.D.P. in 1969.

Likewise, the share of capital amortization in Gross Domestic Product has more than trebled from 0.9 per cent in 1967 to 3.6 per cent, in 1969. While, therefore, total external payments, expressed as a percentage of the country's GDP have increased from 24.4 per cent, in 1967 to 25.6 per cent, in 1969, the country's external income, as measured by its earnings on goods and services, has declined from 22.5 per cent, of GDP in 1967, to 20.0 per cent, of GDP in 1969. Concurrently the 'resource gap', as measured by the difference between the sum of earnings from exports of goods and services and the sum of payments for goods and services and capital amortization, has increased from 5.0 per cent, of GDP in 1967, to 11.0 per cent, of GDP in 1969.

The existence of a 'resource gap' of this magnitude may be a reflection of the country's increasing capacity to absorb the type of external resources that are germane to its development effort. This has however, to be viewed against the slow growth in income from the export of goods and services, which in the final analysis, is required to reduce or eliminate the resource gap.

( 191 )

While the increasing share of external debt amortization and the poor export performance in respect of goods and services, are by themselves disquieting features, a less significant feature of Ceylon's external payments, viz. the mode of financing the resource gap, has assumed particular importance, in 1969. Table 2 below, illustrates the 'resource gap' that emerged in the years 1968 and 1969, and the respective modes of financing.

The resource gap which amounted to Rs. 649 million in 1968, increased to Rs. 1,198 million in 1969. Quite apart from the substantial increase in the size of the gap, a striking feature is the shift in the modes by which it has been financed. In 1969, much larger recourse has been made to short-term financing mechanisms, as compared with 1968. The shares of commodity aid, grants, private capital and drawings from the International Monetary Fund have declined, while the use of foreign bank borrowings, short-term credits and Ceylon's external assets, has increased. The shift in the composition of»modes of financing has been primarily a result of a substantial reduction in the volume of financing available from the I.M.F. in 1969, as compared with 1968; in 1968 drawings from the I.M.F. financed 32.8 per cent of the resource gap, whereas in 1969, its share declined to only 6.4 per cent.

The increasing resort to short-term financing mechanisms in 1969, was to some extent, a result of factors over which Ceylon had little or no control. Thus, for example, when the foreign exchange expenditure for 1969 was programmed towards the end of 1968, merchandise export income was forecast at approxi­mately Rs. 2031 million. On this basis the value of imports for the year had been programmed. However, the collapse of tea prices beyond anticipated levels, combined with a poor export performance in respect of coconut products, posed a serious dilemma for balance of payments management in 1969. Sharp and sudden cuts in the import licensing programme were not feasible, without

( 192 )

jeopardising the goals of realizing the government's investment plans, and, the maximization of capacity utilization and price stabilization of essential con­sumer goods.

The balance of payments had, therefore, to be increasingly supported by short-term foreign bank borrowings and use of Ceylon's external assets. The average level of outstanding short-term foreign bank borrowings increased from Rs. 27.3 million and Rs. 87.6 million in the first and second quarters, respectively, to Rs. 196.9 million in the third quarter, and, averaged Rs. 194.5 million in the fourth quarter. Borrowings were particularly heavy in the month of December, (averaging Rs. 214.6 million), because of a sharp fall in export earnings, arising from the strike in the Port of Colombo. Heavy payments for imports were continuing to be made in the meanwhile.

B . External Resources and their Use.

i . Merchandise Account

Table A on page 196 gives details of Ceylon's balance of payments performance in 1969, as compared with 1963. Income from merchandise exports totalled Rs. 1909 million, showing a decline of Rs. 67 millon, as compared with the previous year. It also reflected a shortfall of Rs. 122 millon, as compared with the Foreign Exchange Budget forecast, for the year 1969. A detailed analy­sis of the factors influencing the volume and value of exports in 1969, are given in the Foreign Trade Section, on pages 216 to pages 246.

The value of merchandise imports in 1969, on an exchange record basis, is estimated at Rs. 2653 millon. This is Rs. 297 million more than the value in 1968. Of the total value of merchandise imports in 1969, imports out of the country's own resources totalled Rs. 2072 million, or Rs. 39 million more than in 1968.

Consequently the trade deficit, when measured on an own resour­ces basis, amounted to Rs. 163 millon, as compared with a trade deficit of Rs-57 million in 1968. The substantial increase in the trade deficit in 1969, on an own resources basis, has as indicated earlier, been due to an unexpected fall of Rs. 122 millon in actual export income, as compared with the Foreign Exchange Budget forecast, combined with an increase of Rs. 39 million in merchandise import payments in 1969, as compared with the previous year.

The availability of aid and suppliers' credit imports totalling Rs. 581 million, (or Rs. 158 million more than in 1968), enabled Ceylon to increase the value of her imports to Rs. 2653 million, c.i.f., in 1969, as compared with Rs. 2356 million c.i.f. in 1968. This aid raised the nominal trade deficit, ( i.e. the deficit inclusive of aid imports) to Rs. 744 million, as compared with Rs. 380 million, in 1968.

Table B, on page 198 gives details of import values by principal categories and commodities, for the years 1966-1969. Total import values have increased from Rs. 2356 million in 1968 toRs. 2653 millon in 1969. However, there has been a significant shift in the composition of imports. With the exception of flour, sugar and textile imports, there has been a shift in favour of intermedi­

ate and capital goods, indicative of the structural changes taking place in the economy. Of considerable significance is the reduction of Rs. 74 million (or 22

per cent) in the payments made on rice imports in 1969, as compared with 1968.

2. Services Account:

The Services Account showed a modest deficit of Rs. 3 million (exc­luding grants) in 1968. This increased to Rs. 64 million in 1969. This fact has been one of the important contributory causes of the deterioration of the balance of payments in 1969. The value of income on services account increa­sed from Rs. 255 million in 1968 to Rs. 273 million in 1969. The value of pay­ments, however, increased by much more, from Rs. 258 million in 1968 to Rs.

337 million in 1969.

The marked increase in the deficit on services in 1969, as compared with 1968, reflects a worsening of the deficit on investment income account. This deficit which amounted to Rs. 53 million in 1968, increased to Rs. 104 million in 1969. Interest payments increased from Rs. 42 million in 1968, to Rs. 57 million in 1969. Remittance of profits and dividends rose from Rs. 24 million in 1968, to Rs. 62 million in 1969, largely reflecting releases of blocked mora­torium funds. This also reflects remittances in 1969 of moratorium funds held up in 1968 pending finalization of the method of treatment of moratorium remittances under the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme. The deficit on miscellaneous services increased as a result of increased payments on account of professional and technical consultancy services and fees. These related primarily to government investment projects. There was also an increase in expenditure related to export promotion abroad.

Receipts from tourism increased from Rs. 11 million (or U.S. $ 1.8 million,) in 1968 to Rs.17 million (or U.S. $ 2.9 million) in 1969, or by 55 per cent. The total number of tourists visiting Ceylon in 1969 is estimated at 40,204, as com­pared with 28,272 in 1968. This represents an increase of 42 per cent. Thus the rate of increase in earnings from tourism in 1969 was higher than the rate of increase in tourist traffic. Earnings per head increased from Rs. 364 (or U.S. $ 61.2) in 1968 to Rs. 423 (or U.S. $ 71.1) in 1969. The improvement in earnings from tourism in 1969, is attributable both to the improvement in tourist infra-structure that has occurred and to the premium exchange rate offered to tourists, in combination with an improvement in exchange control procedures.

Another encouraging feature in the services account for the year 1969, as compared with the previous year, has been an improvement in receipts from private transfers. Such receipts increased from Rs. 8 million in 1968 to

T A B L E II (G) 4

Changes in Major Sectors in the Services Account — 1 9 6 8 and 1 9 6 9

( 195 )

Rs. 12 million in 1969, or by 50 per cent. Inward private transfers are eligible to the benefits of the Foreign Exchange Entitlment Certificate Scheme and this fact may have encouraged the flow of such funds into Ceylon in the course of 1969. The prevailing scarcity of credit facilities in Ceylon, may have been an additional factor.

3. Capital Account:

The external resource gap in 1969 amounted to Rs. 1193 million, as compared with Rs. 649 million in 1968. The financing of this gap was made possible by long term capital inflows (including private capital), the use of trade credits (including bilateral trade credits), foreign short-term bank borrowings, drawings from the I.M.F. and the use of Ceylon's external assets. Details of such capital flows are given in Table C, on page 199.

The value of commodity aid imports increased from Rs. 255 million in 1968, to Rs. 272 million in 1969, while the value of project aid more than doubled from Rs. 40 million in 19b8, to Rs. 89 million in 1969. Over the same period, the value of grants increased from Rs. 28 million to Rs. 46 million. Aid imports financed 22 per cent of Ceylon's merchandise imports in 1969, as com­pared with 14 per cent in 1968. The share of suppliers credits and short term trade credits in total imports has also shown a tendency to increase in 1969.

There was a marked increase in short-term bank borrowings in 1969, combined with a draw down of external assets. Outstanding short-term foreign bank borrowings at the end of 1969 amounted to Rs. 255. 9 million while Ceylon's external assets had been drawn down by Rs. 85. 9 million. Drawings from the International Monetary Fund amounted to Rs. 77 million, as compared with Rs. 213 million in 1968.

An increasing proportion of resources mobilized in 1969 were utilized to meet payments on services account and capital account. Thus the share of merchandise imports in total resource utilization declined further, from 81 per cent in 1968, to 78 per cent in 1969. The share of service payments in total resource utilization increased from 9 per cent in 1968 to 10 per cent, in 1969, while the share of resources devoted to capital amortization also increased from 9 per cent, to 11 per cent over the same period.

The increasing share of service payments and capital amortization in total resource use has implications for policy. This arises from the fact that while captial inflows, which are generally in the form of goods, do tend to augment total resources, yet payments in respect of capital amortization have to be made in foreign exchange. A failure to generate adequate savings in foreign exchange through a surplus in the current account of the balance of payments, will therefore, tend to aggravate the problem of financing services and capital transfers, each year.
