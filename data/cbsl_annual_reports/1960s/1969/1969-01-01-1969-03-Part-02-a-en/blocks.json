In 1969, there was a general increase in all the major categories of industrial production. This was due to two complementary factors which are of equal importance. The first was the availability of raw materials under the FEEC Scheme. The importance of this factor can be appreciated when the import liberalisation under this scheme is compared with the system of import quotas prior to May, 1968, under which industrialists experienced delays and difficulties in getting raw material requirements. The second was the high level of demand for industrial products due to growth of incomes in other sectors of the economy. The impact of the demand for industrial goods was felt on consumer goods industries as well as on capital goods industries which produce constructional materials.",

The rise in trade and transport services was partly due to the increase in the supply of goods from both domestic production and imports. The increased activity in transport was also due, to a rise in the imports of transport equipment. According to the import volume index, the volume of transport equipment has risen from 90 in 1968 (1967 = 100) to 213 in 1969. The value of passenger transport too increased in 1969. This is seen in a rise in the bus mileage of the C. T. B. by 3.8 per cent, passenger mileage of the Railway by 5.5 per cent and internal passenger mileage of Air Ceylon by 6.7 per cent. Expansion in government services, especially health and education services, also contributed to the expansion in the services sector. In addition, banking and insurance services rose in 1969; in 1969, 15 new branch banks were opened by the Ceylonese banks. Total value added in services is estimated to have increased by 14-4 per cent in 1969.",

Rubber production, however, showed an increase of 1.5 percent compared to the rise of 3.8 per cent in 1968. In 1968, prices of all export products had increased sharply as a result of the devaluation of the Ceylon Rupee in November, 1967.

Large increases in output were recorded in chillies, red onions and potatoes. Due to a rise in both output and price, value added in subsidairy crops is estimated to have increased by 48.4 per cent in 1969. The expansion in the output of subsidiary food crops is partly attributable to the incentives provided by the government in the form of guaranteed prices, fertilizer subsidies, credit facilities etc. The maintenance of high open market prices by the restrictions of imports of certain food items was an additional incentive which had encouraged farmers to expand production. Total value added in domestic agriculture is estimated to have increased by 6.7 per cent in 1969.",

As discussed in detail in a subsequent section of the report,-output increases were seen in all the broad categories of industrial production. Public corporations also contributed to the expansion in manufacturing. This is seen mainly in the increase in output by the Cement and Textile Corporations. The substantial expansion in the manufacturing sector for the second year in succession was partly due to the availability of raw materials under the liberalisation of imports under the FEEC Scheme. No less an important factor was the high level of demand for manufactured goods arising from increased incomes generated in other sectors of the economy.",

This increase reflects partly a greater availability of goods due to increased domestic production and imports and partly an increase in prices. The rise in Gross National Expenditure in 1969 was the result of an increase in both consumption and capital formation, the former rising by 14.1 per cent and the latter by 33.8 per cent. The rise in domestic production was due, as discussed in previous pages, to greater economic activity during the year while the rise in imports was the result of liberalisation of imports under the FEEC Scheme.",
