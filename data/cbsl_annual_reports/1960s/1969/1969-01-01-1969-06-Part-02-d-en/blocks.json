    "text": "The money supply declined by Rs. 30.1 million between the end of December 1968 and the end of December 1969. This change was brought about chiefly by the marked contractionary effect of the country's external deficit which was felt almost throughout the year. Expansion of credit by the banking system to the Government and the private sector, however, rose con\u00adsiderably during the year. In several months of the year, domestic credit expan\u00adsion was large enough to offset the contractionary influence of the external sector and to result in modest increases in the money supply. Over the year as a whole, the deterioration in the balance of payments was strong enough to cause a decline in the money supply.",

This figure, compared to the corresponding figure of 6.9 per cent for 1968, may be an indicator of a substantial slackening of expansionary tendencies.",

It is not possible, in the absence of the necessary data, to make anything like an accurate appraisal of demand forces. Some estimate can, however, be made of the direction of change in the demand for money. The increase of 5.7 per cent in the real national product in 1969, for instance, would have resulted in an equivalent increase in the demand for money, assuming no change in income velocity of money. Moreover, the increasing monetisation of the economy would have produced a further increase in the demand for money. Since the money supply did not increase proportionately with the national product, and the average price level actually rose, it may be presumed that the velocity of circulation of money increased appreciably.",

The Government drew down its cash balances by Rs. 71.9 million in 1969 in contrast to an accumulation of Rs. 69.4 million in the previous year. However, the increase in the Government's indebtedness to the banking system was Rs. 74.5 million lower than in 1968. The Central Bank's holdings of government paper increased by Rs. 112.0 million, while provisional advances decreased by Rs. 7.6 million. Thus, the Govern\u00adment's indebtedness to the Central Bank increased by Rs. 104.4 million which was nearly a third of the increase in the previous year. However, in contrast to the decline of Rs. 114.9 million in credit from the commercial banks to the Government in 1968, there was an expansion of Rs. 13.1 million in 1969. The major constituent of this expansion was the increase of Rs. 87.9 million in government import bills, following a decrease in the previous year. There was also an increase of Rs. 8.2 million in short term credit to the Government in the form of cheques etc, purchased on government account. The commercial banks, on the other hand, reduced their investments in treasury bills by Rs. 65.9 million and in government and government guaranteed securities by Rs. 17.1 million. Taking account of the decline of Rs. 46.1 million in other liabilities (net) of the Central Bank, the expansionary effect on the money supply attribu\u00adtable to the government sector was Rs. 235.5 million.",

The increase occurred in the last quarter of the year with the disbursement of credit for the Maha 1969/70 season. It should, however, be noted that this credit is essentially of a short term nature and the increase in the amount outstanding over the two years in which the scheme has been in operation is not due to any increase in the amounts granted over the seasons, but rather to the increasing amounts not repaid. Advances to co-operatives against the purchase of goods receipts in respect of the sale of paddy to the Government under the Guaranteed Price Scheme declined by Rs. 11.6 million. This was the result of a fall in purchases of paddy under the scheme in 1969; the fall was particularly marked in the latter half of the year. Other credit to co-operatives rose by Rs. 16.8 millon.",

Since this expansion occurred in a period of contraction in the money supply, the ratio of time and savings deposits to the money supply climbed rapidly from 42.4 per cent to 51.5 per cent in twelve months. Indeed, it seems quite likely that a part of the increase in time and savings deposits was the result of conversion of idle demand deposits. This process might have been helped by the gradual tightening of monetary measures. The rise in interest rates on time and savings deposits would have acted as a stimulus to shift from idle demand de\u00adposits to time and savings deposits. In October 1969 there were increases of a half to three quarters of a percentage point in these rates following one of a quarter percentage point in May 1968. It is noteworthy that there was no drop in the stability of these deposits. The turnover rate of time deposits in fact decreased marginally from a monthly average of 0.20 in 1968 to 0.19 in 1969; the turnover m e of savings deposits remained unchanged at 0.09.",

The time deposits of financial institutions (mainly provident funds) rose markedly, while those of plantations, trading institutions, manufacturing establishments and other business too increased substantially. Rs. 10 million of the increase in time deposits of trading institutions was in those of government corporations. The contribution of government corporations other than trading corporations to the increase in time deposits was negligible. Time deposits of individuals recorded only an insignificant increase, but the increase in savings deposits was almost entirely in holdings of individuals.",

Although withdrawals from the Post Office Savings Bank were heavier, especially in the second half of the year, than in 1968, fresh deposits during the year increased sufficiently to cause an increase in the balance outstanding at the end of 1969. The Post Office Savings Bank's interest rate on deposits had been lagging behind other deposit rates and was raised from 2.4 per cent to 3 per cent in January 1969. The Ceylon Savings Bank's rate on savings deposits was unchanged, but the rates on fixed deposits were raised by half a percentage point. The rate on savings certificates remained unchanged during the year. There is no doubt that all three savings media had to face severe competition from deposit-taking financial institutions in the",

Trusts, benevolent, pension and provident funds (other than the Employees' Provident Fund) decreased their purchases from Rs. 36.4 million in the previous year to Rs. 26.0 million in 1969.

There was a continuing growth in secondaty liquid assets, but the slight retardation in that growth was in keeping with the decline in the money supply. The overall position, therefore, was one of a mild slackening in the pace of accumulation of financial assets in the form of claims on official and banking institutions. It is possible, however, that the private non-bank sector's holdings of claims within the sector increased on account of the operations of non-bank financial intermediaries. It is indeed very likely that the deceleration in the growth of claims on the Government was, at leas>t in part, the result of competition from such intermediaries in the private sector.",

    "text": "All commercial banks put up their deposit rates in October 1969. The rate paid on savings deposits went up by half a percentage point from 3i per cent to 3\u00a3 per cent. The increases in rates on time deposits varied from a half to three quarters of a percentage point. The rates on deposits for periods up to 24 months were raised by a half percentage point, while the rates on deposits for periods in excess of 36 months were raised by three quarters of a percentage point. The differentials in the rates payable on deposits of varying sizes were also maintained in this general upward movement of deposit rates. Deposits were classified into three categories of size for this purpose, viz., under Rs. 5000/-; Rs. 5000/- and above but under Rs. 25,000; Rs. 25,000 and over. The rates on these classes of deposits were ranged at intervals of a quarter percentage point. Thus, for example, the rate payable for periods in excess of 36 months was 4 J per cent on deposits of under Rs. 5000/-, 4 \u00a3 per cent ondeposits of Rs. 5000/-and over but under Rs. 25,000/- and 5 per cent on deposits of Rs. 25,000/- and over. The last mentioned rate was the highest rate obtainable on time deposits with commercial banks.",

The Bank of Ceylon opened eight new branches, as compared to only one in 1968. These were located at Nattandiya, Dehiwela, Kuliyapitya, Chunnakam, Horana, Maharagama, Tangalla and Eheliyagoda. Six new branch offices were opened by the People's Bank in Narammala, Nattandiya, Alutgama, Eheliyagoda and the University Campus, Colombo. One of the British banks operating in Ceylon, the Eastern Bank, was converted into a Rupee company with majority Ceylonese ownership and started functioning under the new name of the Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd from November, 1969.",

This increase occurred predominantly in bank branches operating in Colombo; nearly two-thirds of the increase was in deposits with foreign banks. In the case of savings deposits-held mainly by individuals-nearly 90 per cent of the total increase was in deposits with Ceylonese banks; a little more than 12 per cent of the increase in the total was accounted for by bank branches in rural areas (defined here as areas other than under municipalities and urban councils). The decrease in demand deposits was almost entirely in urban areas with the major part occurring in deposits with Ceylonese banks. The decline of Rs. 32.1 million in demand deposits with Ceylonese banks was however more than offset by an increase of Rs. 108.8 million in time and savings deposits.",

The monthly average ratio of cash holdings (including statutory reserves) to total deposits declined from 14.1 per cent in 1968 to 13.4 per cent in 1969. This was partly the reflec\u00adtion of the lower reserve requirements owing to the change in the composition of deposits which resulted from a reduction in demand deposits and an increase in time and savings deposits. Among other liquid assets, there were substantial declines in commercial banks' holdings of treasury bills, foreign balances and cash items in process of collection. Although banks' holdings of commercial bills increased as between end-year positions, their monthly average declined over the year. All these developments operated to reduce the monthly average ratio of total liquid assets to total deposits from 38.3 per cent in 1968 to 32.4 percent in 1969.",

    "text": "It would be evident from the discussion of the changes in commercial banks' assets and liabilities that the demand for their resources in 1969 tended to outstrip the growth of deposits and the increase in internal resources. The demand for funds emanating from the private sector was in keeping with a growing trend apparent from 1966. The pressure on banks' resources was relieved by the availability of deposits of this sector, the operation of credit ceilings which limited the increase in the supply of bank credit to the private sector and the availability of refinance facilities from the Central Bank for specified purposes. The Government's demand for commercial banks' resources has been subject to wide annual swings. In 1969, there was a substantial increase in contrast to the sharp decline in the previous year. Taking the entire resource picture into consideration, it will be seen that commercial banks had to resort to increased borrowing from the Central Bank to augment their resources in 1969 in contrast to the previous year when they were able to reduce borrowings.",

This was a reversal of the previous year's position when commercial banks' holdings of government import bills fell by Rs. 125 million. Table II (D) 9 shows Rs. 83.0 million as resources created by the reduction in banks' holdings of government paper. Of this figure, however, Rs. 65.9 million represents the reduction in treasury bills held by banks. Since the holdings of Treasury bills by the Central bank rose by a greater amount during the year, the reduction in commercial banks' holdings of treasury bills could be regarded as equivalent to a creation of resources by the Central Bank for commercial banks. The accretion of commercial banks' resources from the government sector would, on this basis amount to Rs. 17-1 million which represents the reduction in banks' holdings of govenment bonds.",

The decline was especially marked in the first three quarters of the year but there was an increase in the last quarter of the year. Advances to export trading rose by Rs. 18.0 million as compared to Rs. 58,0 million in the previous year. Export bills held by banks rose substantially in the months july-October, but declined in the last two months of the year to reach a level of only Rs. 5.7 million higher than at the end of 1968. The decline towards the end of the year may partly be explained by the increased rediscounting of export bills abroad from October. Advances for wholesale and retail trading rose by Rs. 7.7 million. Other commercial advances increased by Rs. 31.1 million.",

The increase in advances for export crops was smaller than in the previous year. Credit to domestic agriculture increased more than in the pre\u00advious year. The outstanding amount of cultivation loans for paddy and subsi\u00addiary food crops covered by the Agricultural Credit Scheme increased by Rs. 14.7 million. As explained elsewhere, this increase does not represent a gross increase in loans disbursed during the year but an increase in outstanding amounts not repaid from the inception of the scheme.

Proposals for amending the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation Ordinance and for further amending the Ceylon State Mortgage Bank Ordinance with a view to enlarging the scope of activities of these two Government Agencies, were finalised by the Central Bank and submitted to the Government. As a matter of urgency the Central Bank initiated a proposal to amend the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation Ordinance in order to enable that institution to borrow under the refinance scheme. This proposal was given effect to by the Agricul\u00adtural and Industrial Credit Corporation Act No. 5 of 1970. The Central Bank also finalised proposals for amending the People's Bank Act. These proposals are now before the Government.",
