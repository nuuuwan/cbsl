This survey on industrial production covers industrial activity in the cale­ndar year 1969. Data on production, employment and wages were obtained by a postal questionnaire which was issued by the Central Bank on its own for the first time1 and was followed up by personal calls on the industrialists. To make the survey as comprehensive as possible, statistics relating to a few enterprises which did not respond to the Central Bank questionnaire in time but were available at the Ministry of Industries and Fisheries were obtained from their Statistics Branch. The response to the Central Bank survey from the larger units in all categories of industry was almost 100 per cent. Despite the limited time available to obtain the returns and to process the information, more than 85 per cent of all existing new industries have been included in the survey.

In 1968, there was an unprecedented increase in the overall value of industrial production. As stated in the last Annual Report, this was due largely to the increase in prices of manufactured goods following the devaluation of November 1967, and the introduction of the FEEC Scheme in May 1968. As the impact of the price increase in 1968 remained in 1969 as well, a comparison of industrial statistics for 1969 in relation to 1968 gives a more accurate picture of the extent of growth in industry than between the years 1967 and 1968.

Principal Trends

Recent Government policies relating to liberalization of imports of indus­trial raw materials has had a significant impact on industrial production. The total value of industrial output of reporting firms in 1969, as • seen in Table II (B) 1, amounted to Rs. 1,626.8 million, an increase of Rs. 228.2 million or 16.3 per cent over the previous year.

The nine broad categories of industry listed in the above mentioned table show increases in the recorded value of production. Industrial categories which were mainly responsible for this increase are Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment (26 per cent), Chemical, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic pro­ducts (20 per cent), Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries (19 per cent) and Food, beverages and tobacco industries (14 per cent). Fabricated metal pro­ducts, machinery and equipment, and Chemical, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products, which together comprised almost half the total increase in production in 1969, have been the leading and dynamic industrial categories, especially when viewed in the context of the country's agricultural development programme. The increase in production in these two categories which supply a variety of inputs to the agricultural sector, such as trailers, components for equipment, weedicides and fungicides, confirms the view expressed in the Annual Report for 1968, in the section Economic Performance, Problems and Policies that agriculture uses a

1. In previous years the Central Bank and the Ministry of Industries and Fisheries have carried out joint surveys. The response from industrialists has been excellent this year despite the fact that the questionnaire was not issued in the name of the Director of Industrial Development, Ministry of Industries and Fisheries.

large variety of inputs from industry and the higher the degree of modernisation in agriculture, the higher will be the volume and value of inputs originating in industry.

Table II (B) 2 further reveals that the sub-group Machinery (except elec­trical machinery) and transport equipment in the category Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment and the sub-group Miscellaneous chemical products in the category Chemical, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products show significant increases, each contributing 34 and 62 per cent, respectively. Other sub-groups which have shown marked increases in the value of produc­tion are the Beverages and spirits industries from Rs. 34 million to Rs. 77 million, the Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles from Rs. 136 million to Rs. 172 million and Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies from Rs 42 million to Rs. 66 million. Moderate increases in production were observed in the sub-groups Cement, cement products and asbestos products from Rs. 70 million to Rs. 89 million, and Rubber products from Rs. 41 million to Rs. 53 million.

Sub-groups which did not record any appreciable gains in 1969 were Vege­table oils and fats, Biscuits, cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery, Footwear and leather products, Paper and paper products, Petroleum and coal products, Glass and glass products, Bricks and tiles, Fabricated metal products other than machinery and equipment, Wood products, Iron and steel basic industries and Ilmenite. In the case of Preserved and canned fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and other sea foods, Knitted fabrics and articles, made-up garments and other apparel except footwear, Plywood, Industrial chemicals and Ceramics there was hardly any change in the value of production, while there was a decrease in output in Food preparations and Tobacco. A classification of industrial sub-groups according to increase in value of production is at Table II (B) 2 (1).

The number of reporting firms increased from 1,804 in 1968 to 1, 962 in

1969. The 158 additional units in the 1969 survey were mostly very small enter­prises, and their inclusion had very little impact on total industrial production

( 41 )

because their output was relatively low. The change in the number of reporting firms and the value of production in the major industrial categories are summa­rised in Table II (B) 2 (2).

In the category Food, beverages and tobacco, although there was an increase in the number of reporting firms from 588 to 654 and in the recorded value of production from Rs. 609.6 million to Rs. 641.8 million, the sub-group Food preparations fell from Rs. 250 million to Rs. 230.5 million. This was mainly due to the fall in the value of production of desiccated coconut which forms a substantial component of this sub-group. The Beverages and spirits sub-group, on the other hand, increased from Rs. 34.4 million to Rs. 77.4 million. This was primarily due to an increase in the output of arrack and other spirits. In the Textiles category where the number of reporting firms increased by 41 firms, the value of production rose from Rs. 224.3 million to Rs. 267.1 million and was mainly due to an increase in production by one large unit which almost doubled its output in 1969. Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products also had a substantial increase of Rs. 46.5 million. Of this increase, 79 per cent was accounted for by the sub-group Miscellaneous chemical products which includes agricultural chemicals. The sub-group Cement, cement products and asbestos products in the category Non-metallic mineral products except petroleum and coal, contributed as much as two-thirds of the increase in output in this category. The increase in production in Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment of Rs. 59.1 million was primarily confined to the sub-groups Machinery (except electrical) and transport equip­ment and Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies.

Structure and Pattern of Industrialisation

A significant feature (as depicted in Table II (B) 2) is the relative decline

• from 49 per cent in 1965, to 40 per cent in 1969 of the category Food, beverages and tohacco in total industrial production, while over the same period i the value

( 42 )

of production of Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment has doubled from 7 to 14 per cent. This latter trend has also been found in the Chemical, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products.

With regard to individual products in the group Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment an important feature has been the increase in the output of sewing machines, bicycles and various types of electrical appliances. These items which were once luxury goods in the urban households are now looked upon as necessities even in the rural homes, and the market for them has expanded considerably. This could, to some extent, be associated with agricultural development and increased incomes in the agricultural sector.

Consumer resistance to locally manufactured blades, a product included in the sub-group Fabricated metal products, was clearly evident because all the individual firms manufacturing this product had a conspicuous drop in production. The demand for this local product has been falling recently, especially because imported blades of a very high quality, despite the ban on them, are available freely. All the firms manufacturing this commodity have effected drastic cuts in output, one enterprise having cut down production by as much as 70 per cent while the overall decrease in production in this branch of industty was 51 per cent of the total value recorded in 1968.

A classification of industrial production by the major economic categories as given in Table II (B) 3 shows that during 1969 there was little change in the relative shares of the three main categories, consumer goods, intermediate goods and investment goods. However, if data for the period 1965 to 1969 are consi­dered, the shift in production is away from consumer and intermediate goods to investment goods. Over this period the share of consumer goods and intermediate goods in total value of production declined from 53.9 per cent to 51.7 per cent and 37.3 per cent to 31.1 per cent, respectively, while that of invest­ment goods rose from 8.7 to 17.2 per cent. In the consumer goods category significant increases in the value of production were recorded in Food, drink and tobacco, Miscellaneous chemical products arid Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles, while in intermediate goods, the sub-group Miscellaneous food preparations which chiefly comprises vegetable oil and desiccated coconut showed a decrease from Rs. 371.2 million to Rs. 354.2 million. The sub-group Electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances, however, rose from Rs. 41.8 million to Rs 66.3 million. In the category investment goods, sub-groups Cement, cement products and asbestos products and Machinery (except electrical) and transport equipment were responsible for about 93 per cent of the increase of Rs. 55 million.

The Size of the Industrial Unit

The size distribution of industrial units according to the value of output and wage bill is given in Tables II (B) 4 and II (B) 5, respectively. The prepon­derance of small-scale industry is still evident in the consumer goods category where the chief products are processed foodstuffs, made-up garments and handloom textiles. As seen in Table II (B) 4, in the group where value of

output is less than Rs. 250,000, 1,105 units account for only 5.9 per cent of total value of output, while in the group where the value of output is Rs. 2 million and over, 126 firms account for 78.1 per cent of total output. Changes in the structure of industry are evident in a comparison of data pertaining to the years 1968 and 1969. In 1968, while the percentage value of production was 28.1 in the group where output was less than Rs. 250,000 it was 54.7 in the group Rs. 2 million and over. In 1969, however, the corresponding figures were 5.9 per cent and 78.1 per cent, respectively. This clearly shows that production is being concentrated in a few large units. There has not been any change in the value of output in the group Rs. 250,000 and less than Rs. 2 million, the relative shares being 17.2 per cent and 16.0 per cent in 1968 and 1969, respectively.

Data relating to size distribution of firms based on wage bill at Table II (B) 5 shows that small- scale firms predominate where the wage bill is less than Rs. 15,000. In this category, as many as 553 units share only 2.5 per cent of the wage bill, while in large-scale industry 57 units account for 61.2 per cent. The corresponding percentages in 1968 were 3.1 and 62.7 per cenr, respectively.

Not only wages but the concentration of production in a very small num­ber of industrial units is evident in almost all branches of industry listed in Table II (B) 4 (1)- Considering the branches of industry where the public sector does not operate, 8 units in Biscuits and confectionery accounted for 81.2 per cent of output while 5 firms each in the Beverages and the Tobacco industries had outputs of 89.5 and 83.9 per cent, respectively. In the Miscel­laneous chemicals branch. 89.6 per cent of output was accounted for by 2Q units.

Use of Raw Materials

Data on the utilisation of raw materials were furnished by 1,385 firms as against 1,298 in the previous year. Statistics on the use of raw materials both local and foreign are given in Table II (B) 6. A few general inferences could be

drawn from this data. First, the value of raw materials comprises about 50 per cent of the value of production. Second, the share of foreign raw materials is about twice that of the local component. Third, a very high percentage of foreign raw materials is used in the Chemicals (74.1), Basic metals (94.3) and Fabricated metals (78.9) categories which, as already mentioned, have shown substantial increases in production. Except for the Wood and wood products and Food, beverages and tobacco categories, where the percentage share of foreign raw materials was 12.8 and 46.6 per cent, respectively, all the other categories had foreign raw material inputs exceeding 62 per cent of total raw material requirements.

A comparison of data for the years 1968 and 1969 shows little change in the relative shares of utilisation of local and foreign materials. While the local and foreign components of raw materials in 1969 were 34.0 and 66.0 per cent, respectively, the corresponding percentages for the previous year were 35.5 and 64.5. However, there appears to be a marked change in the composition of local and foreign raw material inputs in the Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries, where the local and foreign raw material components are 28.1 and 71.9 per cent in 1969 as compared with 41.7 and 58.3 in the pre­vious year. Similarly, a higher percentage utilisation of foreign raw material inputs is observed in the category Chemical, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products, in 1969 than in 1968.

The conclusion is inescapable that industrial development in Ceylon is very largely dependent on the availability of foreign raw materials. In this connection, recent government measures permitting a free flow of industrial raw materials have been one of the main reasons for rapid progress in the industrial sector. On the other hand, the heavy reliance of industry on foreign raw materials is one of the chief factors responsible for the high cost of locally manufactured goods; it has also constituted a burden on the balance of payments.

Employment

The workforce in the industrial sector, covered by this survey, totalled 103,726 as compared with 101,348 in the previous year. Whilst only a part of the net increase of 2,378 employees could be attributed to the increase in the number of firms which were mostly small units, the balance is accounted for by fluctuations in employment opportunities in the various categories of industry. This is illustrated by the fact that increase in employment was not always accompanied by a corresponding increase in output. In 1969, the output per employee was Rs. 15,648 as compared with Rs. 13,800 in 1968. The total number of man-days increased from 27,462 in 1968 to 28,367 in 1969, while the man-days per employee rose slightly from 271 to 273. The highest number of man-days appear in the Food, beverages and tobacco and Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries.

Wages

The total wage bill of reporting firms increased from Rs. 188.4 million in 1968 to Rs. 199.5 million in 1969. About 25 per cent of total wages is accounted or by the category Food, beverages and tobacco, while the two categories

( 49 )

Textiles, wearing apparel and leather and Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastics together share 63 per cent of the total wage bill. In the two latter categories, although the wage bills were almost the same, the corresponding number of man-days in respect of one was double that of the other. This reflects a considerable disparity in the wage per man-day in these two industrial categories where wages per man-day were Rs. 4.94 and Rs. 9.86.

Power and Fuel

Statistics relating to the use of power and fuel are given in Table II ( B ) 7. The number of firms furnishing data on power and fuel was 555 as compared to 506 in the previous year. Almost 50 per cent of the cost of power and fuel was accounted for by electricity, while the share of petrol and oil was also quite substantial, amounting to about 40 per cent. The cost of electricity, and petrol and oil used for production valued at Rs. 607.4 million was Rs. 9.1 million and Rs. 7.7 million, respectively. The cost of power and fuel per rupee value of output was .031 cts. in 1969 as compared with,.029 cts. in 1968.
