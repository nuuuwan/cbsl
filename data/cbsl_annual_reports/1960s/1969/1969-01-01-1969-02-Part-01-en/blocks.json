Export income declined by Rs. 67 million, import payments increased by Rs. 297 million, the deficit in current invisibles rose by Rs. 61 million and capital payments in\u00adcreased by Rs. 124 million. The resource gap went up from Rs. 649 million in 1968 to Rs. 1,198 million in 1969. Excluding financing through aid and sup\u00adpliers' credits of Rs. 583 million, the resource gap was Rs. 615 million. This had to be met by utilizing reserves and increasing short-term liabilities. The reserves, which were already at a low level, were drawn down by Rs. 86 million. The balance was financed largely by recourse to additional borrowing from foreign commercial banks (Rs. 227 million), I.M.F. drawings (Rs. 77 million), and increasing short-term credits (Rs. 185 million). A noteworthy feature in the financing picture was that, while in 1968 the net resources (i.e. drawings less repurchases) available from the International Monetary Fund totalled Rs. 165 million, in 1969 there was an actual repayment of Rs. 10 million. This change was in part responsible for the large-scale reliance on foreign commercial banks for financing the resource gap.",

The decline in net external banking assets by Rs. 299.6 million was the major factor influencing the money supply. In the domestic field, while the private sector and co-operatives obtained Rs. 33.0 million of net resources from the banking system, Government drew Rs. 189.4 million and Government corporations a further Rs. 85.4 million. Thus, while the external sector was exerting a substantial contractionary effect on the money supply, the impact of the domestic sector-especially Government and Govern\u00adment corporations - was markedly expansionary. The net effect was a fall in money supply by Rs. 30 million on an end-year basis. The average level of money supply in 1969 was, however, higher than in 1968. A noteworthy feature was that fixed and savings deposits in commercial banks went up by Rs. 159.5 million, as compared with Rs. 125.4 million in 1968. The monetary situation was extremely tight in 1969. While the external sector exercised a substantial squeeze on commercial banks' resources, bank lending was also restrained by ceilings on credit expansion imposed by the Central Bank, in pursuance of a tight monetary policy, which was required to prevent the balance of payments situation from deteriorating further.",

The largest increase in revenue was from the sale of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates, which accounted for Rs. 208 million or nearly two third of the increase. The importance of excise duties (especially turnover taxes) was further strengthened during this year as a result of larger turnover of manufactured goods and enhanced duty on tobacco, all of which accounted for Rs. 72 million of the increase. Though there was a fall of nearly Rs. 54 million in import duties there was an increase of Rs. 35 million in export duties mainly due to the satisfactory performance in rubber exports. It is also siEnificant to note that revenue collections from corporate and personal taxes increased by Rs. 26 million, as a result of the higher incomes generated in the private sector and the satisfactory performance by the corporation sector in:the previous year together with the adoption of improved methods to reduce tax evasion and avoidance.

Private savings channelled into financial institutions such as the Post Office Savings Bank, Ceylon Savings Bank, Insurance Corpora\u00adtion and the Employees Provident Fund are diverted to the financing of part of the Government's budget. These are now regarded more as an integral part of resources available rather than as a possible means of bridging the gap. The net contributions made by non-bank investor groups had been declining, thus creating a resource problem to the government. The Insurance Corporation of Ceylon and the savings institutions showed substantial reductions in their con\u00adtributions to government paper in 1968/69. With the availability of better avenues of investments yielding higher rates of return and because of the traditional preference by the private sector for investment in assets that have a high rate of capital appreciation, investment in gilt-edged securities appear to have become relatively less attractive. Even though these institutions are generally considered to be 'captive sources' some of them are also looking for alternative forms of investment to enable them to give their customers better terms and conditions.",

    "text": "The excess of government payments over receipts has resulted more in an increase in cash holdings than in an increase in bank deposits as evidenced by the increase in the currency component of money supply. The banks raised their deposit rates in October, 1969 in order to make deposits relatively more attractive. Since the marketing of government securities is limited and since the banks themselves were faced with a resource problem they reduced their holdings of government securities by Rs. 47 million, in this financial year. The provision of additional finance by banks by purchasing government securities and treasury bills to enable government to meet the residual financing require\u00adment reduces the liquidity of banks. The restraint on bank lending and the demands of the private sector for larger credit facilities make it more difficult to sell larger amounts of government paper to the private sector.",

The most notable developments in this regard were the substantial growth in bank advances for industrial purposes and the decline in advances for import trading.

The extent of commercial bank participation in development finance, however, is bound to be limited in the long run. In fact, commercial banks' loans classified as medium and long term are largely for periods of 3-5 years. Longer term credit for industry has still largely to be obtained from specialised credit institutions whose resources are still limited. The Development Finance Corporation, the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation and the State Mortgage Bank increased their lending in 1969.",

This large deficit in the balance of payments was the result of many factors. Among these were a further deterioration in the terms of trade due to a decline in the export price and a rise in import prices, and the maintenance of a high import demand relative to the rise in national product. In fact, the large balance of payments deficit was also a sign of higher economic activity and higher absorptive capacity of the economy. It might be mentioned that it was partly because the economy was growing that the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments continued to widen.",

In the wake of falling export incomes and rising imports it was necessary to borrow from abroad even at these high rates.

About 23 per cent of imports were intermediate goods which are required to maintain the industrial and agricultural development programmes, while about another 28 per cent were required for development projects. These development projects may be tied to some aid programmes and would not be a drain on our own resources. Thus any curtailment of import demand will have to be applied to consumer goods. Appreciable reductions in imports of consumer goods would result in a fall in the standard of living and a rise in prices, till such time as the domestic sector can increase production adequately. There was, in fact, a decline in the consumption demand for imports. Also, adjustment being made for population increase, imports of consumer goods in per capita terms decreased from Rs. 125 in 1959 to Rs. 96 in 1969. At constant prices, the decrease was even more-from Rs. 124 to Rs. 60. The following table shows the trend of imports in per capita terms.",

In absolute terms, this worked out to about Rs. 300 million in 1969, apart from remittance of profits, dividends, royalties and technical service fees. Because of the poor quality, low durability and high import content of several locally produced goods, the actual expenditure of foreign exchange in some cases was very much in excess of the value of imports of the finished products required to meet the market demand. Complete protection would not lead to the growth of efficiency and the realization of economies of scale through specialization. Exposure of domestic industries to some competition through imports or in competitive foreign markets would help in the creation of a viable industrial sector.",

Although the achievement of these measures consisted only of a restraint on expansion of credit to the private sector, an aspect of banks' credit operations in this sector which may be of concern in the future should be men\u00adtioned here. The slower growth in deposits with banks relative to the growth in advances was referred to earlier. A disparate growth of this nature tends to increase the reliance of commercial banks on resources created by the Central Bank. The Central Bank, however, has to be conscious of the inflationary consequences of such a creation of primary credit which is reflected as an increase in its domestic assets. These inflationary pressures can be relieved if banks accelerate the accumulation of deposits of the public to keep pace with the increase in demand for advances. As the latter is bound to increase rapidly with the increase in activity, the need for greater efforts by banks towards a faster rate of deposit mobilisation becomes crucial to the problem of economic growth with monetary stability.",

As long as cost of borrowing is below the percentage increase in prices (i. e. negative rate of interest) credit restrictions work more effectively by restric\u00adting the availability of credit rather than raising its cost. It was, however, clear that interest rates in Ceylon in the organised money market were unrealisti*. Interest rates levels in major financial centres of the world rose. Banks put up their deposits rates in October of the year. By the end of the year an across the board increase in interest rates was under consideration.*",

There was an increase of industrial production by 16 per cent, construction activity by 29 per cent and non-export agriculture by 7 per cent. The most notable feature was a high level of investment activity both in the private and public sectors resulting in an appreciable increase in production capacity.",
