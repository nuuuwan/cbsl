(C) P U B L I C ENTERPRISES1

In 1969, the total number of industrial corporations increased with the setting up of the Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation, by the transfer of the drug manufacturing section of the National Small Industries Corporation. There was no increase in the number of other public enterprises, in 1969.

Generally, there was a higher level of activity in industrial corporations in 1968/692. The National Milk Board, the Ceylon Oils &. Fats Corporation, the Kantale factory of the Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation, the National Salt Corporation, the State Flour Milling Corporation, the Ceylon Leather Products Corporation, the National Textile Corporation, the Ceylon Plywoods Corporation, the Ceylon Tyre Corporation the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation, the Ceylon Ceramics Corporation, the Ceylon Cement Corporation, the Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation, the National Small Industries Corporation and the Ceylon Steel Corporation recorded increases in their output in 1968/69. Of these, the most noteworthy increase was in the Cement Corporation. On the other hand, the output of the Gal-Oya Sugar factory, the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation, the Paranthan Chemicals Corporation and the State Hardware Corporation showed decreases in 1968/69 over the previous year. The decline at the Paper Mills was on account of a shift in production to low-weight types of paper. In other instances, industrial strife, sales difficulties and non-availability of adequate raw material conttibuted to the fall in performance.

The profits of several industries showed an improvement in 1968/69. The National Milk Board, the Kantale Sugar Factory, the Ceylon Leather Products Corporation, the National Textiles Corporation, the Ceylon Plywoods Corporation, the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation, the Ceylon Tyre Corporation, the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation, the Ceylon Ceramics Corpora­tion, the Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation and the Ceylon Steel Corporation recorded enhanced profits. This was due, inter alia, to improvement in pro­ductivity, increases in prices, greater capacity utilization, and expansion of more remunerative lines of activity. Only the Ceylon State Hardware Corporation in­creased its losses and this was due to sales difficulties and the consequent under-utilization of capacity. Lower aggregrate profits were recorded by the National Salt Corporation, the Ceylon Cement Corporation, the Paranthan Chemicals Corporation and the National Small Industries Corporation. This was due to higher import costs of raw materials (e.g. clinker for the Cement grinding plant), reduced output and higher wage costs. The Gal Oya Sugar industry was able to reduce its losses on account of a higher profit from spirits.

1- The analysis of public enterprises which was expaned in the last year's Annual Report, has been further improved this year by widening of the coverage and presentation of additional data. This analysis is based on quarterly and annual surveys conducted by the Central Bank. At the request of certain Corporations which face active competition from the private sector certnin detailed information h?s been withheld from publication. Also, the various public 1enterprises have been re-c'assified according to the International Standard Industrial Classification (United Nations: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, New York, 1968.)

I- Most industrial Corportaions have accounting years extending from April to March,

( 51 )

1 As mentioned last year, it should be noted that financial profits or losses should be used with utmost caution in evaluating the efficiency or inefficiency of any public enterprise. This is mainly because they are not entriely free to fix prices and also because they are often required to perform un-economic social obligations, which are not likely to be borne by private commercial firms.

Of the other public enterprises, there was a general overall improvement in physical performance in 1968/69 or 1969, except perhaps in the Air Ceylon, the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment and the National Lotteries Board. The Railway and the Ceylon Transport Board recorded enhanced financial losses in the year under review, in spite of an increase in output. Enhanced wage payments were a contributory factor.

A notable feature in the current accounting year 1969/70 or 1970 is that in most enterprises, the actual performance observed so far seems to fall considerably short of the anticipated budgeted performance. It is no doubt encouraging to see that most public enterprises prepare comprehensive budgets in advance. The apparent shortfall may be due to cuts made In their budgets on account of foreign exchange difficulties. It was also due to fairly optimistic expectations.

It was also observed that statistical and accounting services in many Cor­porations were far from satisfactory. This may be due to the difficulties experienced in recruiting competent personnel on the relatively low salary scales offered. In certain cases of very large enterprises, no reliable data could be obtained at all.

Employment in these public enterprises have shown a rapid increase in

the last few years. In certain cases, the increase was much greater than the

increase in the enterprise's activity. It appears that many enterprises could

save much needless expenditure by a more effective utilizarion of already

available man-power.

Among the public sector enterprises in this category were the National Milk Board (with diverse functions in milk marketing and production), the Ceylon Oils & Fats Corporation (whose main activity was the produc­tion of animal feeds), the Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation (which made sugar and alcoholic spirits), the National Salt Corporation (which was a salt manufacturing

• and trading organization) and the State Flour Milling Corporation (which made

wheat flour and by-products). While the first two faced competition from the

private sector, the rest were largely state monopolies. Certain data on their operations in recent years are given in Table II (C) 1.

(a) National Milk Board

In its original function of milk purchasing, processing and distribution, the Board has made steady progress, especially in the last two years 1968 and 1969. Largely due to an increasing turnover and a diversification of its activities, the Board is likely to end its series of losses in past years with a profit in 1969.

The Board has, of late, diversified its activities by manufacturing condensed milk and re-packing bulk-imported powdered milk. The Condensery increased its production substantially in 1969, although it worked below capacity. The resulting enhanced profit accounted for three fourths of the aggregate profit of the Board. The Powdered Milk Packing factory at Welisara which commenced in October, 1969 packed about 2.3 million tins (of one pound equivalent) in 1969, and made a moderate profit. In sum, the National Milk Board appears to have just emerged as an economically viable enterprise.

The Milk Board intends to further expand and diversify its activities in the future. The Welisara Packing Plant was only the first stage of its Powdered Milk project. It has already commenced work on the second stage, namely, the milk spray-drying factory at Ambewela. Estimated to cost Rs. 20 million, this factory will finally have a capacity of spray-drying 200,000 pints of milk per day, which will meet the total of Ceylon's requirements of full cream milk powder. The factory will commence production (on a smaller scale, initially) in early 1971. The Board also has plans to extend its network of processing and collecting centres.

(b) Ceylon Oils & Fats Corporation

The output of all products except coconut oil recorded increases in

1968/69. Notable increases were observed in the production of animal feeds and fatty acids. The Corporation's budget for 1969/70 anticipated decreases in the exportable products of fatty acids and glycerine. Meanwhile, its major activity — the production of animal feed and the output of coconut oil was expected to be higher. The production trends in the first nine months of the year, however, indicate shortfalls in respect of all products. This was mainly due to breakdowns in machinery and shortage of raw materials and in the case of exportable products, on account of non-availability of packaging.

On an improved performance, the Corporation made a small profit in 1968/69. The budgeted performance in 1969/70 was to be even better. Nevertheless, the Corporation anticipated a loss, owing partly to heavy maintenance and repair expenses of its old machinery and mainly, due to the exclusion of a government subsidy from its budget. From 1965/66 (except in 1966/67), the government has annually voted a subsidy to the Corporation to meet the latter's losses on the sale of animal feeds at prices below cost of production on a government directive. Inclusion of this subsidy in the final accounts enabled the Corporation to show

( 55 )

a profit in those years. This practice was not adopted in 1969/70, and the result was a budgeted loss. On the basis of actual performance observed so far, it is likely that the loss of the Corporation will be higher in 1969/70.

Preliminary work was undertaken on the New Provender Mill of the Corporation. It is expected to be in production in about two years time.

(c) Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation

There is a high variability in the production of this Corporation as the sugar cane growing depends on the weather (or availability of water.) With a good harvest the Corporation's factories will be able to work during about six months of the year. At the Kantale factory, the output of sugar and spirits was higher in 1968/69, but at the Gal-Oya factory, the output of sugar was lower although the production of spirits was higher. Thus, higher sales of Kantale enabled the factory to reduce its losses on sugar and to double its profit from spirits, resulting in a four-fold increase in the overall profit. At Gal Oya, the fall in sales enhanced its losses on sugar, but on account of an increased profit on spirits, the overall loss was lower than in the previous year.

On the basis of anticipated increases in production1 and sales, the Kantale factory expects to enhance its profit and the Gal Oya factory, to reduce its losses in 1969/70. On latest available figures, the Kantale factory appears to have exceeded its targets and therefore, the profit might be higher. No such inform­ation was available on the Gal Oya factory.

From its inception the state owned sugar industry of Ceylon has been beset with misfortunes owing to faulty planning and problems of organization. The highly remunerative production of spirits, however, might establish its economic viability in the long run. Hence, it may yet be premature to draw conclusions about this industry's future on the financial results of sugar production alone.

(d) National Salt Corporation

This Corporation produces salt at 6 salterns and purchases salt from 7 private salterns. Generally, there is a high seasonality in salt harvesting and the weather has an important effect on output. 1968/69 was an exeptionally good year and the Corporation was able to produce and purchase a record

99,932 tons, of salt. Sales, however, were almost static but the profit was slightly lower largely on account of higher wage costs.

In 1969/70, the Corporation has budgeted for a lower output, largely because of the unsold stocks of the previous year. Sales, however, are expected to increase, and the Corporation anticipates a moderate increase in its profit.

1 The unusually high output of spirits at Kantale iii 1968/69 was in excess of its rated capacity of 600,000 proof gallons. In view of the high profitability of spirit manufacture, the factory was overstrained to produce this output-

The Corporation is continuously engaged in improving the existing salterns. A major scheme under-way is at the Elephant Pass saltern where it is hoped to increase the output from 34000 to 66000 tons per annum. It con­tinued with preliminary investigations on the large mechanized saltern project at Chavakachcheri1. It appears that the economic viability of this heavy labour-saving project should be carefully examined, in the context of the over­all demand for salt.

(e) State Flour Milling Corporation

The Flour Mill was commissioned at the end of 1968. The production budgeted for 1969/70 was below its maximum capacity. Also, on account of high import-cost of wheat, the Corporation expects to incur a loss in its first full year of operation.

Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather Industries

There were two state enteprises in this field, namely, the Ceylon Leather Products Corporation and the National Textile Corporation. Both faced stift competition from well-established firms in the private sector. Certain details of their operations are given at Table 11(C)2.

(a) Ceylon Leather Products Corporation

This Corporation tans leather and makes footwear. Its production of leather and footwear was higher in 1968/69, but its sales were below the prev­ious year's level, owing to strong competition from the private sector. It's sale-value, however, was higher on account of price revisions after the devaluation of the the Rupee and the introduction of the FEEC Scheme. Wage increases tended to increase costs. Yet, the profit in 1968/69 was higher. In 1968/69 the Corporation exported 3500 pairs of slippers and 7953 lbs. of leather. This was lower than the previous year's exports of 20,000 pairs of shoes and 17,386 lbs. of leather.

In 1969/70, the Corporation expects to more than double its profit on a higher level of production and turnover. Trends in the first 3 quarters indicate that the production is likely to be higher than in the previous year. Its sale of shoes is not doing as well, although the sale of leather shows an improvement.

The Corporation made rapid progress on the new Tannery with a capacity of 1.3 million sq. ft. of chrome leather and 0.4 million lbs. of bark leather. It is expected to be ready in early 1970.

(b) National Textile Corporation

This Corporation operates the textile factory at Veyangoda and also engages itself in import and sale of yarn. The production in 1968/69 was somewhat higher than in the previous year, but the factory continued to operate well below capa­city due mainly to a shortage of trained personnel. However, on account of higher output and sales income, the factory made a profit of Rs. 2.7 million.

1 For details, please see Annual Report 1968, p. 92.

( 59 )

In 1969/70, the Corporation expects to enhance its profits substantially on a higher level of production and sales. Current trends) however, leave little room for optimism on this account. Production is proceeding much below targets, especially in the case of textiles. Higher yarn sales were the only redeeming feature. Hence, the Corporation might have to content itself with a lower profit.

It is interesting to note that the turnover of Corporation's yarn imports is much higher than the turnover of its manufactures. This rapidly grow­ing trading activity resulted in losses until 1967/68 and later figures were unobtainable.

Meanwhile, the Corporation made rapid progress on the establishment of its Textile Mill at Thulhiriya. Originally estimated to cost Rs. 193 million (the costs have risen since then), this factory when completed by end of 1970, is capable of producing 17.4 million lbs. of yarn and 14 million yards of fabric, and finishing 40 million yards of textiles.

Wood and Wood products

Two public corporations compete with a large number of private firms in this field. Of these, the Ceylon Plywood Corporation (one of the oldest public enterprises in Ceylon) enjoys a monopoly of plywood production (especially of tea chests), but it faces competition from several other firms in production of other wood products such as doors, tables and other furniture items. In the field of furniture manufacturing, the Corporation had also to contend with Carpentary Section of the National Small Industries Corporation1, details of which are given in Table II (C)6. The other state corporation in this field is the more recently established2 State Timber Corporation, which took over the commercial activities of the Government Forest Department. In terms of turnover, this is the larger corporation of the two. It faces competition from several timber producing firms in the private sector. Certain relevant data on these two corporations are given in Table II (C) 3.

(a) Ceylon Plywood Corporation.

The budgeted production of the Corporation in 1969/70 at 26 million sq.ft. of 3-ply plywood is 14 per cent higher than the output of the previous year and reflects a continuance of an increasing production trend in recent years. The Corporation's Gintota Factory yet works below capacity owing to irregula­rity of timber supplies. Moreover, the production trends in the first 3 quarters of 1969/70 seem to indicate that the factory might not be able to fulfil its production target. This is largely due to a strike in late 1969.

1. This Corporation has been classified under "Non-Metallic mineral products" because its major activity now is the manufacture of tiles and bricks. 2. Established on April 2, 1968.

Although the Corporation's main activity was the production of tea chests, it has successfully diversified its production by branching out in to highly remu­nerative manufacture of veneers and certain items of furniture. Inspite of this, if the overall production is lower than anticipated, the profit of the Corporation in 1969/70 is likely to be lower than the budgeted Rs. 2 million. Incidentally, the Corporation has so far exported about 135,000 cubic metres of plywood boards and a small quantity of veneer.

Meanwhile, the Corporation also concentrated on its intergrated wood manufacturing complex at Avissawella which was estimated to cost Rs. 67 million1. The construction work of the Chipboard factory was completed and installation of machinery commenced in late 1969.

(b) State Timber Corporation

This Corporation established in April, 1968 completed the take-over of the commercial functions of the Government's Forest Department by early 1969. The functions of the Corporation include extraction, sawing and, sale of timber and construction of roads and the establishment of mechanised units to facilitate timber extraction. An island wide organization decentralized into seven regions2 has been established. The annual demand for timber in Ceylon is estimated at 12 million cubic feet, and the Corporation intends not only to meet almost the entire demand byl972, but to export high-value timber such as ebony and satin wood.

Although the production of timber by the Corporation is expected to reach the full 6 million cubic feet level in 1969/70, it is yet about half of the country's requirements. Due to the severe curtailment of imports, the Corpo­ration had to ration its sales to genuine builders. In view of the relatively low selling prices, however, the Corporation is expected to make a small profit in 1969/70.

The Corporation has plans for systematic exploitation of forests in Ceylon. Initially, it expects to exploit the areas coming under the Mahaveli Project. It also hopes to set up six mechanized logging units, a road construction and building unit and a few saw mills and an impregnation plant.

Paper and Paper products, Printing and Publishing.

Two public corporations - the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation and the State Printing Corporation, and the Government Department of Printing (which managed the Government Press) operates in this field. Of these, the recently established State Printing Corporation3 has not yet commenced production. While the printing enterprises faced competition from the private sector, the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation enjoyed a monoply of paper pro­duction and of imports as well (except certain direct user imports). Salient features of the operation of these enterprises (except the Department of Printing) are given in Table II ( C ) 4.

(a) The Eastern Paper Mills Corporation

The production of the Paper Factory at Valachchenai which declined in 1968/69 due to a change in type of paper produced1 is expected to be higher in 1969/70, although that is yet below its 1967/68 level. Meanwhile, the Corpor­ation hopes to clear its backlog of unsold writing and printing paper. In 1968/69, there was a record increase in its sales due to a revival of demand. Thus, there was a four-fold increase in the Corporation's manufacturing profits in that year. In 1969/70, on the basis of a lower sales estimate, the profit is expected to resume its former levels.

This Corporation is also a trader in imported paper. Its paper imports have been declining since 1966/67 due to import curtailments and its own surplus stocks. Its trading profits too, therefore, have been declining. The Cor­poration also makes and sells exercise books, made out of its manufactured paper and paper bags, made out of imported kraft paper mainly for the local cement industry.

The Capital Programme of the Corporation was centred on the Paper Board Mill which was being constructed at Valachchenai. This Mill with an.annual capacity of 12,000 tons is expected to be in production in 1971. Along with its plans for two new Paper Mills at Embilipitiya and Rajangane, the Corporation hopes to meet a large share of island's requirements. \

(b) State Printing Corporation

This Corporation was set up primarily to cater to the growing printing requirements of the Government (particularly of school text-books), which could not be adequately met by the existing Government Printing Press. It ac­quired 50 acres in Panagoda for its printing establishment and certain machinery ordered by the Government printer have been taken over. The original plans of the Corporation had to be revised due to certain deficiencies, and some progress has been made since then. The Corporation expects to commence production of school text books with available machinery in mid 1970.

Chemicals Petroleum, Rubber and Plastic Products

There are six public enterprises in this field, the Paranthan Chemicals Corporation manufacturing caustic soda, chlorine and table salt, the Ceylon Tyre Corporation making tyres, tubes and flaps, the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation importing, mixing and issuing fertilizer, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation's Oil Refinery making petroleum products, and the Ceylon Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation, which took-over the drug-maufacturing unit of the National Small Industries Corporation. The State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation has not yet commenced production. The Chemicals, Tyre and Oil Manufactories were monopolies,' while others face some competition. Detailed information on the working of these enterprises is given at Table 11(C) 5.

(a) Paranthan Chemicals Corporation

Although an all-round increase in production was anticipated, there was was actually a slight fall in the production of caustic soda and chlorine in 1968/69. This was due largely to the difficulties of selling surplus chlorine and the interruptions in the working of old equipment. The production of table salt (a by-product), however, rose appreciably and in 1969/70, it is expected to rise further. In 1969/70, the production of caustic soda and chlorine is estimated to be higher. Also, a production of 20 tons of potassium chlorate by the new plant is anticipated. On the basis of production trends observed so far this year, however, it is very unlikely that these production targets could be maintained, except perhaps in the case of chlorine.

As mentioned in previous year's Annual Reports1 the production of chlorine continued to be a constraint on the activities of the Corporation. In was not possible to increase caustic soda production to meet the country's demand because in the process, the Corporation will be left with a large quantity of unsaleable chlorine, a by-product. Hence the Corporation engaged itself in a profitable trading activity in the import and sale of caustic soda. As in the past years, the profit from this activity helped to offset the continuing manufacturing losses.

In fact, the Corporation in recent years has been financing a moderate capital maintenance programme out of its meagre trading profits. But in the not too distant future, it will have to incur heavy capital investment in replacing its 20-year old machinery. Of its minor projects, the Potassium Chlorate plant is expected to be in production in 1969/70, but there is some uncertainty over the Hydrochloric acid plant.

(b) Ceylon Tyre Corporation

In 1968/69, the production of tyres was marginally higher than in the previous year, but the output of tubes and flaps declined. The decreases were on account of production being geared to market demand. The slight increase in tyre production was attributed to a policy of gradual increase in capacity-utilization due to complexities of production and the non-availability of certain moulds. Hence, the Corporation limited itself to manufacture of certain sizes of tyres only. In 1969/70, a more than doubling of output has been budgeted. On current trends, however, the Corporation is not likely to fulfil more than half of the budgeted output. The production of tyres and tubes is likely to be about 50 per cent and 30 per cent respectively of targets. There has been, however, an appreciable rise in the production of flaps which was not initially budgeted for. Sales of tyres and tubes however, have been faring better so far in 1969/70 than in the previous year, on account of the import ban.

On the higher turnover in 1968/69, the Corporation enhanced its profits considerably. Furthermore, on the basis of an ambitious budget it hopes to more than treble its profit in 1969/70.

1 • Annual Report 1968 pp. 87 - 88.

( 67 )

The non-availability of sufficient tyre-moulds (sometimes due to delays in arrival) has been the main factor responsible for the low capacity utilization of the factory. In 1970, the Corporation hopes to have sufficient moulds and also to branch out into manufacture of other rubber products.

(c) Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation

Imports of fertilizer by the Corporation showed a record increase in 1968/69 although its sales (and issues) were 27 per cent lower than the quantity imported. Nevertheless its absolute volume of sales in 1968/69 was higher than in the previous year. On the higher turnover and on account of a price increase, the profit of the Corporation in 1968/69 was more than twice its profit in the previous year. In 1969/70, however, a decline is anticipated in its profit mainly on account of an expected increase in world prices of fertilizer compounds.

Along with the unsold stocks of (and lower imports in) 1968/69, the Corporation expects a record 50 per cent increase in its sales in 1969/70, owing to the agriculture development programmes; but-on the trends of the first three quarters of the year, the Corporation is not likely to increase its sales by more than 10 per cent. The trading profits of the Corporation, therefore, are likely to be much lower than what has been budgeted for.

The Corporation made some progress with its Fertilizer Mixing project at Hunupitiya. With a revised capacity of mixing 25,000 tons per annum, this plant is expected to be ready in late 1970. Meanwhile, the Corporation made good progress on the construction of District Fertilizer Stores. By 1968/69, it had set up 46 such stores with a capacity of 88,134 tons. In 1969/70, it hopes to increase this capacity by 20,000 tons.

(d) Ceylon State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation

This Corporation which was to set up a Urea-factory of 285,000 tons per annum based on the petro-chemical by-products of the Refinery, has been engaged so far in preliminary work, such as the acquisition of 140 acres at Sapugaskanda and the planning of the project. Now that the Refinery has commenced production, it is expected to initiate construction by the end of 1970,and complete the work by 1973.

(e) The Oil Refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

The construction of the Oil Refinery with a refining capacity of about 38,000 U. S. barrels of crude oil per day into 1.9 million metric tons of oil products per annum1 was started in May, 1967 and completed in early 1969. The capital cost of the project so far has been about Rs. 190 million. A five year contract was signed with the Consolidated Petroleum Co. Ltd., London for the supply of crude oil, the operation of the Refinery, the supply of technical servi­ces and the sale of surplus products Naptha, Fuel oil and bunkers. Commercial

1. When the consumption of oil by the Refinery is allowed, the balance available is about 1-7 min. metric tons.

production commenced in September, 1969 and in 1970 almost the entire petroleum requirements of Ceylon are to be made at the Refinery and sold to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation for sale1 The Refinery also exported about 6 million gallons of Naptha and about 3 million gallons of bunkers for a total value of about Rs. 2 million in 1969. In 1970, it has planned to export 43 million gallons of Naptha, 105 million gallons of Fuel oil and 22 million gallons of bunkers, which is expected to earn about Rs. 48 million of foreign exchange.

With the coming on stream of the Refinery, there would be scope for the development of a petro-chemical industry in Ceylon. In many countries, petroleum refining has given an impetus to the growth of industries manufactur­ing fertilizer and other chemical products such as liquid petroleum gas, sulphur, carbon, plastics and synthetic fibres. The Refinery is already exploring manufacturing possibilities of liquid petroleum gas, sulphur and carbon black. Meanwhile, the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation is expected to utilize Naptha in its manufacture.

(f) Ceylon Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation

This Corporation took over the drug manufacturing functions of the National Small Industries Corporation in July, 1969. It is expected to concentrate on manufacture, import and sale of Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani drugs. It will also open district stores for purchase of medicinal herbs, and conduct research.

Non-Metallic Mineral Products (except Petroleum Products)

There were three state monopolies operating in this field, namely, the Ceylon

Ceramics Corporation (manufacturing ceramicware) the Ceylon Cement

Corporation (manufacturing cement) and the Ceylon Mineral Sands Corpo­

ration (manufacturing Ilmenite, Rutile and Zircon). In addition, the National Small Industries Corporation could be included in view of its major activity, viz. the manufacture of bricks and tiles. Only the latter Corporation had to contend with private sector competition. Salient features of the activities of these four Corporations are given at Table II (C) 6.

(a) Ceylon Ceramics Corporation

Generally, there was an all-round increase in the output of all manufacturing units of this Corporation in 1968/69. Although the output is expected to increase further in 1969/70, the latest trends indicate that there might be a shortfall in the budgeted production of crockery and wall tiles at the Piliyandala factory. This is mainly attributable to the employment of recently

recruited and inadequately skilled labour at the factory.

1. For details of the trading activities of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, please see Table II ( C ) 11 and the accompanying account.

( 71 )

The Corporation generally sold most of its products at relatively low prices and hence there were no sales difficulties, except in the case of slow moving sanitary ware. The latter problem was due to the availability of imported products. Meanwhile, the Corporation had to ration the sales of its other low-priced products.

On a higher turnover in 1968/69, the Corporation made a substantially enhanced profit, but in 1969/70, the budgeted profit on an even better turnover shows a fall. This is largely due to a sharp fall in profits of the Piliyandala factory where the wage-bill is expected to rise on account of additional employment.

The Corporation expects to expand its sanitary-ware production and also, to go in for production of Felspar, an important raw material of the ceramic and glass industry. The Felspar deposits in Ceylon are estimated to be so extensive as to permit the Corporation to exploit overseas markets.

(b) Ceylon Cement Corporation

This Corporation, which operated a small cement factory of about 80,000 tons per annum for about 15 years, has more than quadrupled its production capacity during the last 4 years. With the commissioning of the first stage of the Puttalam factory in early 1970, the capacity is expected to increase by another 220,000 tons or by 63 per cent.

With frequent commisssoning of new plants, the output of the Corpora­tion shows a sharply rising trend. According to latest trends, the Corporation is right on target of its budgeted production for 1969/70, but this is due to a higher than budgeted output at its Kankesanthurai factory offsetting a shortfall

at its Galle Grinding Plant. There were no sales difficulties, due to coordination

of imports with domestic production. However, in spite of a higher turnover, the Corporation's profits declined marginally in 1968/69. This was largely due to

a sharp decline in the profitability of the Galle Plant which has to incur a higher cost on its imported clinker after the devaluation of the Rupee and the introduction of the FEEC Scheme. There was also an increase in wage costs. In 1969/70, however, the enhanced production at Kankesanthurai and increased substitution of imported clinker with local clinker at Galle, are expected to yield a much higher profit to the Corporation.

The first stage of the Puttalam Cement Factory is expected to commence operations in March, 1970. The second stage, which will double the output of the first stage (of 220,000 tons) is scheduled for commissioning in mid-1971. At Kankesanthurai, the modernization of the old plant was completed in 1968 and the third Cement Mill was established in early 1970. The combined output of these development programmes in 1972 will be about 790,000 tons, which is expected to meet the entire cement requirements of the country.

( 72 )

(c) Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation

Due to an increase in demand, the Corporation has been able to increase its production of Ilmenite in the last two years. As the newly installed drier would ensure continuous production (uninterrupted by inclement weather), the factory's annual capacity has been raised to 120,000 tons and the Corporation expected to exploit the buoyant demand for Ilmenite, better. The production trends of the first nine months of the year, however, indicate a manufacture at about the same level as in 1968/69. Also, the production of Rutile in 1969/70 though higher than the previous year, might fall short of the budgeted estimate. Meanwhile, the Corporation has so far not made any Zircon.1

On a higher turnover in 1968/69, the Corporation made an enhanced profit. A further increase is anticipated in 1969/70 on the basis of expected higher production and turnover of Ilmenite and on the sale of higher-priced Rutile and Zircon. As no Zircon has been made and as Rutile is moving at about half the anticipated rate, the overall profit in 1969/70 is likely to be lower than the budgeted figure. It should be noted, however, that the Rupee-devaluation and the FEEC Scheme have improved the Rupee-income of the Corporation considerably. With the growing demand for the rare mineral products of the Corporation, it should be able to improve its performance in the future.

(d) National Small Industries Corporation

The Corporation which once produced a great variety of products2 has now come to concentrate on its main line of production, viz. bricks and tiles. At present, its only other activity is the manufacture of furniture at six carpentry workshops. Its Ayurvedic drug factory has been handed over to a new Corporation in July, 1969.

The Corporation's five Brick and Tile factories were capable of producing about 17 million units per annum. The annual production in three years ending 1968/69 has been about 11 million units and the Corporation has made continuous losses on this activity. In 1969/70, the output is expected to be nearly 50 per cent higher than that of previous years. On this level of production, the Corporation hoped to break-even at last. But the first three quarters' pro­duction figures indicate that the Corporation is far behind its target. It appears that the shortfall will be as high as about 40 per cent. Hence, it is very unlikely that losses from this line of production could be reduced in 1969/70, as anticipated.

The income from furniture recorded a decline in 1968/69. Again, the

Corporation anticipated to improve its performance in 1969/70, but in the first nine months of the year, it has not shown much cause for optimism on this

account, either. In sum, although the transfer of unprofitable drug making to

another Corporation will tend to reduce the overall losses, the Corporation

has yet to demonstrate the economic viability of its activities. It should be noted, however, that the Corporation performs its carpentry functions more or less as an "employment subsidy".1

Basic Metal Industries

The only public sector industry in this field was the Ceylon Steel Corpo­ration, wich manufactured Rolled Steel products, Wire products and Steel Stru­ctures for buildings etc. In steel rolling, it enjoyed a monopoly, but faced competion in other lines. It was also a small-scale trader in wire and machine tools. Certain data pertaining to this industry are given at Table II ( O 7.

(a) Ceylon Steel Corporation

The Corporation's output in 1968/69 of rolled sections and wire showed an increase, but its sales of rolled sections fell sharply while its wire products moved faster. As mentioned last year2 this was mainly due to importation of certain rolled sections under Open General Licence after May, 1968. Thus the Corporation which anticipated to quadruple its profits had to be content with only a marginal increase.

In 1969/70, the corporation anticipates a near doubling of its profits on an estimated higher level of production and sales. The actual performance in the first three quarters of 1969/70, however, presents a pessimistic picture. There has been a shortfall in production targets due primarily to intermittent industrial unrest and sales too have been somewhat sluggish, particularly of wire products. As a result, the Corporation has been accumulating substantial stocks of finished products.

It should be noted that the Steel Factory continued to operate well below capacity. This is attributed to a policy of gradual expansion of production on account of technical complexities of production.

Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery & Equipment

The public sector activity in this field includes the Ceylon State Hardware Corporation, the boatyard of the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation, the "Govern­ment Factory" of the former Public Works Department and certain activities of the State Engineering Corporation. Data are only available in respect of the major enterprise, the Hardware Corporation, (which faced stiff competition from several small local hardware manufacturers and from imports) and they are given at Table II (C) 8.

(a) Ceylon State Hardware Corporation

It was mentioned last year3 that the Corporation faced difficulties in disposing of its hardware and other products of its factory owing to import liberalization that accompanied the introduction of the FEEC Scheme. As a

result, the Hardware Factory's production in 1968/69 had to be curtailed (thus operating well below capacity), in order to clear heavy unsold stocks. Thus the Corporation's budgeted profit of Rs 2 million turned into a moderate loss

In 1969/70, with the gradual exhaustion of imported equivalents, the Corporation expects to increase its turnover several-fold, and thus turn the loss of the previous year into a substantial profit. It also expects this profit to be enhanced by the surplus from its other line of activity, namely, the Cast-Iron Foundry, which commenced production in late 1969. The actual performance in the first three quarters of 1969/70, however, indicates that the Corporation has been somewhat over-optimistic. Production has dropped to about three-fourths of previous year's level (which was much lower than that of the preceding year), but sales have shown a tendency to pick up. Nevertheless, the Corporation has so far performed well below its targets, and its sales income is less than one-fourths of what was expected.

The Corporation plans investigations into manufacture of malleable and sponge iron, electrical motors and transformers and welding rods.

O T H E R PUBLIC ENTERPRISES

Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing

Two public corporations could be classified in this category-the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation and the State Plantations Corporation1. Some data on these Corporations are given at Table II (C) 9.

(a) Ceylon Fisheries Corporation

The diverse functions of this Corporation including fishing, purchase of fish, storage and sale of fish, fish-canning, construction of boats, manufacture of fishing-gear and by-products of fish, and the development of fishery harbours.

In 1968/69, the fish-catch was about 50 per cent higher, but the purchases from the market fell by almost half. Thus, although there was an increase in the quantity of wet fish available, the sales were at about the same level as in the previous year. A part of the unsold quantum was converted to by-products, but there appeared to be some waste due to inadequate storage. The reduction in the loss of the Corporation could be attributed largelyto price increases. A limited quantity of fish was canned at the Corporation's cannery at Pesalai, but this has yet to reach the market.

In 1969/70, the Corporation budgeted for an ambitious programme. It is very unlikely that this will be fulfilled owing to constant industrial strife. No data were obtainable in respect of 1969/70.

(b) State Plantations Corporation

In 1957/68, the number of plantations increased to 15 with the inaugura­tion of State plantations at Kondachchi (1000 acres), Mankerni (1000 acres) and Pallekelle (4086 acres). The total acreage of plantations thus increased to

14.734 acres, of which 6,719 acres were planted, showing an increase of 1,206 in the acreage planted. Taken together, the plantations recorded a profit in 1968/69 as compared to an aggregate loss in the previous year. This result was mainly on account of profits from Eadella, Yatawatta, Yellangowry, Geragama, Pelawatta and Habarakada plantations offsetting losses incurred by Nellaoolla, Lachesis, and Yahalatenne plantations. According to provisional data for 1968/69, the aggregate profit on plantations was lower than in the previous year. This was mainly the result of a substantial loss at the Pelawatta and Geragama plantations.

On the other hand, the operation of the 4 tea factories of the Corpora­tion showed a reduced aggregate loss in 1967/68 and according to provisional figures for 1968/69, the previous year's aggregate loss has been converted to a profit.

Transport, Storage and Communication

This field was dominated by several public enterprises. The government department of the Ceylon Govt. Railway had a monopoly of public passenger transport by rail, while the Ceylon Transport Board had a monopoly (other than a few taxi-cabs etc,) of such transport by road. Internal air transport was the monopoly of Air Ceylon Ltd, which competed with other airlines on regional and international flights. The Ports of Ceylon and their operations were managed by several diverse organizations. The Colombo Port Commission owned installations of several harbours and was responsible for the general administration of ports. The Port (Cargo) Corporation had a monopoly of cargo handling in the three major ports. The Customs department was responsible for the revenue-collections at ports and a recently constituted Ports Tally and Protective Services Corporation provided the tallying and security services. Meanwhile the Department of Post and Telecommunications was in charge of the postal, telegraph and telephone services. An ancillary of this department, the Overseas Telecommunications Service operated international telecommunication functions, somewhat independently. Salient features of some of these enterprises are shown in Table II (c) 10.

(a) Ceylon Government Railway

A substantial capital investment was made by the Railway in increasing its vehicle fleet (locomotives and carriages) and in extending the track by 24 miles in 1968/69. The increase in the fleet was in contrast to a decrease in th previous year. There was a Rs. 3 million increase in revenue, which was due to increased passenger receipts which offset a decrease in goods receipts. On the other hand, the payment of "interim allowances" increased the wage-bill substantially. These had their effects on reveune and expenditure, leading to a substantial increase in the working and the overall deficit of rhe Railway in 1968/69. According to Government Budget Estimates for 1969/70, the Railway is expected to do better this year. Total revenue is estimated at Rs. Ill million and total expenditure, Rs. 166 million. As there are several cross-entries in Governments Estimates, these figures are not quite comporable with figures of Table II (C) 10.

( 79 )

(b) Ceylon Transport Board

The Transport Board invested Rs. 94 million in 1968/69. This was largely on account of vehicles. This helped to narrow the gap between the required number of vehicles and the available effective fleet. An increase in the scheduled mileage and lost mileage however reduced the impact of the additional vehicles. Meanwhile, an increase in passenger-mileage brought about an enhanced revenue, but a bigger increase in expenditure largely on account of higher wage costs, contributed to a near doubling of its overall loss.

In 1969/70, the Board plans to make a bigger investment (Rs. 128 million) and that too, mostly on vehicles. But, a pronounced incresae in scheduled mileage is expected to widen the gap between required and available (and effective) fleet. On the basis of current low fares, and some improvement in services, a sharp increase in passenger-mileage is anticipated. The resulting increase in revenue is expected to reduce the loss in 1969/70.

It should be noted that inspite of rising prices, the bus fares in Ceylon have remained almost unchanged for well over 15 to 20 years.

(c) Air Ceylon Ltd.

The value of Air Ceylon's assets rose sharply in 1968/69 with the purchase of a "Trident" airliner, which was used in the regional services. The number of passengers has been declining slightly since 1965/66, while the cargo tonnage fluctuated. The passenger-mileage has declined since 1966/67, but goods ton-mileage has shown an improvement. The ratio of capacity utilization has shown an improvement on internal and international services, but in the regional services where the new airliner operated, it had fallen sharply. In order to encourage greater utilization of capacity on this service, the government now permits foreign exchange for pilgrimages to Thailand.

The slight increase in revenue of the airline in 1968/69 was mainly on account of additional revenue on regional services. Expenditure rose more, mainly on account of higher aircraft operation costs. Thus, the profit in

1968/69 is estimated to fall sharply over the previous year.

(d) Colombo Port Commission

The bulk of the work of the Commission was in respect of the Port of Colombo. The increase in revenue in 1968/69 was due partly to an increase in exports and imports, and partly to delays in removal of goods from ware­houses. In 1969/70, a much higher increase in revenue is anticipated mainly on account of FEECs earned and an anticipated higher turnover.

Capital and recurrent expenditure rose in 1968/69 and are expected to rise

further in 1969/70. The former was chiefly due to higher costs result­ing from the recent exchange reforms, and the latter, on account of wage increases. Hence the current surplus of the Commission which ropped sharplyd

(e) Port (Cargo) Corporation

The cargo handled by the corporation rose appreciably in 1968/69. This was due to increases at Colombo and Trincomalee, offset slightly by a decrease at Galle. The revenue of the corporation recorded a bigger increase, mainly on account of a 25 per cent increase in most charges and a 15 per cent increase in other charges. Thus, the corporation was able to end a series of continuous losses by recording a small profit. According to the Corporation's 1969/70 budget, it expects an increase in its profit by Rs. 3 million. This is mainly owing to an estimated additional income of Rs. 19 million on FEECs to be earned by the Corporation.

(f) Port Tally and Protective Services Corporation

Before August, 1967 the functions of tallying and watching cargo in the ports were performed by various contractors on behalf of shippers, in addition to the tallying and security services performed by the Port (Cargo) Corporation. There was considerable unrest, however, among the private tally and watching firms, due to uncertainty of employment. After several experimental solutions were tried and were found inadequate to prevent dislocation of cargo handling, the Government entrusted these functions to the above Corporation from August 1, 1967. The initial capital of the Corporation is Rs. 1 million, and at the end of 1968/69, the total employment was 791.

In 1968/69, the income of the Corporation (at Rs. 7.5 million) was higher owing mainly to a fair increase from tally services. Expenditure too rose mainly on account of higher wage and overtime payments; but on account of the higher increment in income, the Corporation more than doubled its profits (to Rs. 0.8 million). In 1969/70, the Corporation anticipates a fall in revenue, a further increase in expenses, and the estimated profit has decreased to Rs. 0.2 million.

(g) Postal & Telecommunication Services

The increase in the capital expenditure was mainly on the development

of the telephone system (The Outer Colombo Area Development Scheme). The expenditure on postal services increased in 1967/68 chiefly on account of wage increases, but the increase in income was such that a sharp increase W E S

recorded in the surplus. In the case of Telegraph services, the higher increase in income set off a smaller increase in expenditure and the overall loss has been reduced appreciably. The Telephone income in 1967/68 rose only marginally and a sharp increase in costs due largely to wage increases, converted the previous

year's profit of Rs. 1.9 million to a loss of Rs. 1.6 million. With the subse­quent increase in the telephone tariff, the service is expected to reverse this trend in future years.

( 84 )

Thus, the commercial accounts of the above-mentioned major activities of the Postal Department reflect an overall loss in 1967/68 of the same magnitude as in the previous year.

Wholesale and Retail Trade

There were two public corporations predominently engaged in trading activity. They were the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment which concentrated on the import, purchase and sale of food and groceries, cement, hardware and ether household requisites, and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, which took-over the nationalized trading business of private oil companies. The latter enjoyed a monopoly while the former exercised the sole right of importing certain items. Certain details of these two institutions are given at Table II (C) 11.

(a) Co-operative Wholesale Establishment

The growth of this organization and the subsequent transfer of some of its activities to other institutions was described last year.1 The drop in sales in 1968 was mainly on account of decline in trading in Textiles, Tyres and Tubes, Stationary, and Provisions. Hence, the C.W.E. recorded a lower profit in 1968.

Final data in respect of 1969 are not available. According to its budget, however, a sharp decline in turnover is anticipated. This is mainly on account of the transfer of its sugar trading activity to the Food Commssioner. Thus, inspite of an anticipated higher turnover in cement and provisions, the budgeted profit for 1969 is less than one-third of its profit in the previous year.

(b) Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

Towards the end of 1969, the Corporation shifted from the import of refined petroleum products to purchase from its own Refinery and the Lubricant Blending Plant. Generally the purchases (imports plus local purchases) and sales in 1969 were higher than in the previous year. This was reflected in the higher revenue figure for 1969. The increase in the cost of purchases, however, was much lower in 1969 than the corresponding increase in the previous year. This was inspite of the impact of the Rupee devaluation and could be attributed to a shift to cheaper sources in the Asian region in that year. Thus, the Corpo­ration was able to record a higher profit in 1969.

In 1970, the Corporation has budgeted for a smaller profit. This was on account of an anticipated higher cost of purchases and distribution expenses, off-setting an enhanced receipt from sales.

Construction

Among the public enterprises that could be included in this category, the major construction agency was the State Engineering Corporation. There was also a "Heavy Construction Division" of the River Valleys Development Board

1 Annual Report, 1968. p, 114.

( 85 )

which was engaged in similar activity. In volume of work, however, the Government Department of Buildings was not far behind the Engineering Corporation. Certain data on the Engineering Corporation are given at Table II ( C ) 12.

(a) State Engineering Corporation

The expansion of this Corporation from a small-scale construction firm to a large concern, undertaking large and complex construction projects has been a notable feature. The Corporation undertook Rs. 75 million worth of contracts in 1968/69 and the value of contracts outstanding at the end of that year was 233 million. Its income in 1968/69 was more than twice that of the previous year. Nevertheless, its declared profits have been relativaly low throughout, due probably to a policy of keeping small margins on its construction projects. The last published audited accounts of the corporation were in repect of accounting year 1964/65.

( 86 )

Electricity, Gas and Water

Among the enterprises that operated in this field, the major one was the Ceylon Electricity Board. The others were the Water Supply, Drainage and Local Government Works Division of the Ministry of Local Government, the River Valleys Development Board and the Water Resources Board. Also engaged in development of water resources for agricultural purposes was the government's Irrigation Department. Certain details of a few of these enter­prises are given at Table II ( C ) 13.

(a) Ceylon Electricity Board

The former "Department of Government Electrical Undertakings" which managed the major portion of the Electric Power Supply System in Ceylon1

was converted to a public corporation on November 1, 1969.2

The Board's capital investment in 1968/69 of Rs. 92 million was the highest

for a single year. This was largely invested on the stage one of the Maskeli-Oya

Project. The installed capacity of the system was raised by 81 megawatts in

1968/69. This was the result of the commissioning of the new Polpitiya Power Station of 75 megawatts in April, 1969 and of the Walawe Power Station of 6 megawatts in February, 1969.

With additional capacity, the Board was able to increase its power-generation by about 20 per cent in 1968/69. The plant utilization (load) factor, however, recorded a sharp fall (to 30 per cent). This was partly because the newly commissioned units operated for only a part of the year 1968/69. It was also due to a drought which affected the supply of water. The sale of power, however, showed a smaller increase when compared to the increase in generation owing to a sharp increase in transmission losses. Of the increment in power sold, more than half was accounted for by industries, reflecting the growth and expansion of industries in Ceylon.

The expenditure rose in 1968/69, largely on account of higher generarion costs and interest and annuity charges on loans. Nevertheless, on a higher turn­over, the Board recorded a moderate increase in its profir. It is also noteworthy that the employment in this industry has been rising very slowly, inspite of a substantial increase in output. Progressively better utilization of man-power has been a feature of the Board's operation. The Board's future development plans include the Maskeli-Oya Project, Stage II, which is expected to develop 90 megawatts, when completed in 1973. It also plans to expand the thermal capacity at the Grandpass Power Station by 25 megawatts by 1972.

1. Certain industries and local authorities developed and even sold small quantities of electric power under licence from the Department.

(b) Water Supply, Drainage and Local Govt. Works Division

{of the Ministry of Local Government)

The function of water supply for domestic and sometimes industrial uses (a notable public utility function performed by governments ot public corpo­rations in many countries) is handled by the above named Division of the Ministry of Local Government.1 This division, along with various local govern­ment bodies, constructs, maintains and/or operates a considerable number of major and minor water supply schemes. It has a central organization headed by a Director with branches for Designs, Construction, Maintenance, Sewerage and Drainage, Rural Water Supplies and Local Government Works, and a regional island-wide organization.

Inspite of several requests and reminders, data on the operation of this important Division were unobtainable. Whatever is published in Table 2 ( C ) 13 was collected from Government Accounts. The financing of major supply schemes are generally shared by this Division (i. e. the Government) and the benefitting local Government authority. Usually, the Government is the major contributor. Nevertheless, the investment in water supply schemes are relatively low when compared with government investments in most other activities. The government collects a nominal fee from local authorities for the supply of water, and this appears to have no relation to the costs incurred by the Government. In short, water appears to be provided more as a subsidy than being sold as a given product. It should be noted, however, that rates in lieu of water supplies are a useful source of revenue to local authorities.

With the gradual growth of industrial enterprises, predominantly in or around the major cities2, and the pressing need for the extension of public water supplies for drinking, the organizational set up and the lack of commercial attitudes in water supply would appear to need scrutiny.

(b) Water Resouces Board

This Board's functions were mainly advisory. It was to appraise the Minister on control, development, conservation and utilization of water resources of Ceylon. In this context it was expected to concentrate on irrigation, drainage, flood control, power-development and afforestation schemes, and on proposals for control of soil erosion, pollution of water courses etc. In sum, it was to integrate all plans for water-resource development of various authorities.

The Board has devoted its attention to several major water-resource pro­jects, and is currently engaged in preparing a comprehensive plan of develop­ment for the entire country.

Financing, Insurance, Real Estate & Business Services

This category included the Insurance Corporation of Ceylon (which enjoys a monopoly of all insurance business in Ceylon (except marine insurance), the Industrial Estates Corporation (which constructs and leases industrial premises)

1> Until 1966/67, it was the function of the government department of Water Supply, and Drainage in the Ministry of Local Government, but since then, this department and other departments under this Ministry have been amalgamated with the Ministry, as separate •divisions.' 2- In developed countries, industries are the major users of water.

and the Colombo District (Low Lying Areas) Reclamation and Development Board (which was to reclaim water-logged land in the district for development). Certain statistics pertaining to these enterprises are given at Table II ( C ) 14.

(a) Insurance Corporation of Ceylon

An outline of the circumstances that led to the nationalization of insurance-business in Ceylon, the growth of this corporation and provisional figures for 1968 were given in last year's Annual Report.1

Final figures for 1968 are given in the Table and no data for 1969 were available. In 1968, the Corporation considerably improved its performance in Life Assurance and General Accident insurance business. It made marginal progress in Fire and Marine insurance.

(b) Industrial Estates Corporation

This institution continued to lease its industrial premises at Ekala. In 1968/69, 38 of the 43 units were leased out to 31 privately owned industries. Among the manufactures were galvanized metal products, stainless steel utensils, fountain pens, brushes, carbon paper, fishing accessories, paints and varnishes, cosmetics, adhesives, paper and paper products, electrical fittings, toys, agro-chemicals, fruit canning, leather products, motor spares, cookers, ceiling fans and textile printing.

The Corporation's rental income in 1968/69 was higher on account of rent-increases, but its expenditure rose higher and reduced its nominal profit.

Its future plans include the establishment of "Regional Industrial Estates". Initially, it proposes to establish such estates in Kandy (Pallekelle), Galle and Jaffna. After some initial delays, it commenced work on the Pallekelle Estate of 39 factory premises. This is scheduled for completion by the end of 1970.

(c) Colombo District (Low-Lying Areas) Reclamation and Development Board

This board was established in July, 1968 with a view of reclaiming an estimated 2500 acres of low-lying water-logged and hence unused land in the Colombo District. It was expected that the cost of reclamation could be recouped from the sale of reclaimed land. In 1968/69, it was mainly engaged in the preliminary planning of projects, and in 1969/70, it expects to commence reclamation. Initially, it is planned to reclaim 54 acres in Mattakuliya and 17 acres in Borella, in about two years.

Other Services

This category included a miscellaneous group of enterprises ranging from the Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation, the National Lotteries Board, the Coconut Fibre Board, research and propaganda institutions such as the Tea Research Institute, the Rubber Research Institute, the Coconut Research

Institute, the Ceylon Tea Propaganda Board, and the National Council of Higher Education. Data were not available in respect of several institutions, and some statistics are presented in Table II (C) 15.

( a ) Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation

The income of the Corporation was slightly higher in 1968/69 owing chiefly to an improvement in sale of time on the commercial service. Expenditure rose moderately and the overall profit remained at the same level as in the previous year. There was, however, a moderate increase in employment towards the end of the year.

(b) The National Lotteries Board

The Board conducted more lotteries in 1968/69, but its income from sale of sweep-tickets showed a small decrease. It appears that, with more frequent lotteries and the novelty tending to wear-off, the Board will have to adopt novel and eye-catching selling techniques if it is to enhance its income, ptogressively, The administration expenses tended to rise, and as a result, the Board recorded a slightly lower profit in 1968/69.

(c) Coconut Fibre Board

This Board was set up in March, 1968 to meet certain ills of the fibre industry. It was felt that there was a deterioration of this traditional industry, due to low and fluctuating prices which were attributed to poor quality of the product, non-expansion of export markets (due to growth of synthetic substitutes), a glut of intermediaries and the technological backwardness of the industry. Initially, it set floor-prices for fibre products, It also initiated the setting up of a Fibre Mill and an exporting company. It has plans for assisting the modernization of existing factories.
