Summary

Data relating to employment and unemployment in Ceylon which are available on a regular basis, consist of numbers placed in employment by Employment Exchanges and registrants for employment or better employment at the Exchanges; these depict only partially, the current employment situation in the country. To supplement these figures, the Central Bank conducts an annual inquiry into employment in Government Departments and Semi-Government Institutions (Public Corporations, Universities, Boards etc.) The Bank also now collects details of employees registered under the Employees' Provident Fund from the records of its E. P. F. Department. They are based on returns furnished to the Superintendent, E. P. F. by employers in respect of 'covered' employ­ments.1/2 These figures which are classified according to industry and district were available at the time of writing, only up to the year 1967. They are never­theless useful because they do indicate the geographical and industrial distribu­tion of a large segment of employment in the island.

In 1969, the number of persons placed in employment by the Employment Exchanges rose by 7 per cent. This rise consisted of almost entirely unskilled and technical and clerical workers.

According to the annual survey of employment in the public sector con­ducted by the Central Bank, the number of employees rose by 3. 3 per cent, in Government Departments and by 7. 6 per cent in Semi-Government institutions. The growth of employment in the Semi-government institutions was mainly in Petroleum, State Engineering, National Salt and Cement Corporations and in the C. T. B. and River Valleys Development Hoard. In several public Corporations employment increased as a result of greater constructional activity by the Corporations.

According to data collected from the E. P. F. Department of the Bank, the number of employees covered by the E. P. F rose at an annual rate of 7-6 per cent between 1964 and 1967. The largest increases were in agriculture other than

export agriculture3 and manufacturing and services.4 These figures also indica­ted that while workers in Manufacturing Industries were largely concentrated in Colombo, those engaged in Trade, Transport and Services were more evenly distributed in the Island. It should, however, be noted that an increase in the number of persons registered under the E. P. F. is partly due to an increase in employment and partly due to new employments being brought under the

E. P. F. Act and stricter enforcement.

1. "Coveted" employments consist at present of estates which employ 5 or more persons and establishments other than estates which employ 3 or more persons. 2. Thsse figures exclude employees who contribute to approved Provident Funds. 3. Export Agriculture relates to Tea, Rubber and Coconut. 4. Includes, hotels, laundries, barber saloons etc.

The total number of persons placed in employment increased from 4,950 in 1968 to 5,283 in 1969. The percentage increase in 1969 was 7 per cent com­

pared to an increase of 16 per cent in the previous year. The increase in the number placed in 1969 consisted almost entirely of unskilled and technical and clerical workers. They rose by 212 and 185 respectively.

Employment in the Public Sector

Data on employment in Government Departments and Semi-Government Institutions (Public Corporations, Universities, Research Institutes, Boards etc.)

are based on an annual inquiry conducted by the Central Bank. The response to the inquiry in 1969 was better than in 1968. In 1968, 89 government depart­ments and 46 semi-government institutions had responded to the inquiry. In

At the end of 1969, the number of registrants for employment or better

employment with the Employment Exchanges stood at 341,286. About 40 per

cent of this number consisted of un-skilled workers, 25 per cent technical rnd

clerical workers, 26 per cent semi-skilled workers and 9 per cent skilled workers.

Table II (I) 1 below shows annual figures of the number of persons placed

1969, the response increased to 96 government departments and 55 semi-government institutions. The figures for those government departments which did not respond were estimated as far as possible, on the basis of the informa­tion on cadre given in the Estimates of Government Revenue and Expenditure for 1968/69 and 1969/70.

Employment figures are classified according to status, i. e. Permanent, Temporary and Casual and under the following occupational categories:*

(ii) Subordinate employees; (iii) Minor employees; (iv) Others.

The above table shows that both in 1968 and 1969 about 91 per cent of the total number of employees in government departments was in the subordinate and minor grades; subordinate employees accounted for 45 per cent and minor employees for 46 per cent in 1969. The proportion of employees in administrative, technical and professional grades was 4 per cent.

The classification of employees according to status shows that in 1969 about 80 per cent of the total number of employees in government service consisted of permanent employees, about 15 percent casual employees and 7 per cent temporary employees. These percentages for 1969 are roughly the same as for 1968.

The total number of employees in government service increased by 3-3 pet cent in 1969. This increase consisted mainly of minor and subordinate employees of the total increase, the rise in the number of minor employees amounted to 62 per cent and of subordinate employees to 22 per cent. The increase in the administrative, technical and professional officers amounted to only 8 per cent of the total increase.

Semi-Government Institutions

Estimates of employment in Semi - Government institutions are given in Table II (I) 3 below:

Employment Statistics - Semi-government Institutions*

( 212 )

In 1969, minor employees constituted 74 per cent of all employees in semi-government institutions, subordinate employees 13 per cent and administrative technical and professional officers about 4 per cent.

In 1969, the total number of employees in semi-government institutions was higher than in 1968 by 7-6 per cent. The growth of employment in this sector consisted largely of employees in the minor category. The increase in the number of minor employees amounted to 58 per cent of the total increase. About 30 per cent of the increase consisted of subordinate employees and about 5 per cent administrative, technical, and professional employees. In 1969, notable increases in employment were seen in the Petroleum, State Engineering, National Salt and Cement Corporations and in the Ceylon Transport Board and River Valleys Development Board

average growth rates being 18-7, 17-1 and 16 0 percent, respectively In Mining and Quarrying, Construction, Trade and Transport, the average annual growth rate varied between 12-2 and 13-7 per cent, while that in Export Agriculture it was only 6-3 per cent.

Table II (I) 5 shows the distribution of employment according to industry and district at the end of 1967.

At the end of 1967, 19 per cent of the registered employees were in trades situated in the Colombo District, 17 per cent were in Kandy, 11 percent inRatna-pura, 10 per cent both in Nuwara Eliya andBadulla, 7 per cent in Galle and 6 per cent in Kegalle. Employees in the Colombo District were mainly engaged in Manu­facturing, Trade and Transport and Service industries which employed 36 per cent, 32 per cent and 17 per cent respectively of the total number of registered employees in that District. Most of the employees in the other districts mentioned were plantation workers. It is also seen from this table that while workers engaged in Manufacturing industries were largely concentrated in Colombo, workers in Trade and Transport, Construction and other services were more evenly distributed in the island.

Registrants for employment

The number of registrants for employment or better employment, as seen in the table below, was 341,286 at the end of 1969 compared to 276,399 at the end of the previous year. At the end of 1969, the proportion of registrants in the unskilled category was larger and the proportion of technical and clerical registrants, somewhat smaller than at the end of 1968; of the registrants at the end of 1969, 40 per cent consisted of unskilled, 26 per cent semi-skilled, 25 per cent technical and clerical and 9 per cent skilled workers; the percentages in 1968 were 38 per cent unskilled, 26 per cent semi-skilled, 27 per cent technical and clerical and 9 per cent skilled workers.
