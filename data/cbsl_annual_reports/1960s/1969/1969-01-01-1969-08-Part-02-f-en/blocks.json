Total revenue, was also Rs. 159 million more than anticipated, and this curtailed the increase in the Budget deficit to Rs. 85 million. On the financing side, there were shortfalls in domestic market borrowing and foreign finance of Rs. 28 million and Rs. 50 million respectively, which were more than offset from two sources which were not anticipated at Budget-time, viz., administrative borrowing of Rs. 52 million and drawing down of cash balances (including foreign aid counterpart funds) of Rs.

The average rate of annual increase was even higher in the last five years. In that period, revenue rose by 7-4 per cent and expenditure, by 8.7 per cent, per annum, (recurrent expenditure 5.3 per cent, and capital expenditure 5.9 per cent.) It will thus.be observed that on an average, Government expenditure has been rising at a faster rate than Government revenue in the last ten years. However, these averages might conceal a more recent trend where the increase in revenue (in percentage though not in absolute terms) has been higher than the increase in expenditure. In 1968/69, for instance, revenue rose by 15.8 per cent, compared to a 14.6 per cent, increase in expenditure and in 1969/70, the budgeted increases are of the order of 13.5 per cent, for revenue and 10.1 per cent, for expenditure.",

The estimated expansionary impact of fiscal operations in the last five years totalled Rs. 660 million, while the corresponding figure for the preceding five-year period was Rs. 1,000 million. It is evident that expansionary financing in a period of rising Government expenditures in the last five years has been contained at this level by a heavier recource to external resources. This is reflected in the increases in public debt outstanding in the respective periods. In the last five years, the net debt outstanding rose by Rs. 2,803 million, consisting of Rs. 1,839 million of domestic debt and Rs. 964 million of foreign debt. In the preceding five years, the total net debt rose by Rs. 1,911 million, consisting of Rs. 1,738 million of domestic debt and Rs. 174 million of foreign debt.",

    "text": "It was observed in the last year's Annual Report that turnover tax (alonfi with tobacco tax) has emerged as a buoyant source of Government revenue. In fact, receipts from this tax on the turnover of manufacturers and other businesses in 1968/69 were Rs. 32 million higher than in the previous year and Rs. 19 million higher than the original estimate for 1968/69. In 1969/70, it is expected to contribute Rs. 171 million more to Government revenue than in 1968/69. If this is realized, it will account for 9 per cent of total Government revenue, in sharp contrast to the 3 per cent it accounted for, in 1967/68. The improvement in receipts in 1968/69 was due to enhancement of the tax-rate from 5 to 10 per cent in respect of certain manufactures, the inclusion of incomes from profess\u00adions and services under the tax, and the simplifcation of procedures by imposing the tax on the aggregate turnover of each branch of business.1 It was also due to the higher turnover resulting from a higher level of business activity. The further and sharp enhancement of revenue expected in 1969/70 is on account of the lowering of the exemption limit from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 75,000 per annum, changes in the basis of taxation of oil imports from import duties to turnover tax, introduction of certain higher rates and the inclusion of cigarette manufac\u00adturing under the tax.2",

Although the import duty revenue in 1968/69 was Rs. 51 million higher than the Budget estimate for the year (largely because of higher revenue from miscellaneous imports), it was yet Rs. 54 million lower than that of the previous year. This decrease was largely on account of cotton yarn and twist (Rs. 12 million), tobacco (Rs. 9 million), industrial raw materials (Rs. 21 million) and import licence fees (Rs. 64 million), partly offset by increased receipts from transport equipment (Rs. 18 million) and miscellaneous imports (Rs. 30 million). The decrease in revenue from the first two items was partly the result of a decrease in the volume of imports. In the case of cotton yarn and twist it was also due to extra-legal waivers of duty on imports of Salu Sala Ltd.2 On the other hand, the decreases in revenue from industrial raw materials and import licence fees was on account of the virtual abolition of these revenue-sources in 1968 along with the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates Scheme. Meanwhile, the increase in revenue from transport equipment and other miscellaneous imports was consequent on the increase in imports of lorry chassis, car engines and other items under Open General Licence.",

An enhanced increase in the gross food subsidy1 of Rs. 47 million, and higher interest cost of public debt (Rs. 40 million) were the main contributory factors. In 1969/70, however, a smaller increase in transfer payments is anticipated. The budgeted increase of Rs. 84 million includes an increase of Rs. 56 million in public debt interest, and a decrease of Rs. 9 million in the gross food subsidy. In view of the latter decrease, the ratio of the food subsidy to total current payments is expected to decline to 21 per cent.",

The increase in the previous year was due mainly to a sharp rise in the average landed cost of imported rice by 49 per cent to Rs. 976 per long ton, (partly offest by a reduction in the issue of imported rice by 20 per cent to 301,300 tons), and a rise in local rice subsidy due to the higher price paid to producers (again partly offset by a fall in issues by 14 per cent to 204,000 tons), which was slightly compensated by enhanced profits from sugar and flour. In 1968/69, however, subsidy on imported rice was lower by Rs. 16 million on account of a fall in the landed cost of imported rice by 6 per cent to Rs. 921 per long ton and by a reduction in the issue of imported rice to 280,000 tons or by 7 per cent. On the other hand, the subsidy on local rice increased by Rs. 48 million in the year. This was on account of the higher guaranteed price paid to producers and the increase in the issue of local rice to 260,600 tons or by 27 per cent.2 Meanwhile, the distribution expenses and other charges increased by Rs. 21 million. Consequently, net of a decline of Rs. 4 million in the subsidy on locally produced onions and a marginal increase in rice subsidy tax, the total gross subsidy increased",

On the other hand, the increase in the domestic debt liability in the year under review of Rs. 317 million was considerably lower than the record increase of Rs. 614 million in the previous year.

This was due to the changes in the composition of domestic debt mentioned earlier. It will also be seen that in the last few years, there had been a gradual shift in the maturity pattern in favour of securities maturing in the first 5 years and securities maturing in 20 to 25 years, while there had been a relative decline in the share of securities maturing in the period in between. In fact, while about 10 per cent of the domestic debt will be maturing in the next five years, 29 per cent of such debt will mature 20 to 25 years hence. This is largely the result of the policy in the last few years of floating long-term securities. The maturity pattern indicates that there is some scope for spreading the debt repayment burden more evenly by floatation of short and medium term loans.",

    "text": "It will be seen that the resources mobilised by the Government by way of Rupee Loans has been falling since 1966/67 and the sum raised in 1968/69 was lower than the amounts raised in each of the last four financial years. This progressive decline in the flow of funds from domestic sources is mainly on account of a considerable decline in the contributions of the non-bank private sector. The contributions of this sector dropped from Rs. 67 million in 1965/66, to Rs. 63 million in 1966/67, Rs. 41 million in 1967/68 and Rs. 39 million in 1968/69. Meanwhile the bank sector too has progressively reduced its intake of Government securities from Rs. 18 million in 1965/66 to less than Rs. 1 million in 1968/69. On the other hand, the semi-government institutions (comprising the Employees' Provident Fund, sinking funds, long term savings institutions, In\u00adsurance Corporation of Ceylon and Departmental and other official funds) which had been increasing its contributions in the period up to 1967/68 recorded a decrease in 1968/69. This decrease of Rs. 18 million was mainly on account of decreases in the contributions of savings institutions, Insurance Corporation and sinking funds partly offset by an increase in the contributions of the Employees' Provident Fund. Nevertheless, this sector continued, as in the past years to provide the main support for rupee securities floated. This sector, which absorbed nearly 76 per cent of the securities raised in 1965/66 increased its share to 80 per cent in 1966/67 and to 88 per cent in 1967/68 and 1968/69. . Thus the performance of Government loan programmes have come to depend heavily on this sector.",

    "text": "The dwindling support to Government loan programmes from the bank and the non-bank private sector is substantially explainable in terms of the availability of more attractive investment opportunities outside the public sector. This was partly the result of the higher level of private sector economic activity observed in recent years, which has increased the demand for resources by the private sector. This is evidenced by the frequent increases in the last few years in the interest rates payable on savings held with commercial banks and financial intermediaries. It appears that the private sector has emerged as a strong contender with the Government for the available resources. It is also possible that the withdrawal of the exemption from wealth tax of investments in Government Securities had an adverse effect on the private sector. Moreover, the relatively low interest rates paid by semi-government savings institutions placed them in a disadvantageous position vis-a-vis commercial banks and other financial institutions in the competition for savings.",

The increase in the Central Bank holdings was due to purchases of securities by the Bank from the sinking funds and the Post Office Savings Bank. Purchases from the former was to enable the sinking funds to repay maturing Government loans and the purchases from the latter were to enable the Post Office Savings Bank to invest in National Housing Debentures.",

Thus there was a shift in the ownership of Treasury Bills from the non-bank to the bank sector of Rs. 9 million. This was due to the increase in the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury Bills of Rs. 51 million partly offset by a reduction of Rs. 42 million of Treasury Bills held by the commercial banks. It will be observed that in the last 5 financial years, the Central Bank had been progressively increasing its stock of Treasury Bills (from Rs. 1107 million as at the end of 1964/65 to Rs. 1637 million as at the end of 1968/69) whereas the commercial banks have shown a tendency to reduce their stock of Treasury bills (from Rs. 127 million as at the end of 1964/65 to Rs. 54 million as at the end of 1968/69). The decrease in holdings of the non-bank sector was mainly on account of a decrease of Rs. 19 million by sinking funds offset partly by increases in the holdings of insurance companies by Rs. 5 million and \"others\" by Rs. 4 million. Thus, while there has been a shift in ownership from the non-bank to bank sector, there has been a further shift within the bank sector from commercial banks to the Central Bank. Hence, the Central Bank has increased its ownership of Treasury Bills from 91 per cent to 94 per cent of the amount outstanding during the year under review.",

This will lead to a virtual elimination of imports of refined petroleum products in this financial year. In order to obtain the same amount of revenue that would have accrued if refined petroleum products had continued to be imported, the products of the Refinery and the Blending Plant will be subject to a business turnover tax of 32 per cent, at the manufacturing level. For this purpose, the law exempting the turnover of a new business in the first year of assessment from turnover tax is to be amended. In determining the rate of turn\u00adover tax, account has been taken of the fact that imports of crude oil for the Refinery and base oil for the Blending Plant are subect to FEECs. Allowing for FEEC-premia receivable by the Petroleum Corporation on exports of bunkers and naptha, it is estimated that in this financial year, a sum of Rs. 45 million would be received as FEEC revenue on imports of crude and base oils. The present customs duties on crude and base oils will be removed. These measures arei'expected to yield the same amount of revenue that would have accrued if refined petroleum products had continued to be imported.",

As far as possible, this classification followed accepted international practice, as consolidated and presented in the United Nations Manual for Classification of Government Transactions.1 As the Bank's classification yet fell short of the requirements for economic planning, a Working Committee on the National Accounts of Ceylon consisting of represen\u00adtatives of the United Nations Development Programme's National Economic Planning and Programming Project in Ceylon, the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs, the Department of Census and Statistics and the Central Bank of Ceylon was appointed to recommend improvements. This Working Committee's proposals, again based on standard international practice and s*he U. N. Manual referred to, were taken into account by the Central Bank in preparing the revised classification of government receipts and payments for 1964/65 to 1969/70, which is given in Table 35A of Appendix II of the present Report. As there was insufficient time to revise the entire series which was carried in earlier reports, the former unrevised data for years prior to 1964/65 are shown in a separate table, namely, Table 35 of Appendix II. The Tables II (F) 3, II (F) 5, and II (F) 6 of the text contain summary versions of the revised classification. The reconciliation of the revenue and expenditure figures of the Government Accounts and the reclassified receipts and payments as given in Table 35A of Appendix II, is shown in the Table II ( F ) 2.",

For instance, the suggestion that the international practice of showing only the net receipts or payments of govern\u00adment trading enterprises be adopted could not be implemented owing to the lackof sufficient data and the complexity of accounting procedures of these enterprises. Hence, the receipts and payments of these enterprises are shown, as in the past, on a gross basis.
