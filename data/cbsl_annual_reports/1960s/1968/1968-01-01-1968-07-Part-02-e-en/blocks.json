The need to keep inflationary pressures in check was even greater in 1968 in view of the record increase in bank credit to the private sector during the year. Monetary policy had to be reoriented to the needs of the monetary situation that was developing after the devaluation of November 1967 and the subsequent measures of exchange reform introduced in May 1968. The Central Bank therefore found it necessary to continue and, in certain respects, strengthen the restrictive policy which was already in force.",
