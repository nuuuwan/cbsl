    "text": "The trends in Ceylon's balance of payments as they emerged in 1968 were considerably influenced by two major exchange reforms which were instituted in 1967 and 1968. On 22nd November, 1967 the Ceylon rupee was devalued by 20 per cent. On May 6, 1968 the Government introduced a Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme which resulted in a further effective depreciation in the exchange rate for a range of transactions. Concurrently, various measures were taken to liberalize the rigid import and exchange control system. A considerable number of commodities were placed under open general licence1 and certain classes of remittances such as remittance of profits and dividends were liberalized. Other complementary measures were implement\u00aded in the monetary, fiscal and production sectors, with a view towards providing the required incentives for increasing output and for exploiting domestic resources on a more rational basis. All these measures were in some sense designed with a view to rectifying the imbalance in Ceylon's external receipts and payments and consequently reducing the pressures on Ceylon's foreign exchange reserves, which had persisted for some time. The principal measures taken and their respective roles are discussed in greater detail in other sections of this report. The available evidence seems to indicate that the policies and measures initiated in the economic field in 1967 and 1968 exercised a favourable impact on the balance of payments.",

There is therefore a need to supplement domestic resources by external resources, whether they be owned external assets, short-term borrowings or aid. The accelerated pace of investment in recent years has necessitated an element of self-sacrifice in the form of a curtailment of the range and volume of consumer goods imports, while increasing amounts of foreign exchange have been simultaneously devoted to the import of essential raw material and capital goods. However, the rapid increase in Ceylon's population combined with the expansion in domestic money incomes facilitated by monetary expansion and income redistribution policies has limited to some extent, the scope for large scale reduction of consumer goods imports.

Quite apart from the burdensome administrative problem of policing a compli\u00adcated import and exchange control system, and the rapid increase in the incidence of exchange malpractices, the adherence to a rigid quota system in the allocation of foreign exchange appeared to be at once an inefficient and inequitous tech\u00adnique. For example, the more dynamic sectors of industry and agriculture which were dependent on imported inputs for investment and production did not have adequate allocations of foreign exchange which they could have more profitably used. In the meanwhile the continuous decline in Ceylon's foreign exchange earnings due to unfavourable world prices for her principal exports combined with an expansion in the demand for imports, had resulted in a high de facto scarcity price for foreign exchange in terms of Ceylon rupees. The high scarcity price was however, not reflected in the official Exchange rate which was artifically suppressed by a rigid system of foreign exchange rationing.",

Since the rupee values in the year 1968 are inflated by the effect of the devaluation of the currency in November 1967, the foreign exchange equivalent measured in terms of U.S. Dollars is chosen as being the more appropriate measure for ascertaining the effect of the devaluation on the country's external transactions. By this criterion, the overall trade deficit of Ceylon (i.e. including aid financed imports) was reduced from U.S. Dollars 70 million in 1967 to U.S. Dollars 61 million in 1968. These indicators are particularly important in view of the fact that the value of import licences issued in 1968 actually exceeded the value of licences issued in 1967 by Rs. 836-0 million. An even more appropriate measure is to exclude aid financed imports, and in this case the trade deficit shows a decline from U.S. Dollars 18 million in 1967 to U.S. Dollars 5 million in 1968, that is to say, an improvement of 72 per cent. The overall current account deficit on commercial transactions (i.e. including transactions on invisibles) fell from U.S. Dollars 18 million in 1967 to only U.S. Dollars 9 million in 1968.",

Income in foreign exchange from merchandise exports declined from U.S. Dollars 347 million in 1967 to U.S. Dollars 332 million in 1968, while income from the export of services fell by U.S. Dollars 9 million from U.S. Dollars 45 million in 1967. The principal reason for the decline in merchandise export income in 1968 when expressed in terms of foreign exchange has been a fall in the average unit price of tea and rubber exports combined with a fall of 3- 6 per cent in the volume of tea exports in 1968, as compared with the previous year. The fall in foreign exchange income from the sale of services is the result of a marked deterioration in earnings from Port and Harbour dues, partly due to the charges not being revised consequent upon the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee. Earnings from all other sectors in the services account improved in foreign exchange terms. A detailed evaluation of the factors influencing the behaviour of exports in 1968 is given later on in this section. However, it may be briefly noted here that the effects of a change in the exchange rate are likely to manifest themselves more quickly in the import sector through a direct impact on costs than in the export sector, due to supply lags, particularly where primary products play a significant role in export structure.",

    "text": "The provisional estimate of export earnings for 1968 at Rs. 1,975 million shows a substantial increase of Rs. 325 million over 1967. This excludes re-exports of Rs 59.1 million. The increase in export value was partly due to increases in average rupee prices of tea and coconut products and partly due to an increase in the volume of rubber and coconut products. The value of imports estimated at Rs. 2,341 million was Rs. 356 million more than the level of imports in 1967. In rupee terms, these figures of export earnings and import payments were the highest ever recorded in Ceylon's balance of payments. The higher levels of export and import values in 1968 were principally a result of the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee by 20 per cent in November 1967. Import values in 1968 were also considerably increased as a result of an increase in the c.i.f. prices of all major categories of imports and partly because of larger import arrivals under the \"Aid Club\" arrangements. Some part of the higher level of imports in 1968 has resulted from the removal of direct restrictions on imports of certain commodities by their transfer to the open general licence .category2 consequent upon the implementation of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme in May, 1968. The deficit on the Merchandise Account in 1968 provisionally estimated at Rs. 366 million shows an increase of 9 \u2022 2 per cent over the deficit of Rs. 335 million in 1967. In interpreting these figures however, due allowance must be made for the difference between the exchange rates in 1968 and those prevailing in the first eleven months of 1967, owing to the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee. For instance, when export and import values are converted to U.S. Dollar terms, the value of exports showed a decline of U.S. Dollars 15 million to U.S. Dollars 332 million, while import values fell even more, by U.S. Dollars 24 million from U.S. Dollars 417 million in 1967 to U.S. Dollars 393 million in 1968. Consequently, the merchandise trade deficit in dollar terms improved from U.S. Dollars 70 million in 1967 to U.S. Dollars 61 million in 1968.",

    "text": "In 1968 Ceylon's balance on Invisibles Account, inclusive of transfer payments, showed a surplus of Rs 20 million as against a surplus of Rs. 46 million in 1967. The deterioration in the Invisibles Account was due to the combined effect of a fall in earnings and a rise in payments. Total invisible earnings declined from Rs. 262 million in 1967 to Rs. 254 million in 1968, while total invisible payments increased from Rs. 216 million to Rs. 234 million over the same period. The decline in the surplus has been primarily due to a substantial decrease in Port and Harbour dues, and to a lesser extent to increases in investment income payments consequent upon the libera\u00adlization of moratorium releases and to an increase in government expenditures. When the merchandise deficit is adjusted for the smaller surplus on invisibles account in 1968, the current account of Ceylon's balance of payments showed an overall deficit of Rs. 346 million in 1968 as compared with a deficit of Rs. 289 million in 1967.

Total investment goods imports increased from Rs. 532 million in 1967 to Rs. 644 million in 1968, while the value of intermediate goods rose from Rs. 319 million to Rs. 368 million. Marked increases were noticed in the import of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and tractors on the one hand, and industrial inputs, such as machinery, raw materials, chemicals and transport equipment, on the other. The effects of this change in the pattern of imports resulted in a greater utilisation of capacity in 1968, which was evident from the increases in agricultural and industrial production.

The outflow on account of invest\u00adment income increased from Rs. 65 million in 1967 to Rs. 74 million in 1968. The relaxation of the moratorium on investment income resulted in an outflow of Rs. 26 million in 1966 and Rs. 34 million in 1967. The outflow was further intensified in 1968 by a complete lifting of the moratorium, in respect of current incomes, with the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme. The outflow on this account fell in Dollar terms how\u00adever, from U.S. $ 7 million in 1967 to U.S. $ 6 million in, 1968. Remittances of dividends and profits now require the surrender of Foreign Exchange Entitle\u00adment Certificates.

In 1968, the net inward flow of long-term capital was Rs. 224.8 million. This represents a 39 per cent increase over the 1967 net figure of Rs. 160.9 million. The increase is due to greater utilization of commodity and project aid of Rs. 272.8 million and Rs. 40.2 million respectively in 1968 as compared to Rs. 201.8 million and Rs. 33.5 million respectively in 1967. Increases were recorded in aid-financed imports of ferti\u00adlizers and flour: the increased imports of flour helped to mitigate the hardships caused by the steep rise in the c. &. f. price of rice from \u00a3 48 per ton to \u00a3 70 per ton, while the increased imports of fertilizer assisted Ceylon in stepping-up domestic food production.

It was felt that a libera\u00adlization of imported inputs, particularly of industrial and agricultural raw material and investment goods, at a price approximating closely to the true scarcity value of foreign exchange would enable the more efficient and more dynamic industries in the economy to increase output.",

The minor agricultural product export sector had for some time in the past found it increasingly difficult to export at profitable exchange prices and this factor had limited or reduced the attractiveness of increasing invest\u00adment in these industries. In view of the fact that large segments in the minor agricultural product sector were organized on a non-corporate basis it was also felt that the increase in incomes in this sector deriving from the higher premium attached to earnings in foreign exchange would lead to a more socially desirable distribution of incomes. Likewise, many of the import substituting industries established in recent years in which there was a high proportion of Ceylonese entrepreneurship were prevented from expanding their activity, and in fact exist\u00ading activity was considerably curtailed by the rigid control system which was based to a large extent on allocations of foreign exchange based on past produc\u00adtion, or imports. It was felt that a scheme which afforded such firms a greater access to essential inputs might enable them to accelerate output, with consequent effects on employment and incomes. In other cases, there was reason to believe that the progressive alignment of the price of foreign exchange with its true cost would result in an acceleration of domestic production of import substitutes, particularly in the case of raw materials or intermediate goods which may have not been worthwhile at the prevailing official exchange rate.",

The sectors which expanded most in value terms were articles of iron and steel, aluminium products, boots and shoes, chocolate and cocoa products, clothing, tinned or bottled fruits, glycerine and tea machinery. The net addition to Ceylon's dollar earnings as a result of the expansion of exports of manufactures amounted to U.S. ? 1.2 million. The substantial complementary increases in the volume of output in these commodities as is evident from Table II ( G ) 7 offers considerable evidence that such industries were able to exploit unutilized capacity to a larger extent consequent upon the availa\u00adbility of a greater quantity of raw materials and essential inputs as a result of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme.",

    "text": "In the case of primary products the inevitable problem of supply lags in the short run may have handicapped the capacity of many commodities to respond to the incentives provided by the two exchange reforms. Hence it is observed that the percentage increase in the volume of exports of many primary products was more modest as compared with the rate of growth in the volume of exports of manufactures. Nevertheless, even in the case of primary products there have been a number of commodities where exports increased very substantially between 1967 and 1968; thus pepper exports increased sevenfold in value and a number of other products such as cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon chips, cocoa, kapok fibre and nutmeg, showed increases in volume varying from 50 per cent to over 100 per cent. In some of these cases, however, it is difficult to isolate the effects of weather and other factors such as improvements in cultivation and better trans\u00adport, organization and management, from the effects of the incentives provided by the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme per se. However, there is some evidence to confirm the hypothesis that the price incentives provided by the exchange reform of May, 1968, did encourage additional exports of some of the new primary products. For example, it is noted that while there were no exports of fish in chilled or frozen form in 1967, in 1968 such exports amounted to U.S. $ 76 thousand. Similarly, the value of exports of cocoa increased from U.S. * 870 thousand to U.S. $ 1.2 million, while exports of Ilmenite increased from U.S. I 319 thousand to U.S. * 435 thousand.",

In the period after August 1968, the value of Letters of Credit opened has tended to fluctuate between Rs. 30 million to Rs. 40 million per month. On this basis, it is possible that if no major changes are initiated in the monetary and fiscal sectors the annual demand for Letters of Credit in respect of Open General Licence imports would not perhaps exceed Rs. 500 million in a year. This would amount to approximately 21 per cent, of the value of payments on .merchandise imports on the basis of data for the year 1968.",

Since the greater proportion of imports in the Open General Licence Category consists of essential intermediate and investment goods and a modest volume of incentive goods, the availability, of such goods at prices close to their true scarcity value has important financial and economic effects. In the first place, it syphons off the scarcity profits which had been enjoyed in the past by those importers who were recipients of quota privileges. In the second place, it ensures that such imports would occur only where the enterprise to which these inputs are oriented are worth\u00adwhile and profitable. Finally, in the generality of cases the availability of imports without restriction and regimentation would encourage users to economize on the use of foreign exchange since they would prefer to smoothen the flow of imports rather than stock up inventories in anticipation of any tightening of import and exchange controls. They would also be encouraged to purchase from the cheapest source when greater amounts of time are available for examining the competitiveness of alternative sources of supply.",
