Summary

Employment statistics covering all economic sectors are available only from Census Reports for the Census years and from sample surveys for a few selected years. In the absence of data on a regular basis, an analysis of the current employment situation is not attempted here.

The number of persons placed in employment by the Employment Exchanges increased from 4,254 in 1967 to 5,729 in 1968. These figures do not include numbers employed independently of the employment exchanges and in no way reflect the change in the employment situation in the country

The Central Bank conducts an annual survey of employment in the public sector covering government departments and semi-government institutions (Public Corporations, Universities, Research Institutes,Boards etc.). According to this survey, there was a general increase in employment in government departments and semi-government institutions covered by the survey. The total increase in government departments was 2.9 per cent and in semi-government institutions 14.1 per cent. In the government sector, significant increases were recorded in the Land Development, Agrarian Services and Forest Departments. The percentage increases in these departments were 13.0, 8.6, and 5.6 per cent, respectively.

In the semi-government sector, substantial increases in employment were seen in the State Engineering Corporation 23.7 per cent, and the River Valleys Development Board 11.8 per cent. These increases reflect an expansion of investment activity by the Corporations.

The Survey classified employees under four categories (1) Administrative, Technical and Professional, (2) Subordinate, (3) Minor and (4) Others (see notes, to Table II (I) 2). Of the total increase in employment in the government departments, nearly 55 per cent consisted of subordinate employees, about 31 per cent minor employees and 9 per cent administrative, technical and professional employees. In the semi-government sector, the proportions were different. In this sector, about 70 per cent of the increase consisted of minor employees, 18 per cent sub-ordinate employees and 6 per cent administrative, technicaland professional employees.

In regard to employment in private sector industry, according to the Central Bank's Survey on Industrial Production discussed in detail in part II B of the re­port, total employment in the establishments covered increased from 74,000 in 1967 to 101,000 in 1968. This increase of 27,000 or 36 per cent is partly due to a rise in the number of establishments covered in most industrial groups; and, a part of this increase is in respect of industrial corporations. Nevertheless, these figures do indicate that there has been a rise in employment in the private sector industry.

The increase in the number of registrants for employment or better employ­ment with the Employment Exchanges in 1968 at 6.9 per cent was less than in the previous year, viz., 7.6 per cent. Registrants are classified under four cate­gories (a) Technical and clerical, (b) Skilled, (c) Semi-skilled and (d) Unskilled. The largest increase, 10.3 per cent, was in the unskilled category. Unskilled workers constituted 37.8 per cent of the total registrants in 1968.

In 1968, labour relations in the private sector trades as indicated by the number of strikes were better than in the previous year. Compared with 230 strikes in 1967, there were only 166 strikes in 1968. The number of workers

( 245 )

involved too were less than in the previous year. The total number of man-days lost, however, was more than in the previous year. The strikes in tea plantations and in the Colombo Port were mainly responsible for the increase in the number of man-days lost. The principal causes for the strikes were dismissals or loss of employment. Nearly a third of the strikes were due to these causes.

In November 1968, a section of the public servants struck work. This strike which lasted about four weeks, arose mainly from a demand for an increase in salaries.

Number Placed in Employment

The number of persons placed in employment by the Employment Exchanges is given in the Table II (I) 1 below. Out of a total of 5,729 persons placed in employment, 13.3 per cent consisted of technical and clerical, 14.0 per cent skilled, 13.7 per cent semi-skilled and 59.0 per cent unskilled workers. The total number of persons placed represented 2.1 per cent of the number of registrants for employment. The corresponding figure for 1967 was 1.7 per cent.

Employment in the Public Sector

The Central Bank survey for 1968 sought more detailed information from a larger number of government and semi-government institutions than in previous years. The Bank received figures from 89 Government Departments and 46 semi-government institutions. Figures for the departments which did not respond to the inquiry, however, were estimated as far as possible from the information on cadre given in the Estimates of Government Revenue and Eexpenditure for 1967/68 and 1968/69.

The following table shows figures of employment in the government departments covered by the survey at the end of 1967 and 1968 classified under the categories—(1) Administrative, Technical and Professional officers of staff rank (2) Subordinate employees, (3) Minor employees and (4) Others (see notes at the foot of the table).

Registrants for employment

In 1968, there was an increase of 6.9 per cent in the number of registrants for employment or better employment, with the Employment Exchanges. (See Appendix Table 45). The figure for the previous year was 7.6 per cent. The increases for the various categories were 3.7 per cent for technical and clerical, 5.7 per cent for skilled, 6.1 per cent for semi-skilled and 10.3 per cent for un­skilled workers. The comparable figures for the previous year, were 9.9, 8.9, 10.9, and 3.5 per cent, respectively.

Labour Relations1

In 1968, the total number of strikes in the private sector trades and the number of workers involved were less than the corresponding figures for the previous year. There were 166 strikes involving 64,810 workers as against 230 strikes involving 89,851 workers in 1967. Roughly 88 percent of the strikes were in plantations, mainly tea estates. They accounted for roughly 86 per cent of the total number of workers involved. There was also in November 1968, a strike by a section of the public servants lasting about four weeks. This strike arose mainly from a demand for an increase in salaries.

The total number of man-days lost on account of strikes increased from 699,345 to 818,982 i.e. by 17.1 per cent. Of the total for 1968, man-days lost in tea plantations alone amounted to 70 per cent. Significant losses were also seen in the Colombo Port and tea-cum-rubber estates which amounted to 10.2 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively of the total number of man-days lost.

An analysis of the underlying causes for the strikes in 1968 shows that 31.3 per cent of the strikes resulted from dismissals or loss of employment. Strikes due to disputes arising from administrative rules and working arrangements consti­tuted 22.3 per cent and those due to general demands, 10.8 per cent of the total number of strikes.
