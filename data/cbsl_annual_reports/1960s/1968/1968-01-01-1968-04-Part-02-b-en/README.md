Introduction

The analysis of industrial production given below is based on the surveys of manufacturing industry in the private and public sectors conducted by the Centra] Bank and the Ministry of Industries and Fisheries. The method of collecting data was by postal enquiry. The Central Bank survey covers the calender year of 1968. With the limited time available it was neither possible to extend the coverage nor to obtain comprehensive information. This was more difficult because of the preponderance of very small scale businesses in such industries as Tobacco and Food preparations and the need to resort to hand tabulation in the processing of data.

The object of this analysis of industrial production is to give an up to date picture of the structure and working of manufacturing industry - the number, the size, employment, wages, use of raw materials etc. - and to study the contri­bution of each industry or group of industries to the performance of the whole industrial sector. Although an evaluation of the performance of the industrial sector in 1968 is done on the basis of a comparison with previous years, it must be noted that the totals for any two years, are not strictly comparable mainly because of differences in the coverage of industrial units. The allocations of imported industrial raw materials prior to the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Scheme in May 1968 would also distort year to year comparisons. In 1968, a large number of beedi manufacturers included in the Central Bank Survey ceased production when their individual allocations for the import of wrapper leaf were reduced2 and they were also unable to buy it at competitive prices in the open market. However, these were mainly small scale enterprises and their contribution to total production would have been any way insignificant. Since the coverage of all other important categories of industry increased this year there is a large increase in the recorded value of industrial production. At the same time this increase would also reflect the greater availability of imported raw materials in 1968. Practically, all industries depend in varying degrees upon imported raw materials. In 1967, several industries were working below capacity because foreign exchange quotas for the importation of raw materials, though substantially liberalised, were still inadequate to permit capacity production. In 1968, foreign exchange allocations to the private sector industries for import of raw materials and machinery, including imports under Open General Licence were nearly 3C0% more than in 1967. Furthermore with the introduction of the FEEC Scheme in May 1968, a wide range of basic raw materials which had been under strict exchange and import control since 1962, were allowed on Open General Licence. Wherever firms sent in half-yearly returns it was noticed that both quantity and value of production in the second

half were nearly always much higher than that in the first half. It must also be noted that prices of most imported goods increased following the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee in November 1967. Local industrialists also increased their prices as factor cost went up due to the grant of a devaluation allowance to employees and the rise in rupee costs of imported inputs after the devaluation. Thus to a certain extent the increase in the recorded value of industrial production reflects this increase in prices which affects both raw materials purchasing cost and the cost of factor inputs.

The Principal Trends

Table II (B) 1 shows a massive increase of Rs. 444.4 million in the value of industrial production in 1968 - a 46.6 per cent increase over the recorded value of industrial production in 1967. This increase in production was the outcome of factors operating on both demand and supply sides. The demand for consumer goods such as food and textiles were influenced by the increase in real incomes. In fact 52.9 per cent of the increase in the recorded value of industrial production in 1968 was accounted for by the consumer goods cate­gories, Food, beverages and tobacco and Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries (for brevity, hereafter called Textile industry). On the supply side factors such as the greater availablity of raw materials, better labour relations etc have operated to increase output in 1968. An analysis of Table 11 (B) 2 on the value of production classified by type of industry and principal products brings out four main developments (summarised in Table 11(B) 2 (1).

First, a large increase of Rs. 119.4 million in the recorded value of pro duction of the Food preparations industry.

Second, moderate increases in Vegetable oils and fats, Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles, Miscellaneous chemical products, Rubber products' Basic metal products, Fabricated metal products other than machinery and equipment (hereafter, Fabricated metal products) and Machinery (except electrical) and transport equipment (hereafter, Machinery and equipment)

Third, small increases in Biscuits, cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery, (hereafter, Biscuits and confectionery) Beverages, Tobacco, Knitted fabrics and articles and made-up garments and other apparel except footwear (hereafter Garments and apparel), Paper and paper products, Petroleum and coal products, Plastic products, Cement, cement products and asbestos products and Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies (hereafter, Electrical machinery).

Fourth, against the background of expansion in the several lines of industrial activity mentioned above several important industrial groups have tended to stagnate over the period, namely Preserved and canned fruit, vegeta­bles, meat, fish and other sea foods (hereafter, Preserved foods), Footwear and leather products, Wood and plywood, Industrial chemicals, Ceramics, Glass and glass products, Bricks and tiles and llmenite.

Undoubtedly, part of the increase in the value of production in several lines of industrial activity shown above is purely statistical in the sense that new firms or new products are covered by our survey. The change in the number of reporting firms and in the value of production of each major group of industry is summarized at Table II (B) 2 (2).

The number of reporting firms in the Textile Industry increased from 393 to 496 while the recorded value of production of this group increased from Rs. 177.1 million to Rs. 224.3 million. The largest increase in the value of production

( 63 )

occurred in the group Food, beverages and tobacco; however, the number of reporting firms in this group fell rather sharply from 822 in 1967 to 588 in 1968. This was due to the exit of small scale beedi manufacturers from the industrial scene. In 1968, the Department of Rural Development and Small Industries reduced the allocations of individual permit holders and gave new allocations to 3000 other manufacturing units, not covered by our Survey. The limitation of supplies of this vital raw materials through smaller individual allocations forced several small scale manufacturers to go out of production Despite this decline in the number of reporting firms in the beedi industry, the recorded value of production of the tobacco industry itself showed a sizeable increase of Rs. 18.5 million, largely owing to the growth momentum generated in the cigarette manufacturing industry. The number of reporting firms in the Wood and plywood group increased from 14 to 20. This increase was associated with an increase of Rs. 6.5 million in the value of production. Likewise the number of reporting firms in Chemical, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products group, (hereafter, Chemicals industry) increased from 246 to 284 and the value of its production increased by Rs. 66.6 million. This large increase in the Chemical group is undoubtedly linked to the rapid growth of other branches of industry. Chemicals are used by branches of manufacture such as soaps, matches, textiles, as well as certain branches of the chemical industry itself such as pharmaceuticals, paints, toilet preparations, insecticides etc. Non-metallic mineral products except petroleum and coal (hereafter, Non-metallic minerals) had fewer firms reporting this year, but the recorded value of production of this group increased by Rs. 23.3 million largely owing to an increase in the output of its sub-group, Cement, cement products and asbestos products. Within the sub-group itself, asbestos production is not increasing as fast as the progress in the buildings industry might warrant owing to the deliberate policy of the Government to restrict the import of raw materials for this industry in order to foster the development of the local tile industry.

Fabricated metal products group had 70 more firms reporting this year while the value of its output increased by Rs 65.1 million. The principal sub­group here contains barbed wire, wire nails, galvanised products etc. Thus, the increase in value of production of this group must be associated with the upsurge in constructional activity evident in recent years. The other engineering sections of this industrial group had a whole range of miscellaneous products such as manufactured parts for boats, sewing machines, bicycles, cars etc.

In order to make an estimate of the real increase in the value of produc tion in 1968, a sample of 134 firms whose value of production in 1967 was over Rs. 5 lakhs was taken to observe the change in both the quantity and value of their production over the period. It was not always possible to compare quantities of output between the two years because most firms have either not used the same unit of measurement in both years or have failed to supply this information at all. Wherever a meaningful comparision was possible it was noticed that several pace-setting firms in the important growth sectors of industry had a larger quantity of output in 1968, the percentage increase in output nearly always more than offset the increase in prices. Table II (B) 2 (3)

( 64 )

shows the change in the value of production of this sample of firms classified according to the major industrial groups- The overall percentage increase in the value of production for this sample was 34.3 as against 46.6 for all reporting firms.

Changing Pattern of Industrialisation

A further analysis of Table II (B) 2 shows that basically no great changes have taken place in the structure and pattern of industrialisation since 1967. As in the previous year, the processing of foodstuffs continues to be the most important branch of industry. The manufacture of Food, beverages and tobacco accounts for nearly 44 per cent of the total value of industrial production in 1968, the same as in 1967. However, trends since 1964 show a change in the pattern of industrialisation. While the first two categories of industry namely, Food, beverages and tobacco and Textiles industry show a falling trend over the period, the last three categories namely, Non metallic mineral products, Basic and Fabricated metal products have increased their relative importance. The relative importance of the Food processing industries has declined to about half the shares held in 1964, while the share of the Textile industry has also declined to about 90 per cent of its former size. On the other hand, the relative importance of Basic and Fabricated Metal products groups, has risen from 7.2 per cent in 1964 to 14.0 per cent in 1968. Thus the Metal products groups constitute the most dynamic sectors in industrial growth.

These broad changes are also discernible in Table II (B) 3 where the value of industrial production is classified by type of industry and principal products. While in 1964, the industries broadly defined as Consumer goods represented nearly 63.3 per cent, and Investment goods, very broadly defined to include construction materials, metals and equipment amounted to about 10 per cent of the total value of industrial production in 1968, the percentage value of the consumer goods category had fallen almost steadily to 49.7 per cent. On the other hand, the value of Investment goods category had increased to 16.1 per cent.

The pattern of industrial output changes in the process of industrialisation. As industrialisation advances by stages, the normal pattern of change is a relatively rapid growth in the demand for capital goods, chemicals and durable consumer goods and a relatively small demand for food, textiles and clothing. However, factors other than demand are also responsible for this changing pattern of output in the different stages of industrialisation. At first, manufacture is necessarilly confined to processes requiring simple techniques and little expertise, thus favouring the production of a whole range of consumer goods. Before long, however, the optimum-sized firms of the chemical and capital goods industries appear on the industrial scene. This trend is accelerated by the expansion of markets, technological change and the diffusion of industrial skills. Viewed in the broadest perspective, this development may also be con­sidered as the outcome of those economic and political factors compelling internationally operating combines to establish plants nearer the consuming centres. In fact, the survey reveals that the local branches of foreign firms imparted a high growth momentum to the industrial sector in 1968.

Two conclusions emerge from the foregoing analysis of the structure and pattern of industrialisation. First, the most dynamic sectors in industrial growth are Fbricated metal products, Machinery and equipment and Electrical machinery. Second, the pattern of industrial growth is shifting away from consumer goods towards capital goods industries.

The Size of the Industrial Unit

The size distribution of manufacturing firms according to the value of output and wage bill is given at Tables II (B) 4 and II (B) 5, respectively.

As in previous years, smal scale industry is concentrated in the consumer goods sector and is the main supplier of such commodities as coffee, chilly and curry powders, macaroni, noodles and spaghetti, pappadam etc. and knitted and made-up garments. In the Tobacco industry a reduction in individual import allocations created a shortage of wrapper leaf to individual manufacturing units. The inevitable outcome was the development of a black market in this vital raw material. Evidently, it became more profitable for the small scale entrepreneur to sell his allocation rather than engage in the production of beedi. Thus the new policy of allocations weakened small scale enterprise and at the same time favoured the development of the large scale establishment. The Central Bank survey shows that the share of the seven largest firms in the total value of beedi production increased from 25.9 per cent in 1967 to 41.6 per cent in 1968.

According to Table II (B) 4, there are 97 firms with an annual output of over Rs. 2 million. The total output of these 97 firms is nearly Rs. 722 million or 54.7 per cent of the total value of production. By contrast, in 1967 there were 59 firms with an output of over Rs. 2 million; their relative share in total production was much higher amounting to nearly 67 per cent. Likewise, the percentage of firms carrying a total output between-Rs. 250,000 and Rs. 2 million also dropped from 25.3 in 1967 to 17.2 in 1968. Thus, the relative share of the

In Table II (B) 4 (1) data on production, employment and wages of selected firms are assembled to show the oligopolistic character of local industry. It will be seen that a considerable part of large scale production is concentrated in specific categories of industry specialising in the production of specific items. Excluding the larger units in the public sector, the largest firms are to be found in the following industries: Soft drinks and carbonated waters, Beer and Stout, Cement and Asbestos, Footwear and Leather, Electrical Machinery and equipment, Rubber products and Chemical products. In the Rubber products industry, four firms account for 76.8 per cent of total production. In Soft drinks and carbonated waters, the degree of concentration is even higher; 4 firms account for 89. 5per cent of total production. In serval other industries, the same process of growth and consolidation has taken place. In Footwear and leather products, for example, 4 firms account for nearly 74 per cent of total output and one of

smaller firms in total output increased from 8.3 in 1967 to 28.1 in 1968. However, the degree of concentration of production in certain lines of industry is much higher than is indicated by these figures.

( 68 )

these has as much production as the other three. Together these 164 firms included in our sample study, account for 55.4 per cent of the value of indus­trial production, 42.3 per cent of total employment and 61.6 per cent of total wages. In several lines of industry large scale operations have been favoured by the nature of producing methods and technological developments within the industry. In some Industries, particularly Chemicals, the process of manufacture yields joint products. In order to obtain optimum returns from industry the firms must branch out in new directions. Thus the scale of operation is enlarged and the tendency in these industries is towards large scale manufacture.

An analysis of Table II (B) 5 will help to complete this account of the size dis­tribution of firms. As might be expected, the largest frequency of firms occurs in the group where the total wage bill is less than Rs. 15,000; however, they account for only 3-1 per cent of the total wage bill. On the other hand, there are only 56 firms in the group where the total wage bill is Rs.500,000, but these account for 63 per cent of the total wages paid by all reporting firms.

The foregoing analysis shows the predominance of large scale industry as measured by the size of employment and size of production. The most striking feature of size distribution, which a detailed analysis alone will bring out, is the tendency for small scale firm to lose ground in certain important sectors of industry. In the beedi industry, this has been the incidental outcome of the policy measures which favoured the development of the larger sized firm; in the Chemical industries, this is the inevitable result of technological economies of scale leading to the development of the large scale firm.

Use of Raw Materials

1,298 firms have supplied information regarding the use and origin of raw materials this year as against only 563 firms in 1967. These data are classified in Table II (B) 6. The degree of availability of imported raw materials is one of the major constraints in the fuller utilization of plant and machinery. This is clearly seen in Table II (B) 6. The total value of raw materials used by report­ing firms was Rs. 427.7 million of which Rs. 152.0 million or 35.5 per cent was classified under local and Rs. 275.7 million or 64.5 per cent was classified under

foreign. The foreign raw material component was very high in the following groups of industry: Basic Metal Products (96.3 per cent), Fabricated metal products (84 per cent), Non-metallic Mineral products (79 per cent), Paper and paper products (67.1 per cent) and Chemical products (62.4 per cent). With the solitary exception of Wood and wood products all other groups of industry had a foreign raw material component of over 40 per cent. At the same time the ratio of the value of foreign raw materials to the value of production of some of these groups is also high. These ratios are as follows: Basic Metal products,68.3 per cent, Fabricated metal products, 49.8 per cent, Paper and paper products, 35.8 per cent and Textiles industry, 32.1 per cent.

The fact that the foreign raw material component of local industry is high implies that changes in the rate of industrial growth will be related, among other things to the availability of foreign raw materials. Thus, the large increase in industrial production in 1968 is partly the outcome of those policy measures which allowed a more liberal allocation of foreign exchange to local industrialists. As mentioned elsewhere in this Report, in nearly all manufacturing industries the substantial increase in the value of production occurred in the second half of 1968 after the introduction of the FEEC Scheme.

Employment

Industrial employment for the firms covered by our survey amounted to about 101,348 persons; an increase of 27,393 over the previous year. Part of this increase is statistical, since this year's survey had a wider coverage of those indusrial groups with a high labour intensity of production. Output per employee increa­sed frcmRs. 12,902 in 1967 to Rs. 13,800 in 1968. In the Food beverages and tobacco group there was a sharp fall in employment from 26,401 in 1967 to 24,878 in 1968; however, the largest increase in production was recorded in this group. This seemingly conflicting movements in the two variables is partly attributable to the sharp decline in the number of reporting firms in the Tobacco industry-where labour intensity of production is very high. It must also be noted that the man-days per employee for this group of industry increased from 275 to 286, which partly offset the substantial decline in employment within the group. Thus, the total man-days for this group declined by only 129,000. The highest employment generating industries were the Textiles and the Fabricated metals group. In the former an increase of Rs. 47. 2 million in the aggregate value of production is associated with an increase 15,476 additional employees or 56.5 per cent of the increase in the total labour force of industry. In the latter, an increase of Rs. 65.1 million in output was associated with 7,881 additional employees. However, in both groups man-days per employee fell, in the former from 266 to 262 and in the latter from 258 to 253. For all other groups of industry (excluding Manufactured products n.e.s.) man-days per employee increased. Consequently there is an overall increase of lOman-days per employee in 1968 and total man days increased from 19,315,000 in 1967, to 27,462,000 in 1968 a percentage increase of 42.2. The foregoing analysis suggests that the increas e in the value of industrial production in 1968 can be partly attributed to an ^crease in the productivity of labour.

( 72 )

Wages

The total wagebill of the reporting firms increased from Rs.128.0 million to

Rs. 188.4 million or by 47.2 per cent, corresponding to the increase of Rs. 444-4 million or 46-6 per cent in the total value of industrial production. Wage per man day was higher for the industrial group Basic metal products, a single public sector firm accounting for this relatively high wage rate. The largest increase in wage per man day occurred in the group Non-metallic minetal products. Here there were three public sector firms with relatively higher wage rates. An increase of Rs. 1.55 per man day occurred in the Chemicals Group. The wage per man day in this group is Rs. 9.86, the third highest of all industrial groups; however, this average conceals the high wages paid by some of the foreign pharmaceutical and other chemical firms in this group of industries. Three of them, had a wage per man day of over Rs. 20. In fact, the highest wages per man day for all reporting firms were paid by these foreign firms. Wages per man day fell in two groups of industries, viz., Food preparations, from

Rs. 7.17 to Rs. 6.59 and Paper and paper products from Rs. 7.73 toRs.7.50. Within the Food preparations group wages per man day ranged between Rs. 3.60 (Biscuits and confectionery) to Rs. 10.60 (Vegetable oils and fats). The Beverage industry also had a high wage per man day of Rs. 10.22. A comparison of Table II (B) 3 and Table II (B) 4 ( 1 ) shows that wage rate is high in industries where a few firms account for a large percentage of total employment and total wage bill. Thus, the highest increase in wages per man day of Rs.3.16 occurred in the Non-metallic products group where seven firms control 80.3 per cent of total production, 55.6 per cent of employment and 66.0 per cent of the total wage bill. At the other end we have the Food preparations group, where the degree

of concentration is much less, and 41 firms control only 4-19 per cent of total production. It is perhaps significant that the wage per man-day for this group

of industry has fallen.
