Following a slight decrease of 1.1 per cent in 1967, there was an 18 percent increase in imports in 1968 due partly to a rise in rupee costs (due to devaluation) and partly to the liberalisation of imports after the exchange reforms introduced in May 1968. Though export earnings rose by Rs 345 million ( 2 0 % ) as compared with a decline in the previous year, it was not adequate to arrest the adverse trend in the balance of payments position.

    "text": "Despite a slower rate of expansion in money supply and a higher rate of growth of real product, prices moved up faster than in 196?. It would be recalled that in past years monetary expansion was well above the expansion in real output. Under stringent import and exchange controls this monetary ex\u00adpansion did not fully leak out of the economy through balance of payments deficits. Nor were there adequate supplies of domestically produced goods to mop up the resulting excess liquidity in the economy. Prices were also prevented from moving up as fast as they would normally have under these circumtances in view of price controls and rationing. Consequently, by the end of 1967 there was substantial pent up demand in the economy built up over several past years In fact the liquid assets in the hands of the public amounted to as much as 48 per cent of GNP in 1967. This liquidity ratio dropped to 44 per cent in 1968 while the income velocity of money went up from 4*7 to 5-3. Thus while monetary expansion in 1968 itself was lower than in 1967 and the expansion of real pro\u00adduct substantially higher, the pent up demand of previous years combined with a higher velocity of circulation resulted in the price level going up faster.",

The increase in revenue from export duties reflected an increase in export taxes on tea and rubber; price increases which occurred after devaluation and a small expansion in exports. A fall in revenue from import duties by Rs. 30 million reduced its importance in the revenue structure from 27.8 per cent in 1966/67to 23.8 per cent in 1967/68. Reduction in import duties on some items, the abolition of import licence fees for most of the imports and a fall in the value of dutiable imports accounted for this decline. Measures designed to increase revenue through excise duties brought in a further Rs. 39 million, the bulk of which (Rs. 29 million) was from tobacco tax.",

After allowing for profits on the sale of sugar, flour and a few other items, the net subsidy increased by Rs. 104.5 million (or by 54.1 per cent). Though the quantity of imported rice fell during the year there was a sharp increase in the import price of rice by 51 per cent from Rs. 654 to Rs. 988 per long ton. Besides, there was also an increase in the guaranteed price (from Rs. 12 to Rs. 14 per bushel of paddy). Although the issue of local rice under the ration declined from 238,159 tons to 210,000 tons (by 12 per cent) the rise in price was by a higher percentage (16.6 per cent). It need hardly be emphasised that in a country like Ceylon which has embarked on social welfare programmes on education, health, food, etc. there is an inevitable increase in current expenditure due to growth of population.",

A rise in recurrent and capital expenditures and advance account operations, offset to some extent by increased revenue collection had^the effect of raising the net cash deficit to a new high. The sources of financing this deficit are shown in Table 1-2. Evidently, domestic market borrowing from the banking system (mainly from Central Bank) had been the main source of finance, accounting for nearly 42 per cent of the net cash deficit. As at September, 1968, Central Bank holdings of Treasury Bills was 91 per cent of the total of the authorised limit of Rs. 1,750 million. Market borrowing from non-bank sources tends to reduce the liquidity of the private sector and this method of financing which comprised 35 per cent of the net cash deficit is the least expansionary. The Government had recourse to foreign borrowing mostly in the form of project loans and commodity loans; its share was 26 per cent of the total net cash deficit. (At the same time there was an increase in cash balances-) This method of financing is not expansionary because it augments the real resources of the country through imports. Use of counterpart funds and drawing down cash balances are expansionary at the time of their utilisation.",

    "text": "On the whole the net expansionary impact of Government operations was very much higher in 1967/68 (by Rs. 211 million) than in the previous year. Foreign assistance and market borrowing from domestic non-bank sources both declined below the previous year's level. In order to encourage the non-bank sources to supply a larger volume of money to Government operations through Government securities the Government implemented the recommendation of the Monetary Board to raise interest rates from 4 i per cent to 5A per cent on long term (21-25 years) loans. The decline in the amount contributed to Government securities may be due to the availability of avenues for industrial and other investment, in the private sector. This combined with a decline -in the amount of foreign loans and grants resulted in the Government having to increase its borrowing by as much as Rs. 176.4 million from the Central Bank.",

In 1967/68 Government retired Rs. 21.6 million of food import bills held by the banking system.

    "text": "The rate of growth of income enlarges the tax base. A developing country such as Ceylon cannot place heavy reliance on direct taxes. At the same time heavy dependence on Customs duties as the major source of revenue tends to reduce the elasticity of public revenue. Cost or quantitative restrictions on imports and declining prices for exports are likely to reduce the importance of customs duties as a major source of revenue. Accordingly, the turnover tax is increasingly becoming an important source of revenue. This emphasises the need to resort to indirect taxes not only to siphon off a part of the increased incomes at the time of spending but also to allow free market forces through the cost structure to play its major role in the allocation of resources. Taxes on expenditure favour savings, thereby inducing growth. A consumer has the choice of postponing the payment of tax by reducing consumption and earning an income (interest) on the amount thus saved. These indirect taxes falling as they do on consumption discriminate against low savers in favour of high savers. Alongside this measure, the use of prices as a deliberate steering mechanism not only allocates resources efficiently but also controls excess demand by absorbing a part of it.",

This was the highest ever recorded in recent years. The largest increase in advances was in the category of loans; there were also substiantial increases in overdrafts, import bills and export bills. The increase in end-year-figures of credit outstanding was mainly accounted for by advances to the industrial and commercial sectors. In the field of agricultural credit, the gross volume of loans extended by banks for the Maha 1967/68 and Yala 1968 seasons under the new Agricultural Credit Scheme was higher than that for any year under previous schemes. The rise in agricultural loans has been matched by an increase in output and has been accompanied by a larger degree of monetization of the rural sector.

    "text": "Imports in money terms rose faster than the rise in Gross National Product mainly due to devaluation. The proportion of imports in consumption was higher in 1968 than in the previous year; the import coefficient of private con\u00adsumption rose from 0.15 in 1967 to 0.17 in 1968 and that of capital formation from 0.23 to 0.24. Liberalisation of imports together with the price increase caused by devaluation raised the dependence on imports. In the context of a rising import coefficient it is noteworthy that the repercussions on the balance of payments situation did not make the deficit very large. This was due to a rise in the export earnings in rupee terms after the devaluation. Exports rose by Rs. 345 million. The balance of trade however was unfavourable. In this, the effects of three factors\u2014 price, volume and terms of trade \u2014are mixed up. Since the foreign price of tea fell, the price effects and terms of trade effects can be considered as being due to devaluation effects, while the volume increase stands on its own. It is to be noted that the volume of tea exports actually fell; the existence of bilateral agreements to the purchase of rubber poses no problems in the sale of the entire outpur of rubber; volume effects of coconuts and coconut products give only a small weightage in the export earnings.",

The prices of import substitutes moved up as the level of protection given to them increased by these changes. The exchange reforms adopted in May 1968 had the effect of bringing down the prices of some commodities with an elastic demand and where the proportionate increase in supply was almost equivalent to the proportionate increase in demand and where it was uneconomic to carry large stocks.",

The backlog of effective demand combined with the shortage of supply would result in price increases as long as domestic output does not respond proportionately or imports increase in the same proportion to meet the excess demand. The growth of output in the agricultural and industrial sectors had been remarkable in 1968, but the aggregate demand had been of such a magnitude that this increase of output was not adequate to ward off any increase in price. In the circumstances, the monetary expansion would exert pressure on prices unless consumption and probably investment are kept in check. But a curtailment on investment is not a healthy measure for a growing economy, and alternative steps have to be taken in the monetary and fiscal fields until real product increased in proportionate terms to meet the aggregate demand.",

Thus, when incomes rise, consumption is expected to go up at least to the old level, but the pressure of demand on existing supplies would tend to push up prices. At the same time there was an increase in supply as a result of increased production but this increase was insufficient to meet the local demand position. Total domestic production at 64.6 million bushels of paddy (less seed paddy) gives a rice equivalent of 858,000 tons. Imports in 1968 amounted to 344,000 tons of rice and 359,000 tons of flour. The total cereal supply adjusted for stocks at 1,494 thousand tons was about 90 per cent of the estimated demand for cereals of 1,660 thousand tons.1",

Under this scheme, when selected multipurpose co-operative societies are allowed to accept time and savings deposits, they are called rural banks. These rural banks, primarily because they are co-operative societies, lack depositors' confidence and the prosperous farmers prefer to invest their surplus funds in physical assets. The develop\u00adment of rural banking depends on a complex of factors such as depositors' confidence, progress of banking habits, profitability of this commercial activity, the service it can provide, and its ability to work within the social framework that is peculiar to a particular area. One preliminary step in the right direction can be taken by these rural banks by seggregating the customers'deposits and managing the money on strictly banking lines. Owing to the present weaknesses in the management of some of the co-operative societies, it is doubtful whether co-operatives can attract funds as well as lend funds to and from members. To win the confidence of the depositors a rural bank has not only to assure the safety of the deposits through a deposit insurance scheme but also provide credit for productive purposes while at the same time give them limited accommodation for certain consumption purposes.",

In 1964, the foreign exchange consrraint adversely affected the manufacturing industry; this together with an over- valued rate of exchange, inflated investment cost and production costs and the presence of idle capacity led to a slow rate of growth at the beginning of 19b5. But impressive increases in production were observed soon after, mainly due to larger foreign exchange allocations, fuller utilization of produc\u00adtive capacity and entry of new industries. Quantitative restrictions and industrial allocations can lead to discriminatory limitations and the growth of uneconomic industries in the long run. The introduction of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Scheme removes such barriers and allows market forces to allocate the resources and aid the emergence of a viable industrial sector.",

Thus, for instance, a 20 per cent devalution was felt to be adequate to meet the problems of major exports but was clearly unsuitable to meet the problem of other exports. Similarly, on the import side, while-a 20 per cent devaluation gave a sufficient mark up in the costs of a; wide range oftessential imports, it was insufficient to permit an adequate liberalisation of imports, especially for growing sectors of the economy.

The experience of this scheme in Ceylon and elsewhere seemed to support the view that in the prevailing circumstances the introduction of a dual rate of exchange would provide more effective measures for export promotion and expansion than a more depreciated unitary rate. It was mentioned in the Annual Report for 1967 that, though devaluation would provide some additional incentives to producers, these would be inadequate for Ceylon's minor exports to break into highly competitive markets. A multiple rate of exchange has the further advantage that the pricing of exports and imports should be more realistic than under a unitary system",

It is mentioned elsewhere in this Report that agricultural production for domestic use rose by 29 per cent in 1968, while industrial production rose by 47 per cent. Manufacturing exports can be ex\u00adpanded under subsidies when competition in other markets is keen. A realistic exchange rate can achieve the same objective in a more simple way. It should however be noted that an exchange rate reform can promote exports only in a relatively stable framework of domestic prices. A rise in domestic prices of essential commodities will push up wage and other costs and if monetary expan\u00adsion goes on unrestricted it will result in persistent inflation.",

Credit control, therefore, constituted an essential part of the strategy of the scheme. On the fiscal side, it was sought to eliminate gradually the inflationary impact of Government finance by reducing to a minimum the resort to borrowing from the banking system.

But the higher price to be paid for imports curtailed the ability to import, and induced importers to adjust the supply in accordance with the elasticity of demand for the commodities. The price effect would have resulted in lower profits which had been fairly high under the quota system. As competition grows, it is likely that a part of the profits will be passed on to the consumers in the form of lower prices or by keeping the price constant in the face of rising costs. The producers will also be directing their efforts towards improving quality. The process of improving efficiency would be assisted by encouraging sales in competitive foreign markets or permitting small quotas for the import of competing products. The availability of imports at a higher price would make the producers practice economies in the use of raw materials, intermediate, and even investment goods and rationalise the amount of exchange that they would purchase.",

It is too early to assess the effect of the FEEC Scheme on minor exports. Most of the minor exports are agri\u00adcultural commodities or depend on local agricultural raw materials. The elasticity of supply in these agricultural commodities being low, an immediate expansion in exports would come about largely as a result of diversion of domestic consumption towards exports. In view of the small size of domestic market, such immediate diversion on a substantial scale cannot be expected. Hence the reaction of minor exports to the FEEC Scheme is likely to be somewhat lagged.",

A change in any or all of these variables could have a direct effect on the demand for goods in this category. While therefore monetary management is of utmost significance, it would appear that, if there is a significant increase in demand for OGL category imports because of the growth of demand or because of the addition of commodities - the growth of OGL imports would require the most careful supervision. The Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme ensures the availablity of foreign exchange for defined categories of payments. Substan\u00adtively, this price should be a function of the foreign exchange demanded and supplied in the market. A reduction of the supply of foreign exchange due to adverse world market conditions or a reduction in the competitiveness of exports would have adverse effects on the country's foreign exchange reserves if exchange is continued to be provided at a price that is not in consonance with current conditions in the foreign exchange market. Thus the price of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates requires the closest possible attention. Simultaneously, complementary measures in the monetary and fiscal field are required to support this Scheme because the effects of such policies on the demand for imports are seen much more quickly in an economy which relies less on controls.",

The exclusion of credit to Government Corporations needs some explanation. It would be recalled that these Corporations, which in past years had recourse to the Government for their credit, were required to obtain such credit from the banking system, and to that extent the Government's own credit requirments would have been lower. To have included credit to Corporations within the ceiling initially would have unduly restricted their activities. Consideration would have to be given at an appropriate future date to restricting credit to the Government Corporation sector, especially in view of the substantial expansion of credit to this sector in 1968.",

Part of this increase was due to the effects of devaluation and a greater increase in the world market price of rice than anticipated at the time of the Budget. The grave consequences of such an increase in the expansionary impact of the budget were contained by a decline of external banking assets by Rs. 116 million and by maintaining severe controls on monetary expansion to the private sector.

This was reflected in rising prices which, according to the Consumer Price Index, increased by 5.9 per cent. The actual rise in the general level of prices is not portrayed by the Consumer Price Index. Large holdings of liquid assets and high levels of perso\u00adnal incomes with a high propensity to consume exerted pressure on prices.

The price level, in particular the price of foreign exchange, is fundamental to the restoration and maintence of equilibrium in the balance of payments. At the same time, the cost and availability of finance must be such as not to penalise the growth sectors cf the economy.

Thus, even though the monetary per\u00adformance in 1968 was satisfactory and led to a high degree of stability, there is no-room for complacency. Monetary expansion in the economy would have to be carefully watched and in this connection the need for financial restraint in the Government Budget cannot be over-emphasized.",

    "text": "Conclusion The satisfactory economic performance in 1968 was mainly the result of expansion in output for domestic use. The rate of economic growth at 8.3 per cent outstripped population growth, and per capita real income grew at an annual rate of 6.1 per cent. There was a high degree of monetary stability, despite an increase in credit to the private sector and a large expansionary impact of the Budget. Though the supply position improved considerably, there were still shortages relative to a higher level of demand in certain sectors of the economy. The price level moved up at a much higher rate than in previous years. The persistent deficits in the balance of payments necessitated the reform of the exchange system. The introduction of the FEEC Scheme was one of the far reaching changes made in 1968. Apart from achieving a more realistic exhange rate, it helped the expansion of industrial output through a greater availability of raw materials and the expansion of minor exports though still on a limited scale. The balance of payments situation, however, in rupee terms was less favourable in 1968 than in 1967, but it showed an improvement in dollar terms. Had the terms of trade not deteriorated there would have been a greater improve\u00adment in the balance of payments.",
