Both revenue and voted expenditure increased by 10.3 per cent, and 15.1 per cent, respectively over the previous year. Recurrent expenditure at Rs. 2,186.2 million was 15.3 per cent above the 1966/67 level. The expenditure chargeable to capital votes increased to Rs. 714-4 million from Rs. 624-7 million in the previous year. Advance account operations in 1967/68 resulted in a net receipt of Rs. 28.5 million in contrast to a net payment of Rs. 41-6 million in 1966/67. The net cash deficit as a result of these operations amounted to Rs. 715.7 million, as compared with Rs. 606.8 million and Rs. 566.0 million in 1966/67 and 1965/66 respectively. The net cash deficit of 1967/68 was financed by borrowing Rs. 551.8 million from domestic market sources, obtaining Rs. 190.2 million from foreign finance and securing Rs. 9.8 million from domestic non-market sources. The expansionary impact of the net cash deficit, when adjusted for changes in U.S. Aid counterpart funds, was Rs. 267.4 million. This was in contrast to the expansionary impact of Rs. 56.1 million in 1966/67 and Rs. 122.4 million in 1965/66.",

    "text": "The. financial year 1967/68 in which the above changes took place was an eventful year in the field of Government finance. This was due to several important economic reforms which were initiated after the presentation of the Budget for 1967/68, which in turn had significant effects on Government fiscal operations. First, the Rupee was devalued in November, 1967, and this enhanced the import-component of Government expenditure. A further increase in expenditure resulted from the payment of an additional \"interim\" allowance to Government servants and pensioners. The new duties levied on certain major exports immediately after devaluation and the improvement in rupee prices of major exports after devaluation resulted in enhanced revenue to the Govern\u00adment. Secondly, the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme in May, 1968 resulted in further enhancement of Govern\u00adment revenue, partly offset by a shortfall in revenue due to the abolition of import-licence fees on most imports and the reduction in or abolition of certain import duties at the same time. Incidentally, the alteration of the basis of tax\u00adation of imports from rhe wholesale market value to c.i.f. value which resulted from the adoption of the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature in August, 1968 led to a further diminution in revenue. The sum-total of the effects of these reforms was a radical change in the final out-turn of Government fiscal operations, from what was anticipated at the time of the presentation of the Budget for 1967/68.",

This was in contrast to an over-estimate of total revenue made in two previous financial years of Rs. 64.6 million and Rs. 78.3 million respectively. The higher out-turn in 1967/68 was largely due to revenue from export duties, income tax and receipts of Government enterprises being higher than anticipated. On the other hand, the revenue from import duties was lower than estimated, due mainly to the abolition of the import licence fee on most imports.",

Although the rate of increase is lower than that of 1967/68, it is yet higher than the average rate of increase (compound) during the last ten or five years.

The increase during the year under review was due partly to the increase in the sliding scale of coconut export duties in November, 1967 immediately after the devaluation of the Ceylon Rupee5 and partly to a general improvement in export-prices and export volume. The revenue from copra in 1967/68 increased by Rs. 5.0 million or 138.9 per cent, in contrast to a decline of Rs. 3,3 million or 47.8 per cent during the previous financial year, due to a 5.7 per cent, increase in export volume and a 37.1 per cent increase in average export-price. The duty collections from desiccated coconut rose sharply by Rs. 23.6 million or 406.9 per cent, as against a decline of Rs. 2.8 million or 32.6 percent, in the previous year. This was due to a 35.3 per cent, increase in export-volume and a 77.8 per cent, increase in average export-price.

It was thus possible to maintain the high level of revenue of the preceding year which was attained by more effective assessment and measures to combat tax evasion. The increase was also due to additional taxes levied on a large number of taxpayers after re-scrutinization of assessments of past years, registration of new taxpayers, crediting of monthly recoveries (pending assess\u00adment) to revenue and an increase in trade income over the previous year. Meanwhile, estate duty and personal tax (i.e. wealth and gift taxes) showed marginal increases in 1967/68.",

    "text": "The resultant increase of Rs. 310.5 million or 12.1 per cent, in expenditure over the previous year 1966/67 was due mainly to an increase in voted expen\u00additure of Rs. 380.6 million or 15.1 per cent, and the net receipt of Rs. 28.5 million from advance accounts which was in contrast to a net payment of Rs 41.6 million during the previous year. The substantial increase in voted expenditure was largely a result of a 15.3 per cent, or Rs. 290.9 million increase in expenditure chargeable to recurrent votes 2 which (as will be explained later) was due mainly to the \"interim\" allowances paid to Government employees and pensioners and an increase in the net food subsidy. Meanwhile, the expenditure chargeable to capital votes3 increased by Rs. 89.7 million or 14.4 Per cent.",

Total expenditure which had increased at an average rate (compound) of 5.8 per cent, during the ten financial years ending 1966/67, increased by 12.1 per cent, in 1967/68 and is expected to increase further by 12.4 per cent in 1968/69. The increases in recent years are accounted for by increases in recurrent expenditure and in expenditure chargeable to capital votes. The former which increased at an average rate of 5.7 per cent, in the ten years referred to, increased by 15.3. per cent, in 1967/68 and is expected to increase by 7.8 per cent, in 1968/69. On the other hand, the expenditure chargeable to capital votes increased by an average rate of 12.4 percent, up to 1966/67, increased by 14.4 per cent, in 1967/68 and is estimated to rise by 22.2 per cent in 1968/69. It should be noted, however, that there are certain items of a capital nature included in the Government estimates under recurrent expenditure. When these items are transferred to capital expenditure, the average rate of increase of capital expenditure during the ten years ending 1966/67 was 8.0 per cent. In 1967/68, this rate rose to 13.0 per cent, and in 1968/69, it is estimated to go up by 19.2 per cent.",

    "text": "It was mentioned in last year's Annual Report that the changes in the rice-ration made in December, 1966 and increased profits from the sale of flour and sugar partly resulted in a reduction of the Government's net food subsidy during 1966/67.1 The full effects of the changes in the pattern of cereal con\u00adsumption consequent on the Government's decision of December, 1966 were felt during the year 1967/68. The main contributory factors to the sharp increase in the net food subsidy were an increase in the gross subsidy on account of imported rice by Rs. 77.4 million or 35.4 per cent, and on account of locally produced rice by Rs. 30.0 million or 14.6 per cent. The former was due partly to a sharp rise in the average landed cost of imported rice by Rs. 334 to Rs. 988 per long ton (or by 51 per cent) during 1967/68. It was partly offset by a reduction in the issue of imported rice under ration from 380,196 tons in 1966/67 to 310,000 tons in 1967/68. The rise in the local rice subsidy was due chiefly to the higher price of Rs. 14 per bushel of paddy paid to the producer under the Guaranteed Price Scheme since December 1, 1967. There was also a decrease in the issue of local rice under ration from 238,159 tons in 1966/67 to 210,000 tons during 1967/68. This was due to reduction in purchases of local rice by the Commissioner of Agrarian Services from 223,865 tons in 1966/67 to 210,000 tons in 1967/68. This decrease, inspite of the increase in the guaranteed price could be attributed to higher free-market prices, at least in respect of certain varieties of rice. Meanwhile, the distribution expenses and other charges of food items showed an increase of Rs. 15.7 million, Rs. 9.8 million of which was a marine loss.",

This was inspite of an increase in the average landed cost of flour from Rs. 540 to Rs. 597 per ton and of sugar from Rs. 481 to Rs. 544 per ton. The higher profits were due mainly to the increase in the selling price of flour and sugar by 5 cents per pound since November, 1967,2 and in the case of flour, due to an increase in consumption by 37,709 long tons or 9.6 per cent. It is also notewor\u00adthy that the Government which made a profit of about Rs. 3.9 million from sale of other food items (such as lentils) in 1966/67, incurred a loss of Rs. 6.2 million in 1967/68 because of its decision not to pass to the consumer the additional import-cost of lentils consequent on the rupee-devaluation.",

The average annual rate of increase (compound) of such expen\u00additure during the ten years ending September, 1967 was 7.0 per cent, and during the last five years ending September, 1967 was 4.2 per cent. Thus the increase during 1967/68 was appreciably higher than the average increase in recent years. This was mainly due to a Rs. 49.9 million or 14.4 per cent, increase in expendi\u00adture on education and a Rs. 24.2 million or 14-2 per cent increase in expenditure on health during 1967/68. Expenditure on education had increased at an average annual rate (compound) of 8.1 per cent, over the last ten year sand at 4.5 per cent, over the last five years ending September, 1967. Corresponding rates for health had been 5.2 per cent, and 3.5 per cent, respectively. Thus, while the prog\u00adressive annual increases in expenditure on education and health could be attributed to the increased facilities that had to be provided along with the increase in population and in the number of school-going children, the abnormal increase in 1967/68 could be further accounted for by the payment of 'interim' allowances to education and health personnel.",

Capital expenditue thus defined exceeded the figure for 1966/67 by Rs. 91.3 million or 13.0 per cent, as compared to an increase of Rs 104.6 million or 17.5 per cent during the previous year. Over the ten-year period 1957/58 to 1966/67, the annual average rate of increase in capital expenditure was 7.3 per cent (compound). Thus the increase in capital expen\u00additure in 1967/68, although lower than in the previous year, was much higher than the average growth rate achieved in the previous financial years.",

Within the category of economic services, expenditure on agri\u00adcultural and irrigation increased by Rs. 76.7 million (or 43.0 per cent) and manufacture and mining by Rs. 11.3 million (or 7.9 per cent), while expenditure on fisheries and communications declined by Rs. 8.8 million and Rs. 8.2 million respectively.

Within this category, agriculture and irrigation, and manufacture and mining accounted for 32.2 per cent, and 19.4 per cent, respectively, of total capital expenditure in 1967/68.

Within the category of economic services, enhanced provisions have been made in respect of manufacture and mining (Rs. 44.2 million), agriculture and irrigation (Rs. 7.5 million) and communiciations (Rs. 6.3 million). The increased allocations for Government enterprises was due mainly on account of enhanced provisions for the Postal Department and the Railway. Meanwhile, the increased provision for social services was accounted for by increases on housing (Rs. 19.0 million) and on education (Rs. 16.1 million).",

In the previous two years i. e. in 1965/66 and 1966/67, under-expenditure amounted to Rs. 119.7 million or 18.5 per cent, and Rs. 166.6 million or 21.0 per cent, respectively. Thus, the year 1967/68 witnessed a signi\u00adficant improvement in the implementation of the Capital Budget. This may be partly attributed to the greater stress placed in recent times on plan- implementation.",

It should be noted, however, that the increase in the foreign debt in in 1967/68 was partly due to the combined effect of Sterling and Rupee devalu\u00adations in November, 1967, (as will be explained later) which resulted in an appreciation of the rupee value of foreign debt by Rs. 144.4 million. In fact, the increase in the total public debt (both gross and net) in the financial year 1967/68 was substantially higher than the annual increases recorded in previous financial years.",

This was mainly due to a substantial increase in holdings by the Central Bank which more than offset a reduction in holdings by commercial banks. In fact, the Central Bank's holdings increased to Rs. 70 \u2022 0 million in 1967/68 while its holdings during the previous four years had averaged to about Rs. 8-0 million. This increase was 1 mainly due to purchase by the Central Bank of securities from the sinking funds On the other hand, commercial banks have been progressively reducing their holdings since 1963/64.",

The increase amounted to Rs. 306 \u2022 1 million or 41*4 per cent. The corresponding increase during the previous financial year was Rs. 190-5 million or 34-7 per cent. This increase of Rs. 306-1 million in 1967/68 was partly due to the recomputation of Rupee equivalents in respect of foreign loans outstanding, due to the combined effect of the devaluations of the Pound Sterling on November 18, 1967 and the Ceylon Rupee on November 22> 1967.1 Thus, there was an increase of Rs. 1-4 million (\u00a3 106,211) in the external debt due to an upward adjustment of the Rupee value due to the 'gold-content clause' contained in certain aid-agreements, namely, the Polish People's Republic line of credit of Rs. 38-0 million ( \u00a3 2-85 million), the German Democratic Republic line of credit of Rs. 200 \u2022 0 million (\u00a3 15-0 million), and the Yugoslavian line of credit of Rs. 73-3 million ( \u00a3 5 - 5 million).2 Also the devaluation of the Ceylon Rupee, resulted in an enhancement of the Rupee value of the foreign debt by Rs. 143-0 million. Thus, net of these increases due to devaluation of the Sterling and the Rupee, the gross foteign debt increased by Rs. 161.7 million during the financial year ending September, 1968.",

Thus there was a decline in imports under commodity aid of Rs. 30.8 million during the year. In contrast the utilization of commodity aid in 1966/67 increased significantly by Rs. 158.7 million over the previous financial year. It should be noted, however , that the decline in utilisation of commodity aid in 1967/68 understates the real decline in quantum of goods imported due to the devaluation of the Ceylon Rupee.",
