The average monthly level of money supply in 1968 was 6.9per cent higher than in the previous year. This increase in the average monthly level of money supply was slightly higher than the average rate of increase in the years 1959-1965. A significant aspect of money supply in 1968 was 'that it rose less sapidly than real national product, whereas in the period 1959-1965 the rate of increase in money supply was, on the average, in excess of the rate of growth of real product.",

Subsequent to a fall of Rs 15.7 million in January 1968 the money supply maintained almost a constant level in February, but increased by Rs 76.8 million in the next three months mainly under the influence of credit creation to the private sector and, to a somewhat smaller extent, on account of an increase in credit to the Government. In the months of June and July, however, money supply fell by Rs 38.1 million chiefly as a result of a decline in outstanding bank credit to the private sector. The expansionary tendency reasserted itself in August, and, although during the last five months of the year money supply increased by Rs 81.8 million, the average monthly rate of increase during these five months was smaller than that in the three months March-May. The dominant expansionary influence during the latter part of the year was expansion of credit to the private sector.",

This was reflected in an increase in the income velocity of money as measured by the ratio of Gross National Product at current factor cost prices to the money supply. This ratio rose from 4.7 in 1967 to 5.3 in 1968. Further evidence of this development is found in the increase in the turnover rate of demand deposits. After a decline over the past three years, the average monthly turnover rate of demand deposits rose markedly from 1.60 in 1967 to 2.06 in 1968.",

The contractionary effect of the adverse balance of payments was felt throughout the year except in the months of February, July, and September. Time and savings deposits with commercial banks rose continuously during the year except in December.",

    "text": "Over the year as a whole the external sector exerted a substantial contractionary influence on money supply. This was a continuation of the trend which commenced with the deterioration in the country's balance of payments in 1957. The balance of payments deficit on current account in 1968 was considerably bigger than in the previous year. On account of the larger amounts of commodity and project aid received during 1968 the entire increase in this deficit did not need to be financed by a drawing down of external banking assets or an accumulation of external banking liabilities. Thus, although the balance of payments deficit on current account amounted to Rs 346 million, the contractionary effect of this deficit on the money supply was restricted to Rs 115.7 million representing an increase in external banking liabilities, net of a small increase in external banking assets.",

Although the external sector exerted a contractionary effect amounting to Rs. H5.7 million, the expansionary pressures emanating from the financial operations of the government and private sectors were strong enough to offset this contractionary influence. The increase in the Government's indebtedness to the banking system, amounting to Rs. 192.0 million, was smaller than in the previous year and its expansionary impact on money supply was further softened by the accumulation of Rs. 69.4 million in Government's cash balances. The increase in credit to the private sector reached a peak in 1968 at Rs. 264.1 million, but the expansionary effect of this development was limited by the accumulation of time and savings deposits with banks. Thus, in both the internal sources of monetary expansion - viz. the financial operations of the government and private sectors - the high expansion\u00adary potential of credit creation by the banking system was contained by offsetting contractionary influences within these sectors. Taking into account also the contractionary effect of the external sector, the resultant increase in money supply amounted to Rs. 105.6 million during the year.",

    "text": "Another possible explanation for the rise in the use of currency relative to bank deposits after 1966 may lie in the income increases in the rural areas arising from higher production and better prices. Wage payments in the new rural employments and payments for the procurement of paddy and other agri\u00adcultural produce are made predominantly in currency. Although bank deposits by the rural population have increased as a result of a rise in incomes, this increase was only a small proportion of the total increase in deposits in the banking sector indicating the increased use of currency notes as hoardings.",

Of the total increase of Rs. 105.6 million in the money supply, only Rs. 19.3 million represented the increase in demand deposits. Again, while the average end-of-month level of money supply was 6.9 per cent higher than in 1967, the average end-of-month level of demand deposits, at Rs. 827.4 million, was only Rs. 16.3 million or 2.0 per cent higher than in 1967. The turnover rate of demand deposits, howeveT, recorded an unprecedented increase in 1968. The average monthly turnover rate in 1968 was 2.06 as compared to 1.60 in 1967, showing a rise of 28.7 per cent. The monthly turnover rates were consistently greater in 1968 than in the corresponding months of the previous year and were particularly high in the latter half of the year.",

Interest rates paid on these deposits went up in 1967 and in 1968. It is difficult to say to what extent this acted as an incentive to greater saving out of current income, but it is likely to have induced the switching of demand deposits and other financial assets into time deposits. Certain tax concessions which were introduced in 1966 were withdrawn by the 1968/69 budget, but this took effect only from August 1968. It is also significant that there was an expansion in savin's deposits as well as in time deposits of individuals and that rural areas, which experienced an appreciable rise in money incomes, contributed increasingly to this expansion. Pension and provident funds also appear to find time deposits an increasingly attractive form of investment.",

New deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank amounted to Rs. 117.8 million which was nearly Rs. 12 million more than the deposits in each of the years 1966 and 1967. Withdrawals, amounting to Rs. 105.5 million, were almost at the same level as in the two previous years. Thus their turnover rate declined slightly. The improvement in deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank should largely be attributed to the increase in rural incomes. Mention is made elsewhere to a parallel increase in deposits with cooperative societies which function as rural banks.",

There has been a significant growth in both primary and secondary liquid assets of the public in recent years, with a tendency for the latter to increase faster than the former. Changes in the pattern of secondary liquid assets of the public indicate that an increasing proportion of the growth of these assets took the form of claims against the banks as opposed to claims against the Government. The smaller increase in the latter, especially government bonds, is a reflection of the restrained growth in the demand for them, a demand that is confined to institutional investors who need to keep a small portfolio of these less liquid assets or who, like the Insurance Corpora\u00adtion, are statutorily enjoined to invest their surplus funds in government securities. Taking all financial assets of the public together, a characteristic common to developing economies can be observed: with economic development there has been a gradual rise in the ratio of financial assets to national income.",

The restrictions imposed by the Finance Act, 1961 on the open\u00ading of new accounts with banks other than the Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank continued to be effective throughout the year under review. Although an amending Act was passed by Parliament in August enabling the Minister of Finance to approve the opening of accounts with these other banks, up to the end of the year no other bank was approved for this purpose.*",

Thus, while in 1967 the increase in banks' resources arising from the accumulation of the private sector's deposits was utilised to provide increased short-term credit to the Government, in 1968 it was the private sector which utilised by far the larger part of the banks' resources which increased on account of both an increase in the latter's deposits as well as a reduction in Government's indebted\u00adness to the commercial banks. Also in contrast to the previous year com\u00admercial banks did not have increased recourse to borrowing from the Central Bank for resources. In fact banks were in a position to apply part of their increased resources in 1968 towards a reduction of their borrowings from the Central Bank.",

Since a corresponding revision could not be made in the classification of advances as at 31st December, 1967, the magnitudes of changes in some categories of advances shown in Table II (D) 11 should partly be attributed to the impro\u00advement in the statistical classification as at 30th June, 1968. These statistical improvements do not, however, affect the total advances. But it should be noted that the classification cf advances is based more on the type of borrower than on the exact purpose to which such advances may be put to.",

This includes the increase of Rs. 14.7 million in net credit outstanding under the new Agricultural Credit Scheme between the end of December 1967 and 1968. The value of loans granted for the Maha 1968/1969 season and which was outstanding at the end of December 1968, however, was smaller than the value of Maha 1967/68 loans outstanding at the end of December 1967. The increase in credit outstanding between the two dates is explained by the amount of Yala 1968 loans which had not been repaid by the end of the year. The operation of the scheme is described in greater detail in a later section. Besides the increase in credit for the cultivation of paddy and other subsidiary crops under this scheme, there were also increases in credit for other agricultural crops, but credit for tea and rubber cultivation declined slightly during the year. The share of advances for agriculture in total advances, at 10.4 per cent at the end of December, showed very little change from that of the previous December.",

The difficulties of repayment conse\u00adquent on crop failure were treated differently from non-repayment for reasons of negligence or wilful default. Therefore, where delay in repayment was caused by crop damage or failure, the loan was extended for repayment in three equal instalments over the next three seasons. As a result of crop failure 4.9 per cent of loans was extended to be repaid during the three subsequent seasons. When allowance is made for loan extensions the proportion actually in default is 18.2 per cent of the total. Judging from the trend of repayments and the possibility of recovery through rice ration coupons, it is likely that a substantial amount in default would eventually be recovered through rice ration coupons. Although this scheme administered by a commercial bank is not strictly operated on commercial lines the hypothecation of the rice ration coupons as a guarantee against all loans taken ensures a high proportion of recovery.",

However, in other years when the purchases under the Guaranteed Price Scheme were more effective as the guaranteed price was higher than the market price, it was possible to recover loans from G.P.S. payments. This together with corporate responsibility insisted upon between 1953/54 to 1962/63, accounted for a total recovery of 75 per cent of funds lent by the Department of Agrarian Services between 1947/48 to 1966/67. In a context where the guaranteed price for paddy is not higher than the market price and where the insistence of corporate responsibility is considered unfair as non-defaulting farmers are deprived of loans because of their defaulting counterparts, the withholding of rice rations has provided a means of securing a high level of repayment. This is of special significance because the bulk of farmers do not either own land or have proper land title that could be offered as security.",

    "text": "This substantial decrease can be attributed to several reasons. The amnesty given to previous defaulters had increased the number of persons both eligible and willing to borrow in Maha 1967/68 while in Yala 1968, dafaulters of Maha 1967/68 were not eligible to borrow. Some others may have been dissuaded from borrowing owing to the needs for hypo-thecation of rice ration books. It is likely that many borrowers did not expect the Government to insist on the surrender of rice ration coupons till the loan is fully repaid as has been done. Generally, credit needs are less in Yala as farmers commence the season during the period of their highest liquidity. This general phenomenon must have been reinforced more strongly in Yala 1968 by the particularly favourable Maha crop reported in most parts of the country.",

These defaults are mainly concentrated in the two districts of Matara and Hambantota which account for Rs. 0.62 million of default. The default rate in Matara is at present 37 per cent of funds utilised. This was likely to have been caused by the frequent flood damage particularly in the Nilwala ganga basin.

This suggests that the area serviced by loans in the current Maha season is about 70 per cent of the area serviced in Maha 1967/68: This estimate is arrived at on two assumptions. First, that all funds approved would ultimately be utilised and second, that the amount of funds used per acre is in the same proportion in Maha 1968/69 as in Maha 1967/68. This decline is perhaps largely accounted for by the withholding of credit to defaulters.
