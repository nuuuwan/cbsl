Whereas the rise in the prices of certain agricultural products such as potatoes appears to have been emanated by scarcity, the pressure on most other prices seem to have emanated principally from a rise in freight charges in 1967, higher turnover taxes on certain manufactured goods, the devaluation of the Ceylon Rupee in Novem\u00adber 1967, an increase in wages in December 1967, and the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme in May 1968. In many instances, price increases have been the cumulative result of several of the factors men\u00adtioned above.",

The largest increase had occurred in the food group which had risen from 112.7 in 1967 to 121.2 in 1968. In the first six months of the year, the food index according to monthly figures remained fairly stable increasing from 120.1 in December 1967 to only 120.6 in June 1968; it reached a record level of 127.4 in December 1968. Substantial increases were recorded in the prices of certain items of imported origin viz; milk powder, mathe seed, Bombay onions, wheat flour, fennel seed and fresh butter. The rise in these prices is attributable to the increase in the import costs of these commodities due to devaluation and in addition, in the case of butter to the introduction of the FEEC Scheme in May, 1968. Prices of locally produced foodstuffs also registered substantial increases in 1968; thus the prices of turmeric, coconuts and Coconut oil, eggs, chillies, pappadam and potatoes rose. The increase in the price of potatoes was due to the scarcity of this commodity brought about by the ban on imports in May 1967. The increase in the prices of coconut and coconut oil reflected the higher price of oil in world markets during 1968.",

The rise in the price of aerated waters and beverages was partly the result of the increase in the turnover tax from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, in July 1968.

Upward movements in prices were recorded against tobacco, hair dressing and toilet requisites, liquor, newspapers, exercise books and laundry; a slight increase was also recorded against the transport items which was due to the rise in prices of cycle tyres and tubes; moderate reductions were recorded against prices of betel and arecanuts and house-hold goods. The increases in the price of tobacco and liquor reflect the higher excise duty imposed on tobacco and the rise in sale price of coconut arrack. Increased costs of imported raw materials due to the devaluation of the Rupee and the introduction of the FEEC Scheme are likely to have caused the rise in the prices of newspapers and toilet requisites.",

Mild steel and window glass also registered substantial price reductions. These items which were acutely scarce, were selling at unusually high prices prior to May 1968. The introduction of the FEEC Scheme under which the importation of these goods was liberalised was princi\u00adpally responsible for the sharp drop in their prices. An additional factor which had eased the scarcity in the case of cement was the rise in output. Production of cement by the Cement Corporation is reported to have increased by 16 per cent in 1968. The prices of oils and paints registered moderate increases in 1968 due mainly to the increase in the turnover tax in July 1968.",

They are based on the minimum salaries and wages and allowances payable to workers in the representative scales. Overtime and incremental payments, however, are not included in this calculation. Wage rate indices for workers in the private sector are published by the Labour Department using 1952 as the base period. They are given under two categories, viz-, workers in agriculture and workers in industry and commerce. These indices are based on the minimum wage rates fixed by the Wages Boards and from December 1967, the devaluation allowance payable to workers. They do not however, represent actual earnings of the workers which depend on the number of days worked, number of hours worked overtime and other payments such as bonuses.",
