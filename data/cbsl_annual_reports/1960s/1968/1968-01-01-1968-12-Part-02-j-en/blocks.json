As pointed out in the past Annual Reports, there could be considerable differences between the value of imports actually received and cleared from the Customs in any time period and their value as reflected in the Customs entries, from which Customs data are derived, if there was a significant interval between the clearance of imports and the passing of the relative Customs entries. This consideration has particular relevance to Government imports and more particularly to imports of rice, flour and sugar, which account for a considerable proportion of aggregate imports. The extent of the difference between actual imports of these three commodities and their imports as reflected in the Customs recorded data is discussed at some length in the paragraphs that follow. 2- ln terms of U.S. dollars, however, the value of Ceylon's total export earnings in 1968 at $342 million registered a decline of ?13 million as compared with total export earnings in 1967.",

The average price of all exports, which had shown an improvement of 2 per cent in 1965, recorded declines in both 1966 and 1967. The declining trend in the average export price was reversed in 1968 and the average price index of all exports at 101 (Base 1958=100) increased by 19 per cent over the level reached in 1967-The increase in export prices is attributed to the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee. Thus, the sharp increase in the value of exports in 1968 was largely the result of a marked increase in the average price of all exports, the effect of which was strengthened by a small increase in the volume exported.",

The year 1968 too witnessed a further decrease in the total volume of imports and the aggregate volume index at 83 revealed a contraction of 2 per cent, as compared with that for 1967. The average price of all imports, which had been rising steadily from the year 1963, continued its upward trend in the year under review and the Central Bank's Price Index for all imports (Base 1958=100) at 160 registered a sharp increase of 30 per cent over the level reached in 1967. Thus, the marked increase in the value of imports in 1968 was solely the result of a sharp rise in average price of all imports, the effect of which was partially offset by a small decrease in the volume of imports.",

The increase in earnings was entirely due to an increase in the average f.o.b. rupee price realised, the effect of which was partly offset by a decline in the volume exported. The average f.o.b. price of tea which had fallen in the three preceding years rose in the year under review and at Rs. 2.52 per pound was 30 cents per pound or 14 per cent higher than the export price realised in 1967. The volume of tea exported in 1968 at 460 million pounds was 18 million pounds or 4 per cent lower than that in 1967. The share of tea exports in total export earnings at 57 per cent represented a decline of 6 per cent as compared with the percentage contribution in the preceding year.",

The increase over 1966, however, amounted to 6 million pounds or one per cent. The higher level of production in 1968 was due mainly to favourable weather conditions experienced during the second and fourth quarters of the year. A further contributory factor prompting an expansion in overall production may have been the incentive of higher producer prices as compared with the preceding year. Although this observation cannot be firmly established, it is very likely that the effect of persistently higher prices has been towards inducing an expansion in output.1 The higher producer prices resulted from the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee in November 1967. The increase in output was shared by all three elevational categories of tea. As compared with 1967 the respective output of high, medium and low grown teas increased by 2.7 million pounds,",

    "text": "The increase in the market prices of tea, which began in the fourth quarter of 1967, continued during the first three quarters of 1968. The fourth quarter, however, saw declines in the prices of all three elevational categories of teas. This decline in prices can be attributed partly to a seasonal decline in quality and partly to the pressure of heavy supplies, due to increased crops harvested during this period.1 The average nett price of all teas sold at the Colombo Auctions, which had declined by 7 cents per pound or 4 per cent in 1967 over the preceding year registered a sharp increase of 25 cents per pound or 17 per cent to Rs. 1.75 per pound in 1968. This increase in price was shared by all three elevational categories of teas. Although tea prices of all three elevat\u00adional groups rose, there were marked differences in the degree of increase experienced by each individual grade. The average nett price of high-growns increased the least viz., by 11 cents per pound or 6 per cent, while that of medium growns increased by 20 cents per pound or 14 per cent. The sharpest increase, however, was in respect of low-growns, whose average nett price at Rs. 1.63 per pound was 43 cents per pound or 36 per cent higher than that of 1967.

This outcome was in the main due to improved demand from the Middle Eastern buyers, particularly from Iraq. The volume of tea exports to Iraq increased quite markedly in 1968 to 42 million pounds, i.e. an increase of 13 million pounds or 45 per cent as compared with the quantity exported in 1967. The average nett prices in the first three quarters rose by 51 cents per pound, 65 cents per pound and 47 cents per pound, respectively over the corresponding quarters of 1967- However, in the third and fourth quarters prices were lower than in the preceding quarters reflecting a decline in the rate of increase. The average nett price for the fourth quarter at Rs. 1.58 per pound revealed an increase of 9 cents per pound over the same quarter of 1967. The smaller price increases experienced by low-grOwn teas in the third and fourth quarters of 1968 were largely due to restricted purchases from Middle Eastern countries, particularly Iraq in Septem\u00adber and the withdrawal of the Iraqi Government Purchasing Board from the Colombo Market for a period of three weeks from 23rd November.'",

With a view to rendering relief to tea producers, whose costs had risen consequent on the deva\u00adluation, the government re-introduced with effect from January 1968, the tea export duty rebate scheme in a modified form. Initially this scheme provided for all medium and low grown teas sold through the medium of the Colombo Auctions to be paid a rebate amounting to 5 cents per pound. With effect from the sale of 29th October 1968, this rebate scheme was extended to include high-grown teas sold at the Colombo Auctions.",

The average price of all teas sold at this centre at 3 sh. 11.63 d. per pound showed a fall of 2.18 d. per pound as compared with the preceding year. This decline in price con\u00adtrasts with an increase of 0.95 d. per pound recorded in the previous year. There were marked fluctuations in the price of tea during the first half of the year and the average price of all teas sold at this centre in the first half of 1968 at 3 sh. 11.51 d. per pound, registered an increase of 0.38 d. per pound over that of the corresponding period of last year. The price decline, which began in July, continued throughout the second half of 1968. Increased availability of plain teas in a situation of general overproduction, belated arrivals of teas due to strikes in producing countries and such teas losing their freshness, a decline in the overall quality of North Indian teas as compared with that of the last season, an increase in the quantity of teas sold at the London Auctions, the high level of stocks in the U. K. as compared with 1967, and selective buying, were factors which contributed towards prices declining in the London Market.",

    "text": "The average price of all grades of Ceylon tea sold at the London Auctions in the year under review amounted to 4 sh. .1.30 d. per pound registering a decline of 3.03 d. per pound below the preceding year's price. Ceylon teas at the London auctions recorded the highest annual average price as seen in Table II (J) 6. The decline in price was confined to high and medium-grown teas, while the low-grown teas recorded a slight increase. As compared with 1967 the average prices of high and medium-grown teas in 1968 at 4 sh. 2.61 d. per pound and 4 sh. 0.77 d. per pound, respectively, declined by 3.83 d. per pound and 2.36 d. per pound, respectively, while that of low-growns at 3 sh. 7.72 d. per pound increased by 0.51 d.per pound. The strikes in the mercantile sector of the country which inter\u00adrupted the regular arrival of teas, that could have been sold when North Indian offerings were small, as well as the fact that belated arrivals of tea resulted in teas losing their freshness were the major factors responsible for the decline in the average price of Ceylon teas sold at this centre. The decline of 3.03 d. in the average price of Ceylon teas in 1968 was accompanied by declines in the average prices of North Indian and South Indian teas. The average price of North Indian teas at 4 sh. 0.55 d. per pound registered a sharper fall of 5.05 d. per pound as compared with 1967, while the average price of South Indian teas at 3 sh. 6.26 d. per pound recorded a drop of 0.22 d. per pound. The sharp decline in the average London Market price of North Indian teas could be attributed to the general decline in the quality of their second flush teas offered at this centre during the current season.1 In regard to teas from other countries, the prices of tea from Malawi, Mozambique, Argentine and Vietnam recorded increases, while the prices of tea from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritius and Malaya registered declines. The decline in the prices registered by the East African countries was due to the quality of teas offered at this centre being plainer in quality and inferior as compared with the previous year's production.",

The increase in output was due to high yields obtained from replanted areas coming into bearing. However, the production for the period January-October 1968 showed a slight drop of 3.4 million pounds when com\u00adpared with the corresponding period in the preceding year.4 This decline was attributed to the heavy rains that were experienced during the greater part of the year, thereby adversely affecting tapping operations. The production of both sV-eet rubber and crepe rubber increased by 7.4 million pounds and 4.8 million pounds respectively. The local consumption of rubber which increased by 1.0 million pounds in 1967, increased further by 1.3 million pounds to 7.2 million pounds in 1968. The volume of rubber exported which registered a fall of 7 million pounds or 2 per cent in 1967, rose sharply by 37 million pounds or 13 per cent to 328 million pounds in 1968.5 Exports of sheet rubber, crepe (all varieties) and latex increased by 26.4 million pounds (or 16.2 per cent), 10.4 million pounds (or 8.2 per cent) and 0.5 million pounds, respectively.",

This decline in price was temporarily arrested by a short position in Europe in July. With production prospects improving, prices continued to decline and reached their lowest point in October. Yet prices were appreciably higher than those attained in 1967. In November and December, however, prices showed an improvement following reports of typhoon damage in the Philippines.

The higher level of export earnings was due both to an expansion in the volume of coconut exports and to the higher level of prices that prevailed in the inter\u00adnational markets. As compared with 1967, export volumes of copra and desiccated coconut showed increases, while coconut oil recorded a decrease. The volume of exports of copra at 425 thousand cwts. and desiccated coconut at 1,382 thousand cwts., expanded by 109 thousand cwts. or 34 per cent and 456 thousand cwts. or 49 per cent, respectively, while the volume of exports of coconut oil at 1,261 thousand cwts. decreased by 73 thousand cwts. or 5 per cent as compared with 1967. The contraction in the volume of exports of coconut oil may be related to the sharp increase in the price of desiccated coconut which induced a shift from coconut oil to the manufacture of desiccated coconut.",

Although, imports of 'consumer goods' increased by Rs. 147 million or 15 per cent as compared with the preceding year, their share in total imports at 52 per cent declined by 2 per cent. Imports of 'intermediate goods' have shown an expansion of Rs. 188 million or 43 per cent and their share in total imports increased by 4 per cent to 29 per cent, while those of 'investment goods' increased by Rs. 53 million or 16 per cent. The share of 'investment goods' in total imports, however, declined by 1 per cent to 18 per cent in the year under review.",

The value of these imports in 1968 at Rs. 989 million revealed an increase of Rs. 206 milllion or 26 per cent due mainly to amounts recorded in Customs entries relating to government imports of rice, flour and sugar increasing in the aggregate by Rs. 174 million or 34 per cent. The changes in actual imports of these commodities, however, differed from the Customs entries and have been set out in a preceding section. Imports of 'milk and milk products' at Rs. 74 million and 'meat and fish' at Rs. 70 million, increased by Rs. 8 million or 12 per cent and Rs. 14 million or 24 cent, respectively, as compared with the levels reached in 1967. In the latter sub-group a greater part of the increase resulted from increased imports of dried fish. With regard to imports of 'food other' (which includes gram, pulses and currystuffs) the value of imports registered a fall of Rs. 1 million or 1 per cent to Rs. 125 million in 1968. In this sub-group, imports of gram and pluses and dried chillies increased, while imports of onions decreased.",

The volume of petroleum products imported in 1968 amounted to 365 million gallons. The average c.i. f. price per gallon was 52 cents. With the closure of the Suez Canal and the consequent longer route via the Cape and the devaluation of the Pound Sterling freight surcharges were imposed by liner conferences, with the result that average c. i. f. price of petro\u00adleum products from the U. S. S. R. in 1968 increased by 26 cents per gallon to 65 cents per gallon. The share of petroleum imports in total imports at 9 per cent was 3 per cent higher than in the preceding year. Imports of 'fertilizers' too increased in 1968, the value of these imports at Rs- 110 million recording an increase of Rs. 30 million or 38 per cent as compared with the level of imports in 1967. The volume of fertilizer imports in 1968 at 338 thousand tons revealed an expansion of 61 thousand tons or 22 per cent, while the average c.i.f. price at Rs. 326 per ton rose by Rs. 34 per ton or 12 per cent. Imports of 'yarn and thread' increased by Rs. 26 million or 58 per cent to Rs-71 million in 1968. Other notable changes in the category of 'intermediate goods' include increases recorded in the value of imports of 'chemical elements and compounds' 'dyeing, tanning and colouring materials' and 'unmanufactured tobacco' by Rs. 7 million or 18 per cent, Rs. 5 million or 50 per cent and Rs. 4 million or 67 per cent, respectively.

In formulating the foreign exchange budget for 1968 two important policy measures were taken into consideration, viz., the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee in November 1967, and the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme in May 1968. The sources of finances were, export receipts of 1968, commodity aid arrivals expected in 1968, including the spill-over of aid negotiated in 1965, 1966 and 1967.",
