    "text": "Expansion of the milk processing and distribution has been a significant feature of the Board's activities, especially during the last two years. Milk purchases increased by 4.2 million pints (or 22.5 per cent) in 1967 as against an increase of 1.4 million pints in the previous year. During 1968, the purchases increased further by 8.0 million pints (or 35.2 per cent). This notable increase was the result of the increase in the price paid to producers by 10 cents to 45 cents per pint from January, 1967 as an incentive to higher production. It was also due to the fact that the Board was in a position to increase its capacity-utilization consequent on an increased demand for fresh milk arising partly from the scarcity of imported powdered milk. Until recently, milk purchases in certain Centres had to be kept within limits due to deficient demand. Excess milk from these surplus centres were sent to Colombo for processing, and the disposal of this milk was dependant on demand conditions. The setting-up of the Condensed Milk factory also proved useful in absorbing the surplus quantities of milk. Thus, the Milk Board was able to expand its activities considerably since 1967.",

The sales of milk during 1967 and 1968 increased by 2.3 million and 3.6 million pints respectively. This was inspite of an increase in price by 10 cents (average) in January 1967 along with the increase in the price paid to producers. Increased sales were also noticeable in the case of other products of the Board such as ice-cream, yoghurt and curd. Thus, on a higher turnover, the Board was able to reduce its losses in its trading from Rs 1.5 million in 1967 to Rs 0.5 million (provisional) in 1968. The increase in the loss in 1967 over the previous year was due largely to enhanced wage-costs consequent on the payment of \"interim\" allowances. Incidentally, the Board continued to provide school-children with milk at a subsidized price which was 10 cents lower than its market price.",

Having commenced production in March 1968, this factory which has an annual capacity of 25.0 million cans, produced 11.5 million cans up to end of December 1968. Sales, however, were about half the production due to availability in the market of imported condensed milk. Hence, its profit during the year was estimated at Rs. 0.5 million. On full capacity operation and sales, the Condensary will be able to earn a higher profit, but such high profits were only realisable when relatively cheaper imported raw material was used, as was done in 1968. As the Board plans to progressively substitute imported raw materials with local milk from 1969 onwards, it appears that the condensary will not be able to make high profits in the future.",

This was achieved by a further increase in the annual capacity of the factory by 950 tons and by high utilization of capacity for the third consecutive year. According to the performance of the factory during the first 3 quarters of 1968/69 and the Budget for that year the output of 1968/69 might be lower than the previous year's output by about 1,167 tons. This was due to the greater emphasis placed in 1968/69 on the production of Bank and Bond Paper, which were thinner and lighter (but higher priced) than Writing, Prin\u00adting and other paper on the production of which it had concentrated so far. This change was possible due to the accumulation of unsold stocks of the latter variety of paper in recent years.",

At the same time, another sugar factory cum-Distillery with an annual capacity of 19,200 tons of sugar and 750,000 proof gallons of spirits, was established at Hingurana, Gal Ova, which was operated under the then Gal Oya Development Board. Both factories grew their own sugar cane for processing. Following a decision by the government in 1963 to vest the operation of all state-owned sugar industries under one management, the former corporation's name was changed to \"Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation\". The Gal Oya sugar-complex was trans\u00adferred to this Corporation in October 1966 and the planned sugar project at Uda Walawe was handed over in 1968. Thus, at present, the corporation produces sugar, molasses and rectified spirits at Kantalai and Gal Oya, and sugar-syrup on an experimental basis at Uda Walawe.",

    "text": "From its inception, the Kantalai and Gal Oya Sugar factories have operated well below capacity due to the lack of a regular and adequate supply of sugar cane for crushing. This was initially due to a lack of co-ordination between cane cultivation and sugar production, and a shortage of labour for cane cultivation and harvesting. In 1967/68, the output of the Kantalai factory declined to about half of its previous year's output due to an acute shortage of water for sugar cultivation. The Gal Oya factory which had a more reliable supply of water increased its output five-fold during the same year. In 1968/69, the latest available figures indicate a sharp rise in the sugar output at Kantalai and a decline at Gal Oya, attributed entirely to weather conditions. The output of spirits which depends entirely on the molasses output (which is a by-product of sugar manufacture) showed the same trends as in sugar manufacture over the years.",

The cost of production per lb., on the other hand, at Kantalai was about 62 cents in 1966/67 and nearly a rupee in 1967/68. The costs at Gal Oya were even higher. As a result, the Corporation made heavy losses in sugar production, more at Gal Oya than at Kantalai. In contrast, the production of spirits has been a highly profitable venture. The profits from this source dipped in 1967/68 at Kantalai due to lower production, but are expected to improve considerably in 1968/69. At Gal Oya too, an increasing trend in profits from this activity was discernible. The number of employees at Kantalai and Gal Oya (excluding employment at Gal Oya plantation, figures of which are not available) had increased from 2,016 in 1967/68 to 2,333 in December 1968.",

The employment at the corporation increased from 454 in 1966/67 to 1397 in 1967/68 due mainly to the addition of the former Salt deparment staff. In December 1968, however, it had fallen to 1308. The employment at the Corporation fluctuates due to seasonal nature of production.",

The yarn output which increased in 1967/68 is likely to fall in 1968/69. The mill has been operated below capacity since inception. The output of the weaving mill which showed a progressive increase up to 1967/68 is likely to register a slight fall in 1968/69 (although an increase was budgeted for) due mainly to a prolonged strike during the early part of the year and chronic absenteeism. The under utilization of capacity of the Weaving Mill was greater than in the case of the Spinning Mill. On the basis of budgeted increases in production of yarn and textiles, however, the Corporation hoped to enhance its profits substantially by Rs 1.6 million in 1968/69. There was an increase in profit during the previous year too. The low sales-quantity figure (in Table II ( C ) 2 ) is due to the fact that corporation uses a major portion of the yarn it produces at its own Weaving Mill and sells only the surplus. No data are available with regard to its trading activities. The employment at the corporation increased from 1736 at the end of 1967/68 to 2021 at the end of December, 1968.",

The Corporation expected to increase its profits from Rs. 2.0 million in 1967/68 to Rs. 7.8 million in 1968/69 on an anticipated higher sales turnover. Latest available figures however indicate that the corporation may not be able to attain this target in 1968/69 due primarily to",

The former was due partly to the introduction of new sizes in 1968. Again, the corporation operated at well below capacity. In fact, the ratios of capacity-utilization in 1968/69 are expected to be only 24.9 per cent in tyres and 28.4 per cent in tubes. As in the case of steel manufacture, this was attri\u00adbuted to a policy of gradual increase in capacity utilization due to complexities in technology and the growth of demand. The sales, on the other hand, which were sluggish in 1967/68 due to the availability of imported tyres in the market, increased sharply in 1968/69 due to a progressive curtailment of imports. Thus, the Corporation was able to clear much of the previous year's unsold stocks. With the gradual easing of tyre-shortages in the country, the Corporation will have to settle down to more modest increases in sales in the future.",

In 1968/69, the current trends indicate a further increase, but this was due to a 50.0 per cent increase in the fish caught by its own fleet which has been partly set off by a substantial decline in purchases from the trade. On the other hand, the sales appear to be static in 1968/69, while it declined in 1967/68. The increase in the sales of dried fish indicates that a part of the un\u00adsold fish has been diverted there. Nevertheless, the decline in sales was attribu\u00adtable to the fact that the major portion of Corporation's output were achieved in periods when there was an abundance of fish in the local markets. With more evenly spaced out fishing operations, the corporation should be able to achieve higher sales.",

The position might have been worse if the road transport stock had been in a better condition than it is at present (due to the curtailment of imports). In fact, most of the goods traffic carried by the Railway has, as in the recent past, been government and bulk cargoes (such as rice, flour, cement and petroleum products). The ton-mileage of goods, however, has increased during 1967/68 as compared to a decrease in the previous year,2 resulting in an increase in the average length of haul from 127-4 miles to 132.5 miles in 1967/68.

The total expenditure, on the other hand, increased more by Rs. 6.1 million, as against a decline of Rs. 1.9 million in 1966/67. The increase in 1967/68 was due mainly to an increase of Rs. 4.6 million in working expenses attributable partly to increased wages and pensions after the decision to pay \"interim\" allowances (the total wage bill increased by Rs. 0.3 million inspite of a decline in employ\u00adment) and partly to increased operating costs. Thus, while the increase in operational costs cancelled out the increased revenue, the operational deficit of the railway in 1967/68 was the same as in last year. Due to enhanced annuity and interest charges, however, the overall deficit of the railway in 1967/68 showed an increase of Rs. 1.5 million to a sum of Rs. 47-7 million. Incidentally, the total number of employees which declined by 1,215 in 1966/67, declined further by 1,073 during the year under review.",

The former decline was due to reduction in regional and international traffic partly compensated by an increase in internal traffic. The latter increase was due to increases in international and internal transport partly offset by a decline in regional traffic. The passenger-mileage declined by 3,970, due primarily due to a fall in international traffic. The goods ton-mileage, on the other hand, increased by 152 ton-miles due mainly due to a rise in international carriage. The load-factor showed an appreciable increase on the internal and international services, but the total revenue declined by 0.24 million due to increases from regional and internal services being more than offset by declines from international services and other engineering and traffic services for foreign airlines operating through Ceylon. The expenditure increased by Rs. 0 8 million due chiefly to increases in aircraft operation costs. The profit of Air Ceylon, therefore, showed a decline from Rs 3.8 million in 1966/67 to Rs 2.7 million in 1967/68.",

In 1950, a Colombo Port Commission was set up consisting of representatives of major port users and headed by a Port Commissioner.3 The administration of the Colombo port ( and other outports ) was made the responsibility of a government deparment, also called \" the Colombo Port Commission\". The Customs, which was thus separated from port administration, continues to perform functions of collection of duties and prevention of smuggling etc. at the ports. The establishment of another organization, the Port (Cargo) Corporation, in 1958 to handle cargo has resulted in a further division of functions at the port. Hence, it is difficult to disentangle the considerable overlapping of functions, but generally the Port Commission could be deemed to be in overall charge of the maintenance of installations and efficient operation of the ports in Ceylon. It also undertakes coastal protection and construction of fishery harbours, the latter function overlapping with the same function of the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation.",

Of this, Rs. 7 *3 million was accounted for by Trincomalee, while the increase in Colombo was Rs. 13-1 > million or 16-9 per cent. Most of this increase was accounted for by wage costs, which rose by Rs. 15-3 million or 22-6 per cent during 1967/68. Of this, Rs. 5-8 million was in respect of the 2,480 employees enrolled after the nationali\u00adzation of cargo handling at Trincomalee. The increase in the wage bill at Colombo, which rose by Rs.9-2 million or 14* 1 per cent, virtually accounted for the rest. In fact, the total wage bill alone accounted for 82-0 per cent of the expenditure of the entire corporation in 1967/68. During the previous year, the corresponding ratio was 84*0 per cent. This high ratio indicates that the key to the success of port operations in Ceylon lie in the increasing of the productivity of labour which accounts for a major share of cost-The total employment at the Corporation in 1967/68 increased by 2,214 or 12-3 per cent, as against a marginal increase of 182 or 1 - 0 per cent during the previous year. This increase was entirely on account of the new employees at Trincoma. lee, which offset slight declines at Colombo and Galle.",

    "text": "The Corporation's oil imports have fluctuated during the last five years. The increased imports in 1967 was necessiated by the outbreak of hostilities in the Middle-East and the resultant threat to international shipping. Thus, the decrease in imports during 1968 could be attributed to the running down of stocks after the Middle-Eastern crisis abated somewhat. In its domestic sales, however, the corporation has made steady and continuous progress. The increase of only 2.5 million gallons in 1968 as against much higher increases in the previous years could be attributed to the increase in the price of petrol in 1967 (which also resulted in a decline in the sales of supergrade petrol and a slight increase in the sales of the relatively lower-priced ordinary grade petrol). There was a drop in sales of industrial diesel as well. Sales of furnace oil and kerosene have shown a steady increase over years, the former (much used in industries) increasing at a faster rate.",

    "text": "As a result, the income of Corporation too has risen steadily, and in 1968, it rose by Rs 32.5 million to Rs 350.8 million. The expenditure of the Corporation rose more, i.e. by Rs 43.1 million to Rs 346.2 million in 1968. This increase was almost entirely due to an increase in the landed cost of products sold due to the devaluation of the Ceylon Rupee. As a consequence, the Corporation's profit for the year 1968 diminished to Rs 4.6 million as compared with profits of Rs 16.1 million and Rs 23.0 million in 1967 and 1966, respectively. The total employment by the Corporation increased by 300 to 2,515 in 1968. This was largely on account of the new investment activities such as the Refinery and Blending Plant projects.",

By 1964, its activities had expanded to import and sale of essential consumer goods (including a monopoly of dried fish), drugs, fertilizer, transport, printing, exports and even the operation of a petrol filling station. The fertilizer, advertising and drugs departments were closed down during 1964-65. The work handled by the Textile and Export Departments were handed over to two new public-companies, 1 Lanka Salu Sala Ltd., and Consolidated Exports (Ceylon) Ltd., with effect from 1st October, 1967 and 1st January, 1968, respectively. At present, its major activities are in the import and sale of groceries (e.g. sugar and canned fish), cement, hardware and other household requisites.",

In contrast, the expenditure increased at a slower rate. This was due partly to the closing down of certain uneconomical operations, as mentioned earlier. This fact, along with the gradual increase in turnover, resulted in the progressive annual enhancement of its net profits since 1965. The net profit of Rs 58.3 million in 1967 was the highest on record. Of its activities, the major profit-earner has been general trading (which accounted for 89.4 per cent of the total profit) and import and sale of dried fish. Meanwhile, employment showed a steady increase upto 1967, inspite of the closing down of certain activities. Although employment at the end of 1967 increased to 5,581, it declined slightly to 5,505 at the end of 1968.",

It should be noted, however, that these factories were set up and operated more with a view to assisting small scale tea cultivators who had been settled on \"Highland Colonization Schemes\" than with a view to operating at a profit on commercial lines. The employment at these factories in 1967/68 was 246.",

Total income (including value of unclaimed prizes) increased from Rs. 28.9 million in 1966/67 to Rs. 40.0 million in 1967/68. At the same time, expenditure too has risen appreciably. Of the increase in expenditure, Rs. 3.6 million was accounted for by the higher prize-money awarded and Rs. 2.0 million was due to higher cost of administration including commission.",

This was due mainly to a sharp decrease in the arrivals of \"excursionists\" (those who do not stay overnight), consequent on a partial break-down in sea-traffic as a result of the Middle-Eastern war of June 1967. There was, however, a partly compensating increase in arrivals of \"tourists\" (those who stay for one night or more) of 4,697 in 1967 and 4,606 in 1968. There was also a notable increase in \"tourists-nights\" of 57,146 in 1968.",

The Board had estimated the accomodation requirements by 1973 at 1,750 additional rooms. Twelve projects have already been approved to increase accomodation along the coastal areas by 800 rooms and in the ancient cities by 100 rooms. This programme is expected to be completed by 1973. The development of a tourist resort of 100 acres at Bentota and 10 acres at Polonnaruwa has already commenced.",
