The increase in the value of export receipts from coconut products was due to an unprecedented expansion in the volume of exports, which as measured by the export volume index rose from 109 in 1960 to 154 in 1961 (or by 41 per cent). In contrast there was no revival in the prices of coconut products. Indeed these continued to fall from the already low levels reached at the end of the previous year.

Notwithstanding a reduction in export receipts in 1961 there was yet a small trade surplus of Rs. 30 million in that year. This result was achieved largely by the severe import restrictions that were introduced in January 1961. For some years past, the value of imports had increased nearly uninterruptedly reaching a record level of Rs. 2005 million in 1959 and then declined slightly to Rs. 1960 million in the following year. In 1961 the index of import volumes contracted sharply from 113 in 1960 to 91 in 1961. The contraction in import volumes occurred in each of the three categories of imports; consumer goods, intermediate goods and investment goods. The sharpest contraction was in the group \"other consumer goods\" which in 1961 was a little less than a third of the volume in I960. While export prices in 1961 had deteriorated steadily there was no compensating improvement in import prices. The price index for all imports fell very slightly from 102 in 1960 to 101 in 1961. consequently the terms of trade deteriorated in 1961 to 94 as against 102 in 1960;",

    "text": "of 1961 remained somewhat higher than in the previous year. However, during the third quarter prices were somewhat lower than a year earlier. Towards the end of the year, more particularly in the fourth quarter, Colombo auction prices were substantially below those in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The decline in the price of tea as compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year was partly due to the failure to maintain the seasonal im\u00adprovement in quality, which takes place at this time. It was also and perhaps to a greater measure, the result of the large increase in global supplies that were available at that time. Thus high grown teas which largely account for quality fell in price from Rs. 2.15 per lb. in the last quarter of 1960 to Rs. 1.94 per lb., in the last quarter of 1961. The fall in the price of the other teas was more severe; both medium and low grown teas which were selling at an average price of Rs. 1.87 per lb. in the fourth quarter of 1960 fetched only Rs. 1.52 per lb., in the fourth quarter of 1961. However, as a result of the relatively attractive prices during the first half of 1961 the average price of tea for the year as a whole was only moderately lower in 1961; in 1960 the average price of all tea at. the Colombo auctions was Rs. 1.88 and in 1961 Rs. 1.83. The price of all tea in the United Kingdom followed broadly the trend of the Colombo auctions, for in the first half of the year prices of all tea in London were higher than in the corrresponding half of the previous year; the deterioration in price in London occurred in the second half of 1961 repeating the pattern that prevail\u00aded in Colombo.",

    "text": "1961, covering in many instances the first three quarters of that year, the consumption of natural rubber was less than in the corresponding period of 1960 among major users such as the U. S. A., United Kingdom and China. The decline in consumption in these countries as well as by other major consumers in Western Europe has not been fully offest by increases in purchases reported in respect of Eastern European countries. The continuing low level of prices for rubber resulted in the reduction of export duty in February, from 30 cents per lb. to 20 cents per lb. Towards the end of the year the Government was actively considering the enforcement of a sliding scale of export duties for rubber, which was introduced with effect from November 26, 1961. The export duty is fixed weekly on the basis of the London price of sheet rubber Grade I for the prece\u00adding week, converted to an estimated f. o. b. Colombo price for that grade. The minimum duty of 1 cent is payable when the estimated Colombo price is 94 cents per lb. Thereafter the duty increases progressively with a greater incidence in the higher range of price. Thus at Rs. 1.23 per lb. the duty is 14 cents, and at Rs.1.68, 41 cents. The highest duty of Rs. 1.05 is payable when the price is Rs. 2.44 per lb.",

In August I960, a combination of tariff, import and credit restrictions were imposed largely on these imports and, by the end of the year imports of these categories indicated signs of falling away. Thus in the fourth quarter of I960 the volume of. these imports were 42 per cent lower than the average quarterly rate for the three preceeding quarters of that year. Restric\u00adtions that had been imposed in August, I960 were extended early in January 1961, and the combined result of the resrictions led to severe reductions in these imports.",

In addition to these consumption imports, imports of textiles accounted for a substantial proportion of the import bill. Though the value of textile imports had fallen moderately from Rs. 152 million in 1960 to Rs. 135 million in 1961, yet in the latter year they accounted for as much as 7.9 per cent, of the total import bill as against 7.8 per cent a year earlier and 7.4 per cent two years ago.",
