These trends indicate, not only that past invest\u00adment is slowly beginning to mature in both the public and private sectors, leading to a gradual expansion and diversification of the industrial base, but also, that there is a certain strengthening of the infra structure, needed for industrial development and a new interest in the starting of industries by the private sector.",

    "text": "In the public sector the working of existing corporations was reviewed by the Government during the course of the year and several steps were taken, following the review, to improve the efficiency of the corporations. Firstly, a number of corporations were re-grouped and the management was brought under a single administrative unit in order to overcome the problems of managerial shortages and to effect economies in overhead expenditures, e.g., the amalgamation of the Paranthan Chemicals and the Salt Corporations. Secon\u00addly, in certain instances, additional foreign and local expertise has been brought in to strengthen the existing management structure, e. g., the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation. Thirdly, almost all the existing corporations have been reorganised with a view to increasing production and in certain cases expansion programmes have been prepared or implemented. Fourthly, the Government itself has been exercising a closer inspection of activities of the corporations in order to ensure that production and other targets are being adhered to. As a result of these measures many of the older corporations have now expanded output and have begun to show operational profits.",

    "text": "A significant development in cement production is the implementation of an expansion programme. This expansion programme has three stages: (1) establishment of a second kiln at the existing site in Kankesanturai; (2) a klinker grinding plant at Galle, and (3) establishment of another cement factory at a third site, near Puttalam where suitable raw materials are available. The cost of the first two stages would amount approximately to Rs. 40 million to be obtained through a credit from the West German Government. The average annual production of cement has been about 80,000 tons which could meet about one-third of the present domestic requirements. With the completion of the expansion programme of the existing plant, production will increase to 250,000 tons. Another 200,000 tons will be produced by the second plant when it is: completed. The second plant will cost Rs. 50 million, for which the possibility of further credit from foreign sources is being explored.",

Industrial development in Ceylon could also be furthered as a result of Ceylon's membership in the International Development Association, in June 1961. The International Development Asso\u00adciation was established as an affiliate of the I.B.R.D. to assist in channelling additional external finance and technical assistance to meet important devel\u00adopment projects in under-developed countries, on terms which are more flexible and bear less heavily on the balance of payments than those of conventional forms of assistance. The initial subscription allocated to Ceylon is $ 3.03 million.",
