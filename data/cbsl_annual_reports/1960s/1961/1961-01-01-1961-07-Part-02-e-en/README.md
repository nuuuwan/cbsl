Central Bank

to The reduction in the size of the deficit in the balance of payments in 1961 reflected itself in an improvement in the rate of decline in the International Reserve of the Central Bank. In 1961, the International Reserve fell by Rs. 3.9 million or 2.0 per cent as compared to a fall of Rs. 196*5 million or 50'8 per cent in 1960. The magnitude of the total international reserve in December 1960 was Rs. 1902 million By May 1961 the international reserve had risen to Rs. 268'8 million, and thereafter fell fairly steadily to Rs. 184.7 million at the end of Decem­ber 1961. The sharp increase in the international Reserve of the Central Bank in April 1961 is the result of an increase in external assets in February and March resulting from a favourable balance of trade and also the purchase of foreign exchange of Rs. 53*8 million from the International Monetary Fund. The average level of the international reserve in 1961 was Rs. 205'5 million as against the average of Rs. 295*9 million in 1960.

The domestic assets of the Central Bank continued to increase sharply parti­cularly on account of credit made available to the Government to finance its . deficit. Central Bank advances to Government rose by Rs. 20.1 million in 1961 as compared to a rise of Rs. 21.9 million in 1960. These advances are now at the maximum possible limit, since Government borrowing from the Central Bank in the form of advances is limited to 10 per cent of the estimated revenue of the current financial year. The Central Bank's holdings of Government and Government guaranteed securities rose steadily during the year, from Rs. 568;7 million in December 1960 to Rs. 678.1 million in November 1961 an increase of Rs. 109.5 million.

Throughout the year except in the months of January and February 1961, the reserve position of the commercial banks continued to be low as in the previous year. After August 1961 the commercial banks carried no excess reserves and had from time to time to seek accommodation from the Central Bank. Commercial bank borrowing from the Central Bank was at a reasonably steady level during the second half of the year.

Reference has already been made to the increase in the currency component of the money supply during the last few years. This increase, was more marked in 1961 than in the previous year. In 1960 total currency issue rose from Rs. 621.3 million to Rs. 644.6 million an increase of Rs. 23.3 million. In 1961 the corres­ponding increase was from Rs. 644.6 million in December 1960 to Rs. 718.3 million in November 1961 or by Rs. 73.7 million. The sharpest increase in the currency issue occured during the month of April when it rose from Rs. 631.0 million in January 1961 to Rs. 749.2 million. Thereafter the currency issue fell and rose steadily in the last quarter of 1961 to the level at which it stood in November. The April increase in the issue was a temporary increase which was associated with the dislocation of normal banking services as a result of a dispute between the commer­cial banks association and the bank employees. The commercial banks deposits with the Central Bank fell from Rs. 140.3 million in December 1960 to Rs. 102.8 million in November 1961. These deposits declined steadily throughout the year except for a minor upward fluctuation in April and in September 1961. The fall in these deposits also reflects the tightening of the liquidity position of the commer­cial banks, largely as a result of higher reserve requirements which the banks were

( 78 )

required to maintain as from 1st February, 1961. Deposits of international orga­nisations and other'liabilities rose by Rs. 69.5 million and Rs. 13.6 million respec­tively. On account of the increase in the total currency issue and other demand liabilities and the fall in the international reserve, the ratio of the international reserve, to currency and demand liabilities fell from 22.2 per cent in December 1960 to 19.5 per cent in November 1961. This is the lowest recorded ratio ot international reserve to currency and demand liabilities.

Credit Policy

The Annual Report for 1960 outlined a series of measures which the Central Bank adopted in that year mainly with a view to dealing with the rapid fall in the country's external assets. These measures were largely of a selective nature and were designed to restrict the volume and cost of credit for the purchase and importation of certain specified luxury and semi-luxury goods. These measures were further re-inforced by an increase in the Central Bank's rate of interest on advances from 2\ to 4 per cent. In order that the increase in the bank rate may not raise the cost of commercial bank credit for essential trade and production purposes the Central Bank's lending rates to commercial banks against the pledge of usance promissory notes relating to certain transactions was fixed at 1\ per cent and these trans-actions were separately specified. On January 26, 1961 the special rate at which the Central Bank granted advances to the commercial banks against pledge of usance promissory notes for these specified transactions was raised from ' 1\ to 4 per cent per annum. The Central Bank found that there were no advan­tages in having a lower rate for essential transactions and a higher rate for non essen­tial transactions because of the possible leakage of credit from one category of trans­action to another. It was therefore decided to unify the rate and have a flat rate

of 4 per cent for Central Bank accomodation to the commercial banks secured by the pledge of government securities. At the same time the ceiling rate of 6 per cent on commercial bank advances to customers for certain specified purposes which had been introduced simultaneously with the increase in Bank rate in 1960 was also withdrawn from the same date.

With a view to making available credit for the purchase, sale or storage of locally grown agricultural products, with effect from August 1961, the Central Bank made advances to commercial banks at the concessionary rate of 3 per cent against the pledge of usance promissory notes of co-operative societies.

In view of the growth of the liquidity of the commercial banks particularly in the last four months of 1960 and in January and February 1961 the Central Bank introduced measures to immobilise a good part of the excess reserves of the commer­cial banks. With effect from 10th February, 1961 commercial banks were required to maintain special reserves equal to 38 per cent of any increase in their demand deposit liabilities over the level of such liabilities as at February 1, 1961. These special reserves were required to be maintained in addition to the current statutory reserve requirments of 12 per cent against demand deposits. No special reserves were required to be maintained against time and savings deposits and the existing reserve ratio of 5 per cent remained unchanged..

( 79 )

To relieve the commercial banks of the strain on their liquidity position which resulted from the higher reserve requirments, from July onwards banks were permitted to maintain required reserves partly in the form of rupee deposits in the Central Bank and partly in Ceylon currency notes and coins held by such banks. Initially not more than 50 per cent (which was increased to 75 per cent in September)

of the required reserves could be maintained in the form of currency notes and coins and the balance in the form of rupee deposits in the Central Bank. The term "currency notes and coins" referred only to the increase in the holdings of a commercial bank's currency notes and coins over its holdings as at the close of business on March 15th, 1961.

Commercial Banks

The People's Bank which was established on July 1, 1961, opened branches in the following towns: Polonnaruwa, Hingurakgoda. Hambantota, Anuradhapura, Puttalam, Matale and Kandy; thus increasing its number of offices outside Colombo

to 7. Four of its new branches were established at places where previously no banking facilities were available. The Bank of Ceylon opened one branch in

Colombo thus increasing the number of its offices to 27. The total number of banking offices at the end of 1961 was 54 of which 20 were in Colombo. The

Total deposits of the commercial banks fell by Rs. 15.9 million from Rs. 1,057.1 million to Rs. 1,041.2 million in November 1961 as compared to an increase of Rs. 64.0 million from Rs. 993.1 million to Rs. 1,057-1 million in 1960. However, the monthly average of total deposit liabilities was higher in the first 11 months of 1961 than in 1960, being Rs. 1,037.6 million in 1961 and Rs. 997.5 million in 1960. There was a fall both in demand deposits and time and savings deposits. The former falling from Rs. 684.9 million to Rs. 681.0 million in November 1961 and the latter from Rs. 372.2 million to Rs. 360.2 million. 'Proportionatelyt

the fall in the time and savings deposits (3.2 per cent) was greater than that of demand deposits (0.6 per cent). In October 1961 most banks raised their maxi­mum rates on savings deposits to 1\ per cent. Effective in the latter half of Sep' tember 1961 some of the banks also raised their rates on fixed deposits to 3 per cent on amounts of Rs. 25,000 and over. The increase in savings deposits in October and November 1961 may be largely attributable to these higher rates.

Total deposits increased from Rs. 924.9 million in September 1960 to Rs 925.9 million in March 1961 and Rs. 927*2 million in September 196 J. The net increase of Rs. 2.3 million in these deposits was mainly in respect of demand and savings deposits whereas time deposits have fallen. The increase in demand deposits was mainly those belonging to business concerns and local authorities. With regard to the time deposits those belonging to local authorities have increased sharply while those in the category "other business" have fallen sharply; time deposits of individuals have also risen. Except for the savings deposits of indivi­duals, other categories of savings deposits shown in Table 11—35 have changed little. Mainly on account of the credit restrictions introduced by the Central Bank and the quantitative controls on imports by Government in August 1960, total loans and advances of commercial banks fell from Rs. 556.9 million in August

1960 to Rs. 543.9 million in December. However, in January 1961 they had risen to Rs. 559*5 million. But after a fall of approximately Rs. 10 million in February they rose steadily in March and April 1961. The biggest increase occured in April

1961 when total loans and advances rose from Rs. 560.9 million in March to Rs. 589.3 million. Thereafter there has been a certain amount of fluctuation. At the end of August 1961 total loans and advances were at Rs. 560*8 million or at a slightly higher level than in August, 1960. The monthly average level of loans and overdrafts was higher in 1961 being Rs. 434.6 million as against Rs. 429.7 million in 1960. Total overdrafts fell by Rs. 5.1 million in Decmber 1960 to Rs. 289*6 million in November 1961. Loans fell by Rs. 10 million from Rs. 138.1 million in 1960 to Rs. 128.1 million in November 1961. Export bills rose by Rs. 9.7 million from Rs. 55.4 million to Rs. 65.1 million and import bills from Rs. 53.3 million to Rs.53.8 million. The sharp increase in loans and overdrafts in March and April could be partly attributed to the disorganisation of banking services resulting from a dispute between the commercial banks and their employees. During this dispute since commercial banking operations were confined mainly to the encash­ment of cheques the banks had to extend the credit limits of constituents who had already taken overdrafts from them; thus it will be seen that the increase in tota loans and advances was mainly in respect of overdrafts which rose from Rs. 299.8 million in February to Rs. 321.7 million in April 1961. The increase in loans and overdrafts in January over the December 1960 figure is partly due to the Improvement in excess reserve and the liquidity position of the commercial banks in this period and to several banks converting overdrafts into loans to enable themselves to borrow from the Central Bank at the concessionary rate of 1\ per cent against usance promissory notes in terms of Section 82 (1) of the Monetary Law Act. After this facility was withdrawn in February 1961 commercial banks ceased to follow this practice and the loans fell slightly thereafter.

Whereas in the previous year cash on hand fell by Rs. 4.2 million from Rs. 43.5 million in December 1959 to Rs. 39.3 million in December 1960, in

( $ 3 )

1961 these cash balances increased by Rs. 8.2 million to Rs. 47.5 million in November 1961. Balances with the Central Bank fell sharply by Rs. 32.5

«3 million from Rs. 136.8 million to Rs. 104.3 million in November 1961. This must be contrasted with the marked increase of Rs.44.5 million 1960. The fall in the balances with the Central Bank is in part due to the reduction in the quantum of excess reserves in the banking system and in part to the overall contraction in the volume of demand and time and savings deposits. The banks' holdings of foreign balances fell by Rs. 11.0 million from Rs. 56.3 million to Rs. 45.3 million as compared with an increase of Rs. 5.4 million from

Rs. 50.9 million to Rs. 56.3 million in 1960. The commercial banks' holdings of treasury bills increased markedly by Rs. 22.1 million from Rs. 47.9 million in December 1960 Rs. 70.0 million in November 1961. Average holdings during the year were Rs.49.9 million as against Rs.28.5 million in the previous year. The commercial banks' portfolio of Government securities increased by Rs. 5.0 million from Rs. 287.5 million in December 1960 to Rs. 292.5 million in November 1961. In the previous year holdings of Government securities increased by Rs. 4.0 million to Rs. 287.5 million. Bills purchased and discounted rose from a monthly average of Rs. 114.7 million in 1960 to Rs. 121.9 million in 1961

Of the individual components of this item export bills rose by Rs. 9.7 million from Rs. 55.4 million in December 1960 to Rs. 65.1 million in November 1961. whereas import bills rose slightly from Rs. 53.3 million to Rs. 53.8 million during the same period.

Total liquid assets rose from an average of Rs. 333.3 million in 1960 to Rs. 375 million in the 11 months ending November 1961. The ratio of liquid assets to demand deposits rose slightly by 0.4 per cent from 57-2 per cent in 1960 to 57.6 per cent in November, 1961.

Excess reserves which stood at Rs. 39.5 million in December, 1960 fell steadily over the first 7 months of 1961. From August onwards the banks held no excess reserves. In January and February 1961 the banks held substantial excess reserves, but with the introduction of special reserve requirements effective 10th February, 1961 these excess reserves were considerably reduced. The increase in the excess reserves of the commercial banks from September 1960 onwards up to February 1961 was mainly the result of the monetary measures introduced in 1960 which tended to immobilise a portion of commercial bank resources.

Inter-bank borrowings in 1961 were considerably higher than in the previous year. Due to the fall in their liquidity position several commercial banks had to borrow regularly in the market. The average level of inter-bank indebtedness in 1961 was Rs. 40.4 million as against Rs. 36.9 million in 1960. Although the level of inter-bank borrowing remained steady during the year the inter-bank call loan rate remained unchanged at 2 per cent.

The analysis of bank advances to the private sector during the year ended 30th September 1961 is based on the continuing half-year\y survey.

Up to March 1961 several banks were able to finance the increase in their loans and advances by utilising their excess reserves. After March, however, in order to meet increased credit requirements most banks had to borrow from the Central Bank. These borrowings have remained substantial throughout the year except in the months of October and November. Even in the months

of January and February when the banking system as a whole had excess reserves, individual banks had to borrow from the Central Bank. This was mainly due to the uneven distribution of excess reserves between the various banks. The following figures show the extent to which the Central Bank accommodated the commercial banking system from January, 1961.

In the period ending 30th September 1960 total advances fell by Rs. 2.3 million from Rs. 560-9 million to Rs. 558.6 million. The largest decrease in the component items of this total were in financial advances which fell by Rs. 13.2 million from Rs. 101.6 million to Rs. 88.4 million in September 1961. Advances for consumption fell by Rs. 4.9 million from Rs. 35.1 million to Rs. 30.2 million and "other" advances by Rs. 0.8 million from Rs. 8.6 million to Rs. 7.8 million. On the other hand advances for commercial purposes increased by Rs. 7.6 million fromRs. 385.1 million to Rs. 392.7 million, those for agricultural purposes from Rs. 10.4 million to Rs. 10.8 million. Industrial advances showed a significant increase of Rs.8.6 million from Rs.20.1 million to Rs. 28.7 million. Credit given for financial purposes relates generally to advan­ces to hire purchase companies and other firms for the purpose of financing a fairly wide range of transactions such as the purchase of new and second hand

The table below shows the classification of advances by purpose and according to maturity.

motor vehicles; durable consumer goods and also certain other types of essen­tial equipment such as tractors, plant and machinery. Consumption loans are mainly those given directly by the commercial banks to their constituents for the purpose of either purchasing durable consumption goods or financial assis­tance for various contingencies and loans of a purely personal nature. The fall in the categories of advances for financial and consumption purposes is mainly due to the restrictions which were introduced on the availability of credit for hire purchase transactions and for other non-essential purposes. The increase in the volume of advances for commercial purposes has been largely due to the expan­sion in the volume of credit to the export trade. The increase in advances for agricultural and industrial purposes shows that the banks are now diverting a slightly larger proportion of their resources than previously for these purposes.

Of the total volume of bank advances given to the private sector, 70.3 per cent was utilised for commercial purposes, i.e. mainly for financing the move­ment of agricultural produce; 158 per cent for financial purposes; 19 per cent for the direct financing of agricultural enterprises; 5-1 per cent for industrial pur­poses; and 5-4 percent for consumption. "Other" advances constituted 1*4 per cent of the total. These figures show that the overall volume of direct bank financing of agricultural and industrial enterprise in the private sector continued to remain at a very low level while the bulk of the resources of the banking system was utilised to provide credit to the export and import trade. The following table classifies advances by type of security based on the half yearly survey.

Between September 1960 and September 1961 the distribution of advances according to the type of security as compared with the corresponding period before has not shown any significant change except that the percentage of unsecured advances has risen by 4.6 per cent from 7.7 per cent to 12.3 per cent Advances secured by time and savings and other cash deposits have increased

( 87 )

slightly by 0.8 per cent from 2.9 per cent to 3.7 per cent while advances against documentary bills have risen by 3.3 per cent from 23.3 per cent to 26.6 per cent. The fall of 4.7 per cent from 15.8 per cent to 11.1 per cent in advances secured by "other" types of paper reflects the fall in the' volume of bank advances which had been secured by hire purchase paper.

Although there were no official changes in the commercial banks' lending rates the above table shows that the banks as a whole have adjusted their len­ding policies to the higher Bank rate and market rates which became operative in the previous year. Whereas in September 1960 approximately 30 per cent of the total advances outstanding were given at 4 | per cent, in September 1961 only 3.4 per cent of the advances was made available at this rate. On the other hand in September 1961 50.8 per cent'of advances outstanding were given at 6 per cent as against 26.9 per cent in Setember 1960. Of the total amount approximately 86 per cent of bank advances were at interest rates of 6 per cent and above, as compared with 49 per cent in the period before September, 1960.

Bank clearings changed little from a monthly average of Rs. 743.0 million in 1960 to Rs. 742.8 million in 1961. The interest rates charged by commer­cial banks except those on savings deposits which were referred to earlier, remained unchanged throughout the year. Except for an increase in the treasury bill rate of 0.04 per cent in February 1961 when the rate rose from 2.64 percent in January, 1961 to 2.68 per cent, the rate remained at the latter figure during the rest of the year.

Total savings deposits in the commercial banks, Ceylon Savings Bank, Post-Office Savings Bank and Savings Certificates outstanding decreased by Rs. 16.4 million as compared to a rise of Rs. 78.6 million in 1960. This decrease in the quantum of savings occurred in the Post Office Savings Bank, Ceylon Savings Bank and commercial banks whereas Savings Certificates outstanding increased slightly. Deposits at the Ceylon Savings Bank fell by Rs. 1.8 million as against an increase of Rs. 2.3 million in 1960. Deposits at the Post Office Savings Bank fell by Rs. 3.1 million as against a rise of Rs. 22.5 million in 1960. This fall in the volume of savings deposits has occurred at a time when demand deposits have also fallen considerably. The fall in the savings deposits may be partly attributed to the decline in export incomes during the year and the fall in incomes in general arising out of the level of activity in that sector.

The increase in the collections of the Employees' Provident Fund was less marked in 1961 than in 1960. The receipts in the Fund increased by Rs. 1.2 million from Rs. 55.8 million to Rs. 57.0 million in 1961. The small increase in the total collections for 1961 as against 1960 is due to the fact that in the current year very few new employments were brought into the Fund and in 1960 considerable coverage had already been given to existing employments.

Total loans and equities outstanding of the Development Finance Cor­poration of Ceylon rose by Rs. 3 million from Rs. 18 million in 1960 to Rs. 21 .million in December 1961. The .bulk of these investments consisted of loans directly granted to the borrowers. Equity investments in development projects amounted to Rs. 0.3 million in 1961. With regard to the lending operations of the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation, after a slight increase in January 1961, loans have tended to decrease. Total loans outstand­ing at the end of November 1961 was Rs. 30.7 million as against Rs. 31.7 million in December 1960. Between January and June 1961 total loans fell by Rs. 0.4 million as compared with an increase of Rs. 0.2 million in the same period in 1960. The Corporation has made all its new loans out of capital repayments as there has been no net increase in the volume of resources avai­lable for lending. One of the reasons for the fall in volume of new loans of the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation has been the extension of maturit­ies on existing loans because of the fall in commodity prices and on other restric-

( 89 )

tions introduced on the availability of credit. With the extension of the maturities on these loans the repayments which were normally utilised for the making of new loans have fallen substantially. Another reason for the fall in the volume of credit given by the Corporation has been the adoption of a more restrictive lending policy and a closer examination of the purpose for which loans are required. It has introduced a policy of scrutinising more closely loans which are not directly required for purposes of industrial and agricul­tural development. As a result of this policy applications from clients who normally seek financial assistance from the Corporation for purposes such as transfer or sale of property from one person to another have tended to decrease.

Loans outstanding of the State Mortgage Bank at the end of 1960/61 was Rs. 57.0 million as compared with Rs. 56.1 million at the end of 1959/60, an increase of Rs. 0.9 million. The State Mortage Bank has been able to finance its new loans not only out of capital repayments but also by the issue of deben­tures. During the year the State Mortage Bank issued debentures for Rs. 5 million carrying an interest rate of 4J per cent.

In 1961 the Insurance Corporation of Ceylon made preliminary arrange­ments with a view to commence business on 1st January 1962. The Corpora­tion is now the sole underwriter of new life insurance business in the country in addition to underwriting all other types of insurance business. An Act entitled an Act to control Insurance Business in Ceylon was presented in Parliament with the object of regulating the operations of the existing insurance companies who are engaged in both life and general business in the country.

A Bill for the establishment of the Peoples' Bank became law on 30th May 1961 and the Bank commenced operations on 1st July 1961. The Peoples' Bank replaces the Co-operative Federal Bank and has a considerably wider scope and range of functions than the latter. The Act gives the Bank very wide powers. It is empowered to undertake commercial banking business on-the lines now undertaken by the Bank of Ceylon in addition to the wide range of new functions which include the provision of credit at short and medium and long term to agriculture and industry in the rural and other sectors. The purpose of the Bank according to,the Peoples' Bank Act No. 29 of 1961 is to develop the co-operative movement of Ceylon, rural banking and agricultural credit by furnishing financial and other assisance to co-operative societies, approved societies, cultivation committees and other persons.

The budget speech of the Finance Minister included proposals for the nationalisation of the Bank of Ceylon. Since its establishment in 1939 the bank has been partly owned by private share holders and partly by government. With the nationalisation of the Bank government will purchase the shares now held by the public and thereafter the entire share capital of the Bank will be owned by Government. Before nationalisation, in addition to the Secretary to the Treasury the Government nominated two representatives on the Board of Directors, while the other Directors, were elected by the share holders. After nationalisation all the Directors were appointed by the Government.
