    "text": "to The reduction in the size of the deficit in the balance of payments in 1961 reflected itself in an improvement in the rate of decline in the International Reserve of the Central Bank. In 1961, the International Reserve fell by Rs. 3.9 million or 2.0 per cent as compared to a fall of Rs. 196*5 million or 50'8 per cent in 1960. The magnitude of the total international reserve in December 1960 was Rs. 1902 million By May 1961 the international reserve had risen to Rs. 268'8 million, and thereafter fell fairly steadily to Rs. 184.7 million at the end of Decem\u00adber 1961. The sharp increase in the international Reserve of the Central Bank in April 1961 is the result of an increase in external assets in February and March resulting from a favourable balance of trade and also the purchase of foreign exchange of Rs. 53*8 million from the International Monetary Fund. The average level of the international reserve in 1961 was Rs. 205'5 million as against the average of Rs. 295*9 million in 1960.",

In 1960 total currency issue rose from Rs. 621.3 million to Rs. 644.6 million an increase of Rs. 23.3 million. In 1961 the corres\u00adponding increase was from Rs. 644.6 million in December 1960 to Rs. 718.3 million in November 1961 or by Rs. 73.7 million. The sharpest increase in the currency issue occured during the month of April when it rose from Rs. 631.0 million in January 1961 to Rs. 749.2 million. Thereafter the currency issue fell and rose steadily in the last quarter of 1961 to the level at which it stood in November. The April increase in the issue was a temporary increase which was associated with the dislocation of normal banking services as a result of a dispute between the commer\u00adcial banks association and the bank employees. The commercial banks deposits with the Central Bank fell from Rs. 140.3 million in December 1960 to Rs. 102.8 million in November 1961. These deposits declined steadily throughout the year except for a minor upward fluctuation in April and in September 1961. The fall in these deposits also reflects the tightening of the liquidity position of the commer\u00adcial banks, largely as a result of higher reserve requirements which the banks were",

    "text": "The Annual Report for 1960 outlined a series of measures which the Central Bank adopted in that year mainly with a view to dealing with the rapid fall in the country's external assets. These measures were largely of a selective nature and were designed to restrict the volume and cost of credit for the purchase and importation of certain specified luxury and semi-luxury goods. These measures were further re-inforced by an increase in the Central Bank's rate of interest on advances from 2\\ to 4 per cent. In order that the increase in the bank rate may not raise the cost of commercial bank credit for essential trade and production purposes the Central Bank's lending rates to commercial banks against the pledge of usance promissory notes relating to certain transactions was fixed at 1\\ per cent and these trans-actions were separately specified. On January 26, 1961 the special rate at which the Central Bank granted advances to the commercial banks against pledge of usance promissory notes for these specified transactions was raised from ' 1\\ to 4 per cent per annum. The Central Bank found that there were no advan\u00adtages in having a lower rate for essential transactions and a higher rate for non essen\u00adtial transactions because of the possible leakage of credit from one category of trans\u00adaction to another. It was therefore decided to unify the rate and have a flat rate",

The net increase of Rs. 2.3 million in these deposits was mainly in respect of demand and savings deposits whereas time deposits have fallen. The increase in demand deposits was mainly those belonging to business concerns and local authorities. With regard to the time deposits those belonging to local authorities have increased sharply while those in the category \"other business\" have fallen sharply; time deposits of individuals have also risen. Except for the savings deposits of indivi\u00adduals, other categories of savings deposits shown in Table 11\u201435 have changed little. Mainly on account of the credit restrictions introduced by the Central Bank and the quantitative controls on imports by Government in August 1960, total loans and advances of commercial banks fell from Rs. 556.9 million in August",

    "text": "1961 when total loans and advances rose from Rs. 560.9 million in March to Rs. 589.3 million. Thereafter there has been a certain amount of fluctuation. At the end of August 1961 total loans and advances were at Rs. 560*8 million or at a slightly higher level than in August, 1960. The monthly average level of loans and overdrafts was higher in 1961 being Rs. 434.6 million as against Rs. 429.7 million in 1960. Total overdrafts fell by Rs. 5.1 million in Decmber 1960 to Rs. 289*6 million in November 1961. Loans fell by Rs. 10 million from Rs. 138.1 million in 1960 to Rs. 128.1 million in November 1961. Export bills rose by Rs. 9.7 million from Rs. 55.4 million to Rs. 65.1 million and import bills from Rs. 53.3 million to Rs.53.8 million. The sharp increase in loans and overdrafts in March and April could be partly attributed to the disorganisation of banking services resulting from a dispute between the commercial banks and their employees. During this dispute since commercial banking operations were confined mainly to the encash\u00adment of cheques the banks had to extend the credit limits of constituents who had already taken overdrafts from them; thus it will be seen that the increase in tota loans and advances was mainly in respect of overdrafts which rose from Rs. 299.8 million in February to Rs. 321.7 million in April 1961. The increase in loans and overdrafts in January over the December 1960 figure is partly due to the Improvement in excess reserve and the liquidity position of the commercial banks in this period and to several banks converting overdrafts into loans to enable themselves to borrow from the Central Bank at the concessionary rate of 1\\ per cent against usance promissory notes in terms of Section 82 (1) of the Monetary Law Act. After this facility was withdrawn in February 1961 commercial banks ceased to follow this practice and the loans fell slightly thereafter.",

Consumption loans are mainly those given directly by the commercial banks to their constituents for the purpose of either purchasing durable consumption goods or financial assis\u00adtance for various contingencies and loans of a purely personal nature. The fall in the categories of advances for financial and consumption purposes is mainly due to the restrictions which were introduced on the availability of credit for hire purchase transactions and for other non-essential purposes. The increase in the volume of advances for commercial purposes has been largely due to the expan\u00adsion in the volume of credit to the export trade. The increase in advances for agricultural and industrial purposes shows that the banks are now diverting a slightly larger proportion of their resources than previously for these purposes.",

The small increase in the total collections for 1961 as against 1960 is due to the fact that in the current year very few new employments were brought into the Fund and in 1960 considerable coverage had already been given to existing employments.",

Total loans outstand\u00ading at the end of November 1961 was Rs. 30.7 million as against Rs. 31.7 million in December 1960. Between January and June 1961 total loans fell by Rs. 0.4 million as compared with an increase of Rs. 0.2 million in the same period in 1960. The Corporation has made all its new loans out of capital repayments as there has been no net increase in the volume of resources avai\u00adlable for lending. One of the reasons for the fall in volume of new loans of the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation has been the extension of maturit\u00adies on existing loans because of the fall in commodity prices and on other restric-",

With the extension of the maturities on these loans the repayments which were normally utilised for the making of new loans have fallen substantially. Another reason for the fall in the volume of credit given by the Corporation has been the adoption of a more restrictive lending policy and a closer examination of the purpose for which loans are required. It has introduced a policy of scrutinising more closely loans which are not directly required for purposes of industrial and agricul\u00adtural development. As a result of this policy applications from clients who normally seek financial assistance from the Corporation for purposes such as transfer or sale of property from one person to another have tended to decrease.",
