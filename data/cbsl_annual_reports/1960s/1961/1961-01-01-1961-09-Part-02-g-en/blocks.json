    "text": "Ceylon's balance of payments accounts (according to Exchange Control data) for 1961 as set out in Tables 25 A, B and C in Appendix II show that the external balance continued to be adverse in that year. Yet, there was a marked improvement in the external payments position. Although a deficit of Rs 754 million was recorded on current account in 1961, the fifth consecutive annual deficit, it was considerably lower than the deficits in 1958, 1959 and 1960 of Rs. 152.9 million, Rs. 208.0 million and Rs. 220.5 million respectively. The most striking aspect of the 1961 performance was the fact that the improvement in the balance of payments was achieved despite a sizeable decline in export earn\u00adings in that year. Imports, which had been progressively increasing up to 1960 declined substantially more than exports in 1961, bringing about a sharp con\u00adtraction in the merchandise deficit, from Rs. 202.8 million in 1960 to Rs. 627 million in 1961. In 1961 the deficit on invisibles account also registered a small decline from Rs. 17.7 million in 1960 to Rs. 12.7 million contributing in a small degree towards the overall improvement in the current account balance.",

The main result of this change has been to make the coverage of the reserve data more comprehensive, by including in these data on external reserves, (i) the gross balances due to Ceylon under bilateral payments agreements and (ii) export bills held by local banks for encashment by foreign banks. With this change in the reserve data all the statistics on the balance of payments are computed uniformly on the basis of local records.

As pointed out there, the decline in the value of exports was wholly due to a sharp drop in prices of export commodities, with the volume of exports showing some increase. In contrast, the main cause for the decline in import payments was the substantial contraction in import volumes; the import price index declined fractionally. The contraction in import volumes occurred in all three broad categories of imports, viz. consumer goods, intermediate goods and inves\u00adtment goods, but was most marked in the case of those consumer goods which had been subject to tariff and quantitative restrictions in late 1960 and early 1961; such commodities could broadly be classified as luxuries and non-essen\u00adtials.",

The beneficial impact on the balance of pay\u00adments of the decline in dividend payments was only in part offset by a fail in the interest earned on Ceylon's external assets which were further run down in 1961.

In 1961 along with the reduction in the financing deficit there was a significant change in the method of financing of the deficit. In 1959 and 1960 the bulk of the deficit was finanied out of a decline in external reserves. In 1961, however, the financing deficit was very largely financed through an increase in Ceylon's foreign liabilities and through foreign grants, necessitating only a very small fall in external reserves. The main increase in Ceylon's foreign liabilities occurred as a result of the purchase of foreign exchange amounting to Rs. 53-8 million from the International Monetary Fund in April, 1961. Other increases were Rs. 21-3 million in the short-term debt under Ceylon's bilateral payments agreements and Rs. 23.8 million in long-term borrowings from the I.B.R.D., Development Loans Fund and U.S.S.R.",

The surplus with the Dollar Area was somewhat higher than that of the past five years, while the deficit with the Sterling Area at Rs. 2288 million was subtantially lower than the average deficit of Rs. 290.0 million recorded during the period 1957 to 1960. Within the Sterling Area, the deficits with the United Kingdom and India and Pakistan decreased by Rs. 113 9 million and Rs. 405 million compared with 1960. On the other hand, the surplus with the rest of the Sterling Area countries, namely, Australia and Malaya registered a slight decrease. The improvement in the current account deficit with the Sterling Area was almost entirely due to lower import payments to this area. The deficit with the non-dollar, non-sterling area countries worsened slightly from Rs. 51-5 million in 1960 to Rs. 60.2 million in 1961, in continuation of the trend observed since 1957. This was due to th^ surplus registered in 1960 with non-O. E. E. C. countries, viz. China, Japan and Middle East countries turning into a deficit in 1961. The deficit with the Continental O. E. E. C * countries at Rs. 29.8 million was, however, lower by Rs. 33.2 million than that in the previous year.",

Therefore, a continuation of the policy of restraints over imports and other foreign payments along with stonger measures to curtail the domestic monetary expansion are required.",

    "text": "The balance of payments statements are based on Exchange Control records of external receipts and payments. The merchandise balance shown in the balance of payments statement differs from the trade balance calculated from Customs Returns because of differences in timing and coverage; Timing: Generally there is a time lag in the payments as compared with the actual movement of goods. With a declining flow of physical imports, as has been evident from late 1960, payments for imports revealed a trend of decline with a lag. Thus payments for imports in 1961 have been higher than the actual receipt of merchandise in that year. This feature is also explained by large payments made to Burma in early 1961 in respect of rice imported in the previous year. Coverage: The main difference is in regard to exports. Exports according to trade returns includes re-exports, principally of oil and other fuel to ships calling in Colombo. This item of re-exports is shown, following the international classification, as transportation earnings in the balance of payments statement. Once adjusted for this the export figures according to trade returns as well as Exchange Control records, are reason\u00adably close to each other.",
