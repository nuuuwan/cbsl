In recent years the overall deficit in the government budget had assumed sizeable dimensions and constituted the chief causal factor behind the monetary expansion. In the budget for 1960-61 several measures were introduced to raise additional revenues and to reduce the budgetary gap. Altho\u00adugh these measures did succeed in augmenting total revenues the extent of the increase fell short of expectations and did not suffice to offset the rise in total expenditure. In the result the overall budgetary deficit and the extent of inflationary financing attained dimensions that were not substantially different from those of the years immediately preceding. A fall in revenues from export duties following the recession in prices, legislative delays in respect of new taxation and shortfalls in foreign borrowings contributed towards this result.",

In its previous Annual Reports the Central Bank analysed the causes of this decline and indicated that a sustained monetary expansion through the medium of successive overall budgetary deficits was the chief contributory actor to this situation. Throughout that period, with the exception of the latter part of 1960, the prices of Ceylon's principal exports and her terms of trade remained relatively stable.",

However, one of the developments in that year was a shift in the manner in which the external payments deficit came to be financed-namely-by means of an increase in external liabilities rather than a running down of external reserves. Thus in April, 1961 Ceylon had recourse to a drawing of Rs. 53.8million from the International Monetary Fund. If this amount is excluded the decline in external reserves would have been Rs 62.1 million - a magnitude which is still substantially below the losses experienced in the years immediately preceding",

In terms of total value, imports declined from Rs 1,960 million in 1960 to Rs 1,703 million in 1961 - a decline of Rs 257 million. As mentioned a part of the reduction in import values was due to a fall in import prices. But the contribution of this factor to the reduction in total import value was slight in comparison to the contraction in import volume. The index of import volume, which had been steadily rising in recent years fell to 95 in 1961 in comparison to 113 in 1960 and 116 in 1959. In other words, in 1961 Ceylon experienced a reduction, relative to the previous year, of about 15.9 per cent in the physical quantity of goods imported.",

Amongst the items in this category, foreign travel (including official-arid private travel and educational remittances, but not expenditure on pa\u00adssages) showed a deficit of Rs. 17.7 million in 1961 as against Rs. 24.3 million in 1960, and investment income a deficit of 40.4 million in 1961 as against Rs. 44.2 million in 1960. In the capital account too the restraint on the net outflow on private capital continued. Total net outflows on this item, inclusive of short-term capital amounted to Rs. 5.7 million in in 1961 as against Rs. 5.3 million in 1960. The small proportion which these items bear to total external payments abroad and the fact that restrictions on them had already been in force prior to 1961 implies, however,\" that the contribution they were able to make to the total reduction in payments abroad was relatively small.",

As already mentioned, in 1961 there was a shift in the manner of financing of the current account-deficit-a shift towards increasing external liabilities as against drawing down external reserves. As the table shows, in previous years on the other hand, by far the greater part of the burden of the current account deficit fell on Ceylon's external reserves. The chief element in the increase of Rs. 88.0 million in liabilities in 1961 was the drawing of Rs 53.8 million from the International Monetary Fund ( I ) in April of that year. Other liabilities comprised drawings on I. B. R. D. and other loans, and increases in payments agreements balances due from Ceylon. Changes in payments agreements balances due to Ceylon are included in the change in external reserves.",

It is important to recognise however, that despite this improve\u00adment Ceylon's balance of payments continued to remain adverse in 1961. Although strenuous and effective efforts were made towards a reduction in imports there emerged a deficit on current account of Rs. 75.4 million. Clearly the scope for further reductions in import outlays will become narrower as the margin of non-essential or less essential imports is reduced and the needs of development increase. Unless export earnings were themselves to rise there\u00adfore, or, on the alternative, external liabilities were to be increased still further, it is likely that Ceylon will continue to experience severe pressures on her external reserves. In other words, despite the relative improvement in 1961, Ceylon has yet to attain a position of stability in respect of her external payments.",

Ceylon's external assets at the end of 1961 amounted to Rs. 533 million, (2)representing 25.8 per cent of the years import payments inclusive of invisibles. This is a low figure in relation to levels prevailing earlier. It is also low in the context of future pressures on imports arising out of development and other needs, and in terms of the contingency of further adverse fluctuations in export earnings. At the end of 1961 the International Reserve of the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 184.7 million and constituted 34.7 per cent of total external assets. On comparison at the end of 1960 the Central Bank's Inter\u00adnational Reserve was Rs. 190.2 million. There was no significant change in the liquidity pattern of the International Reserve relative to 1960. At the end of 1961 cash balances abroad, including Treasury Bills and bills discounted, amounted to Rs. 92.2",

Textile imports also declined by Rs. 21.9 million in 1961. In addition to the quantitative restrictions, the sharp increeses in import duties levied in January and July 1961, exerted a further restrictive effect and made their contribution to the decline in total imports.",

This was primarily the consequence of the continued growth in the overall budgetary deficits of the Government with additional credit creation for the private sector playing a relatively mfhor role. Although, an excess of import outlays earnings during that period served to restrain the expansionary effect of these over factors on the domestic money supply, this restraint was at the expense of the country's external reserves. The situation arising out of the need to correct Ceylon's external payments position, therefore, called for measures not only to bring about a direct reduction in imports but also to curtail the underlying monetary expansion. Indeed, with the introduction of quantitative restrictions, the curtailment of the monetary expansion attained a new significance since there was now a need to minimize the inflationary consequences of the reduct' ion in import supplies.",

In the final result actual accruals ih 1960-61 rose by Rs 110 million, 59 per cent of which was provided by the established sources of revenue, 26 per cent from the surcharge and 15 per cent from the new taxes introduced for the first time.

Amounts negotiated in the form of foreign grants and loans may not actually accrue within the year if they are related to specific projects which get delayed in execution and on which actual outlays lag behind the amounts estimated. Although such delays would also result in savings on the side of expenditure these are often offset by increases in outlays in other directions. There is in addition a further point. Borrowings and grants from P L 480 rupee counterpart funds, through a source of finance for government expenditures, are expansionist in their effect since they do not result in offsetting accruals of foreign exchange. The saving of foreign exchange through P L 480 transactions takes place at the earlier stage of the purchase of imported wheat for rupee payments. The inclusion of funds from this source as a means of finance for the budget deficit does not, therefore, reduce the expansionary impact of the deficit.",

The provision for current expenditure excluding sinking fund contributions was in fact Rs. 30 million below actual outlays in the previous year largely on account of a reduced estimate for food subsidies.

The Sales Tax which was estimated to provide Rs. 45 million has not been enforced as yet whilst administrative problems and other factors may affect the yield from the other new taxes.

Between the beginning of October and the end of December, 1961 the amount of Treasury Bills outstanding increased by Rs. 25 million and the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury Bills by Rs. 13 million. At 31st December, 1961 the total of Central Bank's holdings of Treasury Bills amounted to Rs. 693.6 million. In Decmber 1961 the autho\u00adrised limit of Treasury Bills was again raised by resolution of Parliament from Rs. 750 million to Rs. 1000 million.",

There is admittedly greater scope for increasing the quantum of both domestic borrowing and foreign aid in the future. Household and corpor\u00adate savings will tend to increase with the rise in incomes throughout the economy and with the chanelling of receipts from such sources as provident funds and insurance funds. Similarly, the scope for extended borrowing from abroad would rise as effective plans and programmes in the field of development mature. Yet, as the experience of recent years shows receipts from these sources alone will not suffice to meet the entire needs of development finance. Moreover, such receipts are not generally amenable to rapid adjustment from year to year to meet the varying requirements of the budgetary situation. The need for a surplus of revenues over current expenditures as an additional and substantial source of development finance thus becomes imperative.",

In 1958, Ceylon's direct tax structure was basically revised through the introduction of an integrated system of taxes on income, expenditure and property. However, largely on account of the limited capacity of the system, particularly in the early phase, to respond to the pressing need for additional revenue, a number of supplementary taxes had to be further imposed. A situation in which new taxes need to be introduced from time to time makes desirable a frequent review of the tax structure as a whole with a view to integrating the changes made into a consistent and balanced system.

Clearly, as the possibilities on this score are utilized more fully, the additional accruals to revenue will tend progressively to narrow. Further increases in tax revenue will then invariably involve an extension to the tax base itself. Some of the new taxes recently introduced do, in fact, reflect a partial extension of the tax base. These include the National Develop\u00adment Tax, the Land tax and the Registration Tax on self employed persons. Such indirect taxes as import duties and the Sales Tax are also more pervasive in their incidence. One of the requirements of the tax system, in the context of a developing economy, is the capacity to absorb a portion of the increments to incomes that accrue to the community in the process of development itself. Where such increments tend to be widely diffused a tax system dependant on a relatively restricted base will not by itself prove adequate.",

In recent years, the accruals to revenue through increases in taxation have been largely absorbed by persistent increases in current expenditures.

Such a reduction in the payments deficit would tend, in the background of a continuing budge\u00adtary expansion, to result in a further increase in bank liquidity and in the capa\u00adcity of the banking system to expand credit. However, whilst there was a need for a general restraint on credit it was also necessary to ensure that the burden of the restriction fell most heavily on credit for less essential imports and other non-productive purposes.

    "text": "In August 1960, the Central Bank introduced a series of measures in the monetary field which were designed to influence the volume and.direction of commercial bank lending and to supplement the measures taken by government in the fiscal sphere. Commercial banks were required to obtain a 50% cash margin against letters of credit for the importation of certain goods; they were also required tblmpose restrictions on the availability of finance for hire purchase operations as \"well as to contain the total of advances for the importation or purchase of specified types of goods. In addition, credit restraints of a more general character were also introduced. The Central Bank's rate of interest of 2|9o on advances, prevailing earlier, was increased to 4% subject to a special concessionary rate of 2%% on advances relating to the financing of imports of certain essentials, domestic production, and exports. The reserve requirements of the commercial banks against total deposits were also raised from 10 per cent to 12 per cent.",

    "text": "In 1961 the restraints on bank credit were intensified by the introduction of further measures. In January, 1961, the special concessionary rate of 2\u00a3 per cent referred to above relating to Central Bank advances to commercial banks was replaced by the general rate of 4 per cent. An exception was made however, in the case of advances against the pledge of certain categories of usance promis\u00adsory notes of co-operative societies for which a rate of 3% was applicable. In February, 1961, the Central Bank further increased the statutory reserve require\u00adments of the commercial banks against demand deposits. In addition to the general reserve requirement of 12% against total deposits, commercial banks were required to maintain special reserves equal to 38% of any increase in the total of demand deposits over the level prevailing at 1st Februarv, 1961. This amounted in effect to a 50% reserve ratio for all deposits above the established margin. From July, 1961, however, commercial banks were permitted to include holdings of currency notes and coins in excess of their holdings on a specified date - March 15th, 1961 - as part of their statutory reserves,- subject to the condition that holdings of currency notes and coins could not constitute more than 50 per cent of statutory reserves. Further with effect from October 1, 1961 loan and overdraft' facilities granted to foreign firms other than those in the export trade were required by Exchange Control to be curtailed by one third.",

In 1961 on the other hand there was a moderate increase in commercial bank lending to Government of Rs. 27 million. This was primarily due to increased commercial bank purchases of Treasury Bills. In 1961 the monthly average of Treasury Bills holdings of banks increased by Rs. 22 million. If the increase in commercial bank lending to Government is included the total increases in commercial bank credit in 1961 is comparable to the increases in recent years. However, bank credit to Government forms part of the expansionist impact of Government finance which has already been discussed in the preceding section.",

The impact of the raising of statutory reserves requirements, for instance, is partly illustrated by the fact that whilst in 1961 the commercial banks, actual cash reserves were, on the basis of monthly averages, Rs. 109.7 milliofTas against Rs. 101.2 million in 1960, excess reserves over the statutory requirement had fallen from Rs. 12.9 million to Rs. 5.1 million. In fact during the latter part of 1961 from the end of August to the end of November, the total reserves of the commercial banks did not rise above the statutory minimum..

The increased supplies of imported goods served, to a large extent, to protect the general level of prices in Ceylon from pressures of the monetary expansion. In 1961, with the sharp contraction in the volume of imports the situation has altered basically. Given the continuance of the expansionist factors in the monetary field, the contraction in the supply of goods implies rising pressures on prices and costs.",

Provisional data obtained from a partial survey of import stocks conducted by the Central Bank indicatedi for instance, a significant increase in the stocks of certain major categories of imported consumer goods between March and July 1960. There were also indications of a further increase in stocks during the latter part of that year with the continued arrival of goods ordered prior to the restrictions of August, 1960. The existence of such stocks would have served partially to offset the effects of the contraction on imports on the availability of supplies through 1961.",

On the other hand, the fact that savings are held in very liquid forms could mean that such savings are temporary and that the holdings of currency are a potential source of consumer spending.",

The external price for exports could not be raised in response to increases in domestic costs. A continued rise in costs could result, therefore, in a progressive reduction in output as the competitive position of the export sector is weakened.

As discussed in the last Annual Report, duties on imports, when effectively applied, for instance, also serve the purpose of curtailing the magnitude of imports. But unlike quantitative restrictions they enable the maintenance of an element of flexibility in supplies, in response to varying needs. Moreover, import duties are able to channel to government revenue a part of the windfall profits that would otherwise accrue to private traders as a result of the increase in prices following the contraction in supplies. To the extent that there additional revenues reduce the budgetary deficit they are disinflationary in effect. High import duties on certain categories of goods provide in fact a convenient instrument for siphoning away to Government revenue part of the expansion in consumer purchasing power that invariably accompanies a process of development.",

As described in a later section, the introduction of quantitative restrictions for balance of payments purposes has given an undoubted stimulus to the establishment of domestic industries producing import substitutes. This is one of the factors in the economic picture of 1961 which is of particular significance to the future development of the economy. But here again the long-run perspective is of importance- Although industrial development in Ceylon needs the shelter of protection it is important that the industries established reflect an economic use; of resources within the industrial field. Quantitative restrictions, though a powerful instrument of protection, are less discriminating in their effects and may prove, therefore, to be a less effective weapon in a flexible and selective policy of protec\u00adtion than the import tariff. It is specially desireable that the process of future development should result in the establishment of an efficient and viable industrial structure. The choice of the instruments of control is of particular relevance for achieving this end.",
