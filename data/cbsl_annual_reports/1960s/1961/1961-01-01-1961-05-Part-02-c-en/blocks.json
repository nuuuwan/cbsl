The large increase in prices in the clothing group was due both to increases in the import duties on textiles and the restrictions on the import of textiles whose c. i. f. value was over Rs 2/- per yard introduced on January 25, 1961. The main factors bringing about the increase in the fuel and light group were the increases in the duty on kerosene oil by 3 cents per gallon and the increase in the excise duty on a box of matches by If cents. In the miscellaneous group the increase in the import duty on tobacco by Rs. 8. 50 per pound and the raising of the excise duty on local tobacco by Rs. 8/- per pound to Rs. 28/- per pound on July 27, 1961, were mainly responsible for the rise.",

The wage rate index of government school teachers increased by 17.4 per cent in the same period. These increases took place largely in two stages.

    "text": "In 1961 the number of strikes in the plantation sector was considerably lower than in the previous year, while in the rest of the economy their numbers showed a slight deterioration from the previous year. The largest number of strikes, however, took place in the plantation sector where the major part of the working population organised in unions are employed. About 64.6 per cent of plantation workers are members of unions and their numbers constitute about 59.7 per cent of all employees, who are members of unions. In 1961 the num\u00adber of strikes on plantations and other employments totalled 89* and 38* compared with 123 and 37 respectively in 1960. In the plantation sector the number of workers involved was also considerably less than in the previous year. In other employments too though the number of strikes compared closely with the numbers for the previous year they involved a much larger number of workers. A significant feature was that the number of man-days lost increased considerably as the average duration of strikes in the plantation and non-plantation sectors rose from 6.1 days and 3.1 days in 1960 to 10.9* days and 5.3* days in 1961, respectively.",
