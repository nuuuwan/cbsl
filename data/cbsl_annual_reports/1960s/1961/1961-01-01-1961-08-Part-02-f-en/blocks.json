The shortfall was in respect of rubber (Rs. 25.7 million), tea (Rs. 4.9 million) and coconut (Rs. 3.2 million). The export duties on both rubber and coconut were reduced during the year, consequent to a deterioration in their prices. The export duty on rubber was reduced from 0.38 cents per pound to 0.30 cents per pound in November 1960 and to 0.20 cents per pound in February 1961. The export duties on copra, coconut oil and desiccated coconut were reduced from Rs. 245, Rs. 185 and Rs. 140 per ton respectively to Rs. 185, Rs. 140 and Rs. 100 per ton respectively on May 22, 1961.",

The import duties on transport equipment brought in Rs. 8.5 million less than in 1959-60.

Instead Government's total expenditure is divided into four cate\u00adgories viz., personal emoluments, administration charges, services provided by departments arid economic development and each of the last three categories is further divided into recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure. Thus Government's total expenditure is divided into seven votes. In this table the total expenditure falling under the personal emoluments and recurrent expenditure votes viz., votes 1,2, 4 and 6 and the total of the Capital Expenditure votes viz., 3, 5 and 7 are shown separately as recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure respectively. Since a similar classification is not available for years prior to 1960-i61, expenditure chargeable to revenue and expenditure chargeable to loan funds are assumed to be comparable to recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure respectively.",

In 1959-60, this amounted to Rs. 46.0 millon. The corresponding figure for 1960-61 is Rs. 3.3 million. Taking these figures into account, the adjusted figures of domestic market borrowing from non-bank sources for 1959-60 and 1960-61 are Rs. 129.8 million and Rs. 165.5 million respectively i. e., an increase of approximately Rs. 36.0 million. The increased contributions came largely from companies, savings institutions, insurance companies, the Employees' Provident Fund and clubs and institutions. Sinking fund contributions to new government paper showed a decline during the year. Clubs and institutions contributed Rs.15.1 million during 1960-61 while in 1959-60 they reduced their holdings by Rs. 0.7 million. The Employees' Provident Fund invested Rs. 7.6 million more in government paper in 1960-61 than in 1959-60. Semi-government savings institutions increased their holdings of government paper by Rs. 22.8 million during 1960-61 while in 1959-60 the corresponding figure was Rs. 17.1 million. Insurance companies contributed Rs. 3.5 million more to government loans in 1960-61 than in 1959-60.
