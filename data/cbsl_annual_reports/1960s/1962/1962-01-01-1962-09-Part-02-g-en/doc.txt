(G) GOVERNMENT FINANCE

The, Financial Year 1961-62

Table II G- 1 shows in summary the accounts of the Government of Ceylon for the financial year October, 1961 to September, 1962, with corresponding data for previous years. As shown therein the main features of Government's budgetary operations were as follows:—

(a) Total revenue in 1961/62 was Rs. 1625.3 million1 as compared with Rs. 1513.9 million in 1960/61 and Rs. 1403.8 million in 1959/60.

(6) Total voted expenditure in 1961/62 was Rs. 2067.6 million2 as compared with Rs. 1962.2 million in 1960/61 and Rs. 1820.0 million in 1959/60. These figures exclude contributions to sinking funds, direct repayments of public debt from revenue and book adjustments.3 In 1959/60 the figures also exclude the subscription of Rs. 37.0 million to the International Monetary Fund financed by a special loan from the Central Bank.

(c) Operations on advance accounts resulted in a net payment of Rs. 14.6

million as compared with net payments of Rs. 14.2 million in 1960/61 and Rs. 1.3 million in 1959/60.

(d) The net cash operating deficit resulting from these operations was Rs. 456.9

million as compared with Rs. 462.5 million in 1960/61 and Rs. 417.5 million in 1959/60.

The actual net cash operating deficit of Rs. 456.9 million exceeds the originally estimated deficit of Rs. 280.5 million* by Rs. 176.4 million. In 1960/61 the actual deficit exceeded the original budget estimate by Rs. 136.4 million.

As in 1960/61 the difference between the actual deficit and the estimated deficit arose mainly out of a shortfall in revenue. The shortfall in revenue amounted to Rs. 151.4 million as against Rs. 120 million in 1960/61. The shortfall in revenue was however partly offset by a shortfall in capital expenditure amounting to Rs. 37.5 million.

Revenue

Table 18 of Appendix shows the original estimate and actual revenue for 1961/62 by the main heads of revenue. Total Government revenue in 1961/62 at Rs. 1625.3 million exceeds the actual revenue for 1960/61 by Rs. 111.4 million as compared with the increase of Rs. 110.1 million registered in 1960/61 over the previous year.

1. This figure differs from the published figure in the Government Accounts in that it excludes the sum of Rs. 20-6 million being the transfer to revenue from the National Flood Relief Fund but includes the revenue of Rs. 18 • 6 million from the National Development Tax which has been treated in the Government Accounts as a credit to a special fund.

2. Voted expenditure includes all expenditure chargeable to foreign loans and grants. In the past expenditures financed out of foreign grants, mainly Colombo Plan and U.S. Aid were treated as extra-budgetary expenditures.

3. See foot-note to Table II G-l 4. The deficit announced in the Budget Speech for 1961/62, was Rs. 340 million. With the amend­ments made during the Committee Stage, the original budget estimates as approved by Parlia­ment provided for a gross deficit of Rs. 329 • 4 million. The estimated net cash operating deficit of Rs. 280-5 million is derived from this figure by excluding estimated contributions to sinking fund and repayments of foreign loans amounting to Rs. 48 • 9 million.

( 86 )

The increase over 1960/61 is accounted for mainly by import duties (Rs. 30 million) excise revenue, mainly arrack and tobacco (Rs. 33 million) and the national develop­ment tax (Rs. 19 million). Export duty revenue showed a decline of Rs. 11 million-

As compared with the original estimate for 1961/62, however, actual revenue has fallen short by Rs. 151.4 million. This shortfall is accounted for mainly by the sales tax (Rs. 45 million), registration tax on professions and businesses (Rs. 34 million), income tax, including the surcharge (Rs. 19 mihion), import duties (Rs. 21 million), electrical department revenue (Rs. 13 million) and national development tax (Rs. 6 million).

The main changes in revenue in 1961/62 as compared with the actual revenue

for 1960/61 and the original estimate for 1961/62 are as follows :—

Revenue from export duties was lower by Rs. 11 million as compared with

1960/61. This was a result of rubber duty revenue being less by Rs. 24 million com­pensated by an increase of Rs. 13 million in tea revenue and Rs. 1 million in coconut revenue.

( 87 )

The specific duty on rubber was replaced by a sliding scale on November, 24,1961. Consequent to the deteriorated position of the rubber market the switchover to the sliding scale was combined with a duty reduction; the effective rate of duty on the adoption of the sUding scale being -/13 cts. per lb. as against the former specific duty of -/20 cts. per lb. In the case of tea and coconuts the revenue increase was largely due to the increased export volumes.

Import duty revenue was Rs. 30 million higher than in the previous year. The revenue increase was concentrated in the customs category of "other goods". The higher revenue from this source is attributable to the duty increases imposed from time to time. In January, 1961 a general import duty of 5 per cent was imposed on goods other than foodstuffs. The full impact on revenue of this measure was felt only in 1961/62. Import duties on selective items were further increased in July

1962 by the 1962/63 Budget. A 20 per cent increase on the existing rates of duty was imposed in August, 1962 in lieu of the withdrawn Sales Tax. The revenue from tobacco and cigarette imports registered a decline of Rs. 10 million on account of reduced imports following the higher duties imposed by the 1961/62 Budget. It should be noted that the revenue from tobacco and cigarettes has fallen short of the original estimate by Rs. 39 million. Obviously the original estimate based on the higher duties had been an over-estimate which did not take into account a decline in consumption. There was however a compensatory increase of Rs. 18 million in the revenue from the local tobacco tax. This tax too had been increased in the 1961 /62 Budget.

The taxes introduced in the 1960/61 Budget yielded only Rs. 7 million more in 1961/62, their total revenue being only Rs. 23 million as against an estimated

Rs. 61 million. The shortfall was almost entirely in respect of the Registration of Professions and Businesses tax which yielded only Rs. 3 million as against an esti­mated Rs. 37 million. Professions and businesses earning an annual income of less than Rs. 3600 per annum, which were included for this tax in the original estimate, were exempted in the final legislation: This and administrative delays could be regarded as contributing to the shortfall in the revenue from this source.

Of the new taxes introduced by the 1961/62 Budget, the National Development Tax yielded Rs. 19 million as against an estimated Rs. 25 million. The Sales Tax which was estimated to yield Rs. 45 million in 1961/62 was not introduced till after the 1962/63 Budget was presented at the end of July 1962. However, after being in force for two days it was withdrawn to be replaced by a 20 per cent increase on existing rates of import duty on a wide range of goods.

1 Current expenditure is derived by deducting the value of sinking fund contributions and ex­penditure of a capital nature (such as maintenance expenditure and.purchase of durable goods) from the total of the Recurrent Expenditure votes (1,2,4 and 6).

2 Capital expenditure includes expenditure on the creation, acquisition and maintenance of real assets whose useful life exceeds one year and expenditure on the acquisition of financial assets, mainly loans to the C.T.B., the Port (Cargo) Corporation and the Local Loans and Deve­lopment Fund. Capital expenditure according to this definition is not synonymous with development expenditure as it includes certain capital items of a non-development character and excludes certain current items of development expenditure. Capital expenditure is made up of the expenditure under the capital expenditure votes (i.e. votes 3, 5 and 7) expenditure chargeable to foreign aid, both loans and grants, capital items in the recurrent expenditure votes and extra-budgetary outlays such as the rubber and tea replanting subsidy expenditure, Electrical Department Reserve expenditure, etc. Extra-budgetary outlays amount to Rs. 38-9 million in 1959-60, Rs. 28-3 million in 1960-61, Rs. 33-6 million (estimate) and Rs.18- 0 million (provisional) in 1961-62 and Rs. 24-0 million in 1962-63.

Provisional figures of actual current expenditure show an increase of Rs. 24.1 million over the previous year as compared with increases of Rs. .105.9 million in 1960-61 and Rs. 91.0 million in 1959-60. The smaller increase in current expenditure in 1961-62 was entirely due to the lower food subsidy bill. The increase in the food subsidy bill was the major cause of the increase in current expenditure in the two previous years. Increases in expenditure on pensions, interest on public debt and education were partly offset by the fall in the food subsidy bill.

The food subsidy bill amounted to Rs. 235.4 million in 1961-62 as compared with Rs. 248.0 million in 1960-61, Rs. 193.0 million in 1959-60 and Rs. 146.5 million in 1958-59. An increase of Rs. 38.9 million in the profit from flour

and sugar was partly offset by an increase of Rs. 26.8 million in the subsidy on rice.

The higher profit from flour is attributable to the increase by 5 cts. per pound in the price of flour i.e. from 23 cts. to 28 cts. per pound effected by the 1961-62 Budget.

Current Expenditure:—

Data on current and capital expenditure for the years 1959-60 to 1962-63 are given in the following table:—

TABLE II G - 3

( 89 )

In the case of sugar there was a sharp fall in the purchase price of white sugar and only white sugar was imported and distributed in 1961-62. This automatically resulted in a higher profit as white sugar was being sold at a price 7 cts. above that of raw sugar. The retail selling price of white sugar was raised by 5 cents per pound by the 1961-62 Budget, but the old price was subsequently restored in Decem­ber 1961. The increase in the total subsidy on rice (both consumer and producer subsidy) was considerably lower than the increase in previous years. This is accounted for by a reduction in the sales of rationed rice (by Government to retail distri­butors) and a smaller increase than in previous years in purchases under the Guaran­teed Price Scheme. The reduced volume of sales of rationed rice is attributable partly to a lower level of stock holding by retail distributors as a result of Government policy and partly to the surrender of rice ration books by income tax payers in order to obtain relief from the rice ration book tax which was introduced by the 1961/62 Budget.

Purchases of paddy under the Guaranteed Price Scheme during 1961/62 amoun­

ted to 25,065,89P bushels or the equivalent of 341,032 tons of rice, as compared with

326,272 tons in 1960-61 and 270,000 tons in 1959-60.

The average landed cost of rice from Burma was Rs. 535 per ton as compared

with Rs. 530 during the previous year. The purchase price of flour from Australia,

the major supplier, remained at the same level as in the previous year. The average

landed cost of white sugar declined from Rs. 565 per ton to Rs. 500per ton in 1961/62.

Capital Expenditure

Total capital expenditure for 1961/62 at Rs. 596.0 million wasRs. 76.9 million

higher than the expenditure for the previous year. Loans to Government agencies

increased by Rs. 35.8 million while expenditure on the acquisition, construction and

maintenance of real assets increased by Rs. 41.1 million. Available data indicate

that the major increases have occurred in respect of public utilities and agriculture,

irrigation and fisheries.

* Revised to include capital expenditure chargeable to foreign grants which has been brought into the budget from 1960-61 onwards.

The sources of finance for the originally estimated net cash operating deficit of Rs. 280.5 milhon-|- indicated in the Budget Speech were Rs. 162 million f from domestic market borrowing and Rs. 129 millionf from foreign aid. The actual net cash operating deficit on account of the reasons mentioned earlier in this section was

Rs. 456.9 million. This substantial expansion in the size of the deficit above the anticipated figure together with a shortfall in domestic market borrowing resulted in a considerable amount of borrowing from the banking system. However, the substantial amount of funds accruing to the Treasury by way of deposits by the public and unexpended balances of corporations kept in deposit with the Treasury (see administrative borrowing above) caused bank borrowing to be less than what it would otherwise have been.

In the event the net expansionary impact of the budget as adjusted for the change in U.S. aid counterpart funds was somewhat less than in the previous financial year, amounting to Rs. 190.4 million as against Rs. 233.9 million in 1960/61. The corresponding figure for 1959/60 was Rs. 251.1 million.

Of the total sum of Rs. 226.6 million borrowed from the banking system,

Rs. 162 million came from the Central Bank andRs. 64.5 million from the commercial banks. Direct Central Bank advances declined by Rs. 21.0 million. Treasury bill

•(• The figures according to the Budget Estimates were Rs. 329-4 million, Rs. 200 million and Rs. 140 million respectively. The figures of Rs. 280-5 million, Rs. 162 million and Rs. 129 million are derived by setting off contributions to sinking fund of Rs. 38-0 million and foreign loan repayments of Rs. 10-9 million against these figures, since they are not included as expenditure in the computation of the net cash operating deficit.

purchases by the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 183.9 million. Commercial banks purchased Treasury bills amounting to Rs. 42.0 million and rupee loans amounting to Rs. 23.1 million, while their holdings of Tax Reserve Certificates declined by

Rs. 0.6 million. In 1960/61 commercial bank investments in Government securities amounted to Rs. 37.1 million consisting of Rs. 37.3 million of Treasury bills, and

Rs. 1.3 million of Tax Reserve Certificates offset by a decline of Rs. 1.5 million in rupee securities.

Government's cash balances which were negligible at the beginning of the finan­cial year increased by Rs. 40.2 million.

Foreign aid for capital expenditure received in 1961/62 amounted to Rs. 63.5 million as against Rs. 29.6 million in 1960/61 and Rs. 38.6 million in 1959/60. Foreign loan repayments during the three years amounted to Rs. 5.3 million, Rs. 3.0 million and Rs. 2.7 million respectively. It should be noted that the shortfall in the realization of foreign aid as against the budgetary expectation makes little difference with respect to the financing of the deficit where the receipt of aid is matched by an equivalent amount of capital expenditure. This is particularly true where aid is received in the form of equipment. The details of foreign aid received in 1961/62 are as follows:—

Domestic market borrowing from non-bank sources showed a significant decline

from Rs. 165.2 million in 1960/61 to Rs. 107.8 million in 1961/62.

The decline in the demand for Government securities was widespread affecting both institutional and non-institutional investors. The Employees' Provident Fund was perhaps the only exception, increasing its annual investment in Government

The decline in the demand for Government securities on the part of non-bank

investors in 1961/62 may be attributable to certain special circumstances operating

in that year. The fact that privately owned time and savings deposits of commercial

banks increased by Rs. 42.7 million in 1961/62 as against a decline of Rs. 2.0 million

in 1960/61 suggests that the fall in contributions to Government securities from non-

bank sources was not due to a general decline in savings. In part, however, the increase

in time and savings deposits of commercial banks would appear to represent a shift

from investments in Government securities. In September, 1961 most commercial

banks increased the rate offered on fixed deposits of Rs. 25,000 and above to 3 per

cent.

In the case of companies and provident and pension funds, business uncertainties

and import controls — involving retrenchment of staff in some cases — could have

provided an additional liquidity motive in the shift away from long term investments

to time deposits. In the case of insurance companies, the private companies ceased

to do new life business with effect from January 1, 1962. The state-owned Insurance

Corporation which commenced business on the same day was not in a position to

sustain the flow of funds from this source as it had a need to build up a margin of

working capital and liquid reserves. Thus a temporary drop in the flow of funds from

this source was inevitable. The temporary suspension of bank credit facilities on

account of the unsettled banking situation in the early part of the year could also

have been a contributory factor to the reduced response to Government securities.

The major sources of administrative borrowing were money order funds in transit

(Rs. 17-9 million), Ceylon Transport Board (Rs. 22-0 million) and other Government

agencies (Rs. 50*8 million).

securities by Rs. 4 million i.e. from Rs. 55.5 million in 1960/61 to Rs. 59.4 million

in 1961/62. The changes in respect of the other major investor groups are as follows:—

(1). These figures of public debt exclude National Housing Debentures amounting to Rs. 70 million and State Mortgage Bank Debentures amounting to Rs. 45 • 8 million as at the end of September, 1962.

The increase in the gross debt and the net debt during the financial year 1961-62

was Rs. 386.8 million and Rs. 353.4 million respectively. The corresponding figures

for the year 1960/61 are Rs. 420.6 million and Rs. 419.9 million. The increase in the

gross debt by Rs. 386.8 million consisted of a rise of Rs. 118.7 million in rupee

securities, Rs. 250.0 million in treasury bills, Rs. 1.9 million in Tax Reserve Certificates

and Rs. 37.1 million in foreign debt. There was a repayment of Rs. 20.9 million in

Central Bank advances.

There were ten issues of rupee securities during the financial year 1961-62.

Of these the 3i per cent Loan 1965-67. the 3-i per cent Loan 1967-72 and the 4 j per cent

Loan 1983-87 'B' Series were issued in conversion of Rs. 48.7 million of the 2 | % Loan

1960-62 which matured during the year. Stock of the maturing loan amounting to

Rs. 41.7 million was surrendered in payment for stock of the three new loans. The

balance of Rs. 7.0 million was subscribed for in cash.

The other seven loans which were issued entirely for cash were the 4^ per cent

September 1962. All the issues totalling Rs. 193.7 million were fully subscribed. A

classification of the allotments of these loans is shown in Table No. II G—9.

Treasury Bills :—As in recent financial years the increase in the volume of

Treasury bills constituted the largest component in the increase in the public debt

during 1961-62. The volume of Treasury bills outstanding increased from Rs. 750.0

million at the end of September 1961 to Rs. 1,000.0 million at the end of September,

1962. The increase was absorbed largely by the Central Bank. The holdings of Treasury

bills by the Central Bank as at the end of September, 1962 was Rs. 864.4 million as

compared with Rs. 680.0 million at the end of September, 1961.

During the financial year 1961-62 the authorised limit on Treasury bills was

raised by resolution of Parliament on 14th December, 1961, from Rs. 750.0 million

to Rs. 1,000.0 million.

Foreign Debt:—The increase in the gross foreign debt by Rs. 37.6 million

comprised a receipt of Rs. 44.5 million under foreign loan agreements offset by re­

payments of Rs. 3.9 million of I.B.R.D. loans, Rs. 1.0 million of Chinese loan, Rs. 1.3

million of Canadian loan and Rs.0.7 million of D.L.F.loans. Abreakdownby sources

Sinking Funds:—The value of sinking funds for the redemption of public debt

stood-at Rs. 351.8 million as at the close of the financial year 1961/62. Compared

with the figures as at the close of the financial year 1960/61 this registered an increase

of Rs. 33.5 million. A sum of Rs. 26.3 million was withdrawn to repay the 1\ per

cent National Development Loan, 1960/62 which matured in 1962. The budgetary

contributions to sinking funds for the year amounted to Rs. 37.9 million and interest

earnings on investments amounted to Rs. 12.0 million. The market value of invest­

ments held by sinking funds showed an increase of Rs. 9.8 million.

Borrowing by Semi-Government Institutions:—There were no issues of National

Housing Debentures in 1961/62, but the Government provided a direct loan of

Rs. 10.0 million to the National Housing Commissioner during the year, bringing the

total of direct loans by the Government to the National Housing Commissioner to

Rs. 40.0 million. The total National Housing Debentures issued and outstanding

remained at Rs. 70.0 million. The actual market value of sinking funds established

for the redemption of National Housing Debentures was Rs. 15.5 million as at the

end of the financial year.

There were no issues of Stage Mortgage Bank debentures in 1961/62. The bank

continued to have recourse to overdrafts from the commercial banks to carry out

its operations. The limit to total indebtedness of the bank which was Rs. 60.0 million

in 1960/61 was increased to Rs. 65 million by the Minister under Section 35 of State

Mortgage Bank Act, in March 1962. The debentures issued and outstanding amounted

to Rs. 45.8 million while the overdrafts guaranteed and outstanding amounted to

Rs. 9.3 million as at September 30, 1962.

The sources of finance for the budget deficit of Rs. 463.3 million indicated by the Finance Minister were Rs. 180 million from domestic market borrowing and Rs. 150 million from foreign aid leaving an imbridged gap of Rs. 133.3 million.

Two proposals made in the Budget Speech, viz. a Sales Tax estimated to yield Rs. 90 mn. and a reduction in the quantum of rationed rice by one pound per person estimated to save Rs. 25.5 mn. on the food subsidy bill were subsequently withdrawn. In lieu of the Sales Tax, a 20% increase on existing rates of import duty estimated to yield Rs. 50 mn. was imposed on a wide range of imports.

Subsequently certain new financial measures were referred to by the Minister of Finance in a speech in the House of Representatives on February 21,1963. The new measures were as follows:—

(a) Withdrawal of rice ration coupons from paddy producers estimated to yield Rs. 40 million; (b) Withdrawal of the subsidy on maldive fish estimated to yield Rs. 5 million; (c) One per cent fee on import licences estimated to yield Rs. 6 million; and (d) Other economies to be effected by the Food Commissioner's Department estimated to yield Rs. 10 million.

The economies to be brought about by the Food Commissioner's Department are as follows:—

(a) Issue of paddy instead of rice on the ration in certain provinces; and (b) Revision of the selling price of rationed rice, flour and sugar throughout the island to include transport charges from Colombo.

On March 8, 1963, the Minister of Commerce, Trade, Food and Shipping announced in the House of Representatives the suspension of the implementation of the scheme for the withdrawal of rice coupons from paddy producers.

The selling price of sugar was also increased by 5 cents per pound with effect from February 15, 1963. This measure was not expected to change the size of the food subsidy bill as it was offset by an increase in the import price of sugar.

( 98 )

Revenue

The originally estimated revenue of Rs. 1716.9 million which is Rs. 91.6 million more than the actual revenue for 1961/62, included Rs. 94.5 million from new taxa­tion measures proposed in the Budget.

Of the Rs. 94.5 million expected from new tax measures, Rs. 77.3 million was attributable to higher import duties. Apart from the general increase of 20 per cent on existing rates of duty, the Budget announced higher duties in respect of a large number of items, particularly cement, certain types of textiles, kerosene oil, radio spare parts, eggs, fruit juices, iron and steel goods, writing and printing paper other than newsprint, beer and 'luxury' foods.

Other measures included an increase in the surcharge on income tax from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, estimated to yield Rs. 10 million, excise duties on items which were hitherto not liable to excise estimated to yield Rs. 5.6 million and increa­sed licence fees under the Motor Traffic Act, estimated to yield Rs. 1 million.

Revision of the Direct Tax System

Along with the Budget speech the Finance Minister announced a scheme for the revision of the system of direct taxation to be effective from the Income Tax assess­ment year commencing on April 1, 1963. Under the new scheme there are only four direct taxes viz. the Income Tax, the Wealth Tax, the Gifts Tax and Estate Duty. The following taxes were to be abolished—The Expenditure Tax, Land Tax, National Development Tax, Professions and Businesses Registration Tax, Rice Subsidy Tax, Surtax and the Surcharge on Income Tax. Under the new scheme Income Tax will be on a sharper scale commencing at 15 per cent and rising to 80 per cent instead of the previous rates which went up from 5 per cent to 60 per cent. Further, the tax free allowances for wife and children as well as the slabs are smaller. While the new scheme is expected to simplify the tax administration to a considerable extent the total revenue from direct taxes is not expected to be affected.

With regard to companies, besides the 33 1 /3 per cent refundable tax (dividends tax), there will be a non-refundable tax of 57 per cent in place of the 45 per cent non-refundable Income Tax, the Surcharge on Income Tax, the Land Tax and the Companies Tax. Non-resident companies will continue to pay an additional 6 per cent as at present.

With a view to encouraging productive investment, relief at the effective rate of tax is to be allowed in respect of investments in new industries approved by Govern­ment and in government loans subject to certain safeguards. The maximum relief allowable will be Rs. 25,000 and the investment in respect of which relief is allowed is not to exceed l/5th of the assessable income of the individual. With a view to giving some measure of relief to the plantation industries, they are to be treated as 'approved projects' for the purpose of granting an extra 40 per cent development rebate. Thus plant and machinery, buildings to house labour, and welfare buildings will qualify for once and for all allowances as follows :

Plant and Machinery 106 2/3% Labour and welfare buildings 73 1/3%

( 99 )

Current Expenditure

The total of the recurrent expenditure votes (i.e. 1, 2, 4 & 6) amount to Rs. 1706.9 million. When items of a capital nature under recurrent expenditure and provisions for sinking fund contributions are deducted from this figure, the resultant current expenditure amounts to Rs. 1585.4 million. This figure is Rs. 90.0 million higher than the actual expenditure for 1961-62. This increase is due mainly to higher provisions for interest on public debt, pensions, health, education, defence and economic development.

Capital Expenditure

The original estimates of capital expenditure (i.e. the total of votes 3, 5 and 7) amounts to Rs. 473.3 million. When capital items under the votes of recurrent expenditure and other extra-budgetary capital expenditure from reserves are added, total capital expenditure amounts to Rs. 570.3 million. This figure is Rs. 25.7 million lower than the actual expenditure for 1961/62. This is mainly due to lower provisions made in the budget for loans to Government agencies such as the Ceylon Transport Board and the Port (Cargo) Corporation.

Of the expected receipt of Rs. 150 million of foreign aid, detailed allocations have been made in respect of Rs. 122.5 million. The largest item is the I.B.R.D. loan for the Hydro-electricity project, amounting to Rs. 40.5 million. The other main allocations are in respect of aid from the U.S.S.R., China, U.S.A., Canada, Britain and West Germany. Of the total sum allocated Rs. 93.3 million is by way of loans and Rs. 29.2 million is by way of grants.

On February 8, 1963, the United States Government announced the suspension of aid to Ceylon under the Foreign Assistance Act of the U.S.A. The impact of this decision will be the withdrawal of the Development Loan Fund dollar loan for the Katunayake Airport scheme. The estimated expenditure for 1962-63 from this loan was Rs. 3.8 million. The suspension will not affect rupee grants out of counterpart funds amounting to Rs. 9.0 million allocated to the 1962-63 Budget.

The supply of flour under P.L. 480 and the supply of flour and milk under the C.A.R.E. programme do not come within the ambit of the Foreign Assistance Act.

The estimated receipt of Rs. 180 million from domestic market borrowing compares with Rs. 197.3 million and Rs. 147.3 million borrowed from domestic non-bank sources in 1960-61 and 1961-62 respectively. During the first five months of 1962-63, Rs. 138 -7 million was received from domestic market borrowing. Of this receipt Rs. 90.5 million came from non-bank sources.
