Obviously the original estimate based on the higher duties had been an over-estimate which did not take into account a decline in consumption.

The shortfall was almost entirely in respect of the Registration of Professions and Businesses tax which yielded only Rs. 3 million as against an esti\u00admated Rs. 37 million. Professions and businesses earning an annual income of less than Rs. 3600 per annum, which were included for this tax in the original estimate, were exempted in the final legislation: This and administrative delays could be regarded as contributing to the shortfall in the revenue from this source.",

This automatically resulted in a higher profit as white sugar was being sold at a price 7 cts. above that of raw sugar. The retail selling price of white sugar was raised by 5 cents per pound by the 1961-62 Budget, but the old price was subsequently restored in Decem\u00adber 1961. The increase in the total subsidy on rice (both consumer and producer subsidy) was considerably lower than the increase in previous years. This is accounted for by a reduction in the sales of rationed rice (by Government to retail distri\u00adbutors) and a smaller increase than in previous years in purchases under the Guaran\u00adteed Price Scheme. The reduced volume of sales of rationed rice is attributable partly to a lower level of stock holding by retail distributors as a result of Government policy and partly to the surrender of rice ration books by income tax payers in order to obtain relief from the rice ration book tax which was introduced by the 1961/62 Budget.",

When capital items under the votes of recurrent expenditure and other extra-budgetary capital expenditure from reserves are added, total capital expenditure amounts to Rs. 570.3 million. This figure is Rs. 25.7 million lower than the actual expenditure for 1961/62. This is mainly due to lower provisions made in the budget for loans to Government agencies such as the Ceylon Transport Board and the Port (Cargo) Corporation.",
