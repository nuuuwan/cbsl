First, the customs returns show a decline of Rs. 41 million in the total of imports of rice, flour and sugar, in contrast with increased payments of Rs. 42 million for the same commodities in 1962. The difference is to be explained by the administrative delays in the recording in the Customs Returns even of food shipments which had already arrived in Ceylon and secondly by the lagged arrival in Ceylon of some of the foodstuffs paid for in 1962. Second, payments for other government imports which showed a substantial rise of Rs. 45 million according to balance of payments data, also stand in marked contrast with a decline of Rs. 12 million revealed in government imports classified in the Customs Returns as \"imports, civil and defence\". In their case too the difference between the two sets of figures is to be explained by the same factors as in the case of government's food imports.",

With this lag in payments, when there is a declining trend in imports in evidence, the amount of the decline in each time period will be less marked according to the payments data. The total decline in import payments will be even less, if the normal time lag in payments tends to be reduced. The latter too occurred in 1962, as a result of imports through bilateral accounts becoming a larger propor\u00adtion of total imports. When imports are made through bilateral accounts, the 'payment' i.e., the crodit to the exporting country is made in the account, normally when the goods are placed on board ship by the exporter. This means that the usual lag in payments is reversed and the import payments have been made even before the arrival of the goods in Ceylon.",

In 1962, the method of financing the deficit followed the same pattern as in 1961. The major portion of the deficit was financed through a further increase in Ceylon's foreign liabilities, necessitating only a relatively small fall in external assets. The main increase in Ceylon's foreign liabilities occurred as a result of the drawing of Rs. 53.8 million in foreign exchange from the International Monetary Fund, in February 1962. Gross long-term borrowings from I.B.R.D., Development Loan Fund, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany and the U.S.S.R., also amounted to Rs. 45.9 million. On the other hand, the major part (of Rs. 11.6 million) of the increase (of Rs. 21.3 million) in Ceylon's short-term liabilities which had occurred in 1961, was repaid in 1962.",

The surplus with the rest of the Sterling Area countries, mainly Burma and Australia registered in 1961, turned into a deficit of Rs. 43.1 million in 1962. The deterioration in the current account position with the rest of the Sterling Area was due to higher import payments to the area as well as reduced export earnings from the area.",

Thus, the following comments made in the 1961 Report still remain appropriate \" the external reserve position (at the end of the year) cannot be considered for a number of reasons to have been satisfactory. Firstly, because of the increased foreign liabilities incurred; secondly, because of the increased vulnerability of export prices; and thirdly, because of the increased demand for imports, particularly of capital goods, which will arise as the pace of economic development is intensified. Therefore, a continuation of the policy of restraints over imports and other foreign payments along with stronger measures to curtail the domestic monetary expansion is required\".",
