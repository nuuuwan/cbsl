Thus the relatively high rate of increase in gross national product in money terms in 1962 as compared with 1961 is partly attributable to the lower rate of decline in export prices.",

The value added by domestic production in the sector 'agriculture, forestry, livestock and fisheries' was higher in 1962 by 3.6 per cent in comparison with 1961. This is a more favourable rate of increase than in the previous year, although not as good as in 1960. The value added by domestic production in the field of industrial consumer goods was higher by 19 per cent in 1962 in comparison with 1961. This is about the same rate of increase as in 1960 and is rather higher than the rate of increase in 1961. It will be seen from Table II A\u20142 that capital development in 1962 has been a little higher than in either of the two previous years, due mainly to a very large increase in capital development by public enterprises. Capital development by the private sector and public corporations taken together was, in fact, lower in 1962 than in 1961, while capital development by Government was only slightly higher. In the service sectors of the economy 'transport and communication', 'ownership of dwel\u00adlings' and 'trade' registered rates of increase in 1962 that were above the average rate of increase for the year in gross domestic product.",

Table II A\u20144, which reconciles the separately derived estimates of gross national product and gross national expenditure, shows, however, that there are overall discrepancies between the product and expen\u00additure aggregates of the magnitudes indicated by Item 13 of the Table. The magni\u00adtude of the discrepancy for 1962 is Rs. 72 million. This is rather higher than that for the two previous years, though lower than that for 1959. As both Customs and Balance of Payments data have been used in the preparation of the product and expenditure tables, it is possible that the increase in magnitude of the discrepancy for 1962 is partly due to the wide divergence between Customs and Balance of Payments data on merchandise imports during the year.",

It appears from this classification: that the increase in capital formation in 1962 was concentrated largely in the fields, of plant and machinery and of transport. equipment. In the case of Government-, and public enterprises, taken together, there was a rise in capital formation in fixed assets of 10.8 per cent in 1962 as against a decline of 4.9 per cent the previous year. The Table also shows that (identifiable) stocks in the private sector* fell by Rs. 38 million in 1962. In the public sector, stocks of imported rice, wheat flour and sugar fell by as much as Rs. 87 million. This was partially compensated for, how\u00adever, by an increase in stocks of Guaranteed Price Scheme paddy to the value of Rs. 45 million. -",

At market value the decline was smaller, from 43.0 per cent in 1959 to 38.9 per cent in 1962. The smaller rate of decline in the import content of private consumption at market value, as opposed to c.i.f. prices, is, of course, not surprising in view of the steady increases in the rates of import duty on imported consumption goods. As regards the import content of public consumption, this has shown a declining trend since 1960, though in the latter year it was higher than in 1959. Turning to examine the import content of gross domestic capital formation, a fair measure of stability is indicated by the figures. However, this stability may be more apparent than real, reflecting merely the assumptions on which the estimates of gross fixed capital formation have been based. For, large components of the estimates of total capital formation have been derived by the application of indirect methods which relate the values of capital formation to c.i.f. import values.",

However, as this high rate of increase in exports was achieved partly at the expense of a decline in stocks, the real value of actual production for export was up in 1962 by only 3.2 per cent. This is in contrast to a rate of increase in actual production for export in 1961 of 8.1 per cent. As regards production for domestic use, paddy, tea and coconut products had.a very favourable year. Whereas in,money terms their overall rate of increase;in 1962 was. 5.8 per cent, in real terms ,their rate of increase was 8.8 per cent.* This real rate of,increase of 8.8 per cent in 1962 compares with a rate of increase of only 1.2 per. cent the. previous ^year.,As .regards.

The gross national income at 1959 prices is seen, to have been lower than the gross national product at 1959 prices in each of the years 1960 to 1962 on account of the unfavourable terms of trade in these years as compared with 1959. However, the terms of trade improved in 1962 relatively to the position in 1961. As a result the real national income turned out to be 5.3 per cent higher in 1962 than in 1961 although the real national product was only 4.^0 per cent higher. The measure of the increase in real national expenditure in 1962 is also 5.3 per cent, considering that national expenditure in real terms is conceptually indistinguishable from national income in real terms except for the change in the basis of valuation from factor cost to market prices.",

At constant 1959 prices the rise was 6.0 per cent. In the case of rubber, which had declined substantially in export value in 1961, the year 1962 showed a fair recovery, though not quite up to the high level of 1960. The recovery in 1962 over the previous year amounted to 11 per cent at current prices and over 13 per cent at constant 1959 prices. In the case of coconut products, a continued rise in production enabled Rs. 27 million more of foreign exchange to be realised from this source in 1962 than in 1961.",

    "text": "1.... In the^estimate of capital formation by the \"private sector and public corporations\" . in Tables II A\u20143 and,II A'\u20147, there has been one major change. The estimation of the important item \"building and certain other construction\" (Table II A\u20147) has been based since 1952 on the application of a fector (equal to 10/3) to the current c.i.f. value of imports of constructional materials. It has thus been assumed that the value of capital formation in \"building and certain other construction\" has a constant relationship to c.i.f. import values of constructional materials. While this assumption may have had some validity in the early nineteen-fifties, it is likely that developments in recent years have rendered this assumption increasingly unrealistic. There is reason to believe that imported constructional materials at c.i.f. values now form a somewhat smaller proportion of the value of capital formation than they used to around the year 1952. One factor that has changed the situation has been the increased local production of cement. In the present estimates, allowance has been made for this development by adding on the ex-factory value of cement to the c.i.f. value of imports of constructional materials before application of the 10/3 factor to derive the estimate of capital formation in \"building and certain other construction\". Even with this modification, the estimates of capital formation continue to be of very doubtful reliability. While radical changes in the methods of estimation of capital formation are an urgent necessity, they will, however, have to await the conduct of a properly designed survey of private investment in Ceylon.",

The total of import duties has been likewise allocated. One particular consequence of this exhaustive classification of imports and import duties has been the improved estimation of purchases of local goods and services by Government (which is a negative item in the assessment of private consumption in Table II A\u20143). Purchases of local goods and services by Government are now estimated as a residual by comparing total public consumption, on the one hand, with the total net output of Government, on the other, and deducting Government purchases of imported goods and services from the resulting difference. It is believed that the introduction of this method of estimating Government local purchases has had the effect of eliminating a certain measure of double counting hitherto present between public and private consumption.",

This is because it is considered that the price indices used for purposes of deflation have become inoreasigly unrealistic in recent years. In regard to the production of goods and services for domestic use, some of the detailed items of the Colombo Consumers' Price Index hitherto used as deflators appear to present a .biased picture of true movemsnts in prices. For example, the transport item of this index (which reflects largely the prices of various subsidized forms of public passenger transport) is no longer",

    "text": "The whole question of the construction of realistic deflators is at present under consideration and, pending a final settlement on this matter, a very approximate method has been used in this Annual Report to. derive .estimates.of reaLproduct, income and expenditure. In .the case of the estimates of real national product presented here, production for export, arid also the production for domestic use of paddy, tea and coconut products, have been precisely revalued at oonstant 1959 prices on the basis of data on actual quantities produced. The net output of Government has. been deflated by the minimum wage rate index for Central Government employees (this index, incidentally, has shown no change during the period 1959 to 1962). The remainder of net output has been deflated by the domestic group sub-index of the Colombo Consumers' Price Index as a rough, and admittedly rather crude, substitute for the aggregation of the constant price values of the several different items involved. While this procedure has the defects, first, that the sub-index used reflects the movements of retail prices rather than of producers' prices and, second, that the weightage of the items in the sub-index differs from that of the items in the National Product Table, still perhaps it presents a more realistic picture of price movements than may be obtained by a detailed application of the other price indices available.",
