The volume of imports, according to the Central Bank's index of volume of all imports, increased by 1.1 per cent, the Bank's index rising by one point to 92. The separate indices for the major categories of imports show that, while investment goods and inter\u00admediate goods increased in volume by 13.7 per cent and 11.0 per cent respectively, the volume of consumer goods declined by 6.0 per cent. Within the consumer goods category, the sharpest decline was in the 'other consumer goods' group, viz., 8.2 per cent, while 'food and drink' and 'textiles' declined by 6.2 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively.",

    "text": "In 1962 production of tea expanded by 12 million pounds or 2.6 per cent, a rate of growth that was less rapid than during the two preceding years. The volume of exports expanded much faster. Prices, however, continued to be unsatisfactory. The average price of all teas at the Colombo Auctions declined .by 8 cents (4.4 per cent), a sharper fall than in the previous year. Indeed, with the exception of the last quarter of the year, when it was noticeably higher, the average price realized in each quarter was much lower than during the corresponding period of the previous year. However, the behaviour of prices of the three grades of tea was not uniform. The average price of high growns improved slightly by 3 cents (1.5 per cent) over the year. Prices reached a peak in March, fell steeply to June, rose somewhat rapidly to September, with the seasonal improvement in quality, and tailed off towards the end of the year. The average price of medium growns fell by 11 cents (6.4 per cent) over the year, while that of low growns fell even more sharply, viz., by 18 cents (10.3 per cent). The prices of these two grades of tea were depressed for the most part of the year. Two factors which contributed to this depression in price were the reduction in April, 1962 in the Indian export duty on tea from 44 naya paise per kilogram to 25 naya paise per kilogram, which appeared to affect adversely the prices of all but the best of Ceylon's teas, and the difficulties experienced in some of the Middle Eastern markets, e.g. Iran, particularly in regard to the necessity to expand trade with those countries on the basis of more or less strictly reciprocal deals. These prices, however, received a temporary stimulus during the last quarter, with the strike of Pakistani crews on the Brahmaputra river and, later, the tension caused by the Sino-Indian border dispute, factors which tended to disrupt the flow of North Indian teas to Calcutta.",

Exports increased faster in contrast to the sharp decline experienced during the previous year. The average Colombo market price for R.S.S. No. 1 rubber reached its lowest level since 1950, declining by 3 cents (3.0 per cent) over the previous year. The international market for rubber was for the most part characterized by dull conditions, although from time to time it reacted with nervousness and uncertainty to particular events including announcements regarding United States stockpile disposals and deve\u00adlopments in the international political situation. Prices improved appreciably early in the year, due to the tension between the Dutch and Indonesians over West Irian (West New Guinea) and to sustained heavy purchases presumably by Russia. Thereafter, prices tended to decline steadily, and during the early part of June",

    "text": "The big fact confronting the natural rubber industry is the prospect of intensified competition from the synthetic product in the years ahead. The increasing versatility of the new synthetic rubbers is undoubtedly reducing the area in which natural rubber has hitherto had a unique application. Competition, therefore, is likely to be the principal determinant of the relative shares of the two products in the future total demand for rubber. While price must constitute the foremost element of competition, other factors, such as uniformity and cleanliness of material and packing and- presentation of product, are of considerable importance, and there appears to be growing evidence that in this regard natural rubber compares unfavourably with synthetic. Estimates made by the International Rubber Study Group indicate that during 1962 world production of synthetic rubber at 2,225,000 tons exceeded slightly world production of natural rubber, which amounted to 2,110,000 tons. World consumption of the former at 2,138,000 tons was, however, somewhat behind that of natural rubber, viz., 2,190,000 tons. Preliminary estimates also suggest that for 1963 world consumption as well as production of synthetic rubber are likely to exceed those of natural rubber. Indeed, consumption of natural rubber is expected to decline slightly as compared with 1962.*",

In the 'Other Consumer Goods' group imports of motor cars and radio receivers, which continue to be subject to prohibitive restrictions, declined further from the already low levels of 1961. Imports of rubber tyres and tubes increased by Rs. 3 million (14.3 per cent), notwithstanding the fact that these were brought under individual import licensing control on July 26, 1962. In the category of 'Intermediate Goods' imports of 'dyeing, tanning and colouring materials' expanded sharply byRs. 4 million (36.4 per cent), while imports of unmanufactured tobacco declined by Rs. 3 million (23.1 per cent). There were no significant changes, as compared with the previous year, in imports of fertilizers, petroleum products and coal, items which continued to be freely importable under Open General Licence. In the 'Investment Goods' category, there were rather sharp declines in imports of 'transport equipment' and 'machinery and equipment', viz., Rs. 7 million (30.4 per cent) and Rs. 4 million (19.0 per cent) respectively, while imports of'building materials' rose by Rs. 7 million (9.9 per cent).

In terms of 1962 imports the corresponding coverage was approximately Rs. 407 million or 25 per cent of total imports during the year. The value of imports covered by these restrictions was less by Rs. 98 million in 1962 than in the previous year. The restrictions introduced on October 10, 1962 increased sharply the area of coverage, which now amounted, in terms of 1961 and 1962 imports, to Rs. 811 million and Rs. 807 million respectively or 48% and 49% of the total value of imports of those respective years.",

In the absence of comprehensive data, it is difficult to assess with any great degree of accuracy their impact on actual imports during 1962. In the first place, quotas are not announced in respect of every item brought under individual licence. Secondly, Customs statistics do not always lend themselves to identification of the particular items (often of relatively small magnitude or differently classified) selected for quantitative restriction. There does, however, appear to be evidence that in the case of some of the items concerned, licensing action has been considerably offset by abnormally large orders for goods placed by importers in anticipation of restrictions.",

On August 3,1962, following the withdrawal of the sales tax introduced a few days earlier, duties were increased by 20 per cent on all imports other than food for human consumption excluding drink, dangerous petroleum, kerosene oil, crude petroleum and those items which were affected by the increases announced on July 26, 1962. This increase affected imports which accounted for approximately Rs. 863 million of imports during 1961 or 51 per cent of that year's imports. Both increases were part of the corrective measures taken to curtail domestic monetary expansion and restrain demand, including the demand for imports.",
