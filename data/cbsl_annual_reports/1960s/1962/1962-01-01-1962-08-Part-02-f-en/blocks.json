In December, the currency issue rose to Rs. 789.4 million due to the seasonal increase in the demand for currency and increased consumer expenditure during the month. The trend during 1962 tends to show that the tendency for the currency issue to increase relatively to demand deposits has been somewhat arrested and with the expansion of banking facilities in the country it is very likely to improve the position. Commercial bank deposits with the Central Bank rose by Rs. 20.1 million from Rs. 86.6 million to Rs. 106.7 million. The increase in these deposits was largely due to an overall increase in deposits in the banking system during the year with the result that banks had to maintain additional reserves against them. Deposits of international organisations and of foreign governments and foreign banking institu\u00adtions rose sharply by Rs. 59.5 million from Rs. 128.4 million to Rs. 187.9 million. These deposits increased sharply from Rs. 126.5 million in January to Rs. 179.8 million in February and again from Rs. 179.0 million in November to Rs. 187.9 million in December. The increase in these deposits was largely the result of the purchase of Rs. 53.8 million of foreign exchange from the International Monetary Fund in February 1962. With the increase in the total currency issue and other demand liabilities and the fall in the international reserve the ratio of the internatio\u00adnal reserve to currency and liabilities fell sharply from 18-7 per cent to 13-9 per cent. In any of the previous years the ratio of the international reserve to currency and demand liabilities had not fallen to this level.",

In December 1962, the Central Bank revised the restrictions on credit by commercial banks for the financing of the purchase of estates and properties in Ceylon owned by non-nationals. The Monetary Board of the Central Bank directed that commercial bank credit to residents in Ceylon or companies registered in Ceylon for the purchase of estates whether foreign owned or not, should not exceed 33 1/3% of the purchase price of the estate. This restriction was also made applicable to bank credit to residents in Ceylon or companies registered in Ceylon for the purchase of other immovable property (other than estates) belonging to a person resident outside Ceylon or a company incorporated outside Ceylon.",

Due to the cessation of normal banking business during the period of the bank dispute, overdrafts and import bills rose substantially. The most marked increase occurred in overdrafts which rose from Rs. 300.4 million to Rs. 415.4 million in February 1962 and increased further to Rs. 445.9 million in April; thereafter, overdrafts declined steadily to the present level. The increase in overdrafts during the first 5 months of the year was largely due to the extension of credit by the commercial banks to individuals and firms mainly on the basis of uncleared cheques and other assets in their possession. Loans, on the other hand, decreased during this period because the banks provided credit facilities to their customers mainly in the form of overdrafts. Export bills rose during this period because bills could not be paid due to the temporary suspension of normal banking operations. The fall in overdrafts during the year is principally due to the reduced volume of credit being provided for imports on account of a lower level of imports of consumer goods. Loans, on the other hand, have increased partly because a few banks are now lending to their customers for substantially longer periods for purposes such as housing construction and the financing of newly established industrial undertakings in the country.",

The only exception was in December 1962 when excess reserves increased from Rs. 1.3 million to Rs. 9.6 million. During the first five months of the year excess reserves increased principally due to the increase in commercial bank deposits with the Central Bank, which has been explained earlier in this section. During the year the commercial banks increasingly used the provision whereby they could set apart, a part of their till cash as required reserves. In the second half of the year, on the average, the amount of till cash utilised as reserves was around Rs. 15 million. From September the Table showing required reserves in the Central Bank bulletin and the Annual Report has been revised to show the reserve position of the commercial banks more accurately.

    "text": "During the half year ending June 1962 total advances rose by Rs. 26.3 million from Rs. 548.6 million to Rs. 574.9 million. Advances to industry rcse by Rs. 7.5 million from Rs. 24.0 million to Rs. 31.5 million, advances for consumption rose by Rs. 5.5 million from Rs. 32.7 million to Rs. 38.2 million, while \"other loans\" rose by Rs. 3.7 million from Rs. 13.4 million to Rs. 17.1 million. Commercial advances rose by Rs. 12.0 million from Rs. 379.2 million to Rs. 391.2 million, financial advances fell by Rs. 3.9 million from Rs. 88.7 million in December 1961 to Rs. 84.8 million in June 1962; advances for agriculture also rose by Rs. 1.4 million from Rs. 10.6 million to Rs. 12.0 million. The increase in commercial finance has been largely due to the increasing de\u00admands made by the export trade for finance from the banks. The fall in financial advances reflects the overall reduction in the level of bank credit for financing hire purchase transactions either directly or through other hire purchase companies. The increase in consumption loans to Rs. 38.2 million, which is Rs. 8 million above the figure for September 1961 is significant because these loans have increased despite the fall in the imports of a large variety of durable consumption goods. It is probable that since personal loans are also classified under this category the increase in this total may be due to a rise in the latter item. As between September 1961 and June 1962, the percentage of credit given for commercial purposes has fallen from 70.3 to 68.0 per cent showing that the banks have to some extent diverted credit away from their customary fields. Agricultural advances have increased from 1.9 per cent of the total volume of bank advances to 2 per cent while advances for industrial purposes have increased from 5.1 to 5.5 per cent during the same period. The above data show that the total amount of credit made available by commercial banks to new domestic and agricultural enterprises has not increased significantly and the total volume of credit available for these purposes from the commercial banks continues to remain at a very low level.",

Whereas in the previous year total loans decreased by Rs. 0.8 million in the year under review the fall was Rs. 1.0 million. As in the previous year the Corporation has made new loans entirely out of capital repayments because the resources available to the Corporation have not increased. The total value of loans granted for agricultural purposes during the year was Rs. 2.0 million as against Rs. 2.6 million in 1961. Loans granted for industrial purposes decreased by Rs. 0.3 million from Rs. 0.6 million in 1961 to Rs. 0.3 million in 1962. These figures show that the Corporation has continued its previous policy of financing agriculture and industry even with the limited resources at its disposal. The total loans outstanding of the State Mortgage Bank also show a trend similar to that of the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation. In 1961 the total loans of the State Mortgage Bank increased by Rs. 0.2 million but in 1962 the total fell by Rs. 0.4 million from Rs. 56.3 million to Rs. 55.9 million. As the State Mortgage Bank has also not had access to new loan funds, loans given by the institution have been financed out of capital repayments. Unlike in the previous year the Bank did not issue any deben\u00adtures, the latter accounted for the decrease in loans in the current year as against an increase in the previous year.",
