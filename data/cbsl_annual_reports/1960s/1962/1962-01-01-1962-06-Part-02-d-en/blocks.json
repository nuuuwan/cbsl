In addition nearly 35 per cent of the workers in the rural areas and 20 per cent of the workers in the urban areas were either seasonally unemployed or had work of uncertain regularity.1",

In the absence of such data the only rough indicator of the annual movement in the level of unemployment is the data relating to the number of registrants at employment exchanges. At the end of 1961, the number of registrants at employment exchanges was 0.1 per cent higher than in the previous year. These numbers have been increasing slightly in 1962, so that at the end of December 1962, these regis\u00adtrants numbered 152,209 compared with 151,265 at the end of December 1961. The number of registrants at employment exchanges was lowest in the second quarter of 1962. During the course of the year there was a steady increase in registration by persons seeking technical and clerical employment, so that at the end of the year these registrants numbered 22.4 per cent more than at the end of December 1961. The number of skilled and semi-skilled registrants remained relatively stable. The number of unskilled registrants, however, declined steadily during the course of the year and were 8.1 per cent lower than at the end of the previous year.",

The number of strikes in other employments showed little change. The largest number of strikes, however, still took place in the plantation sector where the major part of the working popu\u00adlation organised in unions is employed. About 67.5 per cent of plantation workers are members of unions and their numbers constitute about 58.2 per cent of all employees, who are members of unions. In 1962, the number of strikes on planta\u00adtions and other employment totalled 130 and 38 compared with 90 and 39 respect\u00adively in 1961. In the plantation sector the number of workers involved was also larger than in the previous year but the numbsr of man-days lost was relatively lower. In other employment too a larger number of employees were involved but strikes were longer drawn out than in recent years, so that the number of man-days lost increased from 170,372 in 1961 to 726,356 in 1962. Of the number of man-days lost 530,767 man-days were lost on account of the strike by employees in the dock, harbour and port transport trade alone. The number of man-days lost as a result of the Bank employees strike was 165,850.",
