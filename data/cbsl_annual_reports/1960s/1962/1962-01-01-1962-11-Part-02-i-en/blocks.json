    "text": "Industrial activity in Ceylon during 1962 showed an unmistakable quickening in tempo, but it is too early to evaluate in overall terms the practical effect of this on the volume of domestic production and employment. While a sizeable proportion of the industrial investment initiated has still to lead up to the point of commercial production, limitations in the scope and reliability of statistics for this sector of the economy preclude a composite picture being drawn of industrial trends during the period. In the case of the State Industrial Corporations, even when up-to-date information is available, there exist problems of comparability of data and their aggregation, due chiefly to a lack of uniformity in the presentation of financial accounts; in the private sector, on the other hand, the rapid emergence of a considerable number of small enterprises, makes the assembling of data difficult, partly owing to the weak response of such enterprises to statistical enquiries. The following account of current industrial trends therefore seeks mainly to highlight some of the more apparent features of the expansion that has taken place both in the public and private sectors.",

Though conceived in the context of an expansion programme, more realistic investment and production targets than before were laid down. Many of the existing Corporations have con\u00adsciously directed their effort towards achieving a closer degree of inter-industry co-ordination and towards a fuller utilization of their plant and equipment. In some cases this has entailed expanding investment in related branches of manu\u00adfacture. A further reduction of average production costs has also been planned through a policy of extended mechanization, with parallel investments, for example, in materials handling and transport. Brief notes indicative of the operational trends of selected State Corporations are given below.",

Each of these has a factory building together with office space, an enclosed paved yard for vehicles, and access from the main roadway to the factory. All industrial units are provided with water, power and sewerage.

The total number employed in the Corporation during 1962 was 345, or nearly 16 per cent more than the number in 1961. These changes in production have been the result of an expansion programme for foot-wear involving the construction of a new shoe factory. The total capital of the Corporation was increased in 1962 by a sum of Rs. 3.5 mn. obtained as a loan from Government. Most of this sum has already been invested in the new shoe factory, and the full impact of the expansion programme on output would be felt during 1963.",

The limitation of production was due partly to the Corporation having to engage itself on construction work and partly to the non-availability hitherto of sufficient export outlets for ilmenite. The small consignment of ilmenite exported during the year was sent to Japan and negotiations for larger orders are proceeding. Given sufficient outlets, the Corporation can expand its output with the existing machinery by introducing three shifts of production instead of one \u2022 shift as at present.",

About the end of 1958 a technical and administrative re-organisation was initiated, leading to an increase in its fixed capital during 1962. The losses are attributable, however, to the relatively low prices paid for Government purchases as well as to an unsold stock of paper of substantial value, amounting at the end of the last accounting year to Rs. 7 million or to nearly a year's production. The cost of manufacturing paper has, in fact, steadily declined from Rs. 2,039 per ton (ex stores Colombo) in 1959 to Rs. 1,600 per ton in 1962.

By solving the problems of transport and handling, a sufficient and un-interrupted supply of paddy straw for the paper mill has been ensured. Machinery has also been installed for the manufacture of exercise books capable of supplying the Island's present requirements. The Corporation has, however, restricted the quantity of exercise books manufactured, in order not to encroach upon the market prospects of private manufacturers; the latter are, in fact, entitled to a special price for paper supplied by the Corporation if such paper is used for exercise books. The Corporation is exploring export markets for its exercise books and inquiries have already been had from Burma and Africa.",

In view of the constancy in the fixed capital employed by the Corporation during the past few years and in the face of a slight decline in its total labour force in 1962, the increased output has clearly been due to a greater utilisation of installed capacity. Whereas the output of chlorine exceeds the Island's present requirements (the excess having to be 'neutralised'), the increased output of caustic soda has had an import-saving effect; the Corporation's output of caustic soda in 1962 amounted to 40% of total requirements, compared with a ratio of 23% for 1961.",

Realisation of this target is based upon an expansion of the Kankesan cement works, and the establish\u00adment of a clinker grinding plant at Galle and a second cement plant at Puttalam. The manufacture of several cement products is also envisaged. These include telephone kiosks, telegraph posts and cable duets.",

    "text": "The sugar factory in Kantalai had an output of 1,044 tons of sugar in 1962, or nearly one half of one per cent of the Island's requirements in 1962. (The output of sugar by the Gal Oya Development Board in 1961-62 was 2,541 tons). Though the Corporation's sugar output in 1962 represents an improvement over the two preceding years, the factory still produces far below its existing capacity, rated at about 14 thousand tons. The basic limitations to its operations, leading to un\u00adeconomic production costs, is a shortage in the supply of sugar cane. This has been due both to manpower problems, especially in sugar cane harvesting, and to certain natural impediments. The former arises largely from the pronounced seasona\u00adlity in labour requirements, which often correspond with the paddy cultivation cycle; the latter relate to an inadequacy of water and to damage to the standing crop by elephants. As a solution to the first problem the Corporation has recognized the need to at least partially mechanize cane harvesting. Apart from seriously res\u00adtricting the area of cane planted, the shortage of labour has led to insufficient attention to certain cultural operations and to a consequent persistence of relatively low yields. The recovery ratio of manufactured sugar from sugar cane increased to 8.6 per cent in 1961 from a figure of 4 per cent initially; sugar cane trials conducted in Kantalai, however, have shown the possibility of a recovery rate of 10 per cent.",

The technical and economic advantages relating particularly to power supplies for the fertilizer plant have dictated the need to co-ordinate the construction programme for the petroleum refinery with that for the fertilizer plant. Detailed specifications for the refinery are to be soon com\u00adpleted. Construction work on the hardware project is scheduled to begin this year.

Although the number of approved medium and large-scale projects tended to fall every half-year, the size of the projects approved after 1961 has increased. The estimated capital per enterprise for the projects approved in each of the three half-yearly periods from July-December 1961 was respectively Rs. 549,000, Rs. 716,000 and Rs. 951,000. This sequence, based on the short period for which data are available, may suggest a tendency for private industrial enterprise to initially engage in projects that require small amounts of capital, leaving out the relatively large industries for a later date.",
