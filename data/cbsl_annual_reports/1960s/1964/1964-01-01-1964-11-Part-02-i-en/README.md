(a) Overall Trends

The aggregate value of industrial output at current prices as given by a Central Bank survey of manufacturing firms showed a very substantial increase during 1964 over the corresponding figure for 1963. The increase in output value amounted to Rs. 105-8 million compared with the rise of Rs. 44-4 million in the preceding year. This increase in the value of production does not altogether reflect an expansion in real output. Shortages of imported raw materials and component parts especially towards the end of the year in fact restrained activity in certain industries causing a general rise in excess capacity.

The apparent increase in aggregate values is mainly attributable to two factors the impact of which it was not possible to estimate. One was the rise in prices during the year which contributed to the value increase; the other, the registration as business firms of many small enterprises (particularly in the Garments industry) which operated formerly on a household basis. The total number of manufacturing firms covered by the Central Bank's analysis was 717 in 1964 compared with 433 in the preceding year. Nearly one-half of the new firms covered were engaged in two industries: Garments and Metal Products. The inclusion of these firms in our tables for 1964 would have thus resulted in a value increase of a statistical nature which may to some extent overstate the actual increase in the volume of production.

The irate of expansion in the value of industrial output in this year as given by the data was 24*5 per cent compared with 11-4 per cent in 1963. If the manufactured coconut products (oil, desiccated coconut and poonac), which involve the processing of the traditional primary products and which have a high weightage in the overall value of industrial output, are excluded so as to focus attention on the new lines of manufacturing activity, the rates of increase in 1963 and 1964 over the corresponding previous years, are respectively 18-4 per cent and 31-4 per cent.

The increase in the value of production in 1964 was accompanied by an expansion of industrial employment *the real extent of which cannot be guaged owing to problems affecting the comparability of the annual data. In contrast to the garments industry in which the expansion in employment did not add significantly to the value of output, the metal products industry with its high capital intensity of production and the very high proportion of the value of materials used in production, generated little additional employment in relation to the increase in the value of output. In the garments industries while the average number of employees increased,

* The statistics of the value of industrial output given in this section are based on a survey carried out by the Bank. The number of reporting firms in 1964 were considerably greater than those whose data were taken into account in 1963. For this reason the increase in the annual value of industrial production and employment shown for 1964 must not be interpre-ted to represent the actual increase that occurred during this year. Further the annual rate of expansion given in this section is not comparable with that used in section on National Product and Expenditure. The latter estimate which, in fact, represents the value added in industry as distinguished from the change in the gross value of output, has been obtained after making a adjustment for the increased coverage of the Central Bank's industries survey in 1964.

the volume of employment as given by the man-days worked per employee declined in 1964 and was the lowest for all industries. This was due to two circumstances. Firstly, many new firms entered the industry during 1964 and these firms operated for only part of the year ; secondly, there is in this industry a preponderence of small firms which do not have a steady volume of work.

A classification of industrial production by the major economic categories, as given in Table III, shows little change compared with 1963 in the relative weightage of consumer goods, intermediate goods, and investment goods. While the proportion of consumer goods was practically unchanged (constituting 63 per cent of the total, value of industrial output), there was, however, a slight shift away from the category of intermediate goods to that of investment goods.

Among the group of manufactured consumer goods there was little or no expansion in footwear and leather products and the biscuit and confectionery industries. Market limitations appear to have imposed a ceiling on their further growth. In the confectionery industry there has been a perceivable change in the production pattern, involving a decline in the output of boiled sweets and an increased production of chocolates and toffees. Whereas the former (boiled sweets) are based almost entirely on imported materials, the latter use local materials (principally cocoa) amounting to nearly 50 per cent of the total value of materials.

Several other industries, however, continued to show increases in value, viz. tobacco, garments, miscellaneous chemical products, articles of paper and paper-bpard, and manufactured products n.e.s.. The bulk of this increase.was spread over a comparatively large range of individual products, viz,.animal feed and coconut oil, tobacco,. garments, soap, plastics, insecticides, polish, paints and varnishes, joss sticks, camphor, tooth powder, writing, paper and exercise books.

In the case of the garments industry and that of articles of paper and. paper-board the figures of the gross value of annual output exaggerate the real increase. A certain portion of the increased value of garments shown in the table, as stated already, is due to the inclusion of enterprises, whose output for earlier years is not recorded. The exaggerated nature of the increase in the value of paper and paper prducts is due, on the other hand, to an element of double counting, since writing paper, carton paper and kraft paper manufactured by the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation are used by other firms for the manufacture of products such as exercise books,envelopes, file covers and cartons.

Following a steady expansion of the metal products industry between 1960 and 1963 its growth during 1964 was abnormally rapid. The value of output in this year was Rs. 38-5 million compared with Rs. 15-1 million in 1963. The over­whelming share of this expansion was in the investment goods branch of the industry (wire fencing and. barbed wire, wire nails and galvanized products) than in the production of consumer and intermediate types,of goods (such as aluminium ware and metal containers). The considerably increased production of wire fencing, barbed wire and metal containers was associated with a reduction in imports by Rs. 2-5 million in 1964.

Imported materials are the basis of the metal products industry and their value forms a very high proportion of the normal production costs, making the foreign exchange saving from import substitution very slight. Imported raw materials used by 9 of the firms in this industry in 1964 amounted to Rs. 4-8 million compared with a total wage bill of Rs. 371 thousand. Yet local produc­tion has been profitable for two reasons. In the case of bulky goods (such as aluminium hollow-ware and metal containers used both for packaging and for the transport and storage of oil) there is a saving on shipping freight even when production is based on imported sheet metal. In the, case of other products (such as barbed wire, wire nails, staples and razor blades) profitability has been ensured by a rise in the local market prices of these products following restrictions on imports. Although the production of metal containers has shown a signifi­cant increase, the lack of standardization in the size and shape of containers used by different firms for the sale of cosmetics, confectionery and preserved fruits has restricted the possible economics of scale in local production.

Somce: Data obtained from the respective corporations

It will be seen that excepting the Chemicals, Oils and Fats and the Ply­woods corporations, all others produced more in 1964 than in 1963. The im­proved performance is to be attributed in most cases to fuller utilization of existing productive capacity; this Is to be expected in industries which are still in the early stages of development. The rise in output of the Sugar Corporation was due largely to an increase in the planted acreage. In the Paper Mills Cor­poration the increase is to be ascribed mainly to technical adjustments and improvements made on the present equipment. With the increased experience and skill gained by workers, the Ceramics Corporation has been able to turn out better and more wares.

Although production has tended to expand, in many industries it is never­theless much less than the full capacity of the installed plant and equipment.

Perhaps the most striking instance is that of the Sugar Corporation, which still produces only about one-tenth the capacity of the factory. Problems of rec­ruiting labour for harvesting and skilled staff are some of the factors impeding

further growth in production. The output of the labouring force is also low being 0-4 tons per man day compared with about 4 tons in Australia. The Oil

Mill and the Provender Plant of the Oils and Fats Corporation are similarly

functioning only at 35% and 56% respectively of rated capacity. The chief fac­

tors limiting the attainment of capacity output are the lack of satisfactory external

markets for the oil-mill by-product and the fluctuation of demand for com­

pounded poultry feeds due to stiff competition from low-cost small manufacturers.

The Paper Mills, Chemicals and Mineral Sands corporations likewise pro­duce only about 3/4 the full capacity. Although the Paper Mills Corporation does not experience much difficulty in securing local raw materials or in recrui­ting labour, the problem of absenteeism has to be met during the harvesting season. The inability of the Chemicals Corporation to find adequate markets

for its chlorine retards expansion of output to capacity levels. Production in

fact declined in 1964 due largely to two strikes and breakdown in the plant. The Plywoods Corporation's output also fell in 1964 owing to similar reasons.

The general increase in output in public sector industries had a restraining influence on production costs. In some corporations unit costs of production actually declined owing to the fixed costs being spread out over a larger output. In certain others they either remained unaltered or rose slightly, as the increased output was just counterbalanced or more than offset by a rise in wage costs and prices of raw materials and the imposition of the manufacturers' turnover

tax.

The prices charged by corporations for their products in 1964 were much the same as in 1963. Pricing policies of the various corporations present several contrasting features. The Cement, Sugar and Paper Mills Corporations tend to adopt the import prices of similar products plus duties as a basis

for price fixing. Provender of the Oils and Fats Corporation, tannery products of the Leather Corporation and products of the Ceramics and Plywoods corporations are priced on the basis of production costs plus a margin

of profit. Quite unlike most other corporations, the Leather Products Corpo­

ration faces stiff competition and hence its shoe prices have to be set at compe­titive levels. The Mineral Sands Corporation, which produces entirely for

export, has similary to accept the competitive world market prices.

The better output performance of some public sector industries in 1964 is reflected in an improvement in their financial position. The table which follows shows that all corporations but one made a larger profit (or a smaller loss) in 1964 than in 1963.

These figures are provisional and subject to audit. • Seven of the 12 corporations listed in Table 2 yeilded a profit or surplus. In 4 corporations'the surplus in fact amounted to over 5 % of the employed capital. The average rate of return' on employed capital of the 12 corporations works out at 2-76 per cent. The improvement in financial results of the corporations is an encouraging sign, for it is vital that public sector industries should yield surpluses for. further investment and • growth. The most obvious method of augmenting these surpluses is to step up output to -levels neater to capacity, for costs per unit of output will decline and the margin of profit will increase as output expands'. In most cases there is ample demand for such increased output., . 1 .. .. .

New Industrial Projects

. Progress was made on several new State industrial projects, which are now in varying degrees: of completion. The Steel Corporation's rolling mill and wire mill were under construction during the year and may be completed by early 1966. Construction work and training of personnel by the Tyre Corporation have.proceeded according to schedule and the,factory is expected to commence production in 1965 with" an annual output of 250,000 tyres. Preliminary work connected with site development and factory construction were also undertaken by the Hardware, Hardboard and Flour Milling corporations.
