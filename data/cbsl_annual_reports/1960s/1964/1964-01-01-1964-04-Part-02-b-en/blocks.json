The balance of trade, as reflected in the Customs data, recorded a deficit of Rs. 99 million. This position contrasts sharply with that of the years 1963 and 1962, when sizeable surpluses of Rs. 241 million and Rs. 148 million respectively were recorded. The percentage ratio of exports to imports declined to 95 from 116 during the previous year.",

As pointed out in the footnote on page 38 of the Annual Report for 1963, there could be considerable difference between the value of imports actually received and cleared from the Customs in any time period and their value as reflected in the Customs entries, from which Customs statistics are derived, if there was a significant interval between the clearance of goods and the passing of the relative Customs entries. This consideration has particular relevance to Government imports, and more specifically to imports of rice, flour and sugar, which account for a considerable proportion of aggregate imports. The following are comparative figures of the total value of imports of rice, flour and sugar during 1963 and 1964, based on Customs data and on imports actually received by the Food Commissioner during this period:-",

There were significant differences in the movements of prices of the individual grades, however. While the average price of high growns at Rs. 1\u00ab93 per pound rose by 3 cents per pound and that of medium growns at Rs. 1-58 per pound by 4 cents per pound, the average price of low growns declined by 4 cents per pound to Rs. 1-49 per pound. With the ex\u00adception of the second quarter, the average prices of high growns showed increa\u00adses in every quarter of the year as compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the increase amounting to 8 cents per pound during the last quarter. Medium growns declined in price during the first half of the year, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year, but recovered rather sharply during the second half, average prices during the last quarter of the year rising by as much as 22 cents per pound.",

    "text": "While there has been little variation in these prices during the first half of the year, prices during the 3rd and 4th quarters have fallen sharply by 6 cents per pound and 10 cents per pound respectively, as compared with the correspon\u00adding quarters of the previous year. The principal factors in this decline were developments which followed the nationalization, on August 8, 1964, of the tea import trade in Iraq, who was by far the largest single buyer of our teas in the Middle East accounting for well over one half of our total exports to that region. With effect from that date, the Purchasing Board of the Government of Iraq assumed sole responsibility for the importation of tea into that country. Purchases on account of Iraq at the Colombo Auctions virtually ceased almost immediately thereafter, only to be resumed in a modest way in the early part of December 1964, by which time the Iraqi Government Purchasing Board was in a position to introduce the new organizational arrangements that were to replace the established arrangements of the private trade. The suddenness with which these events overtook the local trade caused a severe dislocation in the flow of tea into Iraq during the last quarter of the year. At the time of nationalization of imports of tea in early August, local shippers reportedly held in their stores a quantity of approximately 5-| to 6 million pounds of tea, purchased against outstan\u00adding contracts concluded with Iraqi buyers and awaiting immediate shipment to that country. This tea, however, could not be shipped pending the resolution of questions relating to the validity of these contracts. These, and indeed the whole future of our trade in tea with Iraq, were matters which received the attention of the Government as well as the private trade during the closing months of the year. Exports of tea to Iraq, which had averaged a monthly rate of 4-7 million pounds during the first nine months of the year, dwindled to 0-7 million pounds in October and virtually ceased altogether in the following month. The repercussions of these developments on the prices of low grown teas at the Colombo Auctions were no less severe, and prices of teas specifically suited for the Iraqi market (such as, for example, the leafy B.O.P. teas) fell far more precipitously during the final quarter of the year than was suggested by the average prices of all grades of low grown tea cited above. With the re-entry of Iraq into the Colombo Auctions at the sale of December 7th, purchases were made on a modest scale and prices began to show signs of gradual recovery. However, the end of the year saw no tangible evidence of a resumption of the normal flow of exports to that country.",

During 1964 there was a recovery in production, and the aggregate volume of exports of these products at 1,618 million nuts showed a sharp expansion of 34 per cent over the previous year. While the volume of coconut oil exports expanded by 45 per cent, that of copra and desiccated coconut expanded less rapidly by 35 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.",

    "text": "During 1963 the average f.o.b. prices of coconut oil and copra had risen by 11 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. These prices rose further in 1964, though Jess rapidly, the former rising by 7 per cent and the latter by 4 per cent. In the case of desiccated coconut, however, the average f.o.b. price, which had risen by 8 per cent during 1963, showed a decline of 4 per cent. These changes reflected in broad terms the trends that prevailed in the Colombo market for these products. The prices of coconut oil in this market improved steadily throughout the year, average prices during each quarter being distinctly higher than those that obtained during the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The average price for the year amounted to Rs. 1, 087-69 per ton, an increase of Rs. 58-95 per ton or 6 per cent over the previous year. The prices of copra, however, while moving in general sympathy with those of coconut oil, showed a less steady tendency. While during the first half of the year these prices were appreciably lower than those obtaining during the same period of 1963, during the second half they were distinctly higher than in the second half of the latter year. The average price for the year at Rs. 167-78 per candy showed little variation from the level of the previous year. The average price of desiccated coconut at 40 cents per pound",

The share of consumer goods in total imports has risen sharply to 64 per cent from an average of 55 per cent during the preceding three years. Imports of 'intermediate goods' have increased moderately by Rs. 25 million, or 7 per cent, but their share of total imports at 20 per cent represents a fall of 5 percentage points over the previous year. Imports of 'investment goods', on the other hand, have fallen by Rs. 19 million or 6 per cent, while their share of total imports at 15 per cent is the lowest in recent years and considerably lower than that of the previous year, viz., 22 per cent.",

In other words, had the Customs data been in complete accord with the Food Commissioner's data, the total value of imports of rice, flour and sugar during 1964 would have been Rs. 557 million instead of Rs. 648 million, and would have risen by only 21 per cent over the previous year and not by 101 per cent as is suggested by the present Customs data. Accordingly, the impact of these imports on aggregate imports for the year would have been much lessthan is indicated by the Customs data. Furthermore, the lack of accord between these two sources of data affects quantum and price data as well. Thus while imports of rice, flour and sugar received by the Food Commissioner during 1964 have risen in volume over 1963 by 7 per cent, 9 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, the Customs data suggest that these have increased by 63 per cent, 125 per cent and 59 per cent respectively. The calculation of average unit prices for the year is also similarly affec\u00adted, and is particularly so in regard to sugar. Thus while the Food Commissioner's imports show that his average c &. f prices of rice and flour have risen by 6 per cent and 7 per cent respectively during 1964, the shipments recorded in the Customs data point to smaller increases of 4 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. On the other hand, while the average c &. f price paid by the Food Commi\u00adssioner for sugar has risen by 33 per cent, the Customs data suggest an increase of 66 per cent.",

Exports to that country expanded by Rs. 68-1 million (207 per cent) during the year, a factor which accounted in Very large measure for the sharp expansion in total exports to the region. The expansion in exports to the U S S R was in the main due to a very sharp increase in exports of rubber, which amounted to Rs. 49-1. million (as compared with exports of Rs. 0-5 million in 1963) and constituted the principal export for the year. I Exports of tea at Rs. 33-2 million increased by Rs. 14-1 million (74 per cent), while those of coconut oil at Rs. 17-1 million increased by Rs; 6-1 million (55 per cent). Exports to Poland, which amounted to Rs. 31-3 million or 20 per cent of total exports to the region, increased by Rs. 9-8 million (46, per cent). As in the previous years rubber was the principal export, accounting for Rs. 25-7 million and increasing by Rs. 6.5 million (34 percent) over the previous year. Exports to the German Democratic Republic increased sharply by Rs. 10-2 million (537 per cent) to Rs. ,121 million or 8 per cent of total exports to the region. Exports of coconut oil amounted to Rs. 8-6 million, an increase of. Rs. 7-4 million over the previous year. Exports to Rumania, which had amounted to Rs. 23-3 million in 1963, declined very sharply to Rs. 1-7 million.",

These restrictions were further intensified during the course of 1964 and by December 15th of the year, when imports of drugs were brought under individual import licence, the system of open general licenses ceased to operate altogether. This meant that, with the exception of a few residual items of negligible importance, the incidence of individual import licensing restrictions extended to the entire range of private sector imports. Details of the more important restrictive measures introduced during the year, and also a quantitative estimation of their incidence, are given in Table II (B) 10.",

It provided for revised schedules of the goods to be exchanged between the two coun\u00adtries, the schedule of Ceylon's exports including some of her new industrial products. The arrangement also provided for the appointment, when necessary, of a Mixed Committee of representatives of both countries to con\u00adsider problems arising from the implementation of the arrangement. Supplemen\u00adting the principal letters exchanged were further letters dealing specifically with the promotion of trade during 1965.",
