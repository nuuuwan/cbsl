The balance on merchandise account deteriorated by Rs. 32-0 million to Rs. 193-0. million but because of an improve\u00adment in the invisible balance from a deficit of Rs. 6-6 million to a surplus of Rs. 45-3 million, the total current account deficit was reduced from Rs 167-6 million in 1963 to Rs. \u2022 1476 million in 1964. The \"basic balance\" which is derived by setting off the current account balance against net long-term capital receipts, however, showed no significant improvement in 1964 due to the decline in net long-term capital receipts from Rs. 80-0 million in .1963 to Rs. 66-0 million in 1964. The net official long-term capital receipts in 1964 amo\u00adunted to Rs. 67-4 million as compared with a receipt of Rs. 75-4 million in 1963. Ceylon's \"basic balance\" in the balance of payments account showed a deficit of approximately Rs. 82-0 million in 1964 as compared with the deficit of Rs. 88-0 million in 1963. This 'basic deficit' was financed by incurring",

The rise in import prices was mainly concentrated on 'food and drink' and, 'other consumer goods' categories. The vakie of exports increased by Rs. 56-0 million to Rs. 1,764-0 milllion fundamentally as a result of an increase of 7-2 per cent in the volume of exports, the average price of all exports remaining unchanged at the level of the previous year. The value of aggregate exports in 1964 would probably have increased even much more if the volume of tea exports which account for about two-thirds of Ceylon's total foreign exchange earnings had not remained static chiefly due to a shortfall in production particularly in the first three quarters and due to the cyclone which struck the North and East coast of Ceylon at the close of the year resulting in a loss of several cargoes of tea. Further, an increase of 21 per cent in the volume of rubber exports was moderated by a fall of 7 per cent in average price. An increase of 33 per cent in the volume of coconut product exports was assisted by a 3 per cent increase in average price.",

The increase in private sector and Government corporation imports reflected increases in textile imports, in imports of fish and fish preparations and curry stuffs and also in fertilizers.

However, there were partly compensating declines in the average prices of textiles (3%), intermediate goods (5%) and investment goods (2%). But in view of the stringent import controls which have resulted in substantial declines in the total outlays on consumer goods imports in recent years, the net contribution to the balance of payments as a result of price declines in these items would not be very significant. Import prices in respect of consumer goods other than food and drink and textiles also increased by 2-4 per cent in 1964. This was a further contributory factor to the rise in Ceylon's import bill and balance of payments difficulties in 1964. Ceylon's experience in 1964 indicates that the terms of trade still continue to play a dominant role in determining the level of the trade balance and is capable of nullifying the increased efforts made by the country to balance its payments position through measures directed towards an increase in exports and a reduction in imports by increased product\u00adion and quantitative restrictions, respectively.",

The improvement in the balance on invisibles account in 1964 mainly derived from a reduction of Rs. 18-4 million to Rs. 34-1 million in the net deficit on investment income and an increase in the surplus on transfer payments. The investment income account benefited from the moratorium on the transfer of dividends, profits and capital instituted in August 1964, moderated partly by a fall in the income earned on Ceylon's declining external assets. Grants from foreign governments also increased by Rs. 32-8 million to Rs. 76-4 million in 1964 mainly reflecting assistance from China (Rs. 32-8",

In contrast the external reserves registered an increase of Rs. 14-5 million in the second half, of. the year reflecting the improvement in the balance of payments position during this period. Of the total external assets of Rs. 304-7 million (net of Sterling Loan Sinking Funds) at the end of 1964, the balance of the International Reserve of the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 135-9 million. The liquid funds of the International Reserve as at the end of the year amounted to Rs. 49-7 million, while the balance consisted mainly of holdings of foreign securities.
