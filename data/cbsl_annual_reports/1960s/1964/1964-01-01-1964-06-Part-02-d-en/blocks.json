At the end of 1963, the number of registrants at employment exchanges was 0.2 per cent lower than at the end of the previous year. These numbers increased steadily during the third and fourth quarters of 1964, so that at the end of December 1964, the number of regis\u00adtrants totalled 165, 456 compared with 151, 922 at the end of December 1963. During the course of the year there was an increase in registration by persons seeking technical and clerical employment, so that at the end of the year these registrants numbered 14.7 per cent more than at the end of December 1963. The number of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled registrants increased by 8.2 per cent, 5.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent respectively, than at the end of December 1963. Complete data relating to employment created in 1964 in the Government sector, semi-Government Corporations and the private sector are not available.",
