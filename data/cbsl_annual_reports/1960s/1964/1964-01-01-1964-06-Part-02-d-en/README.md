(D) EMPLOYMENT AND L A B O U R RELATIONS

Employment

In the absence of annual aggregate data the only rough indicator of the annual movement in the level of unemployment is the data relating to the num­ber of registrants at employment exchanges. At the end of 1963, the number of registrants at employment exchanges was 0.2 per cent lower than at the end of the previous year. These numbers increased steadily during the third and fourth quarters of 1964, so that at the end of December 1964, the number of regis­trants totalled 165, 456 compared with 151, 922 at the end of December 1963. During the course of the year there was an increase in registration by persons seeking technical and clerical employment, so that at the end of the year these registrants numbered 14.7 per cent more than at the end of December 1963. The number of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled registrants increased by 8.2 per cent, 5.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent respectively, than at the end of December 1963. Complete data relating to employment created in 1964 in the Government sector, semi-Government Corporations and the private sector are not available.

The following table shows the number of persons who have been placed in employment in recent years together with the percentage which such place­ments bear to total registrants on the books, in each category.

The number of persons placed in employment during 1964 has been some­what higher than in recent years. The largest number of persons placed has been in the unskilled category. The percentage of persons placed to total regis­trants has also been highest in this category, namely b 5.3 per cent. The percentage of placings to total registrants among technical and clerical registrants was a close second. These percentages were generally equal to or higher than those for the previous year among all categories of workers.

Labour Relations

( 75 )

The data on strikes serve as a partial barometer of the changes in the

climate of employer-employee relations. The Table below shows the number of

strikes, the number of workers involved and the number of man-days lost as a

result of strikes.

In 1964 the number of strikes on plantations was slightly higher than in 1963, while the number of strikes in other employments was considerably higher. The plantation sector, where the major part of the organised working population is employed, continued to record the largest number of strikes. In 1964 the number of strikes on plantations and other employments totalled 178 and 82 compared with 174 and 58 respectively in 1963. Though the number of workers involved was smaller in the plantation sector, the number of man-days lost was larger than in the previous year. In other employments the number of workers involved and number of man-days lost were smaller.

Strikes in the plantation sector lasted on an average 9.0 days in 1964, com­pared with an average of 5.8 days in 1963. Strikes in other employments are generally more protracted than on plantations. However, the duration of these strikes was reduced from an average of 16.1 days in 1963 to 12.6 days in 1964.

Regarding the reasons underlying strikes, according to the classification made by the Department of Labour, dismissal or loss of employment accounted for 29.6 per cent, estate rules, discipline, working arrangements etc. for 26.9 per cent and wage disputes, such as non-payment and delay in payment of wages, for 11.9 per cent of strikes and these took place mainly on plantations. General demands accounted for 9.6 per cent of the strikes. Strikes arising from demands for wage increases were relatively small, accounting for only 2.3 per cent of all Strikes and took place mainly in the non-plantation sector,
