    "text": "The larger use of currency may be attributed to such factors as changes in income distribution in favour of sections of the population who do not have recourse to banking facilities, to motives of tax evasion, and to the tax on certain categories of debits to bank accounts. The considerable increase in currency notes of larger denominations which occurred since 1960 lends support to this view. As revealed by Table II ( E ) 5 above, currency notes of Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 denominations together increased by Rs. 248 million between December 1960 and May 1964, while the ratio of these notes to total currency issue rose markedly from 46 per cent to 58 per cent. However, from June 1964 onwards, the currency composition underwent a considerable change. Notes of Rs. 100 denomination declined sharply by Rs. 130 million between end of May and December 1964, while notes of Rs. 50 and Rs. 10 denominations increased by Rs. 12 million and Rs. 102 million respectively. These changes might have been a reflection of expectations regarding measures directed against tax evasion and the hoarding of undeclared assets in the form of currency notes of the higher denominations. It may be noted however that the fear of these expected measures did not induce dishoarding of currency to any appreciable extent.. It merely resulted in a change in the currency composition in favour of notes of smaller denominations as a medium of currency hoarding.",

    "text": "The principal influences underlying changes in the money supply in 1964 were broadly the same as in 1963. Domestic transactions of the Government with the banking system and operations of the private sector with the commer\u00adcial banks were expansionary, while the external deficit, as reflected in the net external banking assets position, tended to contract the money supply. However, domestic money creation associated with Government deficits though continuing to be high was markedly smaller during the current year than in the previous year - Rs. 101-7 million compared with Rs. 158-6 million. In fact, the main development which contained the monetary expansion during the year, to a volume substantially less than the increase in 1963 was the relatively smaller Government deficit. It is also observed that aggregate commercial bank lending to the private sector including Government Corporations emerged as the major expansionary influence on the money supply in 1964-However, the increase of Rs. 111-7 million in gross bank credit1 during the current year fell short of the increase of Rs. 124-2 million in 1963. Thus factors tending to increase the money supply were quantitatively smaller in 1964 than in 1963; but the contraction of domestic circulation of money, resulting from external deficits and the increase in non-Governmental savings, also occurred on a smaller scale. The decline in net external banking assets was only Rs. 36-4 million in 1964 compared with Rs. 53-2 million in 1963. Non-Governmental time and savings deposits held with the banking system rose by Rs. 52-5 million as against Rs. 63-4 million in 1963. These factors, in sum, resulted in a net increase of Rs. 115-8 million in the money supply in 1964-",

The increase in total liabilities was largely the outcome of a substantial expansion of Rs. 146-2 million in deposit liabilities which was partially counteracted by a reduction of Rs. 18.8 million and Rs. 5 million in commercial bank indebtedness to the Central Bank and the Central Government respectively. The increase in aggregate deposits was reflected in the ratio of deposits to total liabilities which rose from 85-1 per cent to 87-3 per cent in 1964.",

    "text": "Deposits accruing to commercial banks from all sources rose by Rs. 146.2 million or 11.2 per cent to Rs. 1447.5 million in 1964. The change in deposits during the year assumed a pattern different from that of the previous year. In 1963 the increase of Rs. 72-8 million in time and savings deposits exceeded the increase of Rs. 46 million in demand deposits. In contrast, in 1964 demand deposits rose by Rs. 94-3 million from Rs. 802-1 million to Rs. 896-4 million, while time and savings deposits increased by Rs. 51-9 million to Rs. 551-1 million. The rapid increase in demand deposits temporarily arrested the change in the maturity distribution of commercial bank deposits towards longer-term deposits. Expre\u00adssed as a ratio of aggregate deposits, demand deposits rose fractionally from 61-6 per cent in 1963 to 61-9 per cent in 1964. Further, the large deposit accrual to commercial banks came almost entirely from non-Governmental sources. Government deposits with commercial banks increased slightly by Rs. 2-9 million, but the ratio of government deposits to aggregate commercial bank deposits declined from 12-1 per cent to 11-1 per cent in 1964.",
