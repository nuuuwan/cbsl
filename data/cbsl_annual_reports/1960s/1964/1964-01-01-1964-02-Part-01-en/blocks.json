In 1963, Gross National Product in real terms increased by only 1.9 per cent whilst real product per capita actually declined by 0.6 per cent. In 1964, on the other hand, Gross National Product in real terms is es\u00adtimated to have risen by 4.5 per cent and real product per capita by 2.1 per cent. There were significant increases in the net output of the export crops, coconut and rubber, as well as increases in the net output of the domestic sector including paddy production and industrial output. The high percentage growth rate of 1964 was in part, however, a reflection of the relatively poor performance of the economy in 1963.",

The terms of trade which declined sharply by 9 per cent in 1963 dropped further by 3 per cent In 1964. Despite drastic restrictions on imports, Ceylon experienced a deficit in her balance of payments on current account resulting in a decline oi Rs. 51.0 million in external assets and a rise of Rs. 40.0 million in short-term external liabilities. The rise in world prices of food imports, particularly sugar, contributed significantly to Ceylon's payments difficulties in 1964.",

Successive reports of the Central Bank have drawn attention to the fiscal and monetary expansion that has been taking place in recent years. This expansion had its repercussions successively on the country's external reserves and its domestic price level-reper\u00adcussions which were intensified by persistent unfavourable movements in Ceylon's terms of trade. Nevertheless, Ceylon's present difficulties are not of a kind that can be overcome by a slowing down of the monetary-fiscal expansion alone. The depletion of external reserves has helped bring to the surface problems of a more basic character-problems relating to the adequacy of supplies, particularly of imported goods needed for realising the objective of rapid economic growth. A slowing down in the tempo of monetary-fiscal expansion is a necessary condition for relieving pressures on the domestic price level and for reducing disequilibrium in the monetary field. But this would need to be combined with other approaches, both of a short-term and long-term character - designed to strengthen Ceylon's external payments position, if the physical resources needed for an adequate rate of economic growth in Ceylon are tp be obtained.",

But she was able to do this at the expense of a further decline in her external reserves and an increase in her short-term external liabilities. More\u00adover, even the augmented flow of imports barely sufficed to provide Ceylon wittvher minimum import requirements. Shortages and scarcities appeared in several fields and, although production in the nascent industrial sector continued to register sizeable increases, there was growing evidence, parti\u00adcularly towards the latter part of 1964, of inadequacies in respect of industrial raw materials and equipment and of the under utilisation of capacity by many industrial enterprises. Indeed, in 1964, there were clear signs that Ceylon's ability to sustain the tempo of new industrial growth was already threatened by a paucity of foreign exchange, a paucity which could only impede the licensing and initiation of new ventures. The shortage of foreign exchange, moreover, manifested itself despite a stringent curtailment of inessential consumer imports.",

    "text": "expand export production alone. It is also the result of movements in export and import prices, i. e. the terms of trade. In fact, it is the case that the failure of Ceylon's import capacity to rise adequately is partly the outcome of unfavour\u00adable movements in external prices-of both exports and imports-which have in large part frustrated her efforts to augment her export earnings through increases in the output of export products. Over the ten years 1954 to 1963 Ceylon succeeded in steadily increasing the volume of her major export product, tea, at an average annual rate of 3-1 per cent. 1964 was one of the exceptional years in which the volume of tea exports did not rise. Ceylon has also been attempting to increase the productive capacity of her rubber and coconut industries through extensive programmes of replanting and rehabilitation. Nevertheless, the pur\u00adchasing power of Ceylon's exports has been rising at a much slower rate than the increases in volumes. Thus, between 1948 and 1964 Ceylon's total exports increased in volume at an average annual rate of 2-7 per cent, but the purchasing power of these exports, i. e. import capacity increased at a rate of only 1-6 per cent per year on average. The growth, in export volumes was itself less than the rate of population growth; but the growth in import capacity was substantially less. This means in effect that import capacity per capita was steadily declining over this period-a phenomenon which, if not offset by the use of external reserves or by external capital inflows would spell a decline in the volume of import supplies per person. The table below illustrates the post war trends in export volume and import capacity in Ceylon.",

Effective development, and the process of industrialisation in particular, is dependent on the availability of a rising flow of raw materials, machin\u00adery and equipment, and even consumer goods to meet the rise in money incomes. Even the largest developing countries seldom possess the range and variety of natural resources, or the initial manufacturing capacity, to supply these requirements with\u00adin their own boundaries. The smaller countries are obviously less well endowed. In the initial stages of development at least, and for the smaller countries possibly at all stages, there is an inescapable need to obtain a varying range of requirements from abroad. If the external receipts of a country-its import capacity-does not rise adequately to make possible the purchase of these import requirements, the pace of overall economic growth would inevitably suffer. An increase in domestic savings adequate to finance a larger volume of physical investment need not by itself ensure that the type of investment appropriate to rapid growth would take place if the import requirements that are technologically necessary for the process are unobtainable.",

Further, if subsistence output is also excluded from gross national product so as to derive the total of marketable supplies, imports represent as much as 53 per cent of this latter total. It is, of course, not necessarily true that all imports are essential for maintaining or increasing productive activity or for meeting essential consumer needs. But with the low level of external reserves, Ceylon has been compelled over the last two years or so to impose drastic restrictions, amounting in many cases to total prohibitions, on categories of imported goods deemed inessential OT less essential. In fact, the scope of restrictions had to be extended to raw material and capital goods imports as well, and there is certainly little room left for further curtail\u00adment of imports without affecting production and development activities adversely. On the contrary, it is a necessary condition for future economic growth that Ceylon needs a rising flow of imports of raw materials and capital goods, and any limitations of her capacity to secure these supplies will jeopardise her development effort. For Ceylon, by reason of the very openness of her economy, the \"external bottleneck\" to development could prove indeed to be particularly real.",

In fact, whatever results might be achieved through the other approaches, it is essentially in this sphere that the more fundamental and long-term solution to the problem of import capacity may be found. There are, however, several difficulties in the way of Ceylon being able to increase its export earnings at a rate adequate to purchase the import requirements that are necessary for accelerated growth. As shown already, despite increases in export volumes, the growth rate of the purchasing power of exports has averaged only 1.6 per cent annually over the last decade and a half. If Ceylon is to secure her rising import needs solely by means of an increase in the buying power of her exports, the latter would need to grow at a considerably faster rate than in the past. It is likely for Ceylon, as for most other developing countries, that a given target in respect of the growth rate of gross national product, e. g. 6 per cent per year, is likely to require an even faster annual rate of growth of imports.1 This implies, if export earnings are to be the exclusive source of finance for imports, that the purchasing power of exports would need to increase at a faster rate than gross national product. Nevertheless, the prospects for securing such a pace of expansion in primary product exports are, on the basis of present world trends, poor indeed.",

The demand for primary products in the markets of the industrial countries has risen only slowly in recent years and there is little to suggest that these adverse trends would be reversed in the future in the absence of concerted international efforts, through commodity arrangements or other means, to strengthen primary product prices. In present conditions it is possible that there would be sporadic or cyclical increases in commodity prices-as occurred in 1963 and 1964 in the case of some primary products but which did not benefit Ceylon's exports-but these increases are of a short-term or ephemeral character which do not signify any reversal of the downward long-term trends. Attempts by primary producing countries to sustain or increase their export earnings by greater production might only intensify the decline in prices. As already mentioned, Ceylon's efforts to increase output over the last decade and a half have not resulted In comparable gains to export earnings. In addition, the purchasing power of these export earnings is further reduced by the rising trend in the prices of industrial imports. It is a fact that during the fifties, particularly in the latter half of the fifties, the trend in the terms of trade between primary products and manufactures has favoured the latter with corresponding benefits to the industrialised countries.",

In the case of rubber, for example, replanting with high yielding strains for the purpose of reducing production costs will result in an increase in output. But such an increase in output is essentially a condition for survival in the face of declining world prices rather than a means of promoting sizeable increases in total export earnings. In other words, the benefits of raising productivity will essentially be enjoyed by consumers abroad in the form of lower prices. In the case of tea there is the possibility, in the absence of an international agreement, of world production increasing at a faster rate than world consumption with deleterious consequences on prices.

The increase in production during the last decade has been attributed largely to the increased application of fertilizers. It is uncertain as to whether or not the limits to further increases in output through this means have been broadly reached. Nevertheless, the process of replanting with high yield-ng strains, at which a begining has already been made, is certainly capable of bringing about a substantial rise in output. Whether Ceylon's export earnings could benefit equally from this effort may well depend, however, on parallel action at the international level to strengthen and stabilise world trade in the commodity. The consequence for economic development that would result from a continuance of the adverse trends of the past decade in respect of world trade in primary products, and the urgent need for remedial action on an international scale, was one of the major themes of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held in Geneva in 1964. The problems of Ceylon's specific export products, tea, rubber and coconut amply illustrate this theme and under\u00adline the case for international approaches in the commodity field or for schemes of international compensatory financing to asssist developing countries which suffer from long-term declines in their terms of trade.",

In the long run Ceylon could also add to her export ear\u00adnings through the sale abroad of industrial products. Indeed, the establishment of export capacity in the industrial sector is, in view of domestic market limitations, a necessary condition for both large scale industrialisation in Ceylon and for a long-term solution of her external payments problem. Ceylon has in the very recent period, under the stimulus of import restrictions, established several new industrial activities producing for the domestic market. But a period of time must naturally elapse before Ceylon could build up an industrial export capacity on a scale that would sufficiently augment her export earnings from primary products so as to enable her to purchase in return the full magnitude of her import needs. Industrial exports on a large scale might also be dependent on arrangements for regional co-operation in Asia which would help to improve access to regional markets. Moreover, the successful establishment of large scale industrial capacity in Ceylon would itself involve increased imports of machinery, equipment and raw materials and require, therefore, an interim solution to her external payments problem. However, though the goal of large scale industrial exports is a relatively long-term one, there is a need for an immediate beginning to foster such exports wherever possible. It is important, for instance, that in the establishment of new industries, even if they are initially based on the domestic market, attention should be paid to the possibility of a subsequent orientation towards exports.",

    "text": "that would also contribute towards such a solution. The second of these approaches is that of import substitution. Ceylon could economise on her external resources not only by curtailing imports of luxuries and inessentials, as indeed she has already done, but also by replacing imports by domestically produced substi\u00adtutes. As mentioned, restrictions on imports have already resulted in the establishment of several domestic industries. It needs to be well recognised, that there are severe limits in a country like Ceylon to foreign exchange saving through a process of import substitution in the sphere of manufacturing industry. In the first place, the creation of industrial capacity requires the impor\u00adtation not only of machinery and equipment but also of raw materials and other intermediate products. Whilst industries using domestic raw materials need to be given a high priority, it is difficult, particularly in a small country where the extent and range of domestic raw material resources are understandably limited, to sustain large scale industrial development on such a basis. It should not therefore, be surprising if domestic manufacturing production tends to have a high import content and if, specially in the early stages, the net foreign exchange saving through import substitution tend to be small. Whilst it would be correct to admit the foreign exchange saving potential amongst the criteria that should be adopted in determining industrial priorities it would be inappropriate to carry this test to the point of thwarting industrial development altogether. Moreover, an industry with a very low foreign exchange saving potential when initially producing for the domestic market may, at later stages, be capable of earning foreign exchange through exports. In fact, where the principle of import substi\u00adtution becomes the sole basis for industrialisation, there is the possibility that an uneconomic or high cost structure of industries would come to be established.",

    "text": "Whilst import substitution in the field of industrial manufactures is unlikely to assist substantially in relieving Ceylon's external payments problem, the position is different in the case of import substitution in the field of agriculture. Although Ceylon is predominantly an exporter of primary products, a large proportion of her imports are also made up of primary products. The evolution of the Ceylon economy has resulted in a pattern of specialisation in which the country obtains a substantial volume of her food requirements from abroad. These include not only about half her needs of rice, but the major portion of her needs of fish, sugar, milk and milk products, potatoes, onions, chillies and similar items. It is in these fields that import substitution is likely to result in appreciable savings of foreign exchange. The total value of food imports into Ceylon amounted to Rs. 1010-8 million in 1964 and accounts for nearly 51.2 per cent of the total import bill. The value of rice imports amounted to Rs. 3263 million, sugar imports to Rs. 185*0 million, fish imports to Rs. 685 million, and milk and milk products imports to Rs. 934 million, etc. It is evident that a concerted attempt at import substitution in these fields can yield large gains and would offer a promising means whereby Ceylon's external payments position could be strengthened. It should be noted that an accelerated attempt on the agricultural front with the objective of import substitution is intimately connected with the goal of industriali\u00adsation as well. Import substitution in agriculture will release exchange resources that would otherwise be utilised in importing agricultural products and enable",

The non-plantation agricultural sector is characterised by traditional forms of organisation and production whose transformation into modern high productivity systems requires a sustained effort. It is a common misconception to assume that an \"agricultural country\" would necessarily find it easier to make more rapid strides in agriculture than in industry.

The existence of a gap between minimum import needs and likely export earnings is common to the developing countries as a whole at the present time. Since the world demand for primary products is unlikely to rise at an adequate rate and there are limits to the practicable extent of import substitution, there will inevitably be a need for larger capital inflows to bridge the payments gap that would arise in these countries in the process of accelerated development. In recent years there has been a notable acceleration in the quantum of capital flows to the developing countries from the industrial countries of the West and from the socialist countries. These flows have increasingly taken the form of official capital movements i.e. loans etc., through bilateral and multilateral agencies, rather than of direct investments of private capital.

    "text": "true, of course that imports represent a higher percentage of national income in Ceylon than in many other developing countries. But capital flows into Ceylon, even when measured against national income or total investment, compare unfavourably with similar measurements in a number of developing coun\u00adtries. In addition, the very fact that Ceylon is crucially dependent on imports makes it doubly important that capital flows should suffice to bridge any gap between minimum import needs and export earnings. In fact, what Ceylon has gained by way of capital receipts in recent years has been more than offset by the losses she has sustained through a decline in the terms of trade. This is illustrated in the table above which compares capital inflows into Ceylon with gains or losses through changes in the terms of trade as measured at 1958 prices.",

This would enable Ceylon to accelerate programmes in the field of agricultural and industrial development and to strengthen eventually her external position as well as reduce her dependence on external assistance. Ceylon's need is not merely for \"project aid\". In the immeditate context there is an overriding need to sustain an adequate flow of raw materials and capital equipment in order to maintain and increase the tempo of general economic activity. It is a fact that Ceylon's foreign exchange difficulties and the consequent need to impose stringent import restrictions have resulted in shortages of raw materials and spares which prevent the full utilisation of existing capacity, particularly in the emergent industrial sector. Whilst project aid will assist Ceylon in implementing her medium and long-term development plans, there is also a need for additional external resour\u00adces to support and strengthen the country's external payments position. In this connection it is perhaps relevant to note that a recent credit to India from the International Development Association providing foreign exchange for the purchase of materials and spares is a welcome development in the field of aid concepts.",

But in a situation of acute foreign exchange shortages even Ceylon would be increasingly forced to resort to such expedients as suppliers' credits and similar types of external borrowing which impose unduly severe service burdens.

The domestic price level was not substantially affected during this period and, apart from the decline in external reserves, there was little direct evidence of the adverse repercussions of the monetary expansion. With the rapid depletion in external reserves the impact of the monetary expansion entered its second phase. Direct restrictions on imports had to be imposed in order to stem the fall in reserves and this resulted in a reduction in the volume of imported goods. The restrictions on imports were most severe, in the first instance on the less essential categories of consumer goods. But with the continued pressures on the country's reserves, the scope of the import licensing system had to be progressively extended until eventually the whole range of import outlays had to be determined in terms of a budget of foreign exchange allocations. Whilst every attempt was made to sustain an adequate flow of essential imports-Government food imports, for instance, were maintained at levels necessary to meet consumer needs despite rises in external prices-it was inevitable that with the continuance of pressures on the balance of payments the impact of the restrictions would be felt over an increasing range of items including raw materials and capital goods.",

    "text": "The sharp restriction of imports in the background of a continuing monetary expansion resulted in growing pressures on the domestic price level. For a time these pressures were cushioned by the availability of previously imported stocks, but with the depletion of these stocks the increases in prices tended to become more marked. In the absence of a composite measure of price changes, such as an index of wholesale or retail prices, it is not possible to assess the actual extent of the rise in the general price level. The only available index of price changes - the Colombo Consumers' Price Index-has registered a distinct upward trend over the last two to three .years rising from 104-8 in 1961 to 106-3 in 1962, to 108-8 in 1963 and to 112-2 in 1964. The Colombo Consumers' Price Index is, however, limited in coverage being based on working class family budgets in which subsidised and price controlled items enjoy a relatively heavy weightage. Price data on important items not covered by the Consumer Price Index suggest relatively sharp price increases in several categories of goods. The momentum of price change in Ceylon has not, of course, reached the dimensions attained in some other countries where expansionary pressures have been greater in magnitude and longer in duration. But as indi\u00adcated in the previous Annual Report, an inflationary process, unless restrained in time, tends to gather strength and to sustain itself in a cumulative manner-An inflationary background, for instance, induces the speculative hoarding of supplies-a process that further aggravates scarcities and price rises. Again, rises in living costs could result in pressures for wage increases. Such wage increases, however, if unrelated to increases in productivity would tend to intensify further, the rise in prices and to prove self defeating. In the case of Ceylon, a rise in production costs, through wage increases for instance, could also result in adverse repercussions on the balance of payments. Cost increases in the export sector could not be passed on to consumers abroad and could lead to a reduction in the output of marginal producers,",

In such a situation, acute scarcities and high prices could emerge from time to time in respect of individual items in accordance with the arrival of supplies.

    "text": "Again, foreign aid receipts amounted to Rs 98.6 million estimate of Rs 175 million. Nevertheless, the major ca between the estimated expansionary deficit for 1963/64 an^ was a rise in the food subsidy bill and consequently in Total current expenditures in 1963/64 exceeded the Budget million. However, the excess in the food subsidy bill Rs 102.5 million. A sharp increase in the world price of sugar, beyoT on which the estimates were based, was the major factor responsible for this excess in the food subsidy bill. Sugar is imported and distributed by Government and the profit from its sale partially offset the losses through the sale of rice at subsidised prices. In 1963/64, the increase in the purchase price of imports in the background of unchanged domestic selling prices resulted in a decline in the profit from sugar beyond the amount anticipated. It is clear, therefore, that the rise in world prices, in excess of the price on which the estimates were based, was an important factor underlying the divergence between budgetary expectations and actual results in respect of expansionary financing'in 1963/64. There was, however, a considerable shortfall in the capitial outlays of Government relative to the original estimates-actual outlays being Rs 136.1 million below the latter.",

    "text": "It is apparent from the analysis above that had the food subsidy bill not risen sharply in 1963/64, the Government's budgetary operations would have shown a fair improvement over the preceding financial year in terms of the magni\u00adtude of the expansionary deficit. One of the notable features of 1963/64 was the very marked increase in Government revenues. Total revenues increased from Rs 1593.4 million in 1962/63 to Rs 1753.5 million in 1963/64-an increase of Rs 160.1 million. This is certainly a substantial increase for a single year. Import duty collections, which rose by Rs 83.8 million, made the major contribution to the rise in revenues. There were also substantial increases in duty collections on textiles, grain and flour, and the category \"other goods\" shown in the Government revenue classification. Receipts from income tax, inclusive of the surcharge, increased by Rs 26.0 million whilst receipts from general sales and turnover taxes rose by Rs. 15.9 million. These increases were offset only in part by declines in receipts from the export duty on rubber, import duties on kerosene oil, motor spirits, liquid fuel, tobacco and cigarettes, and also from such taxes as the land tax and the national development tax which had been earlier withdrawn.",

If Treasury expectations in respect of revenues and current expenditures are realised, the overall deficit in the budget would decline below the amount anticipated.

The first is that Ceylon has been making resolute efforts to mobilize additional resources for the finance of Government expendit\u00adures, both current and capital, through taxation and borrowings from non-bank sources. There have been particularly striking increases in revenue. In 1964 total Government revenue amounted to 24.6 per cent of Gross National Product, a proportion that is seldom attained in a developing country. Ceylon's tax effort has been particularly strenuous and has involved relatively heavy tax rates in several fields. But this has been made necessary by the need to restrain the magnitude of expansionary financing in the' context of rising requirements for Government expenditure.",

The Annual Report for 1963 drew attention to the need to consider the question of the appropriate scale of subsidy outlays within the framework of a programme for restraining inflationary pressures and for mobilizing resources for an accelerated rate of economic growth. It pointed out that as long as external reserves were available, expansionary financing \u2014 which was made necessary in part by the food subsidies-did not involve increases in the general level of prices since import supplies were able to meet the additional demand. In the present situation, with the restrictions on the supply of imports, expansionary financing imposes pressures on the general level of prices.

In the more recent period, on the other hand, the reduction of the drain on external reserves through import and exchange restrictions has augmented the liquid resources of the banking system and increased its capacity to expand credit. In 1964 commercial bank credit to the private sector increased by Rs 111.7 million exclusive of export bills as compared with an increase of Rs 124-2 million in 1962. As already mentioned, the expansionary fiscal deficit of Government has shown a moderately declining trend over the recent period and was maintained at around Rs 160 million in each of the fiscal years 1962/63 and 1963/64- The rise in commercial bank credit to the private sector has thus served to sustain the total monetary expansion at a high level despite the scaling down of the Government's expansionary deficit.",

Commercial purposes represented largely increased lending for import trading and wholesale and retail trading. Rs 10.5 million of the increase in lending for industrial purposes accrued to the building and engineering industries. Consumption loans too have increased, though moderately. These figures of changes in bank advances as classified by purpose need, however, to be interpreted with caution. In the previous year 1963 there was a large Increase-Rs. 50.3 million-in advances under the category, other loans. In 1964, on the other hand, this category registered a decline and it is difficult to determine the extent to which the increases under other heads relative to the previous year represent a more specific classification of ad\u00advances by purpose by the commercial banks.",

    "text": "In recent years there had been a persistent tendency for the currency com\u00adponent of the money supply to increase relative to demand deposits. Thus in 1963, 71 per cent of the total increase in money supply was accounted for by an increase in currency. In 1964, however, there was a marked reversal of this trend. In that year, the currency component represented only 21 per cent of the increase in the money supply whilst demand deposits accounted for 79 per cent of the increase. As a result, the ratio of currency to money supply declined from 55 per cent in 1963 to 52.6 per cent in 1964. The slower rate of growth in currency relative to demand deposits was also accompanied by a change in the composition of currency as between notes of different denominations. In recent years there was a marked increase in the notes in circulation of the denominations of Rs. 100 and Rs. 50. Between May and September 1964, however, notes of the Rs. 100 denomination declined from a total of Rs. 298.0 million to Rs. 170.2 million. At the time, notes of the Rs. 10 denomination increased from Rs. 257.4 million to Rs. 335.8 million. These developments were presumably associated with anticipations concerning the possible demonetization of the Rs. 100 note and budgetary measures against tax evasion as might be evidenced by the hoarding of currency in notes of the higher denominations.",

The reduction in external assets in 1964 -exclusive of a repayment through sinking funds of Rs. 60 million of sterling loans-was Rs. 51.0 million. The increase in long-term external liabilities as a source of finance for the current account deficit, i. e. net long-term borrowing, was Rs. 66.0 million. However, the net increase in external liabilities after account is taken of the repayment of the sterling loan was Rs. 7 million. Rs. 54 million of the current account deficit was financed by an increase in official short-term liabilities.

With increasing pressures on imports on the one .hand, and inadequate reserves on the other, there is a need for such coun\u00adtries to have greater access to external resources, both short-term and long-term, if disruptions in economic activity are to be avoided and the pace of develop\u00adment accelerated. Ceylon is already experiencing these problems and difficulties to an increasing degree. There is a clear need to augment the flow of external resources into Ceylon in order to alleviate her payments problems. But such a flow, if realised, would need to be geared to sound programmes of development and to appropriate policies in the monetary and fiscal fields which will serve to strengthen her balance of payments position in the years ahead. An accumu\u00adlation of external liabilities of a short-term character, particularly suppliers' credits obtained on burdensome terms, if not accompanied by adequate programmes and policies will only afford temporary relief at the expense of more severe burdens in the future. Ceylon's present external liabilities are relatively low compared to many other developing countries. But Ceylon has to be cautious lest her payments difficulties lead her to have recourse to external credits of an inappropriate type.",

It has pointed to some of the longer term and more basic trends underlying Ceylon's external payments position. It has also pointed to the imbalance in the domestic field brought about by the fiscal and monetary expansion of recent years. Ceylon needs at present to pursue three major objectives. It has to reduce the monetary disequilibrium between demand and supply; it needs, within this objective, to mobilize increased domestic resources for development by increasing savings and restraining increases in consumption; and it needs to augment the flow of external resources to help bridge the gap between minimum import requirements and export earnings. These objectives are interdependent. An enhanced flow of external resources will assist in the task of reducing the monetary disequilibrium by increasing the volume of available supplies. A reduction in monetary disequilibrium will itself serve to enlarge the flow of external resources by providing a background of greater financial stability. An increased domestic effort in the field of production will both relieve the",
