Table 18 of Appendix II shows-the original estimates and the actual (provisional) revenue collections for 1963/64 by the main Heads of revenue as appearing in the Govern\u00adment Estimates. This table reveals that total Government revenue for 1963/64 at Rs 1,753-5 million has exceeded the actual revenue collections of 1962/63 of Rs 1,593-4 million by as much as Rs 160-1 million. The revenue outturn of 1963/64 has thus reversed the fall in revenue collections which occurred in 1962/63 over the financial year 1961/62, and re-established the trend of increasing revenue collections recorded since 1952/53. While the low level of revenue collections in 1962/63 has contributed to the increase of Rs 160-1 million in 1963/64, it is never\u00adtheless significant that the revenue collections of 1963/64 show the largest annual increase recorded since the financial year 1950/51.",

Instead Government's total expenditure is divided into four categories viz., personal emoluments, administration charges, services provided by departments and economic development and each of the last three categories is further divided into recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure. Thus Government's total expenditure is divided into seven votes. In this table the total expenditure falling under the personal emoluments and recurrent expenditure votes viz., votes 1, 2, 4 and 6 and the total of the capital expenditure votes viz., 3, 5 and 7 are shown separately as recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure respectively. Since a similar classification is not available for years prior to 1960/61, expenditure chargeable to revenue an 1 expenditure chargeable to loan funds are assumed to be comparable to recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure respectively.",

    "text": "As compared with the original estimates for 1963/64, the actual revenue collected shows a shortfall of the order of Rs 34-1 million. The diminished signifi\u00adcance of this shortfall is apparent when it is realised that the corresponding overesti-mation of revenue for the financial year 1962/63 compared with the actual revenue collected was Rs 123-5 million; in 1961/62 it was Rs 156 million and in 1960/61 Rs. 120 million. The shortfall of Rs 34-1 million in 1963/64 is mainly accounted for by reductions in collections from export duties [ item l.(b) (iv) ] to the extent of Rs. 30-4 million and general sales and turnover taxes [ item l.(b) (i) ] of Rs 29-0 million. Within the export duty category, the shortfall was in respect of rubber (Rs. 28-2 million) and tea (Rs. 8-0 million), while the delay in the implementation of the turnover taxes accounted for a decline in collections under general sales and turnover taxes. On the other hand, collections from selective sales taxes [item l.(b) (ii) ] and taxes from personal and corporate income [items. 1 (a) (i) and (ii)l recorded increases of Rs. 27-3 million and Rs. 22-7 million respectively.",

    "text": "Revenue from export duties was lower by Rs. 1-3 million as compared with the actual collections in 1962/63. This was as a result of a fall in duty collections of rubber of Rs. 17-5 million offset by an increase in the collections of the duties on tea (including the tea tax levied at the Colombo and London auctions) and duties on coconut products of Rs. 2 2 million and Rs. 14-2 million respectively. The decline in the export duty collections on rubber was the combined result of a fall both in the quantity exported (by 0-7 million lbs.) and the average f.o.b. price( 1 ) (by 8 cents per lb.). On the other hand, the increase in the export duty receipts from coconut was largely on account of an increase in export volume which was also supported by the improvement in prices. Exports of copra which amounted to 43.1 thousand tons in 1962/63 increased to 593 thousand tons in 1963/64, while desiccated coconut and coconut oil exports increased from 47*2 thousand tons and 84*3 thousand tons respectively in 1962/63 to 55-1 thousand tons and 104-5 thousand tons respectively in 1963/64. The effects of these increases in export volume were enhanced by higher effective rates of duties consequent on a favourable price effect. The average price (f. o. b.) for all three types of coconut products increased from Rs. 56-94 to Rs. 5907 per cwt. Collections under the duties on tea recorded a slight increase in spite of a fall of 4 cents per lb. in the f. o. b. price during the financial year from Rs. 2-53 per lb. in 1962/63 to Rs. 2-49 per lb. in 1963/64. This was due to an increase of 21-3 million lbs. in 1963/64 over 1962/63( 2 ) in the quantity of teas exported.",

The increased collections under cotton textiles, sugar and grain and flour were due to an increased volume of imports and a recovery of arrears of duty from the Food Commissioner in respect of the last two items. In particular, the import volume index reveals that the volume of textile imports almost doubled during the financial year under consideration. By the same token, the fall in the duty collections on kerosene oil, motor spirits etc., was due to the delay in the pay\u00adment of duty by the Petroleum Corporation, and the fall in duty collections on the import of cigarettes and tobacco to a reduction in import volume. The incre ase of duty collections under the category \"other goods\", however, is accounted for by the sharp increase in import duty rates in 1963 which supplemented other measures introduced to restrict the import of luxury and semi-luxury goods.",

Current expenditure is derived by deducting the value of sinking fund contributions and direct repayments o: public debt from revenue and expenditure of a capital nature (such as maintenance expenditure and purchase of durab'e goods) from the total of the Recurrent Expenditure Votes (1,2, 4 and 6). (2.) Capital expenditure includes expenditure on the creation, acquisition and maintenance of real assets whose useful life exceeds one year and expenditures on the acquisition of financial assets, mainly loans to the C.T.B., the Port (Cargo) Corporation and the Local Loans and Development Fund. Capital expenditure according to this definition is not synonymous with development expenditure as it includes certain capital items of a non-development nature and excludes certain current items of development expenditure. Capital expenditure is made up of the expenditure under the Capital Expenditure Votes (i.e. votes 3, 5 and 7), expenditure chargeable to foreign aid, both loans and grants, capital items in the recurrent expenditure votes and extra-budgetary outlays such as the rubber and tea replanting subsidy expenditure, Electrical Department Reserve Expenditure etc. Extra-budgetary ittms amounted to Rs. 23.3 million in 1960/61 Rs. 21.8 million in 1961/62, Rs. 23.9 million in 1962/63, Rs. 49.1 million (estimates) and Rs. 29.5 million (provisional) in 1963/64 and Rs. 23.5 million in 1964/65.",

It is significant however that the increase in the expansionary impact of the deficit, when adjusted for the change in U.S. Aid counterpart funds, in 1963/64 over the previous financial year, was considerably smaller than the increase in the net cash deficit. The expansionary impact of the budget in 1963/64 at Rs. 162-9 million has recorded an increase of only Rs. 0-9 million over the corresponding figure for 1962/63. This was achieved largely by the increased reliance on borrowing from domestic non-bank sources, which enabled the Government to reduce its borrowing from the banking system by as much as Rs. 62-9 million. This feature of Government financing, however, was offset by an increase in the drawing down of cash balances (Rs. 45-0 million), and a decrease in U.S. Aid counterpart funds.",

Foreign loan repayments during the four years amounted to Rs. 10-7 million in 1963/64, Rs. 6-3 million in 1962/63, Rs. ^-8 million in 1961/62 and Rs. 3-0 million in 1960/61. Although the net receipt from foreign loans and grants [ (see Table II (G) 9 below) ] have shown an increase and hence is indicative of a higher utilization of such foreign asistance, there nevertheless remains a difference between original expectations and actual outturn. Though a shortfall in the utilization of foreign aid makes no difference to the financing of the deficit, where the receipt of aid is tied to an equivalent amount of expenditure, from the stand point of capital formation and economic growth under-utilization of aid is a matter for concern.

The first slab of Rs. 1,000 would be taxed at 5 per cent, and the remaining income of the original first slab would ba taxed at 15 per cent. Under this proposal every tax payer,who was entitled to this concession would be granted relief of a sum of Rs. 100 irrespective of the size of his income or his family circumstances. This proposal was to be brought into effect in the current assessment year 1964/65.",

    "text": "Three important changes were proposed with regard to the wealth tax. The first relates to chatitable institutions. It was proposed to raise the exemption limit for wealth tax in respect of charitable institutions from the present level of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 100,000. This would be with retrospective effect from the year of assessment 1959/60, the year in which the wealth tax was introduced. The loss to revenue from this measure was estimated to be approximately Rs. 50,000 a year. The second change related to a revision of the present rate structure of the tax. It was proposed to exempt the first Rs. 100,000 of wealth in every case and to revise the rates of tax so as to make good the lost revenue resulting from this exemption. The highest rate of tax would be raised to 5 per cent, in the case of those whose wealth exeeded Rs. 3,000,000. The increase in revenue that would result from the stepping up of rates of tax was placed at Rs. 4.5 million. The third change related to the extension of wealth tax to shares of sterling com\u00adpanies. These shares are not property situated in Ceylon and except in the case of Ceylonese share-holders, the entire value of these shares escape wealth tax. It was proposed to remedy this situation by the imposition of a levy of 10 per cent of income in lieu of wealth tax, on the non-resident companies which own immovable property situated in Ceylon. In order to minimize the incidence of any double taxation where the wealth of an individual assessed to wealth tax consisted of any part representing the value of the shares of a non -resident com\u00adpany, suitable relief would be granted taking into account the tax in lieu of wealth tax levied on the company itself,",

The main items comprising the increase in anticipated revenue colle\u00adctions are an increase in contributions from the Ceylon Transport Board, representing payments of arrears of the heavy oil motor vehicles tax, income tax, tobacco tax and export duties from coconut products offset by decreased collections from export duties on rubber. While an increase in total revenue is anticipated, total expenditure is expected to decline below the Budgetary forecast. This is largely due to the likelihood of a substantial fall in the food subsidy bill which would more than offset increases in expenditure on account of supplementary votes including those arising out of the drought and cyclone relief and the holding of the General Elections. In terms of these reasons the anticipated fall in expenditure together with the expected increase in revenue should contribute to a significant reduction in the overall Budget deficit.",
