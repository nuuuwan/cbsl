    "text": "A substantial expansion in real output was the highlight o f the economic situation in 1967. The foundation of this expansion was firmly rooted in production fi r domestic use, unlike in past years when the gocd or bad performance o f the economy depended mainly on expert performance. Not only was the output of the domestic sector substantially higher than in the previous year, but it was also sufficient to more than offset a further decline in the export sector and to provide a higher rate of growth than in the two previous years. Thus, Gross National Product recorded an increase of 4.9 per cent, at current factor cost prices, and an increase o f 4.2 per cent at constant prices. The increase in the Gross Domestic Product at current prices was higher at 5.2 per cent, the difference being explained by \"net outflows on investment being higher than in the previous year.",

This comprised a 6.6 per cent increase in private consumption, 6.0 per cent increase in public consumption and a 16.9 per cent increase in gross domestic capital formation. The increase in gross fixed capital formation in 1967 was 12.2 per cent and was accounted for by an increase of 11.4 per cent in the private sector including public corporations and an increase o f 12.7 per cent in the govern\u00adment sector. These compare with rates o f increase in gross fixed capital formation o f 8.6 per cent, comprising increases of 12.3 per cent in the private sector and public corporations and 12.4 per cent in the Government sector, in the previous year. This satisfactory result was no doubt due to the re-orientation of the import programme in favour o f capital and intermediate gocds and the increased local production of build\u00ading materials and capital goods using imported as well as local raw materials. Es\u00adpecially noteworthy in this connection was the increase in cement production from 81,000 tons in 1966 to 189,000 tons in 1967, thereby more than doubling output.",

As a result, this particular form of resort to bank credit by Government tends to unr/e-state the total deficit and the expansionary impact in years in which this form of credit has increased and to overstate them in years in which this credit has been reduced. A further factor which affected borrowing from non-bank sources and the net expansionary impact in 1966/67 was the redemption by the Central Bank of its own se\u00adcurities of Rs. 53.4 million. These were held by savings institutions. With the redemption of these securities by the Central Bank these savings institutions increased their contri\u00adbutions to Government Securities. This has thus been recorded under borrowings from non-bank sources, whereas in reality the Central Bank provided the additional funds.

The shortfall in expenditure when compared with the estimates was due mainly to the marked fall in the net expenditure on focd subsidies which fell from an estimated expenditure of Rs. 307 million to an actual expenditure o f Rs. 193 million, as a result of the Government decision on December 18, 1966, to replace the two measures of subsidised rice given on the ration wilh one measure of free rice and the consequent changes in the pattern o f cereal consumption. The net focd subsidy bill was also lower than that o f the previous year by Rs. 81 million. Despite this the current expenditure in 1966/67 exceeded that o f 1965/66 by Rs. 27 million as a result of higher expenditure on administration, social services, economic services, Government enterprises, interest on public debt and pensions. Nevertheless, the substantial reduction in the annual feed subsidy bill was a very significant feature of Government's fiscal operations in 1966/67.",

The net cash deficit(after adjustment for sinking fund contributions, special payments to international organisations, and operations on advance accounts) was Rs. 606 million, as against Rs. 566 million in the previous year. This increase o f Rs. 40 million in the net cash deficit was the combined result of increased capital and re\u00adcurrent expenditure offset to some extent by increased revenue. In the financing of the net cash deficit, as shown in Table I - 1, Government had recourse to the banking system to the extent of only Rs. 51 million, in contrast to borrowings from the banking system of Rs. 162 million in the previous year. Financing from non-bank sources, including foreign finance, increased from Rs. 486 million to Rs. 578 million, while cash balances including Commodity Aid Counterpart Funds increased by Rs. 23 million. U.S. Aid Counterpart Funds held to the credit o f the U.S. Government with the Central Bank declined by Rs. 27 million. The combined result of these financing operations was a net expansionary gap of Rs. 55 million which was substantially lower than that of the previous year when it was Rs. 122 million.",

This achievement was largely the result of the .substantial increase in commodity loans from Rs. 35 million in the previous year to Rs. 192 million in 1966/67.1 While market borrowing from domestic non-bank sources increased by Rs. 41 million, this increase was made possible by the Central Bank redeeming its own securities to the value of Rs. 53 million held by savings institutions which in turn contributed this sum to Government securities. It is significant that, but for this extraordinary circumstance, domestic market borrowing from non-bank sources would actually have declined. As this decline would have occurred entirely in the contributions of the savings institutions, the importance of measures designed to increase their deposits and discourage undue withdrawals cannot be over-emphasized. In this context, the Monetary Board has proposed to the Government the need to improve the facilities provided by these savings institu\u00adtions and also to pay a higher rate of interest to depositors. A rather disappointing feature was that actual net receipts from foreign project loans and grants amounted to only Rs. 17 million, whereas the anticipation at the time the Budget was presented was Rs. 83 million ; but for this shortfall in project loans and grants, there would",

That offers a part of the explanation. Out of the increase in bank credit to the Government and the decline in cash balances totalling Rs. 256 million, as much as Rs. 148 million occured between the end of September and the end of December 1967. During this period the Government was building up focd stocks, a part of the payments for which were made through the banking system which extended credit to Government by holding Government's import (food) bills. Largely as a result of; the building up of food stocks Government's import bills held by the banks increased by Rs. 140 million during the year.",

In fact, it was felt that the margin provided to these exporters would have been too high and a part o f it was siphoned off through higher export duties. Ceylon's efforts to increase export earnings, however, should now be more appropriately diverted to providing greater incentives to a wide range o f industrial and minor agricultural products. While the devaluation would provide some additional incentive to producers o f these goods to expand exports and seek new markets, breaking into these highly competitive markets may require greater incentive and export promotion efforts than those provided by the devaluation alone.",

These data, however, conceal the fact that the stocks of imported rice and flour held by the Feed Commissioner at the end of 1967 were higher than the stocks held at the end of 1966 by 37,500 tons and 76,300 tons, respectively. When allowance is made for this factor, the actual foreign exchange outlay on food in 1967 would have been lower than that in 1966. It must also be realised that food requirements in 1967 would have been higher than in 1966 on account of the increase in population. This would indicate that some headway has already been made in 1967 in reducing foreign exchange outlays on food imports.",

They are, by and large, import substituting industries, but rely very heavily on imported raw materials, as shown by data presented in the section on Industrial Development in this Report. A further feature of these industries is that they have grown up under the protection provided by import bans which apply largely to non-essential goods, and; hence, these industries do not necessarily reflect national priorities.",

    "text": "The performance of these private sector industries is necessarily dependent on the foreign exchange allocation for raw materials, relying as they do so heavily on imported raw materials. In the Foreign Exchange Budgets for 1966 and 1967, as well as the draft Budget fcr 1968, increasing allocations of foreign exchange have been made for private sector industry. In some cases, foreign exchange allocations have been kept deliberately low to prevent the undue expansion o f low priority industries ; but, in most cases, the allocations though higher than previously have been below capacity requirements in view o f the overall inadequacy of foreign ex\u00adchange resources. Not only have these allocations been low but their timing has also been uneven on account of the need to watch carefully the emerging foreign exchange situation prior to actual release of allocations. Given rapid import sub\u00adstitution in the agricultural sector, the country should be in a position to afford larger outlays of foreign exchange for the industrial sector. If that can be combined with selective liberalisation o f raw material imports, the industrial sector should be in a position to play its role since it has the capacity to produce very much more than it has done in the past.",

The monetary situation remained under control but there were indications o f excessive expansion towards the end o f the year. The supply situation was better, even though imported supplies were lower than in the previous year. The price level was somewhat higher than in 1966. The balance o f payments situation continued to cause grave concern. Measures to alleviate the pressure on foreign exchange for food imports were beginning to show results in 1967, while import substitution in industry was assisted through higher allocations o f foreign exchange for imports o f raw materials. The Rupee itself was devalued in November 1967 as a step towards correcting the fundamental disequilibrium in the balance o f payments. In order to derive the full benefits o f the devaluation it would be necessary to adopt supporting measures while preventing an excessive monetary expansion.",
