    "text": "Ceylon's external reserves (net o f Sterling Loans Sinking Funds) had declined by almost Rs. 126 million in the course o f 1966, and in view o f its low level it was impossible to conceive financing a current account deficit o f the magnitude o f Rs. 329 million out o f these resources. In the event, however, Ceylon's ability to finance a volume of payments far in excess o f currently earned income in 1967 was due to a larger inflow of aid and short term borrowings abroad, mainly from the International Monetary Fund. If such resources were not available to the Ceylon economy in 1967, the only choice would have been to countenance a lower level of economic activity and a lower rate of economic growth. In fact the rate of economic growth in the past few years has been barely sufficient to cope with the annual increase in population and to absorb the increase in the country's workforce. A n encouraging feature in 1967, however, has been the fact that increased amounts o f external resources have been diverted to productive uses and conscious attempts have been made in framing the import budget, to change the composition o f imports in favour o f investment and raw material goods, as explained in greater detail in subsequent sections.",

    "text": "Another important facet of the financing of Ceylon's payments deficits in recent years has been the increasing resort to the accumulation of short term liabilities, mostly with a maturity pattern of less than five years. The principal component of such short term liabilities has been drawings from the International Monetary Fund, of which the outstanding total amounts to U.S. Dollars 79.0 million; of this sum U.S. Dollars 19.5 million consists of drawings under the International Monetary Fund's Compensatory Financing Scheme for fluctuations in export incomes. Drawings from the International Monetary Fund have continued to provide a substantial volume of external resources in the last three years ; they amounted to U.S. $ 22.9 million in 1965, U.S. $ 30.2 million in 1966 and U.S. $ 25.7 million in 1967. In 1967, Ceylon's external resources were further supplemented by increasing the indebtedness on bilateral payments agreements account by Rs. 80 million and short term borrowings from foreign banking sources of Rs. 57 million. In sum, therefore, of the external resources available to Ceylon in 1967, only 77 per cent was obtained from earned resources while 23 per cent of resources were secured through various short and long term borrowing arrangements. This picture compares unfavourably with the years 1965 and 1966, when 89 per cent and 79 per cent respectively of Ceylon's external resources were secured from earned income. This however, was inevitable in the context of a pronounced decline in export incomes\u2014principally due to a decline in average export prices\u2014and a rise in imports necessitated by the need to increase the tempo of economic activity in the country, after the very low levels reached in 1964, which in itself was to a large extent due to a marked decline in import capacity, caused mainly by adverse move\u00adments in Ceylon's terms of trade.",

    "text": "Of the external resources of Rs. 2,393 million available to Ceylon in'1967, as in previous years, more than four fifths was used for the purchase of merchandise imports. Thirteen per cent of such imports were financed out of aid, as compared with 11 per cent in 1966 and only 7 per cent in 1965. However, in 1967, the orienta\u00adtion in the import programme was more marked towards investment goods and raw materials, both in terms of expenditure out of owned and aid resources. The effects of such changes in the pattern of imports on the structure of production were evident in increases in output for home use, both in non-export agriculture and in industrial production. For example, there was a marked increase in 1967 in the import of agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, tractors, and other transport equip\u00adment, machinery and industrial raw material. Quite apart from the fact that increased aid inflows in 1967 facilitated the import of investment and raw material imports, considerable relief was also obtained on capital account since the volume of resources devoted to servicing old loans and payments on invisibles account were moderate in 1967. In the case of payments in respect of invisibles, while there were increases in outflows in respect of investment income, and interest payments, they were offset somewhat by a fall in migrants' transfers. There was also a marked decline in the volume of resources devoted to the amortization of old loans; this was however, mainly due to the fact that there was a substantial decline in 1967 in the payments due on drawings from the International Monetary Fund.",

The decline in export values in 1967 was due largely to a decline in the average price of Ceylon's major exports, viz., tea, rubber and coconut, as compared with 1966. The average f.o.b. price of tea declined further by 4-7 per cent to Rs. 2 -22 per pound and the f.o.b. price of rubber declined by 14 -2 per cent to 97 cents per pound, in 1967. The average f.o.b. price of coconut oil fell by 11-7 per cent to Rs. 1,314 per ton in 1967. Small declines in price were also observed in the case of copra and desiccated coconut. These price declines for Ceylon's major exports were to a large extent a reflection of the poor world market conditions for primary commodities in 1967. Political disturbances abroad, the availability of large stocks in some of the principal buying centres and the recession in economic activity in some of the leading industrial countries superimposed on global increases in supplies of these commodities and of near substitutes, and in some cases, an acceleration of stockpile disposals, all contributed in some measure towards the disturbing price trends for Ceylon's primary product exports in 1967.",

    "text": "In the past few years Ceylon had been able to partially compensate for the adverse price trends in respect of her major exports by output increases, chiefly due to increases in productivity. In 1967, however, output failed to respond sufficiently to compensate for adverse price declines in the case of tea and coconut, partly because of adverse weather conditions. In the case of tea, however, the volume of exports increased as compared with 1966, but mainly due to a reduction of stocks. In the absence of such a reduction in stocks the value of tea exports would have fallen significantly below the levels reached in 1966. Coconut exports declined both in volume and value, as a result of a decline in output superimposed on a fall in price. The cyclone experienced in the principal coconut growing areas in 1967 was a major contributory factor to the decline in export volume. In the case of rubber, however, there was an increase of 9 -3 per cent in output in 1967, as compared with the previous year. Yet the volume of exports declined by nearly 2 *3 per cent partly due to an increase in local consumption and partly due to the build up of exportable stocks as a result of labour and shipping difficulties.",

    "text": "An encouraging feature of the structure of imports in 1967, has been a marked shift in favour of imports of investment goods and raw materials and a reduction in the proportion of imports of consumer goods, particularly those with a high potential for import substitution. This has been brought about by deliberate foreign exchange budgeting and partly as a result of an expansion in the volume of output in the import substituting industrial and agricultural sectors themselves. The enhanced output in these sectors has been made possible by an increase in the import allocations for raw materials and investment goods in 1967 and earlier years. Thus food and drink imports in 1967 declined in value by almost Rs. 15 million to Rs. 797 million. In this category, rice imports alone declined by Rs. 43 million to only Rs. 225 million. Currystuff imports also declined by Rs. 24 million to Rs. 69 million, though flour imports increased by Rs. 80 million to Rs. 217 million. The value of imports of dairy products, fish and fish preparations, and beverages also declined by varying amounts. The value of textile imports declined by as much as Rs. 72 million to Rs. I l l million, while imports of drugs declined by Rs. 12 million to Rs. 22 million. In contrast, the value of intermediate goods increased by Rs. 15 million and that of investment goods rose by Rs. 8 million. Increases were recorded in the value of imports of fertilizers, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery.",

A substantial proportion of this aid was oriented to imports of capital and raw material, though in some cases essential consumer goods, particularly food items were also obtained. Thus machinery imports financed by aid in 1967 totalled almost Rs. 92 million, of which Rs. 33 -5 million consisted of project aid imports while Rs. 58 million consisted of commodity aid. Fertilizer imports to the value of Rs. 43 million (or approximately half the value of such imports in 1967) were also obtained under commodity aid programmes. The value of transport equipment obtained under commodity aid programmes totalled Rs. 55 million. Other commodities obtained under such programmes included flour (Rs. 24 million), fish and fish preparations (Rs. 4 million) and drugs (Rs. 1 million).",

The decline in the volume o f traffic calling at the Port of Colombo in recent years had resulted in a diminished volume of income from this source, but there are indications that earnings are once more tending to increase. For example, receipts on account of port and harbour dues increased from Rs. 100 million in 1965 to Rs. 107 million in 1967. The surplus on this account has increased from Rs. 96 million in 1965 to Rs. 108 million in 1966 but fell to Rs. 106 million in 1967. Improvements in the facilities provided combined with greater efficiency in the handling of cargo has no doubt helped to minimize demurrage payments to foreign shipping and to thereby save foreign exchange. The relatively moderate earnings in 1967 in respect of port and harbour dues as compared with the previous year, could be attributed to the lower volume of shipping calling at Colombo as a result of the Middle. East crisis in 1967 and the subsequent diversion of passenger fines 'via the Cape route.",

    "text": "The decision to devalue the Ceylon rupee by 20 per cent on 22nd November, 1967, arose partly as a result of long term factors that had resulted in an over\u00advaluation of the Ceylon rupee, and partly as a result of the devaluation of the U.K. Pound in November 1967. From the long-term standpoint, the expansionary impact of the monetary-fiscal imbalance which had continued for some time in Ceylon had resulted in the imposition of severe import and exchange controls on the one hand and bred circumventions through the over-invoicing of imports and under-invoicing of exports, on the other, with a consequent loss in foreign exchange.",

    "text": "Rising domestic prices and costs, particularly in the export sector had also tended to diminish progressively Ceylon's competitive capacity. It had therefore, been increasingly appreciated that both with a view towards restricting the demand for imports, providing added incentive to import substitution agriculture and industry and with a view towards affording some relief to exporters, an adjustment of the overvalued exchange rate appeared to be necessary. It was felt that the devaluation of the U.K. Pound would have sooner or later brought out the weakness in Ceylon's exchange rate into sharper focus, with adverse consequences for export income.",
