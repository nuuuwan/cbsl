    "text": "The index covering food items, which was generally exerting a downward pull on the average consumer prices upto the end of 1962, has moved up rapidly during the subsequent years. This upward movement was mainly due to scarcities caused by increasing restrictions on imports of food items. The average price of food to the consumer, as indicated by the index, increased by 3 -3 per cent from 109 -1 in 1966 to 112 -7 in 1967. Consequent on the reduction of the quantity of rice issued on ration in December 1966, the level of the index for food went up. The level would have gone up further but for the exclusion of open market rice from the index after the revision of the weights in the cereal group subsequent to the reduc\u00adtion in the ration. The average index of the cereal group went up further when the maximum price of a pound of wheat flour was administratively raised, in two stages, from 23 cents at the beginning of 1966 to 33 cents at the end of 1967. Even though the price of sugar was increased by 5 cents per pound in December 1967, its effect on the average price for the year was negligible. From the beginning of 1967 the Milk Board increased its price of milk by 13 cents per bottle in order to encourage the milk producers by giving them a better price. During the year prices of milk powder and other milk products also increased. Within the food group other significant price increases were recorded against chillies, coriander and garlic, onions, pulses, meat, potatoes and yams. The items that experienced a decline in prices were tea dust, fish, eggs, butter, jam, vegetables and salt. Further reduction in imports of items such as milk food, chillies, onions and pulses resulted in periodic scarcities. The sharp increase in the prices of potatoes and yams was the result of the complete ban on the import of the former.",

In 1965, however, the availability of a certain amount of textile on ration at low prices resulted in a slight fall in the index. The following year the retail distribution of textiles was further improved and the C.W.E. played a major role in it. This resulted in a decline of, as much as, 7 -7 per cent in the index from 1965 to 1966. The same scheme of distribution was maintained through 1967 and the price of textiles during this period remained almost at the same level as in 1966.",

At the end of the year the price of mild steel bars was 23 per cent more than at the beginning, while over the same period asbestos sheets rose by 33 per cent and galvanized sheets indicated price increases ranging from 44 to 60 per cent. The increase in the import licence fee in July was passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices, and it is also likely that the prices were put up immediately after devaluation, even on those items that were in stock. In other cases it is likely that the dealers would put up prices with the arrival of new con\u00adsignments of goods. While there has been a general price increase in respect of most goods, the prices in the paints and oil group have been somewhat stable. The fall in price of fertilizers by 3 per cent was noteworthy.",
