(E) GOVERNMENT FINANCE

Part A - The Financial Year 1966/67

The fiscal operations of the Government for the financial year October, 1966

to September, 1967, with corresponding data for previous financial years are summa­

rised in Tables 11(E) 1 and II (E) 6. As indicated therein, the salient features o f

Government's fiscal operations in the financial year 1966/67 were as follows :—

(a) Total revenue was Rs. 1,954.7 million as compared with Rs. 1,833.3

million in 1965/66 and Rs. 1,816.4 million in 1964/65.

(b) Total voted expenditure (l) was Rs. 2,520.0 million as compared with

Rs. 2,388.9 million in 1965/66 and Rs. 2,274.6 million in 1964/65. Of this total, recurrent expenditure was Rs. 1,895.3 million, compared with Rs. 1,860.5 million

in 1965/66 and Rs. 1,803.4 million in 1964/65; while expenditure chargeable to capital votes was Rs. 624.7 million, as compared with Rs. 528.4 million and

Rs. 471.2 million in 1965/66 and 1964/65 respectively.

(c) Operations on advance accounts resulted in a net payment of Rs. 40.7

million. This compares with a net payment of Rs. 10.4 million and a net receipt

o f Rs. 27.8 million in 1965/66 and 1964/65 respectively.

(d) The net cash deficit resulting from these operations was Rs. 606.0 million,

as compared with Rs. 566.0 million in 1965/66 and Rs. 430.4 million in 1964/65.

(e) The net cash deficit in 1966/67 was financed by borrowing Rs. 348.3

million from domestic market sources, obtaining Rs. 208.6 million by way of foreign

finance and securing Rs. 72.2 million from domestic non-market sources; the excess after meeting the deficit being used to augment cash balances, including Commodity

Aid counterpart funds, by Rs. 23.3 million.

(f) The expansionary impact of the net cash deficit when adjusted for a change

in U.S. Aid counterpart funds was Rs. 55.2 million as compared with Rs. 122.4

million in 1965/66 and Rs. 34.7 million in 1964/65.

Revenue

In Table 19 of Appendix II, the original estimates and the actual (provisional) revenue collections for 1966/67 are shown together with the actual revenue collec­tions for 1965/66, under the main heads of revenue as appearing in the Government Estimates. A satisfactory feature of Government fiscal operations in 1966/67 is the significant increase in revenue collections over those in the previous financial year. Actual (provisional) revenue for 1966/67 at Rs. 1,954.7 million was Rs. 121.4 million or 6.6 per cent higher than the corresponding figure (Rs. 1,833.3 million)

for 1965/66.

<1) Representing the total under items 1 (B) (i) and 1 (B) (ii) of Table 11 (E) 1.

( 9 7 )

Over the ten-year period 1956/57 to 1966/67, revenue has increased by 5 per •cent (compound) annually, and over the past 5 financial years by 4 per cent (com-rpound) annually. It is apparent therefore that the revenue increase in 1966/67 has been better than the average annual increase over the past 5 years, and, as men­tioned in the Annual Report of 1966, also stands in marked contrast to its perfor­mance in the financial year 1965/66. In that year, revenue increased by Rs. 16.8 million or only 0.9 per cent.

Per capita revenue, which had recorded a fall in 1965/66, rose significantly in the financial year 1966/67. This increase re-established the rising trend in per capita revenue experienced in the five financial years ending 1964/65. Revenue 4j>er capita) which was Rs. 162 in 1964/65, and fell to Rs. 160 in 1965/66 rose to Rs. 166 in 1966/67.

As compared with the original estimate of Rs. 2,033.0 million, the actual revenue -collected in 1966/67 showed a shortfall of Rs. 78.3 million. The corresponding over-estimation of revenue for 1965/66 was Rs. 64.6 million, in 1964/65 it was Rs. 4.9 million and in 1963/64, Rs. 28.6 million.

Table II (E) 2 depicts in detail the salient changes in the important items of .actual revenue (provisional) in 1966/67, compared with those of actual revenue for 1965/66 and the original estimates for 1966/67.

Revenue from imports in 1966/67 was Rs. 675 million higher than in the pre­vious financial year. The increase in revenue, obtained mainly from licence fees •on imports under licence (Rs. 21.3 million), and import duties on motor spirits and liquid fuel (Rs. 46.7 million) and grain and flour (Rs. 10.8 million) amounted to Rs. 78.8 million. This increase was offset to some extent mainly by a decrease in duty collections on sugar (Rs. 6.5 million) and 'other goods' (Rs. 17.1 million). The higher revenue from licence fees was due to a larger volume of imports subject to licence fees, the levying of a licence fee of 10 per cent on all textile imports(2) and an increase to 10 per cent of the existing licence fee oh several imported goods, as proposed in the Budget Speech for 1967/68 on July 25, 1967.(3) The rise in im­port duty collections on motor spirits and liquid fuel and flour was due to an increase in the volume of imports. Duty collections on rice, sugar and 'other goods' fell because of a decrease in the quantity imported.

In marked contrast to the increase in revenue collections from imports, revenue from taxes on exports in 1966/67, recorded a fall by as much as Rs. 25.7 million (10 per cent) when compared with that in 1965/66. While revenue collections from taxes on tea(4) increased slightly, by Rs. 2.8 million, the duty collections on rubber .and coconut products declined sharply by Rs. 18.5 million and Rs. 11.2 million respectively.

><3) Government Gazette Nos. 14758/8 of July 26, 1967; 14760/6 of August 9, 1967 arid 14764/6 of September 4,1967. Since the increase in licence fee came first into effect on July 26, 1967, a part of this increase has accrued to the revenue collections of 1966/67.

Collections from the (specific) export duty on tea fell by Rs. 7.6 million to Rs. 158.0 million. This decrease was the result of a contraction of 22.3 million lbs. (5 per cent) in the volume of tea exported. (J) The increase in collections from taxes on tea was therefore due entirely to an increase of Rs. 10.4 million in collections from the (ad-valorem) tea tax.

The fall in export duty collections on rubber was due to a drop in the f.o.b. price(2) in spite of an increase in the volumes exported. The average f.o.b. price of all grades of rubber declined sharply by 11 cts. (10 per cent) to Rs. 1.04 per lb. The volume of exports, which had increased over the two previous financial years increased further by 26.8 million lbs. to 306.6 million lbs. in the financial year under consideration.

A fall in the export duty receipts from all three major coconut products resul­ted in a decline in revenue of Rs. 11.2 million (36 per cent). Duty collections on copra fell by Rs. 3.3 million, while those on the export of coconut oil and desiccated coconut fell by Rs. 5.0 million and Rs. 2.8 million respectively, when compared with the duty collections in 1965/66. The decline in duty collections on copra and desiccated coconut resulted from a fall both in the price(3) and in the volume ex­ported, whereas the fall in duty collections from the export of coconut oil was due to a fall in prices which more than offset the slight increase in the volume of exports. Exports of coconut oil increased by 2.2 thousand tons,(4) while the export volume of copra and desiccated coconut decreased by 7.7 thousand tons(6) and 1.3 thousand tons,(4) respectively. The price trends in all three types of coconut products were also not encouraging. The f.o.b. price of copra declined by Rs. 1.99 per cwt. that of desiccated coconut by Rs. 10.65 per cwt., and that of coconut oil by Rs. 11.16 per cwt. As a consequence, the average price (f.o.b.) for all three types of coconut products which had fallen in the previous financial year, fell further by Rs. 8.96 (or 13 per cent) to Rs. 62.47 per cwt.

Profits from the sale of arrack and duties on country made liquor, (7) which had shown an increasing trend of revenue collections in the last five financial years, fell by Rs. 11.2 million and Rs. 2.0 million, respectively in the financial year under consideration. This decline is explained by the fact that while actual collections for the financial year 1965/66 amounted to Rs. 103.0 million, an additional Rs.15.0 million from past profits was credited to revenue in that year; the profits credited to revenue in 1966/67 represented receipts in that year only. The fall in revenue from the latter was due to the drop in the volume of sales of these types of liquor.

In contrast to the decrease in revenue from export duties and excises from li­quor, revenue collections from the tobacco tax and turnover tax continued to in­crease. Revenue collections from the tobacco tax rose by Rs. 18.8 million (16 per

(1) Exports of tea in 1966/67 were 452.2 million lbs. as against 474.5 million lbs. in 1965/66.

(2) Export duties on rubber are based on a sliding scale.

(3) Export duties on coconut products are based on a sliding scale. (4) Exports of coconut oil in 1965/66 were 69.9 thousand tons as compared with 72.1 thousand tons in 1966/67. (5) Exports of copra in 1965/66 were 26.3 thousand tons as compared with 18.7 thousand tons in 1966/67. (6) Exports of desiccated coconut in 1965/66 were 47.6 thousand tons as compared with 46,3 thou­sand tons in 1966/67. (7) Foreign liquor type, i,e. beer, gin, brandy antrum,

cent) and this rise was due to an increase in the sales of cigarette tobacco and in the excise duty on tobacco by Rs. 4.50 a l b ^1 ) The Annual Reports of 1965 and 1966 had occasion to refer to the significant growth in revenue collections from the tobacco tax in recent years. In this connection it is noteworthy that in the 5 year period 1961/62 to 1966/67 revenue from the tobacco tax has increased at a rate of 17 per cent (compound) annually.

Revenue from the Turnover Tax, which was Rs. 34.8 million in 1964/65 and Rs. 39.1 million in 1965/66, increased by Rs. 33.1'million, to provide Rs. 72.2 million or 4 per cent of total revenue collections in the financial year under considera­tion. This increase is consequent on an increase in the rates of the Business Turn­over Tax in July 1966, and an increase in the turnover of articles liable at the higher rate of 5 per cent. It is pertinent at this point to stress the revenue earning poten­tial of this tax which was first introduced only in October 1963. With the per­sistent decline in revenue from export duties and the structural changes that have taken place in the economy over the last decade, the judicious use of this tax may well produce a buoyant source of Government revenue in future years.

Income taxreceipts(2) in 1966/67 increased by Rs. 34.6 million to Rs 310.0 million.. The increase is due to more effective assessment and measures to combat tax evasion through intensified investigation, work done by the Regional Offices and registration of new tax payers. Similarly, the increase in collections from the personal tax repre­sents the progressive reduction of outstanding assessments of previous years.

Revenue from the National Lottery and gross receipts of trading enterprises(3) were the other two items of significance which recorded variations in 1966/67. Re­ceipts from the National Lottery increased by Rs 2.4 million, while the gross re­ceipts of trading enterprises increased by Rs. 2.8 million to Rs. 250.3 million, in spite of the fact that a part of the profits on Broadcasting has been excluded as the Department was converted into a Corporation during the financial year.(4) Of significance was the increase in the receipts of the Electrical and Railway Depart­ments by Rs. 5.2 million and Rs. 2.2 million, respectively, in the financial year under review.

Expenditure

Total voted expenditure of the Government,^) for the period 1955/56 to 1966/67, classified into expenditure chargeable to recurrent votes (votes 1,2, 4 and 6), and expenditure chargeable to capital votes (votes, 3, 5 and 7) is shown in Table 11(E) 3. The Table also depicts a time series of current expenditure, (6) capital expenditure (') and total expenditure o f the Government adjusted for expenditure incurred on advance account operations.

According to provisional figures currently available, total voted expenditure of the Government in 1966/67 amounted to Rs. 2,520.0 million, exceeding the ex­penditure of the previous financial year by Rs. 131.1 million (or 5.5 per cent) com­pared with an increase of Rs. 114.3 million or 5.0 per cent, in 1965/66. This in­crease was nevertheless smaller than the annual rate of 6.9 per cent in the growth of expenditure experienced over the ten financial years ending 1965/66.

The increase of Rs. 131.1 million in 1966/67, was the combined result of an in­crease in both recurrent and capital expenditure. While recurrent expenditure in­creased by only Rs. 34.8 million (or 2 per cent), perhaps the most satisfactory fea­ture of Government fiscal operations in 1966/67 was the increase in expenditure chargeable to capital votes by as much as Rs. 96.3 million (18 per cent) to Rs. 624.7 million; the highest achieved in any financial year.

When compared to the original estimates of voted expenditure for 1966/67,(l) the actual (provisional) expenditure of that year indicated a shortfall of Rs. 214.7 million. This was due to under-expenditures on capital votes of Rs. 137.0 million (18 per cent) and Rs. 77.7 million (4 per cent) on recurrent votes. In 1965/66 actual recurrent expenditure exceeded its estimate by 2 per cent. Current Expenditure

As indicated in Table 11(E) 3, actual (provisional) current expenditure in 1966/67 was only Rs. 26.5 million (or 2 per cent) higher than the current expenditure in 1965/66. In that year current expenditure increased by 4 per cent. The per­centage increase in 1966/67 is also much lower than the 8 per cent annual rate of increase in current expenditure which occurred in the ten year period 1955/56 to 1965/66.

Government current expenditure for the financial years 1964/65 to 1966/67, which is shown in greater detail in Table 21 of the Statistical Appendix o f this Re­port, is summarised in Table II (E) 4 below :—

The increased expenditure on current account in 1966/67 compared to that of 1965/66, is accounted for by an increase in expenditure on social services (Rs. 27.4 million), economic services (Rs. 15.6 million), administration (Rs. 15.6 million) and on government enterprises (Rs. 8.3 million) offset in part by a decline in transfer payments of Rs. 40.4 million.

The increased expenditure on social services was due to higher current expendi­ture on health and education, which is to be expected in a situation o f an increase in population and in the number of school-going children. The rise in expendi­ture on economic services reflected increases in current expenditure on agricul­ture and irrigation, and on commnications, while the increase in expenditure on ad­ministration was mainly due to higher expenditure on civil administration.

The decrease in transfer payments was wholly on account of a sharp drop in the net food subsidy. The actual food subsidy for 1965/66, together with the ori­ginal estimates and provisional figures of the outturn of food operations in 1966/67 are shown in Table 11(E) 5. The original estimate as appearing in the Budget, and a revised estimate o f the net food subsidy for the financial year 1967/68 are also shown for purposes o f comparison.

The Government decided on December 18, 1966 to change the ration and the price of rice. In place of two measures o f subsidised rice per ration book, per head, Government decided to issue one measure free. This policy decision and the con­sequent changes in the pattern of cereal consumption resulted in a reduction in the net food subsidy bill in 1966/67 by Rs. 80.8 million as compared with that of 1965/66. This reduction was the combined result o f several factors.

(1.) Estimated before the December, 1966 decision relating to rice distribution.

(2.) Estimated after the devaluation in November, 1967.

(3.) Anticipated loss.

( 106)

The profits from the sale of flour and sugar increased by Rs. 42.2 million and Rs. 14.2 million respectively, as compared with 1965/66. The large profits on the sale of flour was made possible by an increase in the volume of sales of 123,656 tons or 46 per cent and an increase in the sale price of flour by 5 cents per pound Profits on the sale of sugar, on the other hand, was on account of a fall in the lan­ded cost of sugar in 1966/67 as compared to the level of prices in 1965/66. While the sale price to the consumer remained constant, the average landed cost of sugar declined by Rs. 38 per ton to Rs. 440 per ton. As against this, the subsidy to the consumer on imported rice increased by Rs. 23.9 million as comapred with 1965/66. This happened despite a substantial fall in the quantity of rice purchased abroad, as a result of a sharp increase in the average landed cost of rice which increased from Rs. 586.47 to Rs. 648.58 per ton; an increase of Rs. 62.11 or 11 per cent. The volume of purchases, however, fell by 168,440 tons to 380,733 tons in 1966/67 or by 31 per cent. As indicated in Table II(E)5 the subsidy on the production and consumption of local rice declined by Rs. 63.3 million. This was partly on account of a fall in the quantity of rice purchased from the Commissioner of Agrarian Ser­vices and subsequently sold to the consumer, from 388,660 tons in 1965/66 to 215,600 tons in 1966/67. Distribution expenses and other charges increased by Rs. 5.2 million. As a consequence, the gross subsidy which was Rs. 489.9 million in 1965/66 fell by Rs. 34.2 million to Rs. 455.7 million in the financial year under review.

The net food subsidy taking into account profits from the sale of sugar, flour and other goods and the producer's subsidy on onions fell by Rs. 80.8 million as compared with 1965/66.

The volume of imported cereals (rice and flour) in the financial year 1966/67 is of significance, especially in view Of the December 1966 decision relating to the distribution of rice. The actual sales of imported cereals in 1965/66 was 0.830 million tons, whereas the sales of imported cereals in 1966/67 was 0.769 million tons.(2) There was thus a fall of 0.061 million tons (or 7.3 per cent) in the sales of imported cereals in the financial year under review.

Capital Expenditure

The actual (provisional) figure of capital expenditure in 1966/67, as indicated in Table 11(E) 3, was Rs. 701.5 million. This figure consists of expenditure under Votes 3, 5 and 7 in Government Accounts, expenditure of a capital nature inclu­ded in Votes 1, 2, 4 and 6, and expenditure chargeable to the National Development Reserve. Total capital expenditure defined in this manner, exceeded the corres­ponding figure in 1965/66 by Rs. 104.6 million or 18 per cent. Over the 10 year period 1955/56 to 1965/66 capital expenditure increased at an average annual rate of 5 per cent (compound). It is seen therefore that the increase in capital expendi­ture in 1966/67 was also much higher than the growth rate achieved in the ten previous financial years.

On further analysis it is seen that the significant element of growth in capital expenditure was in capital grants to government corporations. Grants to corpo-tions which were Rs. 122.5 million (or 23 per cent of total capital expenditure) in 1964/65, increased to Rs. 168.8 million (or 28 per cent) in 1965/66 and to Rs. 232.1 million (33 per cent) in 1966/67. On the other hand, central Government fixed capital formation which was Rs. 385.1 million in 1964/65, declined slightly in 1965/66, and increased by Rs. 39.9 million, to total Rs. 422.1 million in 1966/67, which is the highest level so far in any financial year.

(2) On data obtained from the Food Commissioner.

( 107 )

Table 21 of Appendix II presents a functional classification of capital expendi­ture. It is seen that there was a significant increase in expenditure on economic

services (Rs. 92.9 million). Within the category of economic services, expenditure

on manufacture and mining increased by Rs. 53.4 million, communications by

Rs. 23.7 million; and agriculture and irrigation by Rs. 15.9 million. Capital expen­diture on social services also increased by Rs. 16.0 million; there being an increase

in expenditure incurred on health, housing and education.

Advance Account Operations

Operations on advance accounts during 1966/67, resulted in a net payment of

Rs. 40.7 million, as compared with a net payment o f Rs. 10.4 million in 1965/66.

On the information presently available, details of these payments cannot be provi­

ded. However, the net payment was mainly due to an increase in advances to

Government departments, partly offset by a balance in favour of China under the

Rubber/Rice Agreement with the Peoples' Republic of China.

Net Cash Deficit

The net cash deficit of Rs. 606.0 million for the financial year 1966/67 was the

highest ever recorded. This was Rs. 40.0 million (or 7 per cent) more than the net

cash deficit (Rs. 566.0 million) o f 1965/66. The increase in the net cash deficit o f

1966/67 was due to an increase of Rs. 96.3 million in expenditure chargeable to capi­

tal votes, Rs. 34.8 million in recurrent expenditure and Rs. 30.3 million in payment

on account o f advance account operations, offset in part by an increase o f Rs. 121.4

million in revenue receipts. Although the net cash deficit increased by Rs. 40.0

million in 1966/67 this increase was much smaller than the increase in 1965/66 when

the net cash deficit increased by as much as Rs. 135.6 million or 32 per cent.

The actual (provisional) net cash deficit for 1966/67 was also higher than the

original estimate for that year by Rs. 29.8 million. The increase in the actual net

cash deficit for 1966/67 as compared to the original estimate of that year was due to a shortfall in revenue receipts (Rs. 78.3 million), offset in part by a shortfall o f

Rs. 48.5 million in expenditure^1) The fall in expenditure was on account o f a

fall both in recurrent(2) and capital^) expenditure of Rs. 28.4 million and Rs. 60.8

million respectively, in spite o f a net payment o f Rs. 40.7 million on advance account

operations.

The net cash deficit of Rs. 606.0 million resulting from the fiscal operations in the financial year 1966/67 was financed by borrowing Rs. 297.0 million from domestic non-bank sources, obtaining Rs. 208.6 million by way of foreign assistance, Rs. 72.2 million from domestic non-market sources and Rs. 51.3 million from the banking system. Cash balances (including counterpart funds) increased by Rs. 23.3 million.

The net cash deficit for 1966/67, for the reasons mentioned earlier in this section, increased by Rs. 40.0 million. However, the expansionary component of the net cash deficit declined both in absolute terms and as a ratio of the deficit in the finan­cial year under consideration when compared with that of 1965/66. The expansio­nary impact of the deficit in 1966/67 was Rs. 55.2 million and was Rs. 67.2 million less than the corresponding figure for 1965/66. The expansionary component of the net cash deficit as a ratio of the deficit also fell from 21.6 per cent in 1965/66 to 9.1 per cent in 1966/67. This was largely due to the greatly increased reliance on foreign finance and domestic non-bank sources for financing the deficit associated with a diminution of borrowing from the banking system.

As indicated in the Table II (E) 6 the net borrowing of Rs. 51.3 million from the banking system was solely on account of a greatly increased reliance on the Central Bank for budgetary purposes. Borrowing from the Central Bank increased by Rs. 125.7 million and consisted of an increase of Rs. 119.3 million in treasury bills and Rs. 7.0 million in Central Bank advances offset in part by a small decrease (Rs. 0.6 million) in Central Bank's holdings of Government securities. On the other hand there was a net decrease in borrowing from commercial banks (1). This decrease (Rs. 74.5 million) was the combined result of a fall in holdings of Govern­ment securities (Rs. 42.7 million) and treasury bills (Rs. 31.9 million), partly offset by a rise of Rs. 0.1 million in commercial bank holdings of tax reserve certificates.

Net market borrowing from non-bank sources in 1966/67 of Rs. 297.0 million was higher than that of 1965/66 (Rs. 255.9 million). The amount of resources realised in 1966/67 includes however a sum of Rs. 53.4 million of Government securities purchased by savings institutions, consquent on a repurchase by the Central Bank, of its own securities. Net of this figure, it can be seen that market borrowing from non-bank sources has in fact fallen in the financial year under consideration. The significance of this decline is best apperciated when it is seen that in the period 1961/62 to 1965/66 contributions by this sector had shown an average annual increase of Rs. 36.6 million. It also serves to emphasize the need to increase finances from this source in future financial years, especially if Government borrowing from ex­pansionary sources are to be kept at a tolerable level. In this connection the pay­ment of a higher rate of interest on Government borrowings to enable the savings institutions to pay a higher rate of interest on savings has been recommended by the Monetary Board.

Savings institutions, the Employees' Provident Fund, and departmental and other official funds significantly improved their share of contributions to Government securities in 1966/67. In Table II (E) 7 is set out the contributions by major non-bank investor groups to government securities (including treasury bills and tax reserve certificates) in 1966/67, with comparative data for the three previous financial years.

(1.) This excludes credit to the Government froim,the commercial banks in the form of holdings

of import bills as stated in footnote (1) of table II (E) 6.

Foreign finance^) received in 1966/67 amounted to Rs. 255.6 million, as com­pared with Rs. 153.9 million in the previous financial year and Rs. 116.9 million in 1964/65. Since sterling loan sinking fund contributions and other foreign loan repayments amounted to Rs. 47.0 million, net foreign assistance in 1966/67 totalled Rs. 208.6 million.The corresponding figures for 1965/66 and 1964/65 were Rs. 118.0 million and Rs. 99.7 million, respectively.

As indicated in Table II(E)6 the significant increase in foreign finance that occured in 1966/67 was on account of loan finance; and that too in the form of commodity loans. A more detailed analysis o f foreign loan assistance is given in the section on Foreign Debt in this Report. It would be sufficient at this stage to point out the diminished significance of project loan assistance (both gross and net) and grants for public sector capital formation in the financial year 1966/67.

In Table II (E)8 are detailed the receipts of foreign assistance by type and source. Foreign grants which amounted to Rs. 41.5 million in 1965/66 fell to Rs. 19.3 million in 1966/67. The Canadian Government, as in the previous financial year, provided the largest amount of grant aid (Rs. 12.8 million). The Australian Government and United Nations Organizations also provided grant aid of Rs. 4.6 million and Rs. 1.5 million, respectively.

Public Debt

Data in respect of public debt are shown in Tables 23 and 24 of Appendix II. The significance o f the domestic and foreign components of total public debt (gross and net), as at the end of the last five financial years is presented in Table 11(E) 9, and analysed below.

The increases in gross debt and net debt in the financial year 1966/67 were Rs. 578.2 million and Rs. 514.7 million, respectively. Corresponding figures for the previous financial year were Rs. 558.5 million and Rs. 495.7 million, respectively. The increase in gross debt of Rs. 478.2 million was composed of an increase of Rs. 310.2 million in rupee securities, Rs. 190.5 million in foreign debt, Rs. 75.0 million in treasury bills, and Rs. 9.0 million in Central Bank advances, offset by a reduction of Rs. 6.5 million in tax reserve certificates. The increases in total public debt (both gross and net) in the financial year 1966/67 was higher than in any of the previous four financial years.

It is also of significance that the foreign debt component of total net debt has increased by 2.6 percentage points in the financial year under review. A steadily rising trend of foreign debt is now discernible; net foreign debt more than doubled in absolute terms over the last four financial years. Net domestic debt increased by only half over the same period.

Domestic Debt

Gross domestic debt, which stood at Rs. 4,194.5 million on September 30, 1966, increased by Rs. 387.7 million by the end o f the financial year 1966/67. The com­position of the debt as on that date was as follows : rupee securities Rs. 2,784.8 million, treasury bills Rs. 1,500.0 million, tax reserve certificates Rs. 25.7 million, Central Bank advances Rs. 271.6 million and national development bonds Rs.0.1 million.

The maturity pattern of gross domestic debt as at September 30, 1967 with cor­responding data for the four previous financial years is shown in Table II (E) 11. In the Annual Report for 1966 it was observed that the term structure of domestic debt had lengthened over the last three financial years. This tendency has been continued in the financial year 1966/67. Domestic debt with over twenty years to latest date of maturity comprised 31.7 per cent of total domestic debt, an increase of 5.0 percentage points during the financial year. Correspondingly, the unfunded debt component fell by 1.8 percentage points to constitute 39.2 per cent of the total as at the end of September, 1967.

Rupee Securities :

Fifteen rupee loans amounting to Rs. 390.8 million were issued in the course of the financial year. Of these, three loans, amounting to Rs. 50.9 million, were con­version loans, and one, a 5-7 year 3J% loan amounting to Rs. 3.6 million was a cash issue. The balance eleven (21-25 year) loans aggregating Rs. 336.3 million, were also cash issues at per cent. Net of conversion loans the resources raised by rupee securities was Rs. 340.0 million. Of the three conversion loans, the 3J per cent Loan 1970/72 was raised in part conversion of the 3 | per cent Loan 1965/67, the 2>\ per cent Loan 1972/75 was raised in part conversion of the 2 | per cent Loan 1965/67, while the 3 | per cent Loan 1970/71 was raised in part conversion of the 3£ per cent Loan 1965/67 " B " Series, which matured during the year. The other twelve issues were entirely for cash. A classification of the allotments is shown in Table II (E) 12,

A significant feature of the ownership pattern of securities over the last five financial years is the sizeable contribution made by the semi-government sector. (2) In the period 1962/63 to 1966/67 the holdings of these institutional investors in­creased from 58 per cent to 69 per cent of total rupee securities. The contributions of resources by the Employees' Provident Fund and the Insurance Corporation has increased steadily. In fact the Employees' Provident Fund is the largest single holder of Government securities.

The rate of interest on long term (21 to 25 year) Government loans which was increased from 4J per cent to 4-J- per cent on June 1, 1963, has remained at that level since.

Treasury Bills

The volume of treasury bills outstanding at the beginning o f the financial year 1966/67 was Rs. 1,425.0 million; the authorised limit at that date being Rs. 1,500.0 million. By the end of the financial year, the amount o f treasury bills issued and outstanding stood at Rs. 1,500.0 million, resulting in an increase o f Rs. 75.0 million during the financial year, and leaving no unutilised balance out oj the existing limit of treasury bill issues^1)

Holdings o f treasury bills by the banking system as at the end of September, 1967 were Rs. 1,456.7 million (97.1 per cent o f the total outstanding) as compared with Rs. 1,369.3 million (96.1 per cent) as at September 30, 1966. Of this total, Central Bank holdings of treasury bills were Rs. 1,377.2 million (91.8 per cent of the total outstanding) as at the end of September, 1967, compared with Rs. 1,257.9 million (88.3 per cent) as at September 30, 1966.

There was no change in the rate of interest on treasury bills, which remained at 3.0 per cent per annum. Central Bank support for treasury bills also remained at 1.0 per cent per annum throughout the financial year.

Tax Reserve Certificates

Out of a total authorised issue of Rs. 250.0 million, tax reserve certificates amounting to Rs. 240.7 million have been issued up to end of September 1967. Rs. 25.7 million of certificates remained unsurrendered at that date. The amount unsurrendered at the end of the previous financial year was Rs. 32.2 million, resul­ting therefore in a decline in this type of debt obligations of Rs. 6.5 million.

The rate of interest on tax reserve certificates which was increased from 1 per cent to \ \ per cent in August, 1961, has remained at that level since then.

Central Bank Advances

Advances to Government under section 89 of the Monetary Law Act amounted to Rs. 262.6 million at the end of 1965/66. The corresponding figure at the end o f September 1967, was Rs. 271.6 million, resulting in an increase o f Rs. 9.0 million during, the financial year under consideration. The figures at the end of each financial year, includes however, special loans towards payment of Ceylon's membership subscriptions to international financial organizations of Rs. 82.4 million and Rs. 84.4 million, respectively. Net of these payments, Central Bank advances increasd by Rs. 7.0 million in 1966/67.

Foreign Debt

In 1966/67, gross foreign debt (i.e. net of repayments, but before deducting sinking funds), increased by Rs. 190.5 million, as compared with an increase of Rs. 59.6 million in 1965/66. Total withdrawals, in the financial year under review amounted to Rs. 236.2 million, of which Rs. 42.3 million was on account of project loans; the balance Rs. 193.9 million representing the foreign liabilities under com­modity loans provided to Ceylon. Repayments during the financial year consisted almost wholly of project loan liabilities and amounted to Rs. 45.7 million. Gross foreign debt (i.e. net of repayments, but before deducting sinking funds), therefore increased by Rs. 190.5 million in 1966/67, as against an increase of Rs. 59.5 million in the previous financial year. Details of the increase in 1966/67 are given in Table II (E) 14, and analysed below.

(1) The authorised limit of the treasury bill issue was raised by Rs. 250 million to Rs. 1,750 million by Parliament on January 27, 1968.

Project Loans

Foreign assistance by way of project loans is for public sector projects, and the utilisation of such foreign assistance amounted to Rs. 42.3 million in 1966/67. Since repayments in that financial year amounted to Rs. 43.5 million, there was a net reduction of foreign liabilities on account of project loans of Rs. 1.2 million. The diminished significance of foreign project assistance to the public sector is apparent when it is seen that in 1965/66 there was a net increase in project assistance of Rs. 48.9 million, while in 1964/65 the net increase was as much as Rs. 77.9 million.

As indicated in Table II (E) 14 the major portion of the project assistance uti­lised came from West Germany (Rs. 18.6 million), for the cement industry, cast iron foundry and the development of the Port of Colombo; from the I.B.R.D. (Rs. 6.6 million) for the Norton Bridge Hydro and Grandpass Thermal projects; and from Canada (Rs. 11.5 million) for the supply of equipment and engineering services for the Maskeliya Oya Hydro project and for the development o f the Katunayake Airport.

* i.e. withdrawals less repayments.

+ Sinking funds maintained for the redemption of sterling securities amounted to Rs. 31.3 million. Adjusted for these sinking funds the net total liability amounted to Rs. 708.0 million.

Commodity Loans

Foreign assistance by way of commodity loans was first availed of in the year 1965/66, and differs from project loans in that it consists mainly of assistance to the private sector. In the financial year 1965/66, foreign liabilities totalling Rs. 35.2 million were incurred^). Foreign assistance in that year consisted mainly of loans from the United Kingdom (Rs. 18.9 million), for the import of fertilizer, vehicles and spares, and base metals; from Japan (Rs.10.0 million), for the import of fertilizers, textiles, and motor tyres and tubes; and from India (Rs. 2.6 million) for the import of dried chillies and textiles.

In the financial year 1966/67, utilisation of commodity aid increased signifi­cantly and amounted to Rs. 193.9 million. This consisted mainly of loans from the United Kingdom (Rs. 54.5 million), for the import of industrial raw materials and fertilizer; from West Germany (Rs. 52.0 million), for the import of fertilizer and motor spares; from the United States (Rs. 32.4 million), for the import of fertilizer and motor accessories; from Japan (Rs. 31.3 million) for the import of textiles, and motor spares and accessories; from France (Rs. 11.9 million) for the import of vehi­cles and motor accessories; and from India (Rs. 10.1 million) for the import of tex­tiles and dried fish.

The foreign liability outstanding on account of commodity loans at the end of the financial year 1966/67, after taking into account a repayment of Rs. 2.1 mil­lion on the Indian Government loan, was Rs. 227.0 million. This constituted over 30 per cent of the gross foreign debt outstanding as at that date.

Table 27 of Appendix II presents in summary form the rupee counterpart funds generated and their utilisation for budgetary purposes in the period under review(2). At the end of the financial year 1965/66, Rs. 36.9 million had been credited to this account; there being no withdrawals by the Government. In the financial year 1966/67 there were credits totalling Rs. 195.2 million to this account. Since a sum of Rs. 150.0 million was utilised during that financial year for budgetary purposes, the amount outstanding in the account increased by Rs. 45.2 million to Rs. 82.1 million.

Borrowing by semi-Government Institutions

The Central Bank followed the same policy as in the four previous financial years of channelling all available resources to Government needs, and advising the Government to lend out of loan funds, any monies to the Commissioner of Natio­nal Housing, depending on the needs of the institutions and the state of Government finances.

1. National Housing Department

There were no issues of National Housing Debentures in 1966/67; the total of National Housing Debentures issued and outstanding remaining at Rs. 75.0 million. Direct loans sanctioned by Government increased by Rs. 26.0 million to Rs. 121.0 million by the end of September 1967. The value of sinking funds established for the redemption of National Housing Debentures stood at Rs. 37.4 million.

( 120)

2. State Mortgage Bank

There were no new issues of State Mortgage Bank Debentures in the financial year under consideration; the Debentures issued and outstanding remaining at Rs. 33.3 million. The major portion of the Bank's operations during the financial year was carried out through overdraft facilities provided by the banking system. While the borrowing limits of the State Mortgage Bank were increased by Rs. 5.0 million to Rs. 75.6 million, overdrafts guaranteed under Sections 73, 75 and 84 of the State Mortgage Bank Ordinance, also increased by Rs. 5.0 million to Rs. 42.3 million by the end of the financial year. Since Debentures issued and outstanding amounted to Rs. 33.3 million, there was no balance in the borrowing limit at the end of 1966/67.

1. Licence fee on imports

The existing licence fee of 1 per cent (other than on textiles which were already charged a licence fee of 10 per cent), was increased to 10 per cent(1). Certain goods were exempted from this increase. They were milk, milk foods, infants and invalids' foods, cotton yarn, drugs and pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, kerosene, newsprint, mammoties and other small implements for agricultural use. Imports of Govern­ment Departments, including those of the Food Commissioner continued to be wholly exempt from any licence fee. This measure was expected to yield an addi­tional revenue of Rs. 80 million.

2. Tobacco Tax

The excise duty on tobacco of Rs. 28.50 per lb. was increased by Rs. 4.50 per lb(2). This was expected to bring in an additional revenue of Rs. 15 million.

(1) Government Gazette Nos. 14,758/8 of July 26 1967; 14,760/6 of August 9,1967 ; and 14,764/ 9 of September 4, 1967.

Total

Revenue

The estimated revenue for the current financial year 1967/68, inclusive of a receipt of Rs. 118.0 million from measures proposed in the budget was Rs. 2,049.9 million. This, compared with the actual (provisional) revenue of Rs. 1,954.7 mil­lion in 1966/67, shows an increase of Rs. 95.2 million in the Budget estimate of revenue for the current financial year.

The increase in the Estimates of Rs. 95.2 million over the actual revenue collec­tions of the previous year was mainly on account of higher revenues anticipated from excise duties (Rs. 30.5 million), licences etc. (Rs. 65.4 million), postal and telecommunication receipts (Rs. 11.4 million), interest, annuities and dividends, (Rs. 10.1 million), miscellaneous receipts (Rs. 37.3 million), offset in part by decreases in revenue receipts from custom duties (Rs 21.2 million), port and harbour dues (Rs. 3.9 million) and income tax etc. (Rs. 36.3 million).

Tax Proposals and other measures

The new tax proposals and other measures included in the Budget were expected to result in an increase of revenue by Rs. 118 million, and an increase of expendi­ture by Rs. 60 million.

3. Speedier recovery of income tax arrears

An additional revenue of Rs. 15 million was expected through speedier re­covery of income tax arrears. For this purpose the collection machinary of the Inland Revenue Department was to be strengthened.

4. Use of reserves and profits of State Corporations and Undertakings

Government expected to utilise a sum of Rs. 30 million from the reserves and profits of State Corporations and Undertakings. Of this sum, Rs. 8 million^) was to accrue to Government revenue, and the balance of Rs. 22 million was to be made available for financing the Budget deficit.

5. Business turnover tax

Representations had been made regarding hardship caused by the imposition of the business turnover tax on certain small industries like tea chests, cigars, ayur­vedic drugs, joss sticks, driedfish, bricks etc. In these industries, production is mainly by manual labour and no machinery of any consequence is being used. With a wiew to alleviating hardship, it was proposed to reduce the rate of tax from the existing 5 per cent, to 1 per cent. The consequent revenue loss was estimated to be negligible.

6. Interim allowances to Government and Local Government employees and pen­sioners

With a view to affording some relief to the lower paid categories of public offi­cers and Local Government employees, Government decided to pay an interim allowance, pending on overall review of salaries in the public service by a Commission. Those whose salaries did not exceed Rs. 100 per month were to receive an interim allowance of Rs. 20 per month. Those employees whose salaries ex­ceeded Rs. 100 per month but did not exceed Rs. 300 per month, were to receive an allowance of Rs. 10 per month. Pensioners including widows getting a pension not exceeding Rs. 100 per month were to receive an additional allowance of Rs. 10 per month. Those who received pensions above Rs. 100 per month but not exceeding Rs. 300 per month, were entitled to Rs. 5 per month. It was ex­pected that these measures would involve an additional expenditure of Rs. 60 mil­lion an year(a).

Expenditure

The total voted expenditure for 1967/68(3) was estimated at Rs. 2,861.7 million. Of the total, recurrent expenditure (votes 1, 2, 4 & 6) accounted for Rs. 2,079.2 mil­lion, while expenditure chargeable to capital votes (votes 3, 5 and 7) was Rs. 782.5 million. When the usual provision for a 2\ per cent under-expenditure in respect of recurrent expenditure, and 15 per cent under-expenditure for capital votes was made, total voted expenditure was expected to be Rs. 2,692.4 million. This figure was Rs. 172.4 million more than the actual (provisional) voted expenditure^) of Rs. 2,520.0 million for 1966/67, and represented an increase of Rs. 132.0 million in recurrent expenditure and Rs. 40.4 million in capital expenditure.

(1) Classified under Head 10, sub-head 3 and Head 11, sub-head 14 of the revenue Estimates.

(2) These measures were implemented with effect from October, 1967.

(3) Exclusive of sinking fund contributions and direct repayments of public debt from revenue

( 123 )

Current Expenditure

Total recurrent expenditure in the current financial year was estimated at Rs. 2,204.8 million. When capital items under recurrent expenditure, the provision for a 2\ per cent under-expenditure and the provision for sinking fund contributions were deducted from this figure, the resultant current expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,947.6 million, as against an actual (provisional) outlay of Rs. 1,818.5 million in 1966/67.

The increase in estimated current expenditure in 1967/68 (Rs. 181.0 million) as compared with the actual (provisional) expenditure in 1966/67 was mainly on account of increases in expenditure on administration (Rs. 30.4 million), pensions (Rs. 18.4 million), net food subsidy (Rs. 24.5 million), economic services (Rs. 29.6 million), interest on public debt (Rs. 16.0 million) and social services (Rs. 52.5 million).

Capital Expenditure

The provision o f Rs. 782.5 million for expenditure chargeable to capital votes in the estimate for 1967/68, (26 per cent, of total voted expenditure), is the highest provided in any year, and is higher than the provision made in the original estimates for 1966/67 by Rs. 20.8 million. Even after allowing for an under-expenditure of 15 per cent. (Rs. 117.4 million) the level of capital expenditure expected is higher than the actual (provisional) expenditure of 1966/67 by Rs. 40.4 million. When capital items under recurrent expenditure votes are added and a provision for under-expenditure is made, total estimated capital expenditure amounts to Rs. 744.8 mil­lion. This represents an increase of Rs. 43.3 million over the actual (provisional) expenditure (Rs. 701.5 million) for 1966/67.

Other measures proposed in the Budget

(1) Agriculture

A new scheme o f rural credit was finalised and was to be inaugurated from the 1967/68 Maha season. Under this scheme, commercial banks were to take over from the Department o f Agrarian Services, the function of granting loans to Co-operative Societies for the purpose of cultivation of approved crops mainly paddy. The Central Bank would provide the required refinance to enable the com­mercial banks to lend to Co-operative Societies. In view of the risks involved in lending to small farmers for the cultivation of these crops, the Government was to guarantee such loans granted by commercial banks. The Central Bank, on behalf of the Government was to guarantee these loans up to 75 per cent of the amount in default, while the lending banks were to bear the balance 25 per cent. The amount of credit to be issued per acre was increased from Rs. 175 to Rs. 220. It was anti­cipated that the total amount of credit to be granted under the new scheme would increase considerably from its present annual level of about Rs. 33 million.

(2) Industry

It was proposed to introduce new legislation for the encouragement, promotion and development of industries in the private sector. The Industrial Development Board was to be reconstituted within the frame-work of this legislation to undertake further responsibilities in the field of industrial promotion. This organisation was to set up new agencies such as an Investment Information Centre, an Export Pro­motion Centre, an Industrial Supplies Agency and a Management, Development and Productivity Centre. It was also proposed to set up industrial estates in the districts of Galle, Kandy and Jaffna. Statutory provision was also to be made for the setting up of an Industrial Advisory Council, and Industrial Panels for various sectors of industry. The proposed legislation also contemplated the establishment of a special Industrial Development Fund, to which, both the Government and the Manufacturing Industries were to make their contributions.

( 124 )

(3) Re-organisation of credit and savings institutions

(a) The two previous Budget Speeches had announced the Government's intention of repealing restrictions imposed on foreign banks by the Finance

Act of 19610).

(Z>) In accordance with the recommendations of the People's Bank Commis­

sion, legislation was to be presented early in order to transfer the Debt

Redemption Scheme from the People's Bank to the State Mortgage Bank.

(c) Legislation was to be presented to amalgamate the Post Office Savings Bank, the Ceylon Savings Bank and the National Savings Movement, into a National Savings Bank.

(d) Amendments to the State Mortgage Bank Act and the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation Act, with a view to broadening the scope

of activities of these institutions, were being prepared and would be pre­sented to Parliament in the near future.

(e) The People's Bank Act was to be amended in accordance with the recom­mendations of the People's Bank Commission.

( / ) A Commission was to be appointed to inquire into the activities of the Bank of Ceylon and make recommendations designed to make the insti­tution contribute more to the country's economic development^).

(4) Implementation of the recommendations of the Tax Commission

The Taxation Commission which was appointed to make a detailed study of the tax structure and make recommendations, had submitted its report. The recommendations were being studied.

0 ) A bill has since been placed before Parliament.

(2) A Commission of Inquiry has since been appointed for the following puiposes :—

" ( 1 ) to inquire into and report on the working and administration, during the period commencing on the twenty-seventh day of July, 1961, and ending on the twenty-ninth day of February, 1968, of the Bank of Ceylon (hereinafter referred to as the " Bank " ) with special reference to the following matters :—

(a) the'extent to which the Bank has, within the limits permitted by tanking practice and the statutory provisions under which it Operates, assisted in the economic development of Ceylon and the extent to which the Bank has provided financial assistance, by way of loans, overdrafts or other accommodation, to citizens of Ceylon, for the promotion of business, industrial and agricultural enterprises; (b) whether the Bank has granted any loan, overdraft or other accommodation to any person or institution, without adequate security or adequate safeguards or contrary to accepted principles of banking practice ; (c) whether any member of the Board of Directors of the Bank or any officer or employee thereof has directly or indirectly acted in any manner prejudicial to the interests of the Bank ; and (2) to make such recommendations as the Commissioners may consider necessary in regard to the aforesaid matters and in regard to any other matter connected with, or inci­dental to, the aforesaid matters in respect of which trey may receive representations, and, in particular, in regard to the steps that should be taken to secure the efficient and smooth working of the Bank so as to enable the Bank adequately to meet the credit requirements of Ceylon nationals and to play a more effective role in accelerat­ing the economic development of Ceylon."

( 125 )

(5) The Public Service

(a) In order to ensure the maximum utilization of the large sums of money which have been provided for capital and recurrent expenditure it was decided to recruit an additional staff of about 5,400 next year at a cost of over Rs. 15 million. Most of this staff was to be distributed among the Ministries of Education, Agriculture, and Posts and Telecommuni­cations.

(b) In order to improve progressively the standards of Government accoun­ting and to streamline financial procedures, greater emphasis was to be placed on management accounting. The Treasury has initiated a special diploma course in accounting for officers in the Government Accountants' Service in collaboration with the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Action has been taken to afford facilities for promising young officers in the public service to be trained as Chartered Accountants. Both these schemes would result in Government having a corps of qualified accoun­tants to scrutinize closely the vast investments by the Government.

(c) In the last Budget Speech reference was made to the appointment of seve­ral committees ro examine and report on the Ceylon Administrative Service, the establishment of unified engineering and scientific services, and the general question of administrative reforms. All these commit­tees have completed their assignments and the recommendations in res­pect of the Administrative Service and general administrative reforms have already been implemented, while the question of setting up unified services for engineering and scientific personnel was receiving active consideration.

Note on the Fiscal Measures taken after Devaluation

On November 22, 1967 the Government of Ceylon altered the par value of the Ceylon rupee by 20 per cent under section 69 (2) of the Monetary Law Act(i).

With a view to softening the impact of higher prices on the cost of living the Government decided to adopt the following measures simultaneously with the de­valuation of the rupee.

(1) The weekly measure of rice distributed on the ration would continue to be given free, despite the fact that the devaluation itself would increase the rupee price paid by the Government for its rice imports.

(2) The increase in the rupee cost of dhall imported by the Government is to be absorbed by the Government and not passed on to the consumer.

(3) As a measure of further encouragement to increasing Ceylon's domestic production of paddy, which in turn reduces Ceylon's import of rice, the guaranteed price of paddy was increased by Rs. 2, i.e. from Rs. 12 to Rs. 14 per bushel, with effect from 1st December, 1967(2).

(2) Gsvernment Gazette No. 14776/5 of November 25, 1967.

( 1 2 6 )

(4) With the objective of providing relief to lower paid categories of public servants and Local Government employees, the Government decided to pay with effect from 1st December, 1967 a further interim allowance of Rs. 15 per month to all public servants and local Government employees whose basic salary is Rs. 300 and below, and an allowance of Rs. 10 per month for pensioners whose pension does not exceed Rs. 300. This allowance was in addition to the interim allowance varying from Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 per month granted by the Government in the current Budget.

Revenue Measures

With a view of securing a part of additional incomes accruing to exporters, as a result of the devaluation, appropriate adjustments in export duties were adopted, as noted below. In adjusting these duties, consideration was given to prevailing and prospective prices and costs of production of different export commodities, so that there would be an equitable distribution of the additional incomes.

(a) The export duty on tea was increased by 5 cents, to 40 cents per lb (J ) . The Tea Export Duty Rebate Scheme which was expected to cost the Government Rs. 45 million in the financial year 1967/68 was withdrawn(2).

(b) A new export duty of 3 cents per lb. was imposed on rubber in addition to the present sliding scale(3).

(c) The sliding scale of export duty on coconut products was revised to sip­hon off approximately 50 per cent, of the increased prices accruing on cocount products(4).

(d) Export duties on cocoa and cinnamon quills were increased by Rs. 25, to Rs. 30 per 100 lbs. in the case of cocoa, and by 35 cents to 50 cents per lb. in the case of cinnamon quills(4).

In order to meet part of the increase in the landed cost of certain items, the follo­wing measures were also introduced :

(a) An increase in the retail price of white sugar by 5 cents per lb(5).

(b) An increase in the retail price of flour by 5 cents per lb(6).

(c) An increase in the prices of certain petroleum products with effect from November 23, 1967.(')

The increases in the recurrent and capital expenditure of the Government re­sulting from the devaluation and the measures taken at the time may be somewhat higher than the increases in revenue. As a result, the Budget deficit may increase beyond the figure of Rs. 768.1 million originally estimated for the current financial year.

(1) Government Gazette No. 14775/17 of 22nd November, 1967. (2) Commencing January 2,1968, the Government reintroduced a modified scheme of tea rebate, under which 5 cents is paid on each lb; of low and medium grown tea sold at the Colombo

Tea Auctions.
