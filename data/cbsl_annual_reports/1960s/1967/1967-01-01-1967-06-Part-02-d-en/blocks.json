In fact, up to the month of September there was no indication of any expansion of credit, except in the months of February and March when abnormal conditions obtained due to the strike of bank employees. The credit expansion of these two months was almost completely reversed in the five subsequent months.

The new scheme of agricultural credit by commercial banks and the connected scheme of refinance facilities by the Central Bank were directed towards this end.

This meant that the farmer had to await the rains before he made his application. As a result, credit was not made available to him in time for the preparation of land, and even for the purchase of the required fertilizer. He was therefore compelled to resort to non-institutional sources for temporary accommodation. Under the new scheme, aplications are submitted well in advance of the cultivation season, on the assumption that all arable land owned by each farmer would come under the plough. Subsequently, these applications are revised in the light of the pre\u00advailing rainfall conditions, and the amounts scaled down where necessary. Since applications are made well in advance of the cultivation season, the commercial banks have adequate time to process the applications and thereby avoid delays in releasing loans.",

    "text": "On the basis of these revised credit limits, loans totalling Rs. 81.4 million were approved by the People's Bank 1 up to the end of December 1967. Of this sum, however, only Rs. 44.4 million has been utilised by the Cooperative Societies as at 31st December, 1967. Under the old scheme administered by the Department of Agrarian Services, the highest amount granted in loans in any one year was Rs. 34.6 million in the financial year 1963/64. It seems unlikely that the full sum sanctioned of Rs. 81.4 million would be utilised fo the Maha season 1967/68. On the basis of the credit limits fixed for each purpose, almost 90 per cent of each loan is given for purposes connected with cultivation, seed, the use of ferti\u00adlizer and manual or chemical weeding. Funds fo r these purposes should have been given to the farmers with the first two instalments. The balance is for harvesting which would take place somewhat later than the other operations and is covered by the third instalment of each loan. Hence, it would appear that a very high proportion of the loans sanctioned should have been drawn by the end of December, 1967, since by then the initial processes including the use of fertilizer would have been completed in most areas. The total amount utilised at that date was, however, only 54.5 per cent of the total volume of loans sanctioned. It is difficult to explain without proper investigation, the comparatively low proportion of loans drawn to loans sanctioned. It is very clear however, that the volume of credit made available for the cultivation of paddy has been greatly expanded under the new Agricultural Credit Scheme. The total volume of loans released for the Maha season of Rs. 44.4 million, in the three months up to the end of December 1967, is more than the previous peak volume of loans amounting to Rs. 34.6 million granted for a whole year in 1963/64 which included both seasons. The recoveries of the loans given under the new scheme are expected from February 1968 on\u00adwards with the commencement of the Maha harvest.",

The total of refinance loans granted under this scheme in 1967 amounted to Rs. 4.2 million as compared to Rs. 2.6 million in 1966. Allowing for repayments, the amount outstanding at the end of 1967 was Rs. 4.9 million. Only Rs. 0.2 million of these refinance loans were obtained by commercial banks; these were entirely in respect of loans granted by the commercial banks to the private sector for tea factory development. Other credit institutions obtained refinance loans amounting to Rs. 4.7 million in respect of loans granted by them to the private sector for indus\u00adtrial purposes.",
