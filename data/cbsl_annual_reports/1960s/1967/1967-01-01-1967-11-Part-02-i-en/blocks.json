This consideration has particular relevance to Government imports, and more particularly to imports of rice, flour and sugar, which account for a considerable proportion of aggregate imports. The extent of the difference between actual imports of these three commodities and their imports as reflected in the customs recorded data is dis\u00adcussed at some length in the paragraphs that follow.",

The effect on export value of a fall in price was strengthened by a contraction of 7 million pounds or 2 per cent in the volume of rubber exports. The volume of rubber exports in 1967 was 291 million pounds.1 The share of rubber in total export earnings fell to 17 per cent from 20 per cent a year earlier.",

While the average f.o.b. price of bristle fibre declined by 6 per cent, that of mattress fibre increased marginally. The value of exports of cinnamon at Rs. 31 million showed an increase of Rs. 1 million or 3 per cent, which was wholly the result of an increase of 12 per cent in export volume, while the ave\u00adrage f.o.b. price declined by 9 per cent. Export earnings from cocoa at Rs. 4 mill-lion recorded a fall of Rs. 2 million or 33 per cent over the preceding year. This decline was due largely to the result of a fall of 46 per cent in the volume of exports, the effect of which was partly offset by a rise of 28 per cent in average f.o.b. price. Export receipts from natural graphite at Rs. 7 million showed an increase of Rs. 1 million or 17 per cent and was partly due to an increase of 4 per cent in export volume and a rise of 5 per cent in average f.o.b. price. The value of re-exports which had been declining in the two preceding years increased in 1967. At Rs. 59 million, the value of re-exports showed a significant increase of Rs. 35 million over the previous year. This increase was due mainly to an expansion in re-exports of bunkers, which increased by Rs. 32 million.",

    "text": "In 1967 tea production amounted to 487 million pounds. This was 3.4 mil\u00adlion lbs. or about 1 per cent lower than the quantity produced in 1966. When compared with the record figure of 503 million lbs. of tea produced in 1965, however, the quantity of tea produced in 1967 was lower by 16 million lbs. or 3 per cent. The lower level of production in 1967 was due partly to adverse weather conditions experienced during the early months of the year and partly to an orientation of pro\u00adduction to quality manufacture. Finer plucking was resorted to as a means to im\u00adproving quality in order to realise better prices particularly in the high and medium high-grown categories. The shift to quality manufacture did not, however, arrest the decline in producer prices. A further contributory factor leading to a reduction in overall production has been the effect of lower producer prices on marginal out\u00adput. Although this observation cannot be firmly established, it is very likely that the effect of persistently lower prices on low-grown estates in particular has been towards inducing a contraction in output. The decline in output was confined to high and low grown teas, whose output fell by 9.0 million lbs. and 6.6 million lbs. respectively. Production of medium-grown teas, however, increased by 12.1 mil\u00adlion lbs. Table II (I) 3 provides data in respect of production, exports, the volume offered at the Colombo Auctions and the volume shipped direct to the U.K. to the London Auctions as well as volume of sales under private treaty.",

    "text": "The decline in the prices of tea, which began in early 1966 continued through\u00adout that year and gained momentum during the second quarter of 1967. During the third quarter low-grown teas continued to decline while high and medium grown teas registered slight increases. The fourth quarter, however, saw substantial in\u00adcreases in the prices of all three elevational categories of teas. This increase in mar\u00adket prices can be attributed partly to the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee on 22nd November, 1967. The average nett price of all teas sold at the Colombo Auctions, which had declined by as much as 18 cts. per lb. or 10 per cent in 1966, registeted a further decline of 7 cents per lb. or 4 per cent to Rs. 1.50 per pound in 1967. This decline in price was confined^to high and low grown categories of teas, while medium grown teas registered a marginal increase of 1 cent per pound. In regard to high and low grown categories, there were marked differences in the degree of price declines. The average nett price of low grown teas at Rs. 1.20 per lb. registered a sharp fall of 17 cents per lb. or 12 per cent below the 1966 level, while that of high grown teas declined by 2 cents per pound or 1 per cent to Rs. 1.82 per lb. Table II (I) 4 gives data on production, exports and prices of tea.",

This decline in prices was in the main due to restricted purchases from the Middle Eastern buyers, particularly Iraq. The Iraqi Government Purchasing Board withdrew from the Colombo market in mid-February and re-entered it only in May.1 The withdrawal of Iraq from the tea market resulted in a limited demand for low growns and market prices reached a low level of 90 cents per lb. It may also be noted that the low prices which prevailed in the market resulted in heavy withdrawals of tea catalogue dfcr sale. Although prices improved during the third quarter, yet they were 7 cents per lb. lower than that of the corresponding quarter",

This scheme provided for tea which fetched a gross price under Rs. 1.50 per lb. at the Colombo Auctions to be paid a rebate amounting to the difference between Rs. 1.50 and the price realised at the auctions, subject to a maximum of 35 cents per lb. With a view to discouraging the production of inferior quality teas, the rebate was not paid in respect of teas which realised a price less than 90 cents per lb. T o allow time for the small-holders to improve the quality of their tea, the lower limit below which no rebate was to be paid was fixed at 70 cents per lb. for the first four weeks and 80 cents per lb. for the next four weeks. At the end of this period, it was raised to 90 cents per lb. Although the lower limit should have been raised to Re. 1/- per lb. with effect from the sale of 13th/14th March, 1967, the Government postponed implementing this decision until September in view of the hardships caused to producers whose tea prices fell in the range of 90 - 99 cents inclusive.",

    "text": "An examination of average annual London market prices reveals that the downward drift in auction values at the London market was arrested in 1967. The average price of all teas sold at this centre at 4 sh. 1.81 d. per pound showed an increase of 0.95 d. This increase in price contrasts with a fall of 1.31 d. per pound recorded in the previous year and 1.28 d. per pound in 1965. There were marked fluctuations in the price of tea during the first half of the year and the average price of all teas sold at this centre during the first half of 1967 at 3 sh. 11.13 d. per pound registered a drop of 1.16 d. per pound below that of the corresponding period of last year. The overall decline in price during this period may be attributed largely to the plainness in the quality of teas that were offered, particularly in respect of North Indian teas, which accounted for the greater percentage of teas sold at these auctions. Although the market reaches its customary low level in June-July tea prices in 1967 continued to be low during August. The latter phenomenon has to be accounted for by the delayed arrival of the new season's crop from North India, caused by the closure of the Suez Canal in June and the consequent longer route via the Cape of G o o d Hope. In September, with the arrival of the new season's crop, market prices registered sharp increases. This upward trend was continued in the three months following when better quality Ceylon teas, too, were on sale. Unofficial strikes in the U.K. Ports (Liverpool and London) which began in Sep\u00adtember and which continued during October helped to sustain price improvements. The strike compelled shipping companies to divert vessels scheduled to discharge at strike bound ports to the continent and such diversions account for the reduced quantities offered at London. Although the strike ended in the latter part of Oc\u00adtober, quantities coming forward were low due to delayed arrivals of tea shipments consequent to the longer route via the Cape and the alteration in the system of printing of catalogues where warehouse weights replaced garden weights. All these factors resulted in market prices remaining high during November and December.",

In 1966 and 1965, however, the average Lon\u00addon Market price for Ceylon teas had dropped by 0.27 d. per pound and 2.70 d. per pound respectively. The increase of 1.45 d. in the average price of Ceylon tea in 1967 was accompanied by increases in the average prices of North Indian and South Indian teas. The average price of North Indian teas at 4 sh. 5.71 d. per pound registered an increase of 1.57 d. per pound over the average price realised in 1966, while the price of South Indian teas at 3 sh. 6.48 d. per pound recorded an increase of 1.44 d. per pound. The prices of tea from all other producing ter\u00adritories, with the exception of Malawi, Argentine and Vietnam recorded increases. The decline in the prices registered by the above three countries was due probably to the quality of teas offered being inferior. Reduced availability of plain teas at this centre, particularly during the latter months of the year gave a fillip to teas from other producing countries viz, African territories, Mauritius and Malaya.",

In May and June 1967, however, stocks were at a higher level than in the corresponding months of 1965 and 1966. Throughout the second half of the year, tea stocks in the U.K. were noticeably lower than in the corresponding periods of 1966 and 1965. This running down of stocks was due to the high afloats position caused by the delayed arrivals of tea.

Among the factors which contributed to the improvements in prices were, low exports from Philippines owing to a short-fall in production, curtailed shipments of Palm kernel and Palm oil from Nigeria due to political unrest, and disruption of the movements of shipments due to the closure of the Suez Canal. In the World market improvements in the prices of copra and coconut oil during the first half of 1967 were not pronounced and price levels were lower than their corresponding prices in 1966. A marked improvement in prices for coconut products was noticed during the second half of 1967 after the closure of the Suez Canal when prices moved substantially higher than the corresponding prices in 1966.",

The volume of imports of rice in 1967 was lower than that imported in 1966 due largely to the steps taken by Government on the food subsidy front which included besides re\u00adducing by one measure the subsidised weekly ration o f rice issued to the consumers, policies aimed at increasing local rice production. The sharp increase in the average c. and f. price of rice was in keeping with the trend of prices in the world markets and was the result of poor harvests and consequent shortages.",

The average c. and f. price at Rs. 453 per ton registered a fall of Rs. 6 per ton or one per cent below the average price in 1966. The increased imports of flour in the year under review was in order to meet an anticipated increase in demand for flour following on the reduction in the subsidised weekly ration of rice in December 1966. While actual consumption of flour increased during 1967, the enhanced im\u00adports were sufficient not only to meet the increase in consumption but also to build up stocks which increased during the year by about 76,300 tons.1",

    "text": "The large fall in the value of imports of 'consumer goods' is accounted for large\u00adly by reduced imports of 'food and drink' items. These imports at Rs. 783 million have declined by Rs. 173 million or 18 per cent below the 1966 level, due mainly to Customs entries relating to government imports of rice, flour and sugar decli\u00adning in the aggregate by Rs. 69 million or 12 per cent. The changes in actual im\u00adports of these commodities, however, differed from the Customs entries and are set out in the subsequent paragraphs. Imports of 'milk and milk products' at Rs. 66 million have fallen by Rs. 11 million or 14 per cent below the level reached in 1966, while imports of 'meat and fish' have declined by Rs. 45 million or 45 per cent to Rs. 56 million in 1967. With regard to imports of 'food other' (which includes potatoes, grams, pulses and curry stuffs) the value of imports have at Rs. 126 million recorded a fall of Rs. 44 million or 26 per cent. In this sub-group a part of the decline in the value of imports resulted from the ban on imports of potatoes intro\u00adduced during May 1967. Imports of dried chillies too were reduced. These mea\u00adsures were adopted with a view to encouraging the local production of these items. The reduction in the value of imports of pulses during 1967 as compared with 1966 could be attributed to their reduced availabilty in the world markets following bad crops in Syria.",

The decline of Rs. 25.0 million or 30 per cent in the value of exports to the U.S.S.R. was due to declines in exports of all principal commodities. Exports of rubber, which constituted the major export for the year declined by Rs. 7.3 million or 23 per cent to Rs. 24.0 million in 1967, while exports of tea at Rs. 14.2 million fell by Rs. 7.4 million or 34 per cent. Exports of coconut oil, which had expanded sharply in 1966 registered a fall of Rs. 7.8 million or 35 per cent during the year under review. Exports of copra too declined by Rs. 1.7 million or 36 per cent below the preceding year. Exports to Poland, which amounted to Rs. 12.5 million or 12 per cent of total exports to the region, declined sharply by Rs. 12.3 million or 50 per cent below the level of exports in 1966. As in the previous years, rubber was the principal export, accounting for Rs. 6.8 million and registering a decline of Rs. 12.9 million or 65 per cent below 1966. Exports of coconut oil at Rs. 1.3 million also declined by Rs. 2.3 million or 64 per cent. Exports of tea, which amoun\u00adted to Rs. 1.0 million in 1966 increased to Rs. 3.1 million during the year under review. This increase in the value of tea exports to Poland was largely the result of the barter agreement which provided for the exchange of 1,000 tons of tea valued at \u00a3 300,000 for textiles of an equivalent value. Exports to Rumania, which had amounted to Rs. 18.0 million in 1966, increased slightly by Rs. 0.7 million or 4 per cent to Rs. 18.7 million in 1967 and accounted for 18 per cent of total exports to the region. This increase in export value was largely the result of an increase in exports of rubber by Rs. 1.7 million or 12 per cent to Rs. 16.4 million, the effect of which was partly offset by reductions in the value of exports of cocoa and coconut oil.",

These imports accounted for 67 per cent of total imports from the region.

Imports of petroleum products from the region, as a whole, amounted to Rs. 56.2 million or 50 per cent of total imports of these products from all sources. Imports of sugar from the U.S.S.R. at Rs. 37.2 million, in 1967 increased sharply by Rs. 27.9 million over the previous year.

Sugar was the major import from Poland, representing around 36 per cent of total imports from that country. Sugar was also the principal import from Bulgaria. Total imports from Bulgaria amounted to Rs. 3.8 million. Sugar imports from the region amounted to Rs. 43.3 million and represented 60 per cent of total sugar imports from all sources. Imports from Czechoslovakia amounted to Rs. 9.4 million, a decline of Rs. 6.2 million or 40 per cent. Imports from Czechoslovakia with the exception of condensed milk registered declines. Imports of condensed milk, however, registered an increase of Rs. 0.7 million to Rs. 1.2 million in 1967. Imports from Rumania, which had increased by Rs. 15.6 million in 1966, declined sharply by Rs. 14.2 million or 50 per cent to Rs. 14.1 million in 1967. This decline was largely the result of a fall of Rs. 5,0 mil\u00adlion or 78 per cent in imports of cement. Imports of cement from the region as a whole amounted to Rs. 4.5 million or 82 per cent of imports of this commodity from all sources. Imports from the German Democratic Republic at Rs. 5.2 mil\u00adlion showed no change over the previous year. The sharp increase of Rs. 5.2 mil\u00adlion in the value of imports from Yugoslavia which in 1967 amounted to Rs. 7.8 million was due mainly to increased imports of non-electrical machinery, the value of which in 1967 expanded by Rs. 4.0 million. Imports from Hungary at Rs. 3.4 million registered an increase of Rs. 2.1 million over the preceding year.",

The imports of potatoes were completely banned with effect from end of May 1967. The reduc\u00adtions in the allocations for chillies, Bombay onions and potatoes were intended to provide a fillip to local production during 1967. The reduction in the allocation for textiles from Rs.124 million in 1966 to Rs. 65 million in 1967 was effected after taking into consideration the presence of large stocks (48 million yards) ashore and afloat at the end of 1966 and in the light of the increased supply from domestic production. In the case of other trade quota items, which includes a host of items, reductions were mainly effected on consumer items on the basis of possible increase in domestic production and on the criteria of \"non-essentiality\" or low priority.",
