(I) FOREIGN TRADE

Overall Trends

During the year 1967, the value of exports inclusive of re-exports was Rs. 1,690 million and that of imports Rs. 1,738 million, 1 resulting in a merchandise trade deficit o f Rs. 48 million.

Export earnings which had shown a steady improvement from the low level reached in 1963 declined sharply by Rs. 249 million in 1966. In the year 1967, the value of Ceylon's exports amounted to Rs. 1,690 million, registering a further decline of Rs. 10 million or 0.6 per cent below the 1966 level and was the lowest figure recorded since 1957.

The value of imports, which during 1966 had shown a sharp expansion o f Rs. 554 million or 38 per cent over 1965, fell substantially in 1967 and at Rs. 1,738 million declined by Rs. 290 million or 14 per cent below the previous year.

(1) The figure of aggregate imports needs to be interpreted with caution. As pointed out in the Annual Reports for 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966, there could be considerable differences between the value of imports actually received and cleared from the Customs in any time pe­riod and their value as reflected in the Customs entries, from which Customs data are derived, if there was a significant interval between the clearance of imports and the passing of the relative Customs entries. This consideration has particular relevance to Government imports, and more particularly to imports of rice, flour and sugar, which account for a considerable proportion of aggregate imports. The extent of the difference between actual imports of these three commodities and their imports as reflected in the customs recorded data is dis­cussed at some length in the paragraphs that follow.

( 1 4 6 )

The total volume of exports, which had received a serious setback in 1966 ex­panded during the year 1967, the Central Bank's index of export volumes at 119 (Base 1958 = 100), showing an increase of 4 per cent over the preceding year. The average price of all exports which had shown a slight improvement during the year 1965 registered a fall of 5 per cent in 1966. During the year 1967, this falling trend was continued and the average price index of all exports declined by a further 6 per cent below the 1966 level. Thus, the shortfall in export earnings during the year 1967 was the result of a fall in the average price of all exports, the effect of which was partly offset by an increase in volume exported.

The volume of imports (as measured by the Central Bank Trade Indices, Base 1958=100) during the year 1965 was relatively low when compared with the pre­ceding years. The year 1966, however, witnessed a sharp increase in total volume of imports, which tendency has been reversed during the year 1967. The aggregate volume index of imports (base 1958= 100) at 85 indicated a fall of 21 per cent below 1966. The average price of all imports which had been rising steadily since 1962, continued its upward trend during 1967 and the Central Bank's index of all import prices at 123 indicated an increase of 3 per cent over the previous year. The sharp decline in the value of imports in 1967 is, therefore, largely the result of a marked contraction in the volume of imports, the effect of which more than offset an increase in their average price.

Ceylon's commodity terms of trade (as measured by the Central Bank Trade Indices) which had been deteriorating since 1962 registered a slight improvement in 1965. This temporary phenomenon was reversed in 1966 when the terms of trade declined shaip'y by 13 per cent. The terms of trade continued to be adverse during the year 1967, deteriorating from 76 (1966) to 69 (1967) i.e. by a further 9 per cent below the preceding year's level.

The purchasing power of exports i.e. Export value index JQQ which had Import price index shown a marked increase during the year 1964 continued to increase in 1965. This tendency, however, was reversed in 1966, when the purchasing power of exports fell by 20 per cent. This trend continued into 1967 when the index fell by a further 6 per cent below the 1966 level.

The figure of total imports as recorded in the Customs Returns understates the value of imports actually received during 1967. While in 1966, the Customs records of imports of rice, flour and sugar, over-stated the Food Commissioner's actual imports of these commodities by Rs. 121 million, in 1967 they understated the Food Commissioner's imports of these commodities by Rs. 35 million.

If the total imports for 1966 and 1967, as recorded in the Customs data are adjusted to jeflect the. actual imports received by the Food Commissioner, the va­lue of total imports in 1966 would be reduced to Rs. 1,907 million from Rs. 2,028 million and in 1967, it would be increased to Rs. 1,773 million from Rs. 1,738 million. On this basis, the value o f imports in 1967 fell short of the previous year's level by Rs. 134 million or 7 per cent.

The balance of trade, as reflected in the Customs data recorded a deficit of Rs. 48 million in 1967 as against a deficit of Rs. 328 million in 1966.1 On the basis of adjusted data the deficit in merchandise trade balance for 1966 will be reduced to Rs. 207 million, while the deficit for 1967 will be increased to Rs. 83 million.

Exports

( H 7 )

The decline in export earnings of Rs. 10 million in 1967 was largely due to a decline of Rs. 55 million in export earnings from rubber and Rs. 29 million from the three major coconut products, the effects of which were partly offset by an in­crease of Rs. 74 million in export earnings from tea, minor export products and re-exports. Table II (I) 2 gives the composition of exports and their relative percentage shares in the total of export earnings. The decline in the total value of exports was entirely the result of sharp declines in the average f.o.b. prices of all three major export products.

Export earnings from tea increased by Rs. 34 million or 3 per cent in 1967 as compared with 1966. The increase in earnings was wholly due to an expansion in the volume exported. The volume of tea exports in 1967 at 478 million pounds was 37 million pounds or 8 per cent higher than the quantity exported in 1966.

X The average f.o.b price of tea which had registered a sharp decline in the preceding year, recorded a further decline and at Rs. 2.22 per pound was 11 cents per pound or 5 per cent lower than in 1966. The share of tea in total export earnings at 63 pet cent has shown an increase of 3 per cent over that of the previous year.

Export earnings from rubber, on the other hand, declined by Rs. 55 million or 16 per cent as compared with 1966. This was due largely to a sharp decline in the average f.o.b. price of rubber, which fell by 16 cents per pound to 97 cents per pound in 1967. The effect on export value of a fall in price was strengthened by a contraction of 7 million pounds or 2 per cent in the volume of rubber exports. The volume of rubber exports in 1967 was 291 million pounds.1 The share of rubber in total export earnings fell to 17 per cent from 20 per cent a year earlier.

Export receipts from the three major coconut products fell by Rs. 29 million or 15 per cent below the preceding year. This decline was partly the result of a fall of 8 per cent in their aggregate export volume and partly the result of a fall of 6 per cent in their average price (as measured by the Central Bank Trade Indices). The share of these products in the total export earnings declined to 10 per cent from 12 per cent in 1966.

(1) The total quantities of rubber actually shipped during the twelve months ended December 1967 was 298,945,207 lbs.

( 148 )

Earnings from other domestic exports which had declined by Rs. 11 million or 9 per cent in 1966, increased by Rs. 5 million or 4 per cent in 1967. Exports of coir fibre at Rs. 41 million has shown an increase of Rs. 3 million or 8 per cent due to an increase of 6 per cent in the volume of exports and a rise of 4 per cent in the average f.o.b. price. While the average f.o.b. price of bristle fibre declined by 6 per cent, that of mattress fibre increased marginally. The value of exports of cinnamon at Rs. 31 million showed an increase of Rs. 1 million or 3 per cent, which was wholly the result of an increase of 12 per cent in export volume, while the ave­rage f.o.b. price declined by 9 per cent. Export earnings from cocoa at Rs. 4 mill-lion recorded a fall of Rs. 2 million or 33 per cent over the preceding year. This decline was due largely to the result of a fall of 46 per cent in the volume of exports, the effect of which was partly offset by a rise of 28 per cent in average f.o.b. price. Export receipts from natural graphite at Rs. 7 million showed an increase of Rs. 1 million or 17 per cent and was partly due to an increase of 4 per cent in export volume and a rise of 5 per cent in average f.o.b. price. The value of re-exports which had been declining in the two preceding years increased in 1967. At Rs. 59 million, the value of re-exports showed a significant increase of Rs. 35 million over the previous year. This increase was due mainly to an expansion in re-exports of bunkers, which increased by Rs. 32 million.

Tea

In 1967 tea production amounted to 487 million pounds. This was 3.4 mil­lion lbs. or about 1 per cent lower than the quantity produced in 1966. When compared with the record figure of 503 million lbs. of tea produced in 1965, however, the quantity of tea produced in 1967 was lower by 16 million lbs. or 3 per cent. The lower level of production in 1967 was due partly to adverse weather conditions experienced during the early months of the year and partly to an orientation of pro­duction to quality manufacture. Finer plucking was resorted to as a means to im­proving quality in order to realise better prices particularly in the high and medium high-grown categories. The shift to quality manufacture did not, however, arrest the decline in producer prices. A further contributory factor leading to a reduction in overall production has been the effect of lower producer prices on marginal out­put. Although this observation cannot be firmly established, it is very likely that the effect of persistently lower prices on low-grown estates in particular has been towards inducing a contraction in output. The decline in output was confined to high and low grown teas, whose output fell by 9.0 million lbs. and 6.6 million lbs. respectively. Production of medium-grown teas, however, increased by 12.1 mil­lion lbs. Table II (I) 3 provides data in respect of production, exports, the volume offered at the Colombo Auctions and the volume shipped direct to the U.K. to the London Auctions as well as volume of sales under private treaty.

The volume of tea exported in 1967 increased by 37 million lbs. or 8 per cent over that of 1966. This expansion reflected an increase of 10 million lbs. or 3 per cent in the quantity sold at the Colombo Auctions and 2 million lbs.or 2 per cent in the quantity of tea shipped direct to the U.K. to the London Auctions. Through the medium of private sales 5 million lbs. of tea were sold. Available data indicate that stocks of manufactured tea in Ceylon declined from 59 million lbs. at the end of September 1966 to 40 million lbs. at the end of September 1967.1

The decline in the prices of tea, which began in early 1966 continued through­out that year and gained momentum during the second quarter of 1967. During the third quarter low-grown teas continued to decline while high and medium grown teas registered slight increases. The fourth quarter, however, saw substantial in­creases in the prices of all three elevational categories of teas. This increase in mar­ket prices can be attributed partly to the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee on 22nd November, 1967. The average nett price of all teas sold at the Colombo Auctions, which had declined by as much as 18 cts. per lb. or 10 per cent in 1966, registeted a further decline of 7 cents per lb. or 4 per cent to Rs. 1.50 per pound in 1967. This decline in price was confined^to high and low grown categories of teas, while medium grown teas registered a marginal increase of 1 cent per pound. In regard to high and low grown categories, there were marked differences in the degree of price declines. The average nett price of low grown teas at Rs. 1.20 per lb. registered a sharp fall of 17 cents per lb. or 12 per cent below the 1966 level, while that of high grown teas declined by 2 cents per pound or 1 per cent to Rs. 1.82 per lb. Table II (I) 4 gives data on production, exports and prices of tea.

The larger quantity of tea that reached the Colombo Auctions during 1967-the quantities sold at the Colombo Auctions increased by 10 million lbs. over the previous year's total - and reduced purchases by Iraq and U.S.S.R. were the major factors contributing to the deterioration in market prices.

The average nett price of high growns showed a decline of 15 cents per lb. during tb.3 first quarter of 1967, as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1966. With the close of the Dimbulla/Dickoya season prices on an average during second quarter of 1967, declined by 23 cents per lb. below the preceding quarter and by 4 cents per lb. below the corresponding quarter of 1966 to Rs. 1.66 per lb. High grown tea prices improved during the third quarter of 1967 and at Rs. 1.80 per lb. was a cent per lb. higher than that of the corresponding quarter of the previous year. In the final quarter, however, prices improved further and at Rs. 1.97 per lb. registered an increase of 15 cents per lb. over the same quarter of 1966.

The average price of medium grown teas following the trend of prices of high growns registered declines of almost similar magnitudes during the first two quarters of the year under review. While the average price during the first quarter fell by 15 cents per lb., during the second quarter, it declined by 6 cents per lb. In the third quarter, however, prices improved, the average price rising by 4 cents per lb. over the same quarter of last year. The fourth quarter saw a further improvement in prices with the average price rising by as much as 24 cents per lb. over the corresponding quarter of 1966 to Rs. 1.70 per lb.

Low grown teas fared adversely during the first two quarters of 1967 and their average nett prices at Rs. 1.10 and Rs. 1.04 per lb. respectively, registered declines of 52 cents per lb. and 36 cents per lb. respectively, below the corresponding quarters in 1966. This decline in prices was in the main due to restricted purchases from the Middle Eastern buyers, particularly Iraq. The Iraqi Government Purchasing Board withdrew from the Colombo market in mid-February and re-entered it only in May.1 The withdrawal of Iraq from the tea market resulted in a limited demand for low growns and market prices reached a low level of 90 cents per lb. It may also be noted that the low prices which prevailed in the market resulted in heavy withdrawals of tea catalogue dfcr sale. Although prices improved during the third quarter, yet they were 7 cents per lb. lower than that of the corresponding quarter

(1) Forbes & walker Market Reports for the months February and May, 1967.

( 151 )

of the previous year. In the final quarter, however, prices improved further, the average price at Rs. 1.49 per lb. registering an increase of 34 cents per lb. over the fourth quarter of 1966 and 29 cents per lb. over the third quarter of 1967. This increase in price was largely the result of active competition for these teas from the Middle Eastern buyers following the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee.

The export duty rebate scheme, which was introduced on 25 th September 1966, with a view to rendering immediate relief to tea small-holders who were receiving low prices for their green leaf continued to operate up to 23rd November, 1967. This scheme provided for tea which fetched a gross price under Rs. 1.50 per lb. at the Colombo Auctions to be paid a rebate amounting to the difference between Rs. 1.50 and the price realised at the auctions, subject to a maximum of 35 cents per lb. With a view to discouraging the production of inferior quality teas, the rebate was not paid in respect of teas which realised a price less than 90 cents per lb. T o allow time for the small-holders to improve the quality of their tea, the lower limit below which no rebate was to be paid was fixed at 70 cents per lb. for the first four weeks and 80 cents per lb. for the next four weeks. At the end of this period, it was raised to 90 cents per lb. Although the lower limit should have been raised to Re. 1/- per lb. with effect from the sale of 13th/14th March, 1967, the Government postponed implementing this decision until September in view of the hardships caused to producers whose tea prices fell in the range of 90 - 99 cents inclusive.

As a result of price improvements registered by low grown teas during the third and fourth quarters of the year, the lower limit for the payment of the rebate was raised to Re. 1/- per lb. with effect from 4th September and again to Rs. 1.30 per lb. with effect from 1st November, 1967.

To qualify for this rebate, a factory had to satisfy that it had in 1965, manufac­tured at least 25 per cent of its total production or 100,000 lbs. of made tea from 'bought leaf.

Although this relief scheme was extended to include all estates, with effect from the sale of 29th November 1966, the Government withdrew the export duty rebate given to all high grown teas with effect from 18th April, 1967, with the exception of those manufactured by nine factories purchasing considerable quanti­ties of 'bouhgt l e a f tea. With the devaluation of the Ceylon Rupee on 22nd November, 1967 the export duty rebate scheme was withdrawn altogether with effect from 23rd November, 1967.

Table II (I) 5 gives particulars of the quantities on which the rebate was granted, the total amount paid out as rebate and the average rebate paid per pound. The periods for which data are given are indicated in column (1).

It may be noted that of a total of 335.4 million lbs. of tea sold at the Colombo Auctions in the eleven month period January to November 1967, no less than 143.3 million lbs. or 42.7 per cent qualified for the rebate. The total expenditure in­volved by way of rebates under this scheme during 1967 was Rs. 40.8 million, of which low growns accounted for Rs. 25.3 million or 62.0 per cent and medium growns for Rs. 13.0 million or 31.9 per cent. The average rebate paid on all teas in 1967 was 28 cents per lb. While low grown teas on an average received 29 cents per pound as rebate, medium and high-growns received 27 cents and 26 cents per pound respectively.

During the last three months of 1966 when this scheme was in operation the total expenditure involved was Rs. 5.9 million, of which low-grown teas accounted for Rs. 4.5 million or 76.0 per cent. Thus the total cost to the Government in im­plementing this scheme during the 14 months during which period it was in opera­tion amounted to Rs. 46.7 million. In all 164.0 million lbs. of the tea sold at the Colombo Auctions qualified for the rebate and the average rebate paid during the entire period amounted to 29 cents per lb.

London Auctions1

An examination of average annual London market prices reveals that the downward drift in auction values at the London market was arrested in 1967. The average price of all teas sold at this centre at 4 sh. 1.81 d. per pound showed an increase of 0.95 d. This increase in price contrasts with a fall of 1.31 d. per pound recorded in the previous year and 1.28 d. per pound in 1965. There were marked fluctuations in the price of tea during the first half of the year and the average price of all teas sold at this centre during the first half of 1967 at 3 sh. 11.13 d. per pound registered a drop of 1.16 d. per pound below that of the corresponding period of last year. The overall decline in price during this period may be attributed largely to the plainness in the quality of teas that were offered, particularly in respect of North Indian teas, which accounted for the greater percentage of teas sold at these auctions. Although the market reaches its customary low level in June-July tea prices in 1967 continued to be low during August. The latter phenomenon has to be accounted for by the delayed arrival of the new season's crop from North India, caused by the closure of the Suez Canal in June and the consequent longer route via the Cape of G o o d Hope. In September, with the arrival of the new season's crop, market prices registered sharp increases. This upward trend was continued in the three months following when better quality Ceylon teas, too, were on sale. Unofficial strikes in the U.K. Ports (Liverpool and London) which began in Sep­tember and which continued during October helped to sustain price improvements. The strike compelled shipping companies to divert vessels scheduled to discharge at strike bound ports to the continent and such diversions account for the reduced quantities offered at London. Although the strike ended in the latter part of Oc­tober, quantities coming forward were low due to delayed arrivals of tea shipments consequent to the longer route via the Cape and the alteration in the system of printing of catalogues where warehouse weights replaced garden weights. All these factors resulted in market prices remaining high during November and December.

The average price of all grades of Ceylon tea sold at the Lonndon Auctions during the year amounted to 4 sh. 4.33 d. per pound, registering an increase of 1.45 d. per pound over the preceding year. In 1966 and 1965, however, the average Lon­don Market price for Ceylon teas had dropped by 0.27 d. per pound and 2.70 d. per pound respectively. The increase of 1.45 d. in the average price of Ceylon tea in 1967 was accompanied by increases in the average prices of North Indian and South Indian teas. The average price of North Indian teas at 4 sh. 5.71 d. per pound registered an increase of 1.57 d. per pound over the average price realised in 1966, while the price of South Indian teas at 3 sh. 6.48 d. per pound recorded an increase of 1.44 d. per pound. The prices of tea from all other producing ter­ritories, with the exception of Malawi, Argentine and Vietnam recorded increases. The decline in the prices registered by the above three countries was due probably to the quality of teas offered being inferior. Reduced availability of plain teas at this centre, particularly during the latter months of the year gave a fillip to teas from other producing countries viz, African territories, Mauritius and Malaya.

The total quantity of tea sold at the London Auctions in 1967 amounted to 284 million lbs.1 indicating a fall of 53 million lbs. or 16 per cent below the quan­tity sold in 1966. This decline in volume has been shared by all the major producing countries consigning tea to this centre. While the quantities of North Indian and South Indian teas sold at these auctions during this year at 113 million lbs. and 12 million lbs. respectively, declined by 28 million lbs. and 8 million pounds respecti­vely, quantities from Ceylon and African territories at 96 million lbs. and 56 mil­lion lbs. respectively fell short of the previous year's levels by 11 million lbs. and 2 million pounds respectively.

The level of stocks in U.K. during the first four months of 1967 was lower than during the corresponding months of 1966, but stocks were higher than in the corresponding period of 1965. In May and June 1967, however, stocks were at a higher level than in the corresponding months of 1965 and 1966. Throughout the second half of the year, tea stocks in the U.K. were noticeably lower than in the corresponding periods of 1966 and 1965. This running down of stocks was due to the high afloats position caused by the delayed arrivals of tea. Thus, at the end of the year, these stocks amounted to 135 million pounds2, or 8 million pounds less than at the end of 1966.

A further factor responsible for the rise in the average London market price has been the material improvement in the quality of the second flush teas from North India during the current season, as against the character of the flush of the previous year. This improvement in quality was due largely to favourable growing conditions, particularly the climate.

Available data on world production indicate that during 1967 tea output was 1,547 million lbs.3 revealing an increase of only 6 million lbs. over 1966. This compares with an increase of 44 million lbs. in 1966. North India and Pakistan were the only producers to record increases in production, while the other major tea producing countries recorded declines. The major factor responsible for the decline in production in South India, Ceylon and East Africa was adverse weather, particularly drought. India, as a whole increased its production by 8 million lbs. while Pakistan recorded an increase of 3 million lbs.

Rubber

The production of rubber, which had shown a marked increase of 28 million pounds or 11 per cent in 1966, expanded further by 27 million pounds or 9 per cent to 316 million pounds in 1967. The production of sheet rubber increased by 16.8 million pounds while crepe and latex increased by 9.9 million pounds and 0.3 million pounds respectively. The increase in the output was due to high yields obtained from the replanted areas now coming into bearing. The local consumption of rub­ber which stood at 4.9 million pounds ip. 1966 increased by 1.0 million pounds to 5.9 million pounds in 1967. The volume of rubber exported which rose steeply by 31 million pounds or 12 per cent in 1966, registered a fall of 7 million pounds or 2 per cent to 291 million pounds in 1967.4 The quantity of sheet rubber exported at 163.3 million pounds registered a drop of 16.8 million pounds (or 9.3 per cent), while exports of crepe (all varieties) at 127.4 million pounds registered an increase of 9.2 million pounds (or 8.1 per cent) when compared with 1966.

In the Colombo market the price of R.S.S. No. 1 followed a downward trend in 1967, following the pattern of the price movements in the world centres. The average price of sheet rubber R.S.S. No. 1 in the Colombo market which showed a persistent decline in 1966 continued to decline up to September 1967, when the average market price reached a low of Rs. 0.71 cts. per pound. The average market price showed slight improvements in both October and November. With the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee, market prices picked up and in December 1967 the average price of sheet rubber R.S.S. N o . 1 increased sharply by 11 cts. per pound (or by 15 per cent) over the previous month and by 2 cents per pound (or by 1 per cent) over the average market price in December 1966. The annual average price of R.S.S. N o . 1 in 1967 declined by 10 cts. per pound or 11 per cent to Rs. 0.79 cts. per lb. when compared with the annual average price in 1966.

The decline in the average price of Latex crepe N o . I X which began around August 1966 continued up to October 1967, when it reached Rs. 0.82 cents per pound. The monthly average price for November showed a slight improvement, and after the devaluation of the rupee, the average price in December 1967 recor­ded a noticeable rise of 7 cts per pound (or by 8 per cent) over the preceding month's price; however, when compared with December 1966, this price was 7 cents per pound lower.

In the international markets prices of natural rubber followed a downward trend in 1967. Among the factors which contributed to the decline in the prices of natural rubber were increased availabilities of synthetic rubber at reduced prices, frequent changes in the policy of a stock pile releases in the United States of Ame­rica, labour unrest in the tyre and motor car industry in the United States of Ame­rica, reduced purchases by the manufacturers in Europe and the availability of increased supplies from Indonesia. During January to November 1967 (latest data available)1 the world production of synthetic rubber amounted to 3,092,500 tons as against 3,047,500 tons for the same period in 1966, while consumption for the same period in 1967 accounted for 3,037,500 tons, as against 2,970,000 tons for the

(1) Public Ledger 2nd March, 1968 p.3.

(156)

same period in 1966. The world supply of natural rubber including releases from United States stockpile for the period January to November 1967 totalled 2,315,000 tons against 2,325,000 tons for the same period in 1966, while consumption of na­tural rubber accounted for 2,257,500 tons in the period January to November 1967 as against 2,322,500 tons for the same period in 1966, thus reflecting a drop of 65,000 tons or 2.8 per cent in the consumption in 1967.

In the World trading centres prices of natural rubber declined steadily from the beginning of 1967, with only minor upward movements during the months of May, June and July owing to the Middle East conflict. In the London market the lowest monthly average price of 1 sh. 3££- d. per pound for spot R.S.S. N o . 1 was recorded in September, 1967, while in the Singapore market the average monthly f.o.b. price of R.S.S. No. 1 for the month of November at 49.20 straits cents per pound was the lowest monthly average recorded for the period. The annual average price of spot R.S.S. N o . 1 sheet rubber in the London market declined by 2J| d per pound to 1 sh. 5^6-d. per pound. In the Singapore market the annual average f.o.b. price of this grade of rubber at 54.08 straits cents per pound registered a drop of 11.28 straits cents per pound below 1966 annual average.

Coconut Products

In the world market, prices of edible oils which followed a downward trend in 1966, improved slightly in 1967. Among the factors which contributed to the improvements in prices were, low exports from Philippines owing to a short-fall in production, curtailed shipments of Palm kernel and Palm oil from Nigeria due to political unrest, and disruption of the movements of shipments due to the closure of the Suez Canal. In the World market improvements in the prices of copra and coconut oil during the first half of 1967 were not pronounced and price levels were lower than their corresponding prices in 1966. A marked improvement in prices for coconut products was noticed during the second half of 1967 after the closure of the Suez Canal when prices moved substantially higher than the corresponding prices in 1966.

In the Colombo market, too, prices of coconut products, showed modest re­covery during the first quarter of 1967 from the low levels reached at the end of the last quarter in 1966. During the second and third quarters low demand prevailed owing to uncertainties in the movement of shipments due to the Middle East si­tuation and Colombo market prices declined slightly. A steady improvement in prices was witnessed during the fourth quarter of 1967 due to improved world de­mand. The annual average price at the Colombo market for estate No. 1 copra at Rs. 198.07 per candy registered an increase of Rs. 1.91 or 1.0 per cent, while 'desiccated coconut at Rs. 0.49 per pound increased by two cents or 4.3 per cent, over the 1966 annual average. The annual average price of coconut oil at Rs. 1152.75 per ton registered a fall of Rs. 6.52 or 0.6 per cent below the 1966 annual average price.

In 1967 the aggregate volume of exports of the three major coconut products declined by 8 per cent below the 1966 level. The low level of export volume was mainly due to a fall in coconut production. Coconut production in 1967 was affected by drought conditions. Export volume of all three products registered declines of varying magnitudes in 1967 as compared with 1966. Volume of exports of copra at 316 thousand cwts. declined by 101 thousand cwts. or by 24.2 per cent, coconut oil at 1,334 thousand cwts. declined by 123 thousand cwts. or by 8.4 per cent. Desiccated coconut exports at 926 thousand cwts. declined marginally by 4 thousand cwts. or by 0.4 per cent as compared wity 1,96$, ' *

(157)

The annual average f.o.b. prices of all three products registered a fall in 1967

as compared with 1966. The annual average f.o.b. prices of copra and desiccated

coconut dropped by 0.5 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively. The annual average

price of coconut oil declined steeply by 11.8 per cent below the 1966 level.

Imports

As pointed out earlier the large contraction in imports in 1967 of Rs. 290 million

needs to be interpreted with reservation. The figure of total imports understates

the changes in the value of imports actually received during this year and over­states the value of imports in the preceding year. For example, in the ' food and

drink' sub-group of consumer goods imports, the Customs figure of imports of

rice, flour and sugar at Rs. 514 million, fell short of the value of imports of these

commodities actually received by the Food Commissioner by Rs. 35 million. In

the preceding year the Customs data overstated the value of these imports by

Rs. 121 million. Adjusting for these differences the estimated value of imports

was only Rs. 134 million lower.

Table II (I) 8 gives the factual position after adjusting the Customs data for

p o o d Commissioner's actual imports of rice, flour atnd sugar,

On the basis of adjusted data, the total value of imports in 1967 declined by Rs. 134 million or 7 per cent below that of the proceeding year. Although, the value of imports of 'consumer goods' declined by Rs. 74 million or 7 per cent below 1966, their share in total imports at 55 per cent showed no change over the previous year. Imports of 'Intermediate' and 'investment goods' have registered declines of Rs. 29 million or 6 per cent and 31 million or 9 per cent respectively, while their shares in total imports at 25 per cent and 19 per cent respectively, remained unchanged at the preceding year's levels.

In the consumer goods category, the decline in the value of imports has been shared by the three constituent sub-groups, viz., ' food^and drink' ' textiles' and ' other consumer goods'.

Table II (I) 9 illustrates the volumes, values and the average prices of Food Commissioner's and Customs recorded imports of rice, flour and sugar in respect of the years 1966 and 1967.

It will be seen from these data that in 1967, the Food Commissioner's actual aggregate imports of rice, flour and sugar have at Rs. 549 million increased app­reciably by Rs. 87 million or 19 per cent over 1966. While the value of the Food Commissioner's imports of rice and sugar at Rs. 244 million and Rs. 71 million respectively, fell short of his previous year's imports by Rs. 22 million or 8 per cent and Rs. 4 million or 5 per cent respectively, the value of flour imports increased sharply and at Rs. 234 million was Rs. 113 million or 93 per cent more than in 1966.

The decline in the value of rice imports during the year under review was largely the result of a sharp fall of 113 thousand tons or 23 per cent in the volume of imports of this commodity, the effect of which was to some extent offset by a sharp increase of Rs. 102 per ton or 19 per cent in their average c. and f. prices. The volume of imports of rice in 1967 was lower than that imported in 1966 due largely to the steps taken by Government on the food subsidy front which included besides re­ducing by one measure the subsidised weekly ration o f rice issued to the consumers, policies aimed at increasing local rice production. The sharp increase in the average c. and f. price of rice was in keeping with the trend of prices in the world markets and was the result of poor harvests and consequent shortages.

The large increase of Rs. 113 million in the value of imports of flour is explained by an increase of 253 thousand tons or 96 per cent in the quantity imported. The average c. and f. price at Rs. 453 per ton registered a fall of Rs. 6 per ton or one per cent below the average price in 1966. The increased imports of flour in the year under review was in order to meet an anticipated increase in demand for flour following on the reduction in the subsidised weekly ration of rice in December 1966. While actual consumption of flour increased during 1967, the enhanced im­ports were sufficient not only to meet the increase in consumption but also to build up stocks which increased during the year by about 76,300 tons.1

The drop in the value of imports of sugar in 1967, as compared with the year 1966, was partly the result o f a contraction in the volume o f imports o f sugar by 7 thousand tons or 3 per cent and partly the result of a fall of Rs. 10 per ton or 3 per cent in the average c. and f. price. The fall in the price of sugar is attributable to the increased availability of sugar in the international markets.

Table II (I) 10 gives a breakdown of imports by major categories and commodities or groups of commodities, as reflected in the Customs Returns.

The decline in the total value of imports of Rs. 290 million recorded in 1967 has been shared by the three major categories of imports. The largest decline was in the 'consumer goods' category, imports of which declined by Rs. 230 million or 20 per cent below the previous year's level. The share of these goods in total imports, which in the year 1966 had amounted to 57 per cent fell by 3 per cent to 54 per cent in 1967. While the import values of 'intermediate' and 'investment goods'

fell short of the preceding year's levels by Rs. 29 million or 6 per cent and Rs. 31 million or 9 per cent respectively, their shares in total imports, however, registered increases of 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively to 25 per cent and 19 per cent respectively in the year under review.

The large fall in the value of imports of 'consumer goods' is accounted for large­ly by reduced imports of 'food and drink' items. These imports at Rs. 783 million have declined by Rs. 173 million or 18 per cent below the 1966 level, due mainly to Customs entries relating to government imports of rice, flour and sugar decli­ning in the aggregate by Rs. 69 million or 12 per cent. The changes in actual im­ports of these commodities, however, differed from the Customs entries and are set out in the subsequent paragraphs. Imports of 'milk and milk products' at Rs. 66 million have fallen by Rs. 11 million or 14 per cent below the level reached in 1966, while imports of 'meat and fish' have declined by Rs. 45 million or 45 per cent to Rs. 56 million in 1967. With regard to imports of 'food other' (which includes potatoes, grams, pulses and curry stuffs) the value of imports have at Rs. 126 million recorded a fall of Rs. 44 million or 26 per cent. In this sub-group a part of the decline in the value of imports resulted from the ban on imports of potatoes intro­duced during May 1967. Imports of dried chillies too were reduced. These mea­sures were adopted with a view to encouraging the local production of these items. The reduction in the value of imports of pulses during 1967 as compared with 1966 could be attributed to their reduced availabilty in the world markets following bad crops in Syria.

With regard to the other two sub-groups of 'consumer goods', the value of imports of 'textiles' in 1967 at Rs. 73 million registered a fall of Rs. 46 million or 39 per cent below the level reached in the preceding year. The share of 'textiles' in total imports at 4 per cent declined by 2 per cent. Imports of 'other consumer goods', on the other hand, in value terms declined less sharply and at Rs. 75 million in 1967, recorded a fall of Rs. 11 million or 13 per cent below 1966. The share of these imports in total imports at 4 per cent showed no variation over the preceding year. In the 'other consumer goods' sub-group, imports of 'medicinal and pharma­ceutical products' and 'rubber tyres and tubes' declined by Rs 13 million or 37 per cent and by Rs. 1 million or 20 per cent respectively, the effect of which was to some extent offset by an increase of Rs 7 million in the value of imports of motor cars.

In the 'intermediate goods' category the value of imports of 'petroleum pro­ducts' amounted to Rs. 112 million representing a fall of Rs. 18 million or 14 per cent below the preceding year's level. While the total quantity of these imports at 266 million gallons has declined by 42 million gallons or 14 per cent, their ave­rage c.i.f. price at 42 cents per gallon increased by 2 per cent over the average price in 1966. Imports of 'fertilizers' too have declined in 1967, the value of these imports at Rs. 80 million recorded a fall of Rs. 11 million or 12 per cent. The volume of fertilizer imports into the country in 1967 at 309 thousand tons indicated a fall of 17 thousand tons or 6 per cent, while their average c.i.f. price at Rs. 262 per ton fell by Rs. 21 per ton or 7 per cent. Imports of 'coal' increased by Rs. 6 million to Rs. 9 million in 1967 and 'yarn and thread' by Rs. 3 million to Rs. 45 million. Other notable changes in the category of 'intermediate goods' include declines recorded in the value of imports of 'paper and paperboard', 'tea and other chests' and 'dyeing tanning and colouring materials' by Rs 9 million or 18 per cent, by Rs. 9 million or 50 per cent and by Rs. 3 million or 23 per cent respectively.

( 162)

In the 'investment goods' category imports of 'building materials' and 'transport

equipment' declined by Rs. 22 million or 31 per cent and Rs. 27 million or 23 per

cent respectively . Imports of 'machinery and equipment, on the other hand,

showed an expansion of Rs. 13 million or 8 per cent. In the 'building materials'

sub-group the value of imports of 'cement' at Rs. 9 million registered a fall of Rs.

11 million or 55 per cent below that of the preceding year, and was largely the result

of a sharp contraction in their volume from 247 thousand tons in 1966 to 99 thou­

sand tons in 1967. The average c.Lf. price of cement, however, rose by Rs. 9 per

ton to Rs. 90 per ton thereby offsetting partially the effects on import value of a

decline in import volume.

The total import volume as measured by the Central Bank index declined sharp­

ly during the year and at 85 (base 1958 = 100) indicated a fall of 21 per cent below

the previous year. The separate indices for the major categories of imports show that this contraction in volume was shared by all three major catetories of im­

ports, viz., consumer goods, intermediate goods and investment goods. While

the volume index of consumer goods declined by 20 per cent to 79, the indices of

intermediate and investment goods fell by 14 per cent and 36 per cent respectively

to 128 and 65 respectively. Within the consumer goods category the decline in

volume was confined to the 'food and drink' and 'textiles' sub-groups, whose indices

fell by 21 per cent to 103 and by 43 per cent to 39 per cent respectively. The index

of 'other consumer goods', however, increased by 35 per cent to 35.

The average price of all imports, which had continued to rise during four pre­

ceding years, rose further during the year under review. The Central Bank's index

of import prices averaged 123 during 1967 and was 3 per cent higher than in 1966.

The price indices of major categories of imports show that, while the indices of con­

sumer goods and investment goods rose by 3 per cent and 10 per cent respectively

to 114 and 204 respectively, the price index of intermediate goods declined by 5 per

cent to 86. Within the consumer goods category all three sub-groups registered

increases in prices. The price indices of 'food and drink' and 'textiles' rose by 2

per cent and 5 per cent respectively to 110 and 101 respectively and that of 'other

consumer goods' rose by 2 per cent to 135.

Developments in the Port of Colombo

The Annual Report for 1966 referred to the considerable improvement in the movement of cargoes that took place in the Port of Colombo during the course

of that year. The year 1967 witnessed a further improvement in the conditions

of this Port.

Notwithstanding a 2 per cent increase in the number of vessels entering the Port

of Colombo during the year, there was an appreciable acceleration in the turn-round

of these vessels, the average duration of their period of stay in the port declining

(m >

from 7.5 days in 1966 to 7.1 days in 1967, an improvement of 5 per cent.1 The to­

tal volume o f cargo handled by the Port, however, recorded a fall of 120,721

shipping tons or 4 per cent in 1967, as compared with the preceding year. The dec­

line in the total volume o f cargo handled at this Port was largely the result of a con­

traction of 164,997 shipping tons or 7 per cent in the volume of import cargo dis­

charged during 1967, the effect of which was to some extent offset by an increase

of 44,276 shipping tons or 6 per cent in the volume of export cargo handled during

the year.2 The contraction in the volume of import cargo handled in 1967 was

in keeping with the sharp decline in the volume of total imports (as measured by the Central Bank Trade Indices).

Pattern of Trade

During 1967 Ceylon's exports to the principal monetary areas and regions showed increases in value of varying magnitude, with the exception of the Ster­ling Area exports to which declined. Imports from these areas and regions with the exception of the Dollar Area and the European Economic Community, on the other hand, declined. The value of imports from the Dollar Area and the Euro­pean Economic Community, however, registered increases. Table 11(1) 11 gives the Pattern of Trade by Principal monetary areas and regions.

The value of exports to the Sterling Area during the year amounted to Rs. 795 million, a decrease of Rs. 51 million or 6 per cent below the preceding year. This area's share of Ceylon's total exports at 47 per cent also declined by 3 per cent. Imports from the area at Rs. 616 million declined more sharply by Rs. 288 million or 32 per cent. The Sterling area's share of Ceylon's total imports declined by 12 per cent to 35 per cent in 1967. Merchandise trade balance with the area recorded a surplus of Rs. 180 million in 1967 as against a deficit of Rs. 58 million in 1966.

of Rs. 11 million or 10 per cent. The Dollar Area's share of total exports at 12 per

cent showed no variation as compared with 1966, while its share of total imports

at 7 per cent increased marginally by one per cent. The merchandise trade surplus

with the Dollar Area amounted to Rs. 82 million, which was Rs. 1 million lower

than in 1966.

The value of exports to the Commonwealth at Rs. 751 million increased by

Rs. 65 million or 9 per cent over the previous year, while the value of imports at

Rs. 623 million declined sharply by Rs. 117 million or 16 per cent. The Corrunon-

wealth's share of total exports at 44 per cent showed an increase of 4 per cent and

the share of total imports at 36 per cent declined by 2 per cent, as compared with

the previous year. Ceylon's merchandise trade surplus with the Commonwealth

amounted to Rs. 128 million in 1967 and contrasts with a deficit of Rs. 54 million

recorded for the preceding year.

Exports to the European Economic Community amounted to Rs. 140 million,

increasing by Rs. 11 million or 9 per cent over the previous year. Imports from

the Community at Rs. 269 million, on the other hand, expanded more sharply by

Rs. 49 million or 22 per cent. The Community's share of total exports at 8 per

cent showed no change compared with that of the previous year, but its share of to­

tal imports at 15 per cent increased by 3 per cent. The balance of trade with the Com­

munity, which had shown a deficit of Rs. 91 million in 1966, deteriorated further

by Rs. 38 million to Rs. 129 million during the year under review.

Exports to countries of the European Free Trade Association at Rs. 484 million

increased by Rs. 58 million or 14 per cent in 1967 over the preceding year, while

imports from these countries at Rs. 313 million declined by Rs. 69 million or 18

per cent. The Association's share of total exports at 29 per cent registered an in­

crease of 4 per cent over the previous year and its share of total imports at 18 per

cent fell by one per cent. The merchandise trade surplus with the Association

countries, which in 1966 had amounted to Rs. 44 million increased to Rs.171 mil­

lion during the current year.

The value of exports to countries of the ECAFE region amounted to Rs. 399

million which indicated a drop of Rs. 34 million or 8 per cent below the 1966 level.

The value of imports from this region, however, declined more and at Rs. 736 mil­

lion was Rs. 250 million lower than in the previous year. The region's shares of

Total exports and imports at 24 per cent and 42 per cent respectively, declined by

one per cent and 7 per cent respectively beolw the previous year's levels.

( 167.)

Trade with the People's Republic of China

The total turnover of Ceylon's trade with the People's Republic of China dec­

lined noticeably during 1967, with the value of exports declining by Rs. 24 million

or by 14 per cent to Rs. 153 million, and imports declining by Rs. 32 million or by

15 per cent to Rs. 185 million as compared with the preceding year. The balance

of trade showed a deficit of Rs. 32 million as against a deficit of Rs. 40 million in

1966.

Exports o f rubber to the People's Republic of China, which is the principal

item of export, declined from Rs. 163.6 million in 1966 to Rs. 137.8 million in 1967.

The quantity of rubber exported amounted to 130.9 million pounds as against 132.9

million pounds in 1966. The value of exports of coconut oil in 1967 was Rs. 13.7

million which registered an increase of Rs. 3.9 million above the 1966 export value.

There were no exports of tea during 1967, whereas in 1966 the value of tea exports

amounted to Rs. 3.6 million.

Ceylon's principal import commodity from the People's Republic of China

continued to be rice. The value of rice imports according to Customs data amounted

to Rs. 106.1 million registering a decline of Rs. 11.4 million or 10 per cent below

the 1966 imports. The protocol for 1967 under the Trade and Payments Agree

ment with the People's Republic of China provided for the importation of 200,000

metric tons of rice as against exports of 48,000 metric tons o f sheet rubber from

Ceylon. Imports of sugar from the People's Republic of China accounted for Rs

27.5 million or 37.4 per cent of imports of this item from all sources. Imports of

textiles which was one of the major import items from the People's Republic of

China in recent years declined by Rs. 22.3 million to Rs. 22.6 million in 1967.

Other imports included wheat flour Rs. 6.9 million, dried chillies Rs. 6.6 million

and green gram Rs. 3.9 million.

Trade with the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe

The year 1967 witnessed a sharp decline in Ceylon's turnover of trade with the

U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe. As compared with the preceding year, the values

of exports to and imports from the region at Rs. 104.0 million and Rs. 164.1 mil­

lion respectively, fell by Rs. 50.3 million or 33 per cent and Rs. 38.7 million or 19

per cent respectively. Ceylon's balance of trade with the region, which had shown

a deficit of Rs. 48.5 million in 1966, deteriorated further during the year, the deficit

for the year 1967 amounting to Rs. 60.1 million. The value of Ceylon's trade with

this region, which in the two preceding years had accounted for 10 per cent o f her

total foreign trade, declined by 2 per cent to 8 per cent in 1967.

(168)

As in the previous years, the U.S.S.R. was Ceylon's principal customer of the region, accounting for Rs. 57.1 million or 55 per cent of total exports to the region. The decline of Rs. 25.0 million or 30 per cent in the value of exports to the U.S.S.R. was due to declines in exports of all principal commodities. Exports of rubber, which constituted the major export for the year declined by Rs. 7.3 million or 23 per cent to Rs. 24.0 million in 1967, while exports of tea at Rs. 14.2 million fell by Rs. 7.4 million or 34 per cent. Exports of coconut oil, which had expanded sharply in 1966 registered a fall of Rs. 7.8 million or 35 per cent during the year under review. Exports of copra too declined by Rs. 1.7 million or 36 per cent below the preceding year. Exports to Poland, which amounted to Rs. 12.5 million or 12 per cent of total exports to the region, declined sharply by Rs. 12.3 million or 50 per cent below the level of exports in 1966. As in the previous years, rubber was the principal export, accounting for Rs. 6.8 million and registering a decline of Rs. 12.9 million or 65 per cent below 1966. Exports of coconut oil at Rs. 1.3 million also declined by Rs. 2.3 million or 64 per cent. Exports of tea, which amoun­ted to Rs. 1.0 million in 1966 increased to Rs. 3.1 million during the year under review. This increase in the value of tea exports to Poland was largely the result of the barter agreement which provided for the exchange of 1,000 tons of tea valued at £ 300,000 for textiles of an equivalent value. Exports to Rumania, which had amounted to Rs. 18.0 million in 1966, increased slightly by Rs. 0.7 million or 4 per cent to Rs. 18.7 million in 1967 and accounted for 18 per cent of total exports to the region. This increase in export value was largely the result of an increase in exports of rubber by Rs. 1.7 million or 12 per cent to Rs. 16.4 million, the effect of which was partly offset by reductions in the value of exports of cocoa and coconut oil.

Exports to the German Democratic Republic declined sharply by Rs. 11.2 mil­lion or 59 per cent to Rs. 7.9 million in 1967 and accounted for 8 per cent of total exports to the region. Exports of coconut oil and desiccated coconut accounted for 99 per cent of Ceylon's exports to the German Democratic Republic during the year. While exports of coconut oil at Rs. 6.9 million declined by Rs. 5.1 mil­lion or 43 per cent below the level of exports in 1966, exports of desiccated coconut fell by Rs. 2.1 million or 70 per cent. While exports to Yugoslavia at Rs. 3.2 mil­lion increased by Rs. 0.2 million or 6 per cent, exports to Czechoslovakia and Hun­gary totalled Rs. 2.5 million and Rs. 1.0 million respectively in 1967, registering declines of Rs. 2.4 million or 49 per cent and Rs. 0.3 million or 23 per cent respecti­vely. Exports to Bulgaria at Rs. 1.1 miilion showed no change over the previous year.

U.S.S.R. continued to be by far the largest supplier of imports from the region. Imports from the U.S.S.R. which totalled Rs. 110.3 million, recorded a fall of Rs. 5.7 million or 5 per cent below the previous year. These imports accounted for 67 per cent of total imports from the region. Imports of petroleum products, which as in the immediately preceding years constituted the principal imports accounting for 44 per cent of all imports from the U.S.S.R. declined by Rs. 25.6 million or 35 per cent to Rs. 47.2 million in 1967. Imports of petroleum products from the region, as a whole, amounted to Rs. 56.2 million or 50 per cent of total imports of these products from all sources. Imports of sugar from the U.S.S.R. at Rs. 37.2 million, in 1967 increased sharply by Rs. 27.9 million over the previous year. Other impor­tant items of imports from the U.S.S.R. were tea chests (Rs. 4.9 million), iron and steel products (Rs. 6.4 million), fertilizers (Rs. 4.1 million) and cement (Rs. 3,1.

( M » )

Imports from Poland, which amounted to Rs. 10.1 million or 6 per cent of total imports from the region, declined more viz., by Rs. 21.9 million or 68 per cent compared with the previous year. Sugar was the major import from Poland, representing around 36 per cent of total imports from that country. Sugar was also the principal import from Bulgaria. Total imports from Bulgaria amounted to Rs. 3.8 million. Sugar imports from the region amounted to Rs. 43.3 million and represented 60 per cent of total sugar imports from all sources. Imports from Czechoslovakia amounted to Rs. 9.4 million, a decline of Rs. 6.2 million or 40 per cent. Imports from Czechoslovakia with the exception of condensed milk registered declines. Imports of condensed milk, however, registered an increase of Rs. 0.7 million to Rs. 1.2 million in 1967. Imports from Rumania, which had increased by Rs. 15.6 million in 1966, declined sharply by Rs. 14.2 million or 50 per cent to Rs. 14.1 million in 1967. This decline was largely the result of a fall of Rs. 5,0 mil­lion or 78 per cent in imports of cement. Imports of cement from the region as a whole amounted to Rs. 4.5 million or 82 per cent of imports of this commodity from all sources. Imports from the German Democratic Republic at Rs. 5.2 mil­lion showed no change over the previous year. The sharp increase of Rs. 5.2 mil­lion in the value of imports from Yugoslavia which in 1967 amounted to Rs. 7.8 million was due mainly to increased imports of non-electrical machinery, the value of which in 1967 expanded by Rs. 4.0 million. Imports from Hungary at Rs. 3.4 million registered an increase of Rs. 2.1 million over the preceding year.

Developments in Commercial Policy

Export Control

(a) From March 1, 1967, private sales of tea (straight lines) outside the auc­tion were permitted for shipment to U.S.A. and Canada for a period of 6 months. The period was later extended till the end of Decem­ber 31, 1967.

(b) From May 26, 1967 exports of chanks from Ceylon were restricted to Co-operative Societies only, and henceforth no licences will be issued to individual exporters.

(c) From August 29, 1967 restrictions were placed on the removal of milk foods from Ceylon. For infants under 15 months accompanied by a passenger only one opened 1 lb. tin of infant's milk food is allowed.

Import Control

N o change was effected in the import control licensing procedure and all pri­vate sector imports continued to be within the framework of individual import Hcensingiarrangements during 1967,

Foreign Exchange Budget

The foreign exchange budget as an instrument of resource allocation covering all items of imports continued to be in operation during 1967. In formulating the foerign exchange budget for 1967, the policy adopted was to reduce the import al­location of consumer goods other than essentials where there was a prospect of in­creased domestic production as for instance potatoes and to divert the foreign ex­change conserved to import intermediate and capital goods needed for economic development.

The foreign exchange budget formulated for the year 1967 provided import allocations amounting to an aggregate of Rs. 2,2311 million. The sources of finan­ces were export receipts of 1967, commodity aid arrivals expected in 1967, inclu­ding the spill-over of aid negotiated in 1965 and 1966. The total value of licences

(1) "Foreign Exchange Budget" issued by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs, Ceylon July 1967.

( 1 7 1 )

issued for imports amounted to Rs. 2,055 million, about Rs. 176 million lower than the original estimate. This was due to the fact that resources for financing the budget as forecast, were not realised. The table below gives data pertaining to licences issued in 1966, the original import programmes for 1967 and the value of import licences issued in 1967.

% Includes Rs. 48 million on a "no exchange basis" for the import of Marine and Aviation fuels.

Major reductions in respect of the allocations for "other foodstuffs" were on items such as chillies, malted milk, Bombay onions and potatoes. The imports of potatoes were completely banned with effect from end of May 1967. The reduc­tions in the allocations for chillies, Bombay onions and potatoes were intended to provide a fillip to local production during 1967. The reduction in the allocation for textiles from Rs.124 million in 1966 to Rs. 65 million in 1967 was effected after taking into consideration the presence of large stocks (48 million yards) ashore and afloat at the end of 1966 and in the light of the increased supply from domestic production. In the case of other trade quota items, which includes a host of items, reductions were mainly effected on consumer items on the basis of possible increase in domestic production and on the criteria of "non-essentiality" or low priority.

The following table gives the value of imports during 1967, under first, second and third foreign commodity aid programmes.

lion or 69 per cent of the total value of aid arrivals from all sources in 1967.

The table below shows the aid arrivals in 1967, classified according to commo­

dities. Within Investment and Intermediate goods, the shares of fertilizers and industrial raw meterials and machinery were 30.0 per cent and 29.2 per cent respec­

tively. Within the category of aid in the form of consumer goods representing

31 per cent of the total, shares of wheat flour, textiles and tyres and tubes were 43.3

per cent, 23.9 per cent and 22.2 per cent, respectively.

The Export Incentive Scheme

The Export incentive scheme administered by the Commissioner of Commo­dity Purchase, which came into operation on 1.12.1966 continued to operate during

1967. The industrial goods that were exported under this scheme during 1967, were antimonial lead, batteries, batik textiles, biscuits, canned fruits, cocoa liquor,

confectionery, cotton seed expeller poonac, glycerine(crude), goat skin (chrome tanned), electric lamp holders, canvas shoes (rubber), shirts and leather shoes. The^total foreign exchange realised by the export of the above items was Rs. 3,093,344. The non-industrial goods that were exported during 1967 under this scheme were, ekel brooms, mica, tobacco and wood carvings. The foreign exchange realised

by the goods totalled Rs. 2,016,843. The table below gives the particulars of bonus vouchers issued by the Commissioner of Commodity Purchase, according to indus­trial goods and non-industrial goods.

Import Duties

11-5-67 2 A concessionary rate of import duty was allowed on the imports of Agri­cultural implements, tractors, raw materials, industrial machinery and equipment, components and parts thereof for certain group of industries. These imports required certification by the Director of Development as being essential for local industrial development.

Import Licensing Fees

In the budget for the financial year 1967/68, the import licensing fee of 1 per cent of the value of goods to be imported (other than textiles which is charged a licence fee of 10 per cent) was raised to 10 per cent in respect of all goods, other than milk and milk foods, infants' and invalids foods, cotton yarn, drugs and phar­maceuticals, fertilizers, kerosene, newsprint, mammoties, and other small implements

for agricultural use, which continued to pay the earlier licence fee of 1 per cent. The imports of Government departments, including those of the Food Commis­sioner's were wholly exempted from any import licensing fee. This measure was estimated to yield an additional revenue of Rs. 80 million.

Trade and/or Payments Agreements2

People's Republic of China

A Trade and Payments Agreement was signed on November 6, 1967, with the People's Republic of China for a period of five years beginning January 1, 1968 replacing the earlier agreement for a similar period, which ceased to be valid at the end of 1967. The agreement provided for the conclusion, before the end of Octo­ber each year, of a Protocol relating to commodities to be exchanged during the following year. In terms of the Protocol for 1968 signed on the same date the two countries agreed to exchange exports from each country to the value of Rs. 174 mil­lion, with specific commitments of 75,000 metric tons of sheet rubber of an approxi­mate value of Rs. 150 million on the part of Ceylon and 200,000 metric tons of rice of approximately same value on the part of China.

People's Republic of Bulgaria

A protocol relating to the exchange of commodities with the People's Repub­lic of Bulgaria on a self balancing basis for the year 1968 within the framework of the Trade and Payments Agreement signed on May 15, 1961, was signed on N o ­vember 6, 1967. In terms of this protocol Ceylon was to export tea, cocoa, coconut oil, sheet rubber N o . 1 and No. 2 to the value of £ 540 thousand and the People's Republic of Bulgaria to export to Ceylon wheat, engineering goods, pesticides and urea to the value of £ 540 thousand.
