Information on stocks of raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods, fuels etc. is also being collected from the Manufac\u00adturing and Services sectors. In the Agricultural sector, expenditure on new planting, replanting, upkeep of immature areas and information on livestock is being collected. In the fishing survey, expenditure on purchase, construction and improvement of boats, nets, marine engines etc. is sought. In all the sub-surveys a classification of investments by source of finance is being attempted. Production data are sought only from the company and non-company establishments as it was considered not feasible to obtain reliable data from the other sectors.",

In the rural survey, villages were selected from each district with probability proportional to the population and all households in the selected villages were enumerated.
