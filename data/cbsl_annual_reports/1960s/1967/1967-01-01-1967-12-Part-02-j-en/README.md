(J) PRIVATE INVESTMENT SURVEY

In November 1967, the Central Bank started the second all-island survey of Private Investment. This is to supplement the data collected in the first survey of Private Investment which covered the period 1st April 1963 to 31st March 1964. The results of the first survey were published in the August, November, December 1965 and March 1966 issues of the Central Bank Bulletin.

As statistics of this nature are of vital importance for national income analysis, economic planning and policy formulation, the Central Bank proposes to conduct these surveys jnore frequently.

The present survey was planned on the same lines as the last and is being carried out through a number of sub-surveys covering the various sectors of the economy, viz:—

(a) Company Establishments (b) Non-company Establishments (c) Urban Households (d) Rural Households («?) Fisher Households

Information Collected

The questionnaires were drawn up in consultation with representatives of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs and the Department of Census and Statistics. In all the sub-surveys, except that of Fisher households, information is sought on investment in land, residential construction, non-residential construction, ofiice equipment and furniture and, machinery and equipment. In the case of machinery and equipment an attempt is being made to get a breakdown of the investments costs into local and foreign. Information on stocks of raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods, fuels etc. is also being collected from the Manufac­turing and Services sectors. In the Agricultural sector, expenditure on new planting, replanting, upkeep of immature areas and information on livestock is being collected. In the fishing survey, expenditure on purchase, construction and improvement of boats, nets, marine engines etc. is sought. In all the sub-surveys a classification of investments by source of finance is being attempted. Production data are sought only from the company and non-company establishments as it was considered not feasible to obtain reliable data from the other sectors.

Coverage

The company and non-company establishments were divided into 3 strata, namely, agricultural, manufacturing and services. Except for manufacturing companies where a complete enumeration is attempted, a random sample from each of the other strata has been selected for investigation. All Municipal Councils and Urban Councils but not Town Councils constituted the urban sector. The census blocks used in population censuses by the Department of Census and Statis­tics formed the sampling frame in this sector. In the rural survey, villages were selected from each district with probability proportional to the population and all households in the selected villages were enumerated. The same sampling scheme was used in this fishing survey as in the first Private Investment Survey, i.e. a random area sample of the fishing regions along the coasts of Ceylon.

In order to compile a series of investment figures, the company and non-company establishments have been requested to furnish data for the three year period 1st April 1964 to 31st March 1967. In the urban, rural and fishing surveys,

information relating to the period 1st April 1966 to 31st March 1967, only is being collected as it was considered not feasible to get reliable information for earlier periods.

The questionnaires to the company and non-company establishments have been sent by post, and if necessary these will be followed up with personal interviews. The urban, rural, and fishing surveys are being carried out by personal interviews. The field work of these surveys is in progress and is expected to be completed shortly.
