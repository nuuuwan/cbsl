Employment

Annual figures on employment and unemployment, are not available except

for certain years during which sample surveys on employment were conducted.

The only available figures that have some relevance are the number of registrants

for employment and better employment with the Employment Exchanges. Even

though these figures are highly unsatisfactory as an indicator of the extent of un­

employment, they can be made use of for purposes of studying the change in un­

employment over a period.

During 1967, there was a 7.6 per cent rise in the number of registrants com­

pared with the 19.7 per cent rise during 1966 and the 20.7 per cent rise during

1965. The increase during 1967, in the different categories of registrants were

9.8 per cent in technical and clerical, 8.9 per cent in skilled, 10.8 per cent in semi­

skilled and 3.5 per cent in unskilled. The corresponding comparable figures for

1966 were 19.7, 8.4, 22.9 and 20.7 per cent respectively.

Table 11 ( H ) - l shows the number of persons placed in employment in recent

years by the Labour Exchanges.

Employment in the Public Sector

The annual inquiry by the Central Bank into changes in employment in the

public sector was repeated for 1967. On addressing all the Government and

semi-Government Institutions the bank was able to obtain data from 73 per cent

of Government departments and 83 per cent of semi-Government institutions.

The latter group includes the Government Corporations, the Universities, and the Central Bank.

In the 57 Government Departments that responded to the Bank's inquiry there were altogether 111,4-56 employees at the end of 1967 as against 108,025 at

the end of 1966 in the same departments. O f these employees 83 per cent were

permanent, 8 per cent temporary, and 9 per cent casual. The corresponding

figures, as at the end of 1966 were 85, 8 and 7 per cent respectively. Taking the

difference between the employment figures at the end and at the beginning of the

year as a measure of the change in employment it is estimated that permanent and

temporary employment in government departments has increased by 1.3 per

cent over the year. No estimate of the change in casual employment is given

here because of the highly fluctuating nature of the numbers employed as casual

employees.

In the 39 semi-Government institutions from which the Bank was able to

obtain figures there were 105,150 employees at the end of 1967 as against 104,223

at the end of 1966. O f these 73 per cent were permanent, 9 per cent temporary

and 18 per cent casual. The comparable figures, as at the end of 1966, Were 69,

12 and 19 per cent, respectively. Based on the response to the inquiry, permanent

and temporary employment in the semi-Government institutions increased by

2 per cent.

Labour Relations

The figures for the year on strikes and man-days lost available at the time of

writing this report are provisional. In the past they have been under-estimated

mainly owing to the fact that data for the last two months of the year, during which

period incidence of strikes tends to be higher, are usually incomplete.

Compared with 1966 the number of man-days lost in 1967 in the plantation

sector shows a marked decrease. However, the year 1966, it would be recalled,

recorded an exceptionally large loss of man-days in the plantation sector. The

figure for 1967 when compared with the average for the past decade excluding

1966 shows an increase of 3 per cent. In the non-plantation"sector the number of

man-days lost in 1967 is substantially higher than that in 1966. This comparison,

as in the plantation sector, does not provide a realistic picture. The figure for

1967 when compared with the average for the past decade has, in fact, fallen by

8 per cent.

( 1 4 4 )

About 37 per cent of the strikes were due to loss of employment, 21 per cent

due to estate rules, working arrangements, etc. and another 11 per cent to general

demands.

Table II (H) 2 shows the number of strikes, the number of workers involved

and the number of man-days lost as a result of strikes.

The underlying causes for strikes in 1967 have remained unchanged. As in

the past the main causes were dismissals or loss of employment causing 37 per cent, estate rules, working arrangement, etc., causing 21 per cent and general demands

causing another 11 per cent of the strikes.
