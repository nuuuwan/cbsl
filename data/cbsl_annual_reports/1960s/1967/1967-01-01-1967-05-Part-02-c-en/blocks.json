    "text": "The increase in money supply did not occur at a uniform pace during the year under review. As can be seen from Table II (C) 1, in the month of January, there was a continuation of the sharp declining trend of money supply characteristic of the last five months of the previous year. In February and March, there was an abnormal expansion of money supply mainly as a result of a strike of employees of commercial banks. With the normalisation of banking services following the end of the strike, the money supply started declining in the month of April. By the end of August, the money supply had dropped to a level which was only slightly higher than that at the beginning of the year. The last four months of the year, however, were marked by a substantial increase in money supply amounting to a monthly average of Rs. 3 2 . 5 million in contrast to the sharp decline in money supply recorded in the corresponding period of the previous year. This divergence in the experience of the two years was the result of the large expansionary effect of Govern\u00adment's fiscal operations in the last four months of 1967 in contrast to the heavy contractionary effect of declining external banking assets in the corresponding period of 1966.",

While the country's balance of international payments continued to be unfavourable, its con\u00adtractionary influence on money supply in 1967 was less than half of that in 1966. Government's fiscal operations, however, exerted a larger expansionary impact on money supply in 1967 than in the previous year. The financial operations of the private sector with the banking system produced a small net contractionary effect on money supply compared to a substantial expansionary effect in 1966.",

From 35.6 per cent at the end of 1956, the proportion of currency to money supply rose to 55.0 per cent at the end of 1963. There was a noticeable abatement in this tendency in the next two years, with the proportion of currency to money supply declining to 52.5 per cent at the end of 1965. In 1966 and 1967, however; it moved up again, and at the end of the latter year it was only slightly below the peak level reached at the end of 1963.",

The monthly average of demand deposits in 1967 was Rs. 806.9 million as compared to Rs. 805.7 million in 1966. The rate of turnover of demand deposits, however, registered a slight decrease during the year. There was a particularly marked decline in this rate in the months of February and March on account of the bank strike. In the latter half of the year the turnover rate rose to very nearly the same level as in the corresponding period of the previous year. The average monthly rate of turnover of demand deposits in 1967 was 1.60 as compared to 1.64 in 1966.",

Furthermore, there was no discernible increase in the rate of turnover of demand deposits con\u00adsequent on the withdrawal of this tax. The continuing fall in the ratio of demand deposits to money supply and the rising tendency to hold currency notes of the larger denominations point to the prevalence of hoarding and, possibly, tax evasion.",

The demand deposits of plantations, on the other hand, fell by Rs. 5 5 million due to the depressed conditions in the export sector. The decline of Rs. 6.7 million in the demand deposits of trading institutions was probably a reflection of their in\u00adcreased tendency to hold time deposits. The proportion of demand deposits of the trading sector to total demand deposits decreased from 23.0 per cent at the end of 1966 to 20.4 per cent at the end of 1967. The increase of Rs. 72.4 million in the demand deposits of other business institutions was higher than the increase in total demand deposits. Thus their share of total demand deposits increased from 11.3 per cent to 19.5 per cent in the year. A certain portion of the increase in deposits in this category may be due to the increase in balances of manufacturing firms whose level of activity was higher during the year. It also represents, in part, an increase in balances of Government corporations.",

Savings deposits of individuals, which account for 91 per cent of total savings deposits with banks, were responsible for the increase in 1967. Apart from the expansionary effect of Government's fiscal operations, certain other factors also might have contributed to the increase in time and savings deposits of the private sector with the banking system. There have been some upward movements in interest rates paid on these deposits in 1965 and in the beginning of 1967. The extension of the branch network of commercial banks also might have led to an increase in these deposits as well as demand deposits.",

In addition, commercial banks enhanced their lending capacity by recourse to borrowing from the Central Bank on a larger scale than in the previous year. Therefore, the operations o f the commercial banks in the year under review were characterised by a marked increase in credit both to the private and to the government sectors. Credit to the private sector increased by Rs. 104.8 million as compared to an increase of Rs. 92.1 million in the previous year, and short term credit to the Government increased by Rs. 139.5 million in contrast to a decline of Rs. 48.0 million in the previous year. The increase in credit to the private sector was mainly for agricultural, industrial and commercial purposes, while the increase in credit to the Government sector was to finance food imports, a substantial part of which was used for building up stocks.",
