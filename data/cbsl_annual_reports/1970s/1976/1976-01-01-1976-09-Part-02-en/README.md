A REVIEW OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE E. P. F. DEPARTMENT

Introduction

The Employees' Provident Fund Department of the Central Bank of Ceylon was set up on 1st August, 1958, in terms of the Employees' Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 which provided for the establishment of a provident fund for employees in the private and semi-government sectors. It is charged with the responsibility of receiving contributions made to the Fund, maintaining proper accounts of the Fund and of the individual members of the Fund, effecting refunds of contributions and investing the monies of the Fund. This department works in close co-operation with the employees' Provident Fund Division of the Labour Department, which attends to the administration and enforcement of the Act.

A comparative summary of the operations of the Fund for the period 1971-1976 is depicted in the table annexed.

Membership and Covered Employments

During the ten year period, 1966-1975, the membership of the Fund has increased from 1,543,151 to 2,291,022 i. e. an average annual increase of approximately 4.8 per cent. In 1971, as a result of an amendment to the E. P. F. Act, which widened the coverage under the Act. to include all employments, including those with a single employee (except domestic servants and religious and charitable organisations) the annual increase in membership rose to 7 per cent as against the previous year's annual increase of 4 per cent. Since then, the annual rate of increase in membership has been following a downward trend. A 3.8 per cent increase (approximately) in membership was recorded in 1975.

There was a 47.9 per cent increase in the number of covered employments in 1971, whilst during the five year period 1971-1975, the number of covered employ­ments increased from 34,253 to 46,539 i. e. an average annual increase of app­roximately 7.2 per cent. There was a 5.2 per cent increase (approximately) in the number of covered employments in 1975.

Contributions

Contributions to the Fund was fixed at 4 per cent of the total earnings by the the employee and 6 per cent by the employer initially. In 1971, when coverage under the act was extended to include all employments, except domestic servants etc., these rates were raised to 6 per cent and 9 per cent respectively which resulted in a significant increase in contribution to the Fund (approximately Rs. 49 million).

Contributions received by the Fund have increased from approximately Rs. 12 million in 1959, the first year of operation, to Rs. 237 million in 1976. There was a 48.9 per cent increase in contributions in 1971 over 1970, whilst during the period

( 44 )

1971-1976, contributions to the Fund increased from Rs. 148 million to Rs. 237 million, i. e. an average annual increase of approximately 10.0 per cent. An in­crease of approximately 9.7 per cent was recorded in 1976.

Investments

The E. P. F. Department has, since its inception, been one of the major subs­cribers to loans raised by the Public Debt Department of the Central Bank. In 1959, the first year of operation, its investments in Government Securities amounted to Rs. 9 million whilst investments made in 1976 amounted to Rs. 292 million. Invest? ments increased by 93.1 percentin 1971 over 1970, whilst during the period 1971-1976, investments increased from Rs. 195 million to Rs. 292 million, i.e. an average ann­ual increase of approximately 8.3 per cent. The increase recorded in 1976 was 11.5 per cent, approximately.

Refunds

In 1959, the Fund paid out approximately Rs. 09 million by way of refunds to members. The Fund's liability on this account has been increasing over the years. During the period 1971-1976, refunds have increased from Rs 41 million to Rs 104 million, i.e. an average annual increase of approximately 25.6 per cent. But the number of refunds effected increased from 45,956 in 1971 to 59,955 in 1974, i.e. an average annual increase of approximately 7.6 per cent. Subsequently, the number of refunds effected fell by 12 per cent to 52,780 in 1975 and rose to approximately 11.7 per cent to 58,993 in 1976. The average annual increase during the period 1971-1976 was approximately 4.7 per cent. This means that the average amount paid out per refund increased from approximately Rs 891 to Rs 1,762 during this period.

It will be observed that in last year's review, the number of refunds effected in 1974 was given as 69,829, which included part payments of refunds as well. This figure has since been adjusted to 59,955 as will be seen in the attached table.

Interest on Members' Contributions

The E. P. F. is required to pay interest on members' balances out of the income from the investment of the monies of the Fund. The rate was initially fixed at a minimum of 2\ per cent by the E. P. F. Act. The actual rate of interest has been gradually raised to 6 per cent by the end of 1974.
