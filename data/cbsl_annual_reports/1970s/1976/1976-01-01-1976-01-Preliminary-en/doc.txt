Dear Sir,

In accordance with the provisions of Section 35(1) of the Monetary Law Act (Cap. 422), I submit herewith the Twenty-seventh Annual Report of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Ceylon covering the Bank's operations during the year 1976.

With the passage of time, the Annual Reports of the Monetary Board have expanded their coverage beyond the requirements of the law by presenting a detailed review of economic trends and developments in the various sectors of the Sri Lanka economy. In respect of the Reports for 1975 and thereafter, it was decided to publish this Review as a separate Report and issue it annually under the title "Review of the Economy". Accordingly, a detailed review of economic trends and developments in the various sectors of the Sri Lanka economy for 1976 will be published in the course of next month under the title "Review of the Economy".

I am, dear Sir,

Yours faithfully,

H . E. T E N N E K O O N . Governor
