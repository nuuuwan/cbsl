    "text": "The principal reason for the reduced deficit in 1976 compared to 1975 is that while export earnings increased by nearly Rs. 800 million, import payments increased by less than Rs. 100 million. Consequently the trade deficit which was about Rs. 1,400 million in 1975 was reduced to a deficit of about Rs. 700 million in 1976. More specifically, while merchandise exports amounted to Rs. 4,707.3 million, merchandise imports were Rs. 5,416.6 million. This left a merchandise or visible trade deficit of Rs. 709.3 million in 1976. The net invisible transactions surplus of Rs. 112.2 million reduced the goods and services account deficit to Rs. 597.1 million. A surplus of Rs. 547.3 million in the transfer payments reduced the deficit in the goods and services account to Rs. 49.8 million. The main component of transfer payments was official receipts of Rs. 491.6 million as outright gifts received from foreign governments and international agencies.
