Higher levels of production of ceramics, cement, bricks and tiles were responsible for the gain in production in this sector. It is significant that the imported raw material content of this category of industry is one of the lowest among the industrial groups. It is also noteworthy that the labour absorption by this group is high and that its rate of growth in value added of 45 per cent was one of the highest recorded in 1976.",
