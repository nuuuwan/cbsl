In many of these surveys, collection of data related to the workforce was incidental. The data from these sources are not strictly comparable due to differences in definition. Further\u00admore such data are not frequent enough to make up a time series of observations. The developments during 1976 in respect of employment and unemployment can therefore be discussed only in general terms. In the case of unemployment, its size is such that inaccuracies in its estimates are unlikely to affect the basic trend.",

An increase of over 55,000 employed persons in the semi-government institutions (public corporations, universities, research institutes, statutory boards, etc.) is wholly accounted for by the increase in the number of employees in the State Plantations Corporation. Estate acreage that came under its management during the year was proportionately higher than the increase in the number of employees.
