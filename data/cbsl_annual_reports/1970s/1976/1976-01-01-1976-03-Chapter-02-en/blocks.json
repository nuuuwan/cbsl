Despite this decline, the manufacturing sector showed a growth rate of 1.9 per cent due to an increase in the output of factory and cottage industries. In factory industries, the increase in the value added was 4.8 per cent as compared to an increase of 8.0 per cent in 1975. The output of cottage industries in 1976 increased by 8.1 per cent, which is a higher rate of increase than in 1975 when it increased by 3.3 per cent.

Although the availability of building materials improved in 1976, the limited supply and availability of cement and the higher prices of building materials were major constraints on a more rapid expansion of construction. The production of this vital material increased by only 7.7 per cent in 1976 after a decrease of 20.0 per cent in the previous year.

For both these reasons, it is important to ensure the recovery of the coconut industry by investment and pursuit of proper cultivation practices.

This diversion created a potential to double crop 134,000 acres of paddy lands under irrigation tanks. However, it has not been possible to cultivate a greater part of this acreage in Yala 1976, largely due to the low rainfall in the catchment area of the Mahaweli river in the first half of 1976 and a high rate of water absorption by the soil due to the parched condition of many tanks and canals after the severe drought in 1975 and 1976.",

Nearly 55 per cent of this acreage is for irrigated paddy cultivation while the remainder is for highland crop cultivation. However, owing to the delay of the North-East Monsoon and the low discharge of Mahaweli waters in 1976, farmers were unable to cultivate their Maha crops in time and only about 3,000 acres of paddy and 2,000 acres of highland crops have been cultivated in the Kalawewa area during Maha 1976/77.
