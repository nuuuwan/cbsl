    "text": "The rate of growth of Sri Lanka's economy in 1976 was of the same order of magnitude as in the four years immediately preceding. The moderate growth of this period was largely due to the sub-normal performance of the agricultural sector. The outcome of external trade turned out to be favourable for the country, after many years. Export prices continued to improve mainly as a result of the economic recovery of the industrial countries. Unlike in previous years when there was an escalation of import prices, the country's trading position was strengthened by decreases in import prices in 1976. Food imports, mainly consisting of rice, wheat, wheat flour and sugar, experienced substantial price reductions due to increased world production of these commodities. However, the upward trend in the prices of intermediate and investment goods, which reflected the inflationary conditions in the industrial countries, as well as the increase in petroleum prices, continued. Overall movements of export and import prices were such that, for the first time in 15 years, the trend of rapidly declining terms of trade was reversed. This improvement in the terms of trade resulted in a minimal deficit in the merchandise trade. In the fiscal sector there was substantial financing of the budget deficit from expansionary sources of finance. This combined with the increase in net foreign assets resulted in an unprecedented increase in money supply.",

Agriculture remains the single largest sector and accounts for about one-third of the Gross National Product. Since a substantial proportion of the services is ancillary to the agricultural sector and the industrial output as computed also includes value added in the processing of agricultu\u00adral commodities, the real importance of this sector is even larger. Furthermore, the output in agriculture is highly dependent on a few crops notably tea, rubber, coconut and paddy. The first three of these crops account for the major proportion of foreign exchange earnings and consequently their performance is an important determinant of the country's import capacity. In the case of paddy its volume of production has an important bearing on the volume of cereal imports.",

    "text": "The terms of trade which declined continuously from 142 in 1962 to 46 in 1975, improved to 62 in 1976. This reversal in trend was the consequence of a number of favourable factors. Industrial countries, which had been under the grip of recession and inflation, increased their production and were able to reduce their rates of inflation. The resulting rise in income levels, in real as well as nominal terms, was favourable for Sri Lanka's exports which are income elastic. Higher demand led to better tea prices. High crude oil prices increased synthetic rubber prices while the recovery of the motor vehicle industry increased the demand for rubber. These factors kept rubber prices buoyant. Tea and rubber price increases were in spite of increased world production of these commodities. Even though Sri Lanka's exports declined in volume, the increased prices helped to obtain subs\u00adtantially higher export earnings. The complementary developments in imports were a higher volume of imports and a lower import bill. The food imports of Sri Lanka, the value of which in 1975 formed 48 per cent of the total import bill, declined sub\u00adstantially to 33 per cent due to lower prices consequent on good harvests in the expo\u00adrting countries. These developments were responsible for a remarkably small trade deficit of Rs. 105 million and a current account deficit of only Rs. 49.8 million in the balance of payments.",
