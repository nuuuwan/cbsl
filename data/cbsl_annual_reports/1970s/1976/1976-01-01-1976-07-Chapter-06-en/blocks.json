Subscriptions to rupee securities in 1976 reflect a contribution of Rs 240 million from commercial banks as against' negligible or no contributions in the several preceding financial years. Similarly by the end of the year the total increase of Rs 350 million in Treasury bills in 1976 was held by the Central Bank. In conrast to a gradual decline observed in the last several years, this led to an increase in the share of the domestic debt held by the banking system from 29.9 per cent in 1975 to 30.6 per cent in 1976. In 1970, the share of the domestic debt held by the banking system was 45.1 per cent.",

During the year, effects of government's deficit financing and increased external assets were large enough to obscure the seasonal changes that occurred. Some of the factors generating seasonal changes did not show up at all. For instance, the level of advances under the Guaranteed Price Scheme, which are generally sea\u00adsonal, rose to Rs 371 million in July 1976 and continued to remain high during the rest of the year.",

The Government had heavy recourse to financing from the banking system in an attempt to maintain a high level of capital and recurrent expenditure including wel\u00adfare subsidies in the face of a sluggish increase in revenue. There was a sharp expan\u00adsion in bank credit in favour of the government, which was offset to some extent by an increase jn its deposits with the banking system. Altogether, commercial bank credit to government increased by Rs 366 million during the year. While commercial",
