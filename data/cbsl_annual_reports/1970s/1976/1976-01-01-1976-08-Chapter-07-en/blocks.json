There was a sharp expan\u00adsion in bank credit in favour of the government, which was offset to some extent by an increase jn its deposits with the banking system.

In addition, the net foreign exchange holdings of commercial banks recorded an increase of Rs 165 million, in contrast to the decline of Rs 7 million in the previous year. The rise in the net foreign assets of the Central Bank was the outcome of increases in cash and balances abroad, foreign government securities, holdings of Special Drawing Rights, offset to some extent by the deposits of international organisations and borrowings abroad. In all, cash and balances abroad increased by Rs 331 million, while foreign government securities and holdings of Special Drawing Rights rose by Rs 26 million and Rs 28 million, respectively.

The comm\u00adercial banks' discount rate on commercial bills moved up at the beginning of the year, the maximum rate rising from 12 per cent to 13 per cent. Information on lending rates of commercial banks is available only on the basis of security furnished by the respective borrowers. The maximum rates on loans and overdrafts secured by several categories of securities moved up in January 1976, i.e. before the bank deposits started building up. The maximum rate on loans and advances secured by government securities rose from 11 per cent to 14 per cent,shares of joint stock companies from 12 per cent to 13 per cent, stock in trade from 13 per cent to 14 per cent, immovable property from 12 per cent to 14 per cent and 'others' from 13 per cent to 14 per cent. Thus, whereas the maximum rate of 14 per cent applied to only the unsecured advances in 1975, the maximum rate in respect of most of the secured advances moved upto 14 per cent in 1976.",

In contrast to the experience in the previous year, growth of deposits provided a very substantial increase in resources.

Resources provided through increased deposits were marginally augmented by increases in fore\u00adign borrowing, paid up capita,l reserve funds and undistributed profits, and in other liabilities. A reduction in the level of Central Bank accommodation con\u00adstituted the only change during the year which contributed to reduce the resources available to commercial banks.

Secondly, a ceiling on bank credit for non-essential purposes was imposed with effect from October 4,1976. Although an upward revision of the Bank Rate was also considered, implementation of this was postponed until January 26, 1977, when the Bank Rate was raised by two percentage points to 8 | per cent.",

Government fiscal operations and the growth in external banking assets were the main causes of the monetary expansion in 1976. In this context, monetary po'icy per se is of limited usefulness in combating it. During 1976, bank credit (net) in favour of the private sector, which includes government corporations and co-operative institutions, increased by only Rs 70 million. In a situation where monetary expansion has not been accompanied by an undue ex\u00adpansion of bank credit in favour of the private sector, a tight monetary policy can prove to be counter-productive in restraining price increases. The rather mild monetary policy pursued in 1976 in the midst of a very sharp monetary expansion should be viewed in this context.",
