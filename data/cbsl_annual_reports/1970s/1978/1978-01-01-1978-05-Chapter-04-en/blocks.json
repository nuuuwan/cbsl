    "text": "This remarkable and unprecedented spurt of industry in 1978 could be described as the spontaneous reaction of domestic industry to its emancipation from the straitjacket of controls after the re-orientation of economic policies in 1977. Liberalization of Imports made raw materials and spares easily available. As a result, inventories could be scaled down, and capacities utilized to a greater extent. Limited competition from imports necessitated the up-grading of quality In a competitive environment. It appears that certain industries were so inefficient that they were unable to compete even under substantial import protection and were driven to the wall, but it is worth examining whether such industries should be protected and nurtured for ever at a high social and economic cost. The high employment oriented handloom textile industries were faced with a critical challenge from superior and highly competitive textile imports, arising largely from the decision to supply the domestic market with cheap and better textiles by administrative waiver of protective tariffs. It appears that continued sudsidization of employment in the handloom industry at the expense of the consumer may be counter productive in the long run, as it encourages a low level of efficiency. It might be preferable to improve the technology and the quality with a view to catering to the high quality international markets.",

In current value terms, private sector industrial output expanded by 30 per cent, while the public sector output rose by 26 per cent. Capacity utilization which was about 61 per cent last year, rose to 70 per cent in 1978. Employment in industry has grown by about 15 per cent, private sector employment rising by 17 per cent, and public sector employment by 13 per cent. The usage of imported raw materials in industry rose from 66 per cent in 1977 to 79 per cent in 1978. This was an inevitable short-term development of the freeing of the bulk of raw materials from import licensing. Hereafter, import tariffs and not quantitative restrictions, will have to be used in encouraging the substitution of imports by domestic raw materials, wherever comparative advantages exists.",

By contrast, the growth sectors of last year were food and beverages, paper and fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment. Apparently, the slowing down in the growth of food and beverage industry was due to supply, problems (e. g. meat, milk, jaggery, etc.) and some import competition. Industries in the field of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment (e. g. cutlery and crockery, motor spares, engineering tools) appear to have suffered a setback primarily on account of import competition.",

The expansion of the non-metallic products sector was largely due to a sharp increase in the produc\u00adtion of cement, bricks and tiles. In the chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastics sector, the increases came from the petroleum, tyre and rubber industries. The output growth in paper and paper products group arose from the higher output of the Paper Corporation and a revival of the paper products industy after imports were relaxed. In the field of textiles, garments and leather products, it appears that a rise in the output of larger manufactu\u00adring units more than offset a drop in small industry output.",

    "text": "As mentioned in last year's Annual Report, the economic reforms of 1977 signalled a change in emphasis in the industrial field from import substitution under a high protective wall towards export-oriented development. A major arm of the new strategy was the establishment of \"Export Processing Zones\" within a 200 square mile territory, under the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC). Foreign investors, with or without local collaboration, in export oriented industries were invited into these industrial zones. Firms were offered attractive incentives such as a 7 to 10 year tax holiday and a concessionary turnover tax thereafter, exemption from import and export duties and harbour dues, a limited but preferred access to the domestic market and exemption from exchange controls on foreign transactions. Outside the GCEC area, the policy with regard to foreign investment was much more selective and investnments were generally to be limited to export-oriented industries or to areas where significant technology gaps existed locally. A Foreign Investment Advisory Committee (FIAC) vetted such investments. Local industries which required the import of capital of more than Rs. 700,000 required a licence, and such permission was granted by a Local Investment Advisory Committee (LIAC). Data on industries approved by the respective authorities during 1978 are given in the following table 1'7.",

Several fiscal and other concessions are contemplated to foster a more balanced regional dispersal of industry. But modern industry tends to be footloose; and for such industries the contemplated concessions could be only marginal. Hence it might be advisable to foster regional dispersal of industries by setting up regional industrial centres, with the necessary infrastructure to attract investment outside the Colombo district.",
