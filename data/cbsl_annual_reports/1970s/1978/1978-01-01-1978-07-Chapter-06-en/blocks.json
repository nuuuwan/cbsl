Similarly, wages of minor employees rose by 16 per cent and that of school teachers, by 10 per cent, as compared with increases of 2 per cent each in the previous year. The major reason for this increase in money wage rates was the pay rise granted to government employees in December, 1977. Although money wages showed a substantial increase over the previous year, they remained constant through\u00adout 1978. A more substantial wage increase was announced in November, 1978 but this would come into effect only in 1979- Allowing for the rate of inflation in the economy, real wages in this sector appear to have declined, except in the case of minor employees.",

The corresponding increases in 1977 were 25 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. Discounting for inflation, it appears that the real wages rose in this sector. Factors contributing to this were the extension of the pay rise granted to government employees in December, 1977 to the private sector, the increase in the cost of living allowance corresponding to the rise in the Colombo Consumers' Cost of Living Index, the grant of a price-related wage supplement in tea and rubber plantations.",

There is some evidence that, faced with declining real wages, employees in public as well as private sectors have tended to supplement their nominal incomes by needless 'overtime' work beyond normal hours and by engaging in part-time private vocations, which is reflected by the high degree of absenteeism in normal work places. This is inevitable in situations where inflation is allowed to erode money incomes. Relating wages to productivity and judicious com\u00adpensation for inflation are more appropriate remedies for this problem than attempts to eradicate such activity by fiat.",
