    "text": "Substantial deceleration in the rate of monetary expansion after two successive years of rather sharp increases in money supply was the principal feature of monetary developments in 1978. The money supply, which is the sum total of currency and demand deposits held by the public, increased by Rs. 570 million or 11 per cent during the year. This compared with annual increases of 35 per cent and 29 per cent in 1976 and 1977, respectively. The year-on-year increase in money supply which exceeded 25 per cent throughout 1977 over the levels in the corresponding months of the previous year, exceeded this level only during the first four months of the year in 1978. As observed from Table 1.15, the annual rate of monetary expansion in 1978 declined progressively from 35 per cent in January to 14 per cent in July and had some-what stabilised around this level thereafter. In December, 1978 however, it registered a further noticeable decrease reaching a level of 11 per cent. Underscoring the slowing down of the rate of monetary expansion, the monthly average rise in money supply which was 2\u00b71 per cent in 1977 declined to 0\u00b79 per cent in 1978, while the monthly average increases over the corresponding levels of the previous year decreased from 32 to 20 per cent.",

    "text": "Major underlying factors for the deceleration in the rate of monetary expansion were the contraction resulting from the fiscal operations of the government sector and the very substantial build-up of time and savings deposits by the non-bank private sector. During the year, Government revenue plus non-expansionary sources of borrowing exceeded total expenditure by a significant margin. Consequently, government sector operations, including changes in Central Bank's other liabilities and accounts (net), resulted in a contractionary impact of Rs. 1,520 million on the money supply. On the other hand, despite a record increase in bank credit to private sector amounting to little over Rs. 3,000 million during the year, the expansionary impact of this sector's operations was confined to Rs. 688 million, largely owing to a very substantial build-up of time and savings deposits by other private seLtor constituents within this sector. The latter was the result of the high interest rate policy pursued during the year.",

Generally, bank credit to co-operative institutions rise somewhat sharply during the first half of each year and tend to decline equally sharply during the fourth quarter. In 1978, bank credit to this sectOr rose to Rs. 1,922 million by June, but declined to Rs. 1,675 million by December. The seasonal pattern in the movement of bank credit in this sector would have been mu\u20ach more pronounced, but for the fact that the commercial banking system held a sum of Rs. 297 million in suspense on behalf of the Paddy Marketing Board pending liquidaticn of matured Goods Receipts and a further Rs' 171 million of past-due Goods Receipts. The amount held in suspense was unusually high this year because the magnitude of maturing Goods Receipts during the last quarter was high, reflec-ting heavy paddy purchases during the first half of the 'year.

The growth in external banking assets was entirely due to increased resources available in the capital account of the balance of payments.

A very sharp increase of Rs. 3,026 million in commercial bank credit to this sector was the major contributory factor for this development. Durin~ the year, bank credit to \"other private sector\" constituents increased by a record of Rs. 1,890 million, while credit to government corporations and to co-operative institutions rose by Rs. 693 million and Rs. 443 million, respectively. Thus, \"other private sector\" which exerted a contraction in money supply during the previous year, reversed its role in 1978, exerting an expansionary impact of Rs. 539 million, despite a substantial increase of Rs. 1,351 million in its time and savings deposits. The sharp rise in bank credit to this sector could be explained by the increased credit requirements following;the reorientation of economic policy in November, 1977. '",

The slow down during the second half could be partly attributed to the restraining influence of credit ceilings operative during this period.

This was the second year in succession when the Government's financial operations resulted in a considerable contrac-tionary i,mpact on the money suppl y. This had been the combined outcome of an increase in Government's deposits with the banking system and to a lesser extent, a decrease in bank credit. Altogether, Government's deposits with the banking system registered a record increase of Rs. 1,050 million during the year. ThiS, however, included a sum of Rs. 390 million deposited with the Central Bank, being the Governm~nt's contribution to the capital of the National Development Bank. Commercial bank credit to Government during the year decreased by Rs. 113 million, while credit from the Central Bank rose by Rs.38 million, recording a net reduction of Rs. 75 million in bank credit to Government. These transactions, together with an increase of Rs. 394 million in Central Bank's other liabilities and accounts (net) resulted in the Govern-ment sector exerting an overall contractionary influence of Rs. 1,520 million ,on the money supply during the year.",

However, the net outflow of resources to this sector was confined to Rs. 350 million, owing to an increase of Rs. 1,540 million in this sector;s deposits with the banking system. The higher resource utilisation by this sector was a reflection of higher level of' activity in that sector, follOWing the new economic policies. Government corporations increased their borrowing by Rs. 693 million, but their net resource intake was reduced to Rs \u2022. 282 million by a rise of Rs. 411 million in their deposits with commercial banks.

    "text": "During 1978, there were no noticeable changes in either the level or the structure of interest rates. Both the Bank rate and the Treasury bill rate remained unchanged at 10 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. There were hardly any changes in the rates offered by commercial banks on time and savings deposits or those charged on . loans . and advances. Interest rates on time and savings deposits at the NSB also, by iind large, remained unchanged but some modifications to the facilities available at the NSB were intro-duced during the year. These included payment of monthly interest on time deposits at 14\u00b74 per tent pet annum on one year deposits from July 2, 1978 and at 16.8 per cent on 18 months deposits from October 1, 1978 subject to a minimum deposit of Rs. 5,000. Flom October 1,1978 the monthly interest on one year deposits exceeding Rs. 100,000 was raised to 15per cent. The NSB also announced the part payment of interest on new time deposits effected after July 2, '1978 on premature withd'rawals of such deposits. Until then, premature withdrawal of time deposits resulted in a complete los8 of interest. Thelending rates of the State Mortgage Bank, D~velopment Finance Corporation and\u00b7 the National Housing Department remained unchanged in 1978. There were also no changes in the lending rates of the Medium and Long-term Credit Fund of the , , . Central Bank. The lending rates of the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation which recorded a 3 percentage points increase in November, 1977 declined marginally by one percentage point in June, 1978. Another change observed in the lending rates was a single percentage point increase by the NSB on building and other loans, from May, 1978. The rate on government bonds (10-12 year bonds) which rose from 9 per cent to 10 per cent in September, 1977 also remained unchanged during the year. Although no change was recorded in the rate on interbank call loans too, there were indications of increased pressure in this market during the second half of the year,driving the operative rate towards the maximum of 9\u00b75 per cent.",

Following the pattern of the previous year, the rise was more marked in foreign assets. In all, the fo:oeign assets (International Reserve) of the Bank increased by Rs. 1,806 million, while domestic assets rose by Rs. 905 million. The major part of the increase in the International Reserve during the year arose from the transactions with the International Monetary Fund. While there was a net drawing of Rs. 348 million during the year, a sum of Rs. 778 million was also received in respeat of the Trust Fund loan. These, together with long-term capital flows in excess of the current account deficit in the balance of payments resulted in a consider-able rise in the foreign assets of the Bank during the year.",

Considered against the sharp increase in foreign assets of the Bank during the year, this reduction in foreign liabilities, though small, would further .amplify the <;ountry's strong balance of payments position which emerged during the year. All in all, the growth pattorn of Central Bank's assets and liabilities during 1978 indicates that oniy a smaller share of the increase in assets had been acquired in exchange for the Bank's own liabilities while the major share had been financed with liabilities accepted on behalf of others. This would mean that the ex'pansionary impulse resulting from the growth of the Bank's assets was considerably lowe~ than: what is 'indicated by the total growth in assets.",

    "text": "During 1978 there were no major changes either by way of intensification or relaxation of the above monetary policy package. On March 27, 1978 the restriction on commercial bimk credit to non-bank companies engaged in the business of lending money or hire purchase activities was relaxed to exclude credit granted for financing capital equipment and new commercial vehicles. From June, 1978 an attempt was made to restrict commercial bank credit ,to government corporations and statutory boards, by way of an overall ceiling on such credit at the level outstanding as on June 28, 1978. This, however,gave rise to certain difficulties and the ceiling had to be modified on a number of occasions to accommodate increased credit requirements of these institutions. This ceiling waS raised by 5 per cent from July 13 and' by 12 per cent from August 7, making a total of 17 per cent by which'commercial bank advances to government corporations and statutory boards (other than finance and lending institutions), could be increased over the level of such advances as at June 28,",

    "text": "As discussed previously, the year 1978 witnessed a substantial moderation in the rate of monetary expansion in Sri Lanka. The annual rate of monetary expansion declined from 35 per cent in January, 1978 to as low as 11 per cent by December, 1978. There is evidence to show that the tight monetary policy pursued during the year helped in no small way towards moderating the rate of monetary expansion. Although government financial operations had been the major underlying factor for the deceleration in the monetary expansion, a subs. tantial build up of time and savings deposits by the non-bank private sector with the banking system had also been a very significan t factor contributing to this development. In all, time and savings deposita of the non-bank private sector with commercial banks rose by Rs. 1,605 million during the year. This enabled tne commercial banks to accommodate the sharply increased credit requirements of the private sector without generating undue inflationary pressures. Thus, despite the record increase in bank credit to private sector during the year amounting to Rs. 3,026 million, the expansionary impact of this sector's operations was contained at Rs. 688 million. Also, the monetary measures such as the with. drawal of the till-cash concession enabled the Central Bank to impound a",

The rationale for the. 1977 monetary policy package and its continuance' throughout 1978 have to be viewed against this background. There were occasional complaints of both non-availability of and high cost of credit. The former could arise from the credit conttols that were in force,. but the substantial credit expansion. during 1978 indicated that the banking system was able to meet the emerging higher credit needs of the economy~ Complaints regarding high cost of credit appear to be the reaction of those who had got accustomed\u00b7 to low cost credit over a long period 'of time.- In the background of persistent two-digit inflation since 1976, it is inconceivable how cheap money policies could be adopted without seriously . affecting savings incentives and resource mobilization.
