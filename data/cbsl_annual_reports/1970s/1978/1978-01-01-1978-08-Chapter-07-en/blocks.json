    "text": "Money wages of workers in the private sector who are covered by Wages Boards, as measured by the Labour Department's Index, showed a higher rate of increase in 1978. Wages of workers in agriculture rose by 45 per cent, while workers in industry and commerce saw their wages rise by 24 per cent. The corresponding increases in 1977 were 25 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. Discounting for inflation, it appears that the real wages rose in this sector. Factors contributing to this were the extension of the pay rise granted to government employees in December, 1977 to the private sector, the increase in the cost of living allowance corresponding to the rise in the Colombo Consumers' Cost of Living Index, the grant of a price-related wage supplement in tea and rubber plantations.",

    "text": "It should be noted, however, that the available wage indices reflect minimum wages of representative grades and that they do not reflect additional emoluments such as overtime payments, increments, bonuses and other incentive payments. There is some evidence that, faced with declining real wages, employees in public as well as private sectors have tended to supplement their nominal incomes by needless 'overtime' work beyond normal hours and by engaging in part-time private vocations, which is reflected by the high degree of absenteeism in normal work places. This is inevitable in situations where inflation is allowed to erode money incomes. Relating wages to productivity and judicious com\u00adpensation for inflation are more appropriate remedies for this problem than attempts to eradicate such activity by fiat.",
