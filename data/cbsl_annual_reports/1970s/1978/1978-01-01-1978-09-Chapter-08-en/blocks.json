    "text": "The 1977 economic reforms had a greater and more immediate impact on imports than on exports. A high rate of increase in imports would normally be expected following upon many years of licensing and controls, despite the higher cost of importation. In the case of exports, however, increases could only be expected in the medium and long term because of supply inelasticities in the short-run. Exports would normally be expected to rise after the lapse of some\u00adtime on account of the incentive extended by the depreciated exchange rate, especially in view of the fact that prior to the change, the three major traditional exports were not entitled to the premium exchange rate. However, a high percentage of the profits which would normally have accrued to producers of tea, rubber and coconut as a result of this exercise were siphoned off by the government. The export duties on tea, rubber and coconut were revised upward, thereby eroding producer margins at a time when costs of production were rising. Hence, as mentioned last year, the question of incentive for these major industries is of utmost importance and it is necessary to keep these taxes under constant review in order to ensure the viability of these major sectors of the economy.",

The quantity of tea exports rose by 7 million kilos despite a drop in production. Although interna\u00adtional tea prices fell from the peak levels of 1977, they have been rising during the past few years and the levels in 1978 have been well above those of 1976. It is, therefore, a matter for serious concern that Sri Lanka is the only major producing country in which tea production has been falling over the last decade. In fact, Sri Lanka has yet to exceed the production peak reached 14 years ago in 1965. Duties, taxes and other charges presently constitute as much as around 56 per cent of the export price of tea and this appears to be a serious constraint to increasing production.",

There was a sharp acceleration of investment goods imports reflecting the increase in the economy's growth rate.

The upsmge in capital goods imports is an indi\u00adcation of a greater momentum in the future growth of the economy since such goods are generally influenced by long term considerations. The volume of intermediate goods imports appear to have risen by 10 per cent; and that of consumer goods, appear to have fallen purely because of a drop in rice imports which had more than offset an increase in other imports. Analysing SDR denominated trade data, the share of capital goods in total imports rose from 12 per cent in 1977 to 23 per cent in 1978 while the shares of intermediate goods",

Duties were raised, sometimes to penal levels, on luxury consumer goods. For instances, duties on items such as perfumes, carpets and cigarettes were raised to 500 per cent in January. There were duty reductions on some consumer goods, such as condesned milk, infant and invalid milk food, frozen meat, biscuits, vegetable protein and yeast. Duties were also reduced on a number of intermediate goods such as barbed wire, articles of iron and steel, fertilizer and pesticides; as well as on capital goods such as engines and chassis for heavy diesel vehicles, roofing tiles and asbestos sheets.",

The immediate impact of these measures on the balance of payments was perceptible in 1978, when the current account shifted back to a deficit of Rs. 782 million (SDR 64 million) from a surplus of Rs 1,266 million (SDR 116 million) in 1977. External assets, however, increased further in 1978 and the end year reserves were sufficient to finance four months' imports anticipated for 1979. The growth in external assets arose from the surplus in the capital account generated by a heavy inflow of long-term capital and by drawings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",

    "text": "The impact of the exchange and trade liberalization on balance of payments was felt critically in the field of imports. In SDR terms,2 payments on imports rose by 30 per cent; the import bill increased from Rs. 6,290 million (SDR 622 million) in 1977 to Rs. 15,350 million (SDR 808 million) in 1978. The increase in imports reflected the release of the pent-up demand built up over the years of controls. The rise in imports stemmed mainly from a speeding up of imports of investment and intermediate goods, while imports of consumer goods rose at a lower pace. A more than twofold increase in the import of capital goods in 1978 was partly a reflection of the bottlenecks that existed in domestic industries for a number of years, and partly a result of increased indust\u00adrial activity. While the foreign exchange resource constraints and stringent import controls In the past served to limit the utilisation of external resources to certain essential imports, they inhibited the inflow of investment goods",
