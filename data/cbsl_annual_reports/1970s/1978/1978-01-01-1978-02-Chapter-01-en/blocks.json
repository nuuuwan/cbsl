    "text": "Sri Lanka's terms of trade which improved successively in two preceding years, declined marginally in 1978, primarily on account of a fall in tea prices and an increase in import prices. Exports were moderately higher, but imports were substantially higher than in 1977. Thus, the modest trade surplus of 1977 turned, as anticipated, into a substantial deficit in 1978. Consequently, the current account of the balance of payments too turned from a surplus to a deficit. However, substantial capital inflows, together with resources from the International Monttary Fund, went on to create a favourable overall balance in Sri Lanka's payments, augmenting the external assets for the third year in succession, to a level that would normally be adequate to meet four months' imports projected for 1979.",

This development, combined with the stringent monetary policies that were continued during 1978, helped to contain the expansion in money supply to 11 per cent, in contrast to increases of 29 and 35 per cent in the two previous years. These factors, along with the substantial growth in output,, helped to contain inflationary pressures in the economy at a level lower than in the previ\u00adous year. Real wages outside the public sector grew in 1978. Also, the revival of economic activity seems to have made some dent in the growing problem of unemployment.",

The then prevailing multiple exchange rate system was unified and the Rupee was allowed to float. This enabled the relaxing of, most trade and payments controls; and a shift from quantitative restrictions to tariffs as a means of protecting domestic enterprise.",

Paddy production which rose by 34 per cent last year, progressed further by 13 per cent to an all-time high of 91 million bushels in 1978, permitting a sharp reduction in rice imports. The Maha and Yala season peaks of 1977 were exceeded by 12 and 13 per cent, respectively largely on account of favourable weather, increased fertilizer use, more credit and a higher guaranteed price. Tea production which recovered last year declined by 5 per cent. Rubber production which dropped last year by 4 per cent rose by 7 per cent in a climate of buoyant prices. Coconut production too rose by 21 per cent, on account of more favourable weather in the past year which induced a greater use of fertilizer. Traditional minor export crops fared unevenly, while subsidiary food crops declined. Fishery appears to have progressed somewhat while the livestock industry suffered a setback. On the whole, 1978 was an uneven year for agriculture.",

Rejuvenation of this sector should be given high priority in the new economic policies. A greater dynamism in this field is essential to generate and harness resources to sustain the far reaching economic reforms, including trade liberalization, during the coming period of economic transformation, and to service repayments of debts contracted now, in the not so distant future. This sector is also critically important in generating adequate revenue to maintain public investment at a high level. Furthermore, a major part of the export-led growth impulse could be expected from export agriculture, whose potential is yet considerable. Hence, adequacy of producer margins, especially in relation to export taxation, trends in cost of production, and the need for continuation of market controls, are matters that deserve close examination.",

It appears that the continued availability of heavily subsidized flour could dampen greater import substitution in subsidiary food crops. Also, if the operation of \"buffer stock'' schemes, meant essentially to even out seasonal fluctuations in prices, are permitted to overly depress producer prices to uneconomic levels, a similar adverse impact on domestic production could occur. Needless to say, there has to be a trade-off between the conflicting requirements of consumers and producers.",

    "text": "The stagnant industry of Sri Lanka received a boost by the import liberalization. Value of output in the factory and small industry sector has been estimated to have grown by 11 per cent in 1978, the private sector growing marginally higher than the public sector. Basic metals, Textiles, Non-Metallic Minerals, Paper and Chemicals were the main growth sectors. In textiles, the growth of the larger firms appears to have more than compensated a decline in the smaller, but this could have had adverse effects on employment in this sector. More than the import liberalization per se it appears that the pricing policy on textiles, where an attempt is made to keep prices of popular textiles low by government imports at lower tariffs, has caused (this problem. Some industries such as food, metal product and machinery appeared to be unable to compete with imports, despite substantial tariff protection Therefore, time is opportune now for a full reappraisal of industrial policy. There is no economic sense in continuously protecting basically inefficient industries. An export-orien\u00adted industrial policy envisaged now would require the active fostering of a highly efficient and internationally competitive industry. On the other hand, there was a dynamic response by the public sector industries at the outset, but this appears to have waned somewhat with the passage of time. It appears that some public industries yet continue to enjoy monopoly power, as in Cement and Ceramics, sometimes even in trading activities, as in the case of import of caustic soda by the Paranthan Chemicals Corporation. The need for continuance of such monopolies may be reviewed, with a view to assessing any gains that could result from increased competition. Also, there appears to be a need for greater autonomy in pricing and production policies in public sector industries.",

    "text": "The transport and communications sector in the country has clearly lagged behind in recent times. In nationalized public road passenger transport, the operated mileage has been 18 per cent lower than the required mileage, and despite an increase in bus fares in 1978, the financial position of the composite organization in charge, does not appear to have improved further. A decentra\u00adlization of the organization does not seem to have helped to improve the services. The government has contemplated the supplementing of existing services by private transport services in certain selected sub-urban routes. But inadequacy of service has been found mostly in the case of urban commuter traffic, where the service has not kept up to meet a rapidly growing demand. The nationalized service has not been able to meet the growing demand largely because of inadequate investment, due to continuing operational deficits arising from the low fares system that has been operative. On the other hand, available data suggest the continuous deterioration of the railway service. In the context of rising oil prices, and the growing demand for public transport arising from increased economic activity, a much greater investment in public transport, a rationalization of the fares structure, and better management are of vital importance. In road haulage, however, the import liberalization resulted in the registration of 4,874 lorries and vans in 1978, which was more than twice",

Surplus on services declined on account of higher expenditures on foreign travel for business, education, export promotion and other purposes, but net transfers showed an appreciable rise because of a sharp increase in remittances by Sri Lankans working abroad. Thus, the current account of the balance of payments showed a deficit of Rs. 782 million (SDR 64 million) which compares with the surplus of Rs. 1,266 million (SDR 116 million) last year. However, a large increase in net capital inflows - from Rs. 563 million (SDR 54 million) to Rs. 2,640 million (SDR 135 million) - more than offset the current deficit; and went on to augment external assets by Rs. 1,904 million (SDR 65 million) at the end of the year.",

    "text": "As in the previous year, external banking assets rose, owing to the ovreall surplus in the balance of payments; but the expansionary impact of this development on the economy was considerably moderated by the contractionary impact of the government sector. As a result, the increase in money supply during 1978 was kept down to a relatively tolerable level of 11 per cent, which was in sharp contrast to increases of 29 and 35 per cent in the two pre\u00advious years. The stringent monetary policies involving restraint on credit expansion to the private sector and high short-term interest rates were continued during 1978 and were reinforced by a ceiling on lending to public corporations. Thus, had it not been for the monetary and fiscal restraint that was enforced during 1978, restoration of economic stability in the country, which is essential for economic growth, would not have been realized. There were some complaints of the high cost of credit, but the monetary policy adopted should be viewed as a short-term anti-inflationary measure aimed at restoring monetary stability after two successive years of rapid expansion. It is essential for an expanding economy to pay a positive real rate of interest on savings. In other words, if adequate resources for development are to be generated, savers should be paid a return (which is the rate of interest) which is higher than the expected (or at least, the current) rate of inflation. With inflation running at around 15 per cent, a return to the cheap money policies of yesteryear will be clearly counter\u00adproductive. The very high demand for credit in 1978 indicated that borrowers have not been baulked by the current level of interest rates. Of course, it is possible that the long-term investor could be discouraged somewhat by high interest fates. It was for this reason that the rates of the long-term lending institutions were left virtually unaffected by the interest rate reform of 1977. It appears that there was an inadequacy of long-term capital. The new National Development Bank, which will commence operations in 1979, is expected to fill this vacuum, largely.",

The anticipated surplus, however, could not be generated, there being a deficit of Rs. 701 million in the current account. Fiscal operations in 1978 revealed an expansionary impact of Rs.173 million, which was quite contrary to the picture presented by the monetary and banking data, of a contractionary impact of Rs. 1,500 million. This was largely due to certain financial transfers effected at the end of the year and an unusually high float of uncleared cheques. When the necessary adjustments are made, the budgetary operations during 1978 would show a contractionary impact of Rs. 893 million. The under-utilization of capital votes declined from 27 per cent in 1977 to 16 per cent in 1978- The contemplated acceleration of government activity from 1979 onwards would necessitate an even better utilization of capital votes.",

    "text": "As mentioned last year, 1977 was a clear watershed in the economic history of Sri Lanka, when the country turned away from a predominantly inward looking, tightly controlled and welfare oriented strategy to one which primarily emphasized export growth, competition and higher capital investment for economic growth and employment generation. The year 1978 was the first full year under the new economic regime, and several problems in adjusting from a controlled regime to a liberalized one were evident. But, the spontaneous and immediate response of the economy to the new economic policy in achieving a high growth rate was the most encouraging feature of 1978. The slow overall growth of exports was partly due to the setback suffered by the tea industry and partly to the normal time lags in the response of exports to the new incentives, Nevertheless, in the traditional sector where price incentives have been reduced to siphon off windfall gains, a review of policies may be necessary to induce a quicker positive response, especially in tea, coconut and minor export crops.",

A difficult trade-off between the interests of consumers and producers would be required. Remaining monopolistic powers and non-productive controls would have to be whittled down.
