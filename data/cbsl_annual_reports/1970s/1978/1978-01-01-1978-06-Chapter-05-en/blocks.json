A survey has revealed that over 80 per cent of manufacturing industry accounting for 90 per cent of the value of production and 81 per cent of the workforce was located in the Colombo district. Several fiscal and other concessions are contemplated to foster a more balanced regional dispersal of industry. But modern industry tends to be footloose; and for such industries the contemplated concessions could be only marginal. Hence it might be advisable to foster regional dispersal of industries by setting up regional industrial centres, with the necessary infrastructure to attract investment outside the Colombo district.",

    "text": "These indicators show that the rate of inflation in the economy in 1978 would have been between 15 to 16 per cent, a rate lower than that indicated in the previous year of 16 to 20 per cent.1 This shows that the upward pressure exerted on prices by the substantial depreciation of the exchange rate, the removal of price controls on a large number of consumer items in November 1977, the increase in wages of both private and public sector employees in December 1977, the removal of rice and sugar subsidies from a large proportion of households in 1978 and the upward revision of the price of wheat flour in three stages in 1978 was more than offset by other factors. These other factors included the increased supply of imported goods after liberalization, more competition in the import and distribution trade, improvements in transport facilities due to a substantial increase in the number of commercial vehicles, particularly lorries, higher production of major consumer goods, particularly rice, lowering of business turnover tax and the import duty on many items and the relatively moderate increase in the money supply (11 per cent as against an increase of 29 per cent in the previous year). Nevertheless, a two-digit rate of inflation should not be a cause for satisfaction, because containing cost escalations should be a primary objective of an economy hoping to achieve export-led economic,growth. Needless to say, a country has to remain competitive in international markets if it were to make a breakthrough on the export front.",

The sugar ration was limited to children within this group. As a result, a large portion of the rice trade came suddenly on the free market, which proved to be a highly efficient one. Price of rice in this market tended to stabilize around Rs. 2.90 to Rs. 3.20 for average quality.",

Similarly, wages of minor employees rose by 16 per cent and that of school teachers, by 10 per cent, as compared with increases of 2 per cent each in the previous year. The major reason for this increase in money wage rates was the pay rise granted to government employees in December, 1977. Although money wages showed a substantial increase over the previous year, they remained constant through\u00adout 1978. A more substantial wage increase was announced in November, 1978 but this would come into effect only in 1979- Allowing for the rate of inflation in the economy, real wages in this sector appear to have declined, except in the case of minor employees.",
