The objective of this rationalisation was to reduce operational cost and increase functional efficiency. There is evidence that, wherever the ultimate ownership of land was subject to uncertainty, the necessary development work got deferred. Perhaps, these changes were necessary; but it resulted in a certain amount of dislocation. The regional organisations of the two institutions were finalised, but the emoluments and incentive payments at higher management levels in the plantation sector remained unresolved.",

Despite the enhanced subsidies that were payable for re-planting of tea, rubber and coconut, the re-planting achievements continued to be well below the desired levels. The profit sqeeze in tea, a shortage of planting material in tea, rubber and coconut, and the continued unattractiveness of re\u00adplanting subsidies (which in most cases did not compensate the loss of income of the producer during the gestation period) appeared to dampen the re-planting effort. A more comprehensive subsidy scheme to encourage re-planting and new planting in minor export crops was also introduced. The fertilizer subsidies were revised several times during the year; and ultimately a uniform subsidy of 50 per cent of the import price was introduced in November, 1978. Continuing the import liberalisation policy of the government, the import monopoly of the Fertilizer Corporation was abolished.",

But, the storage capacity of the Board did not increase'adequately to meet the higher intake and substantial stocks had to be stored in open-air, under tarpaulin. At the outset, the Board was unable to meet the full requirements of the Food Commissioner owing to milling const\u00adraints. Later the Food Commissioner had to curtail his purchases from the Board on account of high stocks. This compounded the storage problems of the Board From May, it was decided to issue paddy as well on the ration. The paddy issues became quite popular and eased the storage and milling problems of the Board, to some extent. The withdrawal of the rice-subsidy and rationed issues from nearly one half of the population led to the growth of a dynamic private trade in paddy and rice. The outmoded rice milling industry improved during the year due to the import liberalisation, and was able to meet the sudden expansion of the private market for rice.",

With regard to rationed food items, the Food Commissioner made rice available in the free market through co-operatives at a price of Rs. 1-45 per pound. This price was roughly commensurate with the payment of Rs. 40 per bushel to the farmer and for processing and distribution. Although the consumer preference for this rice was low, the availability of such icre helped to stabilise the price of rice in the free market. The price of flour was raised, in three stages, from 60 cents to Rs. 1 \u2022 12 per pound. This price was yet well below world prices. The liberal availability of flour at this subsidised price probably discouraged the growth of subsidiary food crops. The price of sugar remained unchanged at Rs. 3 per pound, which was above world prices; neverthe\u00adless, it appears to have had adverse effects on the cane and jaggery industry. The Government also built up buffer stocks of certain agricultural produce with",

    "text": "pronounced seasonality in production, with a view to stabilising prices. To the extent that such buffer stocks are built from domestic produce, the producers and consumers would stand to benefit by a moderation of seasonal price fluctuations. But, wherever imports are made to supplement domestic supplies, prices would tend to get stabilised at a lower level, with an adverse impact on production. Among the imports made for stabilisation of prices were onions, chillies, potatoes, fish and chicken. There were also some imports of dhal and green gram. It is quite possible that the drop in domestic production of onions, chillies, potatoes, green gram and cow-pea was, at least partly, due to this import policy. It is noteworthy, however, that the Government allowed a considerable profit margin to the domestic producer in releasing these imports in the market. Hence, it is likely that only those producers who had been accustomed to subs\u00adtantial profit margins would have been discouraged by this policy. It is also possible that some producers shifted back to paddy cultivation because of a more attractive return under very favourable conditions for paddy that existed in 1978. In the coconut industry, a complicated export taxing and profit regulatio-nary measure was introduced in 1978. The aim of this regulation was to keep prices at a reasonable level to the consumer and to assure the producer a price of 65 cents per nut, later enhanced to 85 cents per nut.",

    "text": "In evaluating \"the'dbappolh^ihg^pnformarice of the tea industry in 1978, cognizance must be made of the important fact that tea prices rose to unprecedented levels in 1977, inducing a positive response from producers at a time when the climatic conditions were quite favourable. In 1978, however, prices declined considerably. London prices of Sri Lanka teas during 1978 were, on the average, 44 per cent lower than in 1977. In fact they were almost half of the peak prices realised in early 1977. Colombo prices too were, on the average, 13 per cent lower than in 1977. Also, the changeover in the basis of taxation of the tea industry effected in November, 1977 had an adverse effect on the industry when faced with declining prices. Prior to the change, the taxation was based on a nominal export duty and a substantial .value-based progressive sliding-scale excise based on auction prices. This was changed to a substantial specific export duty and relatively minor value-based tax at the auction level. Undoubtedly, this was the more convenient way of siphoning off the windfall gains- accruing to the industry as a-result of the 1977 exchange reform. But, with the decline in prices, the specific tax burden became heavier; and no adjustments were made in the specific export duty. As a result, the net producer prices in 1978 tended to be much lower than in 1977 . On the other hand, cost of production (without reckoning the cost of additional labour required for replanting) has been estimated to have risen by about 30 per cent in 1978. Thus, declining income and rising cost had squeezed the industry in a scissor-grip and had seriously eroded producer margins in 1978.",

Faced with the erosion of prof it margins, producers have always tended to neglect recommended cultural practices in order to reduce costs, but this in turn depressed production in the future. In fact, the two laTge state land management institutions - the State Plantations Corporation and the Janatha Estates Development Board \u2014which managed most of the lands vested in the State since the land reforms of 1972 and 1975, appeared to have managed to maintain their 1977 levels of pro\u00adduction in 1978.

In that context, the performance of these two institutions in 1978 could be deemed as disappointing. However, there were extenuating circumstances. There was some disruption caused by the transfer of land which once belonged to the Janawasa Commission to these institutions and the rationalisation of land distribution between the two major organizations undertaken during 1978. Yet, these institutional changes could have favourable effects on productions in the years to come. Also, in the case of fertilizer subsidies, the government adopted a discriminatory policy towards the state institution, in that they were entitled only to one-half of the subsidy that was granted to the private land owners during the major part of 1978. Apparently, the government felt that financial viability in their operations was not that important as they were state institutions. But, the fact remains that such decisions imposed considerable liquidity constraints on these institutions; and the erosion of profit margins may have affected incentives among estate management.",

The prices of competitive synthetic rubber, which is a product of petro-chemical industry, are certain to move up appreciably Moreover, prospects for. international co-operation among primary producers appear to be brightest in the case of rubber. Hence, a more concerted effort is required to increase rubber production and reap the benefits from the favourable price situation. Even.a doubling^of the current replanting rate cannot be deemed to be excessive. In fact, the uprooted rubber trees could be an important source of firewood, where supplies appear to be dwindling. T o achieve the replanting target and to clear the accumulated replanting deficit, a substantial increase in the subsidy may be required. Improved facilities to the smallholder will also help to upgrade the quality of rubber, the price premium for better quality being considerable.",

On the one hand, coconut forms an important part of indigenous diet and successive governments have endeavoured to keep prices low. On the other hand, coconut cultivation as a mono-crop requires little attention (for example, when compared to tea or rubber) and thus had become a pastime of the traditional absentee land-owner, whose main source of income comes from elsewhere, and who was, therefore, not overly concerned with a high and adequate return on his investment. Virtually no new investment has taken place in the processing industry in recent times, on grounds that there was over-capacity. In other words, the industry displayed the usual signs of a stagnant or declining industry. When consumption rose or when production declined, governments were quite keen to curtail exports with a view to maintaining low consumer prices.",

These rates were again changed to 25 per cent and 50 per cent for the public sector and private sector, respectively from 1st July, 1978. The new higher prices appeared to be a disincentive for wider fertilizer use. Also, the Government had decided to do away with the monopoly of imports by the Fertilizer Corporation, but this could not be implemented as long as the subsidized fertilizer prices were determined according to the Corporation's selling prices. Hence, on November 21, 1978 a uniform subsidy of 50 per cent of the import (C St F) price of fertilizer was announced. At the same time, the Customs duty of 12J per cent and the Business Turnover Tax on fertilizer were also abolished. Along with these measures, prices of fertilizer were reduced by 5 to 10 per cent, but they were higher than the prices at the beginning of the year.",

The shortfall in production as well as in collections may be explained mainly in terms of low producer margins resulting from high cost of animal feed. Perhaps, increased slaughter of animals due to high prices of beef may also have had some adverse impact on milk production.

    "text": "This remarkable and unprecedented spurt of industry in 1978 could be described as the spontaneous reaction of domestic industry to its emancipation from the straitjacket of controls after the re-orientation of economic policies in 1977. Liberalization of imports made raw materials and spares easily available. As a result, inventories could be scaled down, and capacities utilized to a greater extent. Limited competition from imports necessitated the up-grading of quality In a competitive environment. It appears that certain industries were so inefficient that they were unable to compete even under substantial import protection and were driven to the wall, but it is worth examining whether such industries should be protected and nurtured for ever at a high social and economic cost. The high employment oriented handloom textile industries were faced with a critical challenge from superior and highly competitive textile imports, arising largely from the decision to supply the domestic market with cheap and better textiles by administrative waiver of protective tariffs. It appears that continued sudsidization of employment in the handloom industry at the expense of the consumer may be counter productive in the long run, as it encourages a low level of efficiency. It might be preferable to improve the technology and the quality with a view to catering to the high quality international markets.",

    "text": "It appears that both public and private sector industries grew substantially in 1978. In current value terms, private sector industrial output expanded by 30 per cent, while the public sector output rose by 26 per cent. Capacity utilization which was about 61 per cent last year, rose to 70 per cent in 1978. Employment in industry has grown by about 15 per cent, private sector employment rising by 17 per cent, and public sector employment by 13 per cent. The usage of imported raw materials in industry rose from 66 per cent in 1977 to 79 per cent in 1978. This was an inevitable short-term development of the freeing of the bulk of raw materials from import licensing. Hereafter, import tariffs and not quantitative restrictions, will have to be used in encouraging the substitution of imports by domestic raw materials, wherever comparative advantages exists.",
