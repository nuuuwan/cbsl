Survey on Finance Management

The Department also carried out a survey on "Finance Management in Small Scale Industries" in 1978. The primary ' objectives of the survey was to identify the financing problems of the small sector from the initial as well as post-financing stages and to ascertain the training needs in this area.. Thirty firms with an investment of Rs. 500,000 or less in plant and machinery were selected for the survey. The survey brought'out two important facts:

( 90 )

(a) None of the firms in the sample had recourse to bank finance at the initial stage though on becoming successful some had been able to obtain limited facilities from banks. This limited access to bank credit would seem to be a reflection of the conservative, security-oriented lending policies of banks.

(b) None of the small industrialists in the sample thought that there was a need for training in finance management. This may be partly due to the fact that there was no necessity to improve finance management as there had been only a marginal expansion in the scale of operations of the small industrialists during the period. There was some reason to think, however, that their lack of knowledge in finance management was one of the reasons that made it more difficult for them to obtain bank finance.

Survey of Sugar Cane Loans

At the request of the Ministry of Plan Implementation and the Committee of Development Secretaries, this Department in collaboration with the People's Bank, the Bank of Ceylon, and the Ministry of Agriculture, undertook a survey of sugar cane loans given in the Amparai District with a view to determining the extent of mis-utilisation of loans. The results of this survey have been published by the Ministry of Plan Implementation.

National Development Bank

The Department also undertook the appraisal of several public sector projects referred to it by the Development Secretaries Committee under an arrangement made with the Central Bank by the Ministry of Finance and Planning. Under this arrangement Rs. 390 million earmarked in the 1978 Budget as the government's capital contribution to the National Development Bank was lodged with the Central Bank and disbursements out of this fund for capital expenditure by public sector corporations was made subject to an appraisal by this Department.

Draft proposals for Legislation for the establishment of the National Development Bank which was passed in November, 1978 was prepared by this Department during the year under review.

The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Ceylon, throu&h its Employees' Provident Fund Department, continued to receive all sums paid under the Employees' Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 as contributions and surcharges and other income from the investment of moneys of the Fund and to perform its other functions in respect of these moneys in terms of Section 5 of the Act. A brief note on its operations during the year 1978 is given below.

Membership and Registered Employments

According to data furnished by the Department of Labour the number of registered employments increased from 81,959 in 1977 to 85,656 in 1978, an increase of 4-5 per cent. The number of members registered under these employ­ments amounted to 1,386,591 as at end of 1978, as against a membership of 1,344,528 in 1977, an increase of 3-1 per cent.

Contributions

The contributions received by the Fund during the year amounted to Rs. 524 million, as against Rs. 305 million in 1977. This represents an increase of Rs. 219 million or 72 per cent over the level of contributions made during the previous year.

Members' balances as at end of 1978 stood at Rs. 3,263 million, which is an increase of Rs. 687 million or 27 per cent oyer the level of 1977.

Investments

During 197.8, the Fund invested a sum of Rs. 642 million in Government Securities. This was an increase of Rs. 244 million or 61 per cent over that of 1977. The total investments of the Fund as at end'of 1978 were Rs. 3,133 million, as against Rs. 2,491 million in 1977.

Income from Investments

In 1978, the income from investments amounted'to Rs. 206 million, as against Rs. 160 million in 1977. This represents an increase of Rs: 46 miilio:i or 29 per cent, as against an increase of Rs. 28 million or 21 per cent in the previous year. This, of course, is due to investment of the increased volume of contribu­tions received as well as re-investment of income earned on past investments.

Refunds

The total amount paid out by way of refund of benefits in 1978 amounted to Rs. 122 million. This represents an increase of Rs. 33 million as compared with 1977. The number of refunds made in 1978 was 42,526.as against 41 j 157 in 1977. . . , . - . '

( 97 )

Interest on Members' Balances

The Employees' Provident Fund is required to pay interest on. members' balances out of the income from its investments. The rate of interest payable on members' balances continued to be 7*5 per cent per annum. The interest payable a9 at the end of 1978 amounted to Rs. 228 million, as against Rs. 180 million in 1977. This records an increase of Rs. 48 million or 27 per cent over the previous year.

Interest is paid on the balances standing to the credit of members at the end of the year and thereafter, interest accumulates on that aggregate sum. Thus members earn a compound rate of interest. Besides, interest is paid for the entire year on the balance standing to the member's credit at the end of the year irrespective of the date when any portion of that balance (which represents cont­ributions), was received by the fund to the member's account, e.g. a contribution received in December gets interest for the full year in the same way as a contri­bution received in January of that year. The effective rate of interest which a member earns is, therefore, somewhat higher than 7 • 5 per cent.

STATISTICS

An extensive programme of data collection was inaugurated in 1978. The decennial Consumer Finance Survey was redesigned to cover a wide range of socio-economic data and a decision was taken to conduct the survey every five years. In order to monitor the prices in all parts of the country, an all island data collection scheme was initiated to collect data from 100 different centres covering all districts in the country. The extended data collection programme also included the monitoring of the import liberalisation programme of the Government and the documentation of a wide range of statistics relating to the economy.

The Consumer Finance and Socio-Economic Survey 1978-1979

In 1953 the Central bank conducted the first of a series of Consumer Finance Surveys. This was followed by similar surveys in 1963 and 1973. The main purpose of these surveys was to obtain information on the household consumption pattern, the sources of their income and the relationship of income to investment and indebtedness. Supplementary data on employment and other demographic variables were also collected.

Because of the rapidly changing structure of the consumption patterns and income distribution of households in recent years the Central Bank decided to conduct Consumer Finance Surveys at five year intervals. A sample survey to obtain information on similar lines as in former consumer finance surveys was planned in early 1978. Later in the year, due to the urgent need of upto-date data on a wide range of socio-economic variables for the development plans of the Government, it was decided to widen the scope and subject coverage of the survey. Thus a new sample survey designated "Consumer Finance and Socio-Economic Survey 1978-79" was designed to meet these needs. Field investigation of Round 1 out of four rounds of the survey was completed during the last quarter of 1978. The results of this round are expected to be available by the middle of 1979.

( 98 )

The survey will cover a sample of 8,000 households drawn from rural, urban and estate sectors. Unlike the previous surveys, it was proposed to conduct the present survey in four rounds spread over a period of one year and in each round, a sample of 2,000 households would be enumerated. The collec­tion of data in four rounds will serve a dual purpose. First, it will help to show Up the seasonal. variations of the socio-economic variables under study. Secondly, overall estimates will incorporate seasonal variation.

Private Investment in Sri Lanka

The scope and coverage of this survey was reported in detail in the 1977 Review of the Economy. The field work involved in the household sector was completed in 1977, while the field investigation in the fishing sector was carried out during the period 27th March, 1978 to 10th July, 1978- As the non-response of the business sector to the postal questionnaire was very high, a follow up of this sector by personal interview was done during the period 16th August, 1978 to 3rd September, 1978. The processing of data and writing of the report will continue up to the end of 1979.

Monitoring of the Import Liberalization Programme

In order to monitor the import liberalization programme and to forecast the import bill for future periods, a system of data collection was introduced to obtain data from the commercial banks on the letters of credit opened, the modifications of the letters of credit and bills received against letters of credit. The data is tabulated as follows :-

Values of letters of credit classified by four digit BTN numbers. A further detailed breakdown of values of letters of credit classified by type of importation. Values of letters of credit classified on the basis of Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 291/7 of 15th November, 1977. Values of letters of credit outstanding. In this table, information relating to the letters of credit actually utilised is also given.

Country wide Data Collection System

A country wide data collection system was launched in 1978. In the experimental stage, the following information is being collected periodically from hundred locations scattered throughout the country:-

(a) Retail prices of consumer goods and their availability.

(b) Producer prices of agricultural products.

(c) Wage rates and availability of labour in paddy farming, small holdings of the tea, rubber and coconut and the construction industry. (d) Cost and availability of agricultural products.

(e) Marketing facilities of major agricultural products.

Depending on the importance of economic variables, the data collection is done weekly,, fortnightly and monthly. The data collected under this scheme ate used for the following purposes :-

(a) (b)

(c)

(d)

( 99 )

(a) The information pertaining to the availability of consumer items and agricultural inputs are made available periodically to the ministries concerned in order to facilitate short term policy decisions to improve the distribution of these commodities.

(b) The data on consumer prices and the prices of agricultural inputs are used to identify the differences in prices between areas and their periodic fluctuations. Arrangements are also made to compute a retail price index for the whole island and separate indices for each district and area.

(c) Producer prices of agricultural products are used to measure the differences in the retail prices of the commodities and their producer prices. This information helps to identify the magnitude of trade margins kept by the distributors. A comparison of producer prices between the respective producing areas is also made to identify the reasons for such differences.

(d) The data on wage rates prevailing in the sectors mentioned above are used for purposes such as preparing wage rate indices to trace the periodic fluctuations in them, differences in wage rates between areas and activities and to compare them with the wage rates in other sectors which are guided by minimum wage legislation and the Wages Boards Ordinance. Information on the availability of labour may help to encourage migration of labour from areas where there is a surplus to areas where labour is scarce. This information also helps to identify the trades where training of new skills is necessary.

(e) The information on marketing facilities is used to locate the areas where marketing facilities are not adequate. Such information is made available to the respective ministries to take short term policy decis­ions to improve the marketing facilities in the relevant areas.
