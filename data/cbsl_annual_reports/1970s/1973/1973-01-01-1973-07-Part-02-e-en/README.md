(E) M O N E T A R Y A N D BANKING DEVELOPMENTS

Due to a strike by commercial bank employees in the last quarter of 1972, monetary and banking data for that period as well as for early 1973, contain dis­tortions and this precludes a meaningful analysis of monetary developments in the calender year 1973 in comparison with the preceding year. Even after the strike had ended there were distortions in the data for the first few months of 1973.

For the purpose of a meaningful analysis of the monetary developments in the period from end-August, 1972 to end-December, 1973 it is considered best to break this period into two sub-periods. The first sub period covers the twelve months ending in August, 1973 and is compared with the corresponding period in 1972, which is free of distortions arising from the strike. The second sub-period covers the last four months of 1973. Since the strike by commercial bank employees had taken place in the corresponding four months of 1972, it is not possible to analyse meaningfully the monetary developments in this sub-period in relation to the developments in 1972.

1. Money Supply - Principal Trends

In the twelve months ending in August, 1973 the money supply increased by Rs. 327-7 million or 15-2 per cent compared to an increase of only Rs. 12-5 million or 0-6 per cent in the twelve months ending in August, 1972. The distortions resulting from the strike were no longer present by August, 1973 and the higher rate of monetary expansion that took place thereafter until the end of the year can only be ascribed to an increased demand for money.

During the period of the bank strike from end-August to mid-December, 1972 the disctuption of normal banking activities led to a very large increase in the money supply. The suspension of normal clearing arrangements resulted in a substantial increase in the money supply.

In the first two months of 1973, the money supply declined substantially by Rs. 239-0 million or by 9-6 per cent. Although the money supply falls during these two months in every year, the decline in 1973 was more pronounced as the money supply which had reached a very high level by the end of 1972 due to the strike was moving downwards with the resumption of normal banking operations. At the end of the first quarter of 1973, the money supply was Rs. 2410 million which is less than the level it had reached at the end of December 1972.

In the second quarter of 1973, the money supply increased rapidly to a seasonal peak of Rs. 2499 million in June. This is mainly attributable to the increase in credit given for the purchase of paddy under the Guaranteed Price Scheme. Although as in the previous years the money supply increased seasonally in June, July and August of 1973, the size of these increases was on the average, in excess of 15 per cent over the corresponding months of the previous year. The sharp increase in money supply in these months was due to the increase in net external banking assets as a result of a slight improvement in the overall balance of payments position.

ln the second sub-period, from end-August to end-December 1973, the money supply increased by Rs. 295 million or by 11.9 per cent which is a lower rate of expansion than in the twelve month period ending in August 1973. Unlike earlier in the year particularly in the months of January, February, and May 1973 when the money supply declined, in each of the months beginning in August and ending in December 1973 there were increases, in the money supply. In the last quarter of every year money supply tends to increase seasonally due to government financial operations. This seasonal factor was operative in 1973 and was strengthened by the increased, level of credit given for cultivation purposes in the lastrquarter of the year.

Factors affecting money supply

The factors underlying changes in the monev supply are given in table II (E) 2.

In the twelve months ending August 1973, the principal factor contributing to the increase in money supply was the increase of Rs. 270-3 million in the net external banking assets. In the twelve months ending in August 1972, the expans­ionary effect of net external banking assets was only Rs. 43-4 million.

The increase in the net external assets of the banking system comprised an increase in the net foreign assets of the Central Bank by Rs. 216-7 million and in the net foreign exchange holdings of the commercial banks by Rs. 53.6 million. The increase in Central Bank's net foreign assets was largly reflected in a reduction in borrowings abroad by Rs. 141-7. million and an increase in the Bank's holdings of cash and balances abroad of Rs. 48 • 3 million. The net foreign exchange holdings of the commercial banks, on the other hand, increased mainly with an increase of Rs. 71-6 million in their holdings of export bills and a reduction in their cash holdings with banks abroad of Rs. 20-3 million. The increase in interest rates abroad during this time discouraged some commercial banks from discounting export bills abroad and holding the proceeds in the form of cash balances abroad. The large holding of export bills by the commercial banks was also the result of an increase in the value of exports arising from improved prices for Sri Lanka's exports.

In the year ending in August, 1973 the operations of the private sector (in­clusive of government corporations and co-operative institutions) caused an ex­pansion in the money supply of Rs. 198.4 million while in the year ending August 1972, the expansion from this sector was Rs.143.4 million. Commercial bank credit to government corporations rose by Rs. 67-0 million while bank credit to "other private sector" customers and co-operative institutions increased by Rs. 102-2 million and Rs. 30-4 million respectively. Export bills are excluded from this because for the analysis of factors affecting the money supply, export bills are included under net external banking assets. Although the increase in credit granted to the private sector was lower by Rs. 54-2 million compared to the year ending in August 1972, the expansionary impact arising out of the operations of this sector was Rs. 55-0 million higher in the year to August, 1973- This was the result of a decline in time and savings deposits with the

commercial banks belonging to the private sector by Rs. 0-3 million compared to a substantial increase of Rs. 101*4 million in these deposits in the year to August, 1972. In fact, it can be seen that had the growth of these deposits in the year to August, 1973 proceeded at the same rate as in the previous year, the net expansion arising from this sector would have been less than what it was.

In the twelve months ending in August, 1973 government sector activities caused a contraction of Rs. 143*6 million on the money supply. In the year to August, 1972 the contraction was lower at Rs. 88-9 million. The government's debt to the banking system declined by Rs. 94*8 million in the year ending August, 1973. The Central Bank's holdings of government and govern­ment guaranteed securities fell by Rs. 22-4 million while its advances to the government increased by Rs. 83-0 million. The commercial banks' holdings of government paper declined by Rs. 155-4 million mainly due to a reduction in their holdings of Treasury bills by Rs. 135-3 million and government securities by Rs. 27-3 million. Commercial banks' claims on the government, however, increased by Rs. 9-8 million on account of their purchases of cash items on behalf of the government. An unusual feature of the impact of government financial operations on the money supply during this period was a substantial increase of Rs. 90 • 8 million in government's deposits with the banking system and its cash balances. The government financed expenditure by recourse to advances from the Central Bank while accumulating its deposits and cash balances and retiring Treasury bills with the commercial banks and the Central Bank. Apart from the expansionary effect that arose from a reduction in the "other liabilities and accounts (net)" of the Central Bank, government financial operations brought about a substantial contractionary effect on the money supply. As the analysis presented here is not on a calender year basis, the normal seasonal expansion associated with government financial operations in the last quarter of each year is not included. On the other hand in the first eight months of each year theie is a seasonal contraction because government's revenue exceeds its expenditure.

In the period from end-August, 1973 to end-December, 1973, the money supply increased by Rs 294-9 million principally due to an expansion arising from operations in the government sector which amounted to Rs. 298-2 million, (excluding a change in "other liabilities and accounts (net)" of the Central Bank of Rs. 2-2 million). This expansion was largely the net result of an increase in the Central Bank's holding of government and government guaranteed securities of Rs. 231-8 million and an increase in the commercial bank holdings of these securities of Rs. 27-6 million, offset by an increase in government's deposits with the banking system and its cash balances by Rs. 105-4 million. Within this sector, an expansionary impact of Rs. 15-4 million also arose from commercial banks' purchases of cash items on account of the government. In contrast to the contraction resulting from government operations on the money supply witnessed in the year to August 1973, the remaining months of the year saw a substantial expansion resulting from the financial operations of this sector because in the last quarter of each year the increase in government expenditure in relation to revenue, results in a seasonal expansion of the money

( 116 )

supply. In contrast to the period analysed earlier, the government's borrowings from the banking system in the last four months of the year was in the form of security issues rather than advances from the Central Bank.

The external sector continued to exert an expansionary effect on the money supply in the last four months of 1973. The mt external banking assets increased by Rs. 117-0 million, increasing at a higher monthly rate of Rs. 29-2 million compared to a rate of increase of Rs. 22 • 5 million in the year ending in August 1973. Net foreign assets of the Central Bank increased by Rs. 56 • 3 million while net foreign exchange holdings of the commercial banks increased by Rs. 60-8 million. The increase in the net foreign assets of the Central Bank was largely reflected in an increase in its cash and balances held abroad by Rs. 136-0 million and a reduction in deposits held by international organizations of Rs. 18-8 million, partly offset by an increase in the Bank's borrowings abroad by Rs. 100-5 million. The Central Bank's borrowings abroad increased in the four months ending December 1973, compared to the twelve months ending August 1973, when these borrowings decreased substantially. But, in comparison with the previous period the rate of accumulation of cash and balances abroad as well as their magnitude was higher. The increase in the net foreign exchange holdings of the commercial banks consisted mainly of an increase in their cash and balances abroad by Rs. 47-0 million and in export bills by Rs. 18-2 million. In comparison to the previous period the last four months of 1973, saw a larger accumulation of cash and balances held by commercial banks abroad, and a smaller increase in export bills.

The operations of the private sector which produced a substantial expansion­ary impact on the money supply in the year ending August, 197 3 was considerably reduced in the last four months of 1973; it amounted only to Rs. 1-8 million. In this period commercial bank credit to " other private sector '' customers increased by Rs. 120-4 million, while credit to co-operative institutions and government corporations declined by Rs. 33 0 million and Rs. 13-6 million, respectively. Credit to co-operative institutions fell seasonally and was largely associated with the repayment of loans taken under the Guaranteed Price Scheme. The reduction in bank credit to government corporations in this period is ascribed to the high level of bank borrowings by these institutions in the year ending August, 1973 by which time their major credit requirements had been met. The net change in bank credit granted to the private sector (inclusive of co-operative institutions and government corporations) amounted to Rs. 73-8 million, which was partly offset by an increases in the time and savings deposits of the "other private sector1' customers by Rs. 56-5millon and of co-operative institutions by Rs. 2 4 million respectively. The volume of these deposits owned by government corporations declined marginally by Rs. 2 0 million and exerted an expansionary effect on money supply.

In contrast to the year ending August, 1973 when time and savings deposits declined, the increase in these deposits in the last four months of 1973, shows that these deposits have begun to increase at a rate comparable to that in the year ending August 1972.

Liquidity in the non-bank private sector

Table II (E) 3 presents the distribution of primary and secondary liquid assets of the non-bank private sector for the period 1970-1973.

In the year ending August, 1973 total liquid assets of the non-bank private sector increased by Rs. 609-4 million or 10-6 per cent compared to an increase of Rs. 362-7 million or 6-8 per cent in the year ending August 1972. The increase in the liquidity in this sector in the earlier year, arose from a larger increase in secondary liquid assets, while in the latter year it arose from a larger increase in primary liquid assets. In the year ending August, 1973 primary liquid assets increased by Rs. 327«7 million or 15-2 per cent while secondary liquid assets increased by Rs. 281-7 million or 7 - 9 per cent. The substantially higher rate of increase in money supply in the later year, was responsible for the large increase in the primary assets component of total liquid assets owned by this sector. The increase in primary liquid assets consisted of an increase in currency holdings by Rs. 163-6 million and in demand deposits by Rs. 164-1 million. In the year ending in August, 1973, in contrast to the trend in the last three years, demand deposits of this sector increased at a higher rate than its currency holdings. As a result, the currency ratio fell from 53-7 per cent to 53-2 per cent as shown in table 11(E) 4.

The increase in secondary liquid assets of the sector was mainly reflected in increases in time deposits and government bonds. The time deposits in the National Savings Bank increased by Rs. 38-6 million while those in the commercial banks declined by Rs. 61-0 million. The increase in time deposits with the National Sayings Bank arose out of higher interest rates on these deposits and the granting of an income tax exemption for interest earned

( 119 )

on both time and savings deposits with the bank, up to Rs. 1000 per. annum per individual, to a limit of six individuals per family. Savings certificates issued by the National Savings Bank increased,by Rs. 34-8 million in the year ending August 1973. A large part of this increase was associated with a tax exemption given on savings diposits and savings certificates upto 31st March, 1973. The holdings of government bonds by the non-bank private sector increased by Rs. 100-0 million, while the holdings of government paper by the commercial banks declined during this period.

In the last four months of 1973, the total liquid assets of the non-bank private sector increased by Rs. 434-8 million or 6-8 per cent. This increase comprised ah increase of Rs. 294 -9 million in primary liquid assets and an increase of Rs. 139-9 million in secondary liquid assets. As in the twelve months reviewed above, this period also saw a larger increase in primary liquid assets compared to secondary liquid assets.

The increase in the currency component of the money supply as shown on a calender year basis in table II ( E ) 5 was accompanied by an increase in the share of notes of larger denominations. Notes of the denominations of Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 which together formed 57-1 per cent of the currency issue at the end of December, 1971, increased to 60-9 per cent at the end of August, 1972 and increased further to 65-2 per cent at the end of December, 1973.

Table II (E) 6 shows the ownership of commercial bank deposits of the private sector. As a result of the strike since the private data for the third quarter of 1972 are not available and those for the last quarter of that year are distorted, :the analysis of changes in the ownership of deposits given here is on the basis of the second quarter of that year and 1973.

( 120 )

In the year ending June, 1973 total deposits belonging to the private sector with commercial banks increased by Rs. 91-3 million. Demand deposits increased by Rs. 128 • 1 million, while savings deposits increased by Rs. 38 • 6 million. On the other hand, time deposits with the commercial banks fell by Rs. 75-3 million.

The increase in demand deposits classified btoadly according to ownership between the business sector (comprising financial institutions, plantations, trading and manufacturing establishments and other business) and the non-business sector (comprising local authorities, non-business institutions and individuals) increased by Rs. 108 • 1 million and Rs. 20-0 million respectively. Within the business sector, the increase in demand deposits was distributed between manufacturing and other business firms. Demand deposits owned by financial institutions, plantations and trading establishments fell during this period. In the non­business sector all the ownership categories showed increases.

Time deposits held by the non-bank private sector decreased during the period mainly on account of the decreases in those deposits held by the business sector. In the non-bank private sector there were substantial declines in time deposits owned by trading establishments and "other" business which amounted to Rs. 34 • 1 million and Rs. 13 -5 million respectively. Time deposits held by the non-business sector also showed a net decline and this was mostly confined to non-business institutions and to individuals. The net decline in time deposits with the commercial banks was due to the movement of these deposits from the commercial banks to the National Savings Bank which offered higher interest rates and attractive tax concessions.

In the year ending June, 1973 the increase in savings deposits of the non-bank private sector was largely confined to deposits owned by individuals, which accounted for 74 • 3 per cent of the increase. Although the commercial banks continued to pay lower interest rates on savings deposits compared to the National Savings Bank there was no discernable shift in these deposits to the latter institution.

Interest rates

There were no changes in interest rates in the period under review. The last change in interest rates took place in May 1972 when the interest rate on savings certificates issued by the National Savings Bank was raised from 5 to 11 per cent.

2. Commercial Banking - Principal Trends

In the year ending August. 1973 the resources of the commercial banks increased substantially due to an increase in deposits of "other private sector" customers. In contrast to the first eight months of 1972 which was analysed in the previous report, in the period under review, there was a much larger expansion in the money supply, of which the demand deposit component increased by a larger proportion than currency. As a result the commercial banks had access to a larger amount of resources compared to the year ending August 1972. The increase

Ownership of Demand, Time & Savings Deposits of the Private Sector with Commercial Banks (as at end of period)

( 122 )

in deposits, was mostly confined to demand deposits, while time and savings deposits owned by the private sector declined slightly over the period. The ratio of liquid assets of commercial banks to their total deposits fell from 32 • 3 per cent at the end of August, 1972 to 30-7 per cent at the end of August, 1973. This was the result of a large increase in demand deposits and a much smaller increase in the liquid assets of commercial banks. Over the twelve months ending August, 1973, the ratios of cash to demand and to total deposits increased from 28-8 per cent to 32.2 per cent and from 13-5 per cent to 16-4 per cent, respec­tively. The large monetary expansion seen during these twelve months and the fact that credit to the private sector did not increase to offset the reduced level of borrowing by the government, in sum, led to the large increase in commercial bank investible funds.

The last four months of 1973 was also characterized by an increase in resources accruing to the commercial banks. Both government and private sector deposits with the commercial banks increased substantially. In contrast to the year ending in August, 1973 the last four months of 1973 saw a sharp increase in "other liabilities (net)" of the commercial banks.

Structure of bank assets and liabilities

Total assets/liabilities of commercial banks increased by Rs. 221-5 million during the year ending August, 1973 compared to an increase of Rs. 321 -9 million in the year ending in August 1972. On the liabilities side, this increase is mainly reflected in a rise in total deposits by Rs. 211-2 million. Within this category, demand deposits increased by Rs. 206-9 million, while time and savings deposits increased marginally by Rs. 4-3 million. During the year, domestic inter-bank borrowings declined by Rs. 7-1 million as commercial banks came to command a larger quantum of resources.

On the assets side, cash increased by Rs. 108-4 million, of which Rs. 66-5 million was due from the Central Bank. The latter increase was largely reflected in an increase in demand deposits on which higher reserve ratios than for savings deposits are applicable. Cash items in the process of collection increased by Rs. 18-9 million in the year ending in August, 1973. Bills purchased and discounted increased by Rs. 73-7 million. This increase was largely associated with export bills, the total value of which increased due to improved conditions in Sri Lanka's export trade. A reduction in investments by Rs. 162-4 million, was mainly due to a reduction in Treasury bills held by commercial banks. Loans and overdrafts increased by Rs. 117-0 million and Rs. 68-2 million, respectively and were smaller in magnitude compared to the year ending August, 1972.

During the last four months of 1973, total assets/liabilities of the commercial banks increased by Rs. 543.4 million, compared to the increase of Rs. 221.5 million in the year ending August, 1973. A substantial increase in demand deposits amounting to Rs. 351.4 million and an increase of Rs. 54.4 million in time and savings deposits combined with an increase in other liabilities by Rs. 135.1 million accounted for most of the increase in total liabilities.

On the assets side, the largest increase seen in the last four months of 1973 was in cash due from the Central Bank, which amounted to Rs. 260,5 millon. Loans and overdrafts increased by Rs. 84-0 million and Rs. 67-7 million, respectively.

Sources of funds and their utilization.

Changes in commercial bank resources and their utilization in the period 1970-1973 are shown in table II ( E ) 8.

During the period end-August, 1972 to end-August, 1973, there was a net inflow of resources to commercial banks from the government sector amoun­ting to Rs. 201.7 million. A reduction in government borrowings from the banking system of Rs. 163.1 million and an increase in government deposits with the commercial banks of Rs. 46.4 million, were the main factors that were responsible for this inflow. A reduction in commercial banks holdings of Treasury bills by Rs. 135-3 million accounted for a large part of the decline in the level of government borrowings.

There was a net inflow of funds into the commercial banks from the "other domestic private sector" of Rs. 47-4 million which was brought about by an increase in deposits owned by this sector of Rs. 149-6 million and an increase in borrowings by this sector of Rs. 102-2 million.

Government corporations borrowed Rs. 67-1 million from commercial banks while their deposits with the banks increased by Rs. 6-5 million, thus leading to a net outflow of resources from the commercial banks to those institutions. Co-operative institutions too, utilized a large amount of commer­cial bank funds in the form of advances amounting Rs. 30-5 million, while the increase in their deposits with the banks was only Rs. 6-5 million.

The commercial banks increased their borrowings from the Central Bank by Rs. 36-8 million and their reserves with the Central Bank increased by Rs. 66 • 5 million due to the increase in demand deposits.

Capital and reserves of commercial banks which constitute a source of funds, increased by Rs. 20-6 million. An increase in till cash by Rs. 4 1 0 million and an increase in inter-bank ( net) transactions by Rs. 45-4 million accounted almost fully for the utilization of inter-bank funds. Commercial banks foreign balances increased by Rs. 52-3 million while their foreign borrowings as a source of funds was insignificant.

In the last four months of 1973 too, there was a net inflow of funds into the commercial banks from the government sector. Although the government borrowed up to Rs. 27 • 6 million from the commercial banks, its deposits with the commercial banks increased by Rs. 161-2 million. The operations of the "other domestic sector'' also led to a net accrual of resources to the banks, as a result of a larger increase in deposits belonging to them compared to the increase in their borrowings from the commercial banks. Commercial banks' net claims on the Central Bank increased by Rs. 248-1 million as a result of a substantial increase in their reserves with the Central Bank, comprising deposits of Rs 260-5 million less borrowings from the Central Bank of Rs. 12-4 million.

Commercial bank credit to the private sector

Commercial bank credit to the private sector increased by Rs 269.0 million or 13-5 per cent in the year ending August, 1973, compared to an increase of Rs. 233-6 million or 13 - 2 per cent in the year ending August, 1972. In the year under review, loans increased by Rs. 117-0 million and overdrafts by Rs. 67-1 million. The "other private sector" customers and government corporations received a substantial proportion of loans and overdrafts compared to the co-operative institutions which accounted for only Rs. 9-8 million of the increase in these two categories of credit. Cultivation loans which figure prominently in the borrowings by co-operative institutions are mostly taken in the last quarter of each year, and therefore the small increase in the borrow­ings by these institutions was due to the absence of this seasonal demand for credit in the period being reviewed.

Export bills discounted by the commercial banks increased substantially by Rs. 71-6 million in the year to August, 1973, compared to a decline of Rs. 21-5 million in the year to August, 1972. As was pointed out earlier, higher interest rates abroad and improved trade conditions, accounted for large holdings of export bills by commercial banks in this period. Hold­ings of import bills by commercial banks, on the other hand, increased by a relatively small amount of Rs. 5-0 million. Commercial banks which held import bills to the value of Rs. 161-4 million at the end of December, 1972, had reduced these holdings by Rs. 104 • 7 million by the end of February, 1973 and by August held only Rs. 37.0 million. This rapid decline in the holdings of import bills was due to the resumption of normal banking business; banks had come to hold a large amount of import bills during the strike period. By August, 1973 the holdings of these bills had returned to normal levels.

Cash items in the process of collection, increased by Rs. 9-1 million in the year ending in August 1973. Although changes associated with the establishment of the Paddy Marketing Board in January, 1972, had increased the magnitude of this item in commercial bank credit to the private sector through the shifting of the part of the burden of financing paddy stocks from the government budget to bank credit, the increase was a modest one. This arises from the fact that finance for the purchases of paddy under the Guaranteed Price Scheme reach a peak in May and June of each year, and by August the contribution of this item to the increase in total credit falls. Similarly in the last quarter of each year the same seasonal factor leads to a decline in the absolute magnitude of cash items in the process of collection.

In the last four months of 1973, bank credit to the private sector increased by Rs. 95 • 8 million and showed a higher monthly average rate of increase compared to the twelve months reviewed in the earlier section. The increase in loans was Rs. 84-0 million and overdrafts Rs. 68-2 million but despite this the monthly rate of increase in overdrafts was higher than that for loans. The value of export bills discounted increased by Rs. 18-2 million and that of import bills by Rs. 13-4 million. The most significant change in the level of commercial bank credit to the private sector in the last four months of 1973 was

the substantial decline in the cash items in the process of collection by Rs. 87 • 7 million. As commented upon earlier, it resulted from a decrease in advances for paddy purchases under the Guaranteed Price Scheme, which is a seasonal feature characteristic of this time of the year.

Table II (E) 10 gives a classification of commercial bank advances by purpose and maturity. The data included in these tables are collected by quarterly returns received from the commercial banks. Due to the strike by commercial bank employees in September, 1972, banks were not able to furnish the data for the quarter ending in September of that year. An analysis based on the comparison of the first two quarters of 1972 and 1973, was therefore considered appropriate.

Commercial bank advances to the private sector ( the total of commercial bank credit to the private sector less cash items in the process of collection ) increased by Rs. 231 • 2 million in the year ending June, 1973. Advances for commercial purposes increased by Rs. 158-1 million, thus raising their share in total advances from 40 • 5 to 43-7 per cent. Although the advances for industrial purposes increased by Rs. 54 • 7 million, their share in total advances declined from 27-3 per cent to 26-9 per cent. The share of advances for consump­tion purposes increased by 0-1 per cent owing to the increase in the level of these advances by Rs. 21-1 million. Advances for financial purposes fell by Rs. 4-2 million and their share in total advances also fell by 1-0 percent. Advances for agricultural purposes increased by 1-9 million but their share in total advances fell by 1-4 per cent. The category of advances classified as 'other' advances fell during the year under review, both in absolute amount and as a share of total advances.

The maturity pattern of advances to the private sector changed in the year ending June, 1973 as a result of an increase in the share of short-term advances in total advances by 2 • 7 per cent being accompanied by declines in the shares of medium and long-term advances by 1 - 3 per cent and 1 -4 per cent, respectively. The resultant shortening in the maturity of commercial bank advances was associated with the large increase in advances for commercial purposes compared to advances for all other purposes.

A detailed breakdown of commercial bank advances for industrial purposes is given in table II (E) 11. The increase in advances for this purpose amounted to Rs. 54-7 million in the year to June, 1973. This increase was shared almost equally between government corporations and private sector industrialists. Although the largest share of the increase went to ' other' industries, this must be interpreted with caution as it is a residual category. Textile, engineering and construction industries claimed a significant amount of the increase in advances for industrial purposes. Advances to the chemical products industry showed the largest decline during this period.

Advances classified by rate of interest are shown in table II ( E ) 12. The largest concentration was at 8 J per cent in the year ending in June 1973, as was also the case in the year ending in June 1972. The share of advances granted

Note: The reduction in the number of British banks in 1969, 1970 and 1973 was on account of:-

1. The conversion of the Eastern Bank Ltd. into a Ceylonese bank in 1969. 2. Reconstruction of the Hatton Bank and two branches of the National and Grindlays Bank to form the Hatton National Bank in 1970. 3. The Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd., acquired three branches of the Mercantile Bank Ltd. in 1973. * Exclude Kachcheri branches opened in 1971 and 1972. ** The figures for deposits are as at the end of August.

People's Bank opened 11 branches in Bandaragama, Wilgamuwa, Eravur, Nikaweratiya, Kalpitiya, Grandpass, Nildandahinna, Rattota, Rakwana, Hakmana and Udugama. The Hatton National Bank opened four offices in Bandarawela, Wellawatta, Ratnapura and Negombo. The Commercial Bank of Ceylon opened one office in Matara and took over 3 branches of Mercantile Bank - in Jaffna, Kandy and Galle. As a result, the total number of branch offices belonging to the Marcantile Bank declined to 2 offices as at end of the year.

( 134 )

The National Savings Bank opened 3 branches - in Matara, Anuradhapura

and Jaffna in 1973. Its number of branches amounted to 6 at the end of the

year.

The share of Ceylonese banks in total deposits rose from 79 per cent at the end of August, 1972 to 82 per cent at the end of December, 1973 while the shares of British, and Indian and Pakistani banks declined from 17 per cent to

15 per cent and from 4 per cent to 3 per cent respectively. The share of demand deposits held with Sri-Lanka's banks increased from 78 • 7 per cent to 81 • 5 per cent and the share of time and savings deposits held by them increased from 79-6 per cent to 81 -5 per cent, over the period end-August 1972 to end-December 1973.

The average size of demand deposits owned by the private sector with all banks rose from Rs. 5,027 at the end of June 1972 to Rs. 5,814 at the end of June 1973. Meanwhile the average size of time deposits increased from

Rs. 36,918 to Rs. 44,233. On the other hand, the average size of savings deposits declined, from Rs. 1,060 to Rs. 935.

3. Savings and Long-term Credit Institutions'

Statistics of lending operations of State-sponsored savings and lending institutions are shown in table 11(E) 15- The total volume of loans granted by these institutions increased by Rs. 12 • 9 million in 1973, compared to a decline

of Rs. 7*4 million in 1972. Loans granted by the Development Finance Corporation increased by Rs. 10-8 million and accounted for the largest share of the increase. Loans granted by the State Mortage Bank, the National Savings Bank and the Loan Board increased marginally while those granted by the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation and the National Housing Department declined.

** As at end August.

As described earlier, the most significant feature of the movements in savings deposits and savings certificates in 1973 has been the increase in savings deposits and savings certificates issued by the National Savings Bank. This increase was due to the higher interest rates paid and the income tax con­cessions granted to its deposit and savings certificate holders. The interest received by individuals on savings certificates issued and purchased on or before 31st March, 1973 was exempt from income tax without any upper limit. Interest upto a total of Rs. 1000 per individual in respect of time and savings deposits and savings certificates issued on or after 1st April, 1973 was also exempted from income tax. In the case of a family, this exemption was limited to six individuals. These concessions, however, were available only to individuals and excluded companies, bodies of persons, etc.

The marginal increase in commercial banks' savings and time deposits by

Rs. 4-3 million in 1973 compared to an increase of Rs. 35-8 million between

1971 and 1972 arose from the more attractive terms offered to savers by the National Savings Bank.

The total contributions received by the Employees Provident Fund amounted to Rs. 188-3 million as compared to Rs. 176-6 million in 1972.

5. Central Banking

The Central Bank's assets/liabilities increased by Rs. 490-5 million in the year ending in August 1973. Of this increase, other assets and accounts amounted to Rs. 421-4 million. Loans given to commercial banks declined by Rs. 38-6 million. Although Central Bank's holdings of government and government guaranteed securities decreased by Rs. 22-4 million during this year, its provisional advances to the government increased by Rs. 83-0 million. Cash and balances held by the Central Bank abroad increased by Rs. 48-3 million.

( 138 )

On the liabilities side, the largest increase was seen in other liabilities which amounted to Rs. 375 »4 million. The currency issue which increased by Rs. 199-3 million also contributed to the increase in total liabilities. Deposits of the commercial banks and of the governinent held with the Central Bank, increased by Rs. 31-6 million and Rs. 49-4 million, respectively. A substantial decrease in the Bank's borrowings abroad of Rs. 141-7 million helped to contain the overall increase in liabilities.

ln the last four months of 1973 Central Bank's assets/liabilities rose by Rs. 437-1 million. The increase in assets took place largely on account of an increased level of lending to the government. Its holdings of government paper increased by Rs. 231.8 million while its provisional advances to the government increased by Rs. 23-4 million. On the liabilities side, an increase in commercial banks' deposits with the Central Bank of Rs. 269-8 million accounted for most of the increase in total liabilities. Overall liabilities of the Central Bank increased by Rs 200-8 million, while its liabilities in the form of notes and coins in circulation increased by Rs. 106-5 million. Compared to the increase in government's deposits seen in the twelve months ending August, 1973 these deposits declined by Rs. 55 • 5 million in the last four months of 1973.

Refinance loans granted by the Central Bank from the Medium and Long term Credit Fund amounted to Rs. 12.1 million in 1973. Of this amount Rs. 11.3 million was granted under the tea factory modernization project. Refinance loans granted for industrial and agricultural purposes amounted to Rs. 62,500. A refinance loan of Rs. 0.8 million was also given to the tourist industry. As in the previous year, loans for agricultural and industrial purposes were obtained by the State Mortgage Bank and the Development Finance Corporation while the commercial banks did not make use of this facility for agricultural and industrial purposes. However, the commercial banks accounted for Rs. 11.1 million of the loans granted for the tea factory modernization project. During the year, Rs. 16.0 million was credited to the Fund from repayments of loans. The balance in the Fund as at the end of December 1973 was Rs. 21.4 million. The amount out­standing at the end of December 1972 on total refinance loans granted from the Fund since its inception was Rs. 53-7 million.

Monetary policy remained unchanged since 1, April, 1972 when a selective policy measure was introduced. With effect from that date, commercial banks were asked to refrain from increasing credit for non-essential purposes such as consumption, speculative stock building etc., over the level of such credit as on 31, March, 1972. A bank rate of 6fc percent and the minimum reserve require­ment ratios already in force against demand, savings and time deposits with commercial banks continued to serve as the instruments of general credit policy during the period up to December, 1973.

The Central Bank continued to watch monetary and credit developments closely but felt that no changes in policy measures were necessary in view of the particular manner in which the monetary expansion took place during this period. The expansion in money supply arose largely out of increases in (net) external banking assets which were reversible both on account of the outstan-

( 139 )

ding foreign short term obligations and the expected increases in the payments for imports. As the increase in credit to the private sector was largely for productive purposes and was not appreciably large in magnitude additional restrictions were not required. The ceiling on non-essential credit to this sector was sufficient to prevent commercial bank credit from expanding into undesirable channels.
