The second sub-period covers the last four months of 1973.

Unlike earlier in the year particularly in the months of January, February, and May 1973 when the money supply declined, in each of the months beginning in August and ending in December 1973 there were increases, in the money supply. In the last quarter of every year money supply tends to increase seasonally due to government financial operations. This seasonal factor was operative in 1973 and was strengthened by the increased, level of credit given for cultivation purposes in the lastrquarter of the year.",

The net foreign exchange holdings of the commercial banks, on the other hand, increased mainly with an increase of Rs. 71-6 million in their holdings of export bills and a reduction in their cash holdings with banks abroad of Rs. 20-3 million. The increase in interest rates abroad during this time discouraged some commercial banks from discounting export bills abroad and holding the proceeds in the form of cash balances abroad. The large holding of export bills by the commercial banks was also the result of an increase in the value of exports arising from improved prices for Sri Lanka's exports.",

In the year to August, 1972 the contraction was lower at Rs. 88-9 million. The government's debt to the banking system declined by Rs. 94*8 million in the year ending August, 1973. The Central Bank's holdings of government and govern\u00adment guaranteed securities fell by Rs. 22-4 million while its advances to the government increased by Rs. 83-0 million. The commercial banks' holdings of government paper declined by Rs. 155-4 million mainly due to a reduction in their holdings of Treasury bills by Rs. 135-3 million and government securities by Rs. 27-3 million. Commercial banks' claims on the government, however, increased by Rs. 9-8 million on account of their purchases of cash items on behalf of the government. An unusual feature of the impact of government financial operations on the money supply during this period was a substantial increase of Rs. 90 \u2022 8 million in government's deposits with the banking system and its cash balances. The government financed expenditure by recourse to advances from the Central Bank while accumulating its deposits and cash balances and retiring Treasury bills with the commercial banks and the Central Bank. Apart from the expansionary effect that arose from a reduction in the \"other liabilities and accounts (net)\" of the Central Bank, government financial operations brought about a substantial contractionary effect on the money supply. As the analysis presented here is not on a calender year basis, the normal seasonal expansion associated with government financial operations in the last quarter of each year is not included. On the other hand in the first eight months of each year theie is a seasonal contraction because government's revenue exceeds its expenditure.",

This expansion was largely the net result of an increase in the Central Bank's holding of government and government guaranteed securities of Rs. 231-8 million and an increase in the commercial bank holdings of these securities of Rs. 27-6 million, offset by an increase in government's deposits with the banking system and its cash balances by Rs. 105-4 million. Within this sector, an expansionary impact of Rs. 15-4 million also arose from commercial banks' purchases of cash items on account of the government. In contrast to the contraction resulting from government operations on the money supply witnessed in the year to August 1973, the remaining months of the year saw a substantial expansion resulting from the financial operations of this sector because in the last quarter of each year the increase in government expenditure in relation to revenue, results in a seasonal expansion of the money",

Net foreign assets of the Central Bank increased by Rs. 56 \u2022 3 million while net foreign exchange holdings of the commercial banks increased by Rs. 60-8 million. The increase in the net foreign assets of the Central Bank was largely reflected in an increase in its cash and balances held abroad by Rs. 136-0 million and a reduction in deposits held by international organizations of Rs. 18-8 million, partly offset by an increase in the Bank's borrowings abroad by Rs. 100-5 million. The Central Bank's borrowings abroad increased in the four months ending December 1973, compared to the twelve months ending August 1973, when these borrowings decreased substantially. But, in comparison with the previous period the rate of accumulation of cash and balances abroad as well as their magnitude was higher. The increase in the net foreign exchange holdings of the commercial banks consisted mainly of an increase in their cash and balances abroad by Rs. 47-0 million and in export bills by Rs. 18-2 million. In comparison to the previous period the last four months of 1973, saw a larger accumulation of cash and balances held by commercial banks abroad, and a smaller increase in export bills.",

    "text": "The operations of the private sector which produced a substantial expansion\u00adary impact on the money supply in the year ending August, 197 3 was considerably reduced in the last four months of 1973; it amounted only to Rs. 1-8 million. In this period commercial bank credit to \" other private sector '' customers increased by Rs. 120-4 million, while credit to co-operative institutions and government corporations declined by Rs. 33 0 million and Rs. 13-6 million, respectively. Credit to co-operative institutions fell seasonally and was largely associated with the repayment of loans taken under the Guaranteed Price Scheme. The reduction in bank credit to government corporations in this period is ascribed to the high level of bank borrowings by these institutions in the year ending August, 1973 by which time their major credit requirements had been met. The net change in bank credit granted to the private sector (inclusive of co-operative institutions and government corporations) amounted to Rs. 73-8 million, which was partly offset by an increases in the time and savings deposits of the \"other private sector1' customers by Rs. 56-5millon and of co-operative institutions by Rs. 2 4 million respectively. The volume of these deposits owned by government corporations declined marginally by Rs. 2 0 million and exerted an expansionary effect on money supply.",

The increase in the liquidity in this sector in the earlier year, arose from a larger increase in secondary liquid assets, while in the latter year it arose from a larger increase in primary liquid assets. In the year ending August, 1973 primary liquid assets increased by Rs. 327\u00ab7 million or 15-2 per cent while secondary liquid assets increased by Rs. 281-7 million or 7 - 9 per cent. The substantially higher rate of increase in money supply in the later year, was responsible for the large increase in the primary assets component of total liquid assets owned by this sector. The increase in primary liquid assets consisted of an increase in currency holdings by Rs. 163-6 million and in demand deposits by Rs. 164-1 million. In the year ending in August, 1973, in contrast to the trend in the last three years, demand deposits of this sector increased at a higher rate than its currency holdings. As a result, the currency ratio fell from 53-7 per cent to 53-2 per cent as shown in table 11(E) 4.",

Time deposits held by the non-business sector also showed a net decline and this was mostly confined to non-business institutions and to individuals. The net decline in time deposits with the commercial banks was due to the movement of these deposits from the commercial banks to the National Savings Bank which offered higher interest rates and attractive tax concessions.",

This was the result of a large increase in demand deposits and a much smaller increase in the liquid assets of commercial banks. Over the twelve months ending August, 1973, the ratios of cash to demand and to total deposits increased from 28-8 per cent to 32.2 per cent and from 13-5 per cent to 16-4 per cent, respec\u00adtively. The large monetary expansion seen during these twelve months and the fact that credit to the private sector did not increase to offset the reduced level of borrowing by the government, in sum, led to the large increase in commercial bank investible funds.",

This increase was largely associated with export bills, the total value of which increased due to improved conditions in Sri Lanka's export trade.

In the year under review, loans increased by Rs. 117-0 million and overdrafts by Rs. 67-1 million. The \"other private sector\" customers and government corporations received a substantial proportion of loans and overdrafts compared to the co-operative institutions which accounted for only Rs. 9-8 million of the increase in these two categories of credit. Cultivation loans which figure prominently in the borrowings by co-operative institutions are mostly taken in the last quarter of each year, and therefore the small increase in the borrow\u00adings by these institutions was due to the absence of this seasonal demand for credit in the period being reviewed.",

As was pointed out earlier, higher interest rates abroad and improved trade conditions, accounted for large holdings of export bills by commercial banks in this period. Hold\u00adings of import bills by commercial banks, on the other hand, increased by a relatively small amount of Rs. 5-0 million. Commercial banks which held import bills to the value of Rs. 161-4 million at the end of December, 1972, had reduced these holdings by Rs. 104 \u2022 7 million by the end of February, 1973 and by August held only Rs. 37.0 million. This rapid decline in the holdings of import bills was due to the resumption of normal banking business; banks had come to hold a large amount of import bills during the strike period. By August, 1973 the holdings of these bills had returned to normal levels.",

Although changes associated with the establishment of the Paddy Marketing Board in January, 1972, had increased the magnitude of this item in commercial bank credit to the private sector through the shifting of the part of the burden of financing paddy stocks from the government budget to bank credit, the increase was a modest one. This arises from the fact that finance for the purchases of paddy under the Guaranteed Price Scheme reach a peak in May and June of each year, and by August the contribution of this item to the increase in total credit falls. Similarly in the last quarter of each year the same seasonal factor leads to a decline in the absolute magnitude of cash items in the process of collection.",

The share of advances for consump\u00adtion purposes increased by 0-1 per cent owing to the increase in the level of these advances by Rs. 21-1 million. Advances for financial purposes fell by Rs. 4-2 million and their share in total advances also fell by 1-0 percent. Advances for agricultural purposes increased by 1-9 million but their share in total advances fell by 1-4 per cent. The category of advances classified as 'other' advances fell during the year under review, both in absolute amount and as a share of total advances.",

Although the largest share of the increase went to ' other' industries, this must be interpreted with caution as it is a residual category.

    "text": "As described earlier, the most significant feature of the movements in savings deposits and savings certificates in 1973 has been the increase in savings deposits and savings certificates issued by the National Savings Bank. This increase was due to the higher interest rates paid and the income tax con\u00adcessions granted to its deposit and savings certificate holders. The interest received by individuals on savings certificates issued and purchased on or before 31st March, 1973 was exempt from income tax without any upper limit. Interest upto a total of Rs. 1000 per individual in respect of time and savings deposits and savings certificates issued on or after 1st April, 1973 was also exempted from income tax. In the case of a family, this exemption was limited to six individuals. These concessions, however, were available only to individuals and excluded companies, bodies of persons, etc.",
