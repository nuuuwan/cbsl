This was the first time since 1954/55 that the fiscal operations of the government have resulted in a contractionary effect. In the Approved Estimates for the financial year 1973 it was expected that government's fiscal operations would necessitate recourse to bank borrowings to the extent of Rs. 100 million In the event, a substantial increase in revenue together with a record non-bank borrowing has enabled the government to reduce its indebtedness to the banking system by Rs. 116 million. During the year, while borrowings from the Central bank increased by Rs. 114 million, the government reduced its indebted\u00adness to the commercial banks by Rs. 230 million. On the other hand, cash balances (including foreign aid counterpart funds) were drawn down by Rs. 63 million. Consequently, the net contractionary impact of the budgetary opera\u00adtions in 1973 amounted to Rs. 53 million in contrast to the net expansionary impact of Rs. 139 million in 1971/72 (15 months).",

Further, determined attempts were made by the Inland Revenue Department to collect arrears of taxes. The general improvement in the prices of our major exports, particularly rubber, contributed to the substantial increase in export duty receipts. The increase in collections of business turnover tax was brought about to a large extent b y the general increase in prices of commodities which enhanced their value of their turnover in money terms, as well as b y the increases in the tax rates on a number of non-essential and luxury goods effected during the year. The increase in the receipts from the sale of FEECs was the direct result of the increase in the FEECs rate from 55 per cent to 65 per cent and the extension of the coverage of the FEECs scheme to certain imports hitherto exempt from FEECs in November, 1972. The increase in the rate of tobacco tax by Rs. 5 per pound largely accounts for the increas\u00aded receipts from this source.",

The latter increase in capital expenditure is in contrast to the tendency in recent years for the actual capital expenditure to fall short of the original provisions. However, in real terms the increase in capital expenditure may only be marginal. It also shows that the supplementary estimates in respect of capital expenditure have been substantial during the course of the year. In 1973 supplementary provisions chargeable to capital votes amounting to Rs. 113 million1 were passed by the National State Assembly. The major supplementary estimates were on account of grants to various corporations (Rs. 68 million), district food production drive (Rs. 15 million) and amortization pay\u00adments (Rs. 15 million). When the total provisions in respect of expenditure chargeable to capital votes (i. e. Approved Estimates plus the supplementary estimates) are compared with the actual expenditure incurred, the extent of under-expenditure would amount to Rs. 261 million or 19 per cent, which more or less corresponds to the originally anticipated under-expenditure of 20 per cent. In contrast, the under-expenditure in respect of capital votes was very much higher (Rs. 350 million or 29 per cent) in 1971/72 (pro-rata).",

In comparison, the budgetary operations in 1970/71 and 1971/72.resulted in a net expansionary impact ;of Rs. 218 million and Rs. I l l million (pro-rata) respectively. In 1973, the net receipts of foreign finance declined by Rs. 124 million over the assistance received in (pro-rata) 1971/72. Resources mobilized from the domestic non-bank market sources increased substantially by Rs. 181 million. Administrative borrowings, too, increased considerably by Rs. 52 million to Rs. 251 million. On the other hand, there was a net repayment of Rs. 116 million made to the banking system in 1973 whereas, in 1971/72, borrowings from the banking system amounted to Rs. 226 million. Meanwhile, cash balance (including foreign and counterpart funds) were drawn down to the extent of Rs. 63 million whereas, in 1971/72, government's cash balances increased by Rs. 115 million (pro-rata).",

This comprised Rs. 94 million of Treasury bills and Rs. 34 million of Advances, partly offset by a repayment of Rs. 14 million of rupee securities. Meanwhile, by retiring Treasury bills amounting to Rs. 206 million and by repaying Rs. 24 million of rupee securities, the government reduced its indebtedness to the commercial banks by Rs. 230 million. The net effect of these operations was a decline of Rs. 116 million in the liability of the govern\u00adment to the banking system, whereas, in the previous financial year (pro-rata) government's indebtedness to the banking sector increased by Rs. 226 million.",

    "text": "Gross foreign finance utilized to meet the budget deficit in 1973 amounted to Rs. 393 million. Of this amount, project loans amounted to Rs. 153 million (or 38-8 per cent) and non-project (commodity) aid Rs. 194 million (or 49-3 per cent) while grants constituted Rs. 47 million (or 11-9 per cent). When allowance is made for amortization payments, the net foreign finance available was Rs. 160 million, which comprised Rs. 55 million of project loans, Rs. 59 million of non-project (commodity) loans and Rs. 47 million in grants. In comparison, the net foreign finance utilized in the previous financial year (pro-rata) amounted to Rs. 284 million consisting Rs. 227 million by non-project (com\u00admodity) loans and Rs. 60 million of grants, while there has been a net repayment of Rs. 3 million on account of project loans. Though there has been an increase of Rs. 58 million in the net receipts of project loans over that of the previous financial year, net commodity aid receipts fell sharply by Rs. 168 million. In the year under review, project loans, non-project (commodity) aid and grants helped to finance 5-6 per cent, 6-0 per cent and 4-8 per cent, respectively of the net cash deficit.",

    "text": "As mentioned earlier, the budgetary operations in 1973 resulted in a net contractionary effect of Rs. 53 million. It is evident from table II ( G ) 1 that government budgets in recent years have consistently had an expansionary impact on the economy. The expansionary impact of annual budgets reached a peak in 1969/70 of Rs. 425 million; since then, however, they have declined continuously largely helped by substantial borrowings from non-bank sources. In 1973, the government has in fact managed to reduce its indebtedness to the banking system as a whole by Rs. 116 million. While borrowings from the Central Bank increased by Rs. 114 million, the government reduced its indebtedness to the commercial banks by Rs. 230 million. The reduction in government's indebted\u00adness to the banking system was aided to a large extent by the record gross domestic non-bank market borrowing of Rs. 819 million effected during the year. The circumstances underlying this successful resource mobilization effort have been analysed in the later section on \"Public Debt\". It must, however, be noted that at a time when receipts of foreign finance as a source of budgetary support have continued to decline, domestic non-bank borrowings have more than made up this shortfall and helped to sustain the investment programmes of the government.",

    "text": "In recent years, particularly in the last two financial years, domestic non-market borrowings (i. e. administrative borrowings) have also substantially financed budget deficits. These borrowings amounted to Rs. 199 million in 1971/72 (pro-rata) and to Rs. 251 million in the year under review. Domestic non-market borrowings and repayments relate to certain transactions of the govern\u00adment which take place administratively, i. e. such borrowings and repayments are outside the market for both bank and non-bank borrowings. Domestic non-market borrowings are mostly credited to separate accounts in the Treasury books unlike domestic market borrowings, which are credited to the Consolidated Fund.1 The domestic non - market borrowings and repayments which are commonly referred to as \"administrative borrowings*' (although administrative borrowings are strictly just one form of domestic non-market borrowings) comprise net transactions on \"Deposits\" such as suitors' and contractors' deposits, miscellaneous funds, the widows' and orphans' fund, public service provident fund etc , and sundry loans to institutions such as the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation and Local Loans and Development Fund. The surplus balances of certain government funds and agencies are also temporarily horrowed by the Treasury and go to form part of domestic non-market borrowings. \u201e Examples of such deposits ate those of public corporations, Tea Subsidy Fund and the Rubber Replanting Subsidy Fund.",

    "text": "For the first time in recent years, the government made a determined attempt to tackle one of the basic sources of the budgetary imbalance, namely the food subsidy. The measures announced by the government in October, 1973 in respect of the rationing of rice, flour and sugar were expected to result in subs\u00adtantial savings on account of the net food snbsidy in 1974. The escalation of food prices in world markets, however, is expected to wipe off the gains anticipa\u00adted during 1974- These developments have clearly exposed the vulnerability of the budget to circumstances beyond the country's control. Although the govern\u00adment has sought to contain the food subsidy at manageable proportions, its success would clearly depend on its ability to adopt a flexible pricing policy in relation to subsidized food items.",

In recent years, additional resources mobilized from domestic non-bank sources have become substantial while foreign resources which contributed nearly 45 per cent of the budget dificit in 1968/69 have since then come to contribute a gradually declining proportion of the deficit. Considerations of internal financial stabiliity would necessarily have to limit the government's recourse to borrowings from the banking system. The required increases in government capital expenditure, in keeping with the targets of the Five Year Plan, will mean that the government might have to contend with progressively increasing budget deficitsin the future.",

The interest payments on both domestic debt and foreign debt in 1973 amounted to Rs. 519 million while in 1974 it is expected to amount to Rs. 602 million or 15 per cent of the total recurrent expenditure. In absolute terms the interest cost on public debt in 1974 will be of a slightly higher magnitude than that of the gross food subsidy estimated for 1974.

In October, 1973 the government was compelled to introduce a number of measures3 in the light of sharply increasing food prices and transport costs the world over. With these measures, the government was able, to some extent, to contain the gross food subsidy within the originally estimated cost for 1973. As these measures were taken towards the end of the year, the full impact of these measures would be felt only during 1974. The increase in the gross food subsidy during 1973 was the result of increased subsidies of Rs. 75 million or 14 per cent on rice, Rs. 39 million on flour and Rs. 12 million on dhall, partly offset by the complete elimination of the subsidy on locally produced chillies.",

The measures adopted in respect of rice at the same time, were to lead to a reduction in the purchase by the Food Commissioner of both imported and local rice. These purchases were expected to decrease from 346,000 tons to 105,000 tons in respect of imported rice and from 337,000 tons to 211,000 tons in respect of local rice. The cost of imported rice was expected to rise from Rs. 1,005/- to Rs. 1,823/-per long ton. The raising of the guaranteed price for paddy to Rs. 25/- per bushel involves an increase in the purchase price of local rice from Rs. 1,524/- to Rs. 1,970/- per long ton. Consequently, the subsidy on rice is expected to be reduced by only Rs. 25 million.",

On a pro-rata basis for 12 months the increase would be Rs. 474 million. About Rs. 200 million or half of the increase in foreign debt during 1973 arose from an increase in liability on account of the re-alignment of world currencies. When allowance is made for this factor, the real increase in foreign debt of Rs. 203 million in 1973 was appreciably lower than comparable increase of Rs. 294 million in 1971/72 ( pro-rata) .",

This trend reflects the major role played by external assistance in financing the budgets of recent years. Though there was a decrease in foreign debt incurred in the year 1973, the foreign debt component of the gross public debt rose marginally to 25 per cent. While the absolute increase in the domestic debt has been substantial in recent years, proportionately the increase in foreign debt has outstripped the increase in domestic debt. The domestic debt component of gross debt was 75 per cent at the end of 1973.",

Since 1970/71, all rupee securities issued have been of a 10 to 12 year duration. Consequently, an increasing proportion of these loans which originally belonged to the 10 to 15 year maturity group now come under the 5-10 year group. On the other hand, the share of securities maturing in 20 to 25 years, which at the end of the financial year 1968/69 were Rs. 1,596 million ( or 29 per cent of the total debt), has declined sharply to Rs. 375 million ( or 4 per cent of the total) at the end of 1973, owing to the non-issue of long-term rupee loans for the past few years.

As observed in the last Annual Report, the increased investments in rupee securities by the Fund since 1970/71 have been primarily due to the increase, with effect from January, 1971 in the rates of contributions by employers and employees and the extension of the Fund's coverage. In 1973, the contributions to the fund increased by about Rs. 40 million over the 1971/72 pro-rata figure of Rs. 158 million, while the increase observed in 1971/72 (pro\u00adrata ) over that of 1970/71 was in the region of Rs. 15 million. There was, however, an additional factor which helped to enhance the contributions from the Fund in 1973. In 1971/72, the Fund's investments had averaged about Rs. 14 million per month up to August 1972, while during the last four months of 1972 such investments totalled Rs. 43 million averaging only Rs. 10 million per month. This fall in the average rate of investment was largely the result of the delayed clearing of cheques on account of the commercial bank strike in late",

Government was able to retire a fair proportion of these Treasury bills on the resumption of work in banks in the early part of 1973. However, the fact that the government was able to retire Rs. 112 million worth of Treasury bills held by the banking system in 1973, is indicative of the increasing financial restraint which the budgets in recent years have sought to achieve.",

In the year under review, the actual receipts of foreign finance fell far short of the budgetary expectations (by Rs. 148 million) and this was entirely due to a decrease in the utilization of non-project (commodity) aid. Any shortfall in project aid, as has been the case in the past, while directly reducing the capital investment during the year would also indiiectly cause a further reduction in the local expenditure of a capital nature associated with the project. Shortfalls in commodity aid, too, have an adverse impact on the supply of goods required for investment and though these are often only delayed, the timely receipt of such aid may be a critical factor in the investment programme of the government. A more accu\u00adrate forecasting of potential receipts of foreign finance is, thus, not merely important from the point of view of financing the budgetary needs of the government but also from the point of view of its significance for the amount of public sector investment.",

The international monetary system was in great turmoil. The general inflationary conditions abroad and the resulting price increases of essential commodities have not only placed a severe burden on the country's resources, but also have made the task of budgeting a particularly difficult one. The sharply escalating prices of food imports have meant that the budgetary outlays on the food subsidy have not only increased but proved difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty. While referring to the some\u00adwhat inadequate performance in the first year of the Five-Year Plan, the Finance Minister noted that the second year of the Plan reflected a definite improve\u00adment of performance. He anticipated a growth-rate of 5 per cent in 1973 and an enhanced rate of 7 to 8 per cent in 1974 Emphasis has been placed on the importance of achieving a current account surplus of a reasonable magnitude and on meeting the public sector's investment targets as set out in the Five-Year Plan.",

The budget proposals were, therefore, primarily concerned with the rationalization of the tax system, the introduction of certain institutional changes and the provision of reliefs to alleviate hardships that have arisen in the recent past.",

As in 1973, a provision of Rs. 100 million has been made for the anticipated net payment on account of 'Advance Accounts' operations.

In pursuance of this objective, it was decided to withdraw the general services grant and the grant for payment of allowances to employees and pensioners in local bodies.1 To compensate for this loss in resources, it was proposed that initially, the Inland Revenue Department refund i per cent of the turnover tax collected on non-manufacturing business to local authorities through the Commissioner of Local Government. Such refunds would be on the basis of the returns furnished to the Department of Inland Revenue by the tax payers. This measure is to be an interim one until the local authorities themselves are in a position to compile their own registers and levy the equivalent of this \u00a3 per cent direct through licence fees or in other forms.",

In order to combat this evasion, it was proposed that from the year of assessment 1974/75, the rate of tax on gifts in excess of Rs. 1,000 and less than Rs. 50,000 will be fixed at 3 per cent. For similar reasons, the rate of stamp duty on transfers of property less than Rs. 50,000 in value was also to be fixed at 3 per cent. Consequently, there will be no liability for gifts tax on gifts of property of this magnitude as the stamp duty paid would be allowed to be set off against the gifts tax payable, as is done currently. The revenue from such gifts that accrued under gifts tax will thereafter accrue as stamp duty. At present, the rate of stamp duty on a gift of property where the value exceeds Rs. 1,000 and is less than 50,000, is Rs. 15 plus 1-6 per cent of the value of the property, while the gifts tax is 5 per cent of the value of the gift.",

The Finance Minister in his budget proposals for 1974 stated his intention to make it obligatory for each corporation or statutory board to lay its annual budget before the National State Assembly before the commencement of the financial year to which the budget relates. The corporation budget will be placed before the Assembly by the Minister in charge. The proposal is to be implemented from the commencement of 1975.
