Capital formation in the government sector increased by Rs. 73 million while capital formation in the private sector (including public sector corporations) increased by Rs. 214 million. As stated earlier, these increases should be also viewed in the light of the large increases in the prices of imported and locally produced goods. The Central Bank indices of import prices of investment goods stood at 139-9 (1967=100-0) in 1973 as compared to 120-3 in 1972, an increase of 16-2 per cent. Thus in real terms it is estimated that, fixed capital formation increased by a much smaller rate of about 2 per cent in 1973.",
