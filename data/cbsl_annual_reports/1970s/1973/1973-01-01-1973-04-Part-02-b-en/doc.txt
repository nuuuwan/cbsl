1. Agricultural Production

( i ) Significant Policy Changes

Several new measures were taken to achieve self-sufficiency in food and to promote the development of domestic agriculture.

The Paddy Producers Savings Law, No. 9 of 1973 authorized the Paddy Marketing Board to make certain prescribed deductions from the payments made to the producer for the paddy sold to the Board, and to credit these deductions to individual savings accounts in the names of the producers. These sums were to be paid to the producers on their reaching the age of 60 years (55 in the case o females) or when they cease to be producers due to a change of occupationf physical incapacity or emigration from Sri Lanka.

The Agricultural Insurance Law, No. 27 of 1973 sought to establish an Agricultural Insurance Board for operating a comprehensive agricultural insurance scheme for specified crops and livestock in order to indemnify farmers against losses from crop failure, stabilize farm incomes and promote agricultural production. This law provides, inter alia, for the payment of premia in the form of money or kind. Proceeds from the sale of crops under the Guaranteed Price Scheme could also be utilized to meet the payment of premia.

The Agricultural Lands Law, No. 42 of 1973 replaced the Paddy Lands Act, No. 1 of 1958 and provided for the security of tenure of tenant cultivators

of paddy lands, the specification of rent payable by tenant cultivators to the landlord, the establishment of cultivation committees and the determiantion of tenurial and other disputes in respect of all agricultural lands by agricultural tribunals. The cultivation committees were to function as agents of productivity committees that were established under the: Agricultural Productivity Law (see below) and were to perform their functions in respect of all agricultural lands.

The Sale of State Lands ( Special Provisions ) Law, No. 43 of 1973 provides for the systematic sale of state land to certain prescribed classes of persons for the purpose of agricultural development and for the repeal of certain provisions in the Land Development Ordinance.

The laws mentioned above were passed in 1973. The more important laws pertaining to agricultural development passed in 1972 were the Land Reform Law, No. 1 of 1972 and the Agricultural Productivity Law, No. 2 of 1972. The Land Reform Law established a Land Reform Commission and provided for the vesting of certain agricultural lands in the Land Reform Commission. The Commission was to dispose of the land in a manner that would increase productivity and employment.

( 36 )

A preliminary estimate of the extent of land that would come under the Land Reform Law is about 450,000 acres. By the end of 1973, 295,000 acres (or 65-6 per cent) have been vested in the Commission. Details regarding land which has already been alienated to various statutory bodies and organizations by the Commission are as follows:

Acres

State Plantations Corporation

( mainly tea and rubber ) 5,914 Udarata Cooperative Development

Board (mainly tea) 5,487 Coconut Cultvation Board

(mainly coconut) 287 Government Departments 224 Private Organizations 100 Under District Land Reform Authorities 1,007 Land Reform Commission Cooperatives 4,173 Multipurpose Cooperative Societies 2,135

19,327

The above table shows that 6 • 6 per cent of the lands vested have been alienated. In addition, approximately 1,680 acres of land had been recommended for sale in 1973.

The Agricultural Productvity Law, No. 2 of 1972 sought to provide for maximum productivity of agricultural land through their proper use and management. It also provided for the efficient management of agricultural crops and livestock and for the establishment of productivity committees and agricultural tribunals. The law imposed obligations on owners and occupiers to cultivate land in an optimal manner to which end the Minister of Agriculture and Lands may at his discretion direct the use of specified strains of crops and breeds of livestock, determine cropping patterns and methods of cultivation and, among others, prescribe the rules for water management and soil conservation. Agricultural productivity committees, established under this Productivity Law, were to be appointed by the Minister. These committees were to consist of not more than 10 persons representing the interests of those engaged in agriculture (or such other persons the Minister may think necessary). They were also to be charged with the duty of coordinating and developing agriculture. To enable the productivity committees to discharge their functions effectively they have been given powers to acquire and dispose of property, obtain and provide information for the formulation of agricultural policies, propose schemes, collect an acreage tax upto Rs. 6/- per acre per year, and assist the Bank of Ceylon in determining the creditworthiness of applicants for loans, among others.

Each agricultural productivity committee was to have for its use the facilities of an agricultural service centre. In all 438 agricultural service centres (each centre to roughly serve a village committee area) are to be established, of which 83 were established in 1973. Each such centre was to have a Bank of

( 37 )

Ceylon sub-office, an agricultural extension office, a sales room and an agricultural tribunal. These centres were also to provide centralized marketing, crop insurance and other services, under the direction of the productivity committee.

Emergency regulations were issued under the Public Security Ordinance cited as the Emergency (Cultivation of Food Crops) Regulations No. 1 of 1973. The primary objective of the food production programme undertaken under these regulations was to bring under cultivation " all cultivable land " with specified types of food crops. These regulations cast a duty on every owner or occupier of uncultivated land to cuitivate paddy, manioc, sweet potato, yams, etc. under threat of dispossession and transfer of land to persons willing and able to undertake cultivation of these crops. Provision was made for lands to be restored to owners/occupiers under certain circumstances, and for the payment to the former owner or occupier of a fair ground rent by the new cultivator. A District Political Authority was to head a committee comprising members of the National State Assembly, with a view to organizing and co-ordinating the food production programme and mobilising mass support.

( i i ) Performance

(a) Paddy Subsector:

The data on the performance of the paddy subsector in Maha1 1972/73 and Yala 1973 are given in table II ( B ) 1.

Maha 1972/73: The acreage sown in Maha 1972/73 was 1-2 million or almost the same as the acreage sown in the, preceding five Maha seasons, and 0-6 percent less than the extent sown in Maha 1971/72. The net area harvested during the season was 4 • 8 percent more than the area harvested in the previous Maha. The area not harvested in Maha 1972/73 was 8-0 percent of the area sown. This is significantly less than the corresponding figure of 12-7 percent for the previous Maha season, but roughly equivalent to the average extents not harvested in the previous five Maha seasons.

An increase in the acreage harvested by 4-8 per cent in Maha 1972/73 over the previous Maha season was not matched by a commensurate increase in total production, which increased by 0-4 per cent. This was due to a 5 • 4 per cent decline in yields in Maha 1972/73 from 48-1 bushels in Maha 1971/72 to 45-5 bushels in Maha 1972/73. The decline in the yield could be attributed primarily to adverse weather conditions. To some extent the latter may account for the insignificant increase of 0-2 per cent in fertilizer issues2 and the decrease of 0-7 per cent in the area under improved varieties.

1' The cultivation year comprises two seasons. Maha and Yala. Maha extends from Septemfcer October to March/April, Yala from April/May to August/September.

2. Since the data refer to fertilizer issues through multipurpose cooperatives and not to actual application of fertilizer in paddy cultivation, the data may be inadequate for explaining changes in yield.

Yala 1Q73: The acreage sown in Yala 1973 was 0-6 million, which was roughly half the extent sown in the preceding Maha season. The acreage sown in Yala 1973 is 0-8 percent more than the acreage sown in the previous Yala season, but not significantly different from the average acreage sown in the previous five Yala seasons. The net area harvested in Yala 1973 increased by 5-7 per cent over the previous Yala season, and 0-9 per cent over the average acreage harvested in the period 1968-1972. In 1973 the area not harvested was 6-3 per cent of the area sown. This shortfall was less than the shortfall in Yala 1972, which was 10-7 per cent, but roughly equivalent to the average shortfall in the five year period 1968-1972.

The 5 • 7 per cent increase in the area harvested in Yala 1973 was not matched by a corresponding increase in production (which increased by only 1-6 per cent). This disproportion is accounted for by the fall in yield by 4 per cent from 44'5 bushels per acre in Yala 1972 to 42-8 bushels per acre in Yala 1973. Since the data show that fertilizer issued1 in Yala 1973 increased by 45-0 per cent and the area under improved varieties by 0-5 per cent, the fall in yields was probably due, among others, to such factors as delays in the supply of fertilizer and other inputs to farmers, and leakages of fertilizer to other crops.

Cultivation Year 1972/73: Taking the cultivation year 1972/73 as a whole, a cropping index2 of 152-0 for 1972/73 indicates that land use intensity during the year has remained essentially unchanged when compared to the average cropping index of 152-3 for the five year period 1967/68-1971/72, but has increased slightly over the figure of 151 -3 for the previous cultivation year. Total paddy production in the 1972/73 cultivation year was 62.9 million bushels and production in the year did not differ significantly from the corresponding figure for the previous year. The average yield in the cultivation year 1972/73 was 44.7 bushels per acre as against 46 • 6 bushels per acre in the previous year. This represents a fall in yield of 4-1 per cent from the previous year. Of the total acreage harvested in the 1972/73 cultivation year, 38-4 per cent was in the wet zone and 61-6 per cent in the dry zone, while 35-1 per cent of total production was from the wet zone and 64.9 from the dry zone. The higher yield of 46-9 bushels per acre realized in the dry zone, as against 40 • 8 bushels per acre in the wet zone, accounts for this. The higher yield in the dry zone is consistent with relatively higher fertilizer issues (60 • 4 per cent of total issues) and the relatively larger area under improved varieties (70-9 percent of the total area) in that zone.

1- The same factors mentioned earlier limit the acceptability of this statistic for explaining yields. 2- The cropping index is computed by taking the percentage of the Maha season acreage that is sown in Yala and adding the result to 100.

( 40 )

Maha 1973I74: Of a total area of 1,080,125 acres sown in Maha 1973/74 up to

31st December, 1973, 81*1 per cent was under improved varieties. The acreage sown in Maha 1973/74 shows an increase of 4.2 per cent over the extent sown in the corresponding period of the preceding year. The area under improved seed varieties up to 31st December, 1973, also shows an increase of 14.0 per cent over the area under improved seed varieties in the corresponding period in the previous Maha season.

Purchase under the Guaranteed Price Scheme (GPS): In Maha 1972/73 paddy purchases under GPS were 18-7 million bushels or 44-5 per cent of total paddy production, while purchases in Maha 1971/72 were 19-0 million bushels or

45'0 per cent. Of the GPS purchases in Maha 1972/73, 87.5 per cent was from the dry zone.

In Yala 1973, GPS purchases of paddy were 4-0 million bushels or 18-9 per cent of total production as against 7-2 million bushels or 34-8 per cent in the previous Yala season. Of the GPS purchases in Yala 1973, 79-0 per cent was from the dry zone.

In the cultivation year 1972/73 the purchases under the GPS were 36-0 per cent of the total production as against 41-6 percent in the previous cultivation year. In absolute terms there was a decrease of 13-5 per cent in the quantity of paddy purchased from 26-2 million bushels in the 1971/72 cultivation year to

22-6 million bushels in the 1972/73 cultivation year. The decrease in purchases under the GPS may be attributed to an increasing divergence between the guaranteed price and the market price which reduced the effectiveness of the guaranteed price as a floor price.

In the cultivation year 1972/73, the acreage under the first nine crops itemized in the table (in respect of which complete data on the area cultivated for both years are available) increased by 68-5 per cent over the previous year. The acreage under manioc, maize, chillies and kurakkan in 1972/73 was 86-7 per cent of the total acreage cultivated under the crops listed in the table excluding soya bean and potatoes1. With regard to manioc, maize and red onions, the proportiona­tely smaller increase in production in the cultivation year 1972/73 when compared to the increase in the acreage cultivated could be attributed primarily to: (a) the marginal nature of the new lands brought under cultivation; (b) the lack of adequate technical knowledge of cultivation of new crops by first-time cultivators; (c) relatively more adverse weather conditions when compared to the previous year.

1- These two crops are excluded due to the incomplete nature ot the data available.

2. Rural Banking and Credit

In 1973, institutional credit to the rural sector was channeled primarily through the New Agricultural Credit Scheme, the cooperative rural banks and the Bank of Ceylon sub-offices at agricultural service centres. A scheme referred to as the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme was introduced in 1973, and was to operate through rural banks attached to multipurpose cooperative societies. Some provisions of this Scheme were also to apply to the existing New Agricultural Credit Scheme and the Bank of Ceylon scheme in Maha 1973/74. The loans disbursed under the three schemes during the year amounted to Rs. 138.6 million. In addition, credit to the rural sector was provided by schemes operated by government departments for specific purposes, by commercial banks and by specialised credit institutions.

On behalf of the government, the Central Bank guarantees cultivation loans for specified crops given under the above schemes to the extent of 75 per cent of the amount in default.

(i) The Provisions of the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme

The Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme was designed to meet, in a consolidated manner, all the credit requirements of the rural sector. The salient changes introduced by this Scheme are as follows.-

1. The facilities are channeled through cooperative rural banks of the multipurpose cooperative societies where such banks have been established. In situations where rural banks have not been established or have not begun implementing the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme, the People's Bank channels cultivation loans directly through multi­purpose cooperatives as in the past. However, in determining the size of loans for various crops the People's Bank is guided by the loan limits approved under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme.

2. Where rural banks exist, credit was to be provided on a year-round basis, for production as well as consumption, housing, debt redemption and emergencies Integral links between rural savings and rural credit were to be fostered by the mobilisation of agricultural sale proceeds and other rural funds.

3. The credit limits under the Scheme were variable depending on the purpose and the region. Where rural banks operate the decisions with regard to credit disbursement as well as supervision of the end use of loans are decentralised. The allocation of the proceeds of an agricultural loan among operations, except for the amount of credit earmarked for fertilizer and agro-chemicals, may be changed con­sidering the needs of a locality. The credit limits.as. applicable tojthe scale of finance ate given in tables 63 to 69 in appendix III.

( 43 )

Some important improvements in this Scheme.are as follows:

1. The tailoring of loan ceilings to suit particular regions, seed varieties and crops will enable the loans to be geared to different production requirements and thus increase the degree of economic rationality in the allocation of resources.

2. One major reason for the failure of the New Agricultural Credit Scheme was that the financing institution did not have sufficient direct authority for effecting recoveries of loans. The Comprehensive Scheme, in contrast, is designed to operate through rural banks and Bank of Ceylon sub-offices by mobilising rural funds. These institutions will eventually lend their own funds and exercise the responsibility to recover them.

All credit schemes have been beset with the problem of having to lend to uncreditworthy borrowers on account of the objective of maintaining a high level of production in traditional agriculture. At least in the initial stages the Comprehensive Scheme is bound to be affected by this problem.

(ii) New Agricultural Credit Scheme

The New Agricultural Credit Scheme of 1967 will also be in operation in areas where rural banks have not yet been established as departments of multipurpose cooperative societies or where these banks have not commenced implementing the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme. In such circumstances the multipurpose cooperative will help to channel the loans disbursed by the People's Bank in terms of the enhanced ceilings approved under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme. The provisions of the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme on consumption loans and savings mobilisation will not be implemented where tural banks do not operate.

Although the rural bank and Bank of Ceylon sub-office network has expanded considerably, the New Agricultural Credit Scheme continued to be the main source of cultivation loans. Out of a total sum of Rs. 102.4 million given for paddy and subsidiary crops during the year 1973, Rs. 97.8 million was given under this Scheme.

(a) Paddy Loans:

Under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme, the amount of loans granted, the method and extent of recovery, the extension of the period of repayment of loans on account of crop failure and the extent of default, are given in table II (B) 3.

The trend towards a lower rate of loan utilization that commenced from the very inception of the New Agricultural Credit Scheme continued in the Maha 1972/73 season, with loans granted declining by 15.-4- per cent below the sum disbur­sed in the previous Maha season. Credit utilization in Yala 1973 increased by 17.9 per cent over the amount utilized in the previous Yala season. Credit utilization in the 1972/73 cultivation year (for both Maha 1972/73 and Yala 1973) wasRs. 19.5 million or 61.2 per cent less than the Rs. 72-7 million utilized at the inception of the scheme in the 1967/68 cultivation year. This decline may be attributed to

increases in default which rendered an increasing number of cultivators ineligible for credit1. Unfavourable weather conditions may have also influenced thj extent of contraction in credit utilization in the 1972/73 cultivation year.

Although figures for Maha 1973/74 are incomplete, credit disbursements show a sharp reversal of the declining trend, with credit utilization increasing by 200-0 per cent from Rs. 20-3 million to Rs. 60-9million in the precetding Maha season. This figure is expected to increase even further as additional funds are released during the cultivation season, which is currently in progress. The increase is primarily attributable to: (a) the upward revision of credit limits permitted under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme from an unweighted average of Rs. 316 per acre to Rs. 385 per acre; (b) defaulting borrowers who were disqualified from borrowing becoming eligible once again to receive partial credit for fertilizer and agrochemicals besides Rs. 100 per acre (upto a maximum of Rs. 300) for all other purposes;2 (c) the increase in the number of new culti­vators seeking loans due to the emphasis on food production and the increased profitability of investment in agriculture.

With regard to loan repayments, 56.6 per cent of the Maha 1972/73 loans were repaid as compared to 57-5 per cent in Maha 1971/72. In view of the incomplete nature of the loan recovery figure for Yala 1973, the credit recovery rate of 36-7 percentdoes not indicate the actual amount in default. It is expected that the credit recovery rate for Maha 1973/74 may improve for the reasons indicated above.

The district-wise breakdown of credit utilization and recovery leves of paddy loans in Maha 1972/73 and Yala 1973 are given in table 70 n appendix III In the cultivation year.1972/73 the highest amount of loans was (.ranted in the Polonnaruwa district where disbursements amounted to Rs. 6.1 n ill on and constituted 21-5 per cent of all loans. Badulla district had the highest recoveries with a rate of 90-9 per cent in Maha 1972/73. (b) Loans for Subsidary Food Crops Particulars on the loans disbursed for subsidiary food crops are given in table II (B) 4. Details of loan limits for various crops3 in terms of the scale of finance approved by the Ministry of Agriculture are in Tables 68 and 69 in appendix III. Of the credit given for subsidiary crops in 1972/73 the largest disbursement was for potatoes (Rs. 4-4 million) which constituted 43 -5 per cent of the total amount granted for all subsidiary food crops. In 1972/73 there was a 7-2 per cent increase in the loans granted for subsidiaiy food crops over the amount disbursed in the previous year. The incomplete loan disbursement figure for 1973/74 indicates a significant rise (21-7 per cent) in credit disburse­ments for these crops. This increase may be attributed to the profitability of investment in these crops and the general emphasis placed on agricultural production.-

1. The rtasons for the hiah rate of default areexplainedin the "Central Bank Survey of Defaults In the Repayment of New Agricultural Loans," Department, of Economic Research, 1972. 2. Defaulting borrowers were given a three-year extension for the tepa>roent of overdue loars. These loans were to be repaid in three to six equal instalments cemmercirg Maha 1973/74. The inte-est due on these loans wtre frozen with effect frcm August 1973 as a measure of relief and as an inducement for the [tpayment of the loans tal en earlier. 3. Credit facilites. becked by the government guar-ntee of uj-to 75% of deftults, were made available for 12 subsidiary Crops at increased limits in January 1974.

The percentage of loans repaid has declined by 7-9 percent in 1971/72 frcm the figure for recoveries for the previous year. The percentage of loans recovered in 1972/73 however does not indicate the true recovery rate in view of the incomplete nature of the data.

With regard to the district-wise breakdown of loans for subsidiaiy crops (vide table 71 in appendix III), the information reflects the regional specialization in the cultivation of particular crops. A substantial portion of the total loans given for chillies (55-0 per cent) and onions (87-4 per cent) went to the Jaffna district, while 50-8 per cent of the loans for potatoes went to the Nuwara Eliya district and 55-4 per cent of the loans for vegetables to the Badulla district, (iii) Rural Banks

To implement the government decison to channel loans under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme through rural banks attached to multipurpose cooperative societies, the number of rural banks increased from 242 in 31st, December 1972 to 341 a year later. The deposits and advances of the rural banks are presented in table II (B) 5.

The data in table II ( B ) 5 show savings mobilization amounting toRs. 45'2 million, which represents an increase of 93-6 per cent over the savings mobilized in the previous year. The total loans disbursed against the savings mobilizi d shows a net deposit position of Rs. 2 9 0 million. This constitutes an improvement by Rs. 13.9 million over the net deposit position in the previous year. There has also been a 36 • 2 per cent increase in the average net deposit for all rural banks (which increased from Rs. 62,372 to Rs. 84,976 per bank). With regard to pawn broking, the amount of credit granted against the value of assets(jewellery)pledged increased by 226 7 per cent over the previous year. In 1973 advances under pawn broking constituted 58-4 percent of all advances, as against 45 8 per cent in 1972.

As shown in table II (B) 6, the loans granted for all purposes in 1973 have ncreased by 96-6 per cent over the amount disbursed in 1972. Production loans have increased by 254 r 8 percent and consumption1 loans by 65-7 per cent. While Rs. 4-4 million was given for production purposes, the amount given for consumption purposes1 was Rs. 10-2 million.

The data on the district-wise position of deposits1 and advances are in table 72 in appendix III. Except for Batticaloa, all other districts show a positive net deposit position. The rural banks in the Ratnapura district have the largest net deposits (Rs; 7-3 million) which constitutes 25-1 per cent of total net deposits. The net deposits in Colombo and Ratnapura districts together make-up 44-9 per cent of total net deposits. With regard to pawn-broking the advances against the value of assets (jewellery) pledged was highest in the Colombo district, constituting 22*6 per cent of all advances in this category.

In terms of savings mobilization (the net deposit position) the data show a significant improvement in the performance of rural banks. The success in this regard probably reflects both an increased efficacy in the opetations of rural banks and an increased availability of resources in the rural sector resulting from the emphasis in policy on increasing agricultural production.

(iv) Bank of Ceylon Rural Credit Scheme

In 1973, Bank of Ceylon sub-offices had been opened in 19 out of 83 agricultural service centres. The Agricultural Productivity Law of 1972, which sought to ensure maximum productivity in agriculture, provided for the eventual establishment of 438 agricultural service centres to roughly coincide with each village committee area. At each of these Centres the Bank of Ceylon was to provide credit facilities in consultation with the members of these service centres and the productivity committees.

* Funds loaned on the basis of cultivation programmes in terms of the scale of finance, the operational breakdown of which is shown in Table Nos. 63 to 69 in appendix III.

Facilities to be provided by the Bank of Ceylon at these agricultural service centres were to include current accounts, savings accounts, special savings accounts (with the facility for withdrawal by cheque), branch advices, fixed deposits, loans, overdrafts, mail transfers, drafts and claim vouchers on other banks. Special emphasis was to be given to the needs of agriculture and small industry by mobilising savings and providing credit in rural areas. Advances were to be provided for the following purposes:

(a) production, harvesting and marketing of agricultural crops,

(b) purchase of agricultural tractors, irrigation pump sets and other farm equipment and implements,

(c) digging wells,

(d) developing new lands for agricultural purposes,

(e) crop diversification,

(f) development of dairy and poultry projects, and

(g) consumption advances, including the redemption of debts.

Applications for loans and advances are to be entertained only from account holders in the sub-office, and the period and limit of the loan was to vary with the purpose of the loan. Cultivation loans are to be given in stages to coincide with different farm operations, and the maximum durations of these cultivation loans were to be confined to the cultivation cycle. The interest (upto a maximum of 9 per cent per annum) and principal have to be repaid after the crop is harvested. The rate of interest on loans other than for cultivation varies from 6-5 to 12 per cent per annum depending on the purpose and the collateral.

The creditworthiness of borrowers was to be determined by the Bank of Ceylon sub-office with the assistance of officers attached to the service centre and members of the agricultural productivity committee, cultivation committee and from information in the Agro-Identity Card issued to each applicant by the productivity committee. The honesty and integrity of the borrower and the prospective economic viability of the project are the basic requirements for determining the security of loans to be granted.

For loan ceilings for cultivation purposes the Bank is guided by the scale of finance as approved by the Ministry of Agriculture. These ceilings are classified by purpose in tables 63- 69 in appendix III, and are the same as those applicable to loans granted under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme.

In this Scheme there are features which are favourable to the efficient use of loans granted and a lower rate of default. These include making the sub-office responsible for determining the eligibility of applicants for loans, the utilization of the facilities of the service centre for supervision of the end use of loans and their recovery and the establishment of a means of determining a borrower's credit rating. The latter will act as a deterrent to the 'misuse' of loaned funds and will be of considerable use in assessing future loan applications.

Asseen in table II (B) 7, by far the largest ^proportion of loans given (83-75 per cent) is for production in terms of the cultivation programme, of which the dominant component (81-78 per cent) is for paddy. The second most important purpose for which funds have been loaned is housing (3-79 per cent). If the total amount of loans is classified into broad categories of production1 and consumption2, 87-25 per cent of the loans are for production and 7-33 per cent for consumption, with 5-42 per cent for trade and other purposes.

District-wise analysis

The district-wise position is given in table 73 in appendix III.

Seventy nine sub-offices have been opened in 16 of the 22 districts with the largest number (19) in the Anuradhapura district. The largest amount of deposits is Rs. 900,431 in the 12 branches in the Kandy district, while the deposits in the Anuradhapura district amounted to Rs. 854,650. The highest amount of loan disbursements made by a single branch was in the Ratnapura district (Rs.852,209).

1. The citegories included are: production, purchase of machinery and equipment, digging of wells, deve'oping new lands, crop diversification, dairy farming and poultry farming. %. The categories included are; debt redemption, housing, electrification and consumption.

In all districts. savings mobilization as at 31st December 1973 amounted to Rs. 3'01 million while loans granted were Rs. 1-83 million (Table II (B) 8) If total advances (including overdrafts) are subtracted from total deposits (including current account balances) the net deposit position is Rs. 3-55 million.

(v) Overall Assessment of Rural Credit

The overall position is presented in tables II ( B ) 9 and 11(B) 10. In 1973 of a total credit disbursement of Rs. 138-6 million, the'largest amount (73-9 per cent) was for production in terms of the farmers'cultivation programmes. About 75 per cent of loans was for production1 while the proportion of loans for all consumption2 is about 8 per cent; The small proportion (1-3 per cent) of loans given by the Bank of Ceylon is attributable to the fact that its loans for cultivation purposes (under the scale of finance approved by the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme) commenced only in November 1973,

From a district-wise standpoint (table II (B) 10) positive net balances are evident only in Colombo and Ratnapura. The ratio' of deposits (excluding current account balances) to loans (excluding overdrafts) is 0-3.
