This disproportion is accounted for by the fall in yield by 4 per cent from 44'5 bushels per acre in Yala 1972 to 42-8 bushels per acre in Yala 1973. Since the data show that fertilizer issued1 in Yala 1973 increased by 45-0 per cent and the area under improved varieties by 0-5 per cent, the fall in yields was probably due, among others, to such factors as delays in the supply of fertilizer and other inputs to farmers, and leakages of fertilizer to other crops.",

    "text": "Cultivation Year 1972/73: Taking the cultivation year 1972/73 as a whole, a cropping index2 of 152-0 for 1972/73 indicates that land use intensity during the year has remained essentially unchanged when compared to the average cropping index of 152-3 for the five year period 1967/68-1971/72, but has increased slightly over the figure of 151 -3 for the previous cultivation year. Total paddy production in the 1972/73 cultivation year was 62.9 million bushels and production in the year did not differ significantly from the corresponding figure for the previous year. The average yield in the cultivation year 1972/73 was 44.7 bushels per acre as against 46 \u2022 6 bushels per acre in the previous year. This represents a fall in yield of 4-1 per cent from the previous year. Of the total acreage harvested in the 1972/73 cultivation year, 38-4 per cent was in the wet zone and 61-6 per cent in the dry zone, while 35-1 per cent of total production was from the wet zone and 64.9 from the dry zone. The higher yield of 46-9 bushels per acre realized in the dry zone, as against 40 \u2022 8 bushels per acre in the wet zone, accounts for this. The higher yield in the dry zone is consistent with relatively higher fertilizer issues (60 \u2022 4 per cent of total issues) and the relatively larger area under improved varieties (70-9 percent of the total area) in that zone.",

This figure is expected to increase even further as additional funds are released during the cultivation season, which is currently in progress. The increase is primarily attributable to: (a) the upward revision of credit limits permitted under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme from an unweighted average of Rs. 316 per acre to Rs. 385 per acre; (b) defaulting borrowers who were disqualified from borrowing becoming eligible once again to receive partial credit for fertilizer and agrochemicals besides Rs. 100 per acre (upto a maximum of Rs. 300) for all other purposes;2 (c) the increase in the number of new culti\u00advators seeking loans due to the emphasis on food production and the increased profitability of investment in agriculture.",

(b) Loans for Subsidary Food Crops Particulars on the loans disbursed for subsidiary food crops are given in table II (B) 4. Details of loan limits for various crops3 in terms of the scale of finance approved by the Ministry of Agriculture are in Tables 68 and 69 in appendix III. Of the credit given for subsidiary crops in 1972/73 the largest disbursement was for potatoes (Rs. 4-4 million) which constituted 43 -5 per cent of the total amount granted for all subsidiary food crops. In 1972/73 there was a 7-2 per cent increase in the loans granted for subsidiaiy food crops over the amount disbursed in the previous year. The incomplete loan disbursement figure for 1973/74 indicates a significant rise (21-7 per cent) in credit disburse\u00adments for these crops. This increase may be attributed to the profitability of investment in these crops and the general emphasis placed on agricultural production.-",
