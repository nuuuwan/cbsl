1. Introduction

Data on employment and unemployment in Sri Lanka have not been collected on a regular basis other than from sample surveys undertaken at infrequent intervals. Although comprehensive statistics would be available from the 1971 census this data have not yet been released. However, according to the survey on labour force participation rates undertaken by the Central Bank in 1973 the labour force, consisting of employed and unemployed persons, was 44*8 per cent of the sampled population. In this survey housewives were treated as employed persons. If housewives are excluded from this category the labour force constitutes 34-4 per cent of the sample. The latter may be compared with the estimated labour force participation rate of 33 • 6 per cent derived from the Socio-Economic Survey of Ceylon, 1969/70.

According to the labour force participation survey 17*4 per cent of the labour force (excluding the housewives) was unemployed. When the sample estimates are blown up for the mid-year population of 1973 the employed and unemployed are estimated at 3,757,000 and 793,000 respectively.

On a monthly basis, the only available figures on unemployment are those

of the number of registrants at the employment exchanges in the island. As these unemployment figures are incomplete the Central Bank has endeavoured to supplement this.data by conducting an annual inquiry into employment in the public sector. The Bank has also obtained information on employees registered under Employees Provident Fund (E. P. F.). The latest' available E. P. F. data are for the year 1972. Data on employment had also been obtained from a number

of other provident funds which are outside the E. P. F. scheme and are referred to as Approved Private Provident Funds (A. P. P. F.). The employees in these funds include the staff of some of the large corporations and institutions such as Ceylon Transport Board and the Ceylon Electricity Board.

In 1973, there were 238 strikes in the private sector of which 215 were in the plantations and 23 in other employments. In addition on the 18th December,

1973 the plantation workers came out on a three day token strike, but the strike continued until 28th December, 1973. The number of workers involved in the strike and the number of man-days lost have not yet been computed.

2. Number placed in the employment by Employment Exchanges

The annual figures of the number of persons placed in employment by employment exchanges from 1961 to 1973 are given in table II ( J ) 1. The total number of persons placed in employment by the employment exchanges in 1973 was 2,622. For all categories of workers the numbers placed in employment in

1973 were 20-4 per cent less than in the previous year.

3. Employment in the Public Sector

The response to the annual survey conducted by the Central Bank on employment in semi-government institutions (public corporations, universities, research institutes, statutory boards, etc.) and government service, for the year 1973, was unsatisfactory. About 18 semi-government institutions did not respond and employment in these institutions had to be estimated. Figures for those government departments which did not respond to the inquiry were obtained from the Estimates of Government Revenue and Expenditure for 1973, which gave the approved cadre, but not necessarily the numbers in actual employment.

The employees are classified according to categories and status (permanent, temporary and casual). The categories considered were:

1. Administrative, technical and professional officers of staff rank; 2. Subordinate employees; 3. Minor employees; 4. School teachers (in the case of government departments); 5. Others.

(a) Government Departments

The estimates of employment in government departments for the years 1972 and 1973 are given by the table II ( J ) 2.

In 1973 the total number of employees in government departments had increased by 8 • 0 per cent. The increase in the number of employees in the sub­ordinate grades was the highest recorded and exceeded the figure for 1972 by 11 • 4 per cent. Employees in the administrative grades, minor employees and school teachers increased by 10-3, 7-1 and 5-8 per cent, respectively, in 1973.

( 213 )

In 1973, about 60 per cent of the total number of employees in government departments were in the subordinate and minor grades. Of the total number of employees 28 per cent were government school teachers while officers in staff rank were 3 • 4 per cent.

The percentage of permanent employees in government departments decreased from 88-1 per cent in 1972 to 86-8 per cent in 1973, while the number of temporary employees increased from 5-9 to 6-1 per cent. Casual employees increased from 5 • 9 to 7 • 1 per cent in the course of the year.

(b) Semi - Government Institutions

The estimates of employment in semi - government institutions are given below in the table II (J) 3.

( 215 )

The rate of absorption of new entrants in semi-government institutions declined in 1973, the rate fell in 1972 from 13-1 per cent of the total number in employment to 4-6 per cent in 1973. This decline in the percentage increase in the number of employees occured in all the categories except in the category of subordinate employees. In the latter category the increase,was 11.5 per cent. In

1973 the number of employees in staff rank and minor grades increased by 7-2 and 6>4 per cent, respectively, while the corresponding figures for 1972 were 16-0 and 20 • 5 per cent respectively. .

Of the total number of employees in semi-government institutions about 84 per cent were in the permanent cadre while casual.and temporary workers accounted for about 10 and 5 per cent respectively.

4. ( a ) Employees registered under the Employees' Provident Fund

The latest available figures of the number of employments and the number

of employees registered under the E. P. F. are for the year 1972.

In 1972 a total of 38,485 employments contributed to the E. P. F. as compared to 34,460 in 1971; an increase of 12 per cent. The employees registered with the E. P. F. have been classified according to the main industrial categories in table II (J) 4, for the years 1968 to 1972.

Number of employees registered under the E.P.F. according to District and Industry for 1972

( 217 )

The total number of employees registered under the E. P. F. rose from 1,957,239 in 1971 to 2,074,398 in 1972 or by 6-0 per cent. The largest increase was in mining and quarrying (82 per cent). The increases in non-plantation agriculture, trade and transport and manufacturing were 76, 14 and 11 per cent, respectively. Of the total number of registrants in 1972,64 per cent were in agriculture, 14 per cent in manufacturing and 13 per cent in trade and transport.

The distribution of employees registered under the E. P. F. according to industry and district, as at the end of 1972, is given in table II ( J ) 5.

The number of employees registered under the E. P. F. as an index of the level

of employment in the establishments covered by the Fund, in all likelihood, is too high. The reported figures include among the employed those who are no longer employed but continue to have an account with the Fund. In view of this a better index would be the number of employees who have made at least one contribution to the Fund in the course of the year. The E. P. F. refers to the latter figure as the number of active accounts.

Table II (J) 6 gives the number of active accounts with the E. P. F. during the year.

In 1972 the gap between the number of registrants and the number of active accounts was as much as 1,167,523. About 1,070,000 of the difference is estimated to be due to

(a) errant employers evading contributions

(b) some registrants being unemployed throughout the year, although the number falling into this category cannot be estimated.

( 218 )

While the number of registrants-shows an increase of 6 per cent in 1972, there was a decline of 2 per cent in the number of active accounts. This decline has been mainly due to the reduced number of active accounts in plantation agriculture* construction and manufacturing also declined during the year..

Both indices indicate considerable expansion in employment in mining and quarrying as well as in non-plantation agriculture.

4- (b) Employees in Approved Private Provident Funds (A. P. P. F\)

The response to a questionnaire sent by the Central Bankto these funds to furnish data on the number of members in the funds and their broad job classifications was very satisfactory. The industty-wise classification of employees registered under A. P. P. F: is given by the following table.

In 1973, the number of employees in A. P. P. F. had increased:by 2-8 per cent. The' largest increase during the year was in non-plantation agriculture

(23-9 per cent). There were substantial increases in mining &. quarrying (8 • 5 per cent), services (7*2 per cent) and manufacturing (6-5 per cent). However, the number of employees in plantation agriculture decreased by 3-3 per cent. The directions of change in employment in different industries were simitar to those shown by E. P^ F. data.

5. Registrants for Employment.

The number of registrants at employment exchanges for employment or better employment at the end of 1973 was 470,491 compared with 445,422 at the end of the previous year. In 1973, the number of registrants for technical and clerical employment decreased whilst in respect of all other categories the numbers increased. The same trend was observed for the year 1972 as well.

6. Labour Relations

The data for 1973 on the number of strikes, the number of workers involved

and the number of man-days lost in the private sector are given by the table II

(J) 9. As already mentioned the figures do not include data on the token strike

in the plantation sector in December 1973.

In 1973, the number of strikes in the plantation sector was 215 as compared

with 165 in 1972; an increase of 30 per cent. The number of workers involved

increased from 52,832 in 1972 to 89,393 in 1973. The increase in the number

of man-days lost during the year was 86,500. Among other employments the

number of workers on strike and the number of man-days lost increased by 2,058

and 5,371 respectively.

In 1973, as in the previous year, the demand for wage increases, as causes

for strikes were less important than the demands for improvements in general

working conditions. Nearly 61 per cent of the work stoppages wete on account

of demands for better working arrangements and disputes with junior staff.

Food matters accounted for 17 per cent while loss of employment accounted for

14 per cent of the total number of strikes in 1973.
