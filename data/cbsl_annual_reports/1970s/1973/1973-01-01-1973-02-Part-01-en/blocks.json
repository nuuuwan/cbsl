On the basis of a rate of increase in population in 1973 of 1 \u2022 76 per cent,1 the increase in per capita product at constant prices is 1.7 per cent. This should be compared with the very low increase in per capita real product of 0-6 per cent in 1972 and a negative growth rate of 1-9 per cent in 1971. The increment in the real national product was below expectations because of a substantial fall in the output of coconut and tea and to a lesser extent of livestock products. On the other hand the production of rubber, subsidiary .food crops and precious stones, increased appreciably. The output of paddy, which is the largest domestic agricultural crop, did not show an increase in the year. The value added in manufacturing in real terms increased marginally, while the level of activity in construction improved with a slight increase in the availability of raw materials.",

In addition, for the first time since 1968/69, the government was able to generate a surplus in its current account. There was a moderate increase in real capital expenditure over the previous year.

The Five Year Plan, which became operative in 1972, envisages a growth rate of 6 per cent on the average, and the rate of growth in 1973, therefore, falls far short of this target. However, the increase in per capita product at constant prices of 1 \u2022 7 per cent in 1973 shows some improvement as against the increase of 0-6 pet cent in 1972. This was not entirely due to a particularly better economic performance in 1973, but to an appreciable fall in the rate of population growth from 2-0 per cent in 1972 to 1-76 per cent in 1973. Although in money terms, the Gross National Product has increased by as much as 19-6 per cent, this figure is of no significance on account of the economic situation in 1973 when very large price increases occurred.",

    "text": "Being the second year of the Five Year Plan when the rate of increase in private consumption expenditure should have actually decreased to enable more savings to be diverted to investment, the year 1973, stands out on account of the exceedingly high level of private consumption expenditure in money terms. Whereas in 1972 consumption expenditure went up by 10-4 per cent, in 1973 it increased by 24.9 per cent. Of this, expenditure on locally produced goods and services increased by 32-1 per cent, while expenditure on imports of goods and services decreased by 11-9 per cent as against an increase of 16-4 per cent in the preceding year. The latter could be attributed, at least in part, to the continuing stringent supervision exercised over the foreign exchange allocations for all imports.",

In the budget for the financial year 1973, it was expected that the government's fiscal operations would require bank borrowings to the extent of Rs. 100 million. On the contrary, a substantial increase in revenue together with a record borrowing from domestic non-bank sources enabled the government to reduce its indebtedness to the banking system by Rs. 116 million. During the year, borrowings from the Central Bank increased by, Rs. 114 million and government's indebtedness to the commercial banks was reduced by Rs. 230 million while cash balances were drawn down by Rs 63 million.",

Income tax collections increased by Rs. 246 million, while business turnover tax collections increased by Rs. 142 million. The increase in income tax collections is partly accounted for by the carry over into 1973 of tax collections relating to 1972. The other increases in revenue were mostly the direct result of the budgetary measures aimed at mobilizing additional resources which were proposed in the budget speech for 1973. The increase in export duty collections was largely due to the high prices for exports, particularly rubber. On the other hand, there were slight decreases in revenue from import duties and profits from the sale of atrack.",

    "text": "Domestic non-bank market borrowing in 1973 reached a record Rs. 623 million (net.) Resources mobilized through the issue of rupee securities was Rs. 760 million, the entirety of which came from non-bank sources. This: is Rs, 240 million higher than the corresponding (pro-rata) amount for 1971/72. This successful mobilization of resources from the non-bank sector was largely aided by increased contributions from the National Savings Bank, sinking funds, the Employees' Provident Fund and the Insurance Corporation. In recent years, these captive sources have come to contribute almost 90 per cent of the total subscription to rupee securities. At a time when receipts of foreign finance have shown a tendency to decline, increased support from non-bank sources to the government loan programme, has helped the government in a large way, to sustain its investment programme. On the other hand, these increased borrowings have-led to a sharp increase in the interest cost of the public debt. The interest bill on both foreign and local debt which was Rs. 206 million in 1968/69 is estimated to be Rs. 602 million in 1974- These interest payments now constitute a signifi\u00adcant item of government recurrent expenditure, and is almost equal to the estimated gross food subsidy bill for 1974. It is imperative that if debt servicing is not to present a major problem to the government in the future, the return on investments made by the government should be adequately high to cover at least a substantial part of the cost of borrowing funds.",

    "text": "In October 1973, the government announced a package of proposals with a view to limiting the alarming rate of increase in the food subsidy bill. The issue of free rice to non-income taxpayers was reduced from one measure to half a measure. The price charged from income tax payers was fixed at Re. 1/- per half measure. Distribution of wheat flour was brought under the ration and its price increased to 70 cents per pound. The weekly ration was fixed at one pound per person. The quantum of sugar issued under the ration monthly was reduced from one pound to three-fourth pound per person and the off-ration price of sugar was increased to Rs. 2/- per pound. All these measures were to have resulted in a substantial savings in the food subsidy bill, while at the same time enhancing the profits from their sale. The full budgetary impact of these measures was expected to be felt in 1974. Unfortunately escalating import prices of rice, flour and sugar are now expected to more than wipe off any gains that would have accrued from these measutes. While this in a way reveals the vulnerability of the budget to circumstances beyond the country's control, it is nevertheless true that as long as transfer payments make a heavy claim on available resources, the development programmes of the government will suffer for lack of resources.",

Sharp increases occurred in the prices of essential imported items notably, rice, wheat flour, fuel, textiles and milk foods. Freight costs also increased sharply and tended to push up the price level even further. An added factor was the goverment policy of containing food subsidies by passing on cost increases to the consumer. It was largely in pursuit of this decision that the October 1st measures were taken whereby the price of flour and sugar was raised sharply.",

These deficits have occurred since 1958 on a continuing basis, except in 1965 when there was a marginal surplus.

However, as compared to the previous years, there was a substantial fall in the current account deficit from Rs. 196 million in 1972 to Rs. 161 million in 1973. Had it not been for the phenomenal increase in import prices and the adverse effects of the international currency disturbances, the deficit would have turned out to be lower.

Similarly, long term official capital also decreased from Rs. 415 million in 1972 to Rs. 335 million in 1973. With regard to the latter, the delays in finalising commodity aid agreements resulted in a decline in commodity aid by Rs. 94 million over the level in 1972. Since the flow of grants and long term capital was insufficient to finance the resource gap, the country had to rely on short term credits to a greater extent than hitherto. Short term credit thus obtained amounted to Rs. 1021 million. Repayments of short term credit were Rs. 739 million and the resultant increase in short term credit in 1973 was Rs. 282 million, as compared with a decrease of Rs. 9 million in 1972.",

The main objective was to rapidly increase the production of rice, subsidiary food crops and other domestic substitutes for imported food. The government gave greater emphasis than before to food production because of the country's continuing heavy dependence on rice imports. The sharp increase in the world market prices of imported foodstufis such as rice, flour and sugar during the year implied that in the future too, the bulk of Sri Lanka's foreign exchange earnings will have to be earmarked for food imports than for economic development.

The level of economic achievement in the last two years makes it difficult for the country to work towards the targets that have been indicated in the Plan, unless, the pace of development is speeded up considerably in 1974 and the two years the reafter. As for the year 1974, the Maha crop has probably come up to expectations. But the prospects of a better Yala crop seems to be less certain, with the present scarcity of fertilizer, agro-chemicals and other inputs and the continuing tendency for these prices to go up. High yielding varieties of paddy, which have been exten\u00adsively popularised, are dependent to a large extent on imported fertilizer and agro-chemicals, and shortages in these inputs are likely to create setbacks to production in the coming cultivation season. The tea and coconut industries which are also major productive sectors with considerable weightage in the national product, are likely to be affected in the same way. In addition, the uncertainties created in the plantation sector with the implementation of the land reform scheme are likely to aggravate the tendency for production to fall in this vital sector. The sharp increase in the prices of foodstuffs, crude oil and industrial raw materials is likely to reduce the availability of foreign exchange for the purchase of essential inputs which could make an effective contribution to increase productivity in agriculture.",

Recent difficulties such as the scarcity in world food and raw material supplies, international currency disturbances and the oil price hike, have raised the import prices of foodstuffs, raw materials and manufactured goods, which are all essential for the development effort, to very high levels. At the fame time, these inflationary pressures have weakened the purchasing power of the rupee and have resulted in the erosion of public and private real savings The Plan envisages a substantial and progressive increase in the level of savings so as to provide domestic resources for investment. In the Plan period savings were expected to increase from the pre plan level of 12*5 per cent per annum to 17 per cent. The actual level of savings in 1972 and 1973 have been about 12-8 per cent on the average, The factors that adversely affected the economy in 1973 were not anticipated in the Plan originally. Inflation and the increase in the cost of raw materials and capital goods have not only disturbed the pattern of investment and reduced the quantum of real resources but have also signified the need to re-orient the priorities and strategies in the Plan. These developments seem to indicate that it may be useful to re-examine the strategy and the priorities in the Plan according to current resource availability. A new set of investment priorities could be laid down taking into account the increasing shortages in food supplies and the need to diversify internal sources from which food can be obtained.

Although in real Gross National Product terms, the present development effort may show inadequate progress, yet, if other socio-economic indicators are used, the impact of development could be evaluated in a more balanced manner. In one area at least, in the redistribution of income, Sri Lanka's achievement stands out among other countries in the Asian region.",

In the estate sector, the distribution has been less equal, partly because wages have been relatively inflexible in the plantations as compared to the manufacturing and services sectors, and also, for a methodologi\u00adcal reason that in the 1963 survey, management level staff on the estates were hardly represented in the sample, whereas in 1973 adequate representation was given to them.

It may be preferable to have a slightly lower, rate of growth with a better distribution of income than the converse. The income distribution trends as depicted by the 1973 data are mainly the result of the deliberate policy of government in redistributing both income and wealth, through wage adjustments for workers receiving the lowest incomes, through the tax mechanism and other measures for redistributing wealth such as the present land reform scheme.",

The increase in unemployment since the Socio Economic Sutvey of 1969/70 could be attributed to the greater numbers of young persons who are now entering the work force for the first time, as a result of high birth rates in the fifties and early sixties. The number of young persons who take up public examinations have also increased progressively in the last few years, and this in itself is a rough index of those who are likely to enter the labour market sooner or later.",

A major reason for the decline in purchases has been the increase in the free market price for paddy and the increasing divergence between the guaranteed price and market price. Until November 1972, the guaranteed price for paddy was Rs. 15 per bushel and thereafter it was raised to Rs. 18 per bushel in February 1973 and to Rs. 25 in October 1973. Towards the end of 1973, there was evidence that the gap between the guaranteed price and the free matket price had widened even further, and the'guaranteed price fixed in October 1973 was far lower than the free market price. The latter seems to have taken place with the increase in the demand for off ration rice as a result of the reduction in the quantity of rice given on the ration with effect from October 1973.",

The Board does not provide all the facilities which the private trader gave the farmer such as credit, advance payments and transportation. It can however effectively replace the trader if it can purchase the paddy at the farmer's doorstep and pay him cash on the spot, thus obviating the need for the farmer to carry the paddy to the purchasing centre and often have the paddy rejected if it does not",

With the sharp upward movements in prices in 1973, the cost of vital inputs for paddy including fertilizer, agro chemicals, fuel, tractors and spares, and labour have risen markedly.

The surrounding oceans could virtually provide the country with an inexhaustible supply of high protein foods and this potential awaits to be fully exploited. In 1973 fish production has increased only by 0-9 per cent. The reason given for this poor performance was the lack of spare parts and fishing gear immobilising a large proportion of the mechanised fishing fleet. Even with the increasing investment in modern fishing equipment, imports of dried fish up to this date are now in the region of about Rs. 60 million per annum, while the wet fish catch has not increased appreciably.",

Furthermore even today the traditional methods seem to bring in the bulk of the total catch. In 1973 fish produced by the private sector was 201 million pounds, and the bulk of this was by traditional methods, while the Fisheries Corporation which uses mainly mechanised methods produced only 5-3 million pounds or 2 \u2022 1 per cent of the total catch. With population increasing at current rates, it may be increasingly difficult to provide all the food from the land. For one thing, the amount of land available for cultivation of food crops, would tend to diminish with increasing population pressure and in the context where world food supplies are expected to become increasingly critical, the country might have to look to the oceans as a major supplementary source for its requirements of food",

    "text": "Since 1965, when output reached the peak figure of 503 million pounds, tea production has continued to decline steadily; the only break in this trend occurred in 1968. In the earlier years the increase in production was achieved through a substantial rise in new investment and through technological improvements and with only a small increase in the planted area. As a result, Sri Lanka was able to sustain an increasing volume of exports and increase her share in world tea exports. Total production in 1973 was 466 million pounds; a fall of 5 million pounds or by 1 \u2022 1 per cent. Exports recovered from 419 million pounds in 1972 to 454 million pounds in 1973. In 1972, exports were however at a lower level ' compared to the figure of 443 million pounds in 1971. Although rupee receipts from tea exports have risen from Rs. 1162 million in 1972 to Rs. 1261 million in 1973, in relatively constant SDR value terms, earnings have fallen from SDR 171-4 million in 1972 to SDR 165-3 million in 1973. The latter has been due to cutrency realignments in international markets and the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee. The drought that affected the hill country in the second successive year was a factor that contributed to the decline in production. Equally important was the increase in the cost of inputs which made substantial inroads into producer margins and weakened the incentive to maintain investment.",

The severe drought in 1972 and the fall in fertilizer application contributed to produce one of the smallest coconut crops in the last two decades. Production fell very sharply from 2963 million nuts in 1972 to 1935 million nuts in 1973, or by 34-7 per cent. The use of fertilizer in the coconut industry fell sharply from 45,723 tons in 1972 to 30,539 tons in 1973. Since the bulk of the coconut properties are individual proprietorships and are not owned bv broad based public companies a large extent of coconut land has come under the land reforms. The uncertain\u00adties created by the land reform programme resulted in some element of neglect in the larger estates which normally produced the major part of export supplies. Assuming that the 1972 level of production was maintained in 1973 as well, the loss in foreign exchange at 1973 prices from the reduced level of coconut production in 1973 would be Rs. 385 million. This latter figure must be compared with the gross foreign exchange earnings in 1973 of Rs. 487 million from non traditional exports, consisting of Rs. 141 million from gems and Rs. 346 million from other exports2. In other words, the loss of foreign exchange earnings from coconut has not even been offset by the gains in foreign exchange earnings from non-traditional exports other than gems.",

Several important corporations were affected by high import prices and relative scarcities of raw materials. Some had to curtail operations on account of machinery breakdowns and labour disputes, n 1973, as in the previous years, the capacity utilisation in industrial corporations was very low. For instance, the Steel Corporation had utilised only 40 per cent of installed capacity, while Tyre, Hardware, Leather and the Milk Board had very low rates of capacity utilisation. Along with low capacity utilisation there were shortages of goods produced by some of the industrial corporations that worked well below capacity, notable examples were tyres, cement and milk.",

In part, this is reflected in a low rate of economic return on the capital invested. Some of the weaknesses in the management, structure and operations of the corporations which have been present from the inception have not yet been corrected. These include excess machine capacity, a surplus workforce, absence of forward planning, deficient management, and excessive outlays on overheads. Despite these, some corporations tend to perpetuate these deficiencies by the continued recruitment of labour when there is a surplus already in the workforce, and by ad hoc management decisions.",

For decades, Sri Lanka's export ttade had been dominated by the three primary commodities tea, rubber and coconut, which together accounted for more than 90 per cent of export earnings. This heavy commodity concentration of exports, made export earnings particularly vulnerable to adverse price trends in international markets. Policies to diversify the export structure failed to show appreciable results until 1973; In 1973, however, the earlier",

    "text": "1. Since 1949 the'first change in the exchange'rate of the Sri Lanka rupee took place in November 1967, when the rupee was devalued by 20 per-cent, following the devast\u00adation of the pound sterling by 14 percent. The resulting etfective devaluation of the rupee was some 7 per cent in terms of sterling. In May 1968, a dual exchange rate system was established with the-Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme. The official rate remained unchanged while the FEEC rate was a depreciated rate. The FEEC rate was initially fixed at 44 per cent and the resulting deprecisticn of the rupee was 31 per cent from the .official rate. The price of FEECs was increased from 44 percent to 55 per cent in Ju'y 1969 and further raised to 65 Fe t cent in Ncvember 1972. The total depreciation in the'certificate market thus amounted to 39 per cent. In November 1971 \u2022 it was decided to aband. n the par value as the basis for setting the official rupee rate and to peg the rupee to the US dollar. This action resulted in the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the SDR and an appreciation against the prund sterling. With the floating of the pound sterling in June 1972, Sri Lanka broke the link with the US dollar and the rupee was repeggei to the pound sterling at Rs 15-60 = \u00a3 1, which was the rate operative in March 1972. As a result the rupee depreciated in terms of the pound sterling and the US dollar from the November 1967 level. By the end of 1972, as a result of the depreciation of the pound sterling in exchange markets, the value of the rupee fell further Throughout 1973, the rupee \"pound sterling rate remained unchanged, but with the devaluation of the US dollar in February 1973, the value, of the rupee in terms of the dollar appreciated. The appreciation of the rupee was strengthened by the weaken ng of the US dollar. After August 1973 with the weakening of the pound sterling the value pf the rupee started to fall once again",

This was largely due to the sharp increase in gem exports through legal channels. In this respect, the year under review represents a distinct departure from tradition. On an exchange recorded basis, non-traditional exports accounted for 25-6 percent of total exports in 1973, while the share of traditional exports fell to 74-4 per cent, which is an all time low. Although the latter figure could be partly explained in terms of the exceptionally low earnings from coconut products, nonetheless, total earn\u00adings from non-traditional exports have shown definite signs of progress towards diversification.",

The incentives pro\u00advided by the Convertible Account Scheme have infused dynamism into this sector. The leakage of foreign exchange in the earlier years, was to some extent, due to the inability of exporters, businessmen and others to purchase certain imported goods and to have access to foreign exchange legally for travel and other expen\u00additure. This demand has to some extent been met through the operation of the Convertible Account Scheme and there are indications that the scheme is now being progressively broadened to extend the uses to which foreign exchange may be put. The success of this scheme is also seen in the progressivly increasing number of persons who are entitled to convertible accounts and the amount of money which is in deposit in these accounts.",

    "text": "The data given in various sections of this Report shows that consumption expenditure has gone up in 1973 and this has been only in part due to the increase in prices. In the case of some items such as wheat flour, there has been an appreciable increase in the quantity as well. As import prices have risen faster than export prices, as reflected in the terms of trade, import capacity has virtually stagnated. The latter emphasises the need for an overall strategy to reduce the share of consumption imports, whilst increasing the share of intermediate and capital goods, so as to provide the basic ingredients for development. This is all the more important, as the substitution potential between imported and domesti\u00adcally produced goods is much lower in the case of intermediate and capital goods, than in the case of consumption goods. But the emerging balance of payments situation in 1973 was pushing these prospects even further into the background because the limited resources were largely used to finance consumption imports.1",

Because the available foreign exchange resources are extremely limited, Sri Lanka is not in a position to always carry forward adequate stocks of essential foodstuffs such as rice, flour and sugar. The current policy is to buy these commodities at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet requirements in the immediate future. Purchases in the futures markets hardly take place. In a situation where commodity prices have increased sharply and continue to fluctuate erratically at high levels, the purchasing procedures now adopted could result in an actual loss of foreign exchange if the decisions taken do not always ensure that purchases are made at the lowest prices. To make the best of the prevailing price and market situations, a continuing and thorough study of international markets, prices and their probable future trends may be necessary in order to get the maximum quantum of imports from the available foreign exchange by buying at the lowest prices. It is insufficient to work on certain notional trends in international commodity prices, or to make purchases in the expectation that prices will continue to rise because they have done so before. The management of the country's foreign exchange resources requires an expert knowledge of international markets and ad hoc decisions cannot always be to the best advantage of the country. In the management of the country's foreign exchange resources, the Foreign Exchange Budget Committee could play an important role in making the right decisions.",

In the present situa\u00adtion where the available foreign exchange resources are very limited and the coun\u00adtry has to increasingly resort to short term borrowings to finance its immediate payments, mainly foodstuffs, it is incongruous to permit the balances in Sri Lanka's favour in these accounts to increase. While no interest accrues on these balances, the interest rates at which short term credits have been available in in recent times have been around 8 per cent. The amounts owing to Sri Lanka could be reduced only if endeavours are made to ensure that purchases from these countries are increased rapidly. Apart from the role that Sri Lanka's foreign missions abroad could play in this connection, the closer supervision of these accounts at home could also make a contribution. Looking at the countries that owe Sri Lanka at present, it would appear that there is scope to increase imports which are now critically in short supply. For instance, some of these countries with which Sri Lanka has credit balances could supply Sri Lanka with crude oil, especially now, when the courqry finds it difficult to get supplies on favourable terms. Certain other Asian countries that have recently entered into bilateral trading arrangements have been able to obtain crude oil on conces\u00adsionary terms.",

    "text": "A current account deficit in the balance of payments implies a shortfall in domestic savings over investment. In fact, it is only through a deficit in the current account that foreign resources are absorbed into the economy to supplement those available domestically. The gap can be covered in several ways. These include an inflow of long term private capital, the inflow of long term official capital, recourse to short term credits, the use of external assets or by increasing banking liabilities. The economic situation facing Sri Lanka dictates that long term capital inflows are the most desirable from of financing deficits. In practice, of course, trends in 1973 have not been in this direction The analysis of the capital account transactions in 1973 focusses attention on a basic weakness in the methods used to finance the current account deficit. Since 1968 heavy reliance has been placed on short and medium term credits as means of financing the external resource gap. Recurring short term indebtedness as shown in the table above has become a permanent mechanism of external financing in Sri Lanka.",
