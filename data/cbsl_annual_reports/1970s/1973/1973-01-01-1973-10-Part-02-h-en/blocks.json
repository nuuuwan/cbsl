    "text": "On provisional estimates the balance on current international transactions of Sri Lanka showed a deficit bf Rs. 161million in 1973 as compared to a deficit of Rs. 196 million in 1972. This deficit runs parallel with the declining terms of trade trend observed since 1965. But for the accelerated price increases for imports in 1972 and 1973, due largely to inflationary conditions and supply constraints abroad and to the uncertainty in the international monetary scene, the deficit for the year would have been considerably lower. Nevertheless, the 1973 outturn is a further improvement of the external accounts position since 1969. This continuing improvement has been managed by recourse to strict import policies governing both quantities and payments. It does not indicate any slackening of domestic demand. Merchandise trade, the major component of the current account of the balance of payments, was in deficit to the tune of Rs. 299 million as compar\u00aded to Rs. 255 million in 1972. However, in view of a sharply increased surplus on account of invisibles transactions, which on a net basis brought in Rs. 138 million as compared with Rs. 59 million in 1972, the current account deficit was reduced to Rs. 161 million.",

In the absence of sufficient foreign exchange reserves, long-term capital inflow is the most desirable way in which this deficit can be covered. Such inflows in 1973 were more than sufficient to offset this shortfall resulting in a surplus in the overall balance of Rs. 36 million. Despite this favourable balance, Sri Lanka's dependence on short-term finance failed to register a decline. On the contrary, indebtedness on account of short-term and suppliers' credits (net of amortization) increased by Rs. 282 million. This source of finance, however, enabled Sri Lanka to achieve a modest increase in external assets (Rs. 125 million) in addition to a reduction in external banking liabilities (Rs. 112 million).",

Although this may seem a further deteriora\u00adtion from the 1972 outturn, the annual figure conceals a marked upswing in export earnings which began in the middle of the year and continued strongly for the rest of the year. The level of imports continued to be governed principally by the need to ensure certain critical minimum levels of consumption in respect of essential foodstuffs and to prevent widespread production and employment cut\u00adbacks in manufacturing industry by making a reasonable amount of raw materials and other intermediate goods available to state and private industry. Over four-fifths of the deficit (Rs. 270 million) resulted in the first half of the year, and in contrast, the third and fourth quarters showed near balance between exports and imports.",

In the light of the sluggish export perfor\u00admance in the several preceding years, this upturn represents a distinct break with the past.

The upturn in fact appeared in the closing months of 1972 and throughout 1973 prices rose strongly to close at Rs. 2-69 per pound f. o. b. in December. Overall earnings from rubber are estimated at Rs. 519 million, compared with Rs. 299 million in the previous year. While better prices account for the larger part of the increased earnings, some part is also due to a higher volume of ship\u00adments. Coconut prices, too, rose steadily during 1973, in keeping with the upward trend for most primary product prices; but earnings from coconut products fell in 1973 on account of certain restrictions on exports. Coconut oil exports suffered considerably owing to an export ban operative from 9th April, to 1st December, 1973. In the case of copra, there was a complete export ban from 15th February onwards running through to the end of the year. This export ban was the result of a sharp decline in domestic output of coconut following the previous years' droughts so that a need arose to ensure adequate supplies for local consumption. As a result, the bulk of exports in 1973 took the form of desiccated coconut.",

    "text": "Of the minor exports, precious and semi-precious stones, coconut products other than oil, desiccated coconut and copra, other agricultural products, industrial goods and bunkers showed marked increases in earnings when compared with earlier years. Exports of precious and semi-precious stones, in particular, showed a phenomenal increase rising from Rs. 8 million in 1972 to Rs. 130 million in 1973^. The increase in earnings from gems as well as other minor exports was due to an increase in volume as well as in price. The increment in volume of exports could be attributed mainly to the very attractive incentives extended to this sector. For instance, all minor exports were entitled to the benefit of a 65 per cent domestic price enhancement by way of FEECs. In addition, gem exports were eligible for an income tax amnesty and a convertible rupee account facility of 25 per cent of their earnings. All other minor exports were allowed the convertible rupee account facility upto 2 per cent2; Industrial exports enjoyed a further facility of a rebate on duties paid on raw material imports. It should be noted, however, that the increase in earnings from minor agricultural exports was largely due to sharply rising prices during the general commodity boom.",

    "text": "A factor which needs mention as a possible influence on Rupee export values is the frequent changes in exchange parities. Normally, when an exchange rate is depreciated, the local proceeds tend to increase without the foreign currency value of export proceeds going up. During 1973, frequent parity changes of the Sri Lanka Rupee caused it to depreciate against foreign currencies by about five per cent. However, as an explanation for the higher Rupee earnings, this has been of marginal relevance in 1973 as the bulk of the increase in export earnings is reflected in foreign currency terms: in US dollars, exports have increased from 308 million in 1972 to 368 million in 1973. In effect, this confirms the importance of the international price factor as the main influence on export earnings in 1973.",

This is a sharp, reversal. of the declining trend of import values observed since the peak of 1969 following the liberalisation of imports in 1968. The increase did not imply a change in the policy of limiting imports to what the country could afford. Rather, it was the inevitable outcome of sharply increased .prices which had to be paid for Sri Lanka's essential imports. While the price increases were spread over all items, the increases in respect of essential food items like sugar, flour, rice, milk foods and subsidiary foodstuffs were exceptionally large. Prices on the one hand were considerably higher than hitherto owing to a tight world supply position, which continued throughout the year, and on the other, due to a higher freight bill occasioned by several surcharges imposed by shipping lines in the wake of currency realignments.",

With criticial minimum levels of consumption imports being a first charge on available resources, and with price escalation greater in the case of bulk food items, food imports in 1973 increased their share from 44 per cent to 52 per cent Imports of intermediate and capital goods therefore suffered reductions in their respective shares, declining from 26-9 per cent and 27.2 per cent to 24-2 per cent and 20-7 per cent, respectively.",

    "text": "The services account of Sri Lanka's balance of payments has traditionally been in deficit. The years 1965 to 1968 provide an exception but this is explained very largely by the restrictions imposed on certain classes of payments e-g- the moratorium on profits and dividends. The re-emergence of the deficit from 1969 onwards not only conforms to the previous trend but in addition was reimoreed by the backlog of payments withheld in the preceding few years. In this background, the surplus of Rs. 57 million resulting from transactions on the services account in 1973 without the need for additional restrictive measures on payments is an encouraging sign. Statistically, the total outpayments on services has remained at much the same level as could have been envisaged from the historical trends. But the receipts show a marked increase over the previous levels and it is here that the'primary source of the surplus lies. Specifically, the receipts on other transportation account (mainly port services, excluding-the supply of \"bunkers to ships arid aircrafts) and travel, evidence notable increases totalling Rs. 54 million.. Besides, smaller gains all-round have added another Rs. 51 million.",

This increase is the outcome of both an increase in the number of tourists visiting the country as well as an increase in earnings per tourist. The number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka increased from 56,047 in 1972 to 77,883 in 1973, an increase of 39 per cent. This development went hand in hand with the expansion of the infrastructural facilities set up to cater to arid attract a high volume of tourist traffic. Judged by the occupancy ratios and the rapid achievement of break-even points in the operation of tourist hotels, there seems to be scope for the provision of higher capacity to accommodate growing demand. However, an element of uncertainty has been introduced into international tourism by the impact of the energy crisis on air-line traffic.",

In 1969 and 1970, its role was reversed and larger deficits than were indicated by merchandise transactions occurred, largely owing to increased outflows on account of investment income, due partly to relaxation of the moratorium and partly to increased service payments on the rising external debt. Since 1971, however, the invisibles account assumed its former role of modifying the adverse effects of the trade balance. The year",

    "text": "In the current context of the external accounts situation facing Sri Lanka, long-term capital is the most appropriate from of finance to bridge the resource gap. Private long-term capital has not been a significant source of finance in recent years. The inflow of long-term official capital which fell from the peak figure of Rs. 494 million in 1971 to Rs. 415 million in 1972, suffered a further setback in 1973, declining to Rs. 335 million. When allowance is made for repayments on past borrowings amounting to Rs. 141 million, the net inflow declined to Rs. 194 million. The reduction is wholly reflected in commodity aid, which fell by as much as Rs. 94 million over the level obtained in 1972. One important reason for this drop had been certain delays in the signing of aid agreements in 1973. Although the Aid Group meeting was held in March, 1973 the bulk of the agreements was signed only towards the end of the year. This meant that actual disbursements started quite late. It is also partly explained by the cut-back in aid commitments in the previous year (1972)1 which resulted in the spillover for 1973 being reduced.",

On the basis of import licences issued by the Controller of Imports and Exports for the period 1.3. 1973 to 31-12-1973, it is observed that the bulk of the import pay\u00adments has been for industrial raw materials and trade quota items; payments for the former amounted to Rs. 5-7 million and for the latter Rs. 8-7 million. Convertible rupees utilised for the importation of motor vehicles amounted to Rs. 3-5 million or 17 per cent of the import licences issued.
