1. P R I C E S

The major indicator of price changes in Sri Lanka is the Colombo Consumers* Price Index, but its usefulness as a reliable index has been vitiated by its well known short-comings which have been spotlighted in previous Annual Reports1.

The annual average of the consumer prices, according to the Colombo Consumers* Price Index, increased by 9.7 per cent in 1973, as compared to an increase of 6.3 per cent in 1972. The increase in 1973 was mainly in the months of January, June, August and October when the index rose by 2.3, 2.9, 1.8 and 2.7 per cent respectively; during the rest of 1973, the index on the average rose by 0.5 per cent, per month.

The sharp price increases in 1973 were largely due to increased prices of important consumer items such as rice, wheat flour, fuel, textiles, milk foods, condiments, coconuts and eggs. Prices of many essential imported items increased sharply due to scarcities in world markets. Inflationary tendencies the world over and the increases in freight rates continued to exert pressure on prices in

1973. The international energy crisis added considerable momentum in pushing up prices locally. These factors had a pervasive effect on prices of most commodities. Adverse weather conditions that prevailed in 1973, too, resulted in a fall in local production creating scarcities and thus pushing up prices.

The coverage of the Business Turnover Tax was extended from 1st November, 1973 and certain articles which had hitherto been exempted were brought within the scope of the tax. The increase in the price of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates and the broadening of the scope of Business Turnover Tax in late 1972 had their full impact in 1973. The sharp increases in the money supply particularly in June, July and August 1973 may have also contributed towards the situation.

1. The main drawbacks of the Colombo Consumers' Price Index are: -

(a) The inadequacy of the index to measure the changes in the general level of prices as it is designed to measure changes in the cost of living of an average working class family in Colombo town only.

(b) The weights have not been revised since 1952 despite substantial changes in the pattern of consumption of the working class. (c) Value weights of the index have been adjusted from time to time to take account of the non-availability of certain items or a possible reduction of the quantity consumed as a result of an unexpected change in the consumption pattern. This type of adjustment introduces an aribitrary element in to the index.

(d) The inadequate attention paid to the relative importance of prices prevailing in open and controlled markets arising mainly from fluctuations in the supply of commodities caused by shortages.

( 202 )

There were significant changes in the rationing scheme for rice, wheat flour, sugar, maldivefish and dhal in 1973. For the first time, wheat flour was issued on ration from 1st October, 1973. Existing price conttols on many essential items were continued but with upward revision of prices to take account of higher import costs or rise in production costs. The main items in this category were certain milk foods, mammoties ( Lankaloha), some varieties of formic acid, asbestos sheets, umbrellas and cement. However, price controls on a few items such as satin materials and soap were removed whilst some varieties of infant milkfoods, one variety of formic acid and shirts made of synthetic materials were brought under price control during 1973.

(a) Colombo Consumers' Price Index

As mentioned earlier, the Colombo Consumers' Price Index rose by 9.7 per cent in 1973 as compared to an increase of 6.3 per cent in 1972. The sub-indices for clothing increased by 14.0 per cent, fuel and light by 12.7 per cent, food by 11.7 per cent and miscellaneous items by 0.3 per cent. The corresponding increases for 1972 were 12.8 per cent, 3.6 per cent, 6.0 per cent and 6. 2 per cent, respectively.

The sub-index for the food group which has the highest weightage

( 61-9 per cent) in the overall index rose sharply during the months of January, June, and October by 2.7, 4-7 and 4-0 per cent, respectively. During the rest

of 1973, the average monthly increase in the index for food was 0-8 per cent.

( 203 )

This substantial increase in the sub-index was mainly due to the increases in the cost of imported food items such as wheat flour, sugar, butter, spices, pulses and other condiments. In 1973, the free ration of rice was reduced from one measure to a half and the price of the second measure on ration was increased from Rs. 1.00 to Rs. 1.60 and was finally reduced to Rs. 1.40. Wheat flour was rationed for the first time in 1973 and its price was raised from 33 cts. per lb. to 70 cts. in three steps. In parallel with these; changes the price of bread rose from 34 cts. to 76 cts. per lb. and only a limited quantity was available. The other major commodity that experienced price increases is sugar. The sugar issued on the ration was reduced from 2 lbs. per person per month to 3/4 lb. at the former price of 72 cts. per lb. Off ration sugar formerly priced at Rs. 1.50 per lb. was raised to Rs. 2.00. There was also a steep,rise in the prices of coconuts and coconut oil as a result of a fall in local production. The prices of fresh milk and condensed milk were raised with effect from 26th May, 1973. Also, owing to the high cost of poultry food, the price of eggs increased sharply. Marked price increases were also recorded in food items such as tea, coffee, salt, lime, jam and biscuits.

Following the trend in 1972, the sub-index for clothing in 1973 recorded the largest percentage increase among sub-group indices. The 1973 increase was 14-0 per cent, as against an increase of 12.8 per cent in 1972.

The sub-index for fuel and light recorded an increase of 12.7 percent during 1973 as compared to an increase of 3• 6 per cent in 1972. A, good part of this was due to the upward revisions in the prices of kerosene oil on 31st December, 1972 and 24 th August, 1973; and there was a rise in the price of firewood in August, 1973.

In 1973, the sub-index for rent remained unchanged.

The increase in the sub-index for the miscellaneous group in 1973 Was only 0-3 per cent, when compared with the increase for 1972 of 6-2 per cent. A downward revision in the excise on tobacco helped to partly offset the average annual increase in the sub-index. On account of the rise in the price of coconut oil, the controlled price of soap was revised upward by about 20 per cent in March, 1973. Again, for the same reason, the price of soap was decontrolled with effect from 1st October, 1973 causing further increase in prices of^about 9 per cent in October and 8 per cent in November.

(b) Prices not covered by the Colombo Consumers'Price Index In additon to the prices of items covered by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index, the'Central Bank has regularly collected the prices of a limited1 number of other items'. These were obtained by direct inquiry from the retailers in the city ' of Colombo. Published trade price lists too, were scrutinised for this purpose.

For detailed analysis these items are broadly classified as consumer, intermediate and investment goods. Percentage changes in the prices of selected items from end of year 1972 to that of 1973 are shown by the table II (1)2. These figures may be treated as rough indicators of the extent of price movements in each class of goods. ' < .•

Consumer goods

The annual average increase in the open market price of par bolied rice in

Colombo for the year 1973 fluctuated between 50 and 55 per cent. The average

price of rice for the first three quarters of 1973 increased by 18 per cent in

comparison with the corresponding period of 1972. During the last quarter of

1973, however, the average price of rice, on a similar comparison increased by about

155 per cent. This price increase was largely due to the increased demand for

open market rice induced by the reduction in the rice ration and the rationing

of wheat flour.

( 205 )

The main reasons for the increase in the prices of other consumer goods were increased cost of imported raw materials, higher freight rates and increased wages. Further, the enhanced price of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates and the increase in the Business Turnover Tax which carr e into effect in the latter part

of 1972 would have had their full impact in 1973.

Intermediate goods

The increase in the price of paper was partly due to the increase in price

of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates. There was also a world-wide scarcity

of paper during 1973 resulting in a sharp escalation of prices. Higher production costs were the main reason for the increases in prices of locally manufactured intermediate goods. The price of super petrol was raised from Rs. 5.75 to Rs. 6.50 per gallon whilst, that of ordinary petrol was raised from Rs. 5.30 to Rs. 6.10 per gallon with effect from 24th August, 1973. Rising costs of imported crude oil and freight rate increases were the main causes for this upward revision.

Investment goods

During the course of 1973, there was a substantial increase in prices of many

of the finished products of the Ceylon Steel Corporation. The price of imported mammoties was decontrolled in 1973, in order to provide an incentive to local production. Prices of a good number of investment goods increased owing to the increased costs of raw materials and to the increased costs of production.

(c) Wholesale prices of locally manufactured commodities

There was a satisfactory responsejfrom manufacturers to the Central Bank's inquiries regarding movements of wholesale prices of locally manufactured com­modities during 1973. Price movements for few of the representative items covered

by the study are given in table II (I) 3. These prices do not contain margins charged by bulk distributors at various points of the distributive trade, but refer to those quoted by the manufacturers themselves or their sole agents.

Except in the case of drugs, tobacco and some items of textiles the whole­sale prices showed considerable increases. Price increases were mainly due to increase in the cost of imported raw materials, increase in Business Turnover Tax and increased wages.

The decrease in the wholesale prices of cigarettes and tobacco was due to the reduction in the excise on tobacco. Further, as a result of the reduction

of Business Turnover Tax and the introduction of price controls on synthetic textiles in 1973 some of these wholesale prices decreased. During the year the price controls kept static the wholesale prices of a variety of drugs in great, demand.

2. WAGES

The Central Bank's wage rate indices for technical and clerical employees, minor employees and school teachers in the government sector are based on the minimum salaries and wages and allowances payable in represen­tatives scales. Overtime and incremental payments, are therefore not included. Wage rate indices for workers in agriculture and industry and commerce covered by wages boards in the private sector are published by the Labour Department. These indices are based on minimum wage rates fixed by wages boards and from December, 1967 include "devaluation allowances." /

It should be noted that the wage rate indices referred to do not represent actual earnings which would include overtime, and in the private sector, incentive or special payments such as bonuses. Indices of real wage rates are calculated by the Central Bank by deflating the wage rate indices by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index.

Source: Central Bank of Ceylon. (a) Combined index for clerical and technical employees, and minor employees.

Note The index numbers are calculated on fixed weights, based on the numbers employed as at 30th September, 1959. The wage rate used in the calculations of index numbers are the initial salaries and wages and allowances in each representative scale.

Table II ( I ) 4 shows the annual and quarterly indices of wage rates and real wage rates of government employees for 1972 and 1973.

The annual average indices of wage rates of all categories of government employees were higher in 1973 than the average for 1972. The indices of wage rates of technical and clerical employees, minor employees and school teachers rose by 3. 6 per cent, 5. 9 per cent and 2-2 per cent respectively.

( 209 )

After a period of about three years there was a rise in wage rates of government employees in December 1972 owing to the payment of a "special allowance" to monthly paid employees drawing less than Rs. 250 a month in accordance with the Budget proposals. Again, in the last quarter of 1973 the wage rate index for government employees increased further with the payment with effect from 1st October, 1973, of a "special allowance" of 10 per cent of salary, but not exceeding Rs. 20, to all government employees drawing less than Rs. 400 a month.

However, the real wages of the government employees in 1973 showed a decline. The indices for clerical employees, minor employees, and government school teachers declined by 5.6 per cent, 3.4 per cent, and 6.7 per cent respectively.

The following table shows the annual and quarterly indices of minimum wage rates for workers covered by certain wages boards in the private sector for 1972 and 1973.
