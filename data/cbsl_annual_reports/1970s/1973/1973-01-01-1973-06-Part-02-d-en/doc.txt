The data published inthis section and in the tables have been provided, by the respective enterprises. The data furnished in the report are not final and are liable to revision when audited figures become available.

Several corporations have had delays in finalising their accounts for 1973 and in these cases only provisional and estimated data have been used in the tables. Consequently, the usefulness of statements on the overall performance of the corporation sector is limited.

The total number of enterprises as at end of 1973 was 84 ,v of which 10f were established during the year. Of these, two of them, namely the State Distilleries Corporation, and the National Water Supply St Drainage Board were set up to take over the work previously undertaken by two government departments.

Total investment of the public enterprises rose from Rs. 5,123 million in 1972 to Rs. 5,624 million in 1973 or by 9-7 per cent. Table 11 (D) 1 shows the distribution of investment between broad categories of activities in the public sector. Of the new investment in this sector in 1973, nearly 43 per cent was in industty and 41 per cent in service enterprises.

Employment in all enterprises increased from 191,103 in 1972 to 195,822+ in 1973. Capital per employee in 1973 in the state industrial sector was Rs. 6,046+ while in the services sector it was Rs. 7,072 +

In 1973, 25 corporations including banks and other financial institutions of the public sector have shown profits.1 Of these, sixteen corporations made larger profits2, eight have made less profits3 while one made a profit as agains a loss in the previous year.4 Ten enterprises incurred losses in 1973, of these, four have incurred bigger losses,5 two have reduced their loss6 and four have incurred losses as against a profit7 in the previous year. In 1973, contribution to the Consolidated Fund by public enterprises was Rs. 39'4 million as against Rs. 59.9 million in 1972.1

Table 11 (D) 2 gives the summary of the performance of industrial corpora­tions for the year 1973. In 1973, there were 26 industrial corporations including Fisheries, but one of them, the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation, had not commenced production. The total capital investment in these 26 corpo­rations increased from Rs. 2,253 million in 1972 to Rs. 2,414 million in 1973, or by 7 per cent. The capital employed in production was Rs. 1,620 million or 69 per cent of the invested capital.tt

The value of output (at current prices) of industrial corporations increased from Rs. 947-5 million in 1972 to Rs. 1,074-1 million in 1973 or by 13-4 per cent. This increase in value of output was mainly the result of increases in the prices of inputs. The rate of growth of the state industrial sector at constant prices was negative in 1973. Industrial production at constant prices declined by 2-1 per cent in 1973 as against an increase of 23 per cent in 1972. The output index below gives the change in industrial production in real terms over the last five years.

However, despite the decline in the growth of this sector some industries in the public sector showed an increase in production in 1973. Noteworthy increases took place in Ceramics, Textiles, and Paper. A number of other major industries in the state sector namley, Steel, Tyre, Milk and Flour Milling, showed substantial declines in output.

Capacity utilisation was low in a large number of public industrial enter­prises. For example, the Steel Corporation worked only 40 per cent of its installed capacity. Other corporations which worked well below capacity were Tyre, Hardware, Leather, and the Milk Board. Among the major factors contributing to the low utilisation of capacity were the lack of continuity in supplies

of certain raw materials, absenteeism and the breakdown of machinery. Apart from this, a great number of corporations had built-in weaknesses from the inception, such as, over capitalisation, excess machine capacity, surplus work­force, absence of forward planing, deficient managerial know-how, and limited markets.

The sales turnover of industrial corporations increased from Rs. 1,319 million in 1972 to Rs. 1,695 million in 1973 or by 28 per cent. This excludes the value of sales arising from purely trading activities, i.e. sale of imported finished goods. Increase in receipts from sales was not due to an increase in production but largely due to the upward revision of prices in the course of 1973 Of the reporting corporations, 15 have increased the prices of their products substantially. The prices of certain products that have had an appreciable price increase are given below.

Industrial corprations have contributed Rs. 7-8 million to the Consolidated Fund in 1973 as against Rs. 35-8 million in 1972.

The total foreign exchange earnings of industrial corporations resulting from exports increased from Rs. 114 • 1 million in 1972 to Rs. 167-1 million in

1973. Of this, the Petroleum Corporation accounted for Rs. 134-4 million, Graphite Corporation Rs. 11-8 million, Mineral Sands Corporation Rs. 6 million Oils and Fats Corporation Rs. 4*8 million, and State Flour Milling Corporation

Rs. 3 -1 million.

The average rate of return before tax oh capital employed in production was 2-6 per cent as againt 9-2 per cent in 1972, while the return on investment was 1 • 79 per cent in 1973 as against 4-8 per cent in 1972. The highest return on capital employed was shown by the Ceramics Corporation which recorded

16-5 percent, while State Flour Milling & Tyre Corporation recorded a return

of less than 5* per cent. The total wage bill and the number employed in the industrial corporations cannot be estimated as all corporations have not reported their figures.

3. I N D U S T R I E S I N T H E P U B L I C S E C T O R

A. Food, Beverages and Tobacco

(a) Milk Board

In 1973, there was a general decrease in the production and sale of all products of the processing division, with the exception of butter. This situation could be mainly attributed to the fall in demand following the mid-year increase in prices of all milk products. The excess milk purchases were diverted to the condensed milk factory and the powdered milk factory, increasing their production marginally. Overall, the turn-over of the Board increased by 17 per cent, primarily on account of the price increase.

The Milk Board's prices have remained unchanged since 1968 until the price revision of 1973. Prices paid for raw milk too were kept constant since 1967, despite an increase in cost of production. This was an important contributory factor in dampening milk production in the country, which was evident from the reduction in the Board's purchases towards end of 1972. The policy of the Board up to 1973 was to keep consumer prices low and the position was partly rectified in 1973 when the purchase price was raised to a maximum of 65 cents per pint.

In 1973, the Milk Board sustained a loss of Rs. 35 million. This substan­tial increase in the loss was due to the higher prices paid for raw milk, the inclusion of milk imports under FEECs, and the rise in prices of imported inputs used in manufacture.

(b) Oils and Fats Corporation

With the exception of oils, the output of the Corporation declined in 1973. The output of provender was 52,000 tons. This represented the utilisation of only 56 per cent of installed capacity. One reason for the low utilisation of capacity was the reduced purchases of imported raw materials on account of higher world prices. The lower production in 1973 created an acute shortage of poultry feeds in the country.

Receipts from sales, however, increased by Rs. 7 million owing to an upward revision of prices in February 1973. The price increase was induced by the imposition of FEECs on imported raw materials and a general increase in the cost of all raw materials used in production. The Corporation sustained a loss in its operations even after the price increase, because this increase in prices was inadequate to offset the increase in costs.

(c) Sugar Corporation

Data relating to 1973 were not made available by this Corporation. This is the third year in succession where the corporation has been unable to furnish any information on its operations for the year under review. In view of the unprecedented increase in the world prices of sugar, a dose review of the opera­tions of this Corporation is necessary in order to ascertain the overall economics of large scale sugar production in Sri Lanka.

( 89 )

(d) State Flour Milling Corporation

In the year under review, the output of flour fell by nearly 5,000 tons compared to an increase of 10,000 tons in 1972. This decrease was attributed to a shortfall in the supplies of imported grain and breakdowns in machinery. There was a corresponding drop in the production of by-products such as bran and pollard. However, with a view to meeting the increase in domestic demand for its products after the reduction in rice and flour rations, the Corporation has increased the production of one of its by-products, i. e., Atta flour. Despite the drop in production in 1973, the Flour Mill's capacity utilisation was a high 95 • 5 per cent. In this respect the Flour Milling Corporation is one of the few corporations that has had a capacity utilisation of oyer 95 per cent.

Despite a general increase in prices, the profits of the Corporation in 1973 fell by Rs. 0-6 million to Rs. 3-0 million. This was largely due to the increase in the prices of imported wheat grain. The foreign exchange earnings from bran and pollard too showed a decrease of Rs. 1-0 million to Rs. 3 • 2 million as compared to 1972. Despite a high'capacity-utilisation, the return on capital employed was only 3-7 per cent. One reason for the low rate of return is that the Corporation had to maintion the price of the finished product comparatively low, despite the higher prices paid for wheat grain. Its contribution to the Consolidated Fund in 1973 was Rs. 5 million.

(e) National Salt Corporation

The production of salt declined by 34,000 tons to 121,000 tons or by 22 per cent in 1973. This production, however, exceeded the domestic demand of •90,000 tons per annum and as a result the Corporation had a substantial stock of salt at the end of the year. Receipts from sales increased from Rs. 8-96 million in 1972 to Rs. 13-33 million or by 48 per cent in 1973, largely owing to the increase in the selling price of salt from Rs. 100 to Rs. 167 per ton in May 1973.

On a higher turnover, the Corporation made a profit (before tax) of Rs. 2-1 million as against Rs. 1-3 million in the previous year. The return on capital employed in production was 8-4 per cent as compared to 6 • 2 percent in 1972. This figure is still too low for an industry with a low rate of capital utilization and accordingly there is room for the rationalisation of production costs.

B . Textiles - Wearing Apparel and Leather Industries

(a) National Textile Corporation

As compared to 1972, production at the Thulhiriya Mill increased in 1973-The highest increase was in the production of yarn amounting to 7 • 3 million yards while there were marginal increases in other products. The Mill has consumed imported raw materials worth Rs. 39-4 million during the year. Prices of the products of this mill were revised as a result of the imposition of FEECs on cotton yarn. Employment at this Mill in 1973 was 3,722 and the wage bill was Rs. 3-0 million. The loss for 1973 is estimated at Rs. 3-5 million.

( 90 )

Production at the Veyangoda Mill too, showed an increase. The higher sales turnover was partly due to the revision of prices. The estimated profit for the year was Rs. 10-1 million compared to a profit of Rs. 2-6 million in the previous year. Total employment at the Veyangoda Mill was 2,380.

The Textile Mill at Pugoda was commissioned in 1973 and during the year total production amounted to 9,000 lbs. of yarn and 51,000 yards of grey cloth. Financial results for the year have not yet been estimated. The Mill provided employment for 798 persons.

(b) Ceylon Leather Products Corporation

In the year under review, the output of shoes and bark leather declined, while the production of chrome leather and leather goods increased slightly. In 1973, the shoe factory worked at 60 per cent of capacity and was only able to meet the domestic demand of shoes by drawing down previous stocks. The Corporation recommenced its export business and from its exports of shoes, chrome, and leather goods, earned Rs. 2-0 million in foreign exchange.

Earnings from sales increased by 10 per cent in 1973 largely on account of the increases in the prices of shoes and leather. Profit for the year was estimated at Rs. 0-68 million.

C. Wood and Wood Products

(a) Ceylon Plywoods Corporation

Data for 1973 were not made available.*

(b) State Timber Corporation

The State Timber Corporation undertakes the sawing and sale of timber and the extraction of timber by mechanised units.

During the year, production and sales were higher than in the previous year. Despite the higher turnover, this Corporation sustained a loss of Rs. 2 • 4 million in 1973 as against a profit of Rs. 0-2 million in 1972. The Corporation exported 1,856 cu. ft. of logs in 1972, but there were no exports in 1973.

D. Paper and Paper Products, Printing and Publishing

(a) Eastern Paper Mills Corporation With the commissioning of the new paper board mill at Valaichchenai, the Corporation now has the capacity to manufacture 22,500 tons of paper and paper board. In 1973, the actual production of paper and paper board was 19,337 tons representing 86 per cent utilisation of capacity, which is an increase of 25 per cent over the previous year. According to provisional figures, the profits of the Corporation declined in 1973 owing to the increase in import prices and a higher wage bill. Financial accounts for 1973 have not yet been finalised.

* This Corporation did not have basic details of production and sales for 1973. The corpo­ration is the principle supplier of tea chest panels to the tea industry. In view of the progressive increase in the price of tea chest panels a review of the activities of this corporation Is of special significance.

( 91 )

(b) State Printing Corporation

The State Printing Corporation commenced production towards the end of 1970. The value of output in 1972 was Rs. 3-4 million as against Rs. 1-9 million in 1971. Data relating to 1973 have not been made available.

E. Chemical, Petroleum, Rubber and Plastic Products

(a) Paranthan Chemicals Corporation

Two major products of the Corporation, namely caustic soda and liquid chlorine recorded an increase in 1973 while other products showed a decline over the previous year. Meanwhile, corresponding increases in sales were shown in caustic soda and liquid chlorine.

Corporations profit (befor tax) is estimated at Rs. 0-7 million as against Rs. 0-4 million in the previous year.

(b) Ceylon Tyre Corporation

In 1973, the production of both truck and car tyres suffered a set-back due to the breakdown of machinery, causing acute shortages in the local market. The production of 'agricultural' tyres, however, increased due to the increase in the demand for these tyres on account of the food drive.

This Corporation has an installed capacity to produce 250,000 tyres and 250,000 tubes a year. Since commercial production commenced in 1967, capacity utilization has been rather erratic. In the case of tyres, capacity utilization in the first year was 23 per cent; it gradually rose up to 28 per cent in 1969/70, and reached a sudden peak of 63 per cent in 1971. Thereafter, production has fallen gradually to 60 per cent in 1973. In the case of tubes, fluctuation was more pronounced. From an initial production of 40 per cent of capacity in the first year, it dropped to 25 per cent in 1960/70, reached a peak of 85 per cent in 1970/71 and thereafter has dropped sharply to a low utilisation rate of 33 per cent in 1973. The Corporation has given three main reasons for the inability to utilise installed capacity, namely, the shortage of moulds for the manufacture of tyres, the breakdown of machinery (especially the major breakdown in October) and the shortage of imported raw materials for the production of tyres and tubes. The Corporation has an installed capacity far in excess of the requirements of the local market. Thus, if production is increased to maximum capacity, export markets will have to be found for a major part of its products.

The total value of sales, however, declined in spite of the increase in sales of 'agricultural' tyres. The Corporation also exported tyres, tubes and flaps during the year and earned Rs. 0-4 million in foreign exchange. This together with the low utilization of capacity, contributed to an acute shortage of tyres in the market. This was especially felt by the Corporation's main customer namely the Ceylon Transport Board which had to import tyres to meet its requirements. In December the Corporation revised the prices of all its products as a result of the increase in the prices of imported raw material which constitute about 75 per cent of the value of material used in manufacture.

( 92 )

Profits (before tax) in 1973 was Rs 4-4 million as against Rs. 9-9 million in the previous year.

(c) Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Oil Refinery

In 1973, the overall volume of production at the Oil Refinery remained at the previous yeat's level. While the production of super petrol declined substantially over the previous year, the output of chemical naptha increased from 107,000 tons in 1972 to 128,000 tons in 1973. Value of output, increased by Rs. 31-5 million or by 12-8 per cent on account of higher cost of imported crude oil. The average c. i. f. price of crude oil increased from Rs. 91 per ton in 1972 to Rs. 146 per ton in 1973 or by 60 per cent. In 1973, the Corporation earned Rs. 134-4 million in foreign exchange by exporting the products of the Refinery.

In 1973, the Refinery made an estimated loss of Rs. 54-9 million as against a profit of Rs. 33 • 1 million in 1972. This large fall in earnings by Rs. 88 million is attributed by the Refinery to the internal pricing system. For purposes of calculating profits, some products are priced at the old import price which prevailed at the time when these identical products were imported, and others, at prices prevailing in the early part of 1973, prior to the general increase in the prices of these finished products. For purposes of general accountability, this system of pricing is unsatisfactory. The Corporation should endeavour to calculate its earnings on real prices prevailing at the time, rather than on hypotheti­cal prices which are irrelevant and out of date.

Lubrication Oil Blending Plant

At this plant, base oils and additives are blended into various grades of lubricants. In 1973, output has recorded an increase over the previous year. Sales too, have shown an increase. The profit for the year is estimated to be Rs. 2-6 million.

(d) Ceylon Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation

The Corporation produces about 150-200 different kinds of drugs and medicines. In 1973, the capital employed by the Corporation in production was Rs. 5-4 million. The value of output wasRs. 3-7 million in 1973 compared to Rs. 3-2 million in the previous year. The accounts for the year under review have not yet been finalised.

(e) State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation

This Corporation, was originally established in 1966 to set up a fertilizer factory. No data were available as it has not commenced production.

F. Non-metallic Mineral Products (except Petroleum Products)

(a) Ceylon Ceramics Corporation

With the exception of kaolin, the output of this corporation declined in 1973 as compared to the previous year. However, the crockery section at the Negombo Factory and the crockery and sanitaryware sections at the Piliyandala Factory

( 93 )

worked at maximum capacity. Slight increases were recorded in both" value of production and sales revenue. In 1973 the Corporation made an enhanced profit of Rs. 7>0 million largely on account of an upward price reivsion made during the year. This represents a 16 • 5 per cent return on capital employed. The Corporation made a contribution of Rs. 1.5 million to the Consolidated Fund in 1973.

(b) Ceylon Cement Corporation

The total output of cement showed an increase from 377,000 tons in 1972 to 415,000 tons in 1973. The cost of production per ton of cement ranged from Rs. 240 at the Kankesanturai Factory to Rs. 260 at the terminal grinding plant at Galle. Average capacity utilization was low in 1973, and this was primarily due to a shortfall in production at the Puttalam Factory caused by unfavourable weather conditions towards the end of the year. At Puttalam, the extraction of lime and clay had to be suspended due to the inundation of the pits, from which these raw materials were obtained.

The profit for 1973 is estimated at Rs. 15 million as against Rs. 17-9 million in previous year.

(c) National Small Industries Corporation

The Corporation went into liquidation with effect from October 1st, 1972. It was established in 1958 with a view to integrating and managing a series of small industries; some of these industries were totally unrelated to each other. The three major activities of the Corporation were the establishment of carpentry workshops, brick and tile factories and an ayurvedic drugs factory. From its inception the viability of this corporation was in doubt and until its liquidation, it was not able to show a profit for any one year. The average net loss for each year of its operation was around Rs. 1 million, while the total net loss for the whole period has been over Rs 15 million. In 1969, it handed over the unprofit­able drug making complex to a new Corporation, but despite this, it failed to become economically viable in respect of its two major activities, i. e. the brick and tile factories and the carpentry workshops. On liquidation, the brick and tile factories were handed over to the Ceramics Corporation on 1st October, 1972 and the carpentry workshops, to the Plywood Corporation on 1st November, 1972.

(d) Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation

In 1973 the Corporation showed a large increase in the production of Ilmenite; production increased by 13 per cent over the previous year. The output of rutile showed only a slight increase, while there was ho production of refined zircon. The reasons given are the inferior quality of mineral sands used in the production of rutile, and the lack of water for the production of zircon. Despite the decline in exports of rutile and ilmenite, the Corporation's export earnings increased by Rs. 1 million or by 10 per cent in 1973, as a result of the higher prices fetched by ilmenite. Export earnings would have been much higher if not for the fall in demand in the world market which resulted in a reduction in price of rutile from £ 60 in 1972 to £ 50 per ton in 1973.

( 94 )

The Corporation made a profit (before tax) of Rs. 3.7 million in 1973 ;as compared to a profit of Rs. 3 • 1 million in the previous year. The . return on capital employed was 13 • 8 per cent.

(ej State Graphite Corporation

Two major graphite mines, namely Kolongaha and Kahatagaha, came under the management of this Corporation, in addition to the Bogala mines.

The output increased from 7,028 tons in 1972 to 7,679 tons in 1973. The foreign exchange earned rose by 21 per cent to reach Rs. 11.8 million in 1973. Profit before tax is estimated at Rs. 5.7 million in 1973.

G. Basic Metal Industries

(a) Ceylon Steel Corporation

In 1973, the output of rolled steel and wire products declined by 26 per cent and 37 per cent respectively, while sales too showed a corresponding decline. As a result, capacity utilization has decreased further during the year to 30 per cent and 39 per cent for rolled steel and wire products, respectively.

In 1973, a steel foundry for the manufacture of carbon and alloy steel was commissioned with a rated output of 75 tons, and the production during the first year of operation was 44 tons.

The Corporation earned Rs. 3.2 million (inclusive of FEECs) from exports in 1973. On a higher turnover, the Corporation made an enhanced profit (estimated) of Rs. 12.5 million. This was principally the result of price increases following a price rise of imported raw materials.

H. Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Equipment

(a) State Hardware Corporation

There was an overall increase in production at the factory at Yakkala while the production at the Cast Iron factory declined slightly. Value of output in 1973 increased substantially. There was an increase in sales of mammoties and other agricultural equipment. The Corporation exported 500 tons of cast iron products and earned Rs. 0 • 24 million in foreign exchange.

Inspite of an increase in price of most of its products, the Corporation is expected to make a loss of Rs. 3-1 million in 1973, due largely to an increase in the cost of production.

4 . OTHER PUBLIC ENTERPRISES

A. Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing

(a) Ceylon Fisheries Corporation.

Relevant data for 1973 were not made available

(b) State Plantations Corporation

In relation to the previous year, the performance of the State Plantations Corporation improved in 1973. During the year, the Corporation managed 29 plan­tations and four factories. The revenue from the operation of plantations increased from Rs. 22.8 million in 1972 to Rs. 28.3 million in 1973. The Corporation

( 95 )

increased its profits from the plantations while it made a marginal profit from the 4 factories which incurred losses in the previous year. Taken together (plantations and factories) the total profits of the Corporation is estimated at Rs. 2.4 million compared to Rs. 1.3 million for the 15 month period ending December 1972.

The Land Reform Commission has adopted a policy of handing over the more productive estates coming under the land reforms to this Corporation. With this added responsibility, a substantial increase in the scope and activities of this Corporation can be anticipated.

B . Transport, Storage and Communication

(a) Ceylon Transport Board Certain salient aspects of the operations of the Ceylon Transport Board in the last five financial years are shown in Table II (D) 12.

With an additional investment of about Rs. 37 million, the Board's vehicle fleet increased from 6,300 in 1972 to 6,637 in 1973. However, the available effective fleet declined during the year due to frequent breakdown of vehicles; this resulted in widening of the gap between the available effective fleet and the number of vehicles required to provide a satisfactory service.

( 96 )

According to the estimates provided by the Board, the operated mileage decreased by nearly 20 million miles while the lost mileage caused by breakdowns and non-availability of crews at required times increased from 50 million miles in 1972 to 68 million miles in 1973. Meanwhile, dead mileage due to empty travel of buses from garages to standing points etc., recorded a marginal fall. The total number of passengers carried, which had been increasing over the years rose to 1,413 million in 1973. The average vehicle utilisation is estimated to be 171 miles per day.

The greater increase in expenditure offset the increase in revenue and resulted in the Board operating at a loss of Rs. 12 million in 1973 compared with Rs. 10 million in the previous year.

The number of employees remained almost static and the total workforce was 52,848 in 1973. On an average, the number of employees per bus was 8 in 1973, while managerial and technical staff works out to 5 persons per bus.

(b) Port (Cargo) Corporation

Certain salient aspects of the operations of the Corporation in the last five financial years are shown in Table II (D) 12.

The total cargo handled by the Corporation continued to decline in the year under review. This was caused by a fall in the cargo handled at the ports of Colombo and Trincomalee, arising mainly from import restrictions.

Both revenue and expendititure of the Corporation declined in 1973. As a result, the loss is estsmated at Rs. 5 • 1 million which is slightly higher than that in the preceding year.

(c) Port Tally and Protective Services Corporation

In 1973, total expenditure increased by Rs. 0-3 million while the total income from services rendered declined by Rs. 0-6 million. The Corporation incurred a loss of Rs. 1 • 2 million (before Tax).

C. Wholesale and Retail Trade

(a) Co-operative Wholesale Establishment

Certain basic statistics relating to the C.W.E. for the five years ending 1973 are given in Table II (D) 13. The Trading activities of the C.W.E. has shown a general decline in 1973. Receipts from sales fell from Rs. 369 million in 1972 to Rs. 320 million in 1973 on account of reduced supplies of goods caused by the curtailment of imports. Imports fell substantially from Rs. 172 million in 1972 to Rs. 99 million in 1973. Employment and the wage bill increased slightly. The net profits before tax fell sharply from Rs. 51 million in 1972 to Rs. 12 milllion in 1973. The value of sales per person employed in 1973 was Rs. 59,000 as against Rs. 68,000 in 1972.

The Budget for 1974 does not indicate a significant improvemement in peiformance from that of 1973.

(b) Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

In the year under review there was a fall in the volume of crude oil imports. However, in view of the increase in import prices, the cost of products sold increased from Rs. 356 million in 1972 to 515 million in 1973.

Although the volume of sales remained almost static during 1973, sales revenue increased by 36 per cent on account of the upward price revision of petroleum products made in August 1973.

The net trading profits is estimated to be Rs. 42 million as against Rs. 35 million in 1972. The foreign exchange earnings of the Corporation recorded an increase from Rs. 69.3 million in 1972 to Rs. 1344 million in 1973.

(c) Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation

Imports of raw material and the mixing of fertilizer by the Corporation has continued to increase over the years. In the first nine months of 1973 the Corporation imported 276 thousand tons of fertilizer as against 274 thousand tons in the previous year. This was to meet the requirements of the government's agricultural programme.

The Corporation made a loss of Rs. 4 3 million for the nine months compared to a profit of Rs. 16.0 million in the previous year. In view of the rise in import prices of fertilizer, the Corporation had to increase its selling price in October, 1973. Meanwhile, the sales of fertilizer were limited in the last few months of the year as a result of the shortage of fertilizer in the world market.

(d) State Gem Corporation

State Gem Corporation showed a significant increase in its trading activities in 1973. Purchases of precious and semi-precious stones amounted to Rs. 107 million during the year, as a compared with Rs. 12 million in 1972. The total sales too, recorded a corresponding increase from Rs. 7.2 million in 1972 to Rs. 46.5 million in 1973. The value of stocks at the end of the year was Rs. 81.5 million, which is three times the sales turnover (without FEECs) for 1973. On the higher turnover in 1973, the Corporation made a profit of Rs. 8.8 million

(e) Paddy Marketing Board

In 1973, the value of paddy purchased by the Board is estimated at Rs. 436 million as against Rs. 368 million in 1972. The Board made a profit (before tax) of Rs. 8.5 million in 1973 as against Rs. 5.8 million in the previous year.

D. Electricity, Gas and Water

(a) Ceylon Electricity Board.

Data on the operations of the Board in 1973 along with comparable data for the last five financial years are shown in Table II (D) 15.

Generation of power by the Board has increased progressively over the years and was 983 million Kw in 1973. In the year under review, total revenue increased to Rs. 142 million. This was largely on account of an increase in earnings from electricity sales, arising from the increase in the price of electricity to the consumer, and the introduction of penalty rates for non-payment of bills on due dates. Despite the increase in revenue, profits declined from Rs. 38 million in 1972 to Rs. 31 million in 1973 on acccount of an increase in the costs of power generation. During the middle of the year, the Board introduced periodical power cuts as a conservation measure to tide over the acute shortage of rainfall in the main catchment areas of the hydrel reservoirs.
