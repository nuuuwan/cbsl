(I) EMPLOYMENT & L A B O U R RELATIONS

1. Introduction

It has been pointed out in earlier reports that the figures on employment and unemployment are not available except for census years or certain years during which data on employment had been collected. Even though 1971 was a census year it will take some time before the relevant figures are available for analysis. The only available figures of some relevance are the number of registrants for employment or better employment with the Employment Exchanges. Even though they are unsatisfactory as estimates of totals, they would broadly indicate trends.

With a view to supplementing these figures, the Central Bank conducts an annual inquiry into employment in the public sector. The Bank also obtains information on employees registered under the Employees' Provident Fund (E. P. F.) for which the latest available data are for the year 1970. The E. P. F. figures by themselves are incomplete as there are a number of approved private provident funds (A. P. P. F.). An attempt was made to achieve completeness by requesting these funds to supply relevant employment figures.

The Department of Census and Statistics conducted a Socio-Economic Survey of Ceylon covering the period of two months starting from 1. 11. 69. According to the results of this Survey 557,000 persons were unemployed while 3,518,000 persons were employed. Thus the unemployed comprised 14 per cent of the workforce.

2. Number Placed In Employment

the year 1971 was 3,556. Although the numbers placed in employment during the year in respect of all the categories of workers were more when compared with those of last year, the total placed in employment rose only by 0.1 percentage points.

3. Employment in the Public Sector

The response rate for the annual survey conducted by the Central Bank for the year 1971 in respect of employment in semi-government institutions (Public Corporations, Universities, Research Institutes, Boards, etc.) was good. To a similar inquiry into employment in the government service, the response from the government departments was poor. Figures for those government departments which did not respond to the inquiry were obtained from the Estimates of Government Revenue and Expenditure for 1970/71 and 1971/72 which give the approved cadre but may not be the numbers in actual employment.

The employees are classified according to categories and status (permanent), temporary and casual). The categories considered were:-

(i) Administrative, Technical and Professional officers of staff rank;

(ii) Sub-ordinate Employees;

(iii) Minor Employees;

(iv) School Teachers (in case of Government Departments);

(v) Others.

(a) Government Departments

The estimates of employment in government depatrments for the years 1970 and 1971 are shown in Table II (I) 2. As it is apparent from the table, the employment statistics in respect of the government departments also include data relating to government school teachers. In 1971, about 58 per cent of the total number of employees were in the subordinate and minor grades. Of these, subordinate employees accounted for 31 per cent while the minor employees accounted for 27 per cent of the total. In fact, the pattern of distribution among various categories was roughly the same as in 1970. Officers in the staff rank comprised 3 per cent of the total. The Government school teachers accounted for about 30 per cent of the total in both the years 1970 and 1971.

The share of the permanent employees to the total declined from 89.1 per cent in 1970 to 88.1 per cent in 1971 mainly due to a larger increase in the number of casual workers. Those in the temporary grades declined in absolute terms while their share fell from 5.6 per cent in 1970 to 5.1 per cent in 1971. However, the casual workers have increased from 5.3 per cent in 1970 to 6.8 per cent in 1971.

The total number of employees in the government departments increased by 3.0 per cent in 1971. The officers in the administrative grades recorded the highest increase of 13.4 per cent over the figure for 1970. The number in the subordinate grades and school teachers recorded increases of 7.4 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively. The number of minor employees, however, recorded a decrease of 2.6 per cent in 1971.

The rate of absorption into employment in Semi-Government Institutions declined in 1971. The percentage increases in the total employment in 1971 and 1970 were 3.3 and 8.3 respectively. ' This decline in the rate of expansion is reflected in all the categories except the category of 'others'. The percentage increases of the employment in the categories of'staff rank' and 'subordinate employees' were 9.4 and 8.2 respectively; the corresponding figures for 1970 being 10.5 and 9.7. In the case of minor employees there was a decline of 2.3 per cent whereas the employment in the category of 'others' registered an increase of 53.5 per cent.

In 1971, 68 per cent of the employees in Semi-Government Institutions had been in the category of minor employees. The corresponding figure for 1970 was 72 per cent. The proportions of administrative officers and the subordinate officers for years 1970 and 1971 were roughly the same, while the percentages of the employees in the other category were 5.8 and 8.7 respectively.

In 1971 about 81 per cent of the total employees were in the permanent category while the corresponding percentage for 1970 was about 74. Casual employees consisted of about 13 per cent'of the total employees in 1971. The corresponding percentage for this category for 1970 was 19. For 1970 and 1971, about 7 per cent of the total employees were temporary.

4. (a) Employees registered under the Employees' Provident Fund

The latest available figures on the number of employees registered under the E. P. F. are in respect of the year 1.970. The employees registered under

I the E. P. F. have been classified according to main industrial categories. These figures are reported below for the years 1967 to 1970.

This is therefore a rough classification.

( 210 )

Of the total number of employees registered with E. P. F. in 1970, 69 per cent were in Agriculture, 12 per cent in Manufacturing and 11 per cent in Trade and Transport. The general pattern of distribution has been the same as in the past years. The number of employees under the E. P. F. rose by 4.3 per cent in 1970 over the figure for 1969. This increase constituted nearly 68 per cent of the increase in workforce. There has been a drop in the annual rate of increase in 1969. However, the average annual growth for the period 1967-70 was 3.5 per cent. In 1970, the largest increase occurred in Other Agriculture (by 27 per cent), while there were substantial increases in Construction (by 12 per cent), Manufacturing (by 10 per cent), Services (by 7 per cent), and Trade and Transport (by 6 per cent).

The Table II (I) 5 gives the distribution of registered employees under the E. P. F. according to industry and district as at end of 1970.

Of the total number of registered employees under the E. P. F. 22 per cent were in industries situated in the Colombo district, 16 per cent in Kandy, 10 per cent in Ratnapura, 9 per cent each in Nuwara Eliya and Badulla, 7 per cent in Galle, and 6 per cent each in Kegalle and Matara. The pattern of distribution has been almost the same as in the previous years. Of the total number of registered employees in the Colombo district, 42 per cent were in Manufacturing, 31 per cent in Trade and Transport, and 16 per cent in the Services. Most of the employees in other districts were engaged in agricultural pursuits. The general pattern of distribution of.'employees in Manufacturing, Construction, Trade and Transport, and Services in most of the districts was similar.

(b) Employees in Approved Private Provident Funds

The other main source of registered employees in the Private Sector is the Approved Private Provident Funds (A. P. P. F.). During the year, the Central Bank requested these Funds to furnish the number of members in the Funds and the description of the main businesses in which the members were employed. The response was satisfactory. However, a good number of small Funds did not send in their returns and their trades are left unclassified. The department of Labour furnished the aggregate total numbers in all the Funds. Table II (I) 6 shows the industry-wise classification of employees registered under A.P.P.F.

The registered employees in the Approved Private Provident Funds also in-elude the staff of some of the large State Corporations and Institutions such as the Ceylon Transport Board, and the Ceylon Electricity Board.

It is evident from the table that in 1971 the largest increases have occurred in Services (by 13 per cent) and Manufacturing (by 9 per cent). The average annual increase in the total number of employees in the Funds was about 2 per cent during the years 1969/71.

5- Registrants for Employment

The number of registrants at Employment Exchanges for employment or better employment at the end of 1971 was 435,224 compared with 410,920 "at the end of the previous year. In 1971, the registrants for technical and clerical employment decreased by 3,014 as against an increase of about 13,300 in the previous year. In the skilled category, the number registered in 1971 was 3,758 and this was less than that in 1970. In 1970 and 1971, the number of registrants

for unskilled work was roughly 39,000 and 21,200 respectively.

The rate of increase of registrants at Employment Exchanges slowed down from 22 per cent in 1970 to 6 per cent in 1971. However, the number registered as unskilled grew at 9 per cent. The unskilled category still predominated with 46 per cent of the total while skilled workers accounted for the lowest proportion (of 10 per cent) among all categories.

In 1971, the number of strikes in the plantations sector was 125 as compared with 254 in 1970. There was a decrease in the number of workers involved in strikes from 125,530 in 1970 to 50,847 in 1971. In the category of "Other Em­ployments'- too, the number of strikes was less in 1971 than the number in ,1970.

In comparison with the figures for 1969 there was an increase of about 80 per cent in the total number of strikes in 1970. However, the situation changed completely in 1971. In 1971, the number of strikes fell by 54 per cent from that of 1970. The total number of strikes that took place in 1971 in plantations and other employments was 157 of which 93 occurred during the first 3 months of the year.

Wage disputes were less important than general working conditions in the strikes of 1971. Nearly 27 per cent of the. work stoppages was on account of demands for better working arrangements and disputes with sub-staff. It is not possible to estimate the economic loss in the value added as a consequence of these stoppages but judging from the number of man-days lost it was not signifi­cant compared to the loss in 1970. However, it should be noted that the "state of emergency" would have reduced the number of strikes but the man-days lost due to the island-wide curfew in certain months would have been large.
