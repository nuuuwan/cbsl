(B) INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION1

1. Introduction

Information relating to industrial activity both in the private and public sectors, during the year 1971 was ascertained by a postal questionnaire addressed to industrial units which were registered with the Ministry of Industries St. Scien­tific Affairs. Personal visits to industrial units, where necessary, and the statistics provided by the Ministry of Industries and Scientific Affairs proved to be useful and helped to expedite the collection of data.

The purpose of this survey of performance in the industrial sector is to analyse the progress made in the various branches of industry, assess the contribu­tion made by the various sectors to total industrial growth and focus attention on the principal features relating to production, employment, wages, man-hours, cost of fuel and power and raw materials.

Before an evaluation of industrial activity is made, it would be pertinent to mention some of the constraints which beset the industrial sector during the year 1971. Hitherto, industrial production has been hampered by constraints such as reduced quotas of foreign raw materials, a situation which has arisen due to scarce foreign exchange resources. In 1971, in addition to the limited quota of foreign raw materials made available, a further set-back in industrial activity was witnessed during the civil disturbances in the first half of the year. It is noteworthy that inspite of these constraints, the tempo of industrial production has been maintained and even increased in certain industrial sectors.

The overall value of industrial production recorded by 1897 reporting units, rose from Rs. 1,945.0 million in 1970 to Rs. 2,239.4 million in 1971, reflecting an increase of 15.1 per cent, which is about 7 per cent higher than the increase in 1970. While the share of the public sector industries in total industrial production decreased from 31.0 per cent in 1970 to 30.3 per cent in 1971, its contribution to the increase in production in 1971 was 41.0 per cent. The increase in the value of industrial production may be partly attributed to the increase in the cost of raw materials whose general upward trend in prices has resulted in price escalations of manufactured goods.

2. Principal trends

Industrial Policy

The Section on Industrial Production appearing in the Central Bank Annual Report of 1970, made special comment on three of the major government policy decisions relating to industrial development, namely:

1. Reference to production in this section is to value of production and not to physical output. The value of production has been affected by increases in the turn-over tax and higher prices of raw materials.

( 31 )

(a) the encouragement and fostering of those industries where there would be a greater utilisation of indigenous raw materials;

(b) exploring the possibilities, wherever feasible, of the State importing industrial raw materials in bulk for supply to local manufacturers;

(c) quality and price control of manufactured goods.

These policy decisions have since been implemented.

Regarding the utilisation of local raw materials, already there are indications that certain industries are using more local raw materials, and that parts and accessories are being turned out locally for final assembly of products. It is believed that Government's policy with regard to the provision of incentives to industries utilising local raw materials is begining to have its effects.

Location of Industry

As mentioned in the Central Bank Annual Report for 1970, a very high percentage of industrial units are located in the Western Province, especially in close proximity to the metropolis. It is premature to comment on the effect of Government's recent policy, for a wider regional diffusion in the establishment of industries. The data given in Table II (B) 8 show that the number of industrial units in the Western Province as a percentage of total units has decreased from 81.3 per cent in 1970 to 78.9 per cent in 1971. Provinces which have shown increases in the number of units are the Sabaragamuwa (0.2 to 1.7 per cent), Central (4.9 to 5.6 per cent), Northern (3.3 to 3.8 per cent), and Southern (5.2 to 5.5 per cent).

The dispersion of industrial units in the rural areas will not only relieve overcrowding and attendant social problems but to some extent alleviate the problem of unemployment and under-employment in these areas.

Production

As in 1970, all nine major categories listed in Table II (B) 1 contributed to the increase in the value of production of Rs. 294.4 million recorded in 1971. Two categories which contributed in large measure to this increase rwere, Chemi­cals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products (41.6 per cent) and Food, beverages and tobacco (19.8 per cent). These two categories also account for 58.3 per cent of total industrial production in 1971.

Production data relating to the sub groups of the major categories are given in Table II (B) 2. The three sub groups Tobacco, Vegetable oils and fats and Food Preparations were responsible for the increase in production in the major category Food, beverages and tobacco. One sub group in this category, namely, Preserved and canned fruits, vegetables, meat, fish and other sea foods has recorded a marked increase of 100 per cent in the value of production. This is not surprising, because, in addition to increased local consumption of these products, the demand for Ceylon's canned and preserved foods is gradually increasing in foreign markets. Incidentally, about 8 per cent of the output of preserved and canned foods is exported. This is one of the industries where there is much scope for expansion and which could develop into an important foreign exchange earner. In the category Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries, moderate

gains in output were recorded by the sub groups Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles, and Knitted fabrics and garments. About 50 per cent of the inctease in production in the category Paper and paper products, was accounted for by a State enterprise, while the balance was contributed by a few packaging and wrapping paper industries.

Among the nine major categories, the highest increase in production was recorded by the category Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products from Rs. 439.2 million in 1970 to Rs. 561.7 million in 1971. This increase of 27.9 per cent was almost entirely contributed by two sub groups, namely, Miscelle-aneous chemical products and Rubber products. A notable increase in production of 47-7 per cent in the sub group Miscellaneous chemical products was chiefly due to increased output of paint, soap and cosmetic industries. A still more significant increase of about 63 per cent in the value of production of Rubber products was largely the result of an expansion in output of the State Tyre Corporation by more than 100 per cent.

There were no appreciable increases in output in the sub groups of the category Non-metallic mineral products, except in Bricks and tiles which recorded an increase of 136 per cent. In the case of Cement, cement products and asbestos products sub group, the increase in output of 11.4 per cent in 1971 was lower than the average of 22 per cent recorded over the last four years.

A substantial increase in production of 50.6 per cent in the Basic metal products category was entirely contributed by a State enterprise. In the category Fabricated metal products, machinery and transport equipment, although the overall increase in output was only 6.8 per cent, the increase in output in the sub group Fabricated metal products alone was as much as 32.1 per cent. A striking relationship is observed in the increased output of the Basic metal products category and the sub group Fabricated metals.

It is evident that the sharp increase in output in the Basic metals category, which is a 'feeder' industry, has boosted production in the sub group Fabricated metals.

A classification of industrial sub groups according to increase in value of production is at Table II (B) 2 (1).

Increases in production were recorded in all industrial sub groups except in Beverages and spirits, Machinery (other than electrical) and Transport equipment, and Electrical machinery. The sub group Miscellaneous Chemical products which had an increase of between Rs 0-5 million in 1970, recorded the highest increase in output of over Rs 50 million in 1971. Vegetable oils and fats and Rubber products which were in the Rs 0-5 million category and Fabricated metals which had an increase of between Rs 5-20 million in 1970, have all moved into the Rs 20-50 million catetgory in 1971. On the other hand, two sub groups which had increases in output of between Rs 5-20 million and one sub group with an increase of between Rs 20-50 million in 1970 have been classified in the Rs 0-5 million and Rs. 5-20 million categories respectively.

Table II (B) 2 (2) depicts the change in the number of industrial units in the 9 major categories of industry, and the corresponding change in the value of production during the period 1970-71. Although there was a drop in the number of reporting units in some of the major categories, yet the value of output in all the categories has increased. The contraction in the number of units in the Food, Beverages and Tobacco category was due to the exclusion of about 100 beedi manufacturing units, which were not in operation in 1971 for lack of raw materials. In the Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries category, a large increase in the number of units was due to a number of additional units in the wearing apparel sub group. Substantial increases in the value of output by a few

( 38 )

large units were responsible for the increase in output in the category Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products, where there was no change in the number of units.

3. Structure and pattern of Industrialisation

Data relating to the value of production for the period 1967-71 as provided in Table II (B) 2, indicate a definite trend in the pattern of production. In the categories Food, beverages and tobacco and Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries, the percentage shares of total output which were 44.3 and 18.6 per cent respectively in 1967, have gradually decreased to 33.2 and 13.7 per cent respectively in 1971. These two categories which accounted for 62.9 per cent of total output in 1967 contributed only 46.9 per cent in 1971. The opposite trend in production is observed in the Chemicals, and the Fabricated metal products categories where there has been a gradual increase in output from 14.3 and 10.7 per cent respectively in 1967 to 25,1 and 12.2 per cent respectively in 1971.

Sub groups which increased their shares of output appreciably within their parent categories are Miscellaneous chemical products, Rubber products, Bricks and tiles and Fabricated metal products.

Table II (B) 3 gives a classification of industrial production by the major economic categories, namely, consumer goods, intermediate goods and investment goods, which account for 52,31 and 17 per cent of industrial production respec­tively. Though there was no significant change in the relative shares of these three major categories, in the value of production, a slight increase of 4.4 per cent was recorded in the consumer goods category with a similar decrease in inter­mediate goods. Consumer goods which contributed mainly to the increase in production were dairy products, preserved and canned foods, shirts, soaps, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, while the corresponding intermediate products were metal containers, electrical machinery &. supplies and petroleum and coal products. In the investment goods category, there were increases in the output of bricks, tiles, cement, cement products and asbestos products.

4- Size of the industrial unit

Data relating to size distribution of industrial units based on value of output as given in Table II (B) 4 show that a major share of output is concentrated in a few large units. Of a total of 1,539 units, 1,104 units whose value of output is less than Rs 250,000 account for only 3.7 per cent of the total output, while 140 units whose value of output is over Rs 2 million contribute 84-5 per cent of total output. Statistics for the last five years reveal this trend; the percentage share of output of the larger units is gradually increasing. Since 1967 the proportionate share in total production taken away by the large establishments has been increasing. Whereas in 1967 large units with over Rs 2 million output accounted for 66 4 per cent while those with less than Rs 250,000 accounted for 8.3 per cent, in 1970 the former category increased its share to 82.8 per cent while the latter reduced its share to 4.0 per cent. Although the overall pattern of distribution of output among the ranges shov. n in Table II (B) 4 remains the same, the degree of concentration of output in the large scale units varies in a

few categories. In the Textiles, Paper, Fabricated metal products and Manufactured products, N.E.S. categories, the concentration of output in the larger units (Rs 2 million and over) is comparatively less than in the other categories, while the medium scale units (Rs 250,000 and less than Rs 2 million) in these four categories contributed an appreciable share of production.

In the Footwear and leather products industry, 3 units account for 70 per cent of output, while 2 units each in the Soft drinks and Biscuits industries, produce 86 and 83 per cent of output, respectively.

( 41 )

Data relating to the size distribution of industrial units based on the wage bill given in Table II (B) 5 also show a similar trend in wages being concen­trated in a few large units. In 1971, 75 units out of a total of 1,539 within the units with an output of over Rs. 500,000, accounted for 73 per cent of total wages, while units having an output of less than Rs. 15,000 had 850 units accounting for only 2.3 per cent ot the total wage bill. Statistics for the last 5 years show that the share of establishments whose production was less than Rs. 15,000 has been decreasing from 4.1 per cent in 1967 to 2.3 per cent in 1971, while the share of those firms with an output of over Rs. 500,000 has increased from 58.4 per cent to 73 per cent.

The information provided in Table II (B) 4 (1) in respect of industrial units having an output exceeding Rs 1 million confirms the trend in the local industrial sector, where a few large industrial units account for a major share of output, wages, and employees. As may be seen, only 198 units or 10.4 per cent of the total number had 54.6 per cent of total employees, accounted for 73.9 per cent of the total wage bill and took away 71.6 per cent of the value of industrial production.

5. Employment and wages

In 1971, although there was an overall marginal increase in the number of reporting units, the total number of employees fell from 105,105 to 98,365. This was accompanied by a decrease in the total number of man-days of about 19.5 per cent. Inspite of the decrease in the number of employees and man-days, increases were recorded in total wages, output and wage per man-day.

The decrease in the total number of employees is mainly attributed to a contraction in employment in the category Food, beverages and tobacco, where about 100 beedi manufacturing units have gone out of production, and in the Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries category,, where there was a reduction of employees in the sub group Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles. However, a decrease in the number of employees in these two categories has had no impact on the overall output of this group because,£a few large units in these categories have recorded appreciable increases in production.

The total wage bill of reporting units rose from Rs 229.4 million in 1970 to Rs 245.0 million in 1971, reflecting an increase of 6.8 per cent. Appreciable gains in wages were recorded in the Chemicals (22.8 per cent), and Fabricated metal products (35.4 per cent ) categories, while there was a decrease in the categories Food, beverages and tobacco (7.1 per cent) and Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries (5.9 per cent). The categories which have the highest wage bills, are Food, beverages and tobacco (24-4 per cent) and Chemicals (19.6 percent). These two categories which produce 58.3 per cent of total output, employ 38,928 persons or 39.6 per cent of total employees, who receive 44.0 per cent of total wages.

Increases in wages in the industrial sector during 1971 are reflected in the wage per man-day which has increased in all nine major categories. The data in respect of man-days per employee is very revealing because there is a drop in the man-days worked during the year in all major categories. This is explained by the temporary disruption of activity in the industrial sector during the civil disturbances in the first half of 1971.

6. The use of raw materials

As may be seen in Table II (B) 6, about 50 per cent of the value of production comprises the value of raw materials used. But the overall pattern of raw material utilisation in local industry in 1971 remained unchanged. As in the past years, 75 per cent of raw materials used in industry were imported. However, on a detailed analysis of data for the various categories of industry, it is encouraging to note that at least in two categories, namely, Food beverages and tobacco and Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries a perceptible change is observed in the proportion of local to foreign raw materials consumed. The local component in these two categories has increased from 37.6 and 26.9 per cent respectively in 1970 to 42.4 and 40.3 per cent respectively in 1971. In some of the other categories, local raw materials figure prominently in sub groups such as Miscellaneous chemicals, Rubber products and Cement, cement products and asbestos products to the extent of 50 per cent of the total raw materials used,

Government's policy with regard to the encouragement and fostering of those industries where there would be a greater utilisation of indigenous raw materials, could change the pattern of raw material utilisation, and thus effect a reduction in the import of foreignraw materials.

. 7. Use of Power and fuel

The cost of power and fuel as seen in Table II (B) 7 comprises 3 per cent of the value of output. The share of petroleum and oil in total consumption of power and fuel is 53.3 per cent while electricity, and coal and gas account for 42.2 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. Categories which consume a high percentage of electricity are Food, beverages and tobacco, Paper and paper products, Basic metal products, and Fabricated metal products, machinery and transport equipment. Petrol and oil which are also widely used are the chief fuels in the Chemicals and Non-metallic mineral products categories.
