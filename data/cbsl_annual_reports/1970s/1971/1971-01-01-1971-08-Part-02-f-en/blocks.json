On the other hand, total revenue was Rs 63 million less than originally anticipated. Consequently, the budget deficit showed an increase of Rs 147 million over the originally estimated figure. Towards financing this increased deficit, domestic market borrowing contributed Rs 151 million more than originally forecast. Domestic non-market borrowing i. e. administrative borrowings, of Rs 140 million, not originally anticipated in the budget, and a heavy drawing down of cash balances (including counterpart funds) to the tune of Rs 123 million, helped to contribute the balance amount.

For the first time, a provision of a net payment (of Rs 125 million) in respect of Advance Account Operations has beenmade. It has been thepractice in the past to regard the impact of these operations on the Budget as balancing, whereas, in fact, in the more recent years, there have been substantial outpayments on these accounts. Consequently, the eventual budget deficits had been larger than originally anticipated, and with no provision made in the original estimates, they led invariably to an increase in the net expansionary impact of fiscal operations. It should be noted that the original estimates, as - they are presented in the Table, take into account certain modifications made to the budget proposals which increased the budget deficit from Rs 1513 million, as forecast in the Budget Speech, to Rs 1798 million2. This budget deficit is to be financed by domestic market borrowing of Rs 1086 million and foreign finance of Rs 712 million.

In that period, tevenue rose by 9.3 pet cent and expenditure by 11.5 per cent per annum (recurrent expenditure 12.6 per cent and capital expenditure 6.7 per cent). It will thus be seen that despite a higher rate of increase in Government revenue, expenditure has been risiftg at a still faster rate during the last five years.

    "text": "The progressive increase in budget deficits had been financed by increased borrowings from domestic and foreign sources. Foreign resources have, in recent times, made substantial contributions towards financing the budget deficits. Their contributions have increased progtessively since 1961/62 and reached a level of 45 per cent of the total budget deficit in 1968/69. Since that year, however, their share has decreased gradually, and in 1970/71 it amounted to about 28 per cent. This decline has been primarily due to the decreased receipts of foreign assistance (compared particularly with originally anticipated receipts). Gross foreign resources utilised in 1969/70 and 1970/71 for budgetary purposes amounted to Rs 345 million and Rs 370 million1 as against the originally anticipated amounts of Rs 502 million and Rs 638 million respectively. The expected foreign finance in 1971/72 (12 months) is Rs 570 million. The decline in the relative share of foreign finance may represent a shift towards increased mobilisation of domestic resources for financing the budget deficits. The last two budgets have made a conscious attempt to do so with a view to achieving internal stability and to reducing external imbalance.",

It is true that an increasing proportion of the capital expenditure shown in the Table represents debt repayments. However, the trend remains basically the same in respect of capital expenditure excluding debt repayments. While the capital expenditure of the Government almost doubled during the last five years, the current account, the surplus on which represents Government savings, has recorded substantial deficits in more recent years. Even the surpluses attained in the other years have either been very little or negli\u00adgible. The surpluses and deficits in the current account over the past ten years have occurred with a degree of irregularity, that it is difficult to talk of a trend. However, it is clear that during the last five years the Governtment has not been able to generate sufficient surpluses on current account to finance the considerably increased capital expenditure. .

    "text": "The Table also shows that the growth rate of recurrent expenditure since 1967/68, has continued to outstrip the growth of GNP. The Government revenue-GNP ratio throughout the last ten years has been around 23 per cent, with a slight upward trend since 1967/68. Incrementally, however, Government revenue has risen by Rs. 1000 million since 1964/65 and Ceylon has managed, by the standards of most developing countries, to maintain a high tax - GNP ratio over the years. Yet it is this comparatively high level of taxation that increases the need for Government savings. Government savings become increasingly important to the extent that private savings capacity is reduced by reduction in disposable incomes. Moreover, the Compulsory Sayings Scheme during 1971/72 is aimed at limiting disposable incomes to Rs. 2,000 per 'month. Government savings also become important to the extent that transfer expenditures of the Government encourage private consumption rather than savings. Almost one-half of the total current expenditure of the Government is made up of transfer payments, of which, the gross food subsidy accounts for roughly one-half while pensions, interest on public debt, reliefs etc., account for the balance.",

    "text": "and the material wealth of the country\".1 The necessary condition for such a shift is a surplus of Government's revenue over its current expenditure. It is estimated that the surplus on Government's current account will rise from Rs. 112 million in 1972 to Rs. 383 million in 1976.2 These Government savings are expected to finance 4 per cent of the gross investment of Rs. 2,565 million planned for 1972, rising progressively to 11 percent of the planned investment of Rs. 3,394 million in 1976. Current account surpluses of such dimensions, when viewed in the light of past experience, require a major change in budgetary policy. It will depend essentially on the Government's ability to contain the increase in current expenditure within limits imposed by the potential for raising increased revenue and the need to generate an adequate surplus. It will also depend on fiscal and tax measures which will divert to Government revenue a portion of the increase in incomes during the Plan-Period. Although the Budgets for 1970/71 and 1971/72 have made a conscious attempt to keep these objectives broadly in view, the current account, which was originally anticipated to produce a surplus of Rs. 57 million in the Budget for 1971/72, has now turned into a deficit of Rs. 229 million (Rs. 182 million for 12 months), as a result of the modification and non-implementation of certain budgetary proposals.3",

    "text": "The budgetary problem confronting Ceylon basically arises from the fact that, while, on the one hand, the tax-GNP ratio is comparatively high, on the other, the structure of commitment of social policies - particularly food subsidies and education - has entailed growing recurrent expenditure commitments. Had Ceylon experienced rapid economic growth, it is possible that these expenditure commitments would have been met, and, in addition, that adequate funds could have been mobilized for stimulating and sustaining a high rate of growth of the economy. When allowance is made for the foreign exchange and structural problems of the economy, the problem remains that the internal resources required to exploit the growth opportunities cannot be generated so long as growth of Government expenditure continues to stimulate consumption at the expense of investment. Moreover, with the growth rate of recurrent expenditure outstripping the growth of GNP in the past few years, unless savings rise at a faster rate, aggregate demand will rise with its consequent adverse impact on the balance of payments position and the prospects for stable growth as well. A concerted attempt to keep the growth of recurrent expenditure low, in order to generate higher surpluses on current account, therefore becomes imperative.",

The effect of the above shortfalls was partly offset by higher than expected receipts from turnover taxes (Rs. 47 million), income tax (Rs. 18 million), profits and dividends from State Corpora\u00adtions (Rs. 14 million) and personal tax (Rs. 10 million).",

    "text": "Income tax on individuals and firms constitutes almost the entirety of the revenue from this source.1 The increase in income tax collections in 1970/71 over the previous financial year was only Rs. 3 million. The collections were, however, Rs. 19 million more than the original estimate for the year. The orginal estimate of Rs. 425 million included an expected receipt of Rs. 100 mil\u00adlion from the demonetisation exercise of October/November, 1971. In the event, total tax collections on account of demonetisation amounted to only Rs. 13 million. Of this sum, Rs, 8.5 million was collection of arrears of tax, Rs. 1.7 million was additional tax collected, while the balance amount was col\u00adlected under amnesty declarations. Despite the shortfall in the expected receipts from demonetisation, it is noteworthy that actual collections were, in fact, more than the original estimate in 1970/71. The 10 per cent increase in the income tax payable by companies for the Year of Assessment 1970/71, which was intro\u00adduced in lieu of compulsory savings contributions originally expected from firms, partly accounts for this increase. In addition, an expeditious issue of assess\u00adment in respect of previous years in anticipation of the switch-over to PAYE system helped to increase collections. Better enforcement of taxes, particularly through decentralisation, the prompter collections of arrears as well as investi\u00adgations carried out in certain trades where large scale evasion was suspected, also contributed to the increase in collections of income tax.",

The introduction of the PAYE system with effect from October 1971 is expected to widen the tax net by the addition of new tax-payers. Further, the 10 per cent increase in the income tax payable by companies in lieu of compulsory sav\u00adings is expected to continue to be in force during the Year of Assessment 1971/72. Thus, unlike in the past two years where the originally anticipated collections were estimated to be lower than the actual collections of the preceding years, the receipts during 1971/72 are expected to exceed the actual receipts of 1970/71.

Improved enforcement of the tax by the Inland Revenue Department also contributed to the increased tax receipts. The expected increase of Rs. 41 million in turnover tax collections in 1971/72 (12 months) is due mainly to a further increase in the rate of tax on petrol from 37 per cent to 48 per cent as well as to an additional Rs. 10 million from the imposition of turnover tax on pawn-broking business.*",

The increase in the excise duty on tobacco from Rs. 37.50 per lb. to Rs. 42.50 per lb. in 1970/71 accounted for this increase. Ad-valorem tea tax collections declined due to the lower level of prices at the London Auctions.

They were lower by Rs; 24 million as compared with the collections , during the previous financial year. Import duty collections recorded major decreases in respect of Mineral pro\u00adducts (Rs. 24 million), Vehicles etc. (Rs. 11 million) and Machinery etc. (Rs. 4 million). These decreases were partly offset by significant increases of Rs. 18 million in respect of Textiles and Rs. 9 million in respect of Foodstuffs, beverages, etc. The delays in obtaining imports which were earmarked for 1970/71 and the generally lower volume of imports explained the general decrease in import duty collections. It should also be noted that the O.G.L. Scheme was in operation during the first eight months of 1969/70. The sharp decrease in duty collections on mineral products was mainly due to decreased imports of refined petroleum products. The withdrawal of the concession granted to Salu Sala Ltd., for the import of textiles free of duty resulted in increased duty collections on textiles. Revenue from import duties also showed a decline of Rs. 6 million as compared with the original estimates for the financical year under review.",

The fall in the receipts from sale of FEECs was due mainly to the lower level of imports and to the heavy utilization of import credits during the course of the financial year. The receipts in 1970/71 were, also, lower than the budgeted estimates by Rs. 61 million.

Of this, Rs. 9 million was expected to accrue during the financial year 1970/71. This increase, however, was not realised mainly because of the curtailed Railway services as a result of the insurgent activity.

The main contributories to the increase in 1970/71 were, interest on public debt (Rs 83 million), pensions (Rs 42 million) and food subsidies (Rs 27 million). These increases were partly offset by a decrease of Rs 12 million in transfers to the household sector. The increase of Rs 83 million in interest on public debt was brought about as a result of higher than anticipated volume of borrowing as well as by increased interest rates payable on new borrowings. The payment of pensions and gratuities consequent to the enforcement of retirement at the age of 55 years explains the increase in the pensions bill. The reasons for the increase in the food subsidy are explained in detail in a later section on \"Net Food Subsidy\".",

The increase in transfers to corporations in the agricultural sector was mainly due to an initial grant of Rs. 48 million to the Mahaweli Development Board. The decline in transfers to corporations in the industrial sector was mainly due to the reduced contributions received by the National Textile Corporation (Rs. 34 million), Eastern Paper Mills Corporation (Rs. 12 million), Ceylon Plywoods Corporation (Rs. 8 million) and State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation (Rs 11 million). An initial grant of Rs. 15 million to the State Gem Corporation partly offset these reductions. Capital transfers to the fishing sector increased by Rs. 11 million.",

The Net Food Subsidy thus shown was, essentially, arrived at by deducting the profits on the import and sale of mainly sugar and flour from, the total cost of food subsidy. In the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure of the Government for 1971/72, however, the actual cost of food subsidy, i.e. the gross food subsidy, is shown as an expenditure item, whereas the profits from the sale of foodstuffs are shown as a revenue item. This departure from past practice is in keeping with the new economic and functional basis on which the revenue estimates for 1971/72 were presented.",

    "text": "The gross food subsidy increased by Rs. 27 million or 5 per cent in 1970/71 (provisional) as against a decrease of Rs. 51 million or 8 per cent in the previous year. The decrease in 1969/70 was due mainly to a reduction of Rs. 39 million or 7 per cent in the subsidy on rice. Decreases of Rs. 8 million in respect of rice ration coupons surrendered in lieu of repayment of loans granted by c o \u00adoperative societies, Rs. 3 million on distribution expenses and other charges and Rs. 2 million on subsidy on locally produced red onions, partly offset by an increase of Rs. 2 million on subsidy on other subsidiary foodstuffs, also accounted for the fall in the gross subsidy. The subsidy on rice decreased mainly as a result of a fall in the average landed cost of imported rice from Rs. 921 to Rs, 780 per long ton. The increase of 15,290 long tons in the issue of imported rice and a decrease of 19,276 long tons in the issue of local rice, reinforced the effect of the import price reduction. It should be noted that the per unit subsidy c n local rice is higher than that on imported rice.",

    "text": "The increase in gross food subsidy in 1970/71 over the previous year was Rs. 27 million or 5 per cent. The subsidy on rice increased by only Rs. 9 mil\u00adlion or 2 per cent, despi te increased issues of both imported and local rice. The total rice issued under ration increased by 368,051 long tons. No breakdown of this total issue in terms of imported and local rice is, however, available. The comparatively small increase in the subsidy on rice was once again primarily due to a fall in the average landed cost of imported rice from Rs. 780 to Rs.668 per long ton.The effect of this price decrease was more than offset by the effect of the increase in total issues of rice under ration. The increase in the total issues was essentially due to the decision to issue an additional measure of rice at 75 cents with effect from September 26, 1970. In 1970/71 the distribution expenses and other charges, too, increased by Rs. 25 million on account of the increased issues of rice consequent to the issue of the second measure of rice. The subsidy on locally produced red onions showed an increase of Rs. 3 million. Meanwhile, the subsidy on dhall decreased by Rs. 6 million.",

However, this increase is partly offset by a fall of Rs. 25 million in the distribution charges. The estimated increase in the subsidy on rice is mainly due to the expected increase in the purchase of local rice. These purchases are expected to increase from 400,000 long tons in 1970/71 to 600,000 long tons in 1971/72. No change is expected in the import price of rice in 1971/72. The reduction of Rs. 25 million in distribu\u00adtion charges is the result of apportioning the distribution charges in respect of all commodities handled by the Food Commissioner to each of these commodities",

The subsidy on rice is expected to increase by Rs. 49 million or 10 per cent. As compared with the approved estimates, this lower increase is mainly due to the decision to increase the price of the second measure of rice under ration by 25 cents. For the first time in recent history, the sale of flour is expected to show a loss of Rs. 11 million, and hence forms part of the gross food subsidy. The profits from the sale of flour have gradually declined since 1967/68 when its price was last increased by 5 cents a pound. The loss expected on the sale of flour in 1971/72 is mainly the result of netting off the distribution expenses in respect of this commodity against its whittled down profits. An increase in the import price of wheat flour from Rs. 671 to Rs. 703 per long ton expected during 1971/72 is also responsible for the conversion of profits into losses. The Food Commi\u00adssioner's estimates for 1971/72 do not provide for a subsidy on locally produced red onions, presumably on account of the increase in prices consequent to the ban on import of red onions.",

    "text": "The main reason for the high under-expenditure in the majority of minis\u00adtries in 1970/71 was the setback their capital programmes suffered as a result of the insurgency. It will be observed that the preponderant portion (69 per cent) of the under-expenditure in 1970/71 has occurred in the votes of the Ministries of Planning and Employment, and Irrigation, Power and Highways. The Ministries of Industries and Scientific Affairs, Agriculture and Lands, Housing and Construction, Posts and Telecommunications and Information and Broadcasting, too, recorded noticeable amounts of under-expenditure. Out of its total provision of Rs. 210 million, the Ministry of Planning and Employment has spent only a sum of Rs. 18 million. Thus, almost nine-tenths of the provi\u00adsions of this Ministry remained unspent at the end of the financial year. The under-expenditure of this Ministry in 1969/70 was 31 per cent. The very high under-expenditure of the Ministry of Planning in 1970/71 was due to the low level of expenditure in respect of the \"Short-term Employment Programme\". The actual expenditure incurred under this Programme was only Rs. 16 million as against the total provision of Rs. 208 million. The virtual non - implementation of the employment programme was primarily due to the disturbed conditions in the country during the year. The under-expenditure of Rs. 119 million, or 35 per cent, recorded by the Ministry of Irrigation, Power and Highways shows a marked increase over that of 1968/69 and 1969/70, when they were 23 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. This is mainly due to reduced expenditures on the provisions made for capital expen\u00additures in respect of economic development falling under \"Vote No. 7'' of the various departments of this Ministry. The re-organization of the technical services of the Ministry of Irrigation, Power and Highways, which involved the setting up of the territorial engineering service and the setback received as a result of the insurgency, broadly explain this high under-expenditure. The Ministries of Industries and Scientific Affairs and Agriculture and Lands show under-expen\u00additure of Rs. 33 million (or 25 per cent) and Rs. 32 million (or 23 percent) respectively. In contrast, the actual expenditure of the Ministry of Industries and Scientific Affairs exceeded the original provisions by 12 per cent in 1969/70. The Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, however, had recorded under-expenditures of 16 per cent in 1969/70. The under-expenditure by the Ministries of Housing and Construction, Posts and Telecommunications and Information and Broad\u00adcasting in 1970/71 amounted to Rs. 24 million or 41 per cent, Rs. 14 million or 67 per cent and Rs. 11 million or 58 per cent, respectively, whereas in 1969/70 they stood at 21 per cent, 44 per cent and 23 per cent respectively. In 1968/69, the under-expenditures by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications was 47 per cent and that of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was 44 per cent, while the Ministry of Housing and Construction was able to spend its allocations in full.",

The net payment in 1969/70 was a record Rs. 201 million, consisting of payments of Rs. 125 million to Government Departments, Corporations and Public Officers, Rs. 56 million under the Ceylon/China trade account and Rs. 22 million for stores, partly offset by a miscellaneous receipt of Rs. 2 million. The reduced payments of Rs. 93 million in 1970/71 over that of 1969/70 was brought about by decreases of Rs, 99 million in payments to Government departments etc., and Rs. 13 million for stores, partly offset by an increased payment of Rs. 17 million under the Ceylon/China trade account and an increase in miscellaneous payments of Rs. 2 million. The payment of Rs. 73 million under the Ceylon/China trade account, against an outstanding balance of Rs. 54 million in favour of the People's Republic of China, under this trade agreement, resulted in a balance of Rs. 19 million in favour of Ceylon as at end of September 1971. The net payment of Rs. 26 million to Government Departments etc., was mainly due to the out-payments of Rs. 38 million to the Ceylon Transport Board, Rs. 18 million to the Ceylon State Engineering Corporation and Rs. 15 million to the Railway, partly offset by a receipt of Rs. 45 million on account of food supplies.",

They thus increased by Rs. 3.3 million over the year. On the other hand, whereas the opening balance of the Central Bank Foreign Aid Counterpart Funds (Commodities) was Rs. 13-6 million, the dosing balance showed an overdrawn position of Rs. 112-8 million. Hence, this Fund would appear to have been reduced by Rs. 126.4 million over the year. The combined effect of these two operations would therefore amount to drawing down of cash balances to the extent of Rs. 123-1 million. The overdrawn position in the Central Bank Foreign Aid Counterpart Funds as In the Balance Sheet has arisen because the opening balance plus the receipts of Rs. 245-6 million during the course of the financial year, were insufficient to meet Rs. 372-1 million withdrawals made for budgetary purposes from the Fund.",

Includes a cash loan of Rs. 100 million from the People's Republic of China. In the financial years 1967/68 to 1969/70 the figure of credits to the foreign aid counterpart funds exceeds the receipts from non-project (commodity) loans due to the fact that the proceeds of some grants which were received in the form of commodities were also credited to the counterpart funds.

It was considerably lower (by Rs 197 million) than the impact in 1969/70, although the net cash deficit increased in magnitude during the year under review. The net receipts of foreign assistance in 1970/71 showed only a slight increase over 1969/70,1 while resources mobilised from domestic non-bank market sources increased substantially by Rs 213 million. Administrative borrowings of Rs. 141 million showed a consider\u00adable increase of Rs 125 million over 1969/70. Allowing for the heavy drawing down of cash balances (including foreign aid counterpart funds), it is clear that domestic non-bank market borrowings and administrative borrowings helped to limit the extent of bank borrowing in 1970/71 to a modest Rs 106 million.",

Moreover, the shortening of the terms of the loans from 21-25 years to 10-12 years has resulted in an increase in the rate of Sinking Funds contributions (from an annual contri\u00adbution of 21 per cent for a 21-25 years stock to 5 per cent for a 10-12 years stock); this, together with higher interest rates earned, had widened the investment capacity of Sinking Funds.",

The increase in investible funds of the private provident funds, consequent to the enhancement of the rates of E. P. F. contributions of employers and employees, together with the uncertainty prevalent in the private share market, may also have helped to increase the attraction of the Government bond market to the private sector. In the non-bank sector, the contributions from insurance companies, however, registered a fall of Rs. 10 million over 1969/70. This is to be explained by the fact that insurance companies faced with the gradual decline in their investible funds are primarily guided by liquidity considerations and the fact that prevailing interest rates have little bearing on their investment policy.",

Net of repayments, the gross external debt increased by Rs. 222 million. Taking into account an increase of Rs. 5 million in Sterling Loan Sinking Fund, the net external liability increased by Rs. 217 million. In the previous year, external borrowings less repayments amounted to Rs. 188 million. In 1969/70, when account is taken of a depreciation of Rs. 11 million in Sterling Loan Sinking Fund and the effect of revaluation of the Deutsche Mark (which increased the external debt by Rs. 15 million) the net external liability recorded an increase of Rs. 214 million.",

Programme budgeting re-presents the budget in terms of clearly identifiable programmes and activities and introduces physical data which will present a basis for evaluating budgetary performance against the Budget plan. It seeks to emphasize the primary function of the Budget as an instrument of management without in any way diminishing the importance of financial accountability, and provides a more rational basis for directing and controlling Government spending. It is expected that the esti\u00admates of other Ministries, too, will progressively be converted to the programme basis in the ensuing years.",

Further, it is proposed to make it obligatory for every person who has a turnover in excess of Rs. 18J750 for any quarter of the year, to furnish a return regardless of whether he is chargeable or not. According to the existing law, a person is chargeable with tax only where his liable turnover exceeds Rs. 75,000 for the year of assessment, and returns have to be furnished only by persons who are chargeable with turnover tax. It is anticipated that this measure would minimise cases of tax avoidance and also result in additional revenue. Where the aggreg\u00adate turnover of a business, however, is less than Rs. 75,000 for the four quarters of the year of assessment, provision will be made for the refund of the excess of tax paid.",

Total cost of the pensions bill as a percentage of Govern\u00adment expenditure rose from 4.0 per cent in 1950/51 to 7.0 per cent in 1970/71. It increased as a percentage of Government revenue from 3.6 per cent to 7.1 per cent during the same period.
