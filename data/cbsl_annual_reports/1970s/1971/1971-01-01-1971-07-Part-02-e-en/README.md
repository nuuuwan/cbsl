II (E) RURAL BANKING A N D CREDIT

1. The People's Bank 9topped the grant of credit under its Extended Credit Scheme from the beginningjof 1971.

The main sources of agricultural credit to the rural sector are the New Agricultural Credit Scheme and the Co-operative Rural Banks. In addition, institutional rural credit is provided by schemes operated by Government departments for specific purposes by commercial banks1 and by specialised credit institutions.

1 . Co-operative Rural Banks

Table II (E) 1 gives the deposits and loans of rutal banks on a quarterly basis. In 1971 twenty one rural banks were established, of which, twenty were set up in the last quarter of the year. The number of savings deposit accounts with the rural banks increased by 10,432 in 1971 over the previous year. The increase was marked in the final quarter of the year with 3,677 new accounts being opened in the twenty new rural banks set up in this quarter.

The volume of savings deposits which rose steeply to Rs. 16.1 million in the final quarter of 1970, following the demonetisation, declined to Rs. 14.8 million in the first quarter of 1971. Thereafter, the level of savings deposits showed a gradual increase during the year to Rs. 17.2 million at the end of 1971: this represented an increase of over Rs. 1 million or 6.7 per cent over the level prevailing at the end of 1970. It should be noted that as a result of demonetisa­tion savings deposits at the end of 1970 included a certain portion of cash balances that normally would have been hoarded in households for transactions purposes. It is likely that some of these deposits would have been withdrawn at the end of the first quarter of 1971, to meet a part of these transactions. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to compare the data for the first quarter of 1971, with the corresponding figure at the end of 1971. This comparison reveals an increase of Rs. 2.4 millon in savings deposits or a net increase of 16.2 per cent in the last nine months of 1971. Despite an increase in the number of savings deposit accounts in the last quarter of 1971, the volume of savings deposits showed only a moderate increase in the same period. The new savings deposits in the last quarter of 1971 amounted to Rs. 142,237 and represented only 5.9 per cent of the net increase in the last nine months of 1971. The average size of savings deposits, which had increased markedly to Rs. 322 in the final quarter of 1970, declined to Rs. 283 in the first quarter of 1971; it remained more or less unchanged during the rest of the year. However, for the year as a whole the average size of savings deposits was much higher in 1971 than in the preceding years as shown in Table II (E) 1,

Fixed deposit accounts were comparatively few in number. The average size of these deposits was much higher than savings deposits. The volume of fixed deposits showed a steady decline over the year; at the end of 1971 the total volume of fixed deposits was Rs. 676,106 or 15.4 per cent less than the level prevailing at the end of 1970. This decline in 1971 was a reversal of an increasing trend observed in the earlier years. The deposits in these accounts are fixed for

varying periods of 3,6 and 12 months. The rates of interest paid on these deposits are decided by each co-operative society; the average rate, in 1971, was around 5 per cent per annum.

The volume of lending in 1971 remained more or lesss at the level that prevailed at the end of the final quarter of 1970; the number of loan transactions, however, increased somewhat. The average size of loans declined over the first three quarters of the year. In the final quarter of 1971, the number of loan transactions and its volume of loans fell both because of a decline in the average size of loans and a reduction in the number of transactions. The volume of loans showed only a minimal increase in 1971 over the level that prevailed in 1970 as against an increase of Rs. 1.5 million in 1970 over that of 1969. This decline was mainly due to restrictions on lending imposed during the reorganisation of the co-operatives commenced in early 1971.

While total lending has not shown any appreciable increase over the level of 1970, production loans declined from Rs. 1.68 million to Rs. 1.52 million in 1971, as shown in Table 11(E) 2. This decline was largely a reflection of a reduction in the lending for cottage industry, from Rs. 0.228 million in 1970 to Rs. 0.115 million in 1971. Credit for agricultural production and animal husbandry remained around the same level attained in 1970. In consequence lending for all production purposes, as a proportion of the total, declined from 23.5 per cent in 1970 to 21.2 per cent in 1971. Credit extended for housing too showed a fall from Rs. 2.73 million in 1970 to Rs. 2.58 million in 1971; in proportionate terms it declined from 38.3 per cent to 36.2 per cent over the same period. There was a similar reduction in credit for debt redemption purposes. Loans for trading activity, consumption and 'other' loans showed a significant increase from Rs. 0.70 million to Rs. 1.19 million (or 70.4 per cent) during this period; their importance in total lending increased from 9.9 per cent to 16.6 per cent. Apparently, the re-organisation of the co-operatives and the restriction on loans above a certain size resulted in a decline in lending for production, housing, debt redemption and electrification while that for trade, consumption and miscellaneous purposes increased, causing an overall marginal increase in total lending.1

Total deposits of rural banks rose from Rs. 16.9 million at the end of December, 1970 to Rs. 17.9 million at the end of December, 1971. While these deposits fell in the first quarter they increased from Rs. 15.6 million in March to

Rs. 17.9 million in December of 1971- At the end of the year total deposits exceeded the volume of loans by Rs. 10.8 million. As mentioned in the previous year's Annual Report, the rapid increase in the volume of deposits between September and December 1970 was due mostly to the demonetisation; but three months later, in March 1971, the volume of deposits fell to Rs. 15.6 million.

1. Loans classified as 'other' include lending by one Co-operative Society prior to its amalgama­tion with a rural bank in 1971. If loans of this Society are excluded, total lending by rural banks in 1971 would be less than the corresponding figure for 1970 by 5.67 per cent.

Rural Banks also engage in pawn broking as agents of the People's Bank. The number of transactions on account of pawn broking rose from 18,092 in 1970 to 21,044 in the year under review and the extent of financing from Rs. 1,980,070 to Rs. 2,171,734 or by 9.7 per cent, as shown in Table 62 in Appendix II.

District-wise Analysis

The deposits and loans of rural banks are classified on a district basis in Table 62.

Colombo district had the largest number of rural banks, followed in importance by the districts of Kurunegala, Ratnapura, Polonnaruwa, Badulla and Kalutara. Nearly 25.5 per cent of the total volume of deposits was concent- i rated in the Colombo District. The total deposits in the Kurunegala district was Rs. 2.4 million, representing 13.4 per cent of the deposits and each of the districts of Ratnapura, Kandy, Badulla, Polonnaruwa and Kalutara had over a million rupees in deposits. These seven districts shared among them 75.4 per cent of the total deposits in all rural banks. The highest average size of deposit, at Rs. 516, was in the Jaffna district.

Credit granted for paddy cultivation in the Maha 1970-71 season, was Rs. 23.6 million or 40.1 per cent less than the level utilised in the Maha 1969-70 (i.e. Rs. 39-4 million). The volume of credit utilisation in Yala 1971 declined sharply to Rs. 5.5 million from its level of Rs. 12.3 million in Yala 1970. The level of credit utilisation which reached Rs. 61.4 million at its inception in Maha 1967-68 showed a declining trend. In the two seasons Maha 1970-71 and Yala 1971 credit utilised reached minimal levels as shown in the above table. This declining trend is generally ascribed to the high rates of default under the scheme.1 Defaulters were rendered ineligible for further credit under the scheme.

Rate of default progressively increased. In Maha 1970-71 only 39.0 per cent of the loans was repaid as compared to 49.7 per cent in the Maha of 1969-70 and 60.3 per cent in Maha 1968-69. Of the credit utilised in Yala 1971, 47.3 per cent was repaid, compared to 65.9 per cent in Yala 1970 and 79.8 per cent in Yala 1969. The higher level of recoveries in the period prior to 1970 was influenced to some extent by the recoveries made through the hypothecation of rice ration books of the borrowing households. Subsequent to the withdrawal of this requirement in 1970 recoveries consisted entirely of voluntary repayments.

However, repayments, that are due but which are not yet in default con­stituted 20.3 per cent and 50.9 per cent respectively of the loans granted in Maha 1970-71 and Yala 1971. Hence, the percentage level of recoveries could show further improvement in the course of the year. But even when the loans not in arrears are excluded, the percentage rate of default on loans taken in Maha 1970-71 was 40.7 as compared to 14.2 in Maha 1967-68 and 30.1 in Maha 1968-69; it was, however, less than the percentage level of defaults in Maha 1969-70 which was 48.5.

District-wise Analysis

The levels of credit utilisation and repayments declined in all districts except in Hambantota and Trincomalee in Maha 1970-71 and in all except Badulla and Batticaloa districts in Yala 1971, compared to the position that prevailed in the preceding Maha and Yala seasons respectively. This is shown in Table 63 in Apendix II. The deterioration in repayments was marked and conspicuously so in those districts that had maintained very high levels of repay­ments upto 1970, as shown in Table 64 in Appendix II.

Repayments in the Kandy district which were 99 per cent of the borrowings in Maha 1967-68, declined to 31 per cent in Maha 1970-71. Similarly, repay­ments in all other districts which had consistently good records of repayment upto 1970, deteriorated; the only exception was Badulla district in which repay­ments were over 80 per cent in Maha 1970-71-

1. The Central Bank conducted an all-Island Sample Survey in early 1972 to ascertain the reasons for the high rates of default on loans under this Scheme. The data gathered in the Survey are being processed.

( m )

A marked improvement in the repayment of loans taken in Yala 1971 was seen in Kegalle and Batticaloa districts and to a lesser degree in Ratnapura and Matara districts.1

. (b) Loans for Subsidiary Crops

Data on credit granted for subsidiary food crops in 1970-71 are given in Table 65 in Appendix II.

Loans granted for subsidiary crops declined irom Rs. 7.6 million in the period between October 1969— September 1970 to Rs. 5.1 million in the corres­ponding, period in 1970r-71. In general, the percentage of loans repaid too had fallen during the latter period. The repayments in respect of loans taken for potato cultivation declined from 94.2 per cent in 1969-70 to 74.6 per cent in 1970-71; that for vegetables from 84-7 per cent to 55.3 per cent and for red onions from 72.7 per cent to 53.8 per cent, in the corresponding periods. The major share of credit was given for chillies; red onions and potatoes. The Jaffna district continued to account for a significant share of the total loans taken for subsidiary crops.

3. Survey of Loan Defaults under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme.

The Economic Research Department conducted an all-island Sample Survey to ascertain the reasons for the high rate of default on loans taken under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme. The field work was completed during January and February, 1972 and the data gathered in the Survey are being processed.

1. Repayments in respect of borrowings made for Maha 1970/71 and Yala 1971 are still in progress and the level of repayments could show further improvement in the course of the year.
