In 1970/71 thirty corporations including banks and other financial institu­tions of the public sector have shown profits3. Of these, fifteen have made profits larger than those in the previous year; fourteen have made less profits, while one made a profit as against a loss in the previous year. Twelve enterprises including the Ceylon Government Railway have incurred losses in 1970/71- Of these, four have incurred bigger losses than in the previous year. Four have reduced losses and four have incurred losses as against a profit in the previous year. Public sector manufacturing enterprises reviewed here have made a profit before tax of approximately Rs 64 million in 1970/71 as against Rs 45 million in the previous year. The performance of these corporations would have shown a bigger improvement but for the severe foreign exchange constraint limiting their production.

2. The year 1970/71 refers to the financial year which is not uniform in these enterprises. 3. Profit and loss figures for 1970/71 are not available in respect of eight corporations.

In 1971 several new public corporations were established. The total number of corporations as at end of 1971 was 68, of which, 131 were established in this year. This is in keeping with the Government's policy of expanding the activities of the public sector. ,

Total investment in public enterprises amounted to Rs 3,461 million in 1970/7P as against Rs. 3,118 million in the previous year. Size of investment varied according to the structure of the undertaking. In 1970/71 capital employed on the average per employee was Rs 27,101. The table below gives the amount of capital invested by major categories.

Table II (C) 1

Total Capital Investment of Public Corporations *

( 48 )

Public sector industries in the past, rather than conserving their own resour­ces for re-investment have generally placed a financial burden on the government. More than two-thirds of the financial requirements of public industrial enterprises had to be provided from sources external to the corporations. It is, however, encouraging that the share of government contributions to total investment in industrial corporations has declined from 72 per cent in 1969/70 to 64 per cent in 1970/71 in spite of increased investment in this sector.

The overall improved performance of most public corporations in 1970/71 as judged from available information, has been due to better utilization of installed capacity, expansion of existing capacity and better planning. On account of delays in the publication of Annual Reports and Statements of Accounts, there continues to be a lack of useful timely information on the activities of State enterprises and consequently the usefulness of statements on the overall performance of the corporations sector is limited. Corporations should be required to publish these reports within a short period after the end of the accounting year.

The statistical data published in the following paragraphs and in the tables are those provided by the respective enterprises.

The data furnished in the Report are not final and are liable to revision when audited figures become available.

2. INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS

There were 22 industrial Corporations (including Fisheries) in 1970/71, but one of them (State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation) had not commenced production. The total capital invested in the Corporations that are in production increased by Rs 85 million from Rs 1,320 million in 1969/70. However, the capital used in production was Rs 928 million in 1970/71 or 66% of the invested capital. Value of production which increased by 29% in 1969/70 rose by 9.3% to Rs 591.1 millionin 1970/71. Among the Corporations that showed substantial increases in output were cement, ceramics, steel, paper, tyre and plywood. The number employed increased from 27,044 to 28,670. The productivity per worker rose from Rs 20,041 for the year 1969/70 to Rs 20,618 in the subsequent year.

Table II ( C ) 2 gives a summary of performance for the year 1970/71.

It will be seen from Table II (C) 2 that several public sector manufacturing enterprises recorded increases in production in 1970/71. Increases in production were recorded in the case of milk, flour, cement, minerals, paper, plywood, tyres, chemicals, steel and leather. Although the output of crockery and wall tiles declined, the output of sanitaryware and kaolin increased. The production of salt declined owing to unfavourable weather conditions. With the commissioning of the cast-iron foundry at Enderamulla, the Hardware Corporation produced for the first time cast-iron products.

During the year under review,, nine industrial enterprises achieved their production targets. Actual production fell short of the targets set for textiles, shoes, tyres, tubes and steel products.

The total sales values of public sector manufacturing enterprises reviewed here increased from Rs. 497 million in 1969/70 to Rs. 526 million in 1970/71, representing an increase of 6 per cent. Substantial increases in sales were made in the case of cement, steel and paper. On the other hand, the sale of provender, textiles and rutile declined.

Over 90 per cent capacity utilization was recorded in respect of the production of sanitaryware, chrome leather, ilmenite, caustic soda, flour and paper. Notable performances by way of utilization of capacity were also seen in manufacture of petroleum products (89%), -lubricating oils (85%), bricks and tiles (76.5%), provender (81%), and plywood (80%). Although the tyre and tube factory of the Tyre Corporation has a capacity to manufacture 250,000 tyres and tubes it must be noted that in actual fact effective capacity is much less owing to the non-availability of sufficient mould sizes. The output of Kaolin, Chlorine, rolled steel products and several items manufactured by the Hardware Corporation had to be curtailed deliberately because of market limitations.

Apart from the major activity of: manufacturing, some of the public sector manufacturing enterprises were also engaged in trade. They were the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation, the National Salt Corporation, National Textile Corporation, Ceylon Steel Corporation, Paranthan Chemicals Corporation and the Oils and Fats Corporation. On the trading accounts, in'1970/71 the highest profits were recorded by the National Textile Corporation (Rs. 2.2 million) and Eastern Paper Mills Corporation (Rs. 1.4 million). Data pertaining to the trading activities of these institutions is shown in Table II ( C ) 4

During the year under review seven industrial corporations exported their products earning Rs. 105.3 million1 in foreign exchange. Of this, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation accounted for Rs. 95.0 million. The State Flour Milling Corporation exported its by-products Bran and Pollard and earned Rs. 3.33 million in foreign exchange.

The rate of return on capital employed in production varied from .22.9 per cent in Salt, 16.4 per cent in ceramics to less than 1 per cent in the Oils and Fats and Flour Milling Corporations. The,average rate of return of all indus­trial corporations increased from 6.2 per cent to 6.8 per cent in 1970/71.

1 In addition the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation earned Rs. 1 million in foreign exchange from the export, of fish.. ... .. • ..

* INDUSTRIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

( A ) Food, Beverages and Tobacco-

fa; National Milk Board

The capital investment of the National Milk Board remained at Rs. 29.7 million in 1971. The Board's total value of production which had increased by Rs. 8.8 million to Rs. 54.7 million in 1970 is estimated to have increased to Rs. 61.4 million in 1971. The Board expects to make an estimated profit of Rs. 6.8 million in 1971 as against a profit of Rs. 1.4 million in 1970.

(b) Ceylon Oils and Fats Corporation

Provender production which increased from approximately 1,000 tons per annum in 1957 to 51,000 tons in 1969/70, declined in 1970/71 to 48,839 tons. This represents a utilization of 81.4 per cent of the capacity. On the other hand the production of fatty acids increased from 695 tons in 1969/70 to 1,057 tons in 1970/71 while the output of glycerine increased from 73 tons to 126 tons duting the same period. The Corporation earned Rs 2.7 million in foreign exchange from the export of the two latter products.

Since the Corporation is required to maintain the selling price of provender below the open market price to encourage the local poultry industry, it has been in receipt of a government grant since 1967.

The present authorised capital of the Corporation is Rs 27.6 million while the capital actually employed for production is Rs 18.4 million. In 1970/71, it made a profit of Rs 120,000/- thus giving a return of 0.7% on capital employed. For comparative purposes it may be noted that since 1969/70 the government grant has been excluded in the computation of profits.

(c) Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation

As shown in last year's Annual Report1, the Corporation continued to offset its loss on sugar from the revenue on spirits and its overall profit in 1969/70 amounted to Rs 11.1 million. Data relating to the financial year 1970/71 were not made available and hence it is not possible to review the Corporation's performance for the period.

(d) State Flour Milling Corporation

The State Flour Milling Corporation commenced commercial production in 1969. During the year 1970/71 the production of flour increased by 13 per cent to reach 48,028 tons This volume of production represents a utilization of 95.3 par cent of production capacity. There was also a corresponding increase in the production of its by-products including bran, semolina, pollard and fish meal and the value of production increased by approximately Rs. 5.5 million to Rs 36.1 million. The Corporation earned Rs 3.3 million in foreign exchange, by exporting 8,107 tons of bran and pollard during the first

1 Annual Report 1970, page 67.

( 61 )

9 months of 1971. Profits before taxation declined from Rs. 235,000 in 1969/70 to Rs. 162,000 in 1970/71. The capital employed in production was Rs. 26.5 million; the rate of return in 1970/71 was 0.61 per cent.

(e) National Salt Corporation

Due to unfavourable weather conditions salt production declined sharply by 46,478 tons or 42 per cent to 63,354 tons in 1970/71 over the previous .year. The Corporation has been steadily building up stocks and was able to meet the domestic demand by drawing down these stocks.

The Corporation made a profit of Rs. 2.3 million in 1970/71 as against Rs. 2.8 million in 1969/70, representing a rate of return of 22.9 per cent compared to 28.1 per cent in the previous year. In spite of an increase in sales, the lower prof it in 1970/7 lwas mainly due to an increase in the wage bill. Meanwhile the trend in the first two quartets of 1971/72 indicates a shortfall in production targets for that year.

(B) Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather Industries

(a) National Textiles Corporation

The total capital investment of the Corporation increased by Rs. 48.4 million to Rs. 282.3 million in 1970/71. Of this, Rs. 47.1 million was invested in the new textile mill at Thulhiriya, but this mill did not come into commercial production in 1970/71. The Corporation's production of yam and textiles was lower in 1970/71 compared with the previous year. Meanwhile the trend in the first two quarters indicates that the production in 1971/72 is likely to be higher than in the previous year.

In spite of the increase in turnover the Corporation suffered a loss of Rs. 0.07 million compared with an; overall profit of Rs. 2.8 million in 1969770 on manufacturing activities. This was largely due to the higher wage costs. The fall in output at Veyangoda resulted in larger losses; increased profits from the sale of imported yarn offset a part of the loss. In 1971/72 the Corporation will not have this advantage since the yarn import section has been transferred to the State Weaving Supplies Corporation.

(b) Ceylon Leather Products Corporation

The total investment of this Corporation increased in 1970/71 by Rs. 4.1 million to Rs. 14.9 million on account of the construction of a new Tannery which nearly doubled the production capacity of chrome leather. The output of all products except shoes recorded increases in 1970/71. The Corporation's shoe factory worked at 66 per cent of its capacity mainly on account ot production being geared to internal market demand and the accumulation of large stocks in 1970. There were no exports of shoes and leather products in 1970/71; in fact export values declined sharply frcm Rs. 7843 thousand in 1968/69 to Rs. 33.3 thousand in 1969/70..

Though value of production in 1970/71 was 81% of that in the previous year, sales increased by 6% because of the vigorous sales promotion campaign adopted to dispose of the accumulated stocks. The Corporation expects to

( 62 )

enhance its production and sales substantially in 1971/72. The production trends in the first two quarters of the year, however, indicate shortfalls in respect of all products.

This Corporation which recorded a profit equivalent to Rs. 168 thousand (or 2.7% of its capital) in 1968/69, incurred a loss in the following. year, in 1970/71 the loss multiplied by more than five times the previous years loss. Employment increased from 690 in 1969/70 to 864 persons during this year. The use of local materials, increased from 38% in 1967/68 to 69.4% in 1970/71.

( C ) W o o d and W o o d Products

(a) Ceylon Plywoods Corporation

The Gintota Factory with an annual production capacity of 30 million sq. ft of 3-ply plywood produced 24 million sq.ft by working three shifts in 1970/71. This represents approximately 80 per cent utilization of capacity. Production of tea chests increased from 902,000 in 1969/70 to 1,043,000 in 1970/71. The manufacture of ply boards, flush doors and block boards also increased and the value of production at Rs. 11.4 million in 1970/71 was the highest since the inception of the Corporation. Despite this and a Rs. 3 million increase in sales, profits declined from Rs. 0.6 million in 1969/70 to Rs. 0.1 million in 1970/71. The fall in profits is attributed to the increase in the contributions made to the Employees' Provident Fund from 6 per cent to 15 per cent and the introduction of a revised wage structure for the Corporation employees.The number employed increased from 1199 in.1969/70 to 1226 in 1970/71.

In 1970/71 the Corporation exported 370.5592 cu. metres of ply boards and earned Rs. 312,500 in foreign exchange. Upto 31st March, 1971 the.capital employed in production was Rs. 7.05 million; it had a rate of return of 1.5.7% as against 9.8% in the previous year.

(b) State Timber Corporation

The State TimbeT Corportion was constituted in 1968 primarily to undertake extraction, sawing and sale of timber, and the establishment of mechanised units for timber extraction. The Corporation took over all the contracts for timber extraction entered into by the Conservator of Forests with private contractors, all equipment used by the Forest Department for extracting timber, saw mills, timber sales depots etc.

The data on actual performance for 1970/71 and the budgeted figures for 1971/72 were not made available.

(D) Paper and Paper Products, Printing and Publishing

(a) Eastern Paper Mills Corporation

In 1970/71 the production of paper was higher than in the previous year on account of the utilization of increased capacity of the plant at Valaichchenai. Meanwhile, paper imports recorded a fall due to import curtailment and availa-bility of surplus stocks. The value of sales of manufactured and imported paper

( 63 )

was higher in 1970/71 but the profits recorded a marginal fall owing to the increased wage bill. In 1971/72 the Corporation has budgeted for a higher out­put. However, the production trend observed during the first two quarters; of the year indicates that production might fall short of the estimated target.

Total investment of the Corporation increased by Rs. 20 million to Rs. 83-9 million in 1970/71. This increase is accounted for by ?the investment made on the Paper Board Mill at Valaichchenai. The rate of return on capital employed in production was 9.3 per cent. • , -

(b) State Printing Corporation . '

In 1970/71, machinery to the value of Rs. 2.8 million was transferred from the Government Press as contribution towards the capital of the Corporation. The total investment rose by Rs. 3.4 million to Rs. 10.8 million in 1970/71. The Corporation commenced commercial production in October 1970.. Over the first six months of production the Corporation incurred a loss of Rs. 692,837..

(E) Chemicals, Petroleum, Rubber and Plastic Products

(a) Paranthan Chemicals Corporation

The downward trend in the production of Caustic Soda since 1966/67 was arrested in 1970/71, when output increased by 62 per cent oyer the previous year to reach 1,375 tons representing about 90 per cent of the total capacity. The manufacture of Chlorine also increased from 505 tons in 1969/70 to 576 tons in 1970/71. The Corporation commenced production of Calcium Chloride during the year under review. Hydrochloric acid which was produced previously on an experimental basis was produced commercially. Total production of 192 tons of this product was sufficient to meet the requirements of the country.

The value of production increased from Rs. 2.8 million to Rs. 3.1 million in 1970/71 and the value of sales increased by approximately Rs. 701,000. Profits of the Corporation increased from Rs. 240,027 in 1969/70 to Rs. 648,054 in 1970/71 and the return on capital employed in production was 5.5 per cent. . .

The steep rise in .the prices of imported Caustic Soda from £ 28 to £ 60 per ton compelled the Corporation to increase the selling price of Caustic Soda solid and Caustic Soda flakes at Rs. 1,600 and Rs. 1,700 per ton respectively.

(b) Ceylon Tyre Corporation

Since the commencement of commercial production in . 1967, the Corpo­ration has progressively increased its output and its commercial profitability. Production of tyres increased from 57,622 in 1967/68 the first year of manufacture to 84,342 in 1970/71 while the production of tubes increased from 62,062 to 99, 325 over the same period. However, the production of tyres and tubes in the year under review fell far short of the targets. Capacity utilization continued to be low - 33.6 per cent for tyres and 65.3 per cent for tubes- This low utilization

( 64 )

o f capacity was due to the fact that the Corporation had moulds to manufacture only a limited range of tyre sizes which were confined to 11 in 1970/71 as against 6 in the previous year-

The value of overall production increased from Rs. 11.3 million in 1967/68 to Rs. 43.5 million in 1970/71. Profits before tax amount to Rs. 6.2 million in the year under review and represents an increase of 15 per cent over that of the previous year. The increase in commercial profitability was achieved without any upward revision in selling prices. During the year the return on invested capital of Rs. 67.5 million was 9 per cent.

(c) Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

Oil Refinery

The total outlay on the Oil Refinery stood at Rs. 186 million in 1971. Production at the refinery declined from 1.7 million metric tons to 1.4 million metric tons in 1971. The manufacture of premium motor gasoline was suspended in January and February 1971 for maintenance work. The production of bitumen was curtailed from 1971 onwards due to the very low off-take. More­over production at the refinery was also affected by a strike which lasted 2 weeks.

In 1971 the refinery exported naphtha, fuel oil and bunkers worth approxi­mately Rs. 8.4 million in foreign exchange.

The profit and loss figures on the operation of the refinery were not available.

Lubrication Oil Blending Plant

The total capital investment in this plant remained at Rs. 5.5 million in 1970.

The Blending Plant with a production capacity of 4.5 million gallons, produced 3.8 million gallons of lubricating oils in 1971 at a profit of Rs. 47 million as against Rs. 3. 2 million in the previous year. The return on capital on the Blending Plant was 58 per cent in 1970 and 86 psr cent in 1971.

(d) Ceylon Ayurvedic Dtugs Corporation

This Corporation which was established in 1969 took over the functions of the Ayurvedic Drugs Manufacturing unit of the Small Industries Corporation in July 1969. Capital investment in 1970/71 remained at Rs. 1.4 million. The value of production increased from Rs. 1.1 million in 1969/70 to Rs. 1.2 million during the year under review. In 1970/71 the Corporation made* a profit of Rs. 133,000 as against Rs. 130,000 in the previous year. The rate of return on capital was 97 per cent in 1970/71

(f) State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation

This Corporation which was eatablished in 1966 is expected to set up a Plant for the manufacture of urea with a capacity to produce 864 tons per day. The main raw material for production would be naphtha, a by-product of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery, presently exported. The Plant is expected to be commissioned in 1975.

( 65 )

The authorised capital of the Corporation as on 31 st March 1971, stood at Rs. 346 million and total capital contributed by the Government was Rs 49.5 million. The actual expenditure incurred on the development of the factory site etc. was Rs 9.7 million.

(F) Non-Metallic Mineral Products (except Petroleum Products).

(a) Ceylon Ceramics Corporation

During the year 1970/71, the Negombo and Boralesgamuwa factories and sanitary ware section of the Piliyandala factory exceeded their production targets by approximately 8 per cent. In fact, the sanitaryware section recorded a production of 543 tons which is slightly above capacity. Production at the Kaolin Refinery though higher than in the previous year was 28 per cent below capacity because of market limitations. On the other hand, the crockery and wall-tile sections of the Piliyandala factory fell below their targets by 13 per cent and 19 per cent respectively. This could be mainly attributed to the closure of the kilns for major repairs.

The Ceramics Corporation was able to earn an increased profit of Rs 3.3 million during the year 1970/71, due to a substantial increase in the value of sales from Rs 12.9 million in 1969/70 to Rs 16.1 million in 1970/71.

The pricing policy adopted by the Corporation is to obtain profits through a large turnover rather than through higher prices. The everyday utility articles are priced low and the 'sophisticated' articles are priced high. Qn an average, the margin of profit on sales for crockery is about 15 per cent, sanitaryware 15 per cent, wall-tiles - 29 per cent and kaolin - 3 per cent. The Corporation was able to earn Rs 85,823 in foreign exchange from the export of nearly 500,000 four inch tea saucers.

The Corporation which has been continuously making profits since 1960, showed a return of 16% on the capital employed which amounted to Rs 19.9 million.

(b) Ceylon Cement Corporation

The total investment of the Corporation increased by Rs 58.4 million to Rs 244.1 million in 1970/71. The first stage of the Puttalam Cement factory commenced production during the year under review. The total. production of cement has increased from 268,338 tons in 1969/70 to 350,816 tons in 1970/71 while the output of clinker at Kankesanthurai recorded a slight fall. However in spite of a higher turnover, the corporation's profit declined marginally in 1970/71 and the return on capital was 12.9 per cent. In 1971/72 the corporation anticipates a substantial increase in its profit on estimated higher levels of production and sales. The trend in first three quarters indicates that production is likely to be higher than in the previous year.

The first stage of the Puttalam factory which recorded a profit of Rs 4 million in 1970/71 expects to increase its profits by more than threefold in 1971/72-

( 66 )

(c) National Small Industries Corporation

The total capital investment of this corporation has increased by Rs. 1.27 million to Rs 26.13 million in 1970/71. The entire increase in investment has been utilised in the brick and tile factory. Meanwhile, the corporation entered the field of beedi manufacture during the year under review. Also, import and distribution of beedi leaves and the marketing of finished product are undertaken by the Corporation.

The value of production has increased by Rs 1.6 million from Rs 8.03 million in 1969/70 to Rs 9.67 million in 1970/71. However, in spite of a marginal increase in the value of sales, the corporation's loss has increased considerably. The carpentry section has been incurring recurring losses due to the unrealistic prices on intra-governmental sales. In 1971/72, the loss is expected to be higher especially in the case of the carpentry section.The actual performance observed in the first quarter indicates that production and sales are proceeding slightly below targets.

(d) Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation

The capital investment of this Corporation has increased by Rs 1 million to Rs 16.22 million in 1970/71. Generally, there was an all round increase in production at this Corporation. The production of Ilmenite increased by 15,000 tons or 19 per cent over the previous year and this represented a capacity utilization of approximately 95 per cent. Meanwhile the Corporation produced 121 tons of commercial grade Zircon for the first time during the year. The export of Ilmenite rose appreciably and in 1971/72 it is expected to rise further. On the basis of production trends observed during the first six months of the year it is very likely that production targets would be maintained.

On acount of higher output and sales the Corporation increased Its profits

from Rs 1.5 million in 1969170 to Rs 1.6 million in 1970/71 representing a return

of 10 per cent on capital employed in production.

(G) Basic Metal Industries

(a) Ceylon Steel Corporation

The Corporation's output in 1970/71 of rolled sections and wire products showed a modest increase and its sales recorded only a marginal increase. Meanwhile, latest available information indicates that production and sales are proceeding much below targets.

The Steel Rolling Mill and the Wire Mill continued to work below capacity. In spite of an increase in prices the Corporation was unable to maintain its previous year's profit level owing to increased costs incurred by the Corporation on acount of a rise in prices of imported material. In 1970/71 profit was Rs 1,434 million compared with Rs 2,187 million in the previous year and the return on capital was 1.2 per cent.

( 67 )

(H) Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Epuipment

(a) State Hardware Corporation

The value of production of the Corporation has increased by Rs 1.4 million to Rs 5.2 million in 1970/71. Its sales, however, were below the previous year's level owing to strong competition from the private sector. Meanwhile it anticipates to more than quadruple its sales value in 1971/72. On the basis of observe! performance in early 1971/72, it is very unlikely that these sales targets could be maintained. Nevertheless, its sales value in the first quarter in 1971/72 was much higher than that of the corresponding period in the previous year.

During the first six months of the year under review the Corporation incurred a loss of Rs 3.5 million indicating that the loss in this year might be higher than in the previous year.

4. OTHER PUBLIC ENTERPRISES

(A) Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing

(a) Ceylon Fisheries Corporation

In 1970/71 the total investment of the Corporation increased from Rs 84.1 million to Rs 107.0 million representing an increase of 27 per cent. The quantity of fish caught increased from 4-4 million lbs to 5.7 million lbs. and the quantity of fish purchased from 1.7 million lbs to 4-5 million lbs. Over the last few years the Corporation has been incurring recurring losses. The loss in 1969/70 was Rs 11.8 million. The result for 1970/71 has not been assessed.

In 1970/71 the Corporation exported 363,948 lbs. of fish worth Rs 1.0 million in foreign exchange as against 414,848 lbs. in 1969/70 worth Rs 0.6 million in foreign exchange.

(b) Ceylon State Plantations Corporation

The Ceylon State Plantations Corporation managed 13 plantations and 4 factories during the year 1969/70.

Capital investment in the Corporation increased from Rs 33.5 million in 1965/66 to Rs 39.2 million in 1966/67; it declined to Rs 32.0 million in 1967/68 and again increased to Rs 36.3 million in 1968/69. In 1969/70 capital investment stood at Rs 38.4 million of which Rs 31.4 million was on plantations and Rs 7 million was on factories. Total capital investment according to estimates for 1970/71 increased to Rs 40.9 million. •,

The revenue from the operation of plantations declined marginally from Rs 4-7 million in 1968/69 to Rs 44 million in 1969/70 and the profits have increased from Rs 12,000 to Rs 30,000. Profits in 1970/71 are estimated to be Rs 548,000. On the other hand the Corporation's losses incurred on the management of factories increased from Rs 109,000 in 1968/69 to Rs 145,000 in 1969/70. The losses are estimated to have declined to Rs 36,000 in 1970/71.

(B) Transport, Storage and Communications

(a) Ceylon Government Railway-

The total investment at the end of the financial year 1969/70 of Rs. 687.5 million is estimated to have increased by approximately Rs. 1.7 million to Rs. 689.2 million at the end of 1970/71.

The number of passengers carried is estimated to have decreased from app­roximately 85 million in 1969/70 to 83 million in 1970/71. Passenger mileage during the year under review however, shows a greater increase than in the previous year. Passenger receipts are estimated to have declined to Rs. 44-6 million from Rs. 60.3 million in 1969/70.

Despite the competition from road transport the volume of goods traffic has shown a marginal increase of 0.1 million tons. Total revenue from goods trans­port increased by Rs, 46 million although ton-mileage of goods declined by 22 4 million-

( 69 )

Total estimated revenue of the railway increased by Rs. 1.8 million while the estimated increase in expenditure was Rs. 3.0 million. The greater increase'in expenditure offset the smaller increase in revenue and the overall loss is estimated to have reached the 1968/69 peak of Rs.. 57.4 million. , >

(b) Ceylon Transport Board-Certain salient features of the Board's operations during the five years end­ing 1970/71 are shown in Table II (C) 8.

Total capital investment by the Board increased by Rs. 56.1 million to Rs. 376.5 million in 1970/71. Of this increase Rs. 42.4 million was in respect of vehicles, while the balance of Rs. 13.7 million was on depot expansion.

The vehicles fleet owned by the Board increased by 489 to 6,412 in 1970/71. The operational stock of buses increased by 191 and the effective available stock by 166.

In 1970/71 the scheduled mileage increased by 26.1 million miles while the operated mileage increased by 2.7 million miles. Lost mileage caused by break - downs and non-availability of crews ' at the required . times increased to 62.6 million miles as against 42.8 million miles in 1969/70. Dead mileage due to empty travel of buses from garages to starting points etc., was reduced slightly.

Employment at the Board continued to increase and in 1970/71 the total work force was 47,792 or 6,960 more than in the previous year. This increase in employment is more than 14 times the increase in the number of buses. In 1966/67, the number of employees per bus on available effective fleet was on an average 8.2 and in 1970/71 was 10,2.

The Board's revenue increased by Rs. 18-2 million to Rs. 306.2 million and expenditure increased by Rs. 47.3 million to Rs. 369.4 million in 1970/71. The greater increase in expenditure offset the increase in revenue and resulted in the Board operating at a loss of Rs. 63.2 million in 1970/71 as against a loss of Rs. 34.2 million in the previous year. In June, 1971, the Board put up the fares in all sectors.

(c) Colombo Port Commission-In September 1971 the estimated capital investment by the Port Commission on the basis of a 1955 valuation of assets amounted to Rs. 343.8 million. With the development work in the current year, it is expected to increase to Rs, 380-9 million. A substantial portion of this investment has been in the Port of Colombo.

Revenue which has shown an upward trend sinee 1967/68 increased to Rs. 50.6 million in 1970/71. Owing to the increased maintenance cost resulting from higher cost of material, the payment of higher wages and overtime to employees on consolidated salaries and increased cost oi three meals supplied to port workers, working expenditure which has been increasing over the years rose to Rs. 30.6 million in 1970/71. The increase in revenue offset the increase in expenditure and the Port Commission has recorded an overall surplus of Rs 3 million in 1970/71 as against a deficit of" Rs. 4.4 million in the previous yeari"

(d) Port Cargo Corporation-

Certain salient aspects on the operations of the Corporation during the last five financial years (August to July) are shown in Table II (C).8

The capital investment of the Corporation at the end of July 1971 was Rs. 54.3 million, representing an increase of Rs. 0.7 million over the previous year. This increase was in respect of the Trincomalee Port.

The tonnage of cargo handled by the Corporation which declined from 3.5 million tons in 1968/69 to 3.1 million tons in 1969/70 is estimated to have fallen to 2.9 million tons in 1970/71. This was primarily due to the decline in the cargo handled at the Ports of Colombo and Trincomalee.

A Rs. 4-2 million reduction in revenue and a Rs. 7.4 million increase in expenditure primarily due to the increase in the wage bill resulted in the Cor­poration recording an estimated loss of Rs. 10.1 million on its operations in 1970/71 as compared with a profit of Rs. 1.5 million in the previous year.

(e) Port Tally and Protective Services Corporation-

The capital investment by the Corporation as at end of 1970/71 remained at Rs. 459,869. Total expenditure increased by Rs. 0.3 million to Rs. 7.0 million in 1970/71 while the total income of the Corporation from services rendered declined by Rs. 0.9 million to Rs. 5.3 million. The increase in expenditure nad fall in income resulted in the Corporation increasing its loss (before tax and FEECs) by Rs. 1.2 million to Rs 1.7 million in 1970/71.

(f) Postal and Telecommunication Services-

Capital expenditure increased from Rs. 130.6 million in 1968/69 toRs. 141.1

million in 1969/70. The increase in capital expenditure was mainly for the ex­pansion of the Post and Telecommunication Services. The expenditure on postal services increased by Rs. 6.5 million in 1969/70 primarily on account of wage increases, while income increased by Rs. 0.5 million. A small increase in income was offset by the greater increase in expenditure and consequently the deficit of Rs. 2.5 million from postal services as against a surplus in the previous year. In the case of telegraphic services the increased income resulting from the increase in rates and the share of revenue from collections on telephones and overseas tele­communication services offset a small increase in expenditure and the overall loss fell to Rs. 1.7 million in 1969/70 from Rs. 2.2 million in the previous year.

The increased income from telephone services in 1969/70 resulting from the increase in the licence fees and rates set off a small increase in expenditure and the overall deficit has been reduced to Rs 308,000 from Rs. 641,000 in 1968/69.

The commercial accounts of the department have shown an overall loss of Rs. 4.5 million in 1969/70 as against a profit of Rs. 0,6 million in 1968/69 and a loss of Rs. 0.3 million in 1967/68.

( 74 )

( C ) Wholesale and Retail Trade

(a) Co-operative Wholesale Establishment-

The working capital which has increased steadily until 1969, has recorded a fall of Rs. 34.4 million in 1970. Of this fall, Rs. 18.7 million was accounted for by its contribution to the consolidated fund. Sales were almost static but total expenditure was higher than in the previous year. The C. W. E. made a profit of Rs. 17.2 million in 1970 as against a profit of Rs. 26.8 million in 1969. The drop in profits is attributed to the Food Commissioner taking over the wholesale distribution of sugar.

Final data in respect of employment are not available. Certain basic statis­tics relating to the C.W.E. for five years ending 1971 are given in Table II (C).9

(b) Ceylon Petroleum Corporation-

Since the end of 1969 the Corporation shifted from the import of refined petroleum products to purchases from its own Refinery and Blending Plant. The total income which has risen steadily over the years stood at Rs. 406.4 million in 1970. Increase in sales income was much higher in 1970 than the corresponding increase in the previous year despite a decrease in the quantity of oil sold.

Net trading profit has increased progressively in recent years and the in­crease in 1970 was Rs. 6.4 million or 2 per cent over the previous year. Mean­while a sharp increase of 60 per cent in profits is anticipated in 1970 on account

of higher sales.

Sale of auto diesel and kerosine recorded an increase while sale of industrial diesel and furnace oil showed a decline.

The Corporation took over the bunkering operations from January, 1971. The take over of aviation refueling was made possible by the fact that the Refi­nery commenced production of aviation turbine fuel in mid 1971.

(c) Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation-

The imports of raw material and the mixing of fertilizer by the Corporation increased progressively over the years. In 1970/71, the imports showed a further increase of 44,497 tons or 22 per cent over the previous year. This is attributed to the increased consumption of fertilizer under the governments agricultural development programme. The total turnover too recorded a corresponding increase but the profit declined from Rs. 10.63 million in 1969/70 to Rs. 9.07 million in 1970/71 owing to the increase in import prices from the second half

of 1970.

Although a substantial rise in the sales revenue is anticipated in 1971/72, the profit is estimated to rise only marginally. In 1970/71, employment has recorded a considerable increase due to the expansion of trading activities of this corporation

(b) Colombo District (Low-lying) Reclamation Board-

The capital investment which has shown an increase of Rs 1.39 million to Rs 4-25 million is estimated to show a more than two-fold increase in 1971/72. Acreage of land reclaimed declined from 13.3 acres in 1969/70 to 10.5 acres in 1970/71. Reduction in area reclaimed was due to breakdown of the Dredger belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (contractor to the Board). The Board did not sell any lands reclaimed during the period 1969/70-1970/71.

(E) Electricity, Gas and Water-

fa) Ceylon Electricity Board-

The Ceylon Electricity Board was established on 1st November, 1969 and the year 1970 was the first full year of its operations. Data on the operations

of the Board in 1969/70 (1st October 1969 to 31st December, 1970) along with comparable data pertaining to the former Department of Government Electrical Undertakings are shown in Table IIC 11.

Capital investment increased from Rs 741-9 million in 1968/69 to Rs 867.9 million at the end of December 1970. Total expenditure incurred during the fifteen months period ending December 1970 was Rs 94.6 million while expenditure in the financial year 1968/69 (October-September) was Rs 72.4 million. The significant increase in expenditure during the period under review could be attributed to the provision of Rs 17.2 million for depreciation included in overhead expenditure. 1 Total revenue during the same period increased to Rs 122.2 million, largely, on account of increased earnings from Electricity sales. The Board earned a profit of Rs 28.3 million during the 15 months period ending December 1970, while the profit from Operations in 1968/69 (12 month period) was Rs 9.2 million.

The Board's financial year is now the calendar year. Data relating to

1971 were not made available.

In 1970, the Corporation improved its performance over the. previous year. The number and value of life insurance policies issued and outstanding increased progressively in recent years, although the increase in 1970 was slower than in the preceding year. Premium income has recorded a steady increase and the amount in the Life Assurance Fund at the end of 1970 was Rs 168.8 million as against Rs 127.8 million in 1969. In 1970 the ratio of expense to income has shown a marginal decline of 0.4 per cent from 31.6 per cent in 1969 to 31.2 per cent in 1970.

In 1970 the Corporation enhanced its profits from Fire Insurance and Marine Insurance. However, the premium income from these activities declined. Meanwhile the Corporation incurred a loss of Rs 1.9 million in 1970 from General

Accident Insurance as against a profit of Rs 1.9 million in the previous year.
