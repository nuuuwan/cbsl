The increase in the money supply in the year was in fact less than the increase in the net external banking assets which amounted to Rs. 200.5 million and which was the highest increase recorded since 1955. The lower increase in money supply was due to the contractionary influence exerted by the operations of the domestic sectors (the Government and the private sector) taken together. While the Government's operations with the banking system resulted in an expansion of Rs. 54.1 million, it was more than offset by the contractionary influence of Rs. 76.2 million emanating from the operations of the private sector.",

The pressure on prices appears however to have been abated to some extent by a decline in the velocity of circulation of money. The only available indicator of the change in the velocity is the rate of turnover of demand deposits held by the public, the monthly average of which fell by 12.6 per cent in 1971.",

The balance of payments on current account, however, showed a deficit of Rs. 303.7 million. There was in addition a deficit of Rs. 4.7 million in private capital movements, while official capital repayments amounted toRs. 96.2 million. If the entire deficit on these transactions were financed by the banking system a contractionary effect on the money supply of Rs. 404.6 million would have resulted. This potential contractionary influence was however much more than offset by the Government's receipts of foreign aid amounting to Rs. 570.8 million and a net increase of Rs. 33.0 million in short-term credit. The net expansionary effect of the external sector on the money supply was therefore Rs. 200.5 million, which stands in marked contrast to the contraction of Rs. 1.5 million in 1970.",

The international reserve of the Central Bank rose by Rs. 44.2 million, reflecting an increase of Rs. 37.9 million in cash and balances abroad and an increase of Rs. 6.4 million in the holdings of foreign government securities, the latter arising wholly on account of revaluation. The external assets of the commercial banks also rose by Rs. 34.7 million. The external liabilities of the Central Bank declined by Rs. 128.0 million. Purchases from the International Monetary Fund in 1971 amounted to Rs. 83.4 million, while repurchases were Rs. 139.2 million; thus the balances of the I.M.F. with the Central Bank, allowing also for the payment of service charges, declined by Rs. 41.0 million. The Central Bank's borrowings from banks and other institu\u00adtions abroad were also reduced by Rs. 77.7 million. The external liabilities of the commercial banks, on the other hand, rose by Rs. 6.5 million, resulting in a net reduction of Rs. 121.5 million in the external liabilties of the banking system.",

Thus, the government's debt to the Central Bank rose in 1971 by Rs. 41.3 million which was less than a third of the increase in the previous year. The increase in commercial bank credit to the Government of Rs. 49.3 million too was much lower than the increase of Rs. 194.1 million in 1970. The increase in commercial bank credit in 1971 consisted of increases of Rs. 39.4 million in treasury bills, Rs. 11.3 million in government and govern\u00adment guaranteed securities, and Rs. 2.4 million in government import bills, offset slightly by a decrease of Rs. 3.5 million in short-term credit to the Government in the form of cheques etc., purchased on government account. The Government also drew its cash balances down by Rs. 68.0 million in 1971 in contrast to an accumulation of Rs. 124-2 million in the previous year. The total expansionary effect of Rs. 158.6 million thus created by the increase in credit to the Government from the banking system and by the drawing down of the Government's cash balances was offset substantially by an increase of Rs. 104-5 million in 'other liabilities and accounts (net)' of the Central Bank, so that the net expansionary effect on the money supply attributable to the government sector was Rs. 54-1 million.",

    "text": "To summarise, the growth in the money supply and the factors affecting it are reminiscent of the pattern which prevailed in the early fifties where the money supply tended to rise sharply, primarily under the influence of the external sector. The much smaller recourse to the banking system by the Government was also a salient feature in 1971. The larger volume of non-bank market borrowings arising mainly as a consequence of the demonetisation exercise of October 1970 and the increase in foreign finance, were the major factors contributing to the reduction in the Government's reliance on the banking system. The negative impact on the money supply of the operations of the private sector (including public corporations and the co-operatives) is indicative of the considerable slack in the activities of that sector. The slack in the private sector proper may be attributed to such factors as the foreign exchange constraint, the encroachment into its field in the year by the public corporations and perhaps the uncertainty arising from the potential expansion of the corporation sector. The public corporations, while admittedly being themselves subject to the foreign exchange constraint, were not fully geared to fill the void created by the reduced role of the private sector proper. Other factors, like the insurgency, would also have affected the activities of the private sector as awhole. The economy thus grew at only 0.9 per cent in the year and viewed against this rate of growth, the expansion of 9.3 per cent in the money supply was significantly high.",

In 1971, however, the earlier trend had mani\u00adfested itself again as seen from the fact that currency as ratio of money supply rose more or less steadily from 47.6 per cent at the end of 1970 to 51.9 per cent at the end of 1971. It is indeed disconcerting that as much as Rs. 180.8 million of the Rs. 183.1 million increase in the money supply in 1971 should have taken the form of currency. Apart from the usual factors influencing the currency holdings of the public, it may also have been due to the operation of the Bank Debits tax since October 1970. The insignificant increase in demand deposits was also accompanied by a decline of 12.6 per cent in the average monthly turn\u00adover rate of these deposits, which might serve to emphasise the influence of the Bank Debits tax.",

    "text": "Table 11 (D) 6 shows that the change in demand deposits in 1971 was characterised by an increase in the deposits of the business sector, offset partly by a decrease in the deposits of the non-business sector. In the business sector, demand deposits of manufacturing establishments rose substantially by Rs. 39.7 million, following an increase of Rs. 26.6 million in 1970; their share in total deposits also rose from 10.0 per cent at the end of 1970 to 13.9 per cent at the end of 1971. Demand deposits of trading institutions, on the other hand, registered a pronounced decline of Rs. 38.6 million in contrast to an increase of Rs. 76.6 million in 1970; their share in total deposits consequently fell from 18.8 percent at the end of 1970 to 14.8 per cent at the end of 1971. Demand deposits of financial institutions and 'other business* rose by Rs. 2.9 million and Rs 9.1 million respectively, compared with increases of Rs. 14.2 million and Rs. 25.5 million in the previous year. Demand deposits of plantations, which fell by Rs. 6.7 million in 1970, rose by Rs. 4.4 million in 1971. Demand deposits of local authorities also registered a substantial increase of Rs. 14.5 million asjcompared with an increase of Rs. 1.1 million in 1970, while those of individuals and non-business institutions fell by Rs. 22.3 million and Rs. 0.9 million respectively. The decline in the deposits of individuals is in marked contrast to the previous yeaT when they rose by Rs. 747 million; their share in total demand deposits fell from 41-0 per cent at the end of 1970 to 38.4 per cent at the end of 1971.",

The increase of Rs. 12.5 million in time deposits compares with an increase of Rs. 10,5 million in 1970. Savings deposits with commercial banks, which recorded a very sharp increase of Rs. 164.1 million in 1970 mainly as a consequence of the demonetisation, rose by Rs.78.8 million in 1971. The most pronounced increase in time deposits with commercial banks in 1971 was in those of individuals. These deposits rose by Rs. 27.8 million, compared with increases of Rs. 112 million in 1970 and Rs. 0.6 million in 1969. Time deposits of 'other business* establishments also showed a substantial increase of Rs. 18.6 million, while those of trading institutions rose by Rs. 7.6 million.

    "text": "A notable feature in the growth of secondary liquid assets in 1971 was the substantial increase in the deposits with the Ceylon Savings Bank, These deposits were growing very slowly until 1970, the increase in any year not exceeding Rs. 10 million the most; the increase in 1971 amounted to Rs. 75.1million. The relatively insignificant increase in the deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank in 1971, despite the substantially higher rate of interest paid on them with effect from January 1971,.is probably indicative of the depositors' preference of the liquidity of deposits to their yield. The unprecedented increase of nearly Rs. 104 million in deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank in 1970 as a con\u00adsequence of the demonetisation arose from the fact that the Bank had a much wider geographical coverage than the commercial banks and the Ceylon Savings Bank. The rate of interest payable on the Bank's deposits was doubled from 3.6 per cent to 7-2 per cent in January 1971. (The rate paid by the Ceylon Savings Bank",

The substantially higher rate of interest paid in 1971 had not resulted in a significant increase in the volume of deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank, though it may have helped the Bank to retain the deposits which accrued during the demonetisation exercise. The commercial banks, on the other hand, were paying only 4$ per cent on savings deposits in 1971 but were able to achieve a substantial increase in savings deposits, amounting to Rs. 80 million as compared with an increase of only about Rs. 14 million with the Post Office Savings Bank. The poor performance of the Bank may thus be attributable to the lesser liquidity of its deposits arising from the more rigid withdrawal formalities. While depositors have thus shown a pre\u00adference for liquidity to yield, they also seem to have taken advantage of the higher yield as seen in the substantial increase in the deposits with the Ceylon Savings Bank, where withdrawal formalities are less rigid. The increase in de\u00adposits with the Ceylon Savings Bank would probably have been much more but for its limited geographical coverage. These facts serve to emphasise that higher interest rates by themselves cannot contribute much to the mobilisation of savings; the liquidity of deposits seem to have a greater influence on depositors. The value of savings certificates held by the public continues to decline, probably due to the fact that the rate paid on these certificates has not been revised yet in line with the rates payable on the Post Office Savings Bank and the Ceylon Savings Bank deposits.",

In 1970, the total hol\u00addings of treasury bills, tax reserve certificates and government bonds rose by Rs. 111,8 million, as compared with an increase of Rs. 58.9 million in 1969. In 1971, the increase in the total holdings amounted to Rs. 134-7 million; the inc\u00adrease in the treasury bill holdings was negligible at Rs. 0.6 million, while holdings of government bonds and tax reserve certificates rose by Rs. 124.5 million and Rs. 9.6 million respectively. The increase of Rs. 124.5 million in government bonds compares with an increase of Rs. 86.8 million in 1970. The Insurance Corporation, whose holdings of government bonds increased by Rs. 65.1 million, accounted for more than half the increase in the total value of government bonds hsld by the private sector; the increase in the holdings of the Corporation in 1970 amounted to Rs. 45.9 million. Trusts, benevolent, pension and provident funds (other than the Employees' Provident Fund) increased their holdings of govern\u00adment bonds by Rs. 60.1 million, as compared with Rs. 38.2 million in 1970.

    "text": "2. (a) Commercial Banking - Principal Trends In the year under review, almost the entire increase in the money supply took the form of currency impairing thereby the possible accrual of resources to the commercial banks through a growth in demand deposits. The growth in time and savings deposits was also lower than in the previous year but it must be noted that the increase in these deposits in 1970 was unusually large because of the demonetisation. The slower growth in deposits, however, did not affect the banks because demands on their resources were not heavy during the year. This is indicated by the higher ratio of liquid assets to total deposits; the monthly average ratio was 36.0 per cent as against 30.8 per cent in 1970. Cash as ratio of total deposits was also higher at 15.0 per cent as against 12.7 per cent in the previous year. The commercial banks' reliance on resources from the Central Bank was also on average lower than in 1970.",

In 1970, government corporations had increased their utilisation of banks' resources to the extent of Rs. 43.1 million by way of advances but had provided the banks with a slightly higher level of resources in the form of an increase of Rs. 44.7 million in deposits. The rest of the private sector, while increasing their utilisation of banks' resources by Rs. 84.1 million in the form of advances in 1971, contributed Rs. 98.8 million to the increase in the banks' resources in the form of an increase in deposits. The net flow of resour\u00adces from the rest of the private sector to the banks thus amounted to Rs. 14.7 million, as compared with a flow in the previous year of Rs. 363.4 million con\u00adsisting of an increase of Rs. 341.9 million in deposits and a decrease of Rs. 21.5 million in advances and investments.",

    "text": "A striking feature of the changes in the structure of bank advances in 1971 was the declining share of the advances for industrial and agricultural purposes in the total advances. Advances for industrial purposes have been increasing rapidly in the years up to 1970; the increases in 1968 and 1969 amounted to Rs. 112.6 million and Rs. 155.6 million respectively. These advances, which accounted for only 12.2 per cent of total advances at the end of 1967 rose sharply to 25.6 per cent at the end of 1969. The rate of increase in these advances slackened considerably in 1970, when the increase amounted to Rs. 28.7 million and the share in total advances was 26.9 per cent. In 1971, though the increase in absolute terms was somewhat higher at Rs. 37.1 million, the share of industrial advances in the total declined to 25.7 percent.",

    "text": "Of the increase of Rs. 37.1 million in advances for industrial purposes in 1971, government corporations absorbed Rs. 30.1 million leaving Rs. 7.0 million to the rest of the private sector. Industrywise, the largest increase in advances went to'other industries'(Rs. 80.0 million), followed by the Engineering and Building trades (Rs. 12.5 million). Chemical products accounted for the largest decrease of Rs. 35.2 million, while advances to the textile industry also declined substantially by Rs. 20.7 million. The changes in advances to the other cate\u00adgories of industrial borrowers were not very significant. A detailed breakdown of advances for industrial purposes outstanding at the end of each quarter of 1971 is given in Table II ( D ) 12.",

The most significant feature was the substantial increase of Rs. 71.9 million in advances secured by pro-notes, bonds and usance notes; their weight in total advances went up from 13.3 per cent to 15.8 per cent- This again can be explained by the substantial increase in consumption and 'other loans' in the year. Advances against stock-in-trade and against guarantees also rose substantially by Rs. 71.9 million and Rs. 62.6 million respectively; their share in total advances rose from 18.7 per cent and 19.0 per cent respectively to 20.5 per cent and 20.2 per cent. Advances against trust receipts and against shares of joint stock companies, and the share of both in total advances, declined in the year.: ,",

The main features of the operations of the hire-purchase finance companies as revealed by the surveys as at the end of each quarter from June 1970 to June 1971 are presented in Tables II (D) 17 and 18.",
