The value added in wholesale and retail trade declined by 5.4 per cent at constant prices in 1971 as against an increase of 1.8 per cent in the previous year. This is attributed to a lower level of domestic agricultural production and volume of imports resulting in a fall in the supply of goods available in 1971. Value added in transport services has risen slightly in 1971 as compared with 1970. This is seen in a rise in the passenger mileage of the Ceylon Transport Board and Air Ceylon. Expansion in Government services particularly health and education, also contributed to the increase in the services sector. In addition, banking and insurance services rose in 1971; in 1971, 24 new branch banks were opened. Total value added in the services sector increased by 3.5 per cent at current prices and by 2.1 per cent at constant prices.",

These have been adjusted for the terms of trade effect in Appendix II - Table 6. This is necessary on account of the important role played by exports and imports in Ceylon's economy. Ceylon's terms of trade continued its declining trend in 1971, due to a rise in the prices of imports. According to the Central Bank indices of prices (1967=100) the all imports price index increased from 139.6 in 1970 to 150.1 in 1971, while the all exports price index declined slightly from 117.8 in 1970 to 117.1 in 1971. Ceylon's terms of trade declined by 7-6 per cent in 1971. The adverse effect of the decline in the terms of trade measured from the base year of 1959 is estimated at Rs 955 million compared to Rs 916 million in 1970. Real National Income obtained by adjusting estimates of real product for the terms of trade effect increased from Rs 8,780 million in 1970 to Rs 8,824 million in 1971. This is an increase of only 0.5 per cent in contrast to the rise of 0.9 per cent in real product. Since the rate of increase in real income was 0.5 per cent, the per capita real income in 1971 declined by 1.5 per cent.",

The estimates for 1971 which are provisional, do not include expenditure on fixed assets by the following Corporations and Boards-(1) Ceylon Ceramics Corporation (2) Paranthan Chemicals Corporation (3) Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporaticn (4) Ceylon Leather \\ Products Corporation (5) Ceylon State Hardware Corporation (6) National Milk Board - Condensed Milk Factory (7) State Timber Corporation (8) R.V.D.B. (9) Tea Research Institute of Ceylon (10) Air Ceylon (11) State Engi\u00adneering Corporation (12) Ceylon Coconut Board (13) Ceylon Tea Propaganda Board (14) Industrial Development Board (15) Vidyalankara University of Ceylon (16) University of Ceylon (17) Ceylon Savings Bank. 2- The accounting year of several Corporations does not coincide with the calendar year. When more than six months of a Corporation's accounting year fell within a calendar year, the accounting year's estimates have been allocated to that calendar year in toto. The data in respect of fixed capital formation in the corporations during 1971 excludes investment by some corporations. Therefore, aggregate of invest\u00adment by corporations in the year 1971 is strictly not comparable with the figures of investment in 1969 and 1970. However, due to the curtailment of imports, the total investment by corporations declined in 1971. In 1971, the investment by corporations amounted to Rs. 367 million and in 1970 it was Rs. 438 million. In 1970 investment had declined by 22.2 per cent.",
