A large amount of this increase (Rs. 83 2 million) was due to servicing of domestic debt. The unusually large increase in administration expenditure in 1970/71 was the result of defence expenditure almost doubling over the previous year in consequence of the operations against the insurgency. Gross food subsidy rose by Rs. 27-1 million in 1970/71 over the level of Rs. 574*3 million in 1969/70. When allowance is made for profits realised from the sale of sugar and flour, the net food subsidy rose sharply by Rs. 178-8 million or by 54'8 per cent. Although the cost of imported rice fell from Rs. 780 to Rs. 668 per long ton the effect of this price decrease was more than offset by increased issues of rice under the ration. The latter was the result of the decision to issue a second measure of rice at 75 cents per measure. Substantial price increases were experienced in respect of flour from Rs. 685 to Rs. 713 per long ton, and sugar from Rs. 727 to Rs. 887 per ton. Together with the decision to subject the import of sugar to FEECs, the higher import price resulted in an increase of Rs. 135 million in total cost of sugar. Besides, the' distribution expenses in respect of rice alone went up by 50 per cent to Rs. 7 \u2022 32 million on account of the increase in the ration.",

The actual (provisional) budget deficit rose by Rs. 147 million to Rs. 1,327 million. At the same time, non-bank market sources provided Rs. 586 million or Rs. 141 million more than the amount budgeted, mainly due to larger subscriptions from savings institutions arising from the combined effect of the implementation of the demonetisation measure, higher interest rates and increased collections from EPF following an increase in the compulsory contribution of employers and employees. Sinking funds, too, greatly increased their contributions. Foreign finance fell short of expectations by Rs. 268 million to Rs. 370 million despite the use of Rs. 100 million of the cash loan from the Peoples Republic of China. When allowance is made for the use of Rs. 123 million of cash balances1 the deficit requiring bank finance amounted to Rs. 106 million.",

Of this increase in 1971, the Central Bank contributed Rs. 41 million, consisting of an increase of Rs. 61 million in provisional advances offset partly by a decrease of Rs. 20 million in the Bank's holdings of government paper. The net increase in the Government's indebtedness to the Central Bank was appreciably lower than the increase of Rs. 156 million in 1970. The increase of Rs. 49 million in commercial bank credit to Government in 1971 was also considerably lower than the increase of Rs. 194 million in the previous year.",

A very large proportion of commercial loans (79 per cent) had maturites of up to one year, while 50 per cent of the industrial loans had the same maturity pattern. In contrast to a decline in credit for export and import trading in 1970 there was a substantial increase in credit for these purposes in this year. Loans for consump\u00adtion purposes increased by Rs. 38 million and as to be expected the bulk of these (74 per cent) were medium and long term loans with maturities ranging from 1 year and over.",

Continuing increase in defaults rendered a large number of cultivators ineligible for loans under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme. Accordingly the demand for these loans declined sharply.",

There was an improvement in the net external assets position due to a number of factors. The slackening of demand for imported goods as a result of the slow growth of the economy, continuation of the system of deferred payments and accumulation of short term credit for imports, an appreciable increase in foreign finance including a cash loan from the People's Republic of China and a reduction in the import programme as a deliberate policy of cutting down imports through tight import restrictions were the main factors responsible for a rise in net foreign assets. Nevertheless, the balance of payments on current account indicated a deficit of Rs. 209 million, in 1971 compared to a deficit of Rs. 350 million in 1970. In fact the impact of this deficit on external assets was only forestalled by the increased availabilty of foreign finance.",

Domestically produced goods experienced even larger increases in prices due to supply shortages, relatively lower yields of some of the agricultural commodities and a rise in production costs.

Considering the fact that the real Gross National Product rose only marginally, unemployment would have increased at a faster rate than the rise in the work force. This figure excludes the under-employed for whom no reliable estimates are available. An estimate based on a survey of 19641 puts the figure at 13 per cent of the work force. The triple task of keeping up with the rapidly rising labour force, reduction of the backlog of unemployment and looking for avenues for employment for the under-employed places a heavy burden on the economy.",

The debt servicing burden has increased from 10 per cent of export earnings in 1968 to 16 per cent in 1971 (partly due to a fall in export earnings). In absolute terms, debt servicing, including capital and interest charges and repurchases from the IMF, has risen from Rs. 207 million in 1968 to Rs. 303 million in 1971. Current projections show that this figure would exceed Rs, 500 million by 1975, without taking into account the servicing of debts which would be incurred after 1972; thus the actual amount is likely to be even larger.",
