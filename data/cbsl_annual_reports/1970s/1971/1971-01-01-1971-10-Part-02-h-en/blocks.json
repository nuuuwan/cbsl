    "text": "In 1971 the annual average of the Colombo Consumers' Price Index recorded an increase of 2.7 per cent which in comparison with increases of 7.4 per cent and 5.9 per cent in 1969 and 1970 appears to indicate a levelling off of a rising trend in the index. This, however, is deceptive as the annual average of the index fails to show the details of monthly increases in prices which in 1971 were very significant. From December 1970 to December 1971 the monthly index has gone up by 6.0 per cent and was mainly caused by a sharp increase in prices during the last four months of the year. In November the prices in the food group increased considerably. This is attributable mainly to the rationing and the increase in price of sugar outside the ration, and the resultant increase in prices of sugar based products and to the increase in price of the second measure of rationed rice.",

One of the factors contributing to this effect was the continuation of price controls of some of the imported consumer commodities. The sharp increase in the index for food that was recorded after August 1971 is the result of budgetary increase in prices of rationed rice (2nd measure) and sugar, the increase in vegetable prices and the increase in the price of imported butter following a rise in the world market prices. Some of the food items that recorded marked price increases are red onions (93%), tea B.O.P. (22%), cummin seed (15%), fennel seed (46%), mathe seed (57%), butter (54%) and jam (71%).",
