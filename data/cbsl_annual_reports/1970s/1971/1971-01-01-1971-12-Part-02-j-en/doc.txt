(J) FOREIGN T R A D E

1. Major Developments

The foreign trade of Ceylon contracted in 1971- As shown in Table 11 (J) 1 a small decline in exports was accompanied by a much larger fall in imports. According to Customs data, between 1970 and 1971, the value of total exports, declined by Rs. 86 million from Rs. 2,033 million to Rs. 1,947 million. On the other hand, imports fell by Rs. 327 million from Rs. 2,313 million to Rs. 1,986 million. Thus, on the basis of Customs data, the trade deficit of Rs. 39 million in 1971 represented a substantial improvement over the deficit of Rs. 280 million in the preceding year.1 It must, however, be emphasised that the improvement in the balance of trade was less the product of economic growth, than the result

of a forced cut-back in imports to a level consistent with Ceylon's foreign exchange situation.

This report leans heavily on Customs statistics, the main official source of data on foreign trade. Sam^ information is also available to the Central Bank from other sources, e.g. the Food C immissioner, the Rubber Controller etc. The comparison of such information with Custom-, d.ita has often revealed discrepancies, which can be attributed to the time lags in the r .-co-ding of exports and imports by Customs. These discrepancies have tended to narrow down in recent years on the adoption of appropriate remedial measures, but a new sour:e of large discrepancies has arisen from the trading activities of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. For eximple, in 1971, the export earnings from Bunkers as recorded by the Custom; amount to only Rs. 3.0 million, whereas figures supplied by the Corporation show that these earnings were as high as Rs. 86.5 million. On the imports side as against the Customi figure of Rs. 26 million, the Corporation is kncwn to have imported products to th: value of Rs. 164 million. Similar, but smaller, discrepancies are observed for 1970. Thui, in assessing developments in foreign trade, account must be taken at least of the known discrepancies between Customs data and those available from the institutions directly involved in the transactions. When such ad;ustments are made, the following picture emerges -

( 215 )

Price changes magnified the real impact on the economy of the reduction in import outlays. While the import outlays decreased by 14.1 per cent, the import volume contracted by 11.8 per cent. The restriction of imports affected both consumer and investment goods, with the latter bearing a proportionately larger share of the cuts.1 Compared with 1970, the value of imports of consumer goods decreased by 12.2 per cent while that of investment goods fell by 23.3 per cent.

The main cause of the fall in export earnings was the decline in the volume exported. . According to the Bank's trade indices (1967=100) the fall in volume amounted to 2.9 per cent over the level of the previous year. The price decline was confined to 0.9 per cent. The fall in volume was primarily in rubber, and it can be attributed to the temporary disruption of production during the civil disturbances in April-May.

Ceylon's terms of trade, which persistently deteriorated during the three preceding years, continued on its unfavourable course. At the end of the year the index (1967=100) registered 78 as against 84 at the beginning of the year - a * decline of 7 per cent. The adverse movement in the terms of trade was attribu­table (as in the past few years) mainly to a rise in import prices.

2. Exports

The reduction in export earnings in 1971 was due largely to a sharp decrease in export earnings from rubber, the effect of which was to some extent offset by increases in export earnings from tea and the three major coconut products. Table II (J) 2 reveals the composition of exports and their relative percentage shares in the total export earnings.

Tea

Production

Table II (J) 3 provides data on tea production by elevational category In 1971, tea production amounted to 480 million pounds. This was 12 million pounds or 2'5 per cent higher than the quantity produced in 1970, but was still below the 1969 level by 4 million pounds. The rise in production was due to the favourable weather conditions experienced in the tea growing areas, particularly during the second half of the year. The increase was confined to high and medium grown teas, the output of which rose by 7-6 million and 8-3 million pounds, respectively. Production of low growns fell by 3-6 million pounds.

Effect of Civil Disturbances on the Tea Industry

The outbreak of civil disturbances in April 1971 interfered with the smooth working of the tea industry for a short period. The insurgent activities, the declaration of a state of emergency and the enforcement of a curfew disrupted communications and transport facilities between planting areas and Colombo. Adverse effects were minimised by the use of the national broadcasting services to keep estates informed of ex-estate deliveries and other details regarding Colombo auctions. The tea trade (broadly defined to include planting, manu­facture, production, sales, storage and shipping) was declared an essential service under the Emergency regulations. No precise estimate of the damage to output from the civil disturbances is available; but judging by the total output in 1971 it can be considered negligible.

Exports

Despite the increase in production witnessed during the year, the volume of tea exported in 1971 of 4581 million pounds was lower by 2 million pounds or 0.4 per cent.

1 The tiguce is strictly not comparable with that for 1970 as the two are from different sources. Upto September 1970,' the export figures were based on the Customs entries while from October 1970 the figures are based on the Ship's Provisional Manifest, the most authentic source of the volume loaded to a ship.

( 217 )

Offerings at the Colombo auctions during 1971 at 393 million pounds increased by 20 million pounds or 5.4 per cent compared with that of 1970. In all, 47 sales were held during the year as against 49 during 1970. Through the medium of private sales 5 million pounds of tea were sold as against 4 million pounds in 1970. The quantity shipped direct to the London Auctions fell by 18 million pounds to 73 million pounds.

Exports by Destination

A significant feature in the country-wise distribution of exports was the diversion of tea from the U. K. to other markets, in particular, Pakistan. The absolute quantity of tea exported to U.K fell from 156.1 million pounds in 1970 to 1034 million pounds in 1971. This resulted in the proportion of tea absorbed by U. K. falling to 22.6 per cent, as compated with an average of over one-third in most preceding years. At the same time, Pakistan, which prior to 1971 imported a negligible quantity of Ceylon tea, emerged as a large-scale buyer. In 1971, she absorbed 29.4 million pounds, representing 64 per cent of Ceylon's total exports. As a result, Pakistan displaced the Union of South Africa as the fifth largest buyer

of Ceylon tea. The quantity of tea exported to the United States of America and Iraq, who were the second and third largest of the buyers, also increased significantly. Table II (]) 5 provides a classification of exports by destination for 1970 and 1971 together with their percentage shares.

Colombo Auctions

The average annual price of all teas increased by 18 cents (or 11 per cent) during the year 1971. Differentiated by elevational category, this increase was sustained mainly by the buoyancy of the sub-market for low-growns, and, to a much lesser extent, mid-grown tea: the respective average prices showing up 38 cents (or 28 p;r cent) and 14 cents (or 9 per cent) better compared with those achieved in 1970. The high growns, however, showed only a very marginal increase of 2 cents (or 1 per cent).

The improved price trends of the mid and low grown varieties of tea are, inter-alia, attributable to three reasons-

1. The state of unrest in the tea producing areas of Pakistan paved the way for the entry of Pakistan as a major buyer.

2. The substantially increased volume, and regularity, of purchases by Iraq.

3. The short-run inflexibility of tea supplies.

It is noteworthy that the prices fetched by mid and low-growns are the highest averages recorded over the last 10 years. Further, compared with previous years, a distinctive feature of price movements in 1971 was the failure of high growns to share the prosperity of mid and low-growns. Not only was the price differential between high and low-growns considerably narrowed down, but towards the end of the year the average price of low-growns in fact exceeded that of high-growns. The quarterly movements in the prices of the three cate­gories of tea, along with data on production and exports, are detailed in Table II (J) 6.

London Auctions

At the London Auctions the average price of teas from all producing countries declined by 2.42 pence to 43.25 pence per kilo. All three major suppliers to the London Auctions, Ceylon, India (North and South), and Africa felt the unfavourable price movements, but Ceylon teas were less affected than the North Indian. The price decline of North Indian teas occurred in the face of a sharp increase in quantities consigned to London, caused largely by the late arrival of the 1970 crop following labour disputes at the Port of Calcutta. The price decline of Ceylon teas as well as African teas was despite a drop in the respective quantities consigned to London. Much of Ceylon's loss is likely to have been occasioned by intensive competition from the North Indian crops. The failure of tea prices at the London Auctions to move in sympathy with those of Colombo does demonstrate the weakness of the linkages between the two markets. Detailed quantity and price data are set out in Table II (J) 7.

Instant Tea

Though the quantity of instant tea manufactured in 1971 (399,202 pounds) showed an increase of 150,307 pounds or 60.4 per cent over 1970, it represented only a 32.8 per cent increase over 1969. Customs returns indicate that 266,217 pounds of instant tea valued at Rs 2.8 million were exported in 1971. The corresponding figures for 1970 were 236,321 pounds valued at Rs 2.5 million. Exports to the U.K. amounted to 104,040 pounds or 39 per cent of the total, while exports to the Federal Republic of Germany were 79,678 pounds or 30 per cent and Australia 70,059 pounds or 26 per cent respectively.

International Tea Consultations

At a meeting of the FAO Consultative Committee on tea held in Rome in September 1971, a global export figure of 1,604.1 million pounds for the 15 month period from 1 January, 1971 to 31 March, 1972 was agreed, and the country quotas for the above period were also negotiated. India and Ceylon were allocated a joint export quota of 1115.5 million pounds for the period. Although the possibility of a long-term agreement was canvassed, no final decision was taken.

Tea Export Duty Rebate Scheme

The Tea Export Duty Rebate Scheme continued to be in operation through­out 1971, subject to certain changes in the sliding scaled. Four changes were effected as from the sales of 4th April, 1971, 16th June, 1971, 1st November, 1971 and 20th December, 1971. From 20th December, 1971, the lower qualifying limit was raised from Rs 1.30 to Rs 1.35 and the upper limit was reduced from Rs. 2.00 to Rs 1.85. In addition, the maximum rebate payable to low and mid-grown teas was reduced to 10 cents as against the earlier 17 cents. Table II (J) 8 provides particulars of quantities on which the rebate was granted and the total payments made during 1971.

Source: Tea Control Department. Rubber Production

Rubber production in 1971 is estimated at 312 million pounds, as compared with 351 million pounds in the previous year, reflecting a decrease of 39 million pounds or 11 per cent. The contributory factors that marred a higher level of production in 1971 were bad weather, which interrupted tapping operations, and

( 221 )

the disturbances which erupted in April. Out of the three major export crops, rubber was probably the most affected by the disturbances; some of the areas of intense insurgent activity were under rubber.

The production of sheet rubber at 175.8 million pounds recorded a decrease of 3 5 . 2 million pounds when compared with that of 1970. The decrease in the production of crepe rubber, however.was less marked.

Consumption

Local consumption of rubber in 1971 at 11.2 million pounds represented an increase of 2.9 million pounds or 35 per cent over 1970. As a percentage of total production, domestic consumption accounted for only 3.6 per cent.

Exports

Customs data indicate a decrease of exports by 69 million pounds or 19.5 per cent over 1970. Of this, 42 million pounds are accounted for by the fall in production and increase in domestic consumption, while a further 19 million poundsrepresent under-recording of exports by Customs.1

World trends in the production and consumption of rubber continued on their course in 1971. Supplies increased; so, too, did consumption. But supplies coming on to the market continued to outstrip consumption requirements. Although the rate of consumption rose faster than supplies between January/ September 1970 and January/September 1971, the increase was mainly in the consumption of synthetic rubber which further increased its share in total consumption from 60.9 to 62.5 per cent.

World price trends, however, continued to be affected by ad hoc factors of local origin sometimes operating singly and at other times in conjunction with others. World prices on the whole followed a downward course during the year and the following are some of the more important of the factors which acted to depress the market for natural rubber:

(1) Continued anxiety in the U. S. A. over the anticipated dock situation in the Western, Eastern and Gulf Coasts which may have induced some degree of substitution of synthetic to natural rubber and the postponement of natural rubber import orders.

(2) U. S. stockpile releases during the second half of the year, to which natural rubber prices are particularly sensitive.

(3) A general slowing down of growth in the major industrialised countries, coupled with the uncertainty among most rich countries of their export prospects as a result of the currency realignments following the effective devaluation of the U. S. Dollar and the imposition of a temporary surcharge on U. S. imports in August, caused some erratic market behaviour.

(4) Absence of certain major consumers from the markets at certain times of the year. For instance, during the first half of 1971, the People's Republic of China imported only 2,077 tons of rubber from Malaysia compared with 38,850 tons in the same period in 1970.

( 223 )

Some relief resulted through intervention by the Malaysian Rubber Fund Board; similarly, with the signing of the trade agreement between the Malaysian Government and the Government of the People's Republic of China, under which China agreed to buy 40,000 tons. However, the importance of these factors must be discounted in the context of a price fall of 4.36 new pence (or 23.4%) per kilo of R.S.S. No. 1 in the London market (i.e. from an average of 18.65 new pence in 1970 to an average of 14.29 new pence in 1971) and 22.83 Strait cents (or 18.7%) of R. S. S. No. 1 in the Singapore market (i.e. from an average of 123.28 Strait cents in 1970 to an average of 100.45 Strait cents in 1971).

Ceylon's rubber prices followed world trends. The average price of R.S.S No. 1 in the Colombo market moved erratically down from Rs. 0.84 per lb. in January 1971 to Rs 0.76 per lb. in August 1971. The average annual price of R.S.S. No. 1 in 1971 at Rs 0.79 per lb. reflects a marked decrease of Rs. 0.12 per lb. or 13 per cent over that of 1970.

Latex Crepe IX felt the unfavourable price trend only from July onwards when the average monthly ;price slumped from Rs. 1.30 in June to Rs. 0.83 at the end of the year. The price averaged for the year, however, showed a slight increase of one cent compared with the 1970 average, resulting from good prices prevailing in the earlier part of the year due to a temporarily tight spot position.

Exports by Destination

As in 1970, the People's Republic of China was the principal customer for rubber, accounting for 45 per cent of the volume exported. In absolute terms, however, the quantity shipped fell by 31 per cent to 128.9 million pounds.

Data on the volume of rubber exports by destination are presented in Table II (J) 11 along with the respective percentages.

The Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC)

The Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries had discussions with a view to achieving a closer integration among the rubber markets of S. E. Asia which would, inter alia, enable the region to evolve a joint marketing policy. The objective of such collective action is to secure stable and remunera­tive prices for natural rubber.

Coconut Products

Exports

The value of export earnings from the three major coconut products increa­sed by 16 per cent as compared with an increase of 7 per cent in 1970 due primarily to a volume expansion.

The quantity of coconut exports on a nut equivalent basis increased by 15.6 per cent from 874 million nuts in 1970 to 1,010 million nuts in 1971. This was, however, well below the peak level of 1968. Product-wise, the volume of coco­nut oil exports increased by 20.7 percent to 1,378 thousand cwts., copra by 12.8 per cent to 344,000 cwts and desiccated coconut by 7.9 per cent to 1,043,000 cwts. The f.o.b. value of copra and desiccated coconut decreased by 6.0 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively. The f.o.b. price of coconut oil however, increased by 5.1 per cent.1

General Price Trends

The decline in prices which set in from early 1971 continued virtually unchecked throughout the year. The average London market price of £172 per ton of coconut oil which had prevailed in January 1971 declined to £140 in June, and despite a recovery in the months of July and August, eventually reached £127 at the end of the year. Copra prices followed a similar trend, the fall in prices amounting to 32.3 per cent as between January and December. The slump in coconut oil and copra prices was the inevitable outcome of a large increase in world production of coconuts, induced by favourable weather conditions in the principal coconut growing areas. Exports of copra from the Philippines, the world's major supplier, are estimated to have increased by 66 per cent and exports of coconut oil by 21 per cent. Prices in the Colombo market moved in sympathy with world trends. The year-end prices of coconut oil, copra and desiccated coconut evidenced decreases of 6.5 per cent, 13.9 per cent and 9.4 per cent res­pectively. For the year as a whole the prices averaged out at Rs. 213 per candy of copra, Rs. 1,407 per ton of coconut oil and 58 cents per lb. of desiccated coconut.

Copra

The quantity of copra exported increased by 12.8 per cent from 305,000 cwts. in 1970 to 344,000 cwts. in 1971. The monthly average market price of Rs. 251 per candy in January 1971 fell to Rs. 205 in June, and after recovering to

1. The f.o.b. price of coconut oil which is derived from Customs data, needs to be accepted with certain reservations. The increase in the f.o.b. unit value is not consistent with the almost continuous decline in prices both in markets in Ceylon and elsewhere.

( 225 )

Rs.. 212 in July fell steadily to reach Rs. 175 per candy in December. In a back­ground of general world over-procjuction, restricted purchases o.f copra by India, Ceylon's major buyer, further acted to depress prices.

Coconut Oil

The volume of coconut oil exports increased by 20.7 per cent from 1,142 thousand cwts. to 1,378 thousand cwts. Movements in the price of coconut oil in the Colombo market ran parallel to world prices. Starting at a level of Rs. 1,543 per ton in January 1971, the price declined steadily (with a partial recovery in July/August) to reach Rs. 1,251 in December.

Desiccated Coconut

The exports of desiccated coconut increased by a smaller percentage (7.9 per cent) than copra or coconut oil. Prices of desiccated coconut,, too, followed trends, in international coconut markets. The January price of 65 cents per lb. fell to 52 cents in April, and after recovering to 67 cents in August, continued on its doyvnward course to reach 55 cents in December.

Exports by Destination

Copra

India, which absorbed as much as 64 per cent of Ceylon's copra exports in i970, accounted for only 38 per cent during 1971. Pakistan imported a larger share of copra in 1971 than in 1970, accounting for approximately 33 per cent of Ceylon's total copra exports. The next important buyer was the U.S.S.R. which purchased 87 thousand cwt., of copra in 1971.

Coconut Oil

The People's Republic of China became the largest buyer of Ceylon's coco­nut oil in 1971 dislodging the U. S. S. R. to second place. China increased her purchases to 510 thousand cwt., from 205 thousand cwt-, thereby accounting for

( 226 )

i7 per cent of Ceylon's exports. The U.S.S.R., although displaced to the second place absorbed a larger volume of coconut oil exports in 1971. Her imports increased by 51 per cent to 386 thousand cwt.

Desiccated Coconut

The United Kingdom maintained her position as the principal customer of Ceylon's desiccated coconut. She imported approximately 351 thousand cwt. of 34 per cent of total desiccated coconut exports as against 348 thousand cwt, in 1970. The Federal Republic of Germany accounted for 11 per cent of total exports importing 113 thousand cwt. of desiccated coconut in 1971. The next important buyers were the German Democratic Republic, Netherlands and France, which absorbed 8 per cent, 6 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.

Minor Exports

After three years of continuous growth, exportiproceeds of minor products declined in 1971,albeit slightly. By broad product groups, declines occurred in the spices, minerals and manufactured products groups, while other groups, par­ticularly coconut products and other agricultural products, showed enhanced earnings. The fortunes of a few commodities explain the movements in aggre­gate values in large part, naptha, residual fuel oils, cardamoms, cloves and pepper registered a cumulated shortfall of Rs. 24.4 million in 1971 as compared with their earnings in 1970. However, value increases recorded for minor coconut products (coir fibre-bristle, coir fibre-mattress, coconut shell charcoal, fresh coconuts) and fatty acids amounting to Rs. 14.4 million during 1971 limit­ed the overall decline in export proceeds to Rs. 8 million as compared with 1970.

A volume contraction rather than a general price decline has been the causal factor for the fall in total earnings from minor exports. Cloves, pepper, graphite, naptha and residual fuel oils are instances of significant volume decreases. But, apart from minor coconut products and fatty acids, all other volume increases recorded were not such as to make any noteworthy impression on overall earnings.

Stable or increased unit f.o.b. prices and a higher all-round volume of exports of all minor coconut products resulted in earnings rising to Rs. 68.9 million in 1971 from the 1970 level of Rs 56.7 million. As a group they fared best, and in a background of an overall decline in earnings from all minor exports, this improved performance increased the importance of this group from somewhat over a quarter in 1970 to over a third in 1971. While nut output is the ultimate -determinant of the volume of minor products turned out, the fav­ourable prices fetched by these non-traditional products in the external market in a situation where prices for the traditional coconut products the world over were disappointing, suggest the need for a continued drive towards achieving'maxi-mum levels of efficiency in production processes.

The spices group turned out the most disappointing export performance. In each of the two previous years its contribution exceeded Rs. 50 million and represented over a quarter of all earnings from minor exports. In 1971, however,

( 227 )

earnings declined to Rs. 33. 9 million while its importance was reduced to a sixth of total earnings. Pepper very nearly disappeared as a minor export when the volume dropped to a paltry 900 cwts. from the level of 16,900 cwts. reached in 1970 and 17,900 cwts. in the year previous to that. This was presumably due to a large scale diversion of the output to the domestic market consequent to the shortage of chillies and the resultant demand pressure on substitutes. (Inciden­tally, instances such as these are short-term factors which run counter to the basic strategy of import substitution: foreign exchange saved by restricting the import of one commodity can be offset to some extent by foreign exchange lost through reduced exports of another which is attracted away from the export to the domestic market). The preference of the domestic to the foreign market despite a near doubling of the f.o.b. export price of pepper is a measure o( the pull of domestic demand. .

As pepper, cloves, too, tended to disappear from the export scene. But unlike in pepper, no reasons for a greatly enhanced local consumption are apparent. In the unlikelihood of cloves being used as a substitute for another product, local consumption trends and export data are not adequate to explain the entirety of the domestic product. The fact that offerings at the Colombo Auctions too, have declined sharply despite the prevalence of scarcity prices points to an unexplained gap between the production of cloves and the amounts consumed locally and exported.

Cardamom export is one instance where a price fall rather than a volume fall has caused a decline in proceeds. A possible reason for lower prices is the revival of the Indian production.

In the minerals group, the lower production of graphite was due to a dislocation suffered during the civil disturbances in the early part of the year. Increased prices, however, helped maintain earnings. Exports of naptha and residual fuel oils, by-products of the petroleum refinery, declined to half the levels recorded for 1970. Inevitably, earnings, too, fell sharply.

Among other agricultural products, exports of unmanufactured tobacco, up from Rs. 2.2 million in 1970 to Rs. 6.9 million in 1971, caused mainly by a trebling of volume, showed the most noteworthy movement. The volume of cocoa exports was maintained, but the fall in export prices in line with trends prevailing in London reduced earnings from Rs. 7.2 million in 1970 to Rs. 6.2 million in 1971.

Exports of leather-based industries (footwear, tanned leather) have shown a steady volume and value increase between 1969 and 1971 with prices, on., the whole, steady. However, textiles, the single most important item in the broad category of manufactured products, turned in a markedly lower export volume. But favourable prices prevented this drop from affecting total proceeds.

Export Incentives and the FEEC Scheme

One of the objectives of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme is to provide price incentives for enhanced exports. A fairly dramatic response during the initial stages of the operation of this scheme was noted. Presumably, this was due to fuller use of existing capacity and diversion of products away from home to the export market. Growth since then has been disappointing. Partly, this may be due to the time lag involved between invest­ment in new capacity, stimulated at the commencement of the FEEC Scheme and production, which in agriculture is generally longer than in manufacturing industry, and partly, too, to certain factors which offset the incentive effect of the scheme; among them the increased attraction of the domestic market as a result

of import restrictions (e.g. pepper, textiles), and increased export duties on items like cocoa, graphite deserve mention.

The Crop Diversification Subsidy Scheme

The Crop Diversification Subsidy Scheme was in troduced inl.9701 under the Tea and Rubber Subsidy Acts for the cultivation of alternative crops on uneco­nomic tea and rubber lands. The scheme continued in force during 1971. It was extended to cover the cultivation of mulberry and lemon grass under which a subsidy of Rs. 500 per annum was paid in three instalmentsprovided that cultivation —

(1) was in place of uneconomic tea and rubber lands; and

(2) conformed to provisions relating to minimum acreages.

Permits were issued for the planting of 3,912 acres of uneconomic tea and 1,854 acres of uneconomic rubber lands with alternative crops in 1971. Of the acreages for which permits have been issued, the first and second instalments of the sub­sidy have been paid for. 1,495 acres of tea and 549 acreas of rubber lands. The total subsidy paid up to end-December 1971 on 1495 acres of tea lands was Rs. 462,000, while that on 549 acres of rubber lands was Rs. 396,615. The following table provides data on the acreages under respective commodities for which permits were issued up to end, December 1971 and those parts on which the first and second instalments have been paid.

According to Customs statistics the total value of imports decreased by Rs. 327 million in 1971, but when adjustments are taken into account, the decrease amounts to only Rs. 252 million. Table II (J) 16 presents a classification of imports after adjusting Customs data to reflect the actual values of the items imported by the Food Commissioner and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Data on an unadjusted basis are given in Table 11 (J) 18.

( 232 )

Table II (J) 16 shows that the brunt of the import reductions were borne by consumer goods and investment goods. The value of consumer goods fell by Rs. 149 million while that of investment goods fell by Rs. 127 million. Proportio­nately, however, the impact was much greater on investment goods; they fell by 23 per cent as compared with a reduction of only 12 per cent in consumer goods. These statistics reflect the relative inflexibility of Ceylon's requirements of consumer and intermediate goods and the inevitability of investment goods having to be sacrificed when, under balance of payments pressure total import expenditure has to be restricted.

Consumer Goods

Out of the reduction of Rs. 139 million in the value of consumer goods, Rs. 95 rniUion was accounted for by a reduction in the total expenditure on rice, flour and sugar imports. In fact, expenditure on rice imports alone declined by Rs. 165 million, but this saving was offset to the tune of Rs. 87 million by increased outlays on sugar imports. Table II (J) 17 sets out the data on rice, flour and sugar imports, both according to Customs entries and Food Commis­sioners records.

The reduction in expenditure on rice imports resulted mainly from a sharp fall in the quantity; it was also, however, assisted to a significant extent by a fall in prices. In 1970, the volume of rice imports ran at a high level owing partly to the higher level of consumption expected from the increase in the ration, and partly from the need to build up stocks in order to ensure a smooth flow of supplies on the ration. The latter represented a once-for-all demand which disappeared in 1971. Ceylon's import requirements also decreased substantially

in 1071, owing to the larger quantity of rice purchased domestically through the Guaranteed Price Scheme. These factors accounted for the reduction in the quantity of rice imports by 36.5 per cent to 334,000 tons. Average import price also declined by 16.1 per cent to Rs. 563.11 per ton as a result of the easier supply position of rice following good harvests in most of the major rice produ­cing countries of the world.

Flour

As compared with 1970, the decrease of Rs. 17 million in the value of flour imports was the net result of a reduction of quantity imported by 39,000 tons or 10.6 per cent and an increase in the average C &. F price by Rs. 19 per ton or 3.2 per cent. The landed cost of flour was affected by a rise in freight charges, which was brought about partly by the appreciation of European currencies against the U. S. dollar and partly by a scramble for shipping space to move grain from U.S. ports before the dock strike began in October, 1971.

Sugar

The substantial increase of Rs. 87 million or 57.2 per cent in the value of sugar imports was the combined result of an increase in volume of 17.9 per cent and an increase in price of 33.3 per cent. While it is true that sugar requirements of Ceylon are steadily increasing (because of the increase in population) impor­tance should not be attached to the year-to-year changes in the volume of imports, which are affected by the irregularity and size of shipments. The increase in price was, however, more significant. In 1971, world price of sugar, although fluctuating within a wide range, was consistently higher than in 1970. The factors that underlay the strong upward bias in price movements was the expected and actually realised shortfall in Cuban production, poor harvests in Eastern Europe and the conflict between India and Pakistan. Towards the end of 1971, speculative buying, induced by expectations of a tight supply situation, pushed prices to the highest levels reached since 1964. The activities of the International Sugar Organisation helped raise the average level of prices, but it was singularly unsuccessful in stabilising prices. The fact that as late as October 1971, the International Sugar Organisation agreed on cuts in export quotas to arrest a possible decline in prices underscores the difficulties in forecasting prices as only three months later prices nearly doubled.

Other Food Imports

Import expenditure on food items other than rice, flour and sugar, decrea­sed sharply from Rs. 262 million in 1970 to Rs. 215 million in 1971. This was mainly due to a virtual disappearance of onion imports the outlay on which was scaled down from Rs. 29 million in 1970 to Rs. 1 million in 1971 in line with the Government's strategy of import substitution in agriculture. Expenditure on gram and pulses also decreased from Rs. 63 million to Rs. 45 million.

Textiles and other Consumer Goods

Imports of textiles decreased from Rs. 124 million to Rs. 103 million, but imports of other consumer goods increased from Rs. 101 million to Rs. 115 million. Half the increase in the latter group was on account of medicinal and pharmaceutical products.

( 235 )

Intermediate goods

. . Customs data for this group of commodites need to be modified to take account of the under-recording of petroleum imports. When such adjustments are made, the total value of imports of intermediate goods shows hardly any change: they amounted to Rs. 526 million in 1971 as against Rs. 523 million in 1970. Within this group, however, there were significant changes. The value of petroleum imports increased by Rs. 33 million, tea and other chests by Rs. 11 million and chemicals by Rs. 10 million. These increases were offset by reduc­tions of Rs. 22 million in imports of fertilizers, and Rs. 34 million in miscel­laneous intermediate goods.

Investment goods

The value of imports of Investment goods fell by Rs. 127 million (23.3 per cent) to Rs. 419 million in 1971. Imports of building materials were virtually unchanged. The categories that were most affected were transport equipment, whose value fell from Rs. 126 million to Rs. 76 million, and imports of machi­nery and equipment which declined from Rs. 276 million to Rs. 200 million. These decreases reflect the tighter level of import restrictions which prevailed in 1971.

4> Cargo handled at the Ports

The total volume of cargo handled at the three ports, Colombo, Trinco-malee and Galle decreased by 6.4 per cent to 2,917,042 shipping tons reflecting the contraction in Ceylon's foreign trade. The Port of Colombo was relatively less affected; cargo handled here decreased by only 3.4 per cent. Particulars of the tonnage handled by the Colombo Port in each quarter of 1971 as compared with corresponding quarters of the previous year are given in Table II (J) 19.

Freight Rates

In a background of steadily worsening balance of trade, Ceylon has had to bear in recent years the additional burden of frequent increases: in freight rates. The year 1971 witnessed a continuation of this trend, with general increases of 10-15 per cent being introduced by Conference Lines as detailed below.

5. Pattern of Trade

Table II (J) 20 depicts the pattern of Ceylon's trade by principal monetary areas and regional groups. The contraction in Ceylon's foreign trade was felt mainly in the Sterling area. Imports from the Sterling area, however, fell more than exports, resulting in the trade deficit of Rs. 94.0 million in 1970 turning into a surplus of Rs. 42.2 million in 1971. Exports to the Dollar area increased slightly while imports fell by nearly one-third. Exports to the European Eco­nomic Community declined by Rs. 33.6 million while imports increased by Rs. 7.7 million. In the ECAFE region exports increased by Rs. 18.1 million, but imports declined by Rs. 184-7 million.

Trade with the People's Republic of China

The trade turnover with the People's Republic of China in 1971 decreased sharply by Rs. 199 million or 37 per cent on the 1970 level. Imports declined to a much larger extent than exports. A fall of Rs. 71 million in exports was accompanied by a fall of Rs. 128.2 million in imports. Thus, the balance of trade turned into a surplus of Rs, 20 million as compared with a deficit of Rs. 37.8 million in 1970.

( 238 )

The fall in the value of imports was caused principally by ajdecline of 53.5 per cent in the purchases of rice, the main import from China. This in turn was due to the lower requirement of rice imports in 1971 consequent to the availability of stocks built up in the preceding year and larger procurements under the Guaranteed Price Scheme. Increased purchases of textiles and chillies offset to a small extent the reduction of rice imports

The fall in the value of exports was the result of a greatly reduced volume of rubber shipments combined with a fall in world prices of rubber. As com­pared with 1970 the decline in volume was 30 per cent; in terms of value it was as much as 45 per cent. This was mitigated to some extent by an increase in both the volume and value of coconut oil exports. As compared with 1970, the volume increase was 149 per cent, while the value increase was 161 per cent.

* Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Germin Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and Yugoslavia.

The total trade turnover in 1971 with the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe contracted further by Rs 28 million or 8 per cent over 1970, due mainly to reduced imports from the region; the higher value of exports was not sufficient to offset the decrease in value of imports in 1971. The total traJe with this region as a percentage of the total trade turnover of Ceylon remained at 8 per cent as in 1970.

A commodity classification of trade with the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe is provided in Table II (J) 24.

The U.S.S.R. which accounted for 47 per cent of the total value of exports to the above region absorbed a larger share of 54 percent in 1971. While Ceylon's exports to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, G.D.R., Hungary, Yugoslavia registered increases in 1971, exports to Poland and Rumania indicated decreases over 1970. The value of exports of rubber to Czechoslovakia and G.D.R., in particular, recorded substantial increases in 1971 over the previous year. It is also significant to note that the value of exports of the three major coconut products to the U.S.S.R. in 1971 at Rs 46 million reflected a marked increase of 70 per cent over 1970.

The total value of imports from the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe in 1971 contracted by Rs 34 million as compared with 1970. The U.S.S.R., the major trading partner of the region, increased her share to 42 per cent in 1971 from 36 per cent in 1970. Imports from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and Yugoslavia recorded decreases over 1970; however, imports from the G.D.R. increased due mainly to the import of sugar in 1971 to the value of

7. Foreign Exchange Budget

The foreign exchange Budget as an intrument of resource allocation continued to be in operation in 1971. No major change has taken place in the administra­tive machinery for foreign exchange budgeting. Approximately 60 per cent of imports (based on licences issued in 1971) were in category 'B' and subject to the surrender of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates. The sources of finance were export receipts of 1971, commodity aid arrivals expected in 1971 (including the spill-over of aid negotiated in the period 1965 to 1970), project aid, drawings from I. M.F. and Suppliers' and other short term credits.

The Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates scheme introduced in 1968 was in operation in 1971. The price of the certificates continued to be Rs 55 per certificate of a face value of Rs 100.

8. Commodity Aid

The aggregate value of commodity aid arrivals, provided by twelve countries1, under the seven programmes in 1971 amounted to Rs 324 million representing an increase of Rs 2 million over the total aid received in 1970. The details of aid

received from the donor countries classified into consumer, intermediate and investment goods are set out in Table II (J) 26.

The major share of aid arrivals in 1971 totalling Rs 178.42 million consisted

of intermediate and investment goods, while the balance Rs 145.57 million consisted of consumer goods. The highest proportion of aid arrivals in 1971, totalling Rs 164.57 million, was under the sixth programme while the aggregate arrivals under the fourth, fifth and seventh programmes were Rs 157.29 million, respectively. Aid arrivals under the first, second and third programmes were negligible. Table II (J) 27 provides a breakdown of aid imports received in 1971 by commodities.

Within the intermediate and investment goods categories the main aid imports consisted of fertilizer (Rs 63.97 million), motor spares (Rs 20.14 million) tractors, implements and spares (Rs 19.58 million), industrial raw materials (Rs 17.25 million) and commercial vehicles (Rs 12.92 million). Aid financed imports of machinery and spares amounted to Rs 10.61 million and newsprint to Rs 7.44 million.

Under the consumer goods group, aid imports of wheat flour amounted to Rs 87.58 million, rice Rs 24.59 million, textiles Rs 22.24 million and tyres and tubes Rs 10.74 million. The source of rice and textile imports was the People's Republic of China.
