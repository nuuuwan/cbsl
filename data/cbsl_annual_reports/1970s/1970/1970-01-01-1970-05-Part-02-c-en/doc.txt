(C) P U B L I C ENTERPRISES

Several public sector enterprises in Ceylon which have been financially less viable in earlier years have been able to show profits recently. The sector as a whole is now expected to spearhead the economic development of the country. At present, in the public sector, thete are 24 major industrial and manufacturing corporations and 31 corporate bodies engaged in various service activities such as banking, trading, and transport. According to provisional data for 1970, the total value of output of goods and services by industrial corporations and those providing services was Rs. 1,940 million1 in 1970 as compared with Rs. 1,732 million1 for the previous year. The total value of production of the 24 indus­trial corporations amounted to Rs. 583 million in 1970, as against Rs. 424 million in 1969. Employment in the public sector (excluding government departments) has increased by 9 per cent ftom 145,544 persons in 1968/69 to 158,399 in 1969/70.

In 1969 a number of public industrial corporations particularly those engaged in the production of cement, tyres, salt, ilmenite, tanned leather and textiles, recorded an increase in output, but output of tea chests, sugar, rolled steel chrome leather and m-smmoties declined. These setbacks were the result of industrial disputes, marketing difficulties and the lack of adequate supplies of raw materials. Data on production for the first half of 1970 when compared with the data for the corresponding period in the preceding year show an improvement in the output of textiles, sugar, paper, chemicals, leather and tyres. However, on the basis of preliminary data, the financial performance in 1969/70 appears to have fallen considerably short of budgeted targets. This could be attributed to industrial unrest, unfavourable weather conditions and lack of adequate supplies of raw materials.

In 1969/70, 26 corporations including banks and other financial institutions have shown profits. Of these, 10 have made larger profits than in the previous year, 9 have made less profits while 1 made a profit as against a loss in the previous year. Twelve Corporations and the Ceylon Government Railway have incurred losses during 1969/70. Of these 6 have incurred bigger losses than in the previous year, 1 has reduced losses and 6 have incurred losses as against a profit in the previous year. Profit and loss figures for 1969/70 are not available in respect of 6 corporations; of these 3 made profits and 3 incurred losses in the previous year.

Financial profits or losses should normally be the criterion for evaluating the. performance of any public enterprise but this criterion should be used with some caution since public enterprises are not entirely free to fix prices and also, because they are often required to perform relatively uneconomic services which would not be undertaken by private commercial establishments. When industrial coiporations are required to subsidise groups and classes of consumers, such corporations could avoid having to put up with much ill-infotmed criticism by showing the results of such activities separately from their normal commercial activities.

1- These figures do not include the »aluc of services provided by the River Valleys Development Board and th* State Plantations Corporation as data are not available.

The overall improved performance of most public corporations in 1969/70 has been due to better utilisation of installed capacity, expansion of existing capacity and better planning.

Owing to the absence of uniformity and consistency in the financial proce­dures of most corporations, the Corporations Division of the Treasury issued in April 1970 a set of guidelines. On 1st June 1970, similar guidelines on the preparation of budgets were issued and the Ministry of Planning and Employment has also issued instructions on the preparation of comprehensive project reports. These measures should improve considerably the financial procedures, budgeting and project formulation of public corporations.

There has been a lack of useful and timely infotmation on the activities of State Enterprises on account of delays in the publication of Annual Reports and Statements of Accounts. It is important that the Cotpotations should make every endeavour to ensure that these reports are published within a short period after the end of the Accounting year.

The statistical data published in the following paragraphs and in the Tables are those provided by the respective corporations. Profit and loss data for years 1966/67 and 1967/68, of some corporations have been tevised on the basis of Reports of the Auditor General.

2. I N D U S T R I A L S E C T O R

In 1970 there were 24 boards and industrial corporations in the public sector engaged in manufacturing. These corporations were working to targets set by themselves at the tequest of the Ministry of Industries. A few undertakings such as the Fruit Canning factory of the Marketing Department and the State Distillery of the Excise Department functioned as government departments. The total capital investment of this sector increased by Rs. 394.9 million or 41 per cent from Rs. 952.9 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 1347.8 million in 1969/70.

In 1969/70 the total value of output of public sector enterprises in industry has increased by 38 per cent or by Rs. 159.1 million. The number of persons employed in this sectot has increased by 2,104 to 24,508 in 1969/70.

In 1969/70 the following corporations have increased their profits-Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation, State Flour Milling Corporation, National Salt Corporation, National Textile Corporation, Paranthan Chemicals Corporation, Ceylon Cement Corporation and Mineral Sands Corporation, while moderate profits, but less than in the previous year, were made by the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation, Ceylon Plywoods Corporation, Ceylon Tyre Corporation, Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation Ceylon Ceramics Corporation and the Ceylon Steel Corporation. The National Milk Board, National Small Industries Corporation, and the Ceylon State Hardware Corporation have been incurring recurrent losses ovet the past few years. The Ceylon Oils and Fats Corporation and the Leather Froducts Corporation have incurred losses in 1969/70 although they showed profits in the previous year.

The return on capital in state industrial enterprises is shown in Table 11(C) 3.

(A) Food, Beverages and Tobacco

(a) National Milk Board

The capital investment of the National Milk Board has increased by 28 per cent to Rs. 29.7 million in 1969/70. The Board's total value of production has doubled in 1969/70 and was Rs. 45.9 million as against Rs. 21.6 million in 1968/69. The latter has helped the Board to reduce losses from Rs. 950,000 in 1968/69 to Rs. 98,000 in 1969/70.

(b) Ceylon Oils & Fats Corporation

The value of production in 1969/70 was Rs. 31.7 million compated to Rs. 33.8 million in 1968/69. The capital investment at the end of these two periods was Rs. 27.6 million and Rs. 27.9 million respectively.

Although this Corporation has made profits in 1967/68 and 1968/69, it had incurred a loss of Rs. 2.0 million in 1969/70. After devaluation of the rupee in November 1967 the Corporation was tequired by Government to maintain prices of animal food at the pre-devaluation level in order to help the livestock industry. The resultant loss was made good by a Government grant and this grant was taken into account in calculating the profits of the Corpora­tion in the previous years. Since 1969/70, the grant has been excluded in the computation of profits and this would have been the major reason for incurring a loss in 1969/70.

The Corporation continued to earn foreign exchange from the export of fatty acids and glycerine. In 1969/70 the export of 876 tons of fatty acid earned Rs. 1.6 millon in foreign exchange while the earnings from 149.5 tons of glyce­rine were Rs. 253,200.

(c) Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation

The capital investment of the Corporation increased by Rs. 6 million to Rs. 87-1 million in 1969/70. Of this increase, Rs. 5 million was on the Kantalai factory and Rs. 1 million was on the factory at Gal Oya. The value of output increased from Rs. 14-4 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 24.7 million in 1969/70.

At Kantalai the output and quantity of sugar sold increased by 1,825 tons to 5,478 tons in 1969/70. The output of spirits declined from 832,000 to 768,000 proof gallons and sales declined from 795,000 to 770,000 proof gallons. The value of sugar and spirits sold decreased from Rs.16.7 million to Rs. 15.9 million in 1969/70. The overall profits of the Kantalai factory decreased from Rs. 8.4 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 7.2 million in 1969/70.

At Gal Oya, output of sugar declined from 4,700 tons in 1968/69 to 3,700 tons in 1969/70. The production of spitits on the other hand increased from 473,000 to 673,000 proof gallons and the sales quantity increased from 317,000 to 636,000 proof gallons. The value of spirits produced increased from Rs. 8.6 million to Rs. 12.2 million in 1969/70.

In 1969/70, as in the past, the Corporation was able to offset its loss on sugar from the revenue on spirits. In 1969/70 the overall profits of the Corporation were Rs. 11.1 million.

( 68 )

From the very beginning, the sugar industry in Ceylon has been confronted with difficulties resulting from faulty planning and management. Profits from sugar alone cannot be made unless adequate supplies of cane with a higher sugar content are assured; but the more remunerative production of spirits has, howeveT, enabled the Corporation to more than offset the losses incurred on Sugar.

(d) State Flour Milling Corporation

The total capital investment has increased by Rs. 7.6 million to Rs.32.9 million in 1969/70. Production has recorded a marked increase from 11,031 tons of flour and other products in 1968/69 to 56,591 tons in 1969/70. However, this is below the maximum capacity of 70,000 tons per year. The Corporation made a profit of Rs. 934,000 in 1969/70.

(e) National Salt Corporation

The total production of salt in 1969/70 increased by 11,900 tons or 11 per cent over the previous year and profits have increased by about 43 per cent from Rs. 1.9 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 2.8 million in 1969/70. The increase in production as well as in profits was probably due to favoutable weather condi­tions and to the 12 per cent increase in investment from Rs. 13.0 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 15.4 million in 1969/70. Increased profits were made despite the heavy unsold stock earned over from the past two years which the Corporation expects to sell in 1970/71.

(B) Textile, Wearing Apparel and Leather Industries

(a) National Textile Corporation

The total capital investment of this Corporation has increased by Rs. 154 million from Rs. 98.3 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 251.8 million in 1969/70. Of this increase, Rs. 152 million has been expenditure on the new textile mill at Tulhiriya which has not yet been completed. Although there has been no additional investment on the Veyangoda textile complex in the last few years, production of yarn and textiles has increased considerably and the capital out­put ratio of this plant has improved from 2 in 1968/69 to 1.4 in 1969/70.

The Corporation made a profit of Rs. 3.5 million in 1969/70 as against Rs. 2.7 million In 1968/69. Of this Rs. 1.3 million has been made from its trading activity.

The Corporation has plans to establish mills at Minneriya and Ambalango-da. The construction of a textile mill at Pugoda which was earlier abandoned has once again been revived. The Corporation continued to engage in the culti­vation of cotton but no data is available on this activity-

(b) Ceylon Leather Products Corporation

The total investment of this Corporation increased, by about 48 per cent from Rs. 7.1 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 10.5 million in 1969/70. The output of shoes increased from 275, 000 pairs to 281,000 pairs and the output of chrome leather from 667,000 sq. ft. to 688,000 sq. ft. while the output of bark and other leather declined from 364,000 lbs to 358,000 lbs in 1969/70.

( 69 )

The Corporation continued to face stiff competition from the private sector and its sales fell from 253,000 pairs in 1968/69 to 229,000 pairs in 1969/70. However, it increased earnings from Rs. 452,000 to Rs- 571,000 in 1969/70 from the sale of miscellaneous items although the total value of sales of all products declined from Rs- 6,975,000 in 1968/69 to Rs. 6,279,000 in 1969/70. The Corporation incurred a loss of Rs. 221,000 in 1969/70 as against a profit of Rs. 168,000 in 1968/69.

(C) Paper and Paper Products, Printing and Publishing

(a) Eastern Paper Mills Corporation

The total capital investment increased slightly in 1969/70 from that of the

previous year. The production of paper at the Valaichenai factory which

declined in 1968/69, increased in 1969/70. The paper imports which have been falling since 1966/67 due to import curtailment and availability of surplus

stocks recorded a further fall in 1969/70.

The profits recorded a sharp fall from Rs. 8. 4 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 4. 2 million in 1969/70.

(b) State Printing Corporation

The State Printing Corporation was set up primarily to cater to the increa-sing printing requirements of the government. The total capital investment in

1969/70 amounted to Rs. 3.6 million and it is expected to rise to Rs. 6.2 million in 1970/71. The Corporation did not undertake any printing work during the

year ended 31st March, 1970 since the installation of the machinery had not been completed.

(D) Wood and Wood Products

(a) Ceylon Plywoods Corporation

The total production of this Corporation in 1969/70 has been less than in the previous year. The value of production has fallen from Rs. 7. 4.million in 1968/69 to Rs. 5.6 million in 1969/70 and consequently ptofits too have fallen from Rs. 1.9 million to Rs. 0.6 million in the same period. However, the Corporation's total capital investment has increased from Rs. 12.3 million in 1968/69 to Rs.

76.1 million in 1969/70. This increase is due to an outlay of Rs. 64.6 million in

1969/70 on the wood manufacturing complex at Avissawella which has not been completed yet.

The Corporation has been making efforts to build up an export market for its veneer in luxury timber like satin, mahogany, kirihambiliya and hulanhik. During the financial year 1969/70, veneer and plywoods to the value of Rs.

201,000 have been exported; and in the period April 1970 to September 1970 plywood exports were worth Rs. 379,000. The Corporation's profits in

1969/70 fell far below the budgeted surplus of Rs. 2 million.

( 70 )

(b) State Timber Corporation

The State Timber Corporation which was established in 1968 undertook the extraction, sawing and the sale of timber, the construction of roads and the establishment of mechanised units to facilitate timber extraction. It also took over from the Forest Department all contracts for extraction of timber entered into by the Conservator of Forests with private contractors, all equipment used by the Forest Department for the extraction of timber, saw mills, timber impregnation plants, seasoning kilns and timber sales depots.

Data on actual performance for 1969/70 and the budgeted figures for 1970/71 were not made available.

( E ) Chemicals, Petroleum, Rubber and Plastic Products

(a) Paranthan Chemicals Corporation In 1969/70 the production of caustic soda and chlorine was less than in 1968/69 and below the target while the production of table salt was higher than in 1968/69. The Corporation continued to import caustic soda. On manufactur­ing, the Corporation has incutred a loss of Rs. 0. 3 million in 1969/70 as against a loss of Rs. 0.6 million in 1968/69; while on trading, mainly caustic soda imports, it has increased its profits from Rs. 958,000 to Rs. 1,231,000. Consequently, the Corporation has been able to increase its overall profit from Rs. 336, 000 in 1968/69 to Rs. 906, 000 in 1969/70.

The total capital investment of the Corporation has remained at Rs. 11.8 million in 1969/70 as in the preceding years.

(b) The Ceylon Tyre Corporation The capital investment of this Corporation has remained at Rs. 67.5 million since 1966/67- Production of tyres and tubes in 1969/70 fell far short of the budgeted targets. Capacity utilisation has been low and this can be attributed to the fact that ptoduction was limited to 6 tyre sizes. As production is restricted to meet the local demand for particular sizes, capacity utilisation will remain low unless an export market is found. In the case of tubes, production had to be curtailed due to slow movement of existing stocks as tubes cannot withstand long storage. Low capacity utilisation could also be attributed to the dearth of trained skilled personnel, particularly assembly operators in the production department.

The Corporation has not been able to export any of its products in 1969/70. The profits of the Corporation have fallen slightly from Rs. 3.7 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 3.3 million in 1969/70.

(c) Ceylon Fertiliser Corporation The total capital investment in 1969/70 increased to Rs. 27.6 million from Rs. 20.9 million. In 1969, the Corporation imported less fertilizer than in the previous year but expects to increase its imports in 1970/71 due to the higher targets fixed by the Ministry of Agricultute.

The profits of the Corporation have fallen to Rs. 3.7 million in 1969/70 from Rs. 15.9 million in 1968/69.

(d) The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

Oil Refinery

The total outlay on the Refinery has increased by about Rs. 77.0 million to Rs. 180.0 million in 1969/70 while production of the refinery too has correspondingly incteased by Rs. 117.7 million to Rs. 175.4 million in the same period. The profit and loss figutes of the operation of the refinery were, how­ever, not available.

In 1970, the refinery exported naptha, fuel oil and bunkers worth about Rs. 23 million in foreign exchange. In 1971, it expects to increase its exports to the value of about Rs. 39 million.

The refinery has been able to meet the entire petroleum requirements of Ceylon and in 1970 started production of liquid petroleum gas (L.P.G.)

Lubrication Oil Blending Plant

Prior to the establishment of the Lubricating Oil Blending Plant lubricants which had to be imported ^involved higher costs for packaging and higher differential rates for freight. The total investment in this Plant rose from Rs. 4.6 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 6.0 million in 1969/70.

The Blending Plant, with a production capacity of 4,032,000 gallons, produced 3,843,470 gallons of lubricating oil in 1969/70 and made a profit of Rs. 3.1 million.

(e) The Ceylon Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation

This Corporation which was established in 1969 took over, the activities of the Ayurvedic drugs manufacturing unit of the National Small Industries Cor­poration in July 1969 and its operations now include the manufacture, import and sale of Ayurvedic, Siddha, and Unani drugs and conducting research.

The capital investment in 1969/70 was Rs. 1.4 million and the value of production in the same year was Rs. 1.1 million. The Corporation made a profit of Rs. 136,000 in 1969/70.

(f) The Ceylon State Fertiliser Manufacturing Corporation

This Corporation which was established in 1966 is expected to set up a Urea factory with a capacity of 285,000 tons per annum. The total outlay on preliminary site work as at end of 1969/70, was Rs. 4.9 million. The Corporation is expected to utilise naptha obtained from the Oil Refinery of the Petroleum Corporation in the manufacture of fertilizer. The Plant is expected to be commissioned inl975.

(F) Non-Metallic Mineral Products (except Petroleum Products)

(a) Ceylon Ceramics Corporation

The total capital investment of the Corporation has remained at Rs. 20.03 million in the last three years. The value of production has fallen slightly from Rs. 8-8 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 8.2 million in 1969/70 while profits fell from Rs. 4.3 million to Rs. 3.4 million.

( 72 )

The Corporation's output of sanitaryware exceeded the target by 15 per cent while the profit from this activity exceeded the target by about 63 per cent mainly due to the increase in production and better utilisation of resources. Profits from Kaolin fell below budgeted figures due to the high cost of Dediya-wela clay which had to be purchased on a tender basis.

(b) Ceylon Cement Corporation

In 1969/70, the total capital investment of the Corporation has increased by Rs. 22.3 million to Rs. 186.2 million. The entire increase of this investment has been utilised in the Kankesanturai factoty. The Corporation's total turnover from the two plants at Kankesanturai and Galle has increased to 268,336 tons in 1969/70 from 240,632 tons in 1968/69. In 1969/70, the output of cement and clinker at the Kankesanturai factory was 188,221 tons and 244,096 tons respectively; the factory at Galle had a turnover of 80,115 tons of cement. The Corporation recorded a 100 per cent increase in profits ftom Rs. 13.2 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 27-4 million in 1969/70, even though the increase in sales was only 40 per cent. At the Galle factory alone, profits have increased from Rs 0.9 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 5-8 million in 1969/70.

(c) National Small Industries Corporation

In 1969/70 the total capital investment in this Corporation was Rs. 24.4 million, an increase of Rs. 5.5 million over the previous year. This increase represents the additional investment made on the brick and tile factory. The value of total production (including ayurvedic drugs) has fallen from Rs. 8.2 million in 196P/69 to Rs. 7.9 million in 1969/70, but value of sales has remained unchanged at Rs. 7.7 million. In 1969/70, the Corporation's output of tiles has increased by 497,338, the output of bricks has declined by 518,016 and other clay products increased by 461,292 as compared with the output in 1968/69.

The Carpentry Section has been incurring recurring losses over the last decade due to the unrealistic prices on intra-government sales. Standard items of furniture are supplied to Government Departments at prices fixed by the Treasury Price Fixing Committee based on the price structure awarded to the Department of Rural Development and Small Industries and are less than prime cost The income from the furniture'manufactured at the Corporation's Carpentry Workshops which had declined in 1968/69 has shown an improve­ment in 1969/70 but the loss incurred on this activity has increased.

The Corporation which has been incurring heavy losses during the past few years has incurred a further loss of Rs. 1.7 million in 1969/70 which is more than the previous year's loss.

(d) Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation

The total capital investment was Rs. 15.9 million in 1969/70 as against Rs. 14-8 million in 1968/69. The Corporation increased its production of ilmenite from 75,986 tons in 1968/69 to 77,356 tons in 1969/70 and also increased its exports of ilmenite from 73,430 tons in 1968/69 to 81,482 tons in 1969/70. Foreign exchange earnings rose from Rs. 3.39 million to Rs. 4.09 million.

( 73 )

The Corporation produced 1,549 tons of rutile in 1969/70 as against 1,967 tons in 1968/69 but while no rutile was exported in 1968/69 the Corporation was able to export 2,830 tons in 1969/70. The Corporation was not able to com­mence production of zircon as anticipated until September, 1970. The higher production and turnover of ilmenite and the sale of higher priced rutile [has enabled the Corporation to increase profits from Rs. 1.1 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 2.2 million in 1969/70.

(G) Basic Metal Industries (a) Ceylon Steel Corporation

The Corporation's capital investment has remained at Rs. 117.0 million in the last few years. The production of rolled sections which increased in 1968/69, recorded a fall in 1969/70. The output of wire products which increased in 1968/69 recorded a marginal fall in 1969/70, probably due to prolonged labour unrest. Sales of rolled sections and wire products, however, increased in 1969/70. The Steel Rolling Mill and the Wire Mill with an annual capacity of 60,000 tons and 12,000 tons per annum respectively continued to operate well below capacity.

In 1969/70, the Corporation made a profit of Rs. 2.6 million and was able to maintain profits at the level in previous years. The profit and loss figures on the trading activities of the Corporation in 1969/70, were not available separately but in the previous year the Corporation incurred a loss of Rs. 230,000 on trading.

( H ) Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Equipment (a) Ceylon Hardware Corporation

The capital investment of this Corporation rose to Rs. 38.0 million in 1959/70 from Rs. 36.2 million in the previous year. The value of production has fallen from Rs. 5.0 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 3.6 million in 1969/70. Despite this sales have increased from Rs. 3.1 million to Rs. 4-9 million in the same period. In 1969/70, the Corporation incurred a record loss of Rs 4 8 million compared to the loss of Rs. 0.7 million in the previous year.

The Corporation's output of mammoties in the period January/September 1970, was 33,700 while the output for the corresponding period in 1969 was 64,100. Labour unrest was the major cause of the heavy fall in production, work slowed down and production of mammoties fell from 800 to 200 per day. However, after mid 1970 labour problems were resolved and production increased to 1,000 per day.

(I) Fishing (a) Ceylon Fisheries Corporation

In 1969/70, the total investment of the Corporation has increased by 57 per cent or Rs 30.6 million to Rs. 843 million. The amount of fish caught has declined from 9.9 million pounds in 1968/69 to 8.1 million pounds in 1969/70. Total sales have increased from Rs. 8.8 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 13.2 million in 1969/70. Over the last few years this Corporation has been incurring heavy losses and the loss in 1969/70 has not yet been assessed.

( 74 )

The Corporation has been exporting a variety of fish including lobsters to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. In 1968/69, the total quantity exported was 871,800 pounds for Rs. 824,000 in foreign exchange. The total quantity exported in 1969/70 was 775,700 pounds for Rs. 731,400.

(J) Construction

(a) State Engineering Corporation

The total capital investment has increased from Rs. 26.6 million in 1968/69

to Rs. 33.3 million in 1969/70.

The Corporation undertook Rs. 59.7 million worth of contracts in 1969/70 and the value of contracts outstanding at the end of the year was Rs. 161.9 million. Its income in 1969/70 was Rs. 8.7 million as against Rs. 8.1 million in 1968/69. However its profits have fallen sharply from Rs. 2.7 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 0.6 million in 1969/70.

t Revised figures based on Auditor General's Report. Capital investment in the Corporation increased from Rs. 33.5 million in 1965/66 to Rs. 39.2 million in 1966/67. It declined to Rs. 32.0 million in 1967/68, and again increased to Rs. 36.3 million in 1968/69. In 1969/70 capital investment stood at Rs. 38.7 million of which Rs. 31 • 7 million was on plant­ations and Rs. 7,030,000 was on factories.

Rubber, coconut and cocoa estates of the Corporation made profits partly because the prices of these products were maintained at satisfactory levels. The results from the tea estates of the Corporation were generally unsatisfactory partly because prices declined. The estate at Pelawatte incurred a loss of Rs. 127,782. This was because the factory could not operate for nine months due to a breakdown in two of the thtee engines, due to shortage of labour, poor out-turn and low tea prices Yahalatenne/Deppitiya was managed by the Corporation till it was subsequently handed over to the Land Commissioner for alienation to peasants.

4. S E R V I C E S S E C T O R

The Services Sector in Public Entetprise includes Corporations, Boards and several Government Departments. The total investment in these corporations and the Ceylon Government Railway (excluding other Government Depart­ments) was Rs. 2,830.0 million in 1969/70 as against Rs. 2,634.2 million in 1968/69 representing an increase of 7.4 per cent. Total employment in 1969/70 had increased from 144,336 to 150,645.

(B) Transport, Storage and Communications

(a) Ceylon Government Railway

The total investment at the end of the financial year 1968/69 of Rs. 665.7 million is estimated to have increased by approximately Rs. 30 million to Rs. 696 million at the end of 1969/70.

The number of passengers carried is estimated to have increased by 1.5 million in 1969/70 as compared to an increase of 4 million in the previous year. Passenger mi'eage in 1969/70 shows a greater increase than in 1968/69 while the increase in passenger receipts from Rs. 57 million to Rs. 60.5 million in 1969/70 is less than in the previous year.

Despite the competition from road transport, the volume of goods traffic has shown a matginal increase of 0.2 million tons. Ton-mileage of goods shows an inctease of 5 million tons as compared to the decrease of 1.5 million tons in the previous year and total revenue from goods transport has also recorded an increase.

Total estimated revenue of the railway shows an increase of Rs. 7.4 million which is higher than in the previous year while total expenditure has increased by Rs. 5 million. The greater increase in total revenue has enabled the railway

( 78 )

to reduce its overall loss by Rs. 2 J million to Rs. 55.1 million. The overall loss of the railway has fluctuated from Rs.50.3 million in 1965/66 to Rs. 46.2 million in 1966/67 and reached a peak of Rs. 57.4 million in 1968/69.

(b) Ceylon Transport Board

Certain salient features of the Board's operations during the four yeats ending 1969/70 and the estimates for 1970/71 are shown in Table II ( C ) 10.

Total capital investment by the Board increased by Rs. 48 million to Rs. 315.4 million in 1969/70. Of this Rs. 251.8 million was in respect of vehicles and the balance Rs. 63,6 million was on garages, depots, shelters, etc.

The vehicle fleet owned by the Board increased by 445 to 6,326 in 1969/70. The operational stock of buses increased by 1,066 and the effective available stock by 599.

The scheduled mileage in 1969/70 increased by 19.6 million miles while the opetated mileage increased by 16.4 million miles. Lost mileage caused by breakdowns and non-availability of crew at required times increased by 10.3 million miles to 42.8 million miles. Dead mileage due to empty travel of buses from garages to starting point etc., was reduced from 1.9 million miles in 1968/69 to 1.5 million miles in 1969/70.

The total number of passengers carried, which had been increasing steadily over the years, rose to 1,356.7 million in 1969/70. While the total seat miles increased in 1969/70 by 690.2 million the total passenger-miles increased by 237.9 million. This resulted in a slight decrease in the load factor (the ratio of passenger miles to capacity seat miles) from 61.5 per cent in 1968/69 to 60 per cent in 1969/70. The avetage vehicle utilisation representing the number of miles operated by a bus per day which had remained at the same level from 1966/67 to 1968/69 declined in 1969/70 from 157 to 154 miles per day.

Employment at the Board had been increasing rapidly over the past years. In 1966/67 workforce was 32,165 and in 1968/69 was 40,097. In 1969/70 employment increased by 1,328 to 41,425. The increase in employment has been greater than the increase in buses operated. In 1966/67 the number of employees per bus on available effective fleet was on an average 8.2 and in 1969/70 was 9.0.

The revenue of the Board increased by Rs. 8.3 million to Rs. 287.8 million and expenditure increased by Rs. 29.9 million to Rs. 322.1 million in 1969/70. The greater increase in expenditure offset the increase in revenue and resulted in the Board operating at a loss of Rs. 34.2 million in 1969/70 as against a loss of Rs. 13.2 million in 1968/69 and a loss of Rs. 7.2 million in 1967/68.

(c) Air Ceylon Limited

The value of assets which increased to Rs.31,960,000 in 1968/69 declined to Rs. 29,715,000 m 1969/70.

( 79 )

In 1968/69 the number of passengers carried by Air Ceylon declined by 2,214, the tonnage of goods carried fell by 27 tons, and the passenger mileage declined by 958. The load-factor showed an increase on the internal services and in terms of total revenue in 1968/69 was expected to show a profit. But total expenditure in 1968/69 according to estimates has increased and the final outturn was a decline in profits. During the year 1969/70, there was an appre­ciable increase in the frequency, both in the international and internal services, hence the estimated increase in passengers and goods carried. However, this increase was not proportionate to the increase in the capacity made available through the increase in frequencies.

According to estimates for 1969/70 total revenue shows an increase from Rs. 10,565,000 in 1968/69 to Rs. 19,761,000 in 1969/70. Total expenditure shows an appreciable increase of Rs. 15,484,000 due to the payment of FEECs on the import of aircraft spares, etc., and the increase in maintenance and other operational costs with the introduction of the Trident Jet Aircraft in September 1969 and the increase in the wage bill. The greater increase in expenditure has offset the increase in revenue resulting in a loss of Rs. 5.5 million in 1969/70 as against an estimated profit of Rs. 742,000 in 1968/69.

(d) Colombo Port Commission

The estimated capital investment by the Port Commission on the basis of a 1955 valuation of assets amounted to Rs. 326.8 million in September, 1970. With the development work in the current year it is expected to rise to Rs. 348.8 million A substantial portion of this investment has been in the Port of Colombo.

Revenue which had declined slightly in 1966/67 and had risen appreciably from Rs. 33.8 million to Rs. 36,3 million in 1967/68 continued to follow an upward trend in 1968/69 and 1969/70 when it amounted ;o Rs. 44.3 million.

Working expenditure for 1969/70 which has also shown an increase is expected to record a further rise in 1970/71 due to increased maintenance cost resulting from higher cost of material on account of FEECs and the devaluation of the rupee, to the payment of higher wages and overtime to employees on consolidated salaries and increased cost of free meals supplied to port workers.

The increase in revenue in 1969/70 has been offset by a greater increase in working expenditure with the result the Commission has recorded an overall deficit of Rs. 4-4 million as against a profit of Rs. 6.6 million in 1968/69. How­ever, in the case of the Colombo Port revenue exceeded working expenditure in 1969/70.

(e) Port (Cargo) Corporation

Certain salient aspects on the operations of the Corporation during the last five financial years (August to July) are shown in Table II (C) 10.

The capital investment of the Corporation at the end of July 1970 was Rs.66.2 million representing an increase of approximately Rs. 2 million over the previous year. This increase was in respect of the Trincomalee Port.

The tonnage of cargo handled by the Corporation which had increased by 346,000 tons to 3.5 million tons in 1968/69 declined marginally in 1969/70. The cargo handled at the Ports of Colombo and Galle in 1969/70 declined by 30,000 tons while cargo handled at the port of Trincomalee increased by 26,000 tons. The reduction in revenue by Rs. 1.5 million and the increase in expenditure resulted in the Corporation recording a loss of Rs. 5.4 million on its operations in 1969/70 as against a profit of Rs. 2.6 million in 1968/69.

(f) Port Tally and Protective Services Corporation

The initial capital of the Corporation is Rs. 1 million and the charges levied by the Corporation are fixed by order made by the Minister in consultation with the Board of Directors.

As shown in the last year's Annual Report1 the income of the Corporation in 1968/69 had risen to Rs. 7.5 million and although expenditure had also increased the higher increment in income had enabled the Corporation to increase its profits to Rs. 0.8 million. Data relating to the financial year 1969/70 were not made available and hence it is not possible to review the Corporation's per­formance for the period. However, according to budgeted estimates the Corpora­tion's profit has decreased to Rs. 0.2 million.

(g) Postal and Telecommunication Services

Capital expenditure has increased from Rs. 121.4 million in 1967/68 to Rs. 130.6 million in 1968/69. The increase in capital expenditure was mainly for the expansion of the Post and Telecommunication Services. The expenditure on postal services increased by Rs. 2,900,000 in 1968/69 primarily on account of wage increases, but the increase in income of Rs. 3,900,000 was mainly due to a higher allocation by the Treasury of the share of stamp revenue. The latter was respon­sible for the increase in the surplus to Rs. 3,596,000, In the case of telegraphic services the reduction in income resulting from a reduction in the share of revenue from collections on telephone and overseas telecommunication services offset a small reduction in expenditure and the overall loss has increased to Rs. 2,219,000 from Rs. 1,297,000 in 1967/68.

The higher income from telephone services in 1968/69 due to an improvement in the collection of telephone tariffs set off a smaller increase in expenditure and the overall deficit has been reduced to Rs. 641,000 from Rs. 1,553,000 in 1967/68

The commercial accounts of the Department show an overall profit of Rs. 596,000 in 1968/69 as against a loss of Rs. 319,000 in 1967/68.

(C) Wholesale and Retail Trade

(a) Co-operative Wholesale Establishment

The Co-operative Wholesale Establishment's growth and transfer of certain activities to other institutions has been shown in the Annual Report of 1968.2

Certain basic statistics relating to the Co-opertive Wholesale Establishment for 5 years ending 1970 are given in Table II (C) 11.

1- Annual Report, 1969. page 82. 2. Annual Report 1968, page 114.

( 83 )

Working capital has increased progressively from Rs. 64.5 million in 1966 to Rs. 98.1 million in 1968, and in 1969 it reached Rs. 100.9 million. However according to budgeted estimates for;1970 working capital has declined to Rs. 65.8 million.

The turnover which has increased steadily until 1967 has shown a declining trend in 1968 and 1969. The turnover for 1969 amounted to Rs. 397,631,000 and the profit before taxation was Rs. 31,270,000. The corresponding figures for the previous year (1968) were, Rs. 758,066,000 and Rs. 42,436,000 respectively. The fall in the turnover in 1969 could be attributed mainly to the transfer of its sugar trading activity to the Food Commissioner.

Due to the greater increase in expenditure the budgeted profit (before

taxation) for 1970 is Rs. 15.8 million as against the profit of Rs. 31.3 million in

1969. Profit of the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment has declined

progressively from Rs. 56 million in 1967 to Rs. 31.3 million in 1969.

(b) The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

Certain salient features of the trading activities of the Corporation from

1967 to 1971 (calendar years) are shown in Table II (C) 11.

The total capital investment of the Corporation increased by Rs. 86.9 million to Rs. 267.3 million in 1970 on account mainly of the Oil Refinery

Project (Rs. 76.8 million), the trading network (Rs. 8.9 million) and .the Blending

Plant (Rs. 1.4 million).

The Corporation's purchases (imports and local purchases) were higher while sales were lower in 1970 than in the previous year. Sales of gasoline, auto diesel and kerosene increased while sales of industrial diesel and furnace oil recorded a decline. In 1970 although the quantity of oil sold was less, the value of sales rose by Rs. 25.2 million to Rs. 403.2 million.

Total income of the Corporation rose by Rs. 25.8 million to Rs. 406.5 million in 1970 as against the increase by Rs. 21.9 million to Rs. 380.7 million in 1969. The trading for the year ended December 31, 1970 resulted in a profit

of Rs. 20.7 million (before taxation) as compared with a profit of Rs. 22.6 million (before taxation) for the previous year.

Owing to higher cost of purchases and distribution expenses the Corpo­

ration has budgeted for a smaller profit of Rs. 17,984,000 in 1971.

The capital investment in 1968/69 was Rs. 811,000. This was increased . to Rs. 2,602,000 in 1969/70 and according to budgeted estimates for 1970/71 is Rs. 16,143,000. The total revenue which increased marginally from Rs. 250,000 in 1968/69 to Rs. 252,000 in 1969/70 is budgeted to rise to Rs. 500,000. On the o.her hand expenditure has been increasing substantially from Rs. 1,017,000 in 1968/69 to Rs. 2,936,000 in 1969/70 and is expected to be Rs. 17,000,000 in 1970/71. The sharp increase in expenditure and the comparatively negligible increase in revenue has resulted in a significant increase in the deficit from Rs. 196,000 in 1968/69 to Rs. 332,000 in 1969/70. According to budgeted estimates the deficit in 1970/71 is Rs. 11,000,000.

t Based on Auditor General's Report.

The value of assets of the Corporation was estimated to be Rs. 15.2 million in September 1970 representing an increase of approximately Rs. 3 million over the previous year. Revenue in 1969/70 shows a marginal increase while expenditure shows a greater increase. As a result the Corporation showed a loss of

Rs. 854,000 in 1969/70. Although the Corporation made profits in the previous

three years its profits have been declining annually at a considerable rate.

Provision has been made in the estimates for 1970/71 in a sum of Rs. 11.9 million, of which Rs. 5.5 million represents aid from the Federal Republic of Germany for the expansion of Broadcasting Services and studio facilities; Rs. 6.4 million representing local expenditure is proposed to be met from a Government

grant while foreign aid amounting to Rs. 5.5 million is expected as an outright

( 90 )

grant from the Federal Republic of Germany in the form of equipment for Stage

II of the Medium Wave Expansion Scheme. However, work was held up as

the relevant agreement has still not been signed and no provision has been made in the Government estimates for a grant from the Consolidated Fund to meet

the local expenditure.

In the period 1969/70 the Board conducted 64 lotteries as against 56 lotteries in 1968/69. However, the income from the sale of tickets declined from

Rs. 37,297,000 in 1968/69 to Rs. 34,548,000 in 1969/70. Total expenditure declined from Rs. 36,115,000 in 1968/69 to Rs. 33,832,000 in 1969/70. But the reduction in income from the sale of tickets was mainly responsible for the

Board recording a lower profit of Rs. 716,000 in 1969/70 as against Rs. 1,182,000 in 1968/69.
