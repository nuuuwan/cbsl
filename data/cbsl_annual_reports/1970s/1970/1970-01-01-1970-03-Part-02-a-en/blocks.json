    "text": "An analysis of the sectoral composition of real economic growth shows that there were increases in agriculture and services while output in construction and manufacturing was at a higher level. Output in agriculture, forestry and fishing increased by 3.6 per cent in 1970, compared with 0.9 per cent in 1969. In this sector, the production of paddy and subsidiary food crops, recorded signi\u00adficant increases. Tea production dropped to its lowest level in eight years, while coconut production was at about the same level as in 1969 In the case of rubber, the increase in production was 5.5 per cent. Growth of output in the agricultural sector, on account of its relative share in Gross National Product, exerts a larger influence on overall economic growth. In 1970, the rate of increase of 3.6 per cent in agriculture was accompanied by a slowing down in the rate of expansion in the manufacturing sector. The smaller rate of growth in this sector was chiefly due to the lesser availability of raw materials. There was also a fall in the manufacturing of tea. The output of public sector industrial corporations, however, increased substantially. In the construction sector, there was an increase of 15.1 per cent in real terms. This increase was chiefly due to the greater availability of building materials. Construction activity was at a high level in the government and public corporations and the private sector.",

Tea production has shown a downward trend since 1965 when production was 503 million pounds. This downward trend in production is chiefly due to producers adjusting production to improve prices. It is reported that most of the larger estates have resorted to finer plucking in order to improve the quality and the price of tea. In addition, bought leaf tea factories insist on quality leaf, thus depressing production in small holdings. The downward trend in tea production is also attributed to reduced fertilizer application in tea planta\u00adtions in recent years. In 1970, production was also affected by unfavourable weather conditions during certain parts of the year. The average yield per acre of tea was 811 pounds in 1970 compared with 845 pounds in 1969. In 1970, the fall in the output of tea was confined to high and medium grown teas, while the output of low grown teas increased.",

In 1969, however, investigations made by the Bank, seemed to indicate that production was at about the same level as in 1968. The estimate of production adopted for 1969, was therefore the same as in 1968. However, as there is no ifrm evidence of an increase in the domestic consumption of coconut, and as the nut equivalent of exports has declined in 1969 and 1970, this estimate has been revised. The revised estimate of coconut production in 1969 is therefore 2,440 million nuts. Coconut production in 1970, as estimated on the same basis is 2,447 million nuts, an increase of 0,3 per cent.",

    "text": "Economic activity in the services sector particularly in trade and transport, was at a lower level in 1970. This is chiefly because, the level of domestic production and imports resulted in a fall in the supply of goods available in 1970 as compared to 1969. The value of output in wholesale and retail trade increased by 1.8 per cent in 1970, and the value of output in transport increased by 1.5 per cent. While the overall increase in the transport sector was small ^ there was a substantial increase in passenger transport run by the Ceylon Transport Board and in goods haulage by the Ceylon Government Railway. Passenger mileage by the Ceylon Transport Board increased by 7.5 per cent in 1970. There was also an expansion in health and education services provided by the Government.",

As is seen from Appendix Table 4, there were moderate increases in agriculture and services, while in manufacturing and construction output was at a higher level. The increase in Gross National Product in 1970 was due partly to an increase in prices and partly to an increase in real product.",

According to the Central Bank indices of prices (1967=100), the all imports price index increased from 133.9 in 1969 to 139.6 in 1970, while the all exports price index increased from 117.3 in 1969 to 117-8 in 1970. It is estimated that the loss of income (calculated from the base year 1959) as a result of the adverse movement of Ceylon's terms of trade was Rs- 903 million in 1970 compared with Rs. 814 million in 1969. Real National Income which is obtained by adjusting estimates of real product for the loss of income due to the adverse movement of the terms of trade is estimated at Rs. 8,793 million in 1970 compared with Rs. 8,503 million in 1969.",

These figures were not available for inclusion in the estimate for 1969. The pattern of investment according to industrial categories in public sector corporations is markedly different from that of the government. As is seen above, in the government sector, 31.8 percent of investment was in agriculture and 29.9 per cent in transport and communications. In the public sector corporations, 61.1 per cent of invest\u00adment was in manufacturing, 20. 2 per cent in agriculture and 12.7 per cent in transport.",

Investment in building and construction increased by Rs. 140 million, investment in plant and machinery increased by Rs. 84 million while investment in transport equipment fell by Rs. 63 million. The fall in investment in transport equipment is due to the fall in imports in this category. In 1970, 41.3 per cent of the increase in private sector investment was in building construction, reflecting the increased demand for construction and the greater availability of building materials.",
