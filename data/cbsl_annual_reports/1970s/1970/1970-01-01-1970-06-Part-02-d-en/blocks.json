The money supply fell sharply by Rs. 140.9 million in November, as a result of the demonetisation. Government cash balances improved considerably while bank credit to Government declined, thus causing a marked contraction in the money supply in November. This trend was reversed in December when, largely as a result of government operations, the money supply rose again by Rs. 39.9 million or 2.1 percent.",

In the first ten months of 1970, however, the expansion caused by government financial operations was Rs. 165.6 million. In the next two months,* due to the increased resources available to the Government as a consequence of the demonetisation, the expansionary effects were considerably reduced. In 1970 Government's cash balances improved by Rs. 124.2 million in contrast to the drawing-down of Rs. 71.9 million in 1969.

The substantial increase in total liquid assets was made possible because of an inctease of Rs. 368.3 million, or 14-1 percent, in secondary liquid assets, principally in the form of savings deposits with the commercial banks and the Post Office Savings Bank; government bonds and tax reserve certificates also rose appreciably. At the end of 1970, secondary liquid assets formed 60.3 percent of total liquid assets as against 58.2 percent a year earlier. This increase in secondary liquid assets may almost wholly be attributed to the demonetisation. At the end of September 1970, secondary liquid assets were 57.1 percent of total liquid assets.",

At the end of 1970, demand deposits formed 52.5 percent of total primary liquid assets (money supply) as against 42.4 percent at the end of 1969. This again is wholly attributable to the demonetisation; at the end of September 1970, demand deposits amounted to only 43.3 percent of the money supply.",

Between May and July there was a fairly steady decline in the holdings of these currency notes, possibly in anticipation of govern\u00adment measures (like demonetisation) directed against tax evasion and hoarding of currency notes of high denominations. The shate of the Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 denominations in the total currency issue dropped from 63.6 percent at the end of May to 58.7 percent at the end of July. The volume of these currency notes began to increase gtadually thereafter, but was drastically reduced at the end of November with the demonetisation.",

Time deposits, which increased by Rs. 102.6 million in 1969, showed only a modest increase of Rs 19 5 million in 1970. Savings deposits, on the other hand, in\u00adcreased by Rs 159.2 million in 1970 as against an increase of Rs. 55.5 million in the previous year. The slower growth of time deposits in 1970 may have been due to such factots as the increase in the holdings of goverment claims by the non-bank private sector and the increase in public deposits with hire purchase finance companies. Although the growth of time deposits was slow in 1970, the stability of these deposits was maintained. The turnover rate of time deposits decreased from a monthly average of 0.19 in 1969 to 018 in 1970; the turnover rate of savings deposits remained unchanged at 0.09. The substantial increase in savings deposits with commercial banks may be largely attributable, to the demonetisation.",

The increase in the non-bank private sector's holdings of government claims in 1970 amounted to 30.2 per cent of the total increase in secondary liquid assets as against 25.6 per cent in the previous year. However, the holding of government claims, especially government bonds, continue to be confined almost wholly to institutional investors.

    "text": "The substantial increase in deposit liabilities was due largely to the demo\u00adnetisation; between December 1969 and September 1970 the increase in deposit liabilities amounted to Rs. 179.6 million. The smaller increase in borrowings from the Central Bank may again be mainly attributable to the increased deposit resources available to the commercial banks as a consequence of the demoneti\u00adsation. Between December 1969 and August 1970, borrowings from the Central Bank increased by Rs. 115.0 million. In September, however, with the repayment by the commercial banks of the re-finance loans granted to them by the Central Bank against their loans for purchases of paddy under the Guaranteed Price Scheme, their outstanding borrowings from the Central Bank were reduced sharply by Rs. 209.1 million. In October, as a result of large drawings of new Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 notes in connection with the demonetisation, the banks' borrowings from the Central Bank recorded an abnormal increase of Rs. 336 8 million. With the surrender to the Central Bank of the demonetised currency notes, the outstanding level of borrowings declined by Rs. 278.1 million at the end of November.",

The substantial increase in cash holdings was due to the abnormally high level of cash holdings recorded for the last three months of the year as an effect of the demonetisation. The average monthly level of cash holdings in the first nine months of the year has been lower than that of the previous year, as may be seen from Table II (D) 8; the average monthly ratio of cash to total deposits in the first nine months has also been lower at 12.7 per cent compared to 13.4 per cent in 1969.",

The monthly average of treasury bill holdings for the first nine months of the year was Rs. 41 million, or 2.1 per cent of total deposists as compared with an average of Rs. 50 million, or 2.7 per cent of total deposits in 1969.

Of the increase of Rs. 28.7 million in the year, government corporations absorbed Rs. 7.5 million while other borrowers in the private sector accounted for the balance of Rs. 21.2 million. Industry-wise, the largest increase went to 'other indusries' (Rs. 16.9 million) followed by chemical products (Rs. 8.0 million), processing of tea, rubber and coconut (Rs, 7-0 million) and metal products (Rs. 6.8 million). Textile industries, which accounted for the largest increase of Rs. 46,9 million in 1969, showed a decrease of Rs, 8.4 million. The changes in the advances for the other groups of industries were not significant.
