(B) INDUSTRIAL P R O D U C T I O N

1. I N T R O D U C T I O N

The present survey of industrial production relates to industrial activity both in the private and public sectors in the calendar year 1970. Data on production, employment, wages, man-hours, cost of fuel and power and value of raw materials were obtained by a postal questionnaire addressed to the various industrial units followed up by personal visits, where necessary, and supplemented by information available at the Ministry of Industries and Scientific Affairs.

The object of this analysis of data on industrial activity is to evaluate the principal trends in industrial development and to highlight some of the more important features associated with performance in the various branches of the industrial sector.

The value of industrial production in 1970 recorded by an aggregate of 1853 reporting industrial units was Rs. 1945.0 million. This includes for the first time, the output of the Petroleum Refinery which commenced commercial production towards the end of 1969. If for purposes of comparison of production data for the years 1969 and 1970, the value of output of the Petroleum Refinery of Rs. 181 million is excluded, then the actual increase in the total value of industrial production in 1970 over that of the previous year is 8.4 per cent. This increase as compared with an increase of 16.3 per cent in 1969 was chiefly due to substantial increases in output recorded by a few State enterprises. The share of public and private sector industry in the total value of industrial production for 1970 was 31 per cent and 69 per cent respectively. About 58 per cent of the total value of industrial production is contributed by two main cate­gories, namely, Food, beverages and tobacco, and Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products, while 45per cent of the labour force covered by this survey are employed in industties in these categories.

Industrial Policy

In 1970, major policy decisions on industrial development were announced by the Government with a view to reorganising the existing industrial set-up in Ceylon in keeping with the social and political objectives of the Government. In this regard, the following aspects are important:

(a) The encouragement and fostering of those industries where there would be a greater utilisation of indigenous raw materials;

(b) exploring th; possibilities, wherever feasible, of the State importing industrial raw materials in bulk for supply to local manufacturers;

(c) quality and price control of manufactured goods.

In approving new industries priority is to be given to those industries where the raw material content of products is wholly indigenous or where the percen­tage of local raw materials used is high. The implementation of this criterion

( 37 )

would change the pattern of raw material utilisation in industries, and will result in substantial savings in foreign exchange expenditure on imported raw materials.

The progressive import of industrial raw materials by the State is intended for the purpose of obtaining cheaper prices due to bulk purchases which in turn would contribute to a reduction in the foreign exchange outlays on raw material imports. It is also expected to eliminate foreign exchange malpractices and thereby save scarce foreign exchange which is lost through the over-invoicing of raw material imports.

The State control of raw material imports if geared to an efficient system of supplying requirements could ensure the standardization of quality and could keep production costs down to the advantage of the consumer.

Location of Industry

Table 11 (B) 8 shows that industrial units are concentrated in the Western Province, especially in and around Colombo. About 81 per cent of the indust­rial units are located in the Western Province, while the balance are spread over eight provinces. The Southern Province having the next largest concentra­tion hts 5.2 per cent of the reporting industries and the North Central Province has the lowest concentration with only 0.1 per cent.

Government's recent policy on the location of industries stipulates that high priority will be given to industries which are to be located in under-deve­loped or non-industrlalised parts of the country provided the location costs were not unfavourable. This assurance could stimulate investment in the non-industrialised areas, but a pre-requisite for this would be the provision of the basic infra-structure in non-urban areas. Government's policy of extensive electrification of the country and the development of roadways is likely to help in the dispersion of industry. The location of industry in non-urban areas, while solving the problems of unemployment and under-employment in these areas, would also to some extent relieve pressure on housing in the urban areas of the Western Province.

Production

In 1970, all 9 major categories of industries listed in Table II (B) 1 showed in­creases in the value of production; the highest increase was in Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products, while the lowest was in the category Paper and papsr products. Considering the overall increase in the value of production of Rs. 318 million, categories which were chiefly responsible for this increase were the Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products (60 per cent), Food, beverages and tobacco (14 per cent) and Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment (9 per cent).

An analysis of the performance of groups of industries in Table II (B) 2 reveals a few interesting features. The increase in the value of production of the Food preparations group was almost entirely contributed by a State enterprise which nearly doubled its value of output in 1970. In the Preserved and canned

fruit, vegetable, meat, fish and other sea food group, although there was a reduction in the number of firms, yet, there was an increase in the value of out­put of approximately 37 per cent. The contraction in the number of firms in this group could be attributed to the expansion in the output by a State enter­prise whose value of production increased by 51 per cent in 1970. The Beverages and spirits group whose output has increased considerably is accounted for by a 23 per cent increase in output in the sub-group Beverages. The Garments and Footwear groups also show increases in the value of output. In thet Garments group, although there was a reduction in the number of firms, an increase in output was recorded due to the expansion in production by a few large firms.

In the main category Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products) the group Petroleum and coal products shows an increase in the value of output

of Rs. 181 million, contributed entirely by the Petroleum Refinery which commenced commercial production towards the end of 1969, and has been included in this survey for the first time. The increase in the value of output of the group Cement, cement products and asbestos products was also due to the expansion in production by the Cement Corporation whose output rose by 16 per cent. Another group which recorded an appreciable increase in output was

Electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and supplies where the value of production rose by as much as 33 per cent. This group of industries has shown

a steady upward trend in the value of production in the period 1967-1970, increasing by an average of 47 per cent per year. A substantial increase in produc­tion in this group may be explained by the increase in demand for electrical appliances and equipment resulting from rural electrification and increased incomes generated in the agricultural sector.

A classification of industrial sub - groups according to increase in value of

production is at Table II (B) 2 (1).

In 1970, all sub - groups except Bricks and tiles, Machinery and equipment and Ceramics recorded increases in the value of production. However, three sub' groups which had an increase in output between Rs. 5-20 million and two sub­groups with an increase in output between Rs. 20 50 million in 1969 have been relegated to the Rs.0-5 million range in 1970. Similarly, one sub-group in the Rs. 20-50 million range in 1969 has moved down into the Rs. 0-5 million range in 1970. Only one sub-group, namely, Petroleum and coal products recorded an increase in output exceeding Rs. 50 million.

Table II (B) 2 (2) gives the change in the number of firms and the corres­ponding change in the value of production. In all major categories except Basic Metal Products (no change), despite the decrease in the number of units there has been an increase in the value of output. Firms that have closed down are mainly the smaller units and this has had no significant impact on the value of production.

The data relating to the value of production for the period 1966-70 as set out in Table II (B) 2 show that the shares of the two categories, Food, bevera­ges and tobacco; and Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries have gradu­ally declined from 45.9 per cent and 21.0 per cent in 1966 to 35.2 per cent

( 44 )

and 14.5 per cent in 1970, respectively. On the other hand, the shares of the

two categories Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products; and

Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment have increased from 16.1

per cent and 8.2 per cent in 1966 to 22.6 per cent and 13.2 per cent in 1970

respectively.

Some of the sub-groups illustrated in Table II (B) 2 have had significant increases in the value of production in the year 1970. In the sub-group Beve­rages and spirits, the increase has been solely due to the expansion in output of beer and stout, and aerated mineral waters, whose production increased by 38 per cent and 48 per cent respectively. In the Preserved and canned products sub-group, the increase in output is accounted for by two units which have in­creased their output of canned products and preserved meats by 55 per cent and 137 percent respectively. The rapid expansion in the production of preserved meats is a result of import substitution, and also increased consumer demand for these products by the hotel and tourist trade.

A classification of industrial production by the major economic categories, namely, consumer goods, intermediate goods and investment goods, as given in Table II (B) 3 shows that over the period 1966-70, while rhe share of consumer goods has been decreasing from 56.5 per cent in 1966 to 47.6 per cent in 1970, the shares of intermediate and investment goods have increased from 34.9 per cent and 8.6 per cent in 1966 to 36.0 per cent and 16 4 per cent in 1970, respectively. Consumer goods which recorded significant increases in production in 1970 were dairy products, beer and stout, aerated mineral waters, preserved meats and shirts, while in the intermediate category, paper cartons and boxes, wrapping paper, electrical machinery and supplies and petroleum and coal products showed marked increases in production. In the investment goods category, increases in production were recorded by galvanised products, machinery (except electrical machinery), cement, cement products, asbestos products, rolled steel and wire products.

An evaluation of data relating to size distribution of firms based on value of output (Table II (B) 4) indicates a definite trend of polarisation of output among the larger firms. In 1970, of the total number, 10 per cent of the firms whose value of output was Rs. 2 million and over contributed as much as 82.8 per cent of total output. This trend is very clearly illustrated by data for the period 1966-70. In 1966, 6.2 per cent of firms in the output category of Rs. 2 million and over accounted for 63.6 per cent of output, while the corresponding figures for 1967 and 1969 are 5.5 and 66.4, and 8.2 and 78.1 per cent respectively. In the other two categories of less than Rs. 250,000, and Rs. 250,000 and less than Rs. 2 million, the opposite trend is witnessed, where a higher percentage of firms produced a very small share of output. In 1970, a total of 958 firms in the cate­gory kss than Rs. 250,000 produced only 4 per cent of total output, while in 1969, it was 1,105 and 5.9 per cent respectively. In the category of Rs 250,000 and less than Rs. 2 million, 289 firms contributed 13.2 per cent of output in

1970, while the corresponding data for the previous year were 306 and 16.0 per cent respectively. As may be observed in Table II (B) 4 (1), the extent of concentration of output in a few firms varies in the different categories of industries.

In the Biscuit and confectionery group, 83.2 per cent of output is accounted for by 8 firms, while 4 firms in the Beverages group, and 5 firms in the Tobacco group contributed 90.5 per cent and 84.7 per cent of output respectively. Footwear and Cement and asbestos products are two other groups of industries where large firms have dominated the market.

Data on the size distribution of firms, based on the wage bill, as depicted in Table II (B) 5 also bear a direct relationship to the concentration of output in a few firms. In the category where wages are Rs. 500,000 and over, 74 of a total of 1,378 firms account for 70.5 per cent of the total wage bill in 1970, while in the category of less than Rs. 15,000, 692 of a total of 1,378 firms account for only 2.4 per cent of the total wage bill.

The trend in the consolidation of the larger industrial units is further illus­trated in Table II (B) 4 (1) by data relating to production, employment and wages of 180 firms whose value of output exceeds Rs. 1 million.

It is interesting to note that only 180 units or 9.7 per cent of the total num­ber of reporting firms account for 69.0 per cent of the total wage bill and 68.4 per cent of the total value of industrial production.

5 E M P L O Y M E N T A N D W A G E S

In 1970, inspite of the decline in the number of reporting firms by 109, there was an expansion in employment, which is indicated both by the increase in the number of employees and the man-days per employee. The number of employees rose from 103,726 in 1969 to 105,105 in 1970, while the man-days per employee increased from 273 to 276 over the same period. Categories where an increase in the value of production was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of employees were Food, beverages and tobacco and Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries which are mainly labour intensive, and the Chemi­cals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products which includes for the first time the data relating to the Petroleum Refinery. On the other hand, in the category Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment, a contraction in the number of firms and employees has had no impact on the value of output which increased by Rs. 29 million, mainly because these industries are not labour intensive.

About 75 per cent of employees in the industrial sector comprise males, while permanent and casual labour are 80 and 20 per cent of total employees respectively.

The total wage bill of reporting firms increased from Rs. 199.5 million in 1969 to Rs. 229.4 million in 1970. Moderate gains were recorded in the wage bills of the categories Food, beverages and tobacco (10 per cent) and Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products (15 per cent), while Non-metallic mineral products except petroleum and coal; and, Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries had increases of 40 and 45 per cent respectively.

In the category Food, beverages and tobacco which has the highest wage bill, 33,734 employees or 32 per cent of total employees producing 35 per cent of total output received Rs. 64-4 million or 28 per cent of total wages. The Textiles wearing apparel and leather industries has the next highest wage bill of Rs. 46.0 million or 20 per cent of the total wages. These wages were received by 27,069 employees representing 26 per cent of total employees. The two above mentioned categories alone account for 48,58 and 50 per cent of total wages, employment and production respectively.

Wages per man-day and man-days per employee also recorded increases in 1970. Three categories which have low wages per man-day are Food, beverages and tobacco; Textiles, wearing apparel and leather industries; and, Manufactured products (not elsewhere specified). The lower wages per man-day in these categories are attributable to the relatively high percentage of female or casual workers whose wages are usually less than that of male or permanent employees.

and this pattern of raw material utilisation has remained almost static during the period 1966-70. The situation is even less optimistic in the categories Fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment; and, Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products, where there has been a definite trend of increasing utilisation of foreign raw materials. However, there are a few categories such as Paper and paper products and Non-metallic mineral products, except petroleum and coal, where it is apparent that there has been a progressive substitution of local raw materials for imported inputs. In the category, Food, beverages and tobacco there has been a perceptible increase in the proportion of foreign to local raw materials. The increased utilisation of foreign raw materials which amounts to 62.4 per cent is due to a substantial increase in the production of 4 large units in the Food preparations and Beverages groups which consume a high percentage of imported raw material.

Since the value of raw materials used in industry comprise about 50 per cent of the value of production, it is of fundamental importance that every end­eavour should be made to develop indigenous raw materials. In this connection, it is unlikely that the private sector will embark on raw material processing; even if this happens, this will be a gradual process. The steps in this direction may have to be taken by the State especially in the context of Ceylon's present foreign exchange problems.

7. P O W E R A N D F U E L

Statistics relating to the use of power and fuel in industry as given in Table II (B) 7 show that about 50 per cent of the cost of power and fuel is accounted for by petrol and oil, while the share of electricity, and coal and gas, are 41.6 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively. In the previous year, the share of petrol and oil, electricity, and coal and gas, in the total cost of fuel consumption was 41.2, 49.1 and 3.5 per cent respectively.
