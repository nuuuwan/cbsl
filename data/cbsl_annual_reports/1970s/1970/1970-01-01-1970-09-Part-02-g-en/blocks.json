In the past, a high level of external resources had to be mobilised mainly to meet the deficit in the current account and to amottise a moderate level of external debt. A noticeable change that has occured in 1970 is, that of the resource gap of Rs. 1,124 million, Rs. 468 million or 41.6 per cent only consisted of the deficit in the current account. The balance of Rs. 656 million was on account of capital payments.
