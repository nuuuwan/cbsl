Two new currency notes of the denomination of Rs. 100/- and Rs. 50/- were issued on 26.10.70 to replace the old design demonetized currency notes. These notes are of an entirely new design. The reproduction of the statue of King Parakramabahu the Great on the fronts of the notes of both denominations was replaced with the portrait of the late Prime Minister, Mr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. On the back of the Rs. 100/- note, the Sigiriya fresco was replaced with a picture of a drummer and three Kandyan dancers and on the Rs. 50/- note, the reproduction of the Moonstone and steps with a reproduction of the Vihara Maha Devi Monument.",
