1. Overall Trends

Total domestic export earnings in 1970 showed a marked increase as compared with the preceding year and was the highest level recorded since 1968. The increase was due largely to expansion in the volumes of exports of tea, rubber and other domestic products, the effects of which were strengthened by increases in the export prices of tea and the three major coconut products.

In 1970, the value of exports inclusive of re-exports was Rs. 2,033 million and that of imports Rs. 2.3131 million, resulting in a merchandise trade deficit of Rs. 280 million.

With the exception of the year 1968, when the value of exports in rupee terms increased substantially, export earnings had shown a declining trend since 1966. In terms of U. S. dollars, however, the declining trend begun in 1966 continued through 1968. In 1970, the value of Ceylon's exports was Rs. 117 million more than that recorded for 1969. The dollar equivalent of expott earnings in 1970 was U. S. $ 342 million and was U. S. $ 20 million higher than that of the pteceding year.

The value of imports, which began increasing in 1968 reached a peak in 1969 and exceeded the 1968 level by Rs. 370 million or 17 per cent. However, the rising trend in import values was reversed in 1970 and the total for the year decreased by Rs. 230 million or 9 per cent to Rs. 2,313 million.

The net trade position at the end of 1970 was a merchandise trade deficit of Rs. 280 million, compared to a deficit of Rs. 627 million in 1969/- the highest on record. The reduction in the adverse trade gap in 1970 was due both to a substantial increase in export earnings and a sharp decrease in import values as compared with the preceding year. The merchandise trade deficit for 1970 expressed as a percentage of total export earnings for the year was 14 per cent as against 33 per cent for 1969 and 7 per cent for 1968. To finance the ttade deficit, the country had to tely on sources other than domestic export earnings.2 In the composition of imports in 1970, there has been an increase in the import of 'consumer goods', while imports of 'intermediate' and 'invest­ment goods' decreased. In 1970 consumer goods in value terms increased by 6 per cent over the preceding year. Within the 'consumer goods' category, the share of the 'food and drink' group increased, due largely to increased imports of rice, flour and sugar,3 while the share of 'other consumer goods' decreased. The value of 'intermediate' and 'investment goods' decreased by 24 per cent and 22 per cent respectively.

1- The figure of aggregate imports needs to be interpreted with reservation. As pointed out in previous Annual Reports, there could be considerable differences between the value of imports actually received and cleared from the Customs in any time period and their value as reflected in the Customs entries, from which Customs data are derived, if there was a significant interval between the clearance of imports and the passing of the relative Customs entries. This consideration has relevance especially to government imports and to imports of rice, flour and sugar.

!• Foreign aid received in 1970 under the various commodity aid programmes amounted to Rs. 322.2 million. 3. For a detailed account of these movements vide pages 238.

The total volume of all exports (as measured by the Central Bank's Trade Indices base 1967=100) which had decreased by 5 per cent in 1969 increased by 4 per cent to 102 in 1970. The average price index of all exports which remained unchanged in 1969 increased marginally by 1 per cent to 118 in the year under review.

The aggregate volume index of all imports (Central Bank's Trade Indices base 1967=100) rose by 7 per cent in 1969 and decreased by 6 per cent to 102 in 1970. The volume indices for the major categories of imports reveal that in 1970 'intermediate goods' at 86 and 'investment goods' at 116, decreased by 17 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively, while 'consumer goods' at 106 rose by 14 per cent.

The average price of all imports in 1970 continued its rising trend and the index at 140 was 4 per cent higher than in 1969. The average price indices of 'intermediate' and investment goods' in 1970 rose by 9 per cent and 17 per cent to 136 and 148 respectively, while 'consumer goods' at 139 decreased marginally by 1 per cent.

Ceylon's commodity terms of trade (Bank's Index base 1967 a 100) which had deteriorated in the two preceding years continued to be adverse in 1970, decreasing to 84 from 88 in 1969.

While in 1969 the Customs data relating to imports of rice, flour and sugar overstated the Food Commissioner's actual imports of these commodities by Rs. 44 million, in 1970, Customs data overstated the Food Commissioner's imports by Rs. 18 million.

If the total imports for 1969 and 1970 (Customs data) are adjusted to reflect the actual import of tice, flour and sugar received by the Food Commi­ssioner, the value of total imports would be reduced from Rs. 2,543 million and

( 222 )

Rs. 2,313 million to Rs. 2,499million and Rs. 2,295 million, in 1969 and 1970 respectively. On the basis of import data so adjusted, the value of imports in 1970 fell short of the previous year's level by Rs. 204 million or 8 per cent.

On the basis of data adjusted for Food Commissioner's actual imports, the merchandise trade deficit for 1969 will be reduced from Rs. 627 million to Rs. 583 million and that for 1970 will be reduced from Rs. 280 million to Rs. 262 million.

2. Exports

The increase in export earnings of Rs. 117 million in 1970 was due largely to increases in export earnings from tea and other domestic exports. While export receipts from rubber and the three major coconut products also increased though less markedly, earnings from re-exports decreased marginally. Table 11 (J) 2 reveals the composition of exports and their relative percentage shares in the total export earnings.

Tea

Production

Tea production in 1970 at 468 million pounds was 16 million pounds lower than the output in 1969 and was the lowest recorded since 1962. When compared with 1968, production in 1970 was lower by 28 million pounds. The fall in production is attributed to the "lagged" effects of reduced fertilizer application in the plantations during the latter part of 1969, to adverse weather,

particularly heavy rains in the first and third quarters and to restricted cropping and better standards of manufacture in the second quarter of the year. The decrease in output was confined to high and medium-grown teas while the output of low-growns increased as seen in Table II (J) 3.

Exports

The volume of tea exported in 1970 at 460 million pounds increased by by 15 million pounds over that of 1969. The volume of tea exported in December, 1969 was affected by strikes in the Ports of Colombo and Trincomalee, the backlog of which may have affected the quantity exported in 1970. The expansion in export volume, in the face of a decrease in production was possible due to running down of tea stocks. Available data indicate that stocks of manu­factured tea in Ceylon decreased from 87 million pounds at the end of December, 1969 to 45 million pounds at the end of November, 1970.1

The quantity of tea offered for sale at the Colombo Auctions in 1970 de­creased by 14 million pounds to 373 million pounds, while the quantity shipped direct to the London Auctions increased by 3 million pounds to 91 million pounds. Through the medium of private sales 4 million pounds of tea were sold. The corresponding quantity for 1969 was 5 million pounds.

Exports by destination

The United Kingdom continued to be the principal customer for Ceylon tea, increasing her share by 4.5 per cent in 1970. As in the preceding year, the United States of America was the second largest buyer, while Australia, Iraq, and the Union of South Africa were the next most important buyers.

Colombo Auctions

The average nett price of all teas sold at the Colombo Auctions in 1970 was Rs. 1.63 per pound and was 10 cents or 6 per cent higher than in 1969. This increase was confined to High and Medium grown teas, while the Low-Growns remained unchanged at the preceding year's level. The Medium Growns at Rs. 1.58 per pound showed an increase of 18 cents and the High Growns at Rs. 1.92 per pound increased by 12 cents. The rise in tea prices which set in by middle of September 1969, continued through the first quarter of 1970 and recorded a fall at the end of the second quarter when the average nett price fell to Rs. 1.58 per pound. This was reflected both in High and Medium Grown teas when their average nett prices for the quarter dropped to Rs. 1.80 and Rs. 1.51 from Rs. 1.95 and Rs. 1.58 respectively recorded at the end of the first quarter. The Low Growns, however, remained at Rs. 1.37. This fall in the average nett price may be attributed to the seasonal decline in the quality of Dimbulla and Dickoya teas. It has been said that this season's crop was undoubtedly one of the most disappointing for many years and very little teas with marked seasonal character and flavour were available1. Compared with the second quarter of 1969, however, the High and Medium Growns showed substantial increases. While the High Growns rose by 23 cents and Medium Growns by 33 cents, the Low Growns rose by only 6 cents. The sharp price differential high­lighted here was due to the slump in tea prices in the second quarter of 1969. The improvement in the average nett price at Rs. 1.76 per pound in the third quarter of the year was due to the strong demand for select best liquoring

teas from the Uva district where record prices were realised for both B. O. P.s and B. O. P. Fanning grades during August1. A further factor responsible for the increase in price was the re-entry of USSR buyer to the Auctions. The average nett price for the fourth quarter at Rs. 1-56 per pound was lower by 20 cents and 8 cents per pound respectively, when compared with that of the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 1969. This decrease in the average nett price is attributed to a fall in the average prices of both High and Medium Grown teas by 44 cents and 21 cents per pound respectively as compared with the preceding quarter. The Low Growns, however, recorded an increase of 5 cents per pound. Table II (J) 6 provides data on production, exports and prices.

Domestic Consumption

Domestic consumption of tea during 1970 is estimated at 41.6 million pounds as against 40.6 million pounds in 1969. This was nearly 8.9 per cent of the total quantity produced in 1970.

London Auctions

The average price of all teas sold at the London Auctions in 1970 at 49.71d. per pound was 5.60 d. per pound higher than in 1969 and 2.08 d. per pound more than that in 1968. The price increase at this centre was shared by all countries. The factors which contributed towards the rise in prices in the London market in 1970 were, the reduced volume of tea sold at the London Auctions, particulatly of Indian and Ceylon origin; the incteased availability of better quality teas following the Mauiitius Tea Agieement wherein the major producing countries agreed to withold 90 million pounds of black tea expotts in 1970; the sharp decrease in the level of stocks up to August;1 and the slump in selling values witnessed in 1969 which depressed 1969 average price Table II (J) 8 provides data on quantities of tea sold at the London Auctions

The average price of all grades of Ceylon tea sold at the London Auctions in 1970 at 51.14d. per pound showed an increase of 2.63 d. per pound over that of 1969 and 1.84 d. over that of 1968. Ceylon tea, which in the two preceding years recorded the highest annual average price was replaced by Kenyan tea in 19702. The increase in the average price was shared by all thiee elevational

1. Tea stocks in the U.K which began declining in August 1969 continued to do so up to August 1970. This trend was reversed after August as tea shipments consigned to U.K. and temporarily diverted to continental ports because of the national dock strike began arriving thus leading to an improvement in the stock position and a consequent price decline towards the latter part of the year. 2. Wiiereas in 1969, the price differential between Ceylon teas (average of all grades) and Kenyan teas was 0-33 d. per pound in favour of Ceylon, in 1970 this position was reversed and the price differential was 1.83 d. in favour of Kenya.

categories. The largest increase was in the low grown category, whose price rose by 7.81 d. per pound. While the average price of medium growns increased by 3.39 d. per pound, that of high growns rose marginally by 0.84 d. per pound. The comparatively higher prices realised by medium and low growns in 1970 could be attributed to the fact that in 1969 their average prices were depressed due to the slump in selling values and to increased demand for such teas in 1970 following a sharp reduction in the level of stocks in the U.K.

Total tea production in the major producing countries in 1970 amounted to 1,670 million pounds; an increase of 52 million pounds over that of 1969.1

(East African data relate to the period January to November).

Instant Tea

The quantity of Instant tea manufactured in 1970 at 248,895 pounds showed a decrease of 51,677 pounds or 17.2 percent as compared with 1969.2

The output of Instant tea in 1968 was 297,022 lbs. Customs Returns record that 236,321 pounds of Instant tea valued at Rs. 2.5 million were exported in 1970. The corresponding figures for 1969 were 312,437 pounds valued at Rs. 3.9 mil­lion. Exports to the United Kingdom amounted to 154,937 pounds or 66 per cent of total exports, while exports to the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan and Australia were 27,598 pounds, 19,423 pounds and 18,073 pounds, respectively.

Packeted Tea Exports

The exports of tea in packets, which had shown marked increases in the two preceding years, expanded further by 1.9 million pounds to 17.0 million pounds in 1970. The value of packeted tea exports from Ceylon which had shown a steady increase since 1967 continued its upward trend in the year under review and increased by Rs. 4 3 million to Rs. 41-6 million. Around 75 per cent of packeted tea exports in 1970 were destined to Middle East countries. Libya was the largest buyer of packeted tea from Ceylon accounting for 11.8 million pounds valued at Rs. 26.8 million.

International Tea Consultation

At a meeting of the F.A.O. Consultative Committee on tea held in New Delhi in November 1970, it was decided to maintain for 1971, the 1970 global expott figure of 1,311 million pounds. The finalization of quotas for indi­vidual countries was deferred for the next meeting to be held in Rome. There was general agreement that both importing and exporting countries should work together to achieve long term measures to stabilise tea prices.

Consideration was given by the committee to ways of promoting higher consumption of tea and the necessity for talks with importing countries for a reduction of high tariffs and export duties on tea. Exporting countries were agreed that any inctease in export supplies should just match the rise in world demand so that remunerative and equitable prices could be maintained. A decision on these matters was postponed for the next meeting.

Rubber Production

Production of Rubber which increased marginally by 4.6 million pounds in 1969, expanded sharply in 1970 by 18.4 million pounds or 5.5 per cent. Although tapping opetations were intetrupted intermittently as a result of inter-monsoonal showers, weather conditions, in general, during 1970 were favourable for the production of rubber. Another contributory factot to the increase in produc­tion was the coming into maturity of more replanted acreages in 1970.

The production of sheet rubber at 211.0 million pounds showed an increase of 16.4 million pounds or 8.5 per cent over that of 1969 and consequently con­tributed in a large measure to the increase in total production in 1970. Crepe rubber production, too, expanded though modestly by 2 million pounds from 136.3 million pounds in 1969 to 138.3 million pounds in the year under review.

Consumption

The local consumption of natural rubber at,8.3 million pounds or 2.4 per cent of total ptoducion in 1970 showed an increase of 0.5 million pounds over that of the ptevious year.

Exports

The volume of tubber exported in 1970 recorded an appreciable increase of 39.4 million pounds or 12.5 per cent when compared with 1969.1 Shipments of rubber from the Port of Colombo moved smoothly in 1970 except in January when shippers experienced considerable inconvenience due to the prevailing strike situation

The increase in volume of rubber exports was confined largely to sheet rubber which rose by 42.0 million pounds or 24 per cent over that of 1969.

Market Price Movements

The average price of RSS No. 1 Sheet Rubber in the Colombo market which was Rs. 1.05 per pound in January 1970 decreased sharply to Rs. 0.83 per pound by October 1970 in keeping with the trend of prices in the international markets. The market buoyed up in November when the price moved up by 5 cents per pound to Rs. 0.88 per pound, following improved prices in internatio­nal markets, when the People's Republic of China resumed purchases. The annual average price of RSS No. 1 Sheet rubber in 1970 at Rs. 0.91 per pound represented a marked decrease of 13 cents per pound or 12.5 per cent over that of 1969. The Colombo Market price of Latex Crepe No. 1 followed the trends of RSS No. 1 with an average price of Rs. 1.09 per pound in January 1970 falling to Rs. 0.92 by October. The annual average price of Latex Crepe No. IX at Rs. 1.12 per pound showed a decrease of 4 cents per pound as compared with that of the previous year.

In the International markets, in contrast to 1969, prices of natural rubber in 1970 followed a steady downward trend and by October fell to 18 d. per pound, the lowest price recorded in London since May, 1968. The fall in prices in 1970 has been attributed mainly to the general decrease in consumption

Exports by Destinantion

The People's Republic or China continued to be the principal buyer of rubber in 1970 accounting for 187 million pounds (53 per cent of total rubber exports) compared with 158 millon pounds in 1969 (50 per cent of total rubber expotts).

Data on rubber exports by destination for 1969 and 1970 are presented in Table II (J) 10, along with respective percentage shares.

in the face of increased production and stocks in the East. The absence of the People's Republic of China from the market from February and the rumour that the U. S. was going to resume sales of stockpiled rubber were also factors which contributed to the decline in price. The threat of stockpile releases hung over the market diminishing confidence until an official announcement was made in mid-May by the General Services Administration confirming stockpile releases at the rate of 7000 tons per month. However, with a view to arresting the decline in market prices, which had reached low levels and aiding producer countries, stockpile releases were suspended in mid-September.

The People's Republic of China showed only a minimal interest in the market until November, when she resumed purchases on a small scale. This resulted in slight improvements in prices in November and December.

The reduced consumption of natural rubber in the year under review was due mainly to the unsettled labour situation in the U. S. rubber industry, the Dunlop sttike in the U. K. and a lack of buying interest and fresh orders.

In sum, the annual average price of RSS No. 1 sheet rubber in the London market at 20.3 pence per pound decreased by 4.8 pence per pound or 15 per cent as compared with the corresponding price of 1969. In the Singapore maket, the annual average f. o. b. price of sheet rubber at 55.91 Strait cents per pound represented a more marked decline of 13.80 Strait cents per pound or 20 per cent over that of the previous year.

Rubber Producers' Conference

In August 1970, Malaysia, Indonesia, Ceylon, Thailand, Singapore and South Vietnam grouped themselves into an Association of Rubber Producing Countries (A.N.R.P.C). The inaugural meeting was held in KualaLumpur in October 1970

( 231 )

and the Malaysian proposal calling for a joint marketing system to enable stable and uniform prices for rubber in each producing country was accepted unanimously.

Coconut Products

In the world markets the increased demand for edible fats and oils and the continued shortage of supplies resulted in their average prices in 1970 rising to levels well above those of 1969. Prices of lauric oils were influenced by typhoon damage to coconut plantations in the Philippines, which wiped out prospects of increased production and resulted in better prices towards the end of the year.

Colombo Market

In 1970, the prices of the three major coconut products in the Colombo market followed the same trend as in the international markets. While the first half of 1970 witnessed a general decline in the average prices of copra and coconut oil as compared with those of 1969, the price of desiccated coconut, however, decreased only in the first two months. Copra prices too improved in March and April following exchange reforms in the Philippines. In the second half of 1970, however, the prices of copra, coconut oil and desiccated coconut recorded marked increases over those of 1969.

Copra

The Department of Commodity Purchase, entered the copra auctions in November, 1969 with a view to stimulating prices which had reached very low levels at that time and continued to participate in the Auctions till the end of May, 1970. The average price of copra at Rs. 235.49 per candy in May followed a downward drift till October 1970 when prices moved up on better demand and settled at Rs. 251.36 per candy in December 1970. The annual average price of copra in the Colombo market at Rs. 247.56 per candy in 1970 represen­ted an increase of Rs. 9 68 per candy or 4 per cent when compared with the corresponding price in 1969.

The total quantity of copra sold at the Ceylon Coconut Board during 1970 amounted to 442,263 candies (110.6 thousand tons) as against 530,462 candies (132.6 thousand tons) disposed of during the previous year.

Coconut Oil

The average price of coconut oil in the Colombo market during the first half of 1970 followed a downward trend to reach a price of Rs. 1,369.25 per ton in June, 1970. The market showed signs of buoyancy around September resulting from the entty of India into the Ceylon coconut oil market after a lapse of over seven years. The annual average price of coconut oil at Rs. 1,503.71 per ton reflected an appreciable increase of Rs. 49-24 per ton or 3 per cent over that of the preceding year.

Desiccated Coconut

The Ministry of Commerce and Trade introduced a 'floor-price' scheme for desiccated coconut with effect from 5th January 1970 designed, in the main, to obtain a reasonable price for producers of desiccated coconut in

( 232 )

Ceylon. Initially, the price of desiccated coconut was fixed at Rs. 0.75 per pound by the Commissioner of Commodity Purchase, in consultation with the desiccated coconut millers, shippers and the Ceylon Coconut Board. The floor price scheme was, however, abandoned later and was superseded by an alternative scheme with effect from 3rd May, 1970, when the Ceylon Coconut Board formulated a procedure of publishing the price of desiccated coconut payable by shippers to the millers of desiccated coconut.

The average price of desiccated coconut which stood at Rs. 0.59 per pound

in May, 1970 increased to Rs. 0.66 per pound in December, 1970. The annual

average price at Rs. 0.64 per pound showed an increase of 6 cents per pound

or 10 per cent over the corresponding price of the previous year.

Exports

In 1970, the total volume of exports of the three major coconut products (as measured by the Central Bank's Trade Indices 1967=100) decreased by 3 per cent as compared with a decline of 18 per cent recorded in 1969. In terms of their nut equivalent, the total volume of coconut exports during the year 1970 amounted to 874 million nuts as against a total volume of 896 million nuts in 1969. Export volumes of copra and desiccated coconut decreased by 20 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, while exports of coconut oil moved up by 30 thousand cwt., or 3.5 per cent over that of the previous year. The decrease in the total volume of exports of the three major coconut products was more than offset by appreciable increases in the average f. o. b. prices recorded by all three products during 1970. Consequently, total export earnings from the three major coconut products at Rs. 237 million reflects a note-worthy increase of 7 per cent over that of 1969.

Data on export volumes and export prices of the three major coconut products for the period 1966-70, are presented in table II (J) 12.

Exports by Destination

Copra

India which has been the principal customer for Ceylon copra in the past few years accounted for as much as 64 per cent of the total copra exports in 1970 as against 52 per cent in 1969. Pakistan, the second largest importer of Ceylon copra absorbed 82 thousand cwt. or 27 per cent of the total volme of copra exported during 1970. Exports of copra to the U.S.S.R. at 20 thousand cwt. reflected a maked decrease of 58 thousand cwt. or 74 per cent as compared with the volume expotted to that country during 1969.

Coconut oil

The U.S.S.R. continued to be the largest buyer of Ceylon coconut oil accounting for 255 thousand cwt. or 22 per cent of the total volume exported in 1970. The People's Republic of China absorbed 205 thousand cwt. or 18 per cent as compared with 274 thousand cwt. or 25 per cent in 1969. The next important buyers of coconut oil in 1970 were Pakistan, German Democratic Republic and Italy. Desiccated Coconut

The United Kingdom, the principal customer of Ceylon desiccated coconut accounted for 348 thousand cwt. or 36 per cent of total exports as against 332 thousand cwt. or 33 per cent in 1969. The volume of desiccated coconut exports to the German Federal Republic in 1970 at 109 thousand cwt. represen­ted a marked decrease of 19 thousand cwt. or 15 per cent as compared with the volume exported during the previous year. The German Democratic Republic, Netherlands and the Union of South Africa accounted for 75 thousand cwt. 67 thousand cwt. and 42 thousand cwt. respectively of total exports of desicca­ted coconut in 1970. Other Domestic Exports

The total value of other domestic exports in 1970 at Rs. 198 million recorded a substantial increase of Rs.37 million or 23 per cent as compared with that of 1969. The enhancement in export earnings was solely the result of an expansion of 3 per cent in the volume of exports of these products, the effect of which was to some extent offset by a fall of 2 per cent in their average export price (Bank indices).

The stimulus to higher export earnings from other domestic exports can largely be associated with the continued operation of the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme introduced in May, 1968. The premium continued to be 55 per cent of the foreign exchange earned in rupee terms. Exports of Naptha to Japan, a by-product of the Petroleum refining plant used in the manu­facture of fertilizers, amounted to Rs. 9 million and was a further factor which contributed to the higher level of export earnings realised by other domestic exports in 1970. With a view to siphoning off a greater slice of the unusually large profit margins accruing to the exporters of natural graphite, the export duty on this product was raised to 50 per cent of the true f. o. b. Colombo value in October 1970 from the earlier rate of 25 per cent of the true f. o. b. Colombo value. As pointed out in the Annual Report for 1969, an enhanced flow of ex­ports resulting from incentives provided by the FEEC scheme can be expected

only after a lapse of a sufficiently long period and that too provided, action is coordinated and oriented to eliminate the bottlenecks impeding production, Table II (J) 13, provides data on export volumes, export values and avetage f. o. b. prices of selected minor export commodities.

Table II (J) 13 covers approximately 76 per cent of the total value of expotts of the group 'other domestic expotts' recorded for 1970, as compared with 90 per cent in 1969. The reduced coverage in 1970 could be attributed to rhe sharp increase in the value of exports of miscellaneous goods from Rs. 1. 6 millon in 1969 to Rs. 20. 7 million in 1970, which item is excluded from this table. Table II (J) 14 provides data on Colombo market ptice movements.

A crop diversification subsidy scheme under the Tea and Rubber Subsidy Acts for uneconomic tea and rubber lands under which alternative crops were to be cultivated in these lands was introduced in June, 1970. Under this scheme co­conut, cocoa, pasture, timber, cardamoms, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, passion fruit, pineapples, tobacco and oil palm cultivators in uneconomic tea and rubber lands of a minimum acreage specified, were to be paid varying rates of subsidy1 per acre. These subsidies were outright gtants to be paid in instalments to the cultivator. In addition a scheme to supplement the expenditure through loans obtainable from the Ceylon State Mortgage Bank is also in operation.

The Food Commissioner's actual aggregate imports of rice, flour and sugar

in 1970 at Rs. 730 million increased sharply, resulting in an enhanced foreign

exchange outlay of Rs. 147 million as compared with 1969. Whereas, the value

of his imports of rice at Rs. 353 million and sugar at Rs. 152 million exceeded

the preceding year's imports as recorded by him by Rs. 142 million and Rs. 10

million respectively, the value of flour imports at Rs. 225 million registered a

fall of Rs. 5 million.

As pointed ovit earlier, the substantial decrease of Rs. 230 million in the

value of impotts in 1970 (Customs data) when adjusted for the over valuation

of Food Commissioner's imports is reduced to Rs. 204 million.

The sharp increase in the value of imports of rice and the consequent increase in the foreign exchange outlay in 1970 was solely the result of a sharp expansion of 266 thousand tons or 102 per cent in the volume of imports, the effect of which was partly offset by a fall of Rs. 140 per ton in the average c. & {. price. The doubling of the volume of rice imports in the year under review was due mainly to the decision of the Government, to increase to two measures, the subsidised weekly ration of rice issued to the consumers. The decrease in the average c. &. f. price of rice was in keeping with the ttend of lower prices which prevailed in the international markets and was the result of good hatvests and consequent increases in supplies in most rice producing countries.

Flour

The decrease of Rs. 5 million in the value of imports of flour is accounted for by a contraction of 19 thousand tons or 5 per cent in the quantity imported, the effect of which was to some extent offset by a rise of Rs. 20 per ton in the average c. ck f. price. The increase in average c. &. f. price of wheat flour was due both to a shortfall in production of wheat in most producing countries and to a rise in freight charges.

Sugar

The increase of Rs. 10 million in the value of imports of sugat in 1970 as compared with the year 1969 was due wholly to an increase of Rs. 174 per ton or 38 per cent in the avetage c. &. f- price. The volume of imports, however, con­tracted by 68 thousand tons. The rise in the average c. & f. price of sugar was the result of higher prices that prevailed in the international markets following shortfalls in export quotas under the International Sugar Agreement and the delays in the re-distribution of short falls in export quotas.

Customs Entries and Actual Imports of Rice, Flour and Sugar

( 239 )

Table II (J) 17 provides a classification of imports by major categories and commodities, or groups of commodites, as given in the Customs Returns.

The decrease in the value of imports of Rs. 230 million (Customs data) for 1970 has been concentrated in the 'intermediate' and 'investment goods' categories, while imports of 'consumer goods' registetei an increase. The significant move­ments within the three groups have been as follows.

Consumer Goods

The increase of Rs. 76 million in the value of imports of 'consumer goods' has been confined to 'food and drink' and 'textile' sub groups, while imports df 'othet consumer goods' decreased by Rs. 19 million. The value of imports of 'food and drink' items at Rs. 1,069 million in 1970 revealed an inrease of Rs. 93 million due mainly to amounts recorded in Customs entries relating to imports of rice, flour and sugar increasing in the aggtegate by Rs. 121 million. Import expenditure on 'milk and milk products' too increased by Rs. 3 million. The value of imports of 'textiles' showed a slight inctease of Rs. 2 million over the preceding year.

Intermediate Goods

In the 'intermediate goods' category, the value of impotts of 'petroleum products' amounted to Rs. 58 million and revealed a sharp reduction in import expenditure of Rs. 98 million as compared with 1969. The decrease in value was due solely to a sharp contraction of 261 million gallons in the quantity imported,1 the effect of which was partly offset by a rise of 18 cents per gallon in the average c-i-f- price. The volume of petroleum products imported in 1970 amounted to 96 million gallons and their average c.i.f. price per gallon was 61 cents. The reduction in the volume imported couM be attributed to the fact that imports were mainly confined to crude oil to be refined at th: Petroleum Corporation's refinery and to a large stock of the 1969 imports being held in bond at the Port of Colombo. The higher c.i.f. price resulted from increased purchases from Middle East countries, where market prices were higher than in 1969. Import expenditures on 'chemical elements and compounds' and 'paper and paperboard' decreased by Rs. 10 million each in 1970 while those on 'yarn and thread' decreased sharply by Rs. 39 million. Import outlays on 'fertilizers' in 1970, however, registered an increase of Rs. 15 million over 1969. The increase in the value of these imports was due both to an expansion of 45 thousand tons in the quantity imported and a rise of Rs. 8 per ton in the average c.i.f. price.

Investment Goods

The contraction by Rs. 154 million in the value of imports of this categoty, was confined to the sub-groups 'transport equipment' and 'machinery and equipment'. Imports of 'building materials' however, recorded an increase. The

Customs data vary from figures supplied by the Petroleum Corporation PS the former included imports of bunker fuel oil by the Oil Companies- In 1970, there were no imports of refined petroleum products by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. The requirements of crude oil for refinement at the Petroleum Corporation's refinery was cleared from stocks imported in 1969 and held in bond at the Port of Colombo.

unusually large imports of 'transport equipment' in 1969 was for the Railway Depattment's dieselisation programme, an aircraft for Air Ceylon (The Trident) and buses for the Ceylon Transport Board.

4. Developments in the Port of Colombo

The total volume of cargo handled by the Port of Colombo during 1970 at 2,768,929 shipping tons, registered a sharp fall of 257,272 shipping tons as compated with 1969. The decrease in the volume of cargo handled was due to a reduced volume of imports in 1970, strikes in the Port of Colombo during the first quarter of 1970 and interruption to work caused by rain in the second and third quarters. While the volume of export cargo declined by 35,016 shipping tons that of imports decteased more sharply by 222,256 shipping tons as compared with 1969.

Particulars of the tonnage handled by the Port of Colombo in each quarter of 1970 as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1969 are given in Table II (J) 18.

The Annual Report for 1967 referred to the freight surcharges imposed following the closure of the Suez Canal in June, 1967 and the devaluation of the pound sterling in November, 1967.1 These changes continued to be in operation in 1969 with certain changes in the basic freight rates.2 The year 1970 witnessed general increases in freight rates ranging from 5 per cent to 12^ per cent.

The following are particulars of the general increases made in freight rates during 1970J-

(i) Ceylon/U.S.A. Conference

1-1-1970 _ A general freight increase of 5 per cent to U.S.A. and Atlantic Ports.

(ii) Ceylon/Australia Conference

(iii) Ceylon/New Zealand Conference 1-4 -1970 — A general freight increase of 1\ percent to New-Zealand Ports.

(vi) Elletman &. Bucknall Steamship Co. Ltd.

1-4-1970 — A general freight increase of 5 per cent to Canada and Atlantic Ports.

(v) Ceylon/U.K. and Continental Conference

1-9-1970 — A general freight increase of 12J per cent to U.K., Continental and Mediterranean Ports. The freight increase on tea, however, was limited to 7|per cent only. In 1969, reference was made to the narrowing of the differential in freight between Colombo and Calcutta. The reduced rate of increase referred to above narrowed by a further 5 per cent the long standing differential in freight rates for tea from the two Ports.

5. Pattern of Trade

In 1970, the value of Ceylon's exports to the principal monetary areas and regions showed increases of varying magnitude. The value of imports from these areas and regions with the exception of those from the E.C.A.F.E. region regis­tered decreases. The pattern of trade by principal monetary areas and regions is given in Table II (3) 19.

An expansion in the turnover of Ceylon's trade with the People's Republic of China took place during the year 1970. Ceylon's exports to China increased by 5 per cent to Rs. 252 million, while imports expanded by

Rs. 7 million or 3 per cent to Rs. 289 million. The trade deficit at Rs. 42 mil­lion in 1969 was reduced to Rs. 37 million in 1970. Ceylon's trade tutnover with the People's Republic of China in 1970 was Rs. 541 million andaccounted

for 12.4 per cent of the total trade turnover of the country. This represented an expansion of approximately 1 per cent over that of 1969,

Rubber continued to be the principal export product during 1970 and exports rose by Rs. 17.5 million or by 8 per cent to Rs. 230.5 million. This increase was solely the result of an expansion in the volume of rubber exported. The total volume of rubbet exports during 1970 was 186.8 million pounds as compared with 157.1 million pounds in 1969, an increase of 29.7 million pounds. Coconut oil exports showed a contraction of Rs. 7.2 million when compared with 1969 due both to a decrease in the volume and to a fall in the avetage f.o.b.

price. The volume of Coconut oil expotts in 1970 was 10.3 thousand tons (as compared with 13.7 thousand tons in 1969) while the average f.o.b. price stood

The turnover of Ceylon's trade in 1970 with the U. S. S. R. and Eastern Europe contracted by Rs. 57 million or 13.7 per cent when compared with 1969, mainly on account of reduced imports from this region. Exports, on the other hand, at Rs. 174 million expanded by Rs. 9 million or 5.5 percent over 1969. Correspondingly, the trade deficit of Rs. 11 million represented an improvement of Rs. 75 million from the position at the end of 1969. Ceylon's trade turnover of Rs. 359 millon or 8.2 per cent in 1970 was 3.8 per cent lower than in 1969.

A commodity classification of trade with the U. S. S. R. and Eastern Europe is provided in Table II (J) 23.

The U. S. S. R. continued to be Ceylon's principal trading partner in this region in 1970 accounting for Rs. 82.3 million or 47 per cent of the total value of exports. In 1969, however, this accounted for 54 per cent. Exports to the U. S. S. R. contracted by Rs. 7.2 million when compared with that of the preceding year, mainly due to reduced exports of rubber and coconut products. The value of tea exports, however, increased by Rs. 3.8 million over the last year.

Poland was the next customer of importance in this region. She accounted for about 23 per cent of total exports to this group of countries. The value of exports to Poland at Rs. 40.7 million in 1970 represented an expansion of Rs. 13.5 million or approximately 50 per cent over that of 1969. Rubber, which has been the principal export to Poland for the past few years increased appreciably by Rs. 11.5 million or 62.5 per cent.

The total exports in 1970 to the German Democratic Republic increased by Rs. 6.0 million or 44 per cent to Rs. 19.6 million. Exports of coconut oil to G. D. R. were Rs. 9.4 million showing a marked increase of Rs. 5.8 million or 133 per cent over the value in 1969. Although the volume of exports of desiccated coconut to G. D. R. declined by 21.7 thousand cwt., the value of exports in 1970 increased as a result of a significant rise in the average f. o. b. price which stood at Rs. 1.10 per pound as compared with Rs. 0.81 per pound in 1969.

In 1970, Rumania accounted for about 11 per cent of the total exports to this group of countries. The total value of exports at Rs. 19.0 million remained stable as compared with 1969. The value of rubber exports to Rumania at Rs. 16.9 million expanded by Rs. 1.0 million on account of an improved average f. o. b. price for rubber.

Poland, U. S. S. R., Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, were the principal suppliers of imports from the region during 1970, and jointly accounted for 80 per cent of the total value of imports which were Rs. 185.3 million.

The total value of imports from Poland in 1970 were Rs. 48.4 million and accounted for 26 per cent of the imports from the region, as compared with a share of 9 per cent of the total value of imports in 1969. The value of imports of sugar from Poland during 1970 increased markedly by Rs. 28.7 million to Rs. 36.4 million. The value of textile imports, however, decreased by Rs. 4-1 million. The balance of trade with Poland in 1970 showed a deficit of Rs. 7.7 million as against a surplus of Rs. 3.8 million in 1969.

Imports from the U. S. S. R. in 1970 contracted by Rs. 10.9 million to Rs. 39.8 million. A decrease in the value of imports of tea chests by Rs. 5.0 million, cement by Rs. 2.6 million, and petroleum products by Rs. 3.3 million contributed to the contraction of total import values during 1970. The balance of trade with the U. S. S. R. showed a surplus of Rs. 42.5 million in 1970 as compared with a surplus of Rs. 38.8 million in 1969.

Imports from Yugoslavia, declined by Rs. 20.5 million to Rs. 30.5 million in 1970. As shown in Table II (J) 23, imports of sugar at Rs. 27.0 million decreased by Rs. 18.5 million or 41 per cent, when compared with that of 1969, while imports of machinery too, contracted during the year under review. The balance of trade with Yugoslavia showed a deficit of Rs. 26.1 million in 1970.

The total value of imports from Czechoslovakia in 1970 due largely to the increased imports of sugar, increased markedly by Rs. 17.1 million from Rs. 13.3 million in 1969 to Rs. 30.4 million. The balance of trade with Czechoslovakia in 1970 showed a deficit of Rs. 26.9 million as against a deficit of Rs. 9.7 million in 1969.

The value of imports of sugar from the region as a whole, at Rs. 109.1 million was 64 per cent of the total value of sugar imported from all sources. Likewise, the value of cement imports from the above group of countries was 40 per cent of the total value of such imports.

6. Developments in Commercial Policy

Export Control

From February 24, 1970 the minimum price per cwt; of mattress fibre delivered at shipper's .stores was increased to Rs. 13.50 and that for all other grades of fibre excluding mattress fibre was fixed at Rs. 32.00. (Ceylon Govern­ment Gazette Extraordinary No. 14,894/4 of February 24, 1970).

Import Control

The Import Control arrangements which were brought into operation in May 1968, continued to be in force up to August 4, 1970. With effect from that date the system of Open General Licences was discontinued and all goods hitherto imported under Open General Licences were brought under a scheme of trade quotas.1 However, all such imports were subject to the surrender of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates. As a prelude to the abolition of OGL, all

( 249 )

sales of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates were suspended with effect from May 29, 1970 except where FEECs were required to retire maturing import bills or to remit foreign exchange against permits issued by the Controller of Exchange.

With regard to approved and registered industrialists, the Ministry of Industries and Scientific Research continued to issue their requirements on actual user licences.

7. Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates Scheme

The Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates Scheme introduced in May, 1968 was in operation in 1970. The price of foreign exchange entitlement certificates continued to be Rs. 55 per certificate of a face value of Rs. 100.

Following the announcement made in the Budget Speech for the financial year 1970-71 imports of books and periodicals, two wheel tractors, implements and spares and cotton yarn and raw cotton were transferred to Category 'A' and were exempted from FEECs. At the same time, imports of sugar, maize, imports of Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation, the Ceylon Transport Board and the Ceylon Electricity Board were transferred to Category 'B' and subject to the surrender of FEECs.

8. Tariffs Export Duties 25.10. 19701

Export duty on natural graphite was increased from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the true f. o. b. Colombo value.

Import Duties 26. 10. 19702

In order to rationalise and simplify the import tariff structure with effect from October 26, 1970 the existing import duties were revised and re-grouped into a small number of easily identifiable duty rate ranges. The new groupings were intended to foster economic growth by permitting the import of raw materials and other essential intermediate and investment goods required for development at low rates of duty while providing adequate protection to domestic industry and agriculture and helping in the progressive substitu­tion of imports.

The new tariff schedule standatdises import duties into six basic duty rate ranges. Basic consumer items that enter in to the cost of living are duty free, while basic industrial raw materials and important items of machinery for agriculture and industry carry nominal rates of duty. The standard rate of duty has been fixed at 60 per cent. The duty rates above this standard rate are designed to provide protection to domestic production and to induce the

manufacture of components locally and promote new ventures in fields with potential for future development. The high rates of duty are confined almost wholly to non-essential and luxury items.
