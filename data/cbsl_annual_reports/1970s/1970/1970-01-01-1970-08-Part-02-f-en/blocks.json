The excess from these sources after meeting the Budget deficit helped to augment cash balances (including for\u00adeign aid counterpart funds) by Rs. 26 million.

This increase, which occurred despite decreases of Rs. 50 million and Rs. 58 million in recurrent expenditure and captial expenditure respectively, was mainly the result of advance account payments amounting to Rs. 201 million, not provided for in the original estimates for the year. On the other hand, total revenue, was also Rs. 98 million less than originally anticipated. Consequently, the Budget deficit showed an increase of Rs. 191 million over the originally estimated figure. Towards financing this deficit the domestic market borrowing contributed Rs. 358 million more than originally forecast while there was a shortfall of Rs. 163 million in the expected foreign finance. Adminis\u00adtrative borrowings of Rs. 22 million not originally anticipated at Budget time together with the sharp increase in domestic market borrowing which more than offset the shortfall in foreign finance, helped to bridge the Budget deficit as well as to augment the cash balances of the Government by Rs. 26 million.",

Although the amount of gross foreign resources available in 1969/70 declined by Rs. 87 million compared with that of the previous year, it still contributed 29 per cent, towards financing the Budget deficit of the year. In the last five years gross foreign resources utilized for budgetary purposes was Rs. 1,422 million as compared with Rs. 418 million in the preceding five year period 1960/61 to 1964/65. Moreover, in 1970/71 a record Rs. 638 million (consisting of Rs. 525 million of commodity aid and Rs. 113 million of project aid) is expected from foreign sources to help finance the Budget deficit. The increased reliance on foreign finance for budgetary purposes is also reflected in the progressive increase in the foreign debt component of the public debt ouuianding (net) from 10 per cent, in 1960/61 to 21 per cent, in 1969/70.",

On the other hand, the inclusion of the revenue from FEECs payable on government imports has tended to inflate the figures of Government revenue in 1969/70 and the original estimates for 1970/71.

Taxes on production and expenditure contributed a little over two-thirds of the total Government revenue in 1969/70. The increase in revenue in 1969/70 over the previous financial year was mainly on account of higher receipts from income tax (Rs. 93 million), turnover tax (Rs.136 million), sale of FEECs (Rs. 161 million), export duties (Rs. 27 million), and profits and dividends from State Corporations (Rs.20 million). On the otherhand, there were offsetting decreases mainly in revenue from import duties (Rs.154 million), profits from food sales 1 and from gross receipts of Government Electrical Undertakings (Rs. 113 million). Receipts from the turnover taxes have more than doubled over the previous financial year while receipts from the sale of FEECs continued to increase compensating the declining trend in import duty collections.",

The major contributories to this decline are turnover tax (Rs. 35 million), import duties (Rs. 18 million), sale of FEECs (Rs. 94 million) and the decline in the revenue from the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings (Rs. 136 million). The effect of the above shortfalls was substantially offset by exesses in revenue from income tax (Rs.

Ill million over the original estimates for the year were due to several factors. Firstly, a sum of Rs. 60 million was collected in advance from corporations and a few selected companies during 1969/70. Secondly, the better economic conditions had resulted in an increased trade income. Thirdly, additional revenue was collected through investigations carried out in certain trades where large scale tax evasion was suspected. In addition, better returns were submitted by a good number of tax payers whose affairs had been previously investigated. Finally, there was a widening of the tax net by the addition of new tax payers.",

Of the Rs. 425 million anticipated in 1970/71, Rs 100 million is to be collected in the form of tax arrears conse\u00adquent to the demonetisation of the Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 notes. Thus, after allowing for this additional revenue, the original estimates for 1970/71 forecast a slightly reduced revenue from income tax as compared with the original estimates for 1969/70. Apart from this difference being accounted for by normal variations, this may also be due to the traditional caution exercised in forecasting such revenue. It is noteworthy that the actual collection of income tax has consistently exceeded the original forecasts in the last few years.",

The receipts, however, were Rs. 35 million lower than the original estimate for 1969/70. In 1970/71, receipts from the turnover tax are expected to be Rs. 294 million, thus contributing Rs. 47 million more to the Government revenue than in the previous financial year. The share of turnover tax in total Government revenue has thus progressively increased from 3 per cent, in 1967/68 to slightly over 6 per cent, in 1969/70 and is expected to increase still further to 7 per cent, in 1970/71.",

    "text": "The increased receipts from turnover tax in 1969/70, as compared with the previous year, were principally due to the introduction of the turnover tax on the manufacture of petroleum products, the inclusion of a number of items like the manufacture of cigarettes which were previously exempted from this tax, the lowering of the exemption limit of turnover tax from Rs. 100,000 to Rs- 75,000 and an upward revision of rates in respect of some items.1 It was also due to the higher turnover resulting from a higher level of business activity. The introduc\u00adtion of the turnover tax on petroleum products was effected along with the virtual elimination of the imports of such products and the abolition of the import duty on crude and base oils. The shortfall in actual receipts as compared with the original estimates was mainly on account of the turnover tax payment of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation for the last quarter of 1969/70 falling outside the financial year- The late commencement of production by the Petroleum Refinery, too, contributed to this shortfall. The further enhancement of revenue expected from turnover tax in 1970/71 is principally on account of the upward revision of rates on a number of items.2",

It, nevertheless, showed an excess of Rs. 11 million over the original estimates. The fall was mainly on account of slightly reduced receipts from tobacco tax and tea tax. The excess of Rs.ll million over the originally estimated revenue for 1969/70 from this source was mainly on account of a higher receipt of Rs. 11 million from tea tax collections and Rs. 2 million from other tax receipts, which were offset slightly by a lower receipt of Rs. 2 million from tobacco tax. The fall of Rs. 2 million from tobacco tax was mainly due to a decline in the sale of cigarettes and pipe tobacco. The increase in the ad-valorem tea tax receipts was mainly due to the better than anti\u00adcipated tea prices that prevailed in the London and Colombo Auctions.",

    "text": "Revenue from export duties increased by Rs. 27 million in 1969/70 as compared with the previous year. This increase was accounted for by increased duty collections from minor exports (Rs. 19 million), coconuts (Rs. 7 million) and rubber (Rs. 6 million), partly offset by a decrease in duties on tea (Rs. 6 million). The considerable increase in duties collected on minor exports (col\u00adlections were more than double that of the previous year) was mainly the result of subjecting, during 1969/70, some duty free minor exports like cinnamon chips, citronella oil and graphite to ad-valorem duties ranging from 10 per cent, to 40 per cent. The increased collections from coconut exports were mainly on account of the higher prices for Philippine's copra at the London Auctions (on which the sliding scale of duty is based) and an increase in the volume of coconut oil export. Except for the minor item of fresh nuts in this group, the revenue from all three major coconut exports of copra, coconut oil and desiccated coconut increased. The increase in the duties collected from rubber was primarily the result of an increase in the export volume of 31 million pounds (an increase of 10 per cent.), partly offset by a decline in the rubber prices in the Singapore market (on which the ad-valorem duties on rubber are based) particularly during the last quarter of the financial year when the volume of exports was high. It was also partly due to the fact that the bills of entry relating to the previous year's shipments were passed during 1969/70. The duties collected on tea exports decreased mainly on account of a decrease of 30 million pounds, (a decrease of 6 per cent.) in the volume of exports, and also due to a slight increase in the relative share of packeted tea in total tea exports.",

    "text": "When compared with original Budget estimates, the export duty revenue showed an excess of Rs. 29 million. This excess was the net effect of excesses of Rs. 29 million from rubber, Rs. 13 million from coconuts and Rs. 1 million from minor exports, partly offset by a shortfall of Rs. 13 million from tea. The sharp increase in rubber duty collections was mainly on account of a better than expected increase in the volume of rubber exports, referred to above. The increase in duties from coconut exports were primarily the result of the higher prices for copra at the London Auctions and the consequent increases in the ad-valorem duties. The decline in the revenue from tea was mainly due to the less than anticipated volume of tea exports and an increase in the relative share of packeted tea in total exports.",

The enhanced current expenditure in 1969/70 includes the additional payments on account of the consolidation of salaries and wages of Government employees and a portion of the FEEC expenditure of Government Departments partly offset by the effect of the conversion of the Electrical Depart\u00adment into a public corporation (which explains the substantial reduction in the gross payments of trading enterprises). In the financial year 1970/71, the estimated increase in current expenditure is Rs. 159 million or 6 per cent.",

    "text": "The capital expenditure of Government Departments in the year under review amounted to Rs. 518 million showing a decline of Rs. 8 million or 2 per cent, over thai of the previous year. This decline was mainly on account of a fall of Rs. 19 million in expenditure on economic services, partly offest by increases of Rs. 3 million on civil administration and Rs. 8 million on social services. The decline in the expenditure on economic services was mainly on account of a fall of Rs. 36 million on power (which as explained earlier was due to the conversion of the Electrical Department into a Board) and Rs. 7 million on trade partly offest by increases of Rs. 5 million on agriculture and irrigation, Rs. m.iron on manufacture and mining and Rs. 15 million on communication. The increase of Rs. 8 million on social services comprise increases of Rs. 9 million on education, and Rs. 1 million on health, partly offest by a decline of Rs. 2 million on housing.",

The bulk of the increase in the capital expenditure of Government Departments is mainly on account of a provision of Rs. 200 million under the Employment Programme. The increase in capital expenditure on social services is mainly on account of enhanced provision of Rs. 28 million on education, of Rs. 9 million on health, of Rs 16 million on housing and of Rs. 29 million on other social servces. The increase of Rs. 171 million in the expenditure on economic services comprises increases of Rs. 78 million on agriculture and irrigation, of Rs. 17 million on fisheries, of Rs. 8 million on manufacture and mining, of Rs. 27 million on trade and of Rs. 44 million on communication, partly offset by a decrease of Rs. 3 million on power",

This decline was mainly on account of a sharp fall of Rs. 64 million in the contributions to the capital of the National Textile Corporation (Tulhiriya Project) partly offset by increases in the contributions to several corporations-the major ones being the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation (Rs. 21 million) and the Ceylon Plywoods Corporation (Rs. 18 million) In 1970/71, capital transferes to corporations in the agricultural sector show a substantial increase of Rs. 84 million while transfers to industrial corporations are estimated to decline by Rs. 59 million. The former is due to the allocations granted to the newly set up Mahaweli Development Board and the latter decline reflects the decrease in the grants to the National Textile Corporation (Tulhiriya Project).",

This increase in the gross subsidy bill was partly offset by an increase of Rs. 9 million in the receipts from profits from the sale of sugar and flour and the rice subsidy tax. The profit from the sale of sugar showed an increase of Rs. 15 million while the profit from the sale of flour declined by Rs. 7 million. The increase in the subsidy on local rice was mainly brought about by an increase in the issue by 37,200 long tons or by 18 per cent. The increase in the profit from the sale of sugar was largely on account of increased sales of 30,000 tons (12 per cent.) partly offset by an increase in the average import price from Rs. 559 to Rs. 576, while the decrease in the profit from sale of flour was primarily on account of an increase in the average import price by 9 per cent, to Rs. 681 per long ton.",

    "text": "The increase in the provisional figure of net food subsidy in 1969/70 over the previous year occurred despite a decrease of Rs. 21 million in the gross sub\u00adsidy. This fall in the gross subsidy was primarily due to a decrease of Rs. 17 million in the subsidy on local rice and a decrease of Rs. 12 million in the subsidy on imported rice which together more than offset an increase of Rs. 9 million in distribution expenses and other charges. The subsidy on local rice decreased mainly on account of a fall in the issue of some 21,200 tons (a decrease of 9 per cent.). The decrease in the subsidy on imported rice was the result of a marked fall in the average landed cost of rice from Rs. 920 to Rs. 787 (a fall of 14 per cent.) offset partly by an increase of 58,700 long tons or 22 per cent, in the issue of such rice. However, a decrease of Rs. 30 million in the receipts from profits from the sale of sugar and flour and from the rice subsidy tax more than offset the decrease in the gross food subsidy. Consequently, the net food subsidy increased by Rs. 11 million. The decrease in the receipts from prof its in the sale of sugar and flour and from rice subsidy tax was mainly on account of a considerable fall of Rs. 32 million or 13 per cent, in the profit on the sale of sugar brought about largely as a result of a sharp increase in the average import price from Rs. 576 to Rs. 765 per ton (an increase of 33 per cent.).",

    "text": "In 1970/71 the net food subsidy is estimated to increase sharply by Rs. 119 million or 35 per cent. This increase is primarily the result of the proposal to subject the import of sugar to FEECs which is expected to add Rs. 86 million to the total sugar import bill. In addition, the import price of sugar which rose sharply in 1969/70 was expected to increase still further in 1970/71. Consequently the profit from the sale of sugar was expected to drop by Rs. 103 million, which mainly accounts for the fall of roughly the same magnitude in the expected receipts from sugar, flour profits and from the rice subsidy tax. On the other hand, the gross fcod subsidy is expected to increase by Rs. 15 million. This increase is mainly the result of an increase of Rs. 8 million in the subsidy on",

Even when allowance is made for this factor, the resultant under-expenditure is a substantial figure of Rs. 63.0 million or 23 per cent, as compared with Rs. 9.3 million or 3 per cent in 1967/68 and Rs. 39.1 million or 12 per cent, in 1968/69.

Thefigures of \"Total Provision\" include supplementary estimates, while the figures of \"Actual Expenditure\" include foreign loan expenditure awaiting charge to votes. These figures are also net of sinking fund contributions direct repayments of public debt and special payments to international financial organizations. A minus sign in the \"Under Expenditure'' column indicates an excess of actual expenditure over the total provision. (b) In the financial year 1967/68 and 1968/69, the expenditure of the Public Works Department has been classified under the Ministry of Irrigation, Power and Highways. In 1969/70, this Department was divided into the Department of Highways and the Department of Buildings, the latter falling under the Ministry of Housing and Construction. Hence the figures for the two Ministries for 1969/70 may not be comparable with those for the two previous years.",

The payment of Rs. 49 million in the previous financial year was mainly the result of a payment of Rs. 61 million to Government Departments, partly offset by an increase of Rs. 12 million in the balance in favour of China under the Ceylon/China trade account. The large payment of Rs. 125 million to Government Departments in 1969/70 was on account of the repayment of food bills amounting to Rs. 92 million which were outstanding at the end of the previous financial year while the payment of Rs. 56 million under the Ceylon/China trade account reflected a reduction in the balance that was owing to the People's Republic of China under this trade agreement.",

Nevertheless, there appears to be a gradual decline in the share of unfunded debt (from 41 per cent, as at end of September, 1966 to 38 per cent, as at September, 30 1970). There had also been a decline in the share of securities with less than 5 years to maturity and securities maturing in 20 to 25 years. Meanwhile, there had been a relative increase in the share of securities maturing in 5 to 20 years. This is partly the result of a shift in 1969/70 from the issue of long-term loans to medium-term loans to mobilise resources. Last year's Annual Report1 observed that there was some scope for spreading the debt repayment more evenly by floatation of short and medium term loans as the maturities were unevenly distributed. Despite the issue of short and medium term loans in preference to long term loans in the year under review, there is still scope for the floatation of short and medium term loans.",

The sayings institutions, which had contributed Rs. 36 million in 1968/69, also increased their contributions considerably to Rs. 156 million2 in 1969/70. Meanwhile, the contribution by the nori-barik private sector also increased from Rs. 39 million in 1968/69 to Rs. 73 million in 1969/70. The enhanced subscriptions by the non-bank private sector was mainly from the private trusts, bsnevolent, pension and provident funds (other than the Employees Provident Fund). The semi-government institutions (comprising the Employees Provident Fund .sinking funds, long-term savings institutions, Insurance Corporation of Ceylon and departmental and other official funds) which had been incteasing their contributions through the years (except for a decrease in 1968/69) recorded a sharp increase of Rs. 89 million iri their contributions in the financial year 1969/70. This W J S mainly on account of a rise in the contribution by savings institutions. As in the previous financial years this sector continued to provide the main support for Rupee Loans floated, although its shate decreased from 88 per cent, in 1968/69 to 67 per cent, in 1969/70.

(This limit was successively reduced to Rs. 250 and Rs. 100 subsequently). Amounts in excess of this limit would be surrendered to the bank where an individual had an account or in the case of an individual who did not have such an account to a bank of his choice. From November 3, 1970 to November 25, 1970 (both days inclusive) owners of currency notes of these denominations could deposit their holdings in a commercial bank or the Post Office Savings Bank. (The terminal date was subsequently advanced to November 15, 1970). Banks and all Government and semi-Government institutions were to be made legally obliged to provide information regarding such deposits to the Inland Revenue Department. All depositors who had arrears of tax in respect of any of the six preceding tax years were given the option of paying the arrears at the rate of 33^ per cent, of the entirety of their income for the period or at 50 per cent, of their deposits, which ever was more. This anti-hoatding measure was expected to provide a revenue of Rs. 100 million as additional tax collections.",

A 'Standard' rate taking into consideration the availability of foreign exchange, revenue requirement and the fact that a licence fee is not leviable on imports under normal licencing procedure, was to be fixed at 60 per cent. An imported item was to be assigned to this duty rate band, unless there were special reasons to transfer it to the free, nominal or concessionary rate bands on the one hand, or to a protective or maximum rate band on the other. The rate bands above the standard rate are designed to provide protection to domestic production; to induce the progressive manufacture of components locally and to promote new ventures in fields with potential for future development. The highest rate bands are to include the residual groups of commodities consisting almost wholly of non-essential and luxury items.",

It was observed that the tax was unduly burdensome both to the tax payer and to the Inland Revenue Department and that the collections from this tax were not commensurate with the administrative difficulties and inconveniences involved.",
