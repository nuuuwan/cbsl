(I) EMPLOYMENT AND L A B O U R RELATIONS

1. Introduction

The available statistics on employment and labour relations depict only partially, the current employment situation in the country. On a regular basis, only the following data are available: Numbers placed in employment by Employment Exchanges; Registrants for employment or better employment at the Exchanges. To supplement these figures, the Central Bank carries out an annual survey on employment in the public sector. Further the Central Bank obtains information on employees registered under the Employees' Provident Fund,1

from the records of the E. P. F. department. The latest available figures here are for the year 1968.

According to the annual survey of employment in the public sector con­ducted by the Central Bank, the number of employees in government depart­ments rose by 2.8 per cent and in semi-government institutions by 8.3 per cent.

The number of employees registered under the E. P. F. in 1968 rose by 5.3 per cent in comparison with 1967. The annual average rate of growth for the period 1965-68 was however, 6.8 per cent.

2. Number placed in employment

The annual figures of the number of persons placed in employment by Em­ployment Exchanges from 1960 to 1970 are given in Table II (I) 1.

1. Returns are furnished by "covered" employments to the Superintendent, E. P. F. "Covered" employments consist at present of estates which employ 5 or more persons and establishments other than estates which employ 3 or more persons. However, employees who contribute to approved provident funds are excluded here.

( 213 )

The total number of persons placed in employment by Employment Ex­changes declined from 5,283 in 1969 to 2,825 in 1970. In the unskilled group the decrease in 1970 was more than 55 per cent. In the semi-skilled and techni­cal and clerical groups the decreases were 47 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively.

3 . Employment in the Public Sector

The Central Bank conducts an annual sutvey on employment in govern­ment departments and semi-government institutions (Public Corporations, Universities, Research Institutes, Boards etc.) In 1969, 96 government departments and 55 semi-government institutions responded to the inquiry. In 1970, 107 government departments and 65 semi-government institutions provided the data called for by the Central Bank. The figures for those government departments which did not respond were obtained as far as possible from the Estimates of Government Revenue and Expenditure for 1969/70.

Employees in the public sector are classified according to status i. e.

permanent, temporary and casual, and under the following occupational

categories:

(i) Administrative, Technical and Professional officers of Staff Rank;

(ii) Subordinate Employees;

(iii) Minor Employees;

(iv) Others.

(a) Government Departments

The estimates of employment in government departments for the years 1969 and 1970 are eiven in Table II (I) 2.

In the two years under consideration about 91 per cent of the total number

of employees in government departments was in the subordinate and minor

grades. In 1970, subordinate employees accounted for 37 per cent of the total number employed while minor employees accounted for 54 per cent. The respective percentage shares of these two categories in the previous year were identically the same. Both in 1969 and 1970 administrative, technical and professional grades accounted for 4 per cent of the total number employed in government departments.

Table II (I) 2 shows that the majority of the employees in government departments belongs to the permanent category. In 1970, 79 per cent of all employees in government departments were in employment on a permanent basis. The corresponding figure for 1969 was also 79 per cent. About 6 per cent of the employees in both years have been in the temporary grade. The relative share of the casual grade in total employment had increased marginally in 1970 as against 1969. This is evidently the result of an increase in the number of minor employees engaged on a casual basis for work in different government departments.

In 1970, the total number of employees in government departments increased by 2.8 per cent. The fastest rate of growth was experienced in the administrative, technical and professional grade. Here the number of employees increased in 1970 by as much as 8 per cent. In the case of the subordinate employees the increase in the total number employed had been 3.4 per cent while, for the minor employees category the increase was 2.2 per cent.

* Public Corporations, Universities, Boards etc.

The structute of employment in semi-government institutions in 1970 was almost the same as in 1969. The subordinate and the minor grades accounted for

90 per cent of the total number employed. A notable feature is the predominance

of minor employees in the semi-government institutions. About 72 per cent of the total number in employment at these institutions was in the minor employees

grade. This was due to the fact that many of the semi-government institutions being industrial enterprises, employ a very large number of labourers both skilled as well as unskilled. Both in 1969 and 1970, administrative, tech­nical and professional grades consisted 4 per cent of all employees.

In 1970, about 75 per cent of the employees in semi-government institutions

had been in the permanent category; 19 per cent in the casual grade and 6 per

cent in the temporary grade. This was the pattern of distribution in the

previous year too.

( 216 )

In 1970, the total number of employees in semi-government institutions was higher than in 1969 by 8.3 per cent. The rates of growth in the different occupational categories of employees had been more or less the same. However, the administrative, technical and professional grade grew slightly faster (10.5 per cent) than the others. In absolute terms, the largest increase in the number employed was obsetved in the minor employees' grade.

4. Employees registered under the Employees' Provident Fund

Latest available figures of the number of employees registered under the E.P.F. are in respect of the year 1968. The employees registered under the E.P.F. have been classified according to principal industrial categories. These figures are reported below for the years 1965 to 1968.

(ii) They do not include employment in trades having approved Provident Funds. (iii) The basis of classification according to industry was, in absence of any other infor-mation at present, the nature of establishment, which in many instances did not reveal the actual nature of the industry. This is therefore a rough classification.

At the end of 1968 about 72 per cent of the registered employees were in Agriculture, 10 per cent in Manufacturing, and 10 per cent in Trade and Transport. This had also been the general pattern of distribution of the registered employees under the E.P.F. at the end of 1967.

The number of employees registered under the E.P.F. in 1968 rose by 5,3 per cent in comparison with 1967. The increase in the numbers registered for the two earlier years were 7.9 per cent (1966 over 1965) and 7-1 per cent (1967 over 1966). The annual average growth rate for the whole period 1965-1968 works, out to 6.8 per cent. In 1968, the largest increases have occurred in Other Agriculture (27 per cent) and Construction (32 per cent). Substantial increases were evident in Manufacturing (8.3 per cent), Trade and Transport (7.9 per cent) and Services (7.6 per cent).

( 218 )

At the end of 1968, 19 per cent of the registered employees were in trades

situated in the Colombo District, 17 per cent in Kandy, 11 per cent in Ratna-

pura, 10 per cent in Nuwara Eliya, 10 per cent in Badulla, 7 per cent in Galle and

6 per cent in Kegalle. In comparison with 1967, the pattern of distribution

in 1968 had remained almost the same, As expected, in the Colombo District

the majority of the employees were mainly engaged in Manufacturing (37 per

cent) Trade and Transport (32 per cent) and Services (16 per cent). Most of the employees in the other districts mentioned were plantation workers. It is also evident from the table that the pattern of distribution of employees in Cons­

truction, Trade and Transport and Services in most of the districts was similar.

5. Registrants for Employment

At the end of December 1970, the number of registrants for employment

or better employment, was 410,746 compared to 341,286 at the end of the previous year. In 1970, the registrants for technical and clerical employment increased by about 13,300 as against 10,000 in the previous year. In the skilled

category, the number registered in 1970 was approximately 6,700 and was almost thtee times as high as in 1969. In 1969, and 1970, the number of registrants

for unskilled work was roughly 33,400 and 39,000, respectively.

Table II (I) 6 shows that in 1970, 67 per cent of the total number of

registrants for employment were either semi-skilled or skilled. The proportion

of registrants for technical and clerical work was also high. In 1970, 24 per cent of the total number of registrants were in the Technical and Clerical

category. The corresponding figure for 1969 was 27 per cent.

6. Labour Relations

The Labour Department provides data on the number of strikes, number of workers involved, and the number of man days lost as a result of strikes in the private sector trades. The information obtained from the Labour Depart­ment for the year 1970 is shown in Table II (1) 7.

The total number of strikes in the plantations sector in 1969 was 146. In 1970 there were 217 strikes in the same sector. The number of workers involved in strikes also increased from 56,800 in 1969 to 77,600 in 1970. In "Other Employments" there were only nine more strikes in 1970 in comparison with the previous year.

From the point of view of the numbers involved the major strikes have occurred in the first half of 1970.
