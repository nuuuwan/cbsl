This is an increase of 4-1 per cent in 1970 as against 5.1 percent in the previous year. It is better than the annual average rate of growth of 3.9 per cent in the period 1960-1967, although lower than the average rate of 4-5 per cent for the decade (1960-1969). The higher average for the decade is due to a high growth rate in 1968. Allowing for a population increase of 2.1 per cent in 1970 the rise in Gross National Product per capita is 2.0 per cent. Per capita output has risen from Rs. 760 in 1969 to Rs. 775 in 1970.",

These policies, to some extent affected the volume of activity and a comparison therefore, between the growth rates for 1968 and 1969 with that of 1970, may not be strictly appropriate. The expansion in the two preceding years was sustained to a large extent by the availability of a wide range of inputs, mainly for industry, transport and communications and construc\u00adtion. The abolition of Open General Licences resulted in a wide range of items being less freely available. Although business activity in 1970 was maintained for some time at the levels in 1968 and 1969 due to the availability of stocks built up in the earlier period, these stocks were being gradually exhausted and by the fourth quarter of the year replenishment had become necessary.",

Output of tea has shown a fairly sharp declining trend; at 468 million pounds in 1970 it is only slightly higher than production in 1962. The output of coconut, though higher than in 1969 at 2,447 million nuts, was lower than the output reached in 1966. Rubber production rose from 333 million pounds to 351 million pounds. Since both tea and coconut are vital foreigri exchange earners a sustained effort may be necessary to step up output in both these industries.",

The imposition of the business turn-over tax on the Petroleum Corporation, the removal of the exemption of cigarettes from turnover tax and certain modifications in the turnover on manufacturing industries contributed to the increase of Rs. 136 million in revenue from this source. The sharp increase in FEEC revenue of Rs. 161 million is mainly due to the decision to bring most of the imports of Government Departments under the FEEC scheme which more than offset the loss of FEEC revenue after the suspension of the Open General Licence Scheme in May, 1970. The higher receipts from income tax of Rs. 98 million was partly due to the advance collection of tax dues from corporations and private firms. The decline in import duties by Rs. 154 million was mainly attributable to the abolition of import duties on crude and base oils in the 1969/70 Budget. The loss of revenue from the Electrical Department follows its reconstitution as a public corporation and its consequent exclusion from Government accounts.",

The resources obtained in 1969/70 as commodity loans are also considerably lower than that in the previous year, while receipts in the form of grants reached Rs. 57 million.

Commercial bank credit to Government rose by Rs. 194 million and consisted of increases both in treasury bills and government and government guaranteed securities, but this increase was partly offset by a rise of Rs. 124 million in government cash balances and an increase of Rs. 120 million in other liabilities and accounts of the Central Bank.",

Upto the end of May 1970 holdings of currency of the Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 denominations increased by Rs. 63 million, while the currency issue increased by Rs. 80 million. Between May and July there was a tendency for currency holdings to decline in anticipation of steps which the Government may take against hoarders of notes of high denominations. Since the demonetisation there has been a sharp decrease in the share of currency in the money supply. For instance, in 1970 although money supply increased by Rs. 83 million, currency in circulation fell by Rs. 148 million as a result of the demonetisation. It has to some extent reversed a trend that set in somewhere in the late fifties. But it is yet too early to come to any firm conclusions whether the reversal is permanent because sufficient time has not lapsed for the public to make readjustments. But a salutary aspect of the demonetisation is that a fair segment of the public have had transactions with banks for the first time and this should undoubtedly help to promote the banking habit, especially in the rural sector.",

At the same time import payments were less, due to the curtailment of imports.

Among these were large repayments to the I. M. F. Upto 1969 the drawings from the Fund have exceeded repurchases. In fact, 1970 was singularly exceptional because repurchases exceeded drawings by Rs. 104 million. Due to the inadequacy of foreign aid and loans to meet the entire resource gap, Ceylon had in 1970 to utilize its entire allocation of Special Drawing Rights of Rs. 78 million. The section entitled 'The Balance of Payments Problem' amplifies the earlier trends which have contributed to the gravity of balance of payments situation in the seventies, which is largely evident as a shift in the source of imbalance, to a progressively increasing deficit in respect of capital payments. Of the resource gap ot Rs. 1,124 million only 41.6 percent constituted a deficit in the current account and the balance of Rs. 656 million was in respect of capital repayments. This represents a sharp change from the situation in 1969 when only 31.7 per cent was used to meet capital payments and the balance was to meet the current account deficit. The bunching of capital repay\u00adments in 1970 and in the period immediately ahead is largely due to the fact that the gtace periods of a large number of loans taken in the middle and later sixties have now ended and also because suppliers' credits taken in the late sixties are now falling due for payment.",

Between 1947 and 1970 although export volume increased by 60 per cent value has only increased by 10 per cent. The difference in export earnings has been due to very depressed prices particularly in the sixties. In the intervening period, especially in the mid fifties, the tea export market has been more favourable than it has been in 1968/70. In 1955, Ceylon exported 362 million pounds and receipts were $ 250 million. This was at the peak of the tea boom when tea fetched more attractive prices. In 1965 export earnings rose to $ 254 million with export volume at the record level of 494 million pounds. The latter was not due to an improvement in tea prices but due to a very substantial increase in export volume; prices have generally remained adverse since 1957. From 1960 onwards increases in export volume have to some extent helped to offset losses in earnings from lower export prices, but despite this, foreign exchange earnings have fallen.",

In the period 1947 to 1970 rubber exports have risen by 95 per cent with a 85 per cent increase in total export receipts Here again, the increase in the volume exported rather than prices has contributed to higher export earnings. Prices were heavily depressed in 1956/57 and also in 1962/64 and again in 1967/68 when prices reached the lowest level. The only exception to this general trend was in 1951. when the country exported 229 million pounds of rubber and export receipts were $ 122 million.",

Unlike in tea and rubber, the fall in the export volume of coconut has to some extent been offset by increasing prices. For instance, in 1962, although export volume was 1530 million nuts, earnings were $ 47 million and in 1965 with exports at 1270 million nuts earnings were $ 57 million. In 1969 and 1970 although the volume fell very sharply, higher prices enabled earnings to be maintained at $ 37 million and $ 39 million respectively. In general, export receipts from coconut products despite volume fluctuations, have reflected greater stability and the price factor has often offset shortfalls in the volume of exports.",

External assets which stood at Rs. 1,194 million at the end of 1956 had dwindled to Rs. 457 million by end 1960 largely as a result of import payments much in excess of export earnings. A balance of payments policy, as such, became necessary and the choice was import and exchange controls of increasing rigour which have continued upto the present time, with a brief period of liberalisation under the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme, from May 1968 to August 1970. Despite strin\u00adgent controls, in the period 1961 to 1964, external assets continued to decline, though at a less alarming rate, and recourse was had to drawings from the International Monetary Fund in 1961 and 1962.",

The object of the FEEC scheme was to provide a cash incentive to selected exports and invisible transactions and to impose an additional rupee cost on selected imports and invisible payments. Judging from the substantial inctease in imports of investment goods and raw materials in 1968 and 1969, it would appear that advantage was taken of the free imports possible under the FEEC scheme to utilise capacity in existing industries fully. Under the impetus of the premium exchange rate minor exports have shown some expansion during the last two years. But the increase in export duties has to some extent reduced the benefits to the exporter of the FEEC scheme. Considering the fact that an appreciable expansion in the volume of these exports would normally take several years to achieve, the progress so far made provides evidence of the usefulness of the scheme. Another important direction in which the FEEC scheme has helped to increase foreign exchange earnings is tourism.",

Project aid annually upto 1960 did not exceed Rs. 23 million (except in 1954) while grants constituted the major part of total aid. In 1957, Ceylon ran down its external assets appreciably to finance the deficit but approximately l/5th of the resource gap was financed by project aid, grants and the inflow of foreign capital. This pattern broadly continued until the year 1960.",

The external resource gap rose from Rs. 541 million in 1966 to Rs 649 million in 1968 and to Rs. 1,235 million in 1969. In 1970 the resource gap was Rs. 1,124 million.",

    "text": "From 1961, when active steps were taken to deal with the balance of payments crisis, there was a substantial change in the methods of financing the deficit. External assets could no longer be used as it was the practice in the period 1957-60. Increasing recourse was made to other means. For the first time in 1961 Ceylon made drawings from the I. M. F. to finance approximately l/4th of the foreign deficit during the year. Between 1961 and 1965, the deficits were financed partly by I. M. F. drawings in each of the years 1961, 1962 and 1965, while project aid, grants, private capital and short term credits were the other methods. The financing of the deficit through project aid did not create immediate repayment problems because most of these credits had a grace period. Grants too which exceeded Rs. 37 million in each of these years under review,",

The first relates to the utilization of foreign aid for investments which will tend to increase exports and domestic employment. Commodity aid, or the import savings resulting from aid, should be geared as far as possible to projects which will have an early beneficial effect on the balance of payments. It also points to the need to give much greater emphasis to the production of foodstuffs, particularly subsidiary crops because it is in this area that maximum foreign exchange savings could be achieved in a short time. A properly organised survey of mineral and natural resources might give some indication of other products and raw materials that may be available either for export or as inputs for some domestic industries which are now dependent on imported raw materials.",

The annual expansionary gap in the Budget in recent years has exceeded Rs. 400 million. It is not possible to maintain such an expansionary gap without causing severe strains on the balance of payments, strains which the country's reserves and foreign borrowing capacity could no more bear. It is, therefore, fundamental to a solution of the balance of payments problem that the Government Budget should be brought into reasonable balance and that it should generate a substantial current account surplus in order to finance a part of its capital expenditure. It would greatly assist the balance of payments if the expansionary gap in the 1970/71 Budget is maintained at the estimated level of Rs. 97 million.",

A progressive rise in consumption at the expense of investment could have repercussions on the overall rate of economic growth and the capacity of the economy to sustain a high level of employment. In this context it is imperative that government gives priority to containing consumption within the limts that the economy could sustain with due consideration to a sufficiently high level of investment which will help to maintain a satisfactory rate of growth. This will involve an immediate review of outlays on consumption, subsidies and more realistic prices for public services provided by State enterprises.",
