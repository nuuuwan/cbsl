    "text": "Owing to a substantial improvement in the terms of trade in 1977 which has been recounted earlier, the current account of the balance of payments recorded a surplus for the first time since 1965. In fact, even the 1965 surplus was a single isolated exception in a long series of deficits commencing in 1957. Equally note\u00adworthy was the magnitude of the change in 1977. Following the deficit of Rs. 772 million in 1975, the balance of payments recovered strongly in 1976, reducing the current account deficit to Rs. 50 million. In 1977, this deficit has turned to an un\u00adprecedented surplus of Rs. 1,259 million. Furthermore, net long-term capital inflows rose by Rs. 39 million and led to an improvement in the basic balance to a surplus of Rs. 2,013 million. These developments are illustrated in Table 12 below.",

The services account has been in surplus since 1973, largely on account of a growth in earnings from tourism and bunkering, which more than offset a rise in interest payments and freight.

The import cost of these three food imports rose by 44 per cent in 1977, largely as a result of a 61 per cent increase in quantity, partly offset by a 17 per cent decrease in prices.

    "text": "On account of the favourable outturn of the balance of payments and the changes in valuation necessitated by the depreciation of the Rupee, the gross external assets of Sri Lanka indicated a four-fold increase at the end of 1977. Specifically, the value of the assets rose by Rs. 4,171 million to Rs. 5,574 million. However, in terms of the more stable SDR, the gross assets rose from SDR 137 million at the end of 1976 to SDR 306 million in 1977, a more than two-fold increase. The net foreign assets position showed a corresponding improvement. Generally speaking, the gross external assets at end of 1976 were sufficient to finance 2\\ month's imports of 1977. The assets at the end of 1977 were adequate to finance 4 months' estimated imports for 1978.",

Long-term loans and grants showed an increase of SDR 14 million, while short-term borrowings dropped sharply by SDR 96 million, indicating a greater recourse to longterm borrowing in 1977.

On March 12, the Rupee was revalued by approximately 20 per cent to Rs. 7.28 to the U. S.

By August, the new government decided to rectify this position and the Rupee was allowed to depre\u00adciate gradually, until 15th November. On that day, the basic rate and the premium (FEEC) rate were unified, initially at Rs. 16 = 1 US $ and the Rupee was allowed to float.

While apprecia\u00adting the salutory effect this accrual of unspent resources mobilised by the Government bad on cushioning inflation, one cannot overlook the disappointing performance in capital expenditure which made this possible.",
