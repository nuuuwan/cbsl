    "text": "Favourable export income received in the last several years has led to a gradual decline in the external debt service ratio (the external debt service payments as a percentage of exports of goods and non-factor services) from 23 in 1975 to 20 in 1976 and to 19 per cent in 1977. Meanwhile, the domestic debt service ratio (debt service payments as a ratio of Government revenue) has demonstrated a tendency to increase over the last decade or more. In 1977, it increased by 5 percentage points to 17 per cent. If the Government desires to keep the debt burden at manageable levels, it is essential to raise the quality of public investments.",

    "text": "As in 1976, seasonal factors failed to exert a significant influence on the course of money supply in 1977. Except in the month of July, there was a continuous expansion in money supply throughout the year. This is largely explained by the nature of the major underlying factor responsible for the monetary expansion; namely, the growth in external banking assets, which does not normally display any seasonal pattern. Moreover, commercial bank credit to co-operative institutions was also devoid of the usual seasonal fluctuations. In general, bank advances to co-operatives have tended to rise rather sharply during the first half of the year but taper off during the fourth quarter as the repayment of these advances gathers momen\u00adtum. In 1977, advances to co-operative institutions rose rather sharply during the first 3 quarters of the year and continued to remain high during the rest of the year. Overall, the pattern of monetary expansion in 1977 was characterised by a very sharp increase in the first quarter, moderate increases in the second and third quarters and an acceleration in the fourth quarter.",

Hence, there is a pressing need for training of more bankers in an organized manner, which the proposed Institute of Bank Management is expected to do. The safety of bank branches is vital for the continuing confidence of the public in the banking system, and the government has recently tightened security measures at branches. On the other hand, it may not be prudent to stifle the competitive expansion of the banking network which has been witnessed in recent times. A single monolithic banking network might result in some cost savings, but this will be achieved at the expense of quality and service, which are likely to be poor in a monopolistic situation. On the question of viability of branches, it is not absolutely clear that the financial non-viability of some of the new branches in the initial years is due to excessive competition. New branches do take some time to show positive financial results, even in urban areas. It is also important to bear in mind that the rural branches have been the vehicle of channelling rural credit and that they have in turn mobilized a considerable volume of savings.",

    "text": "In 1977, there was a fundamental change in Sri Lanka's interest rate policy, resulting in a movement to a considerably higher plateau of rates against a back\u00adground of widespread inflationary pressures in the economy. The major thrust of the interest rate reform in 1977 was directed at 'the short end of the market and the upward revisions in Bank rate provided the lead in the drive towards higher rates. The first revision of Bank rate was on January 26, when it was raised by 2 percentage points to 8.5 per cent. It was further raised by l | percentage points to 10 per cent, from August 31, 1977. The latter revision was combined with some restrictions on Central Bank accommodation to commercial banks, so as to make it more effective in influencing the deposit and lending rates of commercial banks. A Utile later, the National Savings Bank was induced to raise the interest rates it pays on its deposits. The National Savings Bank's rate on savings deposits was raised from 7.2 to 8.4 per cent on September 7. Effective same date, the rate on fixed deposits was raised sharply from 7.5 to 12.0 per cent per annum in the case of 6 months deposits; to 15.0 per cent in. the case of 12 month deposits and to 18.0 per cent per annum on 18 month deposits.",

This was followed by an upward movement in the rate on inter-bank call loans - the minimum rate rising from 5 to 7 per cent and the maximum rate from 8 to 9.5 per cent - particularly in view of the increased pressure that was building up in this market following the restriction of Central Bank accommodation at the Bank rate and the progressive withdrawal of the concession of allowing a part of commercial banks' till cash be treated as required reserves.

For the first time, interest rates which hitherto failed to reflect market conditions were permitted to move in step with the general economic conditions in the country. Occurring against the background of widespread inflationary pressures,\" the merits of this change in the short-run could be viewed in the light of its contribution to containing the rate of monetary expansion in the immediately succeeding period. During the four-month period ended Decem\u00adber, 1977 total time and savings deposits of the non-bank private sector with com\u00admercial banks rose by Rs. 583 million, as compared with an increase of Rs. 613 million during the first 8 months of the year. Thus, the average monthly rate of accumulation of time and savings deposits with commercial banks very nearly doubled from Rs. 77 million during the pre-interest reform period to Rs. 146 million in the post-interest reform period. But for this favourable development, the rate of monetary expansion in 1977 and the attendant inflationary pressures would have been considerably higher.",

    "text": "Against the background of a very sharp monetary expansion for the second year in succession, a series of monetary policy measures were introduced in 1977 with a view to restraining the rate of monetary expansion. In the first instance, Bank rate was raised by 2 percentage points to 8.5 per cent in January, 1977 which was further raised by If percentage points to 10 per cent, with effect from August 31, 1977. Secondly, the upward revision of Bank rate on the latter occasion was combined with some restrictions on Central Bank accommodation to commercial banks. Com\u00admercial bank borrowings from the Central Bank at the Bank.rate were restricted to 7 per cent of selected items of assets as at June 30, 1977. Accommodation in excess of this limit was subjected to a penal rate of 15 per cent for 30 days and an additional 1 percentage point for each period of 30 days beyond the initial 30 day period. On November 16, 1977, the level of Central Bank accommodation at Bank rate was further reduced to 4 per cent of the selected items of assets as on September 30, 1977. This limit was, however, revised upwards on December 23, 1977 by Rs. 100 million, for export financing only: this revision was necessitated by the higher credit require\u00adments of the export sector following the exchange rate reform. Thirdly, a gradual reduction of the, proportion of the reserve requirement which the commercial banks were permitted to hold as till cash imposed in October, 1976 was continued. This till cash concession was withdrawn altogether from December 2, 1977 from which date the commercial banks were required to maintain their reserves wholly in the form of rupee deposits with the Central Bank. Fourthly, the banks were also informed of the requirement (imposed previously) not to increase their advances for non\u00adessential purposes and to non-bank companies engaged in lending money and in hire-purchase activities.",

It must, however, be.mentioned that com\u00admercial bank lending to the domestic agricultural sector was not affected by the foregoing measures, as such lending continued to carry refinance facilities from the Central Bank at concessionary rates without change.",

The major underlying factor behind the monetary expansion in 1977 was the growth in net external banking assets and monetary policy per se has little control over the growth in these assets. In fact, a restrictive monetary policy would have helped these assets to grow still further by restraining the flow of imports. The operations of the private sector, where the monetary policy is expected to exert its greatest influence, resulted in a cpntractionary influence of; Rs. 70 million during the year.",

The most important factor for this favourable development was a substantial build-up of time and savings deposits of other private sector constituents following the interest rate reform introduced during August/September 1977. Had it not been for the monetary policy measures put into operation in 1977, the rate of monetary expan\u00adsion during the year would have been considerably higher. The consequences of such a monetary expansion occurring on the heels of a sharp monetary expansion in the previous year would have been to further accentuate the inflationary pressures in the economy.",
