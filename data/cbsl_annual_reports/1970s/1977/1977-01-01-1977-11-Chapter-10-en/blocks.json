In March and May, the ad-valorem tax on tea was raised. The revision in November, however, was to shift the weight of incidence to the tea export duty proper, and to recoup a substantial share of the enhanced export prices resulting from the unified exchange rate. Consequently, the specific export duty on tea was substantially raised from 86 cts. to Rs. 15.50 per kg. and the entire increase of Rs. 113 million in export duty over the previous year was realised in December, 1977.",

Improve\u00adment in the Tobacco tax, inspite of several dislocations in the manufacture of tobacco products in 1977, is attributable to the higher excise (Rs. 77 per lb.) levied on tobacco leaf from the previous year.

The scheme was withdrawn in November, but the loss of revenue from this source is to be compensated by enhanced import and export duties.",

This is largely explained by the nature of the major underlying factor responsible for the monetary expansion; namely, the growth in external banking assets, which does not normally display any seasonal pattern. Moreover, commercial bank credit to co-operative institutions was also devoid of the usual seasonal fluctuations. In general, bank advances to co-operatives have tended to rise rather sharply during the first half of the year but taper off during the fourth quarter as the repayment of these advances gathers momen\u00adtum. In 1977, advances to co-operative institutions rose rather sharply during the first 3 quarters of the year and continued to remain high during the rest of the year. Overall, the pattern of monetary expansion in 1977 was characterised by a very sharp increase in the first quarter, moderate increases in the second and third quarters and an acceleration in the fourth quarter.",
