    "text": "An emerging problem that could assume fairly serious proportions in the future is the exodus of trained and skilled man-power for employment abroad. Unfor\u00adtunately, detailed data on the volume and type of specialization of these categories are not available. While a migration of scientific, engineering and medical personnel has occurred in relatively small numbers over a long period, ever since boom condi\u00adtions have emerged in the Middle Eastern countries following the rise in oil prices in the early seventies, there has been an accelerated outflow of trained and skilled middle level technicians and craftsmen such as electricians, mechanics, welders and so on. As in many other countries, such as India and the United Arab Republic, these personnel could be a source of inward remittances which could provide Sri Lanka with much needed balance of payments support. Also, the migrations could reduce the domestic pressure on employment. But to the extent that such skills are also required in Sri Lanka for its development effort and as far as the training of new persons in such skills would take much time and resources, it is important to ensure that no serious bottlenecks are created in the national development process by absence of necessary skills when required. A detailed quantification and study of this problem as a prelude to a comprehensive manpower planning and training exercise should deserve high priority of the government.",

The quantity\" oftea.exports declined by 14 million kilograms, but the average export price rose sharply from Rs. 10.50 to Rs. 18.86 per kilo in 1977. This price improvement was the combined result of firming of international tea prices in 1977 and the depreciation of the Rupee during the latter part of 1977. Rubber export earnings rose by Rs. 41 million or by. 5 per cent, when a drop in export quantity was again compensated by a rise in prices. In the case of coconut, earnings fell by 12 per cent, (largely) on account of a sharp drop in exports. Earnings from minor agricultural exports rose by Rs. 106 million or by 46 per cent. Customs data reveal an increase in Gem exports of 14 per cent, but according to the State Gem Corporation, exports actually declined in 1977 by^ll^",

Of this, the sub\u00adcategory of food and drink continued to be the major component reflecting the consi\u00adderable dependence of the country on imports for consumption. Rice (Rs. 917 million), -flour (Rs. 925 million), and sugar (Rs. 197 million), taken together, had a share of 34 per cent of total imports. Trade indices indicate a 45 per cent rise in volume of imports of consumer goods on account of near doubling of food and drink imports. Prices showed a rise of 16 peT cent. The share of intermediate goods fell from 49 to 44 per cent, despite an increase of petroleum imports. According to trade indices, the import volume declined by 6 per cent and prices increased by 40 per cent. The share of investment goods dropped from 14 to 12 per cent in 1977.",

    "text": "The budget speech for 1978 paved the way for the operation of a new trade and payments policy for Sri Lanka. The liberalization of imports consequent upon the floating of the Rupee would result in increased imports of industrial and agricultural inputs required for the country's economic growth. With effect from November, 1977 the Government drastically reduced the numbei of items import of which required prior licensing. The Special Import Licence Order No. 1 of 1977 specified less than 150 items that required licensing and permitted the liberal import of machinery, equipment and spares upto the value of Rs. 700,000. The selection of the license-requiring items was determined on the basis of security requirements, the need for protection of certain local enterprises, and the need to continue certain government subsidies. At the sametime, a new tariff structure was announced in the Revenue Protection Order No. 77/2. The new structure introduced 5 basic slabs of import duties, ranging from 5 to 100 per cent. Lowest rates or duty free imports were applied for imports of raw materials that were not produced locally, and higher duties were specified for those that were. Also, the import of goods that were made locally, especially where the quality of the local product was inferior, was allowed at the highest rates of duty. When account is taken of the depreciation of the Rupee and the high freight cost, these measures were considered adequate for the protection of domestic industry. In fact, the influx of imports (at very high prices) was expected to have an incentive effect on local producers to improve their quality; and the relaxation of import controls was expected to induce them to expand production. In other words, there was a fundamental shift away from cumbersome quantitative controls of imports, towards a more simple control by the tariff structure.",
