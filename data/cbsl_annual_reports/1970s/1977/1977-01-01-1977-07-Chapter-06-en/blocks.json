The census reveals that the number of unemployed in 1971 was 0.8 million. The corresponding figure according to the Consumer Finance Survey for 1973 was one million. The age stl'Ucture and the age-specific activity rates in the population indicate that in 1977 about 170,000 youths would have entered the work-force while around 50,000 persons would have left it. These figures net to a demand for Over 120,000 new jobs, and compares with the estimate of 100,000 last year. When the age structure and the age-specific activity rates of the population are considered, the work force unemployed as at the end of .1977 would be over 1 million persons.",
