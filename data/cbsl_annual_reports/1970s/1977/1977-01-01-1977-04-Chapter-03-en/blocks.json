Improved weather in 1977 was the major factor responsible for the better performance of the tea and the paddy sectors; while the lagged effect of the inclement weather in 1976 had its adverse impact on the coconut industry in 1977. The fact that the tea production rose and rubber was able to hold its own, more or less, showed that the effect of highly favourable prices during the year was able to offset the inevitable short-term disruptive effects of the second land reform of late 1975.",

First, the large state land management institutions -the Janavasama and the Usavasama-were transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Plantation Industries. This corrected an incongruous situation where the responsibility for a large acreage of highly productive tea and rubber lands was divided between two Ministries, resulting in a lack of co-ordinated effort. Subsequently, the Usavasama was abolished and the lands managed by it were allocated between the Janavasama and the State Plantations Corporation. Secondly, the personnel of Agricultural Productivity Committees set up under the Agricultural Productivity Law to oversee agricultural activity on a spatial basis were temporarily replaced by government officials, with the ultimate aim of introducing an elective process for selection of such committee members. Further institutional reforms in the agrarian structure are being contemplated. Thirdly, criteria for agricultural lending under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme were drastically relaxed for the 1977/78 Maha season. The consequent loan recovery problem is now being examined. Fourthly, the Government's guaranteed price for paddy was raised from Rs. 33 to Rs. 40 per bushel, from November, 1977. Fifthly, the Govern\u00adment gave high priority to an expansion of paddy/rice storage and paddy milling",

The total replanted rubber acreage by end of 1977 was 336,320, representing only 60 per cent of the total area under cultivation. Efforts to increase local rubber production are much needed if the industry is to meet the increasing domestic and foieign demand for rubber. Hence, the annual replanting targets must be achieved while expanding fertilizer use on young plantations, aided with better extension work. It is expected that the increasing of the replanting subsidy from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000 per acre and the new planting subsidy from Rs. 1,800 to Rs. 2,700 in November, 1977 will assist the industry to improve its productivity in the long run. However, a more concerted effort is required in this regard as the bulk of the rubber land is operated as. relatively small holdings.",

The fall introduction had its impact internally on the cost of living, resulting in high prices of fresh coconut and coconut oil.

    "text": "Milling capacities with both the Board and the private sector were found to be insufficient to cope with the rise in paddy production. The present milling capacity of the Board is about 12,000 paddy tons per month while the private sector mills have a capacity of about 42,850 paddy tons per month. It is reported that serviceable capacity of the privately owned mills is much below this figure, on account of long-term neglect. The inadequate milling capacity of the Board has tended to delay the transfer of paddy in rice form to the Food Commissioner, thereby necessi\u00adtating the Board to carry a large stock of unmilled paddy in their godowns and requir\u00ading the Food Commissioner to import rice to meet ration requirements. This in turn has blocked much needed storage space to allow smooth paddy procure\u00adment under the Guaranteed Price Scheme. The Board has already initiated a pro\u00adgramme to expand and improve its own milling capacity as well as to finance private. millers to improve their capacities. ''-V- -\u2022 \u2014 \u2022",
