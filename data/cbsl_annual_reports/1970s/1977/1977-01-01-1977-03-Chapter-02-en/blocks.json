On the other hand, the output of plantation agriculture grew only marginally by 0.4 per cent, reflecting an increase of 6 per cent in tea and a decline of 0.7 per cent in rubber and 9.2 per cent in coconut. Favourable weather was the main factor responsible for the improvement in domestic agriculture and tea. The previous year's drought had its lagged adverse effects on the coconut industry. j",

Improved weather in 1977 was the major factor responsible for the better performance of the tea and the paddy sectors; while the lagged effect of the inclement weather in 1976 had its adverse impact on the coconut industry in 1977. The fact that the tea production rose and rubber was able to hold its own, more or less, showed that the effect of highly favourable prices during the year was able to offset the inevitable short-term disruptive effects of the second land reform of late 1975.",

First, the large state land management institutions -the Janavasama and the Usavasama-were transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Plantation Industries. This corrected an incongruous situation where the responsibility for a large acreage of highly productive tea and rubber lands was divided between two Ministries, resulting in a lack of co-ordinated effort. Subsequently, the Usavasama was abolished and the lands managed by it were allocated between the Janavasama and the State Plantations Corporation. Secondly, the personnel of Agricultural Productivity Committees set up under the Agricultural Productivity Law to oversee agricultural activity on a spatial basis were temporarily replaced by government officials, with the ultimate aim of introducing an elective process for selection of such committee members. Further institutional reforms in the agrarian structure are being contemplated. Thirdly, criteria for agricultural lending under the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme were drastically relaxed for the 1977/78 Maha season. The consequent loan recovery problem is now being examined. Fourthly, the Government's guaranteed price for paddy was raised from Rs. 33 to Rs. 40 per bushel, from November, 1977. Fifthly, the Govern\u00adment gave high priority to an expansion of paddy/rice storage and paddy milling",
