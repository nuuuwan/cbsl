    "text": "A major constraint to increasing manufacturing output has been the small size of the domestic market. Heavy and continuing protection of local industries, lack of competition from imports and a widespread system of licensing and controls prevented these industries from improving product quality and reaching the levels of efficiency necessary for exporting their products. There were also the well known difficulties of gaining access to international markets. In this respect, the proposals of the 1977 Budget make a radical departure from earlier policies by liberalizing imports, freeing the majority of raw materials from licensing proceduies and per\u00admitting imports of machinery in consignments not exceeding Rs. 700,000 without prior government approval. Also, export-oriented industries are to be fostered in a freer atmosphere of export processing zones which are to be established under the recently constituted authority - The Greater Colombo Economic Commission. A more dynamic growth in industry is anticipated by these proposals. In sum, 1977 witnessed a fundamental change in industrial policy in the form of a shift from import-substitution industry to export-led industrial development.",

Although this index does not measure price movements at the retail level, it is more dependable in ascertaining the changes in prices than the Consumer Price Index. In sharp contrast to the estimated 1.2 per cent increase in Consumer Prices in 1977 as indicated by the Consumer Price Index, the Wholesale Price Index showed a rise in prices of 31 per cent in 1977. The corresponding increase in wholesale prices in 1976 was 8 per cent and in 1975, 3 per cent. On the other hand, the Implicit Price Index -which is the ratio of the Gross National Product at current prices to the Gross National Product at constant (1959) prices - indicated a rise in the price level of 16 per cent in 1977, as against 7 per cent in 1976 and 8 per cent in 1975.

Evidently, the immediate short-run effect on prices of the unification of the Rupee exchange rate and the trade liberalisation in November was an upward pressure on prices. This was expected because the accompanying trade liberalisation would take some time to work itself out, in the form of a substantial increase in imports and a reactivization of domestic production capacity. A moderation of prices could thus be only expected in the forthcoming year, when the economy would react more positively to the reforms of late 1977.",
