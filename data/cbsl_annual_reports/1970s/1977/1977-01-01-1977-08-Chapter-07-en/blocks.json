A welcome easing of pressure in public institutions could be antici-pated with the implementation of new economic policies announced in 1977. The\" liberalization of the economy should lead to new investments and reactivization of under utilized industrial capacities. The accelerated implementation of the Maha-veli Development Project should have a substantial positive impact on employment.

Also, the migrations could\u00b7 reduce the domestic pressure on employment. But to the extent that such skills are also required in Sri Lanka for its development effort and ~.S far as the training of new persons in such skills would take much time and resources, it is important to ensure that no serious bottlenecks are created in the national development process by absence of necessary skills when required. A detailed quantification and study of this problem as a prelude to a comprehensive manpower planning and training exercise should deserve high priority of the government.",
