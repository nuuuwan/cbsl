This was accounted for partly by the decline in output of the Ceylon Steel Corporation and Ceylon Ply\u00adwoods Corporation in 1977. Capacity utilization and value added in these industries dropped below the levels that prevailed in 1976.",

    "text": "A major constraint to increasing manufacturing output has been the small size of the domestic market. Heavy and continuing protection of local industries, lack of competition from imports and a widespread system of licensing and controls prevented these industries from improving product quality and reaching the levels of efficiency necessary for exporting their products. There were also the well known difficulties of gaining access to international markets. In this respect, the proposals of the 1977 Budget make a radical departure from earlier policies by liberalizing imports, freeing the majority of raw materials from licensing procedures and per\u00admitting imports of machinery in consignments not exceeding Rs. 700,000 without prior government approval. Also, export-oriented industries are to be fostered in a freer atmosphere of export processing zones which are to be established under the recently constituted authority - The Greater Colombo Economic Commission. A more dynamic growth in industry is anticipated by these proposals. In sum, 1977 witnessed a fundamental change in industrial policy in the form of a shift from import-substitution industry to export-led industrial development.",

Serious shortcomings of this index, which have been commented upon in past issues of the Annual Report, have rendered it a very unrealistic measure of price changes.",

    "text": "In order to provide a more realistic indicator of price changes, the Central Bank computed a Wholesale Price Index in 1977 with 1974 as the base year. Although this index does not measure price movements at the retail level, it is more dependable in ascertaining the changes in prices than the Consumer Price Index. In sharp contrast to the estimated 1.2 per cent increase in Consumer Prices in 1977 as indicated by the Consumer Price Index, the Wholesale Price Index showed a rise in prices of 31 per cent in 1977. The corresponding increase in wholesale prices in 1976 was 8 per cent and in 1975, 3 per cent. On the other hand, the Implicit Price Index -which is the ratio of the Gross National Product at current prices to the Gross National Product at constant (1959) prices - indicated a rise in the price level of 16 per cent in 1977, as against 7 per cent in 1976 and 8 per cent in 1975.
