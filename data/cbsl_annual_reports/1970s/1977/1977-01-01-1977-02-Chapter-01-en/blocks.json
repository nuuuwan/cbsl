    "text": "The Sri Lanka economy which grew at an average rate of 3.5 per cent during the last five years achieved a higher but modest growth rate of 4.4 per cent in 1977. An improved performance by domestic agriculture, services, trade, transport and communication sectors was largely responsible for this development. The terms of trade improved substantially, for the second year in succession, and induced a trade surplus of about one-tenth of total export earnings. Consequently, the balance of payments recorded a current account surplus for the first time since 1965 and for the second time since 1956. A considerable strengthening of the overall payments position led to a substantial augmentation of external assets. These developments contributed to a sharp expansion of the domestic money supply, for the second suc\u00adcessive year, and certain measures had to be taken to restrain expansion in the private and the government sectors. Nevertheless, the expansion in money supply remained high, and this was mainly responsible for a considerable pressure on the price level. Despite the increase in money wa&es towards the end of the year, real wages appe\u00adared to have declined, except perhaps in the plantation sector. Unemployment appeared t o b e growing, largely on account of the sluggish growth of the economy in recent years which was inadequate to absorb the growing work force. The new Government reacted to this situation by adopting fundamental and far reaching economic reforms, which almost reversed the policies adopted since 1956, or perhaps since Sri Lanka became an independent country in 1948. In that sense, the year 1977 was a watershed in the economic history of Sri Lanka.",

Earnings from minor agricultural exports rose by 46 per cent and industrial exports by about 11 per cent. Although the Customs record an increase in gem exports of 7 per cent, the State Gem Corporation indicates a decline in export value of 11 per cent largely on account of uncertainties in the market. The share of these non-traditional exports in the total exports declined from 26 to 22 per cent in 1977, but this is more a reflection of the remarkable growth in tea export income in the year than a reversal in export diversification.

In the past, Sri Lanka has undoubtedly been successful in containing population growth, ensuring a more equitable distribution of income, and maintaining a quality of life not matched by many other countries with higher per capita incomes. Despite these social achievements, Sri Lanka's capacity to maintain these living standards have been seriously eroded by the slow growth of the economy. The new economic policy stemmed from a basic diagnosis of the malaise, namely, that the continued allocation of a large volume of resources to consumption was inimical to economic growth and generation of employment; that the rigid control system that had been built up over the years had seriously distorted relative prices, and had dampened private sector incentives; that the public sector which was fostered to fill the vacuum had become wasteful and complacent; and that successive governments had failed to take corrective action but had only resorted to short-term palliatives, which had only compounded the problems. It logically followed that greater resources should be channelled for future income and employment generating investment; that the rigid controls, starting with the trade and payments controls meant to maintain a clearly overvalued currency, had to be dismantled; disincentives in the private sector had to be removed; and the public sector had to be made more efficient The basic aim of the initial package of policies was meant to channel more resources to invest\u00adment and to free the economy of some of the vexatious controls, so as to allow the. market forces to play a greater role in the allocation of resources.",

In the short-term, the adverse effects on living standards of the people may have to be cushioned by external assistance especially if a large external resource gap emerges. Also, the policy of liberalizing the economy is likely to take some time to work itself out. For instance, it appears that imports, since liberalization, have tended to be somewhat sluggish, but this has to be expected in the wake of a long period of controls when importers have to re-establish their connections and take a view of the market. Also, the vexatious control system will have to be dismantled systematically and assiduously. If the economic reforms recently initiated by the Government are to be carried to their logical conclusion, it is important to ensure that the implementing machinery does understand the basic thrust of the new economic policies. This would ensure the mutual consistency of various government policy measures that will have to be adopted in the future.",
