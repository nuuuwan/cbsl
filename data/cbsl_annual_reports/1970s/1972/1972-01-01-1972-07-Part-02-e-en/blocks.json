Following the government decision to attach a Co-operative Rural Bank to each of the re-organised Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies, a rapid expansion of the network of rural banks was observed in 1972. During the year under review 131 new rural banks were esta\u00adblished, of which 111 were set up in the first quarter of the year. The expan\u00adsion of the network of rural banks slowed down in the next two quarters due to a shortage in the available supply of iron safes. The number of rural banks stood at 242 at the end of the 3rd quarter. No new rural banks were set up during the fourth quarter because of the commercial bank strike.",

However, this increase in the number of accounts was occasioned by the rapid expansion of the network of rural banks during the year. Therefore, it is more appropriate to show separately the change in the position of the 111 banks which existed at the end of 1971. The number of savings deposit accounts in these 'old' banks1 increased by 16,678 in 1972 over that of the previous year. The number of savings deposit accounts with the 'new' rural banks (established in 1972) stood at 25,773 as at the end of 1972. The volume of savings deposits in rural banks increased by Rs. 5.5 million in 1972 over the level prevailing at the end of 1971. Of this increase Rs. 3.8 million was accounted for by the deposits placed with the 'new rural banks established in 1972. The savings deposits in the *61d* banks recorded only a moderate increase of only Rs. 1.7 million or 9.9 per cent during the year. The average size of savings deposits declined from Rs. 285 at the end of 1971 to Rs. 236 at the end of first quarter of 1972 and continued to decline further during the year until it reached a new low level of Rs. 221 since the third quarter of 1970.",

The number of loan transactions at the end of 1972 stood at 11,515 recording an increase of 790 over the number of transactions at the end of 1971. It is of interest to note that the 131 'new' banks opened in 1972 had only 100 loan transactions at the end of the year. The size of short-term loans at the end of 1972 averaged Rs. 714 which was little higher than the average as at end of 1971. However, the average at the end of the year under review is much lower than the level that prevailed in 1965; one year after the inception of the system of rural banks. The volume of outstanding loans increased from Rs. 7.1 million at the end of 1971 to Rs. 8.2 million at the end of 1972. The volume of outstanding loans of the 131 'new' banks amounted to only Rs 49,791 at the end of the year. At the end of 1972 the total deposits of all rural banks excee\u00added the volume of outstanding short-term loans by Rs. 15.1 million. Deposits in 235 rural banks exceeded the volume of outstanding short-term loans at the end of 1972.",

The volume of total deposits in the Colombo district amounted to Rs. 5.98 million at the end of 1972, representing 25.5 per cent of total deposits of all rural banks, while Kurunegala district held Rs. 2.9 million or 12.4 per cent of the total deposits. In respect of loan operations too, Colombo district had the largest volume of outstanding short-term loans at the end of 1972, which amounted to Rs. 2.1 million or 25.6 per cent of total outstanding loans. Total deposits in all the districts exceeded the volume of short-term loans.",

    "text": "Rural Banks also function as pawn-broking agents of the People's Bank. The popularity of obtaining credit on the pledge of valuable jewellery in rural areas is reflected in the increase in the number of pawn-broking transactions from 21,044 at the end of 1971 to 60,735 at the end of 1972 as shown in Table II (E) 1. It is interesting to note that the 131 'new' banks which had only 100 short-term loan transactions had 21,058 pawn-broking transactions. The extent of financing under pawn-broking rose steeply from Rs. 2,171,734 at the end of 1971 to Rs. 6,958,250 at the end of 1972 or by 220 per cent. The 'old' banks had financed up to Rs. 4,497,553 while the amount financed by 'new' banks amounted to Rs. 2,460,697 at the end of 1972. The high level of borrowing under pawn-broking may perhaps be due to the relatively less cumbersome formalities and restrictions in obtaining such credit.",

The recovery levels of the Yala seasons of 1968 and 1969 at 85.0 and 80.8 per cent respectively too were relatively high compared with the later Yala seasons. Recovery of Yala loans normally runs into the next year. In addition, in 1972 the Bank strike also affected the recovery rate. The higher level of recoveries in the periods shown was influenced to a limited extent by the recoveries made through the hypothecation of the rice ration books of the borrowing households.",

    "text": "The total amount of loans granted for the cultivation of chillies, red onions, potatoes and vegetables at Rs. 5.1 million in 1970/71 has been further reduced to Rs. 4.8 million in 1971/72. An increasing trend noted in the utilization of credit reached its peak in 1969/70 at an amount of Rs. 7.6 million. The continued fall in the utilization of credit thereafter may perhaps be explained by high incomes obtained by the cultivators of these commodities. Loans for potato cultivation, however, have increased continuously. The amount granted for this purpose in 1971/72 at Rs. 2.4 million is an increase of Rs. 1.3 million or 118 per cent over the corresponding amount granted in 1967/68. The percentage of loans repaid had fallen each year. The recovery level of all loans at 82.74 per cent in 1967/68 had fallen to 70.22 per cent in 1970/71. The recovery level of 43.62 percent obtained in 1971/72 is not indicative of the actual position since 53.74 per cent of the loans are still classified as loans not in default. District-wise analysis of loans fot subsidiary crops in 1971/72 is given in Table 65 in Appendix II. The repayment in respect of loans taken for chillies in the Batticaloa district at 71 per cent is the highest level obtained in 1971/72. In all other districts, levels of recoveries were poor. Recovery position of loans for red onions too remained at very low levels;1 the highest recovery rate of 45 per cent was recorded in the Moneragala district. The recovery level, however, in respect of loans for potatoes, was appreciably high in the districts of Badulla and Nuwara Eliya at an average of 92.7 per cent.",
