In certain cases the higher prices of imported goods due mainly to currency re-alignments and higher freight charges tended to increase local prices. The shortages in the supply of domestically produced agricultural goods due to adverse weather conditions added further pressure on prices. In order to offer price incentives for increased production and thus ease the supply shortages that had developed due to the banning or restriction of some of the imports, prices of a number of goods were de-controlled. The main items that were de-controlled were red onions, chillies, matches, toothpaste, shirts, synthetic textiles, transistor and torchlight batteries and 10 varieties of drugs. In a situation where supply was limited, demand pressures had the immediate effect of pushing up prices of most of these de-controlled items.",
