(I) PRICES AND WAGES

1. P R I C E S

The increase in consumer prices in 1972, as reflected by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index1, was 6.3 per cent compared to an increase of 2.7 per cent in 1971. The average increase in this price index for the last five years had been 5.6 per cent.

The upward pressure on prices which began in the last quarter of 1971 continued throughout the year in 1972, The increase in price was due to many factors. In certain cases the higher prices of imported goods due mainly to currency re-alignments and higher freight charges tended to increase local prices. The shortages in the supply of domestically produced agricultural goods due to adverse weather conditions added further pressure on prices. In order to offer price incentives for increased production and thus ease the supply shortages that had developed due to the banning or restriction of some of the imports, prices of a number of goods were de-controlled. The main items that were de-controlled were red onions, chillies, matches, toothpaste, shirts, synthetic textiles, transistor and torchlight batteries and 10 varieties of drugs. In a situation where supply was limited, demand pressures had the immediate effect of pushing up prices of most of these de-controlled items.

In order to moderate the impact on prices, whilst maintaining the equitable distribution of essential commodities, price control and rationing of a number of items were continued in 1972. However, prices of a few controlled items were revised upwards to take account of the higher import costs or rise in production costs or both.

(a) The Colombo Consumers' Price Index

The all items index increased by 6.3 per cent in 1972 in comparison with an increase of 2.7 per cent in 1971. The sub indices in respect of food increased by 6.0 per cent, clothing by 12.8 per cent, fuel and light by 3.6 per cent and miscel­laneous items by 6.2 per cent. The corresponding increases in 1971 were 1.8 per cent, 5.6 per cmt, 3.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent. As in previous years the sub index for rent remained unchanged.

The sub index for food which has 61.9 per cent of the weightage in the overall index increased steadily after the first quarter of the year. The sub index which stood at 145.5 per cent in January dropped in February and March mainly

1. The main short-comings in the use of this index to measure the changes in retail prices have been discussed in the previous Annual Reports.

The main drawbacks are:

(i) the inadequacy of the index to measure the changes in the general level of prices as it is designed to measure changes in the cost of living of an average working class family in Colombo town;

(ii) the out of date weights which have not been revised since 1952 despite substantial chinges in the pattern of consumption of the working class itself; and

(iii) the inidequite attention paid to the relative importance of prices prevailing in open and controlled markets due to fluctuations in the supply of commodities caused by shortages.

( 177 )

on account of the fall in the prices of vegetables, coconuts, and coconut oil. Thereafter the sub index took an upward trend. The'main factors that contri­buted to the rise in food items were the increase in the cost of imports due to the readjustments of currency rates, the removal of price controls and the banning the imports of such items as dried chillies.and ted onions and the consequent inabi­lity of the;local producers to meet the shortages. •;• The increase in' the price of Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates and the broadening of the scope of business turnover tax also had some effect on prices during the last quarter. The items which recorded marked price increases during tne year were limes, biscuits, fresh butter, pulses, dried ginger, jam, beef and dried fish.-

Price decreases were recorded-in tea, vegetables, fresh fish, eggs, potatoes and spices. The price decreases, however, had little effect, over the sub index that continued to increase during all the four quarters of the year. ,

The increase of 12.8 per cent in the sub index of clothing was the largest increase recorded among the sub indices. The rise in the index is attributed mainly to higher wages paid to the local manufacturing workers and the increase in the landed costs of raw materials. The sub index stood at 152.0 in January and reached the highest figure of 171.4 in October and thereafter remained stationary. Almost all items of clothing showed substantial increases in price. The highest increases were recorded in sarongs, sarees and vetties.

The sub index for fuel and light rose by 3.6 per cent during the year. The increase is almost identical with that of the previous year. The increase is due to the upward revision in the price of kerosene oil in March, electricity charges in April and the price of matches in November 1972.

The increase in the sub index for miscellaneous items was 6.2 per cent as compared with 4.1 per cent in 1971. Transport expenditure increased on account of the revision of prices of tyres and tubes in.July. The prices of tobacco and educational materials recorded increases in November and December respectively. The only item that had a fall in price in the year was betel and arecanuts.

(b) Prices not covered by the Consumers' Price Index

Price data for a limited number of items not covered by the Consumers' Price Index are obtained by direct inquiry from the retailers in the city of Colombo and from the published trade price lists. These items for purposes of detailed analysis are broadly classified into consumer, intermediate and investment goods.

Table II (I) 2 shows the percentage changes in the prices of selected items

from the end of year 1971 to the end of year 1972. These figures may be tteated

as rough indicators of the extent of price movement of similar class of goods.

Consumer Goods

The prices of all items of consumer goods considered above have increased. This is mainly attributed to the increase in prices of raw materials, wages and increase in world market prices of imports. Higher rates of freight, Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates and Business Turnover Tax also contributed to the price increases. The scarcity of some items in the open market too tended to increase the prices of such items.

The scarcity created in motor spare parts and removal of controls on prices of such items as shirts, torch batteries, toothpaste were the other factors that led to price increases in these consumer items.

The increase in price of pat boiled rice fluctuated between 11 per cent and

17 per cent over that of last year.

Intermediate goods

The prices of locally manufactured intermediate goods have increased mainly due to higher production costs. The price of petrol was revised twice during the course o' the year. In February, the prices of super petrol was raised to

Rs. 5/- per gallon and ordinary petrol was raised to Rs. 4/80 per gallon These prices were again revised in December to Rs. 5/75 per gallon and Rs. 5/30 per gallon respectively. High cost of crude oil and freight rate increases have been the main causes for these revisions in the price of petrol.

Investment Goods

The prices of many of the finished products of the State Steel Corporation have been incteased during the year. However, the price increases were not substantial. The controlled price of mammoties was revised upwards. Apart from increase in production costs, scarcity of cement, asbestos sheets and other investment goods caused price fluctuations in this category of articles.

Price Control

Some of the items that were brought under price control during the year were lamp mantles, formic acid and seven varieties of drugs.

The controlled prices of the following articles were revised: asbestos sheets,

sustagen, imported textiles, refined white 6ugar, lakspray, condensed milk, e xer

cise books, and some varieties of pulses.

( 181 )

The control of prices on the following items was removed during the course

of the year: red onions, dried chillies, barbed wire, synthetic textiles, paper;

cardboard, bicycle tyres and tubes, torch and transistor batteries, toothpaste, matches and ten varieties of drugs.

(c) Wholesale prices of locally manufactured commodities

Table 11 (1) 3 gives a few representative items of locally manufactured

commodities under each btoad category. The prices do not refer to prices

charged by bulk distributors at various points of distributive trade, but refer to

those quoted by the manufacturers themselves or their sole agents.

The wholesale prices of a large number of goods in the categories of Textile

and Apparel, Industrial, Commercial and Agricultural Machinery and Equipment

have shown considerable increases. The stability in the wholesale prices of

most of the items in the Textile and Apparel category that prevailed last year did

not continue during the year due to the removal of controls on synthetic

textile.

The high prices that prevailed earlier in construction materials attained a

certain degree of stabilization during the year. The wholesale prices of fertilisers

increased slightly during the course of the year.

The wage rate indices are prepared by the Central Bank for technical and clerical employees, minor employees and school teachers in the Government Sector. They are based on the minimum salaries and wages and allowances payable to workers in the representative-scales. Overtime and incremental payments, however, are not included in this calculation. Wage rate indices for workers in Agriculture and Industry and Commerce coveted by Wages Boards in the private sector ate published by the Labour Department. These indices are based on minimum wage rates fixed by Wages Boards and from December 1967 include devaluation allowances. The base period for these indices is 1952.

These indices referred to above do not represent actual earnings which would include overtime and in the case of the private sector, incentives or special payments such as bonuses. Indices of real wage rates are calculated by the Central Bank by deflating the wage rates indices by the Cost of Living Index (The Colombo Consumers' Price Index). ,

(a) Combined index for clerical and technical employees, and minor employees.

Note The index numbers are calculated on fixed weights, based on the numbers employed as at September 30, 1959. The wage rate used in the calculations of index numbers are the initial salaries and wages and allowances in each representative scale.

Table II (I) 4 shows the annual and quarterly indices of wage rates and real wage rates of Government employees for 1971 and 1972.

( 185 )

The wage rates of technical and clerical employees minor employees and school teachers remained unchanged during 1971, and up to November 1972. In December 1972, however, there was a rise in wage rates of Government employees as a result of the payment of a special allowance to monthly paid employees drawing less than Rs. 250/ - a month in accordance with the Budget proposals.

The indices of wage rates for the last quarter of 1972 for all Government employees covered by this index showed an increase over any of the previous three quarters. On the other hand, the annual average indices of wage rates of all categories of workersjwere slightly more in 1972 than the average for 1971.

In the case of Government school teachers and clerical employees the indices rose by 0.1 per cent while for minor employees it rose by 0,3 per cent.

The quarterly indices of real wage rates for technical and clerical employees, minor employees and school teachers were less in 1972 than the respective quarterly indices for 1971.

The annual average indices of real wages of all categories of workers were less in 1972 than in 1971. In the case of government school teachers and clerical employees the indices declined by 5.9 per cent while for minor employees the decline was by 5.7 per cent.
