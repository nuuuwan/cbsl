    "text": "Crop failure was the most important single cause for default. Nearly 26 per cent of the defaulters have not repaid 32.8 per cent of the overdue loans. Crop failure would lead to low incomes, especially among the small cultivators. Nearly 17.2 per cent of the defaulters gave low incomes as the main reason for their inability to repay in time and they accounted for 16.2 per cent of the over\u00addue loans. It cannot be denied that crop failure was the main reason for low incomes. Though almost all the defaulters could have given low incomes as the main reason for default, some of them considered other factors more important. The two most important causes - low income and crop failure - that are related to each other, accounted for 49 per cent of the loans overdue. Another set of reasons that can be grouped together comprises those relating to indifference of co-operative officials and malpractices in the co-operatives. Of the defaulters 8.8 per cent reported that if the co-operative officials had not shown indifference, but had been active, they would have repaid their loans in time. Some defaul\u00adters (7.8 per cent) did not see any useful purpose served in returning the borrowed money in time because, they felt that the co-operatives either did not return them to the People's Bank or misused the money thus returned. The proportion of overdue loans on this account was 11.3 per cent of the total.",

    "text": "On the average the cost of major repairs per boat per year was estimated at Rs. 3,006/= If this amount is taken as depreciation,. the net return on capital amounts to 13.5 per cent The annual amount of the loan required to be paid back on a boat taken on hire- purchase from the Department of Fisheries alone was 24 per cent of the value of investment. This leads to the question whether the boat owner suffers a loss in the operation of the boat. The boat owner, in fact, has to pay back only 50 per cent of the capital and interest which in total amounts to 60 per cent of the capital. Hence, if the boat owner gets a 13.5 per cent as return, he should be able to settle the loan in 4J years. When one takes into account the fact that the profit during the early years ot operation is higher than that during later years, one is led to the conclusion that the loan could be settled in a shorter period. The following table, worked out from survey data, shows that the loan could be settled in about 34 years. .",

There is evidence to suggest that there is room to increase profit (a) by increasing catch and (b) by reducing maintenance costs by more careful handling of boats. The annual expenditure on minor and major repairs alone form 16 per cent of the capital outlay. It is very probable that due to difficulties of obtaining spare parts, their high costs, non-availability of convenient repair facilities and heavy expenses on repairs, the boat owners do not attend promptly to the mechanical problems in the boats.",

An impedi\u00adment to an immediate increase in catch per trip was the lack of adequate fishing gear. Further, 13 fishing trips per month per boat, as estimated, indicates a considerable idling of fishing boats. It appeared that with better organisation and management the number of trips could be considerably increased. This, obviously, is one direction in which the use of existing assets can be increased.",
