( C ) P U B L I C ENTERPRISES

The data published in the following paragraphs and in the Tables are those provided by the respective enterprises. The data furnished in the Report are not final and are liable to revision when audited figures become available.

In view of the delays in finalising accounts for 1972 in most public corpora­tions, provisional data have been used in the Tables. Consequently, the useful ness of statements on the overall performance of the corporation sector is limited.

The total number of corporations as at end of 1972 was 74, of which 61

were established in this year.

Total investment in public enterprises rose by 33 per cent to reach Rs. 4.5912 million in 197 23, as against Rs. 3,461 million in the accounting year 1970/71. Table II ( C ) I shows the distribution of investment between broad categories of activities in the public sector in 1972. Nearly 42 per cent of the total capital investment was made by industrial enterprises. Increase in investment was highest in industrial sector in absolute terms.

Capital per employee in all corporations increased from 27,101 in 1970/71 to 29,990 in 1972. Capital per employee in 1972 in industrial corporations was Rs. 36,510 while in the services sector it was Rs. 21,050. Employment in all corporations increased from 154,908 in 1970/71 to 177.2584 in 1972.

( 51 )

In 1972, thirty-four corporations including banks and other financial institutions of the public sector have shown profits.1 Of these, twenty corporations made larger profits than in the previous year; eight have made less profits, while one made a profit as against a loss in the previous year. Eleven enterprises have incurred losses in 1972. Of these, three have incurred bigger losses than in the previous year. Three have reduced losses and two have incurred losses as against a profit in the previous year. In 1972, contributions to the Consolidated Fund by profit making enterprises for 12 months period amounted to Rs. 69.717 million as against art anticipated contribution of Rs. 107 • 17 million for the 15 month period ended 1972.

2. I N D U S T R I A L C O R P O R A T I O N S

The number of industrial corporations (including Fisheries) was 25 in 1972, but one of them (State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation) had not commenced production. The total capital investment in industrial corporations was Rs. 1,885 million which represented a 34 per cent increase over the accounting year 1970/71. However; capital employed in actual production was Rs. 953.1 million or 51 per cent of the invested capital.

Value of output (at current prices)2 of industrial corporations increased from Rs v 578.4 million in 19713 to Rs. 871.1 million in 1972 or by 50 per cent.

There was a concentration of output in the capital intensive industries. Three Corporations-Petroleum, Cement and Steel-had 50 per cent of the capital employed and they accounted for 49 per cent of the total output.

Table II ( C ) 2 gives a summary of the performance for the year 1972.

Several industrial enterprises recorded an increase in production in 1972. Increases in production were recorded in the case of Oils and Fats, Flour, Petroleum' and Salt. The production of salt increased on account of favourable weather conditions and increased capacity. A fall in production was recorded in the case of Tyre and Cement.

Flour Milling, Ceramics and Mineral Sands Corporations worked above 80 per cent of capacity while Leather Products and Steel Corporations worked below 50 per cent of capacity. Market limitations of some of the corporations such as Steel and Tyre resulted in the absorption of only a small proportion of installed capacity by the domestic consumers. Thus in the case of certain products utilization of capacity was low due to deliberate curtailment of production in view of the limited demand. Apart from this, absenteeism, lack of continuity in the supply of certain raw materials and breakdown of machinery are some of the important reasons for the low degree of capacity utilization.

1. Profit 'and loss figures for 1972 are not available in respect of 12 corporations. 2- No attempt ismade here to convert these data into constant prices because of the non­availability of a suitable deflator. '. 3. It was possible to obtain comparative data on output, employment and foreign exchange earnings from the corporations themselves for 1971 and 1972 on a calendar year basis.

The value of sales of manufacturing corporations increased from Rs. 1,043 million in 1971 to Rs. 1,282 million in 1972 representing an increase of 23 per cent. This excludes the value of sales arising from purely trading activities. The increase in turnover of the corporations was in part due to price revisions that were made in the course of 1972. Increases in the value of sales were recorded in the case of Petroleum, Textiles and Milk Board while the sales value of Leather Products and Fisheries declined.

During the year under review, industrial corporations made a profit (before tax) of Rs. 88.3 million. Apart from the major activity of manufacturing, some of the public sector manufacturing enterprises were also engaged in trade. They were: Eastern Paper Mills Corporation, Ceylon Steel Corporation, Paranthan Chemicals Corporation, Ceylon Plywoods Corporation and the Oils and Fats Corporation. Data pertaining to the trading activities of these institutions are shown in Table II (C) 4.

Industrial Corporations have contributed Rs. 35.8 million to the Consoli­dated Fund in 1972.

The total foreign exchange earnings of industrial corporations resulting from export activities have recorded an increase from Rs. 95.3 million in 1971 to Rs. 98.3 million in 1972. Of this, the Petroleum Corporation accounted for Rs. 69.3 million. The Oils and Fats Corporation recorded an increase in its export earnings from Rs. 2.7 million in 1971 to Rs. 4.5 million in 1972. The Ceylon Leather Products Corporation recommenced its export business with the sale of leather and hide abroad.

The average rate of return before tax, on capital employed in production was 9.2 per cent in 1972 while the return on investment was 4.8 per cent. The highest return on capital employed was shown by the Textiles Corporation which recorded 34.5 per cent while the Leather and Paranthan Chemicals Cor­porations recorded a return of less than 3 per cent.

The industrial corporations provided 6,616 additional jobs in 1972 to bring the numbers employed to 35,981 persons. The total wage bill increased from Rs. 102 million in 1971 to Rs. 139 million in 1972.

3. I N D U S T R I E S I N T H E P U B L I C S E C T O R

A. Food, Beverages and Tobacco

(a) 'National Milk Board:

In 1972, the output at the powdered milk factory increased from 13.1 million lbs. in 1971 to 17.9 million lbs. which was 36 per cent higher than that of the previous year. Value of production too, has shown a corresponding increase. Sales turnover has recorded a substantial increase to reach Rs. 54.1 million in 1972. The profit of the powdered milk project was Rs. 5.6 million in

1971 and the results in 1972 have not yet been finalised.

Data relating to condensory were not made available.

(b) Oils and Fats Corporation:

The capacity of the provender plant has increased in 1972. Its output of 66 thousand tons of provender represented 92 per cent utilization of plant capacity. The output of oil has recorded a 131 per cent increase from 480 tons in 1971 to

1113 tons in 1972, but it was only 30 per cent of capacity. Production of fatty acids has declined while the production of glycerine remained static.

The turnover recorded a 66 per cent rise over the previous year. The foreign exchange earned by exporting fatty acids and glycerine increased by 90 per cent to reach Rs. 4.5 million. The budget for 1973 anticipates a substantial increased in output and a bigger sales turnover.

Meanwhile, the profit in 1972 was Rs. 1.2 million compared to Rs. 2.8 million in the previous year. This decline was largely on account of an increase in

the wage bill which rose from Rs. 2.3 million in 1971 to Rs. 3.3 million in 1972.

This Corporation was entitled to a Government grant since it was required to maintain the selling price of provender at a level below that of the open market price in order to encourage the local poultry industry. This was taken into account in working out the profitability.

(c) Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation:

Total capital investment of the Corporation amounted to Rs. 146.5 million in 1972. Data relating to the financial year 1972 were not made available and hence it is not possible to review the Corporation's performance for the period.

(d) State Flour Milling Corporation:

The State Flour Milling Corporation has recorded its highest level of output since the commencement ot commercial production in 1969. The value of output of flour increased by 10 thousand tons to 71 thousand tons which is slightly above the installed capacity. With this level of production the Corporation

( 63 )

is meeting only one-fifth of the annual demand of flour in Sri Lanka. In the circumstances, the Corporation is planning to increase its capacity to manufacture 110,000 tons with Soviet Technical Assistance.

Inspite of an increase in production and turnover and an upward revision of prices of bran and pollard, the Corporation incurred a loss of Rs. 2.2 million as against a profit of Rs 1.8 million in the previous year. This was largely on account of an increase in the prices of imported raw materials and due to the local selling price. The Corporation earned Rs. 5.7 million in foreign exchange by exporting bran and pollard.

(e) National Salt Corporation:

With the establishment of a new saltern at Kurunchative in the Northern Province the Corporation's capacity for production of salt increased substantially. This year was an exceptionally good year in production and the Corporation was able to produce and purchase a record 156,250 tons of salt due to favourable weather conditions, creation of additional capacity and improvements made to existing salterns. Since this exceeds the domestic demand of 90,000 tons per annum, the Corportion is exploring possibilities of exporting the balance.

The value of output doubled from Rs. 3.8 million in 1971 to Rs. 7.03 million in 1972. Sales, however, were almost static but profits were slightly lower largely on account of increased costs. Limited sales constitute a major constraint for this Corporation to improve profitability on increased production. Profit before tax amounted to Rs. 1.5 million in 1972. The return on capital employed was 6.63 per cent compared to 22.89 per cent in the previous year. Wage bill of the Corporation was Rs. 3.2 million in 1972.

In 1973, the Corporation has budgeted for a lower output largely because of the unsold stocks of the previous year. Sales, however, are expected to increase and the Corporation anticipates a moderate increase in profits.

B. Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather Industries

(a) National Textiles Corporation:

The Spinning and Weaving sections of the Thulhiriya mill were commissio­ned in 1971. This mill could eventually have an annual capacity to produce 17 million lbs. of yarn and 14 million yards of cloth.

The value of production at Veyangoda mill declined marginally from Rs. 37.3 million in 1971 to 36.6 million in 1972. Sales also have recorded a corres­ponding decrease.

Data relating to the financial year 1972 were not available in respect of Thulhiriya Mill and hence it is not possible to review the Corporation's overall performance for the period.

(b) Ceylon Leather Products Corporation:

The output of chrome leather and leather goods has recorded an increase, whereas that of shoes and bark leather declined during the year under review. A new factory was established for the production of leather goods at the Ekala

( 64 )

Industrial Estate in mid-1972. The output of leather goods such, as brief cases, gloves, sports goods, picks for the textile industry and straps, rose by 46 per cent. The domestic market absorbed the entire output of leather goods.

The Corporation's shoe factory worked at 67 per cent of its capacity mainly on account of production being geared to the internal market demand. The accumulation of stocks of shoes has been due to increasing competition from private firms in the industry.

Some structural changes in the leather industry were noticeable in 1972 with the intervention of the Corporation in the supply of certain raw materials to private producers. For instance, the Corporation took over the production and distribution of chrome tanned leather manufactured by the Indo-Ceylon Leather Co. Ltd. Furthermore, the Corporation supplies the chemicals required by local tanners.

It may be noted that the Corporation has exported chrome leather and bark leather amounting to Rs. 0.5 million. This Corporation recorded a profit of 272 thousand rupees as against a loss in the previous year. Employment decreased from 908 in 1971 to 899 in 1972.

C. Wood and Wood Products

(a) Ceylon Plywoods Corporation;

With the commissioning of Wood Work Complex at Avissawella, the Corporation has an overall capacity to manufacture 105 million sq. ft. of 3 ply plywood. The chip board plant was commissioned towards the end of 1971 and the plywood factory commenced production in mid-1972.

The production of tea chests increased from 1.043 million in 1970/71 to 1.181 million in 1972. The budgeted output of tea chests in 1973 at 2.6 million is 112 per cent higher than the output in 1972 and reflects a continuance of an increasing production trend in recent years. Under-utilization of capacity at the Gintota factory was due to irregularities of timber supplies.

Now the Corporation is responsible for the import and distribution of tea chests and fittings. Consequently, the turnover increased substantially in 1972. On a higher turnover the Corporation made a profit of Rs. 1.56 million representing a 14.4 per cent return on capital employed. Total capital invested by this Cor­poration amounted to Rs. 124.5 million. In 1973, the Corporation expects to more than double its value of output.

(b) State Timber Corporation :

During the year under review this Corporation has invested Rs. 9.7 million on new capital assets such as transport equipment and construction work. In 1972, the production and sales were higher than that of the previous year. Despite the increase in turnover the Coporation incurred an estimated loss of Rs. 3.4 million in 1972 compared to the profit of Rs. 1.1 million in 1971. This is attributed to the increase in the wage bill from Rs. 4.2 million in 1971 to Rs. 6.2

C 65 )

million in 1972. Meanwhile, the loss is estimated to fall to Rs. 2.4 million in 1973. The Corporation has exported 1,856 cu. ft. of logs through Consolidated Exports to the value of Rs. 0.28 million in 1972.

D. Paper and Paper Products, Printing and Publishing

(a) Eastern Paper Mills Corporation:

The Paper Board Mill at Valaichchenai commenced commercial production in May 1972 with an annual capacity to manufacture 12,000 tons of paper boards. Together with the old mill at Valaichchenai this Corporation now has an annual capacity to manufacture 22,500 tons of paper.

The output of paper and paper products increased by 52 per cent; the increase in turnover was 72 per cent over the previous year. The relatively higher growth of turnover was attributed to the upward revision of prices of all grades of local paper with effect from November 1971. In view of the increased cost of' production, the Corporation incurred a loss from its manufacturing activities for the last three quarters of 1971. Financial results from manufacturing activities in 1972 were not available.

The average capacity utilization has decreased from 87 per cent in 1971 to 62 per cent in 1972. This low utilization of capacity was due to interruptions in production in view of the need to integrate the new paper board mill with the old pulp and paper plant at Valaichchenai. The low quantity of production is also due to the high quality of paper produced with low gram weight.

This Corporation also trades in imported paper. Its paper imports have been declining since 1966/67.

The Corporation has commenced construction of its pulp and paper factory at Embilipitiya for the manufacture of printing and writing paper with an annual capacity of 15,000 tons. The proposal to establish another mill at Rajangane is under consideration.

Employment of this Corporation has recorded an increase by 339 to reach 2,220 in 1972.

(b) State Printing Corporation:

The total investment of this Corporation was Rs. 10.1 million in 1972. Data relating to the financial year 1972 were not available.

E. Chemicals, Petroleum, Rubber and Plastic Products

(a) Paranthan Chemicals Corporation:

There has been an increase in the output of all the leading items produced by the Corporation in 1972. Capacity utilization in the production of liquid chlorine and hydrochloric acid was 44 and 32 per cent respectively. The low utilization of capacity was due to the limited market for these products. The value of sales increased substantially by 27 per cent to reach Rs. 5.2 million in 1972. This is largely on account of increased prices of caustic soda solid from

( 66 )

Rs. 1,800 to Rs. 1,920 pet ton and calcium chloride from Rs. 700 to Rs. 1,500 per ton. On a higher turnover in 1972, the Corporation made a profit of Rs. 0.3 million from its manufacturing activities representing 2.8 per cent return on capital employed. However, the total profits of the Corporation decreased during the year under review.

(b) Ceylon Tyre Corporation:

The Ceylon Tyre Corporation has the capacity to manufacture 250,000 tyres and 250,000 tubes. The Corporation deliberately limited its manufacture of truck tyres owing to sales difficulties. Production of tyres decreased from 158,400 in 1971 to 149,293 in 1972. Capacity utilization continued to below due to the fact that the Corporation has moulds to manufacture only a limited range of tyre sizes.

The value of production increased marginally. Meanwhile, the value of sales increased by Rs. 8.3 million to reach Rs. 51.9 million in 1972. EHiring the yeat under review the Corporation made a profit before tax of Rs. 9.3 million compared to a profit of Rs. 8.5 million in the previous year. This year's return on capital employed was 13.84 per cent while it represented 9.3 per cent on invested capital of Rs. 100.2 million. The use of local raw materials decreased from 27 per cent in 1970/71 to 21 per cent in 1971/72. Employment increased from 1,657 in 1971 to 1,893 in 1972.

(c) Ceylon Petroleum Corporation:

Oil Refinery

With a view to meeting the local demand for petroleum products the Corporation has plans to increase the crude oil refining capacity from 1.8 million tons to 2.2 million tons.

The production at the oil refinery increased from 1.4 million metric tons in 1971 to 1.6 million metric tons in 1972. The value of output of all its products rose by Rs. 101 million to reach Rs. 235 million in 1972 mainly because of an increase in the price of crude oil. Imports of crude oil for refining increased by 17 per cent whereas the value of imports rose by 35 per cent on account of rise in import prices. According to provisional data the refinery has made a profit of Rs. 33.1 million in 1972 as against Rs. 17.3 million in the ptevious year.

Lubrication Oil Blending Plant

At this plant base oils and additives are blended into various grades of lubricants. There has been a slight decline in both quantity and value of output. However, the level of output was adequate to meet market requirements. Inspite of a decline in the sales quantity, domestic sales turnover increased owing to the upward revision of transfer prices by 10 cents per gallon. This was on account of price increases of its purchases, i.e. base oils and additives.

( 67 )

(dJ Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation:

This Corporation took over the functions of the Ayurvedic Drugs Manu­facturing Unit of the Small Industries Corporation in 1969. In addition to the manufacture of drugs this Corporation engages in the import and distribution of raw and prepared Ayurvedic, Siddha, Unani and other drugs.

The value of output doubled in 1972 over that of the previous year. Mean­while, the Corporation has budgeted for a substantially higher output in 1973. The increased turnover in 1972 over 1971 was largely on account of an upward revision of prices which was made in June 1972. The profit from its manufacturing activities is estimated to be Rs. 0.35 million in 1972 as against Rs. 0.26 million in the previous year. Employment increased from 201 in 1971 to 329 in 1972.

(e) State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation:

This Corporation which was established in 1966 is expected to implement a project for the manufacture of Urea with an annual capacity of approximately 280,000 tons. The main raw material for production would be naptha, a b y product of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery. The project is expected to cost around Rs. 350 million.

F. Non-Metallic Mineral Products (except Petroleum Products)

(a) Ceylon Ceramics Corporation:

There was an all-round increase in the output of all kinds of products of this Corporation in 1972. The crockery and sanitary ware section recorded a production which was above capacity. Production at the Kaolin Refinery was 15 percent below capacity because of market limitations. The value of production rose by 34 per cent to Rs. 12.9 million in the year under review over 1970/71. On a higher turnover in 1972 the Corporation made a substantially enhanced profit of Rs. 5.5 million. The return on capital employed in production was 27.5 per cent.

The Corporation has taken steps for the establishment of a ceramics factory in Rattota with an annual capacity of 1,040 tons for the manufacture of porcelain table-ware. This plant is scheduled to commence production at the end of 1973.

Employment in 1972 was 1,256 as against 1,060 in 1971

(b) Ceylon Cement Corporation:

The total output of the three cement factories declined marginally from 379,000 tons in 1971 to 377,000 tons in 1972. With the commissioning of Stage II of the Puttalam Cement Works, the overall annual production of all three factories is estimated to increase by 59 per cent to 597,000 tons of cement by 1973. '

Inspite of a slight fall in turnover the Corporation's profits increased by Rs. 6.0 million (33 per cent) to Rs. 20 million in 1972 while the return on capital employed was 11.6 per cent.

( 68 )

The overall utilization of installed capacity was 63 per cent. The low utilization of capacity in the Galle plant is largely due to the absence of an uninterrupted supply of clinker.

At present the Corporation is exploring the possibility of exporting a part of its output after the commissioning of Stage II of the Puttalam Cement Works. In 1972 the Corporation earned Rs. 6 thousand by exporting cement.

Employment increased from 2,573 in 1971 to 2,628 in 1972

(c) National Small Industries Corporation:

This Corporation which once produced a great variety of products has now handed over most of its activities to a number of other allied Corporations functioning under the Ministry of Industries and Scientific Affairs. Its bricks and tiles factories were handed over to the Ceylon Ceramics Corporation on the 1st of October 1972 and the Carpentry workshops to the Ceylon Plywood Corporation on the 1st of November 1972.

The production of bricks recorded a decline during the year under review. However, the value of total output has increased marginally to reach Rs. 11.2 million.

(d) Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation:

There has been a decrease in the quantum of production in respect of all items manufactured by the Corporation during the year under review. The low utilization of capacity in the production of rutile was due to the inferior quality of mineral sands used. Meanwhile, there has been no production of refined zircon due to the lack of water.

The value of sales recorded an increase of 60 per cent from Rs. 4.5 million in 1971 to Rs. 7.4 million in 1972, on account of better prices obtained for the export of ilmenite. However, inspite of a higher turnover the Corporation's profits remained almost static owing to an increased wage bill. The return on capital employed in production was 12.5 per cent in 1972.

The value of exports also increased from Rs. 4.5 million in 1971 to Rs. 7.2 million in 1972. Meanwhile, the Corporation has planned to set up an integrated Mineral Sands Complex at Pulmoddai by expanding its production facilities with assistance from the Asian Development Bank.

Employment increased from 475 in 1971 to 515 in 1972.

G. Basic Metal Industries

(a) Ceylon Steel Corporation:

The proposal for Stage II of the steel project is being studied by the Corporation. Meanwhile, a steel foundry for the manufacture of carbon and alloy steel is scheduled to be commissioned shortly.

( 69 )

In 1972, there was an increase in the output of both rolled and wire products over that of the previous year. This was reflected in the value of production which increased from Rs. 51 million in 1971 to Rs. 67 million in 1972. However, in view of the limited local demand, production at the rolling mill was confined to 4 0 per cent utilization of capacity.

The sales of rolled products remained almost static, while sales of wire products fell slightly in 1972. The sales turnover increased by Rs. 9.2 million largely due to rise in the selling price. ,

The profits in 1972 were Rs. 7.1 million as against Rs. 1.9 million in the previous year. In 1973 the Corporation anticipates a near doubling of its profits on an estimated higher level of production and sales.

H. Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Equipment

(a) Ceylon State Hardware Corporation:

The output of this Corporation has recorded an increase in 1972. In this year with the gradual exhaustion of imported equivalents and on account of an upward price revision, the Corporation was able to increase its sales turnover by nearly 300 percent, over 1970/71. It anticipates to increase its sales turnover by another 75 per cent in 1973.

The local demand for mammoties at present is in the region of 700,000 per annum and the Corporation has the capacity to manufacture only 480,000 mammoties per annum. With a view to meeting the internal demand the Corporation has plans to expand its capacity at the mammoty plant at Yakkala. In 1971, the Corporation made a loss of Rs. 4.5 million; the financial results for 1972 have not yet been finalised. However, due to the re-organisation in the production programme and a vigorous sales promotion drive, this Corporation may be able to reduce its losses in this year.

4. OTHER PUBLIC ENTERPRISES

A. Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing

(a) Ceylon Fisheries Corporation:

In 1972 there has been an all-round decrease in the output of products of this Corporation with the exception of ice.

The production of canned fish fell by more than half. Sales turnover also dropped from Rs. 10.9 million in 1971 to Rs. 9.6 million in 1972. It may be noted that the fish canning factory worked well below capacity during the year under review.

In this year the Corporation exported wet and frozen fish and shark fins worth Rs. 0.7 million in foreign exchange and it anticipates to earn Rs. 8.7 million in foreign exchange in 1973,

( 70 )

(b) Ceylon State Plantations Corporaiion

In 1972, this Corporation managed 26 plantations and four factories. The total acreage of plantations increased to 32,000 acres, of which 20,849 were planted. The revenue from the operation of plantations increased substantially to reach Rs. 25.8 million during the year under review. Taken together, (plantations and factories) this Corporation recorded an enhanced profit of Rs. 1.6 million for the 15 month period ended December 1972 compared to Rs. 0.4 million in 1970/71. According to provisional data for 1972, however, the Corporation incurred a loss of Rs. 0.14 million on the management of factories compared to a profit of Rs. 0.03 million in the previous year.

B. Transport, Storage and Communications

(a) Ceylon Transport Board

The Board has imported buses and bus chassies to the value of Rs. 30.8 million during its financial year ended 31st September 1972 as against Rs. 26.5 million in the previous year. This helped to narrow the gap between the required number of vehicles and the available effective fleet.

In 1971/72 the scheduled mileage increased by 10.7 million miles while the operated mileage increased by 29.8 million miles over the previous year. It may be noted that the Board was successfull in reducing the lost mileage caused by breakdowns and non-availability of crews at the required time from 64.3 million miles in 1970/71 to 50.1 million in 1971/72. Meanwhile, dead mileage due to empty travel of buses from garages to starting points etc. increased slightly.

Employment continued to increase and in 1971/72 the total workforce was 51,301 or 3,161 more than in the previous year. Number of employees per bus on available effective fleet was on an average 8 in 1971/72, as against 10 in 1970/71.

The Board's expenditure increased by Rs. 46 million to Rs. 412 million in the year under review. The Wage bill of the Board increased from Rs. 203 million in 1970/71 to Rs. 225 million in 1971/72. The greater increase in expenditure was offset by an increase in revenue. However, this was inadequate and the Board sustained a loss of Rs. 10 million compared to a loss of Rs. 56 million in the previous year.

(b) Colombo Port Commission

Revenue which has shown an upward trend since 1967/68 increased marginally from Rs. 50.5 million in 1971 to Rs. 51.3 million in 1972. Meanwhile, working expenditure, which has been increasing over the years, showed a marginal fall from Rs. 30.5 million in 1971 to Rs. 30.2 million in 1972. The Port Commission has recorded an overall surplus of Rs. 2.5 million in 1972 as against Rs." 3.0 million in the previous year. In 1972 the wage bill amounted to Rs. 28.5 million while the total work force was 8,456 persons.

(c) Port (Cargo) Corporation:

The cargo handled by the Corporation continued to decline in 1972. This was primarily due to the decline in the cargo handled at the Ports of Colombo and Galle. Both revenue and expenditure of the Corporation fell marginally while the loss has increased from Rs. 9.2 million in 1971 to Rs. 9.4 million in 1972. However, profits from the Colombo Port rose slightly.

The capital investment of the Corporation in 1972 was Rs. 55.4 million, representing an increase of Rs. 1.1 million over the previous year. This was in respect of the Trincomalee Port. All three ports have recorded a decrease in employment.

Certain salient aspects on the operations of the Corporation during the last five financial years are shown in Table II (C) 8.

(d) Port Tally and Protective Services Corporation

Total expenditure increased by Rs. 0.5 million to Rs. 8.1 million in 1972, while the total income of the Corporation from services rendered increased by Rs. 1.6 million to reach Rs. 11.2 million. On account of the higher increment in income the Corporation reduced its losses by Rs. 0.2 million and the loss in 1972 was Rs. 0.6 million.

( 73 )

(e) Postal and Telecommunication Services

The expenditure on Postal Services increased by Rs. 5.4 million in 1971 while income increased by Rs. 2.8 million. On account of the higher increment in expenditure this Department made a loss of Rs. 5.1 million from its postal services compared to a loss of Rs. 2.4 million in the previous year.

In the case of Telegraphic Services, an increase in income set off a similar increase in expenditure and the overall loss was Rs. 1.7 million in 1971. The higher increase in income from Telephone Service set off a small increase in expenditure and a profit of Rs. 7*5 million was recorded in 1971 as against a loss in the previous year.

Thus the commercial accounts of the above mentioned major activities of the Postal Department have shown an overall profit of Rs. 0.5 million in 1971 compared to a loss in 1969/70.

C. Wholesale and Retail Trade

(a) Co-operative Wholesale Establishment

Certain basic statistics relating to the C.W.E. for five years ending 1972 are given in Table II (C) 9.

The working capital at the end of 1972 was estimated to be Rs. 45.2 million compared to Rs. 66.4 million in 1970. During the year under review the C.W.E. has purchased locally goods amounting to Rs. 94.7 million while its value of imports amounted to Rs. 240-2 million. Of this import bill, Rs. 229.6 million was accounted for by food items. The drop in sales in 1972 by Rs. 38 million was mainly on account of import restrictions and the transfer of some of its activities to other institutions.

The C.W.E. made an estimated profit of Rs. 8.5 million as against a profit of Rs. 15.5 million in 1971. The contribution to Consolidated Fund in 1972 was Rs. 8.0 million. Employment increased from 6184 in 1971 to 6333 in 1972.

(b) Ceylon Petroleum Corporation '

Since the end of 1969 this Corporation shifted from the import of refined petroleum products to purchase from its own Refinery arid Blending Plant.

The total sales revenue which has been progressively increasing over the years stood at Rs. 582.1 million in 1972 as against Rs. 508.6 million in 1971. Sale of petrol, kerosene and furnace oil declined in 1972 while sale of diesel showed an increase.

The foreign exchange earnings of the Corporation recorded a decline from Rs. 84.5 million in 1971 to Rs. 69.3 million in 1972. The net trading profit has increased progressively in recent years and the profit in 1972 was Rs. 64.6 million as against Rs. 51.2 million in the previous year.

With the nationalisation of the marine bunkering trade this Corporation became the sole bunkering authority in all ports in Sri Lanka. The nationali­sation of aviation refueling activities commenced in 1971 and the Corpotation is now the sole supplier of aviation fuel.

(a) Ce*y!on Electricity Board

Data on operations of the Board in 1971 along with comparable data pertaining to the former Department of Government Electrical Undertakings are shown in Table II ( C ) 11.

The generation of power showed a substantial decrease in 1971. Total revenue in 1971 declined to Rs. 115.0 million due to decreased earnings from electricity sales.

Inspite of a decrease in power generated and sold, expenditure recorded an increase in 1971, largely on account of interest and annuity charges on loans. Nevertheless, the Board recorded a profit of Rs. 42.6 million in 1971 compared to Rs. 28.3 million over the preceding 15 month period. The Board contributed Rs. 5 million to the Consolidated Fund in 1971.

The data relating to 1972 were not available.
