1. Introduction

Figures on employment and unemployment are not collected on a regular basis. Data would be available from 1971 census but it will take some time before the relevant figures are available for analysis. The Department of Census and Statistics conducted a Socio-Economic Survey of Ceylon covering a period of two months starting from 1. 11. 1969. According to the results of this survey 557,000 persons were unemployed while 3,518,000 persons were employed. Thus the unemployed comprised 14 per cent of the work force.

The available figures of some relevance on a monthly basis are the number of registrants for employment or better employment with the employment exchanges in the island. These figures are incomplete estimates of the numbers unemployed. However.they would broadly indicate trends.

With a view to supplementing these figures the Central Bank conducts an annual inquiry into employment in the public sector. The Bank also obtains information on employees registered under Employees Provident Fund (E. P. F.) for which the latest available data are for the year 1971. The E. P. F. figures by themselves are incomplete as there are a number of Approved Private Provident Funds (A.P.P.F.) which are outside the scheme. An attempt was made to achieve completeness by requesting these funds to supply relevant employment figures.

2. Number placed in employment by Employment Exchanges

The annual figures of the number of persons placed in employment by employment exchanges from 1960 to 1972 are given in Table II (J) 1. The total number of persons placed in employment by employment exchanges during the year 1972 was 3293. The numbers placed in employment in 1972 in respect of all categories of workers (except in the semi-skilled group) are less when compared with those of last year; the total placed in employment fell by 8 per cent.

3. Employment in the Public Sector

The response to the annual survey conducted by the Central Bank for the

year 1972 in respect of employment in semi-government institutions (public

corporations, universities, research institutes, boards, etc.) was good. To a similar inquiry into employment in the government service, the response from government departments was fair. Figures for those government departments which did not respond to the inquiry were obtained from the Estimates of Government Revenue and Expenditure for 1970/71 and 1971/72, which give the approved

cadre but not necessarily the numbers in actual employment.

The employees are classified according to categories and status (permanent,

temporary and casual). The categories considered were.-

1. Administrative, technical and professional officers of staff rank;

2. Subordinate employees;

3. Minor employees;

4. School teachers (in case of government departments) ;

5. Others.

(a) Government Departments

The estimates of employment in government departments for the years 1971

and 1972 are shown in Table II (J) 2.

As the table shows, the employment statistics in respect of the government departments also include data on government school teachers. The government school teachers accounted for about 29 per cent of the total in both 1971 and

1972. In 1972, about 58 per cent of the total number of employees were in the subordinate and minor grades. Of these, subordinate employees accounted for

32 per cent while the minor employees accounted for 26 per cent of the total. The pattern of distribution among various categories was roughly the same as in

1971. Officers in the staff rank comprised 26 per cent of the total.

The share of the permanent employees to the total remained the, same, being 87 per cent in both years. Those in the temporary grades increased from 5.1 per cent in 1971 to 5.8 per cent in 1972. However, the casual workers have decreased from 13 per cent in 1971 to 6 per cent in 1972.

The total number of employees in the government departments increased by 6.7 per cent in 1972. The officers in the subordinate grades recorded the highest increase 10.6 per cent over the figure for 1971. The number in the administra­tive grades, school teachers and minor employees recorded increases of 9.6 per cent, 2.9 per cent and 6.9 per cent respectively.

( 192 )

The rate of absorption into employment in semi-government institutions increased in 1972. The percentage increases in the total employment in 1972 and 1971 were 13.1 and 3.3 respectively. This increase in the rate of expansion was reflected mainly in the categories of administrative officers and minor employees and their rates of expansion were 16.0 and 20.5 per cent respectively. The corresponding rates in 1971 were 9.4 and minus 2.4 respectively. The percentage rate of expansion in the category of subordinate employees were roughly the same in 1972 and 1971.

In 1972 about 52 per cent of the employees in semi-government institutions was in the category of minor employees. The corresponding figure for 1971 was 49. In 1972 the proportion of subordinate employees and administrative officers were roughly the same.

In 1972, about 83 per cent of the total employees were in the permanent category while the corresponding percentage for 1971 was about 81. Casual employees accounted for about 11 per cent in 1972 while in 1971 the corresponding figure was about 12 per cent. Both in 1972 and 1971 temporary employees accounted for about 6 per cent of the totals.

4 . (a) Employees registered under the Employees' Provident Fund The latest available figures of the number of employees registered under the E. P. F. are for the year 1971. In 1971 there were 34,460 employments contri­buting to the E. P. F. as compared to 23,159 employments in 1970; an increase of 49 per cent. This increase is partly due to the broadening of E. P. F. coverage to include all employers. Previously the establishments employing less than three workers were exempted from contributing to the E. P. F. Apart from private sector employees, the E.P.F. also covers some of the large Corporations, such as, the Port Cargo Corporation and the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment. The employees registered with the E. P. F. have been classified according to main industrial categories in the Table II (J) 4 below for the years 1967 to 1971.

( 194 )

Of the total number of employees registered with the E. P. F. in 1971, 66

per cent were in Agriculture, 13 per cent in Manufacturing and 12 per cent in

Trade and Transport. The pattern of distribution among the main industrial

categories has been essentially the same as in the past years. The number of

employees registered under the E. P. F. rose by 7.0 per cent in 1971 from the

total figure for 1970. The average annual growth in the number of registrants

for the period 1967/71 was 4.6 per cent. In 1971, the largest increase occurred

in Other Agriculture (46 per cent), while there were substantial increases in

Trade and Transport (19 per cent), Manufacturing (18 per cent), and Services

(8 per cent).

The Table II (J) 5 gives the distribution of registered employees under the

E. P. F. according to industry and district as at the end of 1971.

Of the total number of registered employees under the E. P. F. 23 per cent were in industries situated in the Colombo district, 15 per cent in Kandy, 10 per cent in Ratnapura and 8 per cent in Badulla. District-wise the pattern of distribution of registered employees has been almost the same as in the previous

years. Of the total number of registered employees in the Colombo district,

41 per cent were in Manufacturing, 31 per cent in Trade and Transport, and

16 per cent in Services. Most of the employees in other districts were in

agricultural pursuits.

(b) Employees in Approved Private Provident Funds (A.P.P.F.)

During the year, the Central Bank requested these funds to furnish the number of members in the Funds and the description of the main business in which the members were employed. The response was satisfactory. In the case of those funds for which the replies were not obtained, the Bank had to rely on the returns sent by the Labour Department. The Table II 0 ) 6 given below shows the industry-wise classification of employees registered under A.P.P.F.

( 195 )

The registered employees in the A.P.P.F include the staff of some of the large corporations and institutions such as the Ceylon Transport Board and the Ceylon Electricity Board.

The percentage increase of the employees in A.P.P.F. in 1972 was L4. In 1972 largest increases have occurred in Mining and Quarrying (by 23.4 per cent) and Services (by 16.8 per cent). Decreases were recorded in Export Agriculture (by 9.2 per cent) and the unclassified category of occupations (15.4 per cent). The Other Agriculture and Manufacturing have recorded increases of 6.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively. The increases in Construction and Trade and Transport were negligible.

Both in 1972 and 1971 the highest precentage of the employees was in the Trade and Transport group representing 45.7 per cent and 46.2 per cent respecti­vely. Services accounted for about 20 per cent and 17 per cent of the total number of employeess in 1972 and 1971 respectively. The corresponding percentages for Export Agriculture were 8.5 and 9.5. The proportion of employees in Other Agriculture and Quarrying was negligible both in 1971 and 1972.

5. Registrants for Employment:

The number of registrants at employment exchanges for employment or better employment at the end of 1972 was 445,422 compared with 437,400 at the end of the previous year. In 1972, the registrants for technical and clerical employment decreased by 7,140 whilst the decrease for the previous year was 2,793. In the skilled category, the number registered in 1972 was 579 and this was less than in 1971. In 1971 and 1972, the number of registrants for unskilled work was roughly 21,800 and 12,500 respectively.

6. Labour Relations.

The data for 1972 on the number of strikes, the number of workers involved and the number of man-days lost in the private sector are shown in Table II ( } ) 8.

In 1972, the number of strikes in the plantation sector was 164 as compared with 125 in 1971. An increase was also noted in the number of workers involved in strikes from 50,847 in 1971 to 52,112 in 1972. However, the number of man-days lost decreased by 180 to 273,351. In the category of 'Other Employment' however the number of strikes was less in 1972 than in 1971. There was also a remarkable drop in the number of 'workers involved' and the 'man days lost' i.e., from 39,955 workers in 1971 to 2,205 workers in 1972 and from 239,760 man days lost in 1971 to 25,081 man days in 1972.

In 1971 in comparison with the figures for 1970 there was a decrease of < about 51 per cent in the total number of strikes. The situation changed in 1972 and the number of strikes rose by 31 p£r cent over that of 1971. The total number of strikes that took place in 1972 in plantations was 164, of which 108 occurred during the last 6 months of the year.

Wage disputes were less important than general working conditions in the strikes of 1972; nearly 28 per cent of the work stoppages were on account of demands for better working arrangements and disputes with junior staff. However, despite the enforcements of the 'essential services order' there was no decline in the number of strikes in 1972.
