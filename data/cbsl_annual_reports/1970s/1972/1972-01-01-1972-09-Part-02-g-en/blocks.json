Since 1971/72, however, food subsidy is presented on a gross basis as part of expenditure and profits from food sales as part of revenue. Hence, both the expenditure and revenue for 1971/72 would be overstated by the amount of profits from food sales of Rs. 43 million (pro-rata) in the same year. If an allowance is to be made for this factor, the increase in total revenue over 1970/71 would still beRs. 424 million (or 15 per cent) while the increase in total expenditure would amount to Rs. 461 million (or 11 per cent).",

The increased receipts from these sources and other minor increases in revenue more than offset the decreases in revenue which occurred mainly in respect of profits from sale of foodstuffs (Rs. 37 million) export duties (Rs. 32 million) and import duties (Rs. 24 million). The increased receipts from FEECs were mainly the result of a large volume of deferred payments which were made during the course of the year, particularly in respect of sugar imports effected by the Food Commissioner in the previous year. The increased volume of sales of arrack, accounts for the substantial increase in the revenue from this source, while the increase in the rate of excise duty on tobacco by Rs. 5 per pound explains the increased receipts from Tobacco Tax. The increase in Turnover Tax collections occurred due to better enforcement efforts by the Department of Inland Revenue. The Department in the course of its enforcement effort inspected nearly 5,000 places of business, in addition to registering 2,500 new businesses. The revenue from Railway and Posts and Telecommunications, which were adversely affected by the unsettled conditions in the country during 1970/71, showed increases of Rs. 30 million and Rs. 20 million respectively, partly aided by the increase in tariffs during the course of the financial year.",

    "text": "The noteworthy increase in total revenue, despite the substantial increase in expenditure, has helped to limit the resulting Budget deficit to Rs. 1,707 million. This deficit on a pro-rata 12 months basis would amount to Rs. 1,366 million, which is only 39 million more than that of the previous financial year. The deficit of Rs. 1,707 million was financed by a substantial domestic market borrowing of Rs. 1,004 million, foreign finance of Rs. 598 million and a com' paratively heavy non-market borrowing (net administrative borrowings) of Rs. 249 million. The excess from these sources after meeting the Budget deficit helped to augment cash balances (including foreign aid counterpart funds) by Rs. 144 million. It should, however, be noted that due to the interruption in the flow of revenue receipts to the Government, during the three months when employees of the commercial banks were on strike, the Government was com\u00adpelled to raise Rs. 300 million by way of Treasury Bills (domestic market borrowings). The end of the strike just before the close of the financial year enabled the realisation of cheques drawn in favour of Government departments and helped to build up Government cash balances to the unusually high level of Rs. 144 million at the end of the financial year under review1. The debt repayments during 1971/72 amounted to Rs. 412 million. Hence, the net cash deficit for the year was Rs. 1,295 million.",

The major supplementary estimates were on account of pensions and public service pro\u00advident funds (Rs. 31 million) interest payments on public debt (Rs. 30 million) and Armed Forces (Rs. 23 million). During the course of the year, supplementary provisions chargeable to capital votes amounting to Rs. 79 million were also passed by the Assembly. Despite this, capital expenditure has been less than what was originally provided for, mainly due to substantial under-expenditure in respect of these provisions.",

Towards financing this deficit, domestic market borrowing contributed Rs. 82 million less than originally forecast. Foreign finance, too, fell short of original expectations by Rs. 114 million. These shortfalls were more than offset by domestic non-market borrowings i. e. net administrative borrowings of Rs 249. million not originally anticipated in the Budget.

Yet the persistent increases in recurrent expenditure over the years have continuously outstripped the increases in revenue and led to, at best, insignificant surpluses or, at worst, deficits in the Govern\u00adment's current account. It is clear that a more positive approach to curtailing recurrent expenditure, particularly transfer payments, is called for if the notable gains achieved on the revenue side are not to be frittered away. The required increase in the Government capital expenditure, in an enviornment in which the Government seeks to assume greater responsibility for promoting production, has led to progressive increases in the Budget deficits recorded over the years. While this in itself need not cause any great concern, the inability of the Govern\u00adment to generate sufficient and self sustaining surpluses in its current account requires a greater attention in the future.",

Foreign resources, which contributed nearly 45 per cent of the Budget deficit in 1968/69, have since then contributed a gradually declining proportion of the Budget deficit. In 1971/72, while it is true that their share had increased once again to 35 per cent, the actual receipts of foreign finance have consistently been lower than the receipts expected in the Budgets, during the last few years1. While a decline in relative share of foreign finance may represent a shift towards increased mobilisation of domestic resources, the consequent growth in domestic debt and problems of its servicing have also to be carefully looked into.

As compared with 1970/71, net receipts of foreign assistance increased by Rs. 50 million while resources mobilized from domestic non-bank market sources decreased by the same amount. Administrative borrowing increased by Rs. 58 million, while borrowing from the banking system increased by Rs. 133 million. Allowing for the increase in cash balances (including foreign aid counterpart funds) of Rs. 115 million the net expansionary impact in 1971/72 (12 months) was lower than that of the previous year by Rs. 107 million. As observed earlier, the unsually high cash balances built up at the end of the financial year were due to the Bank strike and appear likely to be a temporary phenomenon. Equally fortuitous is the extent of the increase in bank borrowing, particularly through Treasury Bills, which was necessitated by the interrupted flow of receipts to the Government during the Bank strike.",

On the other hand, the Government's indebtedness to the commercial banking system amounted to Rs. 73 million consisting of Rs. 75 million in Treasury Bills partly offset by a repayment of Rs. 2 million in respect of Rupee Loans. The net effect of these operations was an increase of Rs. 283 million in the liability of the Government to the banking system. When reduced to a pro-rata twelve months basis, this shows an increase of Rs. 226 million as com\u00adpared with the increase of Rs. 94 million in the previous financial year. The net resources mobilized by the Government from domestic non-bank sources amounted to Rs. 552 million which on a pro-rata 12 months basis amounts to Rs. 442 million as compared with a sum of Rs. 492 million mobilized in 1970/71.

    "text": "The increase in 1970/71 over the previous year had been Rs. 39 million (or 7 per cent). This was mainly on account of an increase of Rs. 50 million in the subsidy on rice partly offset by decreased subsidies of Rs. 5 million on dhal, Rs. 1 million on locally produced red onions and Rs. 2 million on red onions. The value of rice ration coupons surrendered in lieu of repayment of loans by co-operative societies also reduced the subsidy by Rs. 3 million. During 1970/71 there was an increase of 345,000 long tons of rice issued under ration and increases in the purchase of imported and local rice of 130,000 tons and 239,000 tons respectively. The increased issue of rice under ration was con\u00adsequent to the decision to issue an additional measure of rice on a payment of 75 cents per measure with effect from September 26, 1970. Despite this, the increase in the subsidy on rice was only Rs. 50 million. This was entirely due to a fall in the average landed cost of imported rice from Rs. 780/- to Rs. 655/-per long ton. Thus, the effect of this price decrease more than offset the effect of an increase in total issues of rice under ration. It should also be noted that per unit subsidy on imported rice is lower than that on local rice. The successful avoidance of demurrage expenses helped keep the distribution expenses and other charges at the level of the previous year, although the issue of rice under ration increased.",

    "text": "In 1971/72 (12 months) the gross food subsidy increased by Rs. 44 million or 7 per cent. This increase occurred despite a reduction in the subsidy on rice by Rs. 22 million. For the first time in several years the sale of flour has resulted in a loss and contributed substantially to the increase in the gross food subsidy. The declining trend in the profits from the sale of flour in recent years has been essentially due to the increase in the landed cost of wheatVflour set against a sale price which was hardly revised in keeping with the cost trends2. Consequently, in 1971/72, the hitherto dwindling profits were converted into a loss of Rs. 60 million. While it is true that the adoption in 1971/72 of the practice of netting off the distribution expenses against the profits earned on the sale of this item contributed to the losses,3 the fact remains that it would still have registered a loss of Rs. 36 million even if such expenses have been excluded. In 1971/72, the average landed cost of wheat flour increased from Rs. 722/- to Rs. 735/- per long ton. This higher price contributed to the increase in the subsidy on flour inspite of a reduction in its consumption by 30,000 tons. In contrast, the subsidy on rice decreased in 1971/72 by Rs. 22 million. This was the combined effect of a decision to increase the price of the second measure by 25cents to one rupee, and the consequent reduction by 106,000 long tons in the draw-off of the second measure of rice under ration. A reduction in the purchase of local rice by 54,000 tons and a fall in the average landed cost of imported riee from Rs. 655/- to Rs. 581/- per long ton also contributed to the reduction in the subsidy on rice. Meanwhile, consequent to the ban on the import of red onions, the subsidy on locally produced onions was eliminated, while the purchase of locally grown chillies at guaranteed prices resulted in a subsidy \u2022 of Rs. 7 million. The losses incurred on the sale of certain other food items like dhal and infants' milk food also registered increases of Rs. 6 million and Rs. 2 million, respectively. The sale of the latter item was handled by the Food Commissioner for the first time.",

The subsidy on flour is estimated to increase by Rs. 56 million and distribution expenses by Rs. 8 million, while the subsidy on rice is expected to be Rs. 4 million less. The increase in the subsidy on flour is a result of the anticipated increase in the average landed cost of flour from Rs. 735/- to Rs. 962/- per long ton. At the retail prices prevailing at the time when the estimates were approved, this would involve a subsidy of Rs. 263/- per ton to consumers in Colombo and Rs. 231/- per ton to consumers in outstations4. The proposal to withdraw the issue of free rice under ration to income tax payers and their dependants is expected to reduce the rice subsidy by Rs. 25 million.

During the financial year 1971/72, this greater reliance on foreign aid continued and increased the foreign debt component of gross debt to 23.2 per cent. Although the absolute increase in domestic debt was much higher than that of foreign debt, in proportionate terms the increase in domestic debt of 14 per cent during the financial year 1971/72 is much lower than the increase of 33 per cent in foreign debt.

Consequently, the share of the group of securities of 10 to 15 year maturity, which more than doubled during 1970/71, increased further, and now accounts for nearly 30 per cent of total domestic debt. The share of securities maturing in 20 to 25 years has decreased from 29 per cent at the end of 1968/69 to 9 per cent at the end of 1971/72. The maturity pattern of the funded debt reveals that there exists scope for spreading the debt repayment burden more evenly through the issue of long term Rupee Securities. Particular attention has now to be paid to avoiding large bunching of repayments in certain years which is bound to create budgeting problems to the Government with its ever increasing needs for finance. The fact that 'captive' sources of funds have, in the recent past, become the major contributors to the Government loan programme should facilitate this task of managing the Public debt. Attention has also been drawn to the increasing interest burden of the Public debt elsewhere in this Report.2",

Apart from the enhanced rates of contributions to provident funds which came into effect during 1970/71, the attraction of a higher interest rate, together with the shortening of the period of maturity of Rupee Securities may have helped to sustain the support from this source. The decline in the contributions from private insurance companies over the years is a reflection of their need for greater liquidity and the consequent decline in their investible funds. Meanwhile, the contributions from individuals, clubs and institutions too, have recorded a decrease after registering a significant increase in 1970/71.",

    "text": "The increase in holdings of non-bank sector was due mainly to increases of Rs. 119 million in holdings of savings institutions (currently by the National Savings bank), Rs. 196 million of sinking funds, Rs. 205 million of Employees' Provident Fund, Rs. 59 million of other provident funds and Rs. 69 million of the Insurance Corporation of Ceylon. The decrease in holdings by the bank sector was almost entirely due to a fall of Rs. 50 million in the holdings of the Central Bank. This fall was consequent to repayments of maturing stock held by the Central Bank. There was no increase in holdings of commercial banks despite their subscriptions of Rs. 47 million, since this sum consisted of converted maturing securities.",

Sinking fund investments are usually accumulated in Treasury Bills during the three months prior to a repayment of a rupee loan and are used up at the time of repayment. Sinking funds held Treasury Bills to a value of Rs 41 million at the end of 1970/71 and had no such holdings at the end of 1971/72.

Under-expenditure is calculated on capital expenditure excluding Sinking Fund contributions and direct repayments of public debt. Under-expenditure in respect of capital expenditure as per Approved Estimates Includes a sum of Rs. 100 million being economies anticipated as a result of decentralisation of Capital Programmes. (b) However, the Estimates as approved by the Assembly provide for Bank borrowings of Rs. 100 million. The decrease in bank borrowing shown here, is on account of the fact that the increase of Rs. 10 million in expenditure on increased minimum producer prices for rubber as announced in the Budget Speech, is not reflected in the Estimates as approved by the Assembly. This has been done presumably because the additional expenditure on such relief is now considered not to be necessary in view of the post-budget increase in the price of rubber. Yet, the Approved Estimates continue to show the expected bank borrowing as Rs. 100 million.",
