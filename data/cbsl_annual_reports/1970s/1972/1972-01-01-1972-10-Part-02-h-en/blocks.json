In rupee terms, there was an increase in export earnings of 1.6 per cent in 1972, but this was very largely the result of the adjustments of exchange rates. In terms of foreign currency, there was in fact a slight drop in export receipts, the primary cause of which was a decline in the export quantum of tea. In 1971, the disruptions caused by insurgent activity, may have contributed to the fall in output, while, in 1972, adverse weather may ha/e been partly responsible. There is, however, some evidence thit the fall in the volume of tea and rubber exports is partly the result of efforts by producers to economise on their operating expenses. Considering that Sri Lanka is continuing to depend on these two industries for 73.1 per cent of export earnings this is clearly a disquieting trend.",

Recognising the long-term limitations of a policy of exclusive reliance on import substitution for a country in Sri Lanka's circumstances, the Five-Year Plan places considerable emphasis on the rapid development of exports. Total export earnings are assumed to increase to Rs. 2,710 million by the end of the Pian period. Yearly targets for export earnings have not been fixed, but it is clear that with each year that passes without a noticeable increase in export earnings, the task of earning Rs. 2,710 million by the end of 1976 will become that much more difficult. Since the ability to finance the investment contemplated in the Five -Year Plan depends on the availability of the required foreign exchange, a short-fall in export targets can have serious repercussions on the success of the Plan.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka had to decide whether to allow the exchange rate of the rupee to be determined in a fixed relationship to the Pound Sterling, as had been customary, or to forge a new link with the U.S. dollar. The main argument in favour of maintaining the link witlvthe Pound was that Sri Lanka had a sizeable trade with the Sterling Area. A link with sterling would have helped to keep stable the rupee receipts\" of exports to and the rupee payments for imports from, the Sterling Area. At the same time, there were even more forceful arguments for establishing a link with the dollar. Since, after the float, the dollar had depreciated against Sterling, maintaining a fixed relationship between the rupee and the Pound, would have amounted to a revaluation of the rupee against the dollar. The consequences would then have been that Sri Lanka's exporters to the Dollar Area would have realized less rupees for their exports, while imports from the Dollar Area would have been cheaper in rupees. Neither of these consequences was desirable from the point of view of the balance of payments. Another important argument for a dollar-rupee link was that several countries which were in competition with Sri Lanka in export markets, had moved with the dollar. These matters were the subject of careful study by the Government, and in November 1971, the decision was taken to re-align the exchange rate with the dollar. When the float of the U.S. dollar ended with the Smithsonian Agreement, new exchange rates were fixed based on the previously existing relationship between the U.S. dollar and the rupee.",

    "text": "It soon became necessary to review those decisions when, in June 1972, the Pound Sterling was allowed to float. All the previous arguments for linking the rupee to the Pound Sterling still remained valid, while additionally, account had to be taken of the fact that failure to re-link the rupee to the Pound, would adversely affect Sri Lanka's export trade with the Sterling Area. Accordingly, on 8th July 1972, exchange rates for the rupee were revised on the basis of a fixed relationship with the Pound Sterling. Since the balance of payments position of Sri Lanka did not warrant a revaluation of the rupee against a major currency, the implementation of these decisions irdirectly resulted in a mild depreciation of the rupee against major currencies. This depreciation afforded some much-needed relief to domestic exports (particularly those exports which do not qualify for Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates), while also making some small contribution towards restraining the demand for imports.",
