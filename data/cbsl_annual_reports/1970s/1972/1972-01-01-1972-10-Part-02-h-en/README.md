1. General

Stringent restriction of the quantity of imports helped, brice again, to limit the adverse balance in commodity transactions to a level consistent with foreign exchange earnings and aid. The deficit in the merchandise account was Rs. 302 million. Grants from foreign governments helped to bring down the deficit in the current account to Rs. 269 million. The net inflow of long'term capital (mainly in the form of commodity and project aid) amounting to Rs. 294 million, was more than sufficient to offset the current account deficit. Consequently, there was, once again, a surplus of Rs. 25 million, in the "basic balance".2

As compared with the previous year, however, the performance of the balance of payments in 1972 was disappointing. In 1971, the surplus, in the "basic balance" was as high as Rs. 188 million. The worsening of the basic balance was primarily the result of the reduced flow of aid. Grants fell by Rs. 24 million, while the net inflow of long-term aid declined by Rs. I l l million. As a result, unlike in 1971, it was not possible to achieve any reduction in the country's dependence on short-term credits for financing payments.

(OT'TROVISIONAR""' m^mircTr^eMrlT^ankoi^effoiu Apart from the fact that the 1972 performance is less satisfactory than that of 1971, another disquieting feature is that the factors responsible for Sri Lanka's long-standing balance of payments weakness continue to manifest themselves. The prices of Sri Lanka's imports are rising inexorably, for reasons largely beyond her control. The contributory causes are.- •

1. Owing to the prolonged strike in the commercial banks which took place in the bst quarter of 1972, methods different to those of previous years have had to. be adopted in estimiting the balance of payments. In previous years, full details of the foreign exchange transactions of commercial banks were available for preparing the balance of payments estimates. At the time of writing this Report, such detailed info;mation was available only for the first half of 1972. The gap in information has had to be filled by projections The estimates for 1972 are therefore to be regarded as highly provisional. 2. The "Basic balance" is derived by setting off the current account balance against net long-term capital receipts.

( 168 )

(1) The wage-price inflation in the advanced countries, which has raised the ptices of Sri Lanka's manufactured imports,

(ii) sharp increases in the prices of petroleum products, as a result of the successful pressure applied by the oil producing countries to obtain better prices for their petroleum exports,

(iii) high prices of certain food items such as sugar, which was in short-supply throughout the year, and rice and wheat during the last quarter,

(iv) Sri Lanka's increasing dependence on short-term and long-term credits for financing her imports, and the resultant weakening of her ability to make purchases from the cheapest source.

While the constant increase in import prices has imposed a considerable strain on Sri Lanka's external resources, new sources of pressure have emerged during the last few years. Interest payments on Sri Lanka's past borrowings claimed over 6 per cent of her export proceeds in 1972. Capital repayments on long-term debt required another 6 per cent. In addition, there is a large volume of short-term debts, which has to be re-cycled by borrowing afresh.

From a long-term point of view, more disturbing is the stagnation in export earnings observable during the last few years. In rupee terms, there was an increase in export earnings of 1.6 per cent in 1972, but this was very largely the result of the adjustments of exchange rates. In terms of foreign currency, there was in fact a slight drop in export receipts, the primary cause of which was a decline in the export quantum of tea. In 1971, the disruptions caused by insurgent activity, may have contributed to the fall in output, while, in 1972, adverse weather may ha/e been partly responsible. There is, however, some evidence thit the fall in the volume of tea and rubber exports is partly the result of efforts by producers to economise on their operating expenses. Considering that Sri Lanka is continuing to depend on these two industries for 73.1 per cent of export earnings this is clearly a disquieting trend.

A further reason for disappointment with the 1972 performance is that it was the first year of the new Five-Year Plan. Recognising the long-term limitations of a policy of exclusive reliance on import substitution for a country in Sri Lanka's circumstances, the Five-Year Plan places considerable emphasis on the rapid development of exports. Total export earnings are assumed to increase to Rs. 2,710 million by the end of the Pian period. Yearly targets for export earnings have not been fixed, but it is clear that with each year that passes without a noticeable increase in export earnings, the task of earning Rs. 2,710 million by the end of 1976 will become that much more difficult. Since the ability to finance the investment contemplated in the Five -Year Plan depends on the availability of the required foreign exchange, a short-fall in export targets can have serious repercussions on the success of the Plan.

Policy responses to this situation must inevitably centre on the further restriction of dispensable consumer imports, and on the provision of greater incentives for exports. The year 1972 witnessed some progress in both these areas. In August 1971, when the U.S. dollar was floated, the Government of

( 169 )

Sri Lanka had to decide whether to allow the exchange rate of the rupee to be determined in a fixed relationship to the Pound Sterling, as had been customary, or to forge a new link with the U.S. dollar. The main argument in favour of maintaining the link witlvthe Pound was that Sri Lanka had a sizeable trade with the Sterling Area. A link with sterling would have helped to keep stable the rupee receipts" of exports to and the rupee payments for imports from, the Sterling Area. At the same time, there were even more forceful arguments for establishing a link with the dollar. Since, after the float, the dollar had depreciated against Sterling, maintaining a fixed relationship between the rupee and the Pound, would have amounted to a revaluation of the rupee against the dollar. The consequences would then have been that Sri Lanka's exporters to the Dollar Area would have realized less rupees for their exports, while imports from the Dollar Area would have been cheaper in rupees. Neither of these consequences was desirable from the point of view of the balance of payments. Another important argument for a dollar-rupee link was that several countries which were in competition with Sri Lanka in export markets, had moved with the dollar. These matters were the subject of careful study by the Government, and in November 1971, the decision was taken to re-align the exchange rate with the dollar. When the float of the U.S. dollar ended with the Smithsonian Agreement, new exchange rates were fixed based on the previously existing relationship between the U.S. dollar and the rupee.

It soon became necessary to review those decisions when, in June 1972, the Pound Sterling was allowed to float. All the previous arguments for linking the rupee to the Pound Sterling still remained valid, while additionally, account had to be taken of the fact that failure to re-link the rupee to the Pound, would adversely affect Sri Lanka's export trade with the Sterling Area. Accordingly, on 8th July 1972, exchange rates for the rupee were revised on the basis of a fixed relationship with the Pound Sterling. Since the balance of payments position of Sri Lanka did not warrant a revaluation of the rupee against a major currency, the implementation of these decisions irdirectly resulted in a mild depreciation of the rupee against major currencies. This depreciation afforded some much-needed relief to domestic exports (particularly those exports which do not qualify for Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates), while also making some small contribution towards restraining the demand for imports.

Two important measures affecting the balance of payments were introduced in the new Budget. These were-

(a) an increase in the rate for Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates from 55% to 65%, and

(b) the subjection to Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates of a large variety of imports which were previously exempt.

These two measures should give a further fillip to non-traditional exports, while helping to keep in reasonable balance the demand for imports •

( a ) Merchandise Account ;•.

The adverse balance of Rs. 287 million in the merchandise account in 1971 is estimated to have increased to Rs. 302 million in 1972. The larger deficit was caused by a rise in import expenditures, which increased by 2.1 per cent from Rs. 2,218 million in 1971 to an estimated Rs. 2,265 million in 1972, despite a reduction in quantity. As mentioned, above, a part of the increased expenditure was due simply to the higher rupee > valuation attached to imports as a result of the adjustment of exchange rates, but partly too, it was the result of a further rise in the foreign prices of imports.

Export earnings increased by 1.6 per cent from Rs. 1,930 million, to Rs. 1,963 million. In the case of exports, increased earnings were primarily due to exchange rate changes. In terms of foreign currency, however, export earnings declined by 1.9 per cent, mainly due to a lower volume.

(b) Services and Transfers

Table II (H) 4 sets out. estimates on the services account. A sharp reduction in the deficit in the services account is observable in the last two years. In 1971, the deficit in the services account had reduced to Rs. 14 million, as compared with Rs, 102 million in the preceding year. In 1972, the deficit remained at the same level as in 1971.

Receipts .from tourism, which received a minor set-back in 1971 due to the insurgency, show definite signs of revival. They are estimated to have increased from Rs, 20 million to Rs. 32 million- On the payments side, the large outflow through investment income is due principally to the larger interest payments due on Sri Lanka's growing foreign debt.

( 174 )

In the case of transfer payments, the increased outflow on the private account can be attributed to the faster pace of repatriation under the Indo-Ceylon Agreement. Receipts from official transfer payments represent grants received from foreign countries and institutions, either in the form of cash or goods. They recorded a decline from Rs. 105 million to Rs. 82 million.

Taking services and transfer payments together, there was a surplus of Rs. 34 million, which helped to bring down the deficit on current account to Rs. 269 million.

(c) Capital Account

The total resource gap which had to be financed in 1972 was Rs. 1,303 million, as compared with Rs. 1,372 million in 1971. The inflow of long-term official capital i.e. through commodity and project aid, fell from Rs. 498 million to Rs. 414 million. Repayments on account of such loans increased from Rs. 96 million to Rs. 124 million. As a result, the net inflow of official long-term

capital declined from Rs. 402 million to Rs. 290 million.

The fall in the net inflow of long-term capital, made continued resort to short-term credits inevitable. During the year, the total amount of such credits obtained was Rs. 665 million, as compared to Rs. 716 million in 1971. Repayments made on such credits, however, fell from Rs. 679 million to Rs. 620 million. Thus, in 1972, the volume of short-term credits outstanding increased by Rs. 45 million, as compared with an increase of only Rs. 37 million in 1971.

In 1972, a drawing of U.S.S 14.75 million, under the scheme for Compensa­tory Financing of Export Fluctuations, and drawings of U.S.$ 10.5 million under the stand-by agreement of the previous year, resulted in receipts totalling Rs. 163 million. A further Rs. 19 million was credited to the I. M. F. as charges payable in rupees. Repayments on past drawings totalled Rs. 170 million. The net indebtedness to the I. M: F. thus increased by Rs. 12 million, in contrast to a:

reduction of Rs. 41 million in 1971.

Under the third annual instalment of the first allocation of Special Drawing Rights, Sri Lanka received such rights to the value of Rs. 62 million. '

2. External Assets

Despite the adverse out-turn in the balance of payments, Sri Lanka's external assets increased in 1972. by Rs. 187 million.* The assets of the Central Bank increased by Rs. 47 million, those of the commercial banks by. Rs. 135 million, while Government's assets also increased by Rs. 5 million. . •-,

The increase in external assets, it should be emphasized, does not represent an improvement in the balance of payments. Rs. 62 million of the increase simply represents the allocation of Special Drawing Rights. Against the balance increase must be considered the increase in short-term liabilities of commercial banks of Rs. 68 million, and the increase in the Government's short-term liabilities of Rs. 46 million.
