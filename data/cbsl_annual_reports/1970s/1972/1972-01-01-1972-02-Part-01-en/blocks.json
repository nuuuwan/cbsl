When allowance is made for the population increase of 2.1 per cent in 1972 the increase in real product per person was only 0.4 per cent. The increase in total real product was largely due to an expansion in output of goods for domestic use, specially livestock products, fish, subsidiary food crops and coconut. This increase offset the fall in output of tea, paddy and rubber. Income generated by the manufacturing sector rose by only 1.6 per cent in real terms because its output growth was adversely affected by the shortage of raw materials arising from the foreign exchange constraint. Construction activity declined mainly as a result of a shortage of building materials.",

The Approved Estimates for 1971/72 expected a total revenue of Rs. 3,945 million.

Reduced to a pro-rata 12 - month basis this represents an increase of Rs. 403 million over the revenue collections of 1970/71. The significant increases in revenue were in respect of sale of FEECs, profits from the sale of arrack, Business Turnover Tax and tobacco tax. The large volume of deferred payments, particularly those made by the Food Commissioner in respect of sugar imports effected earlier, helped to increase FEECs revenue by Rs. 140 million. The profit from the sale of arrack was mainly, accounted for by the substantial increase in the volume of sales, while the increase in the rate of tobacco tax contributed to an increase in revenue from this source.",

The cash balances, however, stood at Rs. 144 million. This unusually high balance at the end of the financial year is to be explained partly by the fortuitous circumstances consequent to the banks strike.",

Although successful and determined efforts have been made to mobilise additional domestic resources, the absence of a more positive approach towards curtailing current expenditure, particularly transfer expenditure, resulted in revenue gains being merely frittered away in non-development expenditures. The increase in capital outlays in 1971/72 has been very small. As long as transfer payments make a heavy claim on available resources, the realisation of development aims will be thwarted by having less money to finance the development efforts. The past Annual Reports have drawn attention of the Government to its inability to generate adequate current account surpluses to finance the larger portion of development expenditure. As long as the scale of such outlays on transfers are not kept within limits aims of development will be frustrated.",

On the other hand, market borrowings from non-bank sources have come to contribute substantially towards financing the deficits in the last three years. Correspondingly, the servicing of debt has also begun to raise problems of finding resources to meet the interest payments. Interest payments have increased at 20 per cent per annum (compound) during the last five years, which is nearly double the rate of increase in the previous five years.",

This amount was almost entirely contributed by the banks. The Government had to issue Treasury Bills to tide over the temporary cash shortage which arose principally from the fact that cheques received by various government departments, amounting to about Rs. 153 million, were not credited to government accounts because of the strike. Bank credit to the private sector (net of time and savings deposits) too, showed a very large increase of Rs.219,5 million, mainly due to the relatively free use of overdraft facilities necessitated by the strike. While it is impossible to quantify the precise effects of the banks strike on monetary expansion, the facts discussed tend to show that the real increase in money supply would have been markedly lower than the rate of 15.3 per cent shown by the available statistics.",

    "text": "Price developments in 1972, as reflected by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index, showed a significant difference from those of the previous year. The average of the Colombo Consumer's Price Index went up by 6.3 per cent in 1972, compared to a modest increase of 2.7 per cent in 1971. It should, however, be noted that there was a steady increase in prices throughout the year under review. The index itself, though it may not reflect the actual increase in prices, was kept in check by price control measures, rationing and subsidising of items that entered mass consumption. However, to promote local production through price incentives, prices of a few items, including r\".d onions and chillies, were de-controlled. Nevertheless, the large shortages relative to demand pushed up prices. Shortages of imported goods and of domestically produced items, and several other factors exerted an upward pressure on prices. The currency realignments together with the adjustment of freight rates was intensified by the inflationary tendencies that prevailed abroad. The increase in Business Turn\u00adover Tax and the FEEC rate influenced the increase in prices in the last\" quarter of the year.",

    "text": "The full impact of some of these factors on prices may not have been experienced in the year under review. In the absence of a reliable indicator the impact of monetary forces cannot be measured in any precise manner. The banks strike during the last quarter of 1972 would also tend to conceal any possible effects the monetary assets would have on prices. Available data, however, indicate that money supply rose by 15.3 per cent in 1972 compared to an increase in G. N. P. of 7.1 per cent. Thus, in the last quarter of 1972 pressure on prices emanated both from a higher velocity of circulation of money and a larger volume of money pumped into the economy to meet a temporary cash shortage of the Government resulting from the banks strike.",

The continuing sluggishness in the economy, on the other hand, called for some relaxation of existing restrictions. Since a determined effort was being made by the Government to keep bank borrowing within limits, the Central Bank considered that a limited expansion in bank credit to the private sector would be consistent with the objective of monetary stability. The ceilings which were in force in the past few years were lifted with effect from 1st April, 1972. However, in order to guard against any undue expansion, the reserve ratios were maintained at the existing levels. Banks were also asked to refrain from increasing credit for non-essential purposes, such as, consumption, speculative stock building, etc., over the level of such credit as on 31st March, 1972. Bank Rate continued to remain at 6\u00a3 per cent.",

    "text": "It is not always possible to assess the performance of the Plan by using aggregate measures of economic growth, such as, the growth of Gross National Product or of per capita income. It is well understood that simplistic notions of national income analysis are inadequate measures of economic growth. The non-achievement of overall growth targets within a short period would also indicate that a larger number of instruments are required to be applied in the following years. A case in point is afforded by the overall growth of 2.4 per cent in Gross Domestic Product in 1972, compared to the Plan target of 6.1 per cent. This indicates that in the next four years the average rate of growth has to be stepped up to 7-0 per cent annually to keep to the required target. However, this aggregate measure very often overlooks or under- estimates the contributions of planning in the provision of social infra-structure, the redistribution of income and a higher degree of social justice. Furthermore, an assessment of the Plan from only one year of its operation may not be meaningful as the targets can fluctuate from year to year so as to yield the average rate of growth as planned.",

    "text": "Very often the large farmers lack adequate capital and managerial ability to make their farms economically viable to utilize all available capacity most effec\u00adtively to raise employment, income and output. Small holdings have been found to be viable alternative to large farms in most countries that carried out land reforms. At the very beginning the marketed output may fall because small farmers often consume a large volume of their own production. This would mean that total output will be kept almost constant, if not more, in the short run, whilst raising the standard of living of the bulk of farmers. A short term loss in output, however, is possible when large farms in which output per acre is higher than the output that is likely to be obtained on a small farm at present are redistributed. However, in the long run, economically viable small holdings will prevent the build-up of excess capacity in agriculture by more intensive land use, so that a large number of families geared to labour intensive methods can be settled. It is estimated that the area available for redistribution will be 450,000 to 500,000 acres. Assuming that an economically viable holding is between 3 and 5 acres, eventually 100,000 to 150,000 families can be settled under the scheme. Initially, the support necessary to implement such a programme, both administratively and financially, would be rather demanding.",

The cumulative effect of uncer\u00adtainties regarding the private sector would have resulted in a postponement of their investment decisions.

It depends on the foreign policies of donors, the mood of their legislators and on their balance of payments situation. Sri Lanka's credit-worthiness is also reviewed by the donors from year to year.

Though the import programme has been pruned to admit only of essentials, a combination of unfortunate circums\u00adtances - steadily rising prices of manufactured goods imports and latterly of agricultural food imports - has reduced to a most inadequate level the imports of industrial raw materials and capital equipment. Low, and in many instances technologically unwise, capacity utilization in industry is widespread. If the best long-term prospects for development rest on industry, a process of emanci\u00adpation of industry from its present constraints must be set in motion. It is from this point of view that a critical look is needed at the items of mass consumption -rice, flour and sugar - with a view to effecting notable economies. About Rs. 750 million (or a third of the total import bill) is spent on these three commodities. No doubt a higher level of domestic production will reduce the import requirements. This can affect the balance of payments only with a lag. However, a breakthrough on consumption levels can have an immediate and lasting effect on the balance of paymtnts.

    "text": "In an unchanged situation, the \"external bottleneck\" will severely limit growth. A mobilization of domestic savings alone is not a sufficient condition for achieving a satisfactory rate of economic growth. Effective development, parti\u00adcularly industrialisation, is dependent on a continuing flow of imported raw materials etc. An increase in domestic savings adequate to finance a larger volume of physical investment need not by itself ensure that the type of investment appio-priate to rapid growth would take place if the import requirements that are technologically necessary for the process are unobtainable. But in obtaining foreign assistance to support the development efforts, Sri Lanka has to be cautious lest she is pushed into a position, by reason of her payments difficulties to have recourse to external credit of a type that will make her even more import dependent.",
