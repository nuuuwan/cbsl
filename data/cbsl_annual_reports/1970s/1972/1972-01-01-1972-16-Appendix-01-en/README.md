And provided further that such accomplice shall be called as a witness by the Commission or the counsel assisting the Commission and tendered for cross examination:

And provided further that, if such accomplice gives evidence which is, in material particulars, different from such confession or statement, the Commission may disregard the evidence given by such accomplice and act on such confession or statement.

(3) Where, in the opinion of the Assessor, any person chargeable with any tax for any year of assessment has paid as the quarterly instalment of that tax for that year of assessment an amount less than the proper amount which he ought to have paid as such instalment, the Assessor may, within that year of assessment or within six years after the expiration of that year of assessment, assess the amount which in the judgment of the Assessor ought to have been paid by such person and shall by notice in writing require such person to pay forthwith the difference between the amount so assessed and the amount paid by that person:

106.

(3) Where, in respect of any income tax, wealth tax or gifts tax which is due from the estate of a deceased person, an executor of such deceased person, on or before the date he is required to pay such tax or any instalment thereof satisfies the Commissioner that such tax or instalment cannot be paid on or before such date owing to probate or letters of administration not being granted to him, such sum or instalment shall not be deemed to be in default if it is paid within a period of two months after the date of the grant of probate or letters of administration.

In this subsection, the expression " executor " does not include any person

(5) Tax shall be paid notwithstanding any appeal against the assessment, unless the Commissioner orders that payment of the tax or any part thereof be held over pending the result of such appeal, and the amount of the tax or part

thereof so held over shall be deemed not to be in default.

(6) Where the Commissioner is of opinion either that the tax or any part thereof held over under subsection (5) is likely to become irrecoverable, or that the appellant is unreasonably delaying the prosecution of his appeal, he may revoke any order made under that subsection and make such fresh order as the case may appear to him to require and the amount of any tax not paid on or before such date as may be specified in the fresh order shall be deemed to be in default.

(7) Where, upon the final determination of an appeal under Chapter XII, or upon any order made by the Commissioner, any tax which has been held over under subsection (5) becomes payable or the tax charged by the original assessment is increased, the Commissioner shall give to the appellant a notice in writing fixing a date on or before which any tax or balance of tax shall be paid. Any tax not so paid shall be deemed to be in default.

(8) Notwithstanding anything in this section, where there is an appeal against an assessment and where the payment of the tax is held over on the order of the Commissioner, the Commissioner, if the appellant agrees during the course of that appeal that a certain sum is due or is likely to be due as tax in respect of that assessment, may by notice in writing given to the appellant direct the appellant to pay such sum on or before such date as is specified in the notice.

Any sum not so paid shall be deemed to be in default and for the purposes of this Act the person by whom such sum is payable or, where such sum is payable by more than one person or by a partnership, then each of such persons and each partner in the partnership shall be deemed to be a defaulter.

(9) Where any tax or instalment thereof is in default, a sum equivalent to five per centum of the amount in default shall be added to the tax or instalment thereof and the Commissioner shall give notice in writing to the person by whom the tax or instalment thereof is payable requiring him to pay the tax or instalment thereof together with the sum so added on or before a date specified in the notice, and if payment is not so made, the Commissioner may add a further sum or further sums not exceeding fifteen per centum of the tax or instalment thereof in default until the tax or instalment thereof is recovered:

(Cxxxviii)

Provided that no sum or sums shall be added under the preceding provisions of this section if any sum or sums under Chapter XlA have been added to such tax in default.

(10) Where, upon the final determination of an appeal under Chapter XII, any tax in default to which any sum or sums under subsection (9) has or have been added is reduced, then such sum or sums shall be calculated on the tax as so reduced.'.

24. Section 118 of the principal enactment is hereby amended by the repeal of subsection (1) of that section and the substitution therefor of the following new subsection .-
