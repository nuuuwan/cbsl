( B ) INDUSTRIAL P R O D U C T I O N

1. Introduction

Data relating to industrial production and employment for the year 1972 were obtained by means of a questionnaire addressed to industrial units in the private and public sectors. In the case of a few big industrial firms a postal questionnaire was, issued and was followed up by personal visits with a view to expediting the collection of data. The response by industrialists to the questionnaire, despite the short time given, was very satisfactory. In all, 1,913 completed questionnaires were returned. Of this number about 15 per cent indicated that they were not engaged in production in 1972. Most of these industrial units were the relatively small ones and one of the main reasons they adduced for inactivity in 1972 was the lack of imported raw materials.

The value of industrial production1 in 1972 was Rs. 2,442.4 million, representing an increase of Rs. 234.7 million or 10.6 per cent over 1971. The number of reporting units in 1972 was 1,913 while in 1971 the corresponding figure was 1,897. The value of production of industrial firms that reported both in 1971 and 1972 increased by Rs. 185.1 million or 9.7Lper cent. This figure because of its comparability is a better indicator of industrial performance in 1972. However, since the value of output is susceptible to changes in the price level the former may show an increase even with a decline in volume. In 1972, price increases in industrial products ranged from 6 to 20 per cent over the 1971 level. The Colombo Consumers' Price Index rose by 6.3 pet cent. In the light of these factors it would appear that the increase in prices largely accounted for the increase in the value of production.

2. Location of Industry

Table II (B) 9 shows that industries are highly concentrated in the Western Province, and there are relatively few industries located in other regions. Even in the Western Province industry has tended to concentrate in and around Colombo. Approximately 80 per cent of the total value of industrial production was contributed by industries situated within a radius of 20 miles from the metropolis. The Western Province alone accounted for 92 per cent of the total value of industrial production and had nearly 80 per cent of the industrial units located within its boundaries. The other provinces have lagged far behind, and their individual contributions to the total value of industrial production have been very small. Government's policies as embodied in the Five Year Plan, particularly those relating to road transport in the rural areas, the development of the internal telecommunication system on a selective basis, and its programme of rural electrification are designed to enhance the investment climate in the regions and pave the way for the dispersion of industry.

1. The production figures in this section are not given in real terms and to a large extent show the increase in the values that have taken place as a result of sharp price increases in the period under review. A production index reflecting changes in the volume of output could not be constructed in view of the short time available between the receipt of data and the publication of the Annual Report.

3. Production

The increase in the value of production in 1972 over the preceding year at current prices was Rs. 234.7 million or 10.6 per cent. This was relatively smaller than the increase of 13.5 per cent in 1971. The price increase in most industrial goods was more than the increase in the value of output and was mainly responsible for the increase in value of output.

It is not possible to quantify the inhibiting effects on industry of the shortage of imported raw materials.

Public sector industrial corporations increased the value of their production from Rs. 568.9 million in 1971 to Rs. 871.1 million in 1972 increasing their share in the value of total industrial production from 25.7 per cent to 35.6 per cent. The number of employees in these corporations also showed a substantial increase, rising from 29,895 in 1971 to 35,981 in 1972.

Three main tables and two supplementary tables on industrial production are presented in this section. The first table, II (B) 1 gives a broad statistical summaty of production and employment for the years 1969 to 1972. Table II (B) 2 gives production data classified by industry and principal products for the years 1968-1972; while Table II (B) 3 gives production data in respect of industrial units that reported both in 1971 and 1972.

Industrial units engaged in the manufacture of Food, Beverages and Tobacco accounted for 32.7 per cent of the total value of production and was the largest industrial category. Additionally, in 1972 these industries showed an increase of Rs. 55.7 million in output. Within the industrial group Food, Beverages and Tobacco, the sub-groups Food preparations and Tobacco because of their agro-industrial character are not too heavily dependant on imported raw materials. Industrial units which belong to these sub-groups are Dairy Products, Salt, Vegetable oil, Desiccated Coconut and Tobacco.

All major categories, as evident from Table II (B) 1 showed increases in the value of production. The only exception to this was the Industrial category Non-metallic Mineral products (except Petroleum and Coal) which recorded a decline in value of Rs. 3.5 million. In the case of Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather Products and industries manufacturing Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Transport Equipment output rose by Rs. 88.3 million and Rs. 31.3 million. Their share in the total value of industrial production was 16.1 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively.

Table II (B) 2 gives data on the performance of industrial sub-groups within the main industrial groupings and are particularly relevant for an analysis of those main industrial groups that have expanded or contracted during the year. The industrial group-Food, Beverages and Tobacco showed a substantial increase in the value of production. The expansion was in the two sub-groups viz., Food preparations and Tobacco where production increased by 22.7 per cent and 39.1 per cent respectively. The increase in the value of Food Preparations was very largely due to the increase in the value of output by State Corporations in this field.

A large increase in the value of production was recorded by the industrial group Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather industries. This was mainly due to the increase in the value of output recorded by the sub-group Spinning, Weaving and Finishing of Textiles.

The increase was appreciable and amounted to Rs. 81.8 million or 48.2 per cent. This increase is largely explained by the increase in the output of the National Textile Corporation. In the industrial group Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Transport Equipment, the recorded expansion in production was almost exclusively due to the sub-group Machinery (except Electrical) and Transport equipment which increased its output from Rs. 57.3 million to Rs. 98.9 million, an increase of 72.6 per cent. This reported increase in the value of production was due to the receipt of data from a few big industrial units that were not covered in the 1971 Survey. In the other industrial groups, the only sub-group to show a marked increase in production was Petroleum and Coal Products, in the industrial group Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal, Rubber and Plastic Products. The increase in value recorded by this sub-group was Rs. 61.0 million or 30.7 per cent and was due to the increase in the value of Petroleum and Petroleum products manufactured by the State Petroleum Corporation.

The industrial group Non-metallic Mineral Products (except Petroleum and Coal) showed a small decline in production although there were no significant changes in the value of output of the individual sub-groups; other than in Cement, Cement products and Asbestos products where there was a marginal fall of Rs. 6.3 million. This was mainly due to a fall in the output of Asbestos products, perhaps, due to the inadequacy of imported raw materials.

Supplementary Table II (B) 2 (1) gives a classification of industrial sub­groups according to increases in the value of production. Food Preparations, Petroleum and Coal products and Spinning and Weaving recorded the highest increases in value, where each of these sub-groups increased their value of production by Rs. 50 million or more. These groups appear to be growing rapidly, because in the preceding year too they increased their production value appreciably. The sub-groups Tobacco, and Machinery (except Electrical) showed increases in value ranging from Rs. 20 to Rs. 50 million. Paper products and Iron and Steel which showed increases in value of Rs. 5 to 20 million in 1971 have continued to do so in 1972. Other groups of industries which now fall into the latter category are Beer, Stout, Arrack, Footwear and Leather Products, Electrical machinery and Manufactured products, n.e.s.

Supplementary Table II (B) 2 (2) shows the changes in the number of industrial units in the 9 major industrial groups and the corresponding change in the value of production during the period 1971-72. It is evident from the Table that there has been a drop in the number of reporting units in all but two industrial groups, although the total value of production has increased. Only one industrial group-Non-Metallic Mineral Products (except Petroleum and Coal) recorded a fall in the value of output and that despite an increase in the number of reporting units. The biggest drop in the number of reporting firms was in the industrial Group - Food, Beverages and Tobacco, where the number of reporting firms declined by 223. This decrease is explained by the Sri Lanka Tobacco Industries Corporation1 having submitted a consolidated statement of data covering almost all small beedi manufacturing units. The increase reco'ded in this industrial category was Rs. 55.7 million. The industrial group - Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather, showed a marked increase in its production despite a marginal increase in the number of reporting firms. The increase was largely due to the sub-group Spinning, Weaving and Finishing of Textiles which increased its production value by 16.1 percent. In this sub-group there was also an increase in the number of reporting units in 1972. But this was almost offset by a fall in the number of reporting units in Garments and other Apparel (except Footwear). The other significant contributions to production value came from the group manufacturing Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Transport Equipment, where value of output increased by Rs. 31.3 million despite the number of reporting units in this group in 1972 dropping by seven. As already indicated this was due to the submission of production data by a few big firms who had not reported in 1971.

The number of units that reported in both years was 959 which is 50 and 59 per cent of the number that submitted data for 1971 and 1972, respectively. The change in the value of industrial production as reflected here is undoubtedly a better comparative guide to industrial performance in 1972, than the absolute figures of production value given in the two preceding Tables.

The aggregate value of output of the 959 reporting units in 1972 was Rs. 2,083.1 million as against Rs. 1,898.7 million in 1971; an increase of 9-7 per cent. Despite the increase in the value of output the overall performance of industry in 1972 as evident from Table II (B) 3 is somewhat disquieting. Seven industrial groups recorded increases in the value of production, but only two of these groups, namely Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal, Rubber and Plastic Products and Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather Industries, showed substantial increases of Rs. 97.9 million and Rs. 47.8 million, respectively. In the former the increase was due to two sub-groups, namely Petroleum and Coal Products and Miscellaneous Chemicals while in the latter it was due entirely to the sub-group Spinning, Weaving and Finishing of Textiles. The other seven industrial groups recorded relatively small increases, while two industrial groups recorded a fall in the value of output. In addition, eight industrial sub-groups also showed a decline in the value of output in 1972. They were:

(1) Preserved and Canned Fruits, Vegetables, Meat, Fish and other Sea Foods. (2) Biscuits, Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery.

(3) Beverages. (4) Knitted Fabrics. (5) Glass and Glass Products. (6) Bricks and Tiles. (7) Fabricated Metals. (8) Manufacture of Ilmenite.

The fall in the value of output as recorded by these industries has not been very substantial, but viewed in conjunction with the marginal increases recorded by most of the others and the price increases in 1972, the overall performance of industry has not been very satisfactory.

4. The Structure of Industry

The structure of industry in Sri Lanka has been influenced largely by the availability of foreign exchange and the nature and size of the domestic market. Manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka showed a significant increase in the wake of the import controls that were introduced in the sixties and intensified thereafter. Consumer goods industries have in the last decade been the dominant industrial group, their share in total production while it has fluctuated marginally has not declined. This category increased its'relative share in industrial production from 49.9 per cent in 1971 to 51.8 per cent in 1972,

The domestic market characterised as it is by shortages of industrial goods has been a powerful incentive for producers of consumer goods. The nature of the response can be gauged from the increase in the production

of consumer goods. Table II (B) 4 gives data on industrial production classified by major economic categories from 1968-1972. In 1968 the

total value of consumer goods produced was Rs. 6953 million while in 1972 it was Rs. 1,265.0 million. In the consumer goods category, Food, Beverages and

Tobacco have been the fastest growing industries having more than doubled its production value between 1968 and 1972. Another rapidly growing category in the consumer field is Miscellaneous Chemicals which almost doubled its output in the same period.

The share of intermediate goods in the total value of production has declined from 38.2 per cent in 1971 to 35.5 per cent in 1972. The entry of the State Petroleum Corporation into this field of industrial activity has lent considerable stability to this sector. The value of Petroleum and Coal

Products has risen sharply between 1968 and 1972 from Rs. 8.3 million to

Rs. 259.5 million respectively.

Output of industries producing investment goods has more than doubled in the period 1968-1972; despite this its relative share in the total value of industrial production has been more or less static. The entry of State enterprise into the field of manufacturing, with its investments strongly biased in favour of the production of intermediate and investment goods has tended to gve more balance to the structure of industry in Sri Lanka.

Data on the size distribution of industrial units based on the value of output is given in Table II (B) 5. It shows that industrial production in all sectors is very highly concentrated in a few units. The concentration is most marked in Basic Metal Products, manufacture of Chemicals, Petroleum,

Coal, Rubber and Plastic products and Non-metallic Mineral products (except Petroleum and Coal). The industrial groups Manufactured products n.e.s. and Food, Beverages and Tobacco show the least degree of concentration.

5. Employment and Wages

In 1972 there was an appreciable increase in the total number of employees in industry; the number rose from 110,141 in 1971 to 123,986, an increase of 12.6 per cent. This increase occurred in two industrial categories viz., Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather products and industries manufacturing Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Transport equipment. These two industrial groups increased the number of their employees from 22,568 to 32,908 and 15,089 to 21,483 or 45.8 percent and 42.3 per cent respec­tively. The industrial group Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather industries was the largest employer and accounted for 26.5 per cent of all industrial employees. The total of man-days worked in the industrial sector also showed an increase, rising from 26,232 to 31,610 an increase of 20.5 per cent.

SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF M A N U F A C T U R I N G FIRMS 1972,

BASED ON V A L U E OF O U T P U T

( 43 )

Total wages paid put by industry rose sharply in 1972, the increase was as much as 31.4 per cent. The main industrial groups where the wage bill rose were Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather products and Non-Metallic Mineral Pro­ducts (except Petroleum and coal) which increased their wage bill by 68.3 per cent and. 45.0 per cent respectively. Wage per man-day in industry as a whole increased from Rs. 10.67 in 1971 to Rs. 11.63 in 1972. Wage per man-day was the highest in the industrial category Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal and Plastic products where the average wage per man-day recorded Rs. 18.36 and lowest in the category Manufactured Products, n.e.s. with a wage per man-day of Rs. 8.20.

Data relating to the size distribution of industrial units based on the wage bill are given in Table II (B) 6. This table indicates clearly that employment and wages are very highly concentrated in the big industrial units and is most evident in the industrial group Non-Metallic Mineral products (except Petroleum and Coal) and industries manufacturing Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal, Rubber and Plastic Products. The only industrial group that does not exhibit a high degree of concentration is Food, Beverages and Tobacco.

6. Use of Raw Materials

Table II (B) 7 indicates that more than 50 per cent of the cost of production consisted of the value of raw materials. Imported raw materials accounted for 77 per cent of the total value of raw materials.

Only two industrial groups showed a relatively low utilisation of imported raw material. They were Wood and Wood Products including Furniture and Non-Metallic Mineral Products (except Petroleum and Coal). Imported raw material in these two industries accounted for 7.9 and 34.6 per cent of the total value ofraw materials. Four industrial groups imported more than 80 per cent of the value of its raw material. They were-

1. Basic Metal products (96.1 per cent)

2. Manufacture of Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal, Rubber and Plastic Products (92.2 per cent)

,3. Manufactured products n.e.s. (82.1 per cent); and :4. Industries manufacturing Fabricated Metal products, Machinery, and Transport equipment (81.9 per cent).

In the industrial group Food, Beverages and Tobacco the dependence on imported raw material varies according to sub-group and product, while Vegetable Oils and Fats and Tobacco have little or no import content. Others such as Confectionery and Biscuits depend a great deal on imported inputs-Table II (B) 7 also shows the foreign exchange earned by the major industrial groups. The industrial group Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal, Rubber and Plastic products show the highest foreign exchange earnings, with foreign exchange receipts of Rs. 71.3 million or 21.7 per cent of the foreign exchange value; of its raw materials. The other industrial groups that earned appreciable foteign exchange were Food, Beverages and Tobacco and Non-metallic Mineral products (except Petroleum and Coal). Their export receipts amounted to Rs. 16.9 million arid Rs. 11.7 million.
