The main contributory factor towards this decrease was the channelling of trade with Pakistan through the Asian Clearing Union from the beginning of 1979. Prior to 1979, all such transactions were routed through U.S. Dollar Credit Agreement. Since the value of exports to Pakistan from Sri Lanka during the year was higher than the value of imports from that country, the net amount payable to Asian Clearing Union in settlement was reduced.",

According to this Scheme, commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka were authorised to operate Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) separate from their domestic banking units. These FCBUs were allowed to accept time and demand deposits, (but not savings accounts or accounts from which funds are withdrawable by cheque), to borrow funds from and extend loans and advances to any non-resident or Greater Colombo Economic Commission enterprise or an approved resident in any designated foreign currency. However, these units were not permitted to accept deposits resulting from Sri Lanka's export proceeds. At present, the currencies which have been designated are the United States Dollar, Pound Sterling, French Franc, Japanese Yen, Netherlands Guilder, Swedish Kroner, Swiss Franc, Deutsche Mark, Hongkong Dollar and Singapore Dollar. In November, 1979 the Foreign Currency Banking Units were authorised to establish, open or advise letters of credit, issue guarantees, indemnities or similar undertakings, and discount bill? and acceptance in the designated foreign currencies provided that, the parties to such transactions are non-residents and Greater Colombo Economic Commission enterprises or approved residents.",

The interest payable on these balances amounted to Rs. 302 million, as against Rs. 228 million in 1978. This represented an increase of Rs. 74 million over the previous year. As the full year's interest is paid on the balances standing to the credit of a member as at the end of the year, irrespective of the month when any portion of those balances (which represents contributions) was received by the Fund to the member's credit, the effective rate of interest is somewhat higher than the fixed rate.",
