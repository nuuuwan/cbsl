This achievement, though lower than the impressive growth of B.2 -per cent in the previous year, was an indication that the growth impulses which were generated by the major economic reforms since 1977 have been sustained. Moreover, as in the previous year, economic growth was characterized by progress on a broader front, led lay construction, mining, \u2022electricity, finance, trade and services. Capital formation rose by 25 per cent, reflecting higher investment in the public and private sectors during 1979. Consumption too rose by 12 per cent. Domestic savings indicated a slight downward trend, but when acco.unt.is taken of a higher build up of inventor\u00adies, the savings ratio could have remained at about the previous year's level.",

    "text": "The relative moderation in the .rate of economic expansion in 1979, when compared *vith the previous year, was largely due -to a sluggishness observed -in the agricultural sector, which grew by only 2 per cent in 1979, as against a growth of 5 per cent in the year before. Further, the rates of growth of construction, mining and power-tfhe high growth sectors of 1978-slowed down somewhat in 1979, on account of capacity and resource constraints that emerged during the latter half of the year. Moreover, the economic spurt of 1978 was achieved in relation to a low level of economic activity and capacity utilization in 1977 and hence, it would not be realistic to expect that such a high growth rate to be sustained in the following year.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka's terras of trade deteriorated sharply in 1979, by 28 per cent. A 52 per cent rise in import prices obliterated a 9 per cent improvement in export prices. On the other hand, import volumes in .1979 rose by 23 per cent, while export volumes gained a .meagre 1 per cent. As a result, She .trade gap widened, almost quadrupling the deficit of 1.978. But, this was partly due to a pre-planned higher recourse to foreign resources, as a part of the country's medium-term economic strategy. As a result, and despite substantial improvement in inflows on services and transfers, the current account of the balance of payments recorded an unprece\u00addented deficit, more than twice that of the previous year. Yet, large scale capital inflows and resources from the International Monetary Fund resulted in a modest overall surplus, which went on to augment external assets. Sri Lanka's gross external assets at the end of 19.79 would fee adequate to finance about thtegTaad-half months' imports projected for 1980.",

But, a 35 per cent rise in capital expenditure made the budget deficit 23 percent higher than in J978. Despite foreign resources at last year's levels and much greater domestic resource mobilization, a disconcertingly high financing gap emerged, which had to be met by expansionary bank borrowing. This, along with the substantial growth of external assets, caused a growth in money supply of nearly 29 percent during the year, reversing the moderating trend observed last year.",

    "text": "Reacting to pressures emanating from these sectors, and following the upward revision of certain government-administered prices, inflationary pressures appear to have accelerated, especially during the latter part of the year. Money wages in 1979 rose faster than in the previous year, but with inflation in the region of 2Q per cent, real.wages outside the agricultural sector could have declined. However, there were encouraging signs that the rate of unemployment had declined to about 15 per cent of the workforce in late 1978 (from 24 per cent in 1973). The major improvement appears to have occurred in the estate sector, where the unemployment has halved between 1973 and 1978. Rural unemployment has declined by 37 per cent and that in urban areas, by 34 per cent. Nevertheless, the bulk of the unemployed was in the rural sector. A sharp decline in unemployment was observed among the youth, 14 to 25 years of age.",

The trade sector which contributed to 20 per cent of the growth in 1978, increased its share to 26 per cent in 1979, largely on account of expanding trade in imported and domestic goods. The construction and mining sectors' share has declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent in 1979. The contribution of the manufacturing sector declined from 14 to 11 per cent, on account of a slower rate of growth; while that of finance, administration and other services accounted for a higher share of growth, from 15 per cent to 23 per cent in 1979. Thus, the sectors that contributed most to economic growth in 1979 appeared to be those concerned with trade, finance and services, whose growth could be directly associated with the liberalization of the economy.",

Hence, a higher rate of growth in agriculture and industry could be achieved only by a judicious allocation of public investment between long-term and quick-yielding projects, and by inducing the private sector to invest in short gestation projects by appropriate policy changes. In this: connection, the Government made encouraging policy changes with regard to export taxation in tea and coconut, and domestic pricing and subsidies on rice,. flourt sugar and. coconut during rg7g. All these measures were aimed at improving the producer margins at the expense of the consumer, and they were difficult deci\u00adsions in the context of long-standing protection, of consumers in the country, and the substantial' sacrifice of government revenue these measures, entailed. Nevertheless,, the adequacy of policy measures to- assist these sectors would be a major concern during the forthcoming year. Last year* the Annual Report spotlighted the long\u00adstanding conflict between the need to* assure remunerative margins' to the producer' while ensuring what were deemed to be \"reasonable\"' prices to: the consumer, and stressed the urgent need for a trade-off between the conflicting interests of consumers and producers, in favour of the. latter,, if the country was, to achieve the desired rate of economic growth. It is hardly necessary to emphasize that, in a free economy, where the private sector is expected to contribute the major share of economic growth, a positive response in the important areas. of agriculture and industry will be difficult to achieve unless the deliberate subsidi\u00adzation of consumers' at the expense of producers is. diminatecT.",

In the case of paddy, a record Maha season crop more than compensa\u00adted a decline during the drought-stricken Yala season, and last year's record appears, to; have, been exceeded. In the case of tea, production rose by 4 per cent despite adverse prices; and a decline in fertilizer use. The stable, conditions that prevailed in the industry after the extensive administrative reorganization of the previous year, probably contributed to this improvement. Rubber production declined by 2 per cent,, despite a remarkable improvement in prices. Coconut production was higher by 8 per cent, compared with, a 21 per cent growth in the previous year. Yet, production was well' below the average levels achieved in the early seventies. While some minor export crops, fared better, there was a decline, in others. Minor food crops continued to fare badly, probably on account of liberal supplies of subsidized wheat flour and other imports for buffer stocks,, such as onions, and chillies,, with a view to keeping domestic prices stable. Cane sugar production dropped sharply,, and so did milk production. Fish and egg. production has; been estimated: to have improved. Generally speaking,, this uneven perfor\u00admance of the agricultural sector as: a whole appeared to be the result of the lack of adequate incentives for production on account of various policies adbpted, primarily with ai view to containing sharp increases in the cost of living.",

Two thirds of the increase this year was on account of changes induced by the government in a move to reduce consumer price subsidization in the economy. On the other hand, price increases of imported goods accounted for 55 percent of the rise in the index. Reflecting stronger pressure on prices towards the latter part of 1979, the index in December, 1979 showed an annual rise of 15 per cent. The Central Bank's Wholesale Price Index showed a lower average increase of 9 per cent in 1979, but by December, had risen to 16 per cent, on an annual basis.",

    "text": "Generally,the best available data indicated that inflationary pressures intensified in 1979, especially during the second half. On an annual average basis, price rises in 1979 would have been in the region of 20 per cent, as against an estimated 15 per cent in the previous year. A redeeming feature of this development, however, was the fact that at least a part of this increase arose from the removal of certain subsidies which had kept prices artificially low, which could have a salutory long-term impact of increasing domestic production and incomes. The immediate impact of this increase on the living costs of the poorer classes was cushioned to some extent by the issue of food stamps. Of greater concern was the sharp increase in import prices, reflecting inflation all over the world, and the conspicuous rise in oil prices. By the middle of the year, containing inflationary pressures emerged as the major problem in the economy, and this is likely to continue into 1980 as well, with the international price situation showing no signs of abatement, and the coming on full-stream of the government's major construction activities.",

    "text": "will have to be rationed, but even this would not prevent the emergence of a \"black market\", where the prices will reflect the free market price, plus invariably, a premium for evasion of the laws. Majority of the consumers will have to pay this higher price. A similar situation would occur when prices are regulated to prevent price increases arising naturally from cost increases. If the regulation would result in losses, producers will go out of production and the availability of goods in the market will diminish. This will tend to push prices up further, aggravating the problem. . Efficient rationing thus becomes a sine qua non of successful price regulation, but even the experience of more tightly organized and regulated societies have shown that rationing cannot be kept efficient for too long. It would appear thus, that the common equation of price controls with lower prices and benefits to the consumer does not hold most of the time. Hence, it might be prudent to intervene more judiciously in markets, by measures which would increase the supply of goods, without imposing production disincentives, rather than revert to ad hoc price regulation which would, at best, only have a very short-term deterrent effect. Experience all over has clearly demonstrated that artificial price controls do not benefit the consumer in the long run.",

    "text": "Several wage increases were granted to government and semi-government employees during 1979. Wages in the private sector tended to move up faster, reflecting higher levels of economic activity and short-term labour supply constraints. Real wages in the agricultural sector appear to have risen. It would also appear that a substantial dent in the unemployment problem was made during 1978 and after. As mentioned earlier, unemployment, which stood at 24 percent of the workforce in 1973 has declined to 15 percent in 1978. Most pro\u00adnounced declines in unemployment occured in the estate sector, but unemployment in general became less burdenfome on account of an increase in family incomes. Unemployment was most severe among those with a secondary education (\"GCE passes\"), while unemployment of those with lower and higher education dropped sharply. Also, unemployment at lower age groups (14 - 25 years) appear to have declined. In the 14-18 year agegroup, unemployment declined from 66 to 24 per cent, and in the 19-25 year age group, from 48 to 25 per cent.",

Nevertheless, the trends indicate a substantial improvement of income levels, the mean income in real terms having risen by 38 per cent during the 5 year period 1973 to 1978, as compared with a 12 per cent growth during the ten year period 1963 to 1973. But, the share of income received by the lowest ten per cent of income receivers has dropped from 1.8 per cent in 1973 to 1.5 per cent in 1978, and that of the lowest 40 per cent, has declined from 15 to 12 percent On the other hand, the share of income of the highest ten per centof income receivers has. risen from 30 to 39 per cent. This would depict a shift in the distri\u00adbution of income towards greater inequality, the Gini concentration ratio changing from 0.41 to 0.49 during the 5 year period 1973, to 1978. This ratio is an index of income inequality,, ranging from zero to. one, larger the coefficient, the greater the inequality of incomes.",

Arising from the growth in income and employment, all income categories have made appreciable gains. Despite this, the fact that a large number of persons have become first-time income earners in the lower income categories on the one hand, and the substantial improvement m incomes of highest income category, on the other hand, has resulted in a widening of income disparities, as indicated by the Gini coefficient. It is- also noteworthy that* although all income deciles gained, the only decile that improved its share in 1978 was the highest. Tms was probably inevitable, at early stages of rapid growth, when accrual of profits to new investors who made an early entry into business are relatively greater! on account of lesser initial competition. With greater competition in the economy, a larger spillover of benefits of new economic activity to lower income groups could take place, but this may have to be supported by appropriate fiscal policies. In this context, the rationalization of consumer subsidies, growing importance of indirect taxation and the apparant over-generous grant of direct tax. reliefs, could worsen emerging income disparities*",

But, if economic growth has to have a tangible meaning to the masses, the manner in which the growing prosperity is shared among the people becomes a critical factor. At least at the initial stages, when resources are being consciously diverted from consumption to investment, which will inevitably lead to a lowering of real incomes of the poorer classes, it may be prudent not to be over-generous with concessions such as tax holidays and lump sum depreciation. As emphasized in the last year's Report, an equitable balance between growth and equity will have to be worked out.",

Meanwhile, revenue showed a modest increase of 11 per cent. Thus, the original aim of halancing of the budget with non-expansionary financing could not be realised in 1979. Undoubtedly, sharp cost escalations, during the year and extraordinary commitments arising from the cyclone damage, has made budgeting rather difficult, but prudent anticipation of cost escalations as well as better control on advance account operations, and supplementaries\u201e would certainly help to prevent untoward developments in the future.",

The expansionary impact of fiscal operations, combined with the growth of net external banking assets, made it difficult to contain the growth in money supply within desired limits. As a result, and on account of a sharp rise in import prices, considerable inflationary pressure was evident in the economy. However, the unemployment problem appears to have eased; so that a growth in family incomes, arising from additional employment of family members, may have mitigated the impact of the general rise in prices. These problems are typical of economies which are endeavouring to achieve high rates of economic growth. A right policy climate in the economy, therefore, could make a significant contribution towards overcoming these problems.",

Of special significance in this connection were the public sector investment program in the Accelerated Mahaveli Project and in residential and non-residential construction.

    "text": "One result of the liberalization of the economy has been the high level of activity in the trading sector and in ancillary services. In one sense, this was a-favourable development, because it has resulted in a large increase in employment and incomes. However, it was also possible that there has been a diversion of resources to obtain quick profits in the import trade, as was evident by the sharp growth of 23 per cent, in import-related trade. There were some indications that erstwhile traders, who had taken up to import substitution industry in the early sixties, now have reverted to more lucrative import trade, having abandoned their relatively inefficient industries. The sectoral composition of GNP reflects a slight decline in the share of the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector, but this was mainly due to the slower growth of plantation and domestic agriculture.",

This growth came mainly from the plantation sector, which grew by 4 per cent, reflecting the increases in the production of tea and coconut. Output of domestic agriculture is estimated to have increased by 2 per cent. While paddy production was estimated at 2 million mt. tons (92 million bushels) in 1979, output of minor food crops appear to have declined substantially. The increase in the output of other food crops, forestry and livestock has been only slightly higher than in 1978.",

    "text": "(. The higher level of investment in construction and manufacturing had its_con-comitant in the high level of economic activity in these sectors. Output of the construction sector is estimated to have increased by 18 per cent in 1979. A large part of this increase came from public sector construction, particularly under the Accelerated- Mahaveli Project. It appears that within the construction sector, there was competition for limited resourcesTin which the private house-builder came out second best. Thus, while domestic availability, of building materials, parti\u00adcularly cement and hardware items, has been much higher than in previous years, there were market shortages and priority in distribution has been accorded to public sector building programs. For the same reason, skilled and semi-skilled labour has been attracted to the larger construction projects, because of the prospect of semi-permanent employment. Thus, there appears to have been a dampening of private sector construction activity in house-building. ^",

Measured in real terms, total resources increased by 11 per cent, at the same rate as in last year. This was mainly due to the increase in the weight of imports from 29 per cent of total resources in 1978 to 32 per cent in T979.",

If the inventory growth of the private sector is accurately estimated and reckoned, it is very likely that the savings ratio of 1979 would rise to about the same level as in 1978.",

Of the tree crops, coconut produc\u00adtion recovered from its all-time low level of 1977. Rubber production declined by about 2 per cent, despite a remarkable improvement in prices. Tea production increased marginally, despite deteriorating prices since 1978. Minor export crops fared unevenly, the exports of cinnamon, cloves, coffee and cardamom rising and exports of cocoa, pepper and papain declining. Of the annual crops, paddy production has been estimated to have increased marginally, while the production of other food crops such as onions, chillies and indigenous cereals appears to have been depressed at or below the low levels of the previous year. Cane sugar production which rose by 11 per cent in 1978 dropped sharply by 26 per cent in 1979. Fish production which has been estimated to have risen by 12 per cent in 1978, appears to have grown slower by 9 per cent in 1979. Although the National Milk Board's collections rose by 27 per cent, government estimates of milk production in 1979 indicated a decrease of 7 per cent. Egg production has been estimated to have risen by 20 per cent.",
