    "text": "The overall performance of the manufacturing sector in 1979, was appreciably below the high levels reached during the previous year. The current year may be considered as a period of consolidation following the liberalization of the economy since 1977. Evidently, problems of adjustment persisted during the year, while import competition increased. Nevertheless, import liberalization has made raw materials and spares easily available and has led to greater rationa\u00adlization within industry, resulting from better utilization of production capacities as in the previous year. The pioneer import substitution industries, most of which are more than 15 years old now, faced the problem of modernizing their obsolete machinery.and equipment under conditions of rising costs of imported machinery.",

The inability to adjust themselves to the changing circumstances, even after two years of liberalization and high protection, may be indicative of the high degree of inefficiency inherent in this sector. On the other hand, some small industries, such as those making bricks, tiles and wood products, vehicle body construction and repairs, and rural handicrafts expanded rapidly. Much has been said about the plight of this sector in general and the adverse effects on employment if the non-competitive ones are permitted to go out of produc\u00adtion, but there was no evidence coming from the government or from the consumers of small industry products that they were inclined to meet the cost of subsidizing these, non-competitive and inefficient industries. As a result, there were signs of some small scale industrialists switching over to other areas such as trade and construction.",

    "text": "In terms of current values, the major expanding sectors in 1979 were chemicals, food and beverages, basic metal products, textiles and garments and non-metallic mineral products. When price changes are discounted, the main growth sectors appeared to be food and beverages, basic metal products, textiles and garments, non-metallic mineral products and wood products. There was widespread a growth in the food, beverages and tobacco sector. In the case of textiles and garments, an increase in output of private factories more than compensated a decline in public sector textile mills. The sole steel mill, which is in the public sector, accounted for the entire growth of the basic metal products sector. Expansion in output of cement, bricks and tiles - all related to the construction industry - accounted for the growth in the non-metallic mineral products sector. However, a decline in production in major sectors such as chemicals and petroleum, fabricated metal products and paper, reduced the overall industrial growth to a modest 4 per cent. In the chemicals sector, a 6 per cent decrease in the oil refinery output was largely responsible for the decline.",

The Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) continued to entertain new investment proposals from export-oriented industries. A total of 37 projects, involving an investment of Rs. 1,041 million, with an employment potential of about 13,000 have been approved by the GCEC during 1979. Of these, about 12 firms have firmly committed to set up industries in garments, glass, electrical and mineral products. Of the 52 industries approved by the GCEC in the previous year, 13 industrial units were in operation as at the end of 1979. The total investment in these industries amounted to Rs. 196 million, with about 40 per cent foreign collaboration. The exports of these firms during 1979 have been Rs. 111 million, but in view of their heavy import dependence, value added would have been very low. Majority of these firms were engaged in the manufacture of ready-made garments. As further expansion of such indutstries could create export problems, the GCEC discouraged such industries in 1979.",
