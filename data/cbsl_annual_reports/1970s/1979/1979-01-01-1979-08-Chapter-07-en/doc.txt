According to the Central Bank's annual survey of employment in the public sector, employment in government departments increased by 33,713 or by 5 per cent in 1979. Of this increase, 39 per cent was in subordinate grades, 29 per cent in teaching, and 24 per cent in minor employees grades. In semi-government institutions (Public Corporations and Statutory Boards) employment increased by 89,385 or by 14 per cent. Of this, 83 per cent was in minor employees grades and 14 per cent was in subordinate grades. There was a substantial increase in employment in public sector plantations of 61,000 or 13 per cent. More than two-thirds of the increase in employment in the semi-government sector occurred in the state plantations.

The number of active accounts with the Employees' Provident Fund, which has been used as a proxy to measure annual changes in employment in the insti­tutionalized private sector, indicated that the number of active accounts in 1979 increased by 102,479 or by 10 per cent. When the increase in employment in semi-government institutions contributing to the fund is deducted, the net increase in employment in the private sector in 1979 could be estimated at 22,525.

The above data indicate that, increase in employment in government depart­ments, semi-government institutions and the organised private sector in 1979 was around 136,000 as against 145,000 in 1978. This figure, however, does not include employment creation in non-institutional private sector and in the domestic agri­cultural sector, for which data are not avialable.

Available data indicated that there was an acceleration in the exodus of Sri Lankans seeking employment in Middle Eastern countries during 1979. As some of this migration would cause shortages of domestically available skills^ the educationaL authorities will have to undertake a major training programme at the school level. Also, experience of other countries in similar circumstances have shown that the later return of this migratory labour creates considerable socio-economic problems. Resettlement of these workers in productive domestic employment in the near future should, therefore, deserve early attention.

FOREIGN TRADE

Sri Lanka's balance of trade (on the basis of Customs data) registered a deficit of Rs. 7,287 million (SDR 362 million) in 1979, following a deficit of Rs. 1,480 million (SDR 100 million) in 1978. When Customs data are adjusted for the imports and exports by certain government agencies which get recorded after a

time lag, the trade deficit of 1979 remained the same. The adverse trade position which Sri Lanka experienced in 1979 was certainly a matter of concern, but this really reflected higher recourse to foreign resources as part of the country's medium-term economic stabilization programme. Import expenditure rose fromRs. 14,687 million (SDR 774 million) in 1978 to Rs. 22,560 million (SDR 1,121 million) or by 45 per cent. On the other hand, there was a relatively smaller increase in the export earnings from Rs. 13,206 million (SDR 674 million) to Rs. 15,273 million (SDR 759 million) by 13 per cent.

The increase in imports was the result of the relaxation of import controls since 1977. The volume of imports, as measured by the Import Volume Index (1978 = 100) rose by 23 per cent. Import prices as measured by the Import Price Index (1978 = 100) indicated an increase of 52 per cent. On the other hand, the export performance was rather disappointing. Volume of exports, as measured by the Export Volume Index (1978 = 100) increased by less than one per cent. However, export prices, except that of tea , have shown improvement in 1979. The Export Price Index (1978 = 100) showed a rise of 9 per cent.

The trade liberalization of 1977 was expected to lead to a substantial immediate increse in imports, while the export response was expected to be slower due to supply rigidities, thereby worsening the trade deficit. This did not take place as anticipated, in 1978, probably on account of the slower reaction of impor­ters, who had to re-establish their trade connections. Belatedly in 1979, the origi­nally anticipated, reaction took place, and the trade deficit recorded a near four-fold increase. Despite higher prices, demand for capital and intermediate goods accele­rated, as the general economic climate improved considerably. By contrast, the volume of all major exports tea, rubber and coconut as well as most of the minor agricultural crops declined during the year, due to an uneven production performance arising from adverse weather and problems in management and marketing. With the declining prices of tea, the incentives given by the exchange reform in 1977 was maintained by way of export duty reductions in July, 1979.

Rubber benefited from buoyant prices and an era of stability in rubber trading was indicated with the signing of the International Buffer Stock Agreement in September. Coconut prices too were better in the year, but the country was unable to reap the full benefits due to a shortfall in the volume available for export, resulting from certain export restrictions.

Exports

In 1979, export earnings in rupee terms increased by 16 per cent, while in SDR terms the increase was 13 per cent, showing an improvement over 1978. Earnings from tea and gems declined, while earnings from rubber, coconut, minor agricultural exports, petroleum and industrial exports increased.

The value of tea exports in 1979 amounted to Rs. 5,722 million, indicating a decline of 11 per cent (13 per cent in SDR terms). This was due to a decline in the volume of exports by 3 per cent and a drop in prices by 8 per cent. The average f.o.b. price per kilo of tea exported in 1979 was Rs. 30.51 (SDR 1.52), as against Rs. 33.22 (SDR 1.70) in 1978. The average price of tea sold at the Colombo auctions declined by 14 per cent in 1979 and the average price of Sri Lanka tea at London auctions declined by 9 per cent. In July, duties levied on tea exports were reduced by nearly one-third, while the Tea Board cess increased marginally. As mentioned earlier, the tea industry suffered badly from a liquidity-cum-profit squeeze due to deteriorating prices and heavy taxation. This major industry deserves urgent corrective measures if it is to lead the much desired export growth in a liberalized trade regime.

The value of rubber exports (in rupee terms) rose remarkably by 23 per cent in 1979 over 1978. This increase was entirely due to a rise in prices by 33 per cent, because the quantity of rubber exports fell by 7 per cent. At the end of the year, rubber stocks awaiting shipment were fairly high. This could be due to the uncertainty in the market and inadequate shipping facilities.

Earnings from coconut exports (in rupee terms) too increased: sharply by 34 per, cent. As in the case of. rubber,. this increase was entirely due? to the worligj price increases of ooconut products in 1970: The volume of coconut kernel products-exports in 1979 dropped by 10 per cent. Of the total value of Rs. 1,699 million1

of cocoriut. exports, Rs. 1,298 million was earned by coconut kernel products an4 Rs. 401 million7by the other products.

.Export earnings of selected minor agricultural crops at Rs. 851 million in 1979 showed an increase of 15 per cent. The volume of exports of cinnamon, cloves and cardamoms increased significantly, while that of pepper, cocoa, papain and sesame seeds declined. The petroleum exports (including bunkering) at Rs. 1,926 million indicated an appreciable two-fold increase, as a result of a marginal increase in volume and a substantial rise in prices. Gem exports declined by 8 per cent in value terms, despite tax reliefs. The gross value of exports from the Industrial Processing Zone at Katunayake in 1979 was Rs. 115 million of which, garments alone accounted for Rs. 107 million. The overall value of textile and garment exports by Sri Lanka increased, as expected, from Rg. 481 million in 1978 to Rs. 1,108 million in 1979, or by 130 per cent.

Imports

As mentioned earlier, import expenditure rose by 54 per cent in rupee terms or by 45 per cent in SDR terms in 1979. The volume of imports was higher by 23 per cent, and the import prices, by 52 per cent. The rate of flow of imports

accelerated 1979.. In contrast to the pre-Jiberalization period, capital arid inter­mediate goods imports were prominent. "Out of total'imports,* capital goods imports rose from 23 per cent in 1978 to 24 per cent in I 9 7 9 - . " The intermediate goods too'increased from 38 per cent in 1978 to 41 per cent of the total in 1979-. The increasing levels of capital and intermediate goods imports indicated an improving investment climate. Of the total value of investment goods imports, 53 per cent consisted of machinery and equipment, 30 per cent transport equipment, and 7 per cent building materials. Latter imports rose nearly one and a half times. \ - ""' ' - . . •

Of the total value of imports, the expenditure on intermediate goods constituted little over 40 per cent, at Rs. 9,143 million, indicating ah increase, of 64 per cent over 1978. Nearly two-third of this increase was. the result of higher prices of petroleum (43 per cent) and fertilizer (7 per cent). ..... c .

The share of consumer goods, declined from 38 to 35 per cent. These imports increased by Rs. 2.206 million or by 39 per cent in 1979. Foods and drinks represented 61 per cent of such imports, while textile imports accounted for 20 per cent. The other consumer goods imports increased by 54 tier cent.

; Of the total value pf imports, rice, flour and sugar constituted 16 per cent in 1979, compared to 24 per cent in 1978. But the total expenditure on these three commodities taken together increased marginally. The value of sugar imports went up by 50 per cent, while that of flour imports declined by 23 per cent. The value of rice imports increased by Rs. 195 million or by 28 per cent, with a 13 per cent increase in quantity. There has been a 40 per cent increase in the volume of sugar imports in 1079.

Foreign Trade Policy ~- ; r .

Export promotion and further dismantling of trade controls and the continuous review of the tariffs were the main features of the trade policy in 1979. -The policies designed to promote exports included institutional support, fiscal incentives and development of export processing zones, as a special case.

The Sri Lanka Export Development Board was established in June^ comprising of representatives of the government and the private sector. The Board acting under the overall guidance, and directon of an Export, Development Council,of Ministers, where the President of Sri Lanka was the Chairman, was responsible for" the formulation, monitoring and- implementation of national export develop­ment policies and plans. Further, the Board will function as a focal point within • the goverjamefit where the exporters can deal-'with all' export problems in cloes cooperation with the various agenciesof the government, and of trade and industry. An Export Development Fund was established ifor export product development with fihancialj assistance! The other institution j ai-medj at export promotion has' been the Sri I^anka Export Credit Insurance Corporation-established in February, 1979 to assist'exporters to obtain pre and post shipment finance, and-guarantees on credit for execution'of export orders. With-the assistance of commercial banks, the Corporation provided insurance cover against-non-rreceipt or delayed-receipt of payments from abroad que to commercial and non-commercial risks.

The full cost, of plant; machinery and .fixtures and a half the cost of building construction were allowed to be deducted from the taxable income.of manufactures'. Tax holidays and exemptions, were 'also provided for .companiesengaged in export and other productive activities. The cost of advertising and-, travelling, outside. Sri Lanka in connection with export promotion were made deductible from taxable income. The export of- any manufactured or processed articles "was exempt from Business Turnover Tax. In addition, a duty drawback-scheme-was in operation, whereby the exporters.could obtain a rebate on the customs duty paid on imported raw materials and components at the point of export of processed goods.

Import duties underwent several modifications during the' year. Duties on some capital goods such as mammoties, floats for fishing nets and liquid trans­porters were removed while the duty on lorries and vans were reduced to 5 per cent., Import duties on many intermediate goods were also reduced,-as in the case of articles of iron and steel, batteries,- cement, sanitary ware, aluminium ware, radio parts, fluorescent lamps and television equipment. However, the duties on certain intermediate goods such as machine glazed; kraft paper and semi chemical fluting paper were increased. The duty on motor cycles and other cycles was removed and the duty on television sets was reduced from 5o to 12J per cent and gas cookers from 50 to 25 per cent. The duty on domestic refrigerators arid deep freezers was increased from 50 to 75 per cent while the duty on refrigerating equipment was reduced from 50 to 25 per cent. " . . " ' . ' - .

Some consumer items such as soap, matches, paper, books, certain textiles and glass chimneys were allowed to be imported at reduced rates. On the other hand, duties on certain kinds of fabrics, alcoholic beverages, sweetened condensed milk, rectified and other spirits were raised.

Export duties too were modified during 1979. The export duty on tea was reduced, but the Tea Board cess was increased. In regard to rubber, the Rubber Research cess was doubled. Export duties on agricultural export; crops, except for cinnamon were abolished.

Internal Trade Policy ^ S k *

Under the liberal. trade policy, price mechanism, was expected tQsjprwfme! the necessary incentives to producers, while free competition was. JjOTS&tea^Jo ensure fair prices to the consumers. Although there was no consaj^u^/sfOTt to negate these principles, certain state activities tended to limit^^C-fSri^renents of a liberal trade policy. ' ^ f k j j t / r ^

Legal provisions for price controls that prevailed earlier c^tmued to remain in the statute book, and were used only in respect of a few essential commodities such as sugar, flour, bread, dhall and infant milk foods. The Consumer Protection Law enacted during the year, while providing for some welcome measures such as promotion of associations of consumers and establishment of fair trade practices, also provided for prescribing of any articles and services for regulation by the National. Price Commission. At a time when encouragement of higher levels o f investment and greater competition was the declared, policy of the Government, such price regulatory measures appeared unwarranted.

The main -state trading organizations continued to operate, in competition with the private-sector. Yet, in the trading of certain items like textiles and dried fish which were subject to licensing, these organizations remained a favoured sector. It appeared that the principal role of these organizations was, to assist the government in its attempts to reduce the cost of living, particularly, of the low income groups, and also to stabilize prices of essential commodities.

Government's intentions of further liberalization of trade became apparent when the import of sugar was liberalized. However, no private commercial import of sugar could be expected, as the government declared its intention of stabilizing sugar prices during the year. Also, despite liberalization, sugar conti­nued to remain a commodity subject to price control, which probably deterred prospective private importers from entering the trade. Once the import of a commodity is liberalized, the need for price control of that commodity should not arise.

The Governments' concern for the consumer interests sometimes resulted in certain ad hoc decisions and short term measures being taken which would have discouraged domestic production in the long run. For instance, the import of chicken and its sale at very low prices by the state at one time disrupted market incentives and created much uncertainty in the local poultry industry. Such decisions could adversely affect long term investment.

As a means of stabilizing prices and ensuring regular supplies, "buffer stock schemes" were in operation for a number of commodities such as dried chillies, safety matches, milk foods, dried yeast, corriander, fish etc. Some of these schemes did not appear to have been well worked out. Stocking of dried yeast, for instance, resulted in unsold stocks being piled up in warehouses. In the case of dried chillies, there was no proper co-ordination between the two main organizations, the C.W.E. and the Marketing Department.

There is an urgent need for greater rationality to be brought into state trading policies. In keeping with the overall liberal policy framework, they ought to bring in greater competition and efficiency in the public sector trade, if that sector is to engage in trade in a big way at all. Adequate protection and incentives to local producers should be ensured through an appropriate long-term tariff policy. Frequent revisions of tariffs create uncertainties, and thereby act as constraints to long-term business decision making. Pricing of commodities by the state trading organizations should give more consideration to producer incentives. Buffer stock management would need to be more carefully worked out, both to avoid over stocking, and also not to over-supply the market, especially in the case of locally produced minor foods stuff like chillies; onions and potatoes.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 1

The balance of payments developments in 1979 were largely the outcome of the economic reforms since 1977. Imports were liberalized with a view to raising domestic productivity, and to achieve an export-led'economic growth in' the" long-term. As a result of the immediate increase in demand -for imports, arising from increased-domestic economic activity;:along with a sharp rise in import.prices, the
