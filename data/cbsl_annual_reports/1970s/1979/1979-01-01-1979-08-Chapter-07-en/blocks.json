    "text": "The trade liberalization of 1977 was expected to lead to a substantial immediate increse in imports, while the export response was expected to be slower due to supply rigidities, thereby worsening the trade deficit. This did not take place as anticipated, in 1978, probably on account of the slower reaction of impor\u00adters, who had to re-establish their trade connections. Belatedly in 1979, the origi\u00adnally anticipated, reaction took place, and the trade deficit recorded a near four-fold increase. Despite higher prices, demand for capital and intermediate goods accele\u00adrated, as the general economic climate improved considerably. By contrast, the volume of all major exports tea, rubber and coconut as well as most of the minor agricultural crops declined during the year, due to an uneven production performance arising from adverse weather and problems in management and marketing. With the declining prices of tea, the incentives given by the exchange reform in 1977 was maintained by way of export duty reductions in July, 1979.",

The average f.o.b. price per kilo of tea exported in 1979 was Rs. 30.51 (SDR 1.52), as against Rs. 33.22 (SDR 1.70) in 1978. The average price of tea sold at the Colombo auctions declined by 14 per cent in 1979 and the average price of Sri Lanka tea at London auctions declined by 9 per cent. In July, duties levied on tea exports were reduced by nearly one-third, while the Tea Board cess increased marginally. As mentioned earlier, the tea industry suffered badly from a liquidity-cum-profit squeeze due to deteriorating prices and heavy taxation. This major industry deserves urgent corrective measures if it is to lead the much desired export growth in a liberalized trade regime.",

The petroleum exports (including bunkering) at Rs. 1,926 million indicated an appreciable two-fold increase, as a result of a marginal increase in volume and a substantial rise in prices. Gem exports declined by 8 per cent in value terms, despite tax reliefs. The gross value of exports from the Industrial Processing Zone at Katunayake in 1979 was Rs. 115 million of which, garments alone accounted for Rs. 107 million.
