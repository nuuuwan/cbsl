In keeping with the overall liberal policy framework, they ought to bring in greater competition and efficiency in the public sector trade, if that sector is to engage in trade in a big way at all.

Frequent revisions of tariffs create uncertainties, and thereby act as constraints to long-term business decision making. Pricing of commodities by the state trading organizations should give more consideration to producer incentives.

As in 1978, the increase in import payments was mostly in respect of intermediate and investment goods. Importation of investment goods, such as machinery and equipment, transport equipment and building materials, increased considerably, to meet the domestic demand created by new investments. The increase in the import bill on intermediate goods was largely attributable to higher prices for petroleum imports and larger import volume of other intermediate goods. The demand for investment and intermediate goods imports is likely to gather momentum in the years ahead.

Payments on travel abroad increased marginally to Rs. 458 million (SDR 23 million) in 1979 as compared to a steep rise in the previous year. Increases in interest earnings on foreign investments and earnings from port services also contributed to the surplus in the services account. With the growth of external assets, interest earnings on the investment of such assets in foreign money markets nearly doubled from Rs. 314 million (SDR 16 million) in 1978 to Rs. 614 million (SDR 30 million) in 1979.

It could be estimated that approximately 70 per cent of these inward remittances were received from the Sri Lankans employed in the Middle Eastern countries. Official transfers, consisting largely of project and commodity grants from foreign governments and international organisations, more than doubled from Rs. 900 million (SDR 46 million) in 1978, to Rs. 2,239 million (SDR 1 1 1 million) in 1979.",

In SDR terms, total foreign payments (uses) rose by 28 per cent, whereas foreign earnings (sources) increased only by 18 per cent, resulting in a widening of the external resource gap from Rs. 4,048 million (SDR 230 million) in 1978 to Rs. 7,554 million (SDR 376 million) in 1979. As pointed out before, the high level of import payments was the major source of the widening resource gap. Capital repayments, which accounted for a large proportion of the total payments prior to 1977, declined further in 1979, reflecting some important changes in the modes of financing of the external resource gap in recent years.",

    "text": "Since 1977, outright grants, long-term official borrowings, private direct investments and the drawings from the IMF have become more important in financing of the resource gap than short-term credits and bank borrowings. Long-term loans consisted of commodity aid of Rs. 1,464 million (SDR 72 million), project aid of Rs. 840 million (SDR 42 million) and a loan of Rs. 599 million (SDR 30 million) from the Trust Fund of the IMF. Although the disbursements of long-term official loans have declined from Rs. 3,680 million (SDR 188 million) in 1978 to Rs. 2,903 million (SDR 144 million) in 1979, this decline was more than offset by the substantial increase in outright grants. Thus, the relative importance of outright grants in financing the external resource gap has increased considerably. These included commodity grants of Rs. 1,167 million (SDR 58 million), project grants of Rs. 998 million (SDR 49 million) and profits distributed by the IMF under it's gold sales programme of Rs. 74 million (SDR 4 million). Suppliers' credits which dipped sharply in 1978, rose substantially to Rs. 609 million (SDR 31 million) in 1979.",

The IMF provided Rs. 1,592 million (SDR 80 million) in two equal instalments in 1979 under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The EFF arrangement for Sri Lanka was approved in January, 1979 permitting Sri Lanka to borrow up to SDR 260.3 million (Rs. 5,206 million, approximately) during the three years from 1979 to 1981 for the purpose of providing medium-term balance of payments assistance needed to effect structural adjustments in the economy, subject to periodic negotiation and mutual agreement on Sri Lanka's overall economic policies. In addition, the IMF allocated SDR 12.4 million (Rs. 241 million) to Sri Lanka in January, 1979. This was the first SDR allocation made under a resolution adopted by the IMF in December, 1978 which provided for a total allocation of about SDR 4 billion to all the participants in the SDR Department of the IMF in each of the three years 1979, 1980 and 1981.",

    "text": "The changing pattern of the modes of financing of the external resource gap in recent years is partly responsible for the decline in the debt service ratio (i.e. capital repayments and interest on foreign loans including IMF transactions and bank borrowings, as a percentage of earnings from merchandise exports and services) from 15 per cent in 1978 to 13 per cent in 1979. Excluding IMF transactions, the debt service ratio fell from 12 per cent in 1978 to 8 per cent in 1979. The actual debt service payments declined by 16 per cent from Rs. 1,862 million (SDR 95 million) in 1978 to Rs. 1,620 million (SDR 80 million) in 1979, owing to the changes in the maturity structure of the debt contracted in the recent past. The easing in debt service burden is explained partly by the increase in earnings from exports and services in 1979 and partly by the more favourable terms on which recent borrowings have been made. For instance, about 70 per cent of the total number of long-term loans amounting to 74 per cent of the total value contracted in 1979, carried a grace period of 10 years or more. The outstanding level of external debt rose from Rs. 17,506 million (SDR 865 million) at the end of 1978 to Rs. 18,447 million (SDR 906 million) at the end of 1979, as a result of a higher utilization of project and commodity loans, and drawings from the IMF under the EFF and the Trust Fund.",

Provsional capital expendi-ure, including sinking fund contributions and repayments, amounted to Rs. 8,991 million, and with a current account surplus of Rs. 200 million, the overall budget deficit was Rs. 8,791 million. This was financed to a great extent from domestic resources amounting to Rs. 4,589 million, and a sum of Rs. 4,229 million obtained from foreign sources.
