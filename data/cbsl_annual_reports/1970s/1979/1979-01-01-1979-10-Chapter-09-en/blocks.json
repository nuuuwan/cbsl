    "text": "The changing pattern of the modes of financing of the external resource gap in recent years is partly responsible for the decline in the debt service ratio (i.e. capital repayments and interest on foreign loans including IMF transactions and bank borrowings, as a percentage of earnings from merchandise exports and services) from 15 per cent in 1978 to 13 per cent in 1979. Excluding IMF transactions, the debt service ratio fell from 12 per cent in 1978 to 8 per cent in 1979. The actual debt service payments declined by 16 per cent from Rs. 1,862 million (SDR 95 million) in 1978 to Rs. 1,620 million (SDR 80 million) in 1979, owing to the changes in the maturity structure of the debt contracted in the recent past. The easing in debt service burden is explained partly by the increase in earnings from exports and services in 1979 and partly by the more favourable terms on which recent borrowings have been made. For instance, about 70 per cent of the total number of long-term loans amounting to 74 per cent of the total value contracted in 1979, carried a grace period of 10 years or more. The outstanding level of external debt rose from Rs. 17,506 million (SDR 865 million) at the end of 1978 to Rs. 18,447 million (SDR 906 million) at the end of 1979, as a result of a higher utilization of project and commodity loans, and drawings from the IMF under the EFF and the Trust Fund.",

This trade related tax revenue also accounted for 55 per cent of total revenue, revealing a substantial dependence of the budget on foreign trade. Thus, domestic fiscal operations can be greatly affected by adverse price fluctuations in the international markets, which can impose serious constraints on the budgetary programme, as was evident in the latter half of 1979, when export duties on tea had to be reduced to relieve the industry. Further, growing importance of indirect taxes as a proportion of total revenue also has its bearing on the subject of tax incidence. Though benefits of public expenditure have also to be taken into account when issues of tax incidence are discussed, there is no ambiguity that all indirect taxes, in one form or the other, have a built-in-element of regressivity, especially in a context where there is skewed distribution of income. Therefore, if the indirect tax rates are determined with reference to the tax incidence on different income groups, the element of regressivity can be mitigated to a very great extent.",

Ever since, they have come under severe criticism, as pre-empting parliamentary control of public finance. Theoretically, any govern\u00adment activity which can be reasonably forecast, could be incorporated in the Budget. The Public Corporation form could be adopted, if some financial flexibility has to be provided for state activity. Hence, now that these accounts have come to assume such significance, it may be appropriate to assess whether these accounts should be continued at all in the future.",

    "text": "The healthy containment of monetary expansion within a manageable limit of 11 per cent in 1978 was negatived in 1979, when money supply grew by 29 per cent. This was largely the result of growth in external banking assets (net) and in credit to government. In continuation of the trends observed since the 1977 interest rate reforms, there was continued acceleration of deposit mobilization by commercial banks; time and savings deposits alone rising by Rs. 2,483 million, as compared with a rise of Rs. 1,572 million in 1978. Despite relatively high interest rates, demand for credit remained high. Commercial bank branch expansion accelerated in 1979, although the reorganization of the Agricultural Service Centre branches of the Bank of Ceylon would have led to a decline in the spread of banking activity; and three new foreign banks opened in Colombo.",
