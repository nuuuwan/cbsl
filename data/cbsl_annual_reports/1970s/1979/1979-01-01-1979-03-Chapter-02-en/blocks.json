Of the tree crops, coconut produc\u00adtion recovered from its all-time low level of 1977. Rubber production declined by about 2 per cent, despite a remarkable improvement in prices. Tea production increased marginally, despite deteriorating prices since 1978. Minor export crops fared unevenly, the exports of cinnamon, cloves, coffee and cardamom rising and exports of cocoa, pepper and papain declining. Of the annual crops, paddy production has been estimated to have increased marginally, while the production of other food crops such as onions, chillies and indigenous cereals appears to have been depressed at or below the low levels of the previous year. Cane sugar production which rose by 11 per cent in 1978 dropped sharply by 26 per cent in 1979. Fish production which has been estimated to have risen by 12 per cent in 1978, appears to have grown slower by 9 per cent in 1979. Although the National Milk Board's collections rose by 27 per cent, government estimates of milk production in 1979 indicated a decrease of 7 per cent. Egg production has been estimated to have risen by 20 per cent.",

Undoubtedly, there were exceptional factors in 1979 such as the failure of the South-West monsoonal rains and the disastrous cyclone of late 1978. But the uneven performance of this sector was also due to many avoidable factors, such as management problems in the state-owned plantations, consumer-oriented pricing and subsidy policies which inhibited production and heavy and inflexible taxation of export crops. These problems have been repeatedly spotlighted in recent Annual Reports.",

Thus, virtually all tenant farmers have been called upon to pay a higher share of crop *o the landlords. Ostensibly, the aim of this provision was to make farmers cultivate land more efficiently, but the questionwhether this would affect farmer incentives would have to be carefully examined.",

The official participation in the Agrarian Service Committees was made more pronounced by specifying that 8 out of 14 members should be officials. However, in the previous Cultivation Commi\u00adttee membership, the farmer representation was more pronounced by the requirement that not less than 10 persons in the committee be direct representatives of farmers. Whether official majorities in the new committees will make them function better is a highly debatable issue. Hence, it would be worthwhile to review the current arrangements after about a year's experience and a thoroughgoing review.",

A committee which reveiwed the tax strecture cautioned the government on the serious long-term decline of the industry, on account of high export taxation, which was primarily engineered to keep domestic prices low. which gave a low return to coconut cultivation. It recommended raising of the producer price at least to one rupee per nut on the average during 1979 and thereafter, to raise at least by the tise in the general cost of living; and government intervention to assure the producer of this price, by powering of export taxation, permitting more liberal exports during the glut season from May to September, stockpiling of coconut oil to stabilize prices, and rationalization of the institutional framework. Government accepted the proposals, but when coconut prices moved up during the latter part of 1970, partly as a result of lowering of export duties and partly due to seasonal factors, the authorities reacted with attempts to bring down coconut prices by diverting coconuts from state owned lands to urban areas for consumption. The apparent contradiction in policies yet remains to be resolved.",

Agricultural credit granted in 1979 was 40 per cent lower than the average volume of credit given in any year since 1973. The immediate and apparent cause for this was primarily the removal of the 75 per cent credit guarantee operated by the Central Bank on behalf of the Government in 1978. The decision to withdraw the guarantee was greatly influenced by high rate of defaults that undermined the operations of the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (CRCS) in the past, particularly during the Maha season 1977/78, when credit was liberalized. It was al?o quite apparent that the existence of the guarantee acted as a disincentive for the eommercial banks to tighten up their lending and recovery procedures. With the removal of the guarantee, there was a marked change in attitude of the commercial banks towards rural credit. The banks become more strict and demanding in their requirements in granting agricultural loans.",

Total fertilizer issues to the agricultural sector declined by about 2 per cent. This should be treated as a warning, that even in 1980, a major production increase in agriculture would be difficult to achieve, unless efforts were made urgently to raise input use, including fertilizer. The response to replanting schemes in 1979 was better, both in tea and rubber. State plantations stepped up their replanting programmes, despite negative profit margins. In the case of rubber, however, it was the private sector that took the lead in responding to the replanting schemes, probably on account of increases in subsidies and the rising prices of rubber wood for fuel. Coconut replanting too increased considerably in 1979. ' \u2022 .",

    "text": "However, considering the level of replanting needed in the tree crop sector, for timely-replacement of senile plants and to catch up on the backlog of recent years, the. performance in 1979 cannot be deemed as adequate at all. None of the conservatively determined annual targets were achieved. Hence, as repeatedly urged in previous Annual Reports, there is an urgent need for a substantial raising of replanting subsidies in the tree crop sector. Recent increases in subsidies have been small, and very soon, cost increases had vitiated the impact of the uv-creases in subsidies. Moreover, except perhaps in the case of minor exports, none of the replanting subsidies seemed to take account of the loss of income which the grower has to bear for 4 to 6 years, after uprooting his plants until the new plants commence yielding a product. Increasing subsidies should not cause problems, because funds for replanting are generated by a cess on exports. Moreover, the procedures that have to be followed in releasing these subsidies were cumbresome and could easily be simplified. - ...",

    "text": "The expansion in the production of certain key minor export crops during 1979 was probably due to the complete or partial removal of export duties, which yielded better prices to producers. The increase in production, implied by export volumes, was particularly evident in case of cloves, coffee, nutmeg/mace and cardamom. This evidently demonstrates that small producers do respond positively to price incentives, even in the case of perennial crops, a fact which is often ignored in policy making. New planting and replanting subsidies for minor export crops, which have remained unchanged since 1972, have now been raised subs\u00adtantially, not only taking into account cost escalations, but also, the loss of producer incomes during the long gestation period.",

In the Ulhitiya Oya project, dam construction itself has been started, while preliminary work has commenced in the case of Maduru Oya and Kotmale projects. In the Victoria project, feasibility studies and preparatory work have been largely completed. In the Randenigala project, feasibility studies are still going on, while in the case of Moragahakanda project, a decision has yet to be taken with regard to its future. In the Bowatenna project, which is not in the Accelerated Programme, and which does not seem to have received the priority it deserves, slow progress has been made in the construction of the power house, with regard to the system development for cultivation purposes, about 12,000 hectares of new land were developed by the end of 1979 in the Kalawewa region (known as System 'H') and about 13,300 families were settled, each with an allocation of about one hectare (2\u00a7 acres) for cultivation purposes and i/5th hectare (half acre) for home-gardening and housing.",

    "text": "The apparent neglect of minor irrigation schemes, which has been observed for some years now, appears to have continued in 1979. Apart from the pre\u00adoccupation with larger projects, the major factor responsible for this unhealthy development appears to be the division of responsibility for construction, supervision, maintenance and actual implementation among three separate governmental agencies. The responsibility of designing and constructing minor irrigation schemes is given to the Irrigation Department, while theresponsibility of supervision maintenance and repair is considered the work of Ministry of Agricultural Develop\u00adment and Research. Howeye^jufficient funds do not appear to have been allo\u00adcated to any of these agencies, either for designing and construction or for main\u00adtenance of minor irrigation schemes. Some funds (Rs. 350 million in 1979) have been assigned to the decentralised budget, which are disbursed at district/electorate levels; but these funds have been spent largely on schools, roads and buildings, and_only a fraction has found its way to irrigation. Clearly, one of the quickest and cheapest ways of achieving a short-term increase in agricultural output is to rapidly restore and keep these minor irrigation works in good condition, and there\u00adfore, this sector deserves much greater priority. The larger projects which will yield results after several years, could pre-empt resources available for minor works. The grant of adequate resources for minor irrigation works on a continuing Basis, would prevent this.",

However, as their factories also purchase tea leaf from private small\u00adholders, their actual direct share in production would have been slightly lower.",

    "text": "Fertilizer issues to the tea sector during the year declined by about 9 per cent, in contrast to a very sharp increase of about 44 per cent recorded last year. The JEDB and the SLSPC have increased their fertilizer application marginally, and hence the drop in fertilizer application would have taken place in privately owned lands. As this occurred despite an increase of tea fertilizer subsidy, it appears that the lower fertilizer use was the result of the substantial decline in tea prices during 1979. Weather conditions too were not encouraging, especially in low-grown areas, and fertilizer distributional problems too may have retarded usage; Neverthe\u00adless, the average yield per acre showed an increase of about 4 per cent, as against a decline of about 7 per cent in the previous year. This may have beenmainly due to the adoption of better agricultural practices and the lagged effect of higher fertilizer use in 1978.",

The subsidy for planting vegetatively propagated tea on old rubber lands has been increased from Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 4,750 per acre, and for planting on new lands, from Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 4,750 per acre. The rate of replanting in 1979 showed considerable improvement over the very poor performance of last year. But, the area replanted still lagged far behind the annual targets. The total area replanted under high yielding clonal varieties up to last year was 33,037 hectares (81,601 acres), a mere 14 per cent of the total area. Clearly, incentives for tea replanting has been grossly inadequate.",

    "text": "Tea prices declined in 1979. The average net (of taxes) Colombo auction price declined by 4 per cent. Ihe London auction prices of Sri Lanka teas dropped by 9 per cent. The average export (f.o.b.) prices fell by 8 per cent. Mean\u00adwhile, average ex-estate cost of production has been estimated to have risen by 21 per cent. Government-induced wage increases alone had raised the cost by 12 per cent. These developments resulted in a liquidity squeeze in the state owned plantations; however they were able to continue with their development programmes uninterrupted by borrowing from commercial banks. The private producers evidently deferred the adoption of recommended cultural practices and new investment. As a result, production during the early part of the year was running well below previous year's depressed levels, when the government was compelled to make a downward revision of taxes in July. Although production picked up thereafter, these adjustments did not appear to be adequate to relieve the industry, and further concessions had to be made through budget proposals announced in November. However, the problems of the tea industry remained unresolved, as the industry continued to be taxed 48 cents for every one rupee of tea exported (reckoning the export duty and the ad-valorem tax alone), thereby qualifying as, perhaps, one of the highest taxed economic activities in Sri Lanka, while continuing to be its mainstay. Clearly, current production ccsts and taxation are at such a level that the industry appears to be unable to generate an adequate surplus.",

This may be due to greater availability of village labour following wage increases, discernible slowing down of repatriation, and the movement of some surplus labour to deficit areas. But, this may be a passing phenomenon. It is time that studies are made to increase productivity of labour by simple mechanization so that future labour shortages and rising wage costs would not impair Sri Lanka's competitiveness in world markets. Current research, which is concentrated primarily on cultivation aspects, may have to be broadened to cover all aspects of the industry, ranging from- cultivation, plucking and proce\u00adssing, to packaging and exporting, more comprehensively.",

By improved management practices, and through more effective decentralization of management, and by elimination of outside interference in operations it should be possible for these corporations not only to increase production, but also to eliminate waste and losses and increase profitability. There were frequent reports of highly organized pilfering of made tea from estates, which were finally exported, without payment of internal taxes. The general view of those in the trade was that these thefts could be as high as 10 to 15 per cent of national production. Unless immediate corrective measures are taken, the situation is likely to get out of control.",

Hence, the formation of producer societies of small\u00adholders, for whom Tea Small-Holdings Development Authority (TSHDA) is having a scheme of assistance, appears desirable. The TSHDA's role could be further expanded to provide better extension, fertilizer distribution and planting materials. At present, its activities are hampered by the absence of a regular source of funds. The present practice of making funds available by the Tea Board/ at its discretion at irregular intervals creates uncertainties and prevents the adoption-' of a planned programme of work. Hence, a certain percentage of the teaiCes'Sp collection, according to the total share in production of the small-holder^f*fnay^ be assured to the TSHDA on a regular basis to facilitate the smooth jo^^^itm^. of a planned programme of work. y $ v ^",

It appears that fairly stringent conditions for obtaining subsidies have discouraged growers while some have not been able to obtain the finance to undertake the preliminary work. A change in the attitude of the authorities from one of control to one of positive promotion of the industry would be necessary.",

It is also disquieting that production in 1980 would, in all probability, be lower than in 1979, as more and more senile trees go out of production. Thus the key to the future of the rubber industry lies in increasing the rate of replanting and concurrently developing new clones which will produce much higher yields in shorter periods.

    "text": "As in the previous year, the increase in production in 1979 could be mainly attributed to favourable weather conditions and an increase in fertilizer use. Fertilizer application increased by about 20 per cent in 1979, as compared with an increase of 46 per cent last year. It should be noted, however, that current levels of fertilizer application are considerably below the recommended optimum. This could be partly due to the fact that the island was in the grips of a drought during a significant part of the year. The fertilizer use was very pronounced during the last quarter of the year, coinciding with rain in the main coconut growing areas. The increase in the fertilizer subsidy, particularly for Urea, from September insulated the producers from rising world prices. The producers were further assisted by a special credit scheme for coconut fertilizer which came into effect in April, which gave credit at a low interest rate (9 per cent), with repayment over 5 years, inclusive of a grace period of 2 years. Loans were available to lessees of lands as well.",

A limited export market and the official discouragement of exports during the lean season, may have been the main reasons for this decline.

High prices in the world market, a steadily expanding domestic market and the removal of restrictions on coconut oil exports (which was subsequently reintroduced in November) were the main causes.

The functioning of the coconut industry has been characterized by a multitude of controls and regulations, which have been designed to afford protection to the consumer, at the expense of the producer. During the lean season in 1979 (November to April) when the price of coconut rose seasonally, authorities intervened with a series of controls, ranging from making it compulsory for state-owned estates to sell coconuts to government procuring agencies, distribution of these coconuts in urban areas at lower prices and tightening up on the export of kernel products. The main reason given for the implementation of this strategy was that certain unscrupulous traders were taking advantage of the lean season to hold the consumers to ransom. However, it also resulted in the producer losing out on a chance to benefit from the seasonal improvement in prices.",

Taking into account the rapidly rising cost of living, coupled with rising costs of inputs, it will be necessary at least to protect producer margins, if not increase them. The long-term development of the industry is dependent to a great extent on the successful rationalisation of the producer interest against that of the consumer. Coconut and coconut products constitute about 2 2 per cent of nutrition of the average Sri Lankan's diet, and thus, any increase in the price of coconut would have a substantial impact on the cost of living. On the other hand, restrictive pricing policies will also ensure that coconut will remain a stagnant and declining industry. The development of the industry is also dependent on the investment that goes into processing. Thus, it is imperative that a remunerative price structure is is worked out to the benefit of the producer. Developments in 1979 seem to indicate that policies were cautiously and slowly geared to achieve this aim.",

    "text": "Paddy production in 1979 has been estimated at 1.9 million metric tons (91.9 million bushels of paddy or 1.3 million metric tons of rice) by the Department of Census and Statistics. This represented a marginal increase over the record crop of 1978. The. major Maha season of 1979 yielded an all-time record crop of 1.4 million metric tons C66.8 million bushels), which was 8 per cent higher than the previous season's crop. But the minor Yala season was affected by inclement weather and the crop declined by 13 percent to 0.5 million metric tons (25.1 million bushels). The record Maha crop, despite a sharp drop in fertilizer use and credit, could be attributed to favourable weather and better prices. The South-West Monsoon rains were poor and the Yala crop was severely affected. It would appear that, an.overall decline in annual production was averted by a considerably improved performance of paddy grown under the major irrigation schemes, a point which underscores the significance of irrigation and water management in further development.",

This decline was most pronounced during Maha, when it dropped by 44 per cent. Most probably, the high fertilizer prices that prevailed until September, 1979 depressed the demand for fertilizer. Also, cultivation loans declined very sharply from Rs. 448 million in 1978 to Rs. 74 million in 19^9, following the tightening of credit after the ill-advised credit liberalization during Maha 1977/78.",

    "text": "The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) purchased 29 per cent of the 1979 production, indicating a decline of 20 per cent from the previous year, when it was successful in purchasing 36 per cent of the crop. A decreasing trend in purchases was evident from the middle of 1979, resulting from the lower Yala crop and increased competition from the private sector. The PMB should not be overly concerned if its purchases drop owing to competition from the private sector, because that would mean that farmers obtained better prices. This was the primary purpose of establishing the PMB, although the current law assigns to it a role designed to completely control the paddy market. This law has been enacted during a regime of controls, and has now become irrelevant. When faced with declining purchases, the PMB may use its extensive powers, because it may believe that it was its duty to buy as much paddy as it could, under any circumstances. Hence, it may be advisable to amend the law suitably. The curtailment of the powers of the PMB would also help to remove current uncertainties in the private sector milling industry.",

    "text": "On ist September, 1979 the Government introduced the Food Stamp Scheme, replacing the state sponsored rationing and distribution scheme which existed in the country for nearly four decades. Under the new scheme, the eligible house\u00adholds received \"Food Stamps\" according to entitled values, which could be utilised to purchase specified goods viz. rice, paddy, flour, bread, sugar, selected milk foods and dried fish. The administered prices of these goods, which were hitherto influenced by government policy, were thereafter expected to reflect true market conditions, and the object of the food stamps was to initially compensate the truly indigent families for the resulting higher cost of basic food items. Unlike in the case of the former ration scheme, the eligible households were not tied to a predetermined weekly supply of rice and/or paddy and other goods at predetermined prices. Thus, the government was able to extricate itself from the dual stranglehold of guaranteed supplies of food under rationing and of price subsidization, irrespective of the income or wealth of beneficiaries. It was thus able to direct food income subsidization to the most needy groups, with a fairly definite financial commitment.",

    "text": "Accordingly, the monthly rice supply commitment of the Food Commissioner (FC) has been greatly reduced from an average issue of about 52,000 mt. tons during the pre Food Stamp Scheme period to about 33,500 mt. tons per month after September, 1979. On the other hand, private sector suppliers have expanded their operations to meet the increased demand for rice in the open market. In this new situation, the role of the PMB and the FC has changed dramatically from mere purchasing-cum-distributing agencies to that of market regulation, the PMB holding the market 'floor' for farmers' \u2022 paddy and the FC holding the market 'ceiling' for consumers' rice (and substitute wheat flour) by importing the shortfall in supplies. It appears that these two functions, in the new context, are best performed by one organization. As much as the PMB should not measure its achievements by the proportion of the annual harvest it purchases from the farmers, but by its ability to stabilize the paddy/rice market to the farmers, the FC should not feel obliged to standby to exchange food stamps for food items at predetermined prices, but to stabilize the consumer market by efficient supply management at the wholesale level. There were signs during the year that these two institutions were moving towards a clearer definition of their respective roles in the newly emerging context.",

However, the average price of a bushel equivalent of paddy of imported rice has increased from Rs. 54 in 1978 to Rs. 61 in 1979. On the other hand, the producer margins in paddy cultivation have continued to decline in 1979, owing to increasing cost of production. The conditionalities for obtaining credit for paddy growing too were tightened. The farmer was also faced with the increasing cost of riving. The erosion of producer margins will reduce the resources available with the farmer for reinvestment and for improving his standard of living. Hence, an improvement in farmers real incomes may be necessary in order to sustain production incentives in this vital sector.",

The Fisheries Corporation gave up its own uneconomic production and sensibly concentrated on purchase and sale. Nevertheless, largely on account of higher open market prices, its purchases dropped by 30 per cent. On the other hand, dried fish imports were 6,828 Mt. tons in 1979, while other fish imports were 12 mt. tons , involving an import outlay of Rs. 19 million.

    "text": "The main problems associated with rural credit schemes in the past were two fold. First, the loans were disbursed as if they were government largesse; the need to repay such loans was seldom inculcated. Lack of adequate staff prevented the banks from closely supervising credit use. Secondly, much of the credit was channelled to small farmers operating at subsistence level. Often, they were unable to repay the loans due to the absence of a marketable surplus. For any rural credit scheme to succeed, solutions to these basic problems must be found. Institutional credit resources should be used to raise agricultural productivity. This is virtually impossible on small scale farms. Hence, an agrarian reform of consolidation of uneconomic small holdings may have to precede a viable rural credit scheme. Bank credit could be made available to continuous tracts operated by farmer groups organized on the basis of service co-operatives. These have to be closely supervised by banks. As these supervised loans involve additional work for bank staff, there should be compensatory incentives to offset this disadvantage. The banks and their branches may be requested to allocate a part of their resources for lending in this manner to the rural sector. Also, the banks which have thinly spread their limited trained staff on account of ambitious branch expansion programmes in recent times, should seriously consider expanding their training programmes, especially in lending to rural agriculture. The commence\u00adment of internationally supported \"Integrated District Development Programmes\" in several districts should provide a vital opportunity for banks to get into rural banking, with \"greater confidence. If the banks could initiate meaningful action in these aspects, there would be a strong case for the re-introduction of the credit guarantee, perhaps at a more moderate level. For its part, the Central Bank has reorganized its former Development Finance Department as a new Department of Rural Credit and Development Finance, with a view to initiating new responses in the field of rural credit.",
