As some of this migration would cause shortages of domestically available skills^ the educationaL authorities will have to undertake a major training programme at the school level. Also, experience of other countries in similar circumstances have shown that the later return of this migratory labour creates considerable socio-economic problems. Resettlement of these workers in productive domestic employment in the near future should, therefore, deserve early attention.",
