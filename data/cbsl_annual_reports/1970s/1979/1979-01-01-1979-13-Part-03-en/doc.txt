Circular No< 379 Central Bank of Ceylon, P. O. Box 590, Colombo 1. and May, 1979.

Guidelines For The Provision of Bank Finance For GCEC Enterprises

Any commercial bank in Sri Lanka may provide- banking facilities, in accordance with the guidelines given below, to enterprises with which the Greater Colombo Economic Commission has entered into agreement,.under Section 17 of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission Law (GCEC enterprises). It is not necessary for a commercial bank to have, a branch located in an Investment Promotion Zone for providing such banking facilities.

Guidelines

1. In providing rupee finance to GCEC enterprises, banks should bear in mind the stipulation contained in regulation 7 (d) dated 25th October 1978 which reads as follows:—

"Every agreement entered into with an enterprise under Section 17 of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission Law No... 4 of 1978 shall specifiy that all working capital of the enterprise shall be met by convertible foreign currency remittances to Sri Lanka save as otherwise exempted by the Commission in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and Planning".

2. Loans and advances which may be granted by a commercial' bank to GCEC enterprises should not exceed, in the aggregate two per centum of its total loans and advances, as at 31st December 1978. However, this limit may be exceeded by an amount which is not in excess of twenty per centum of the increase of deposits of the commercial bank over the level of its deposits as at 31st December 1978. . - t •

3. A bank should maintain separate books of accounts in respect of all its transactions with GCEC enterprises;

4. As it is generally expected that GCEC enterprises should use foreign resources for funding themselves, the extension of rupee finance by banks should be minimal. Accordingly \ Central Bank accommodation may be available to banks in respect of loans and advances granted by banks to GCEC enterprises on a case-by-case basis provided such loans and advances have been granted within the terms of (2) above. Lijnited swap arrangements will be considered also on a case-by-case basis.
