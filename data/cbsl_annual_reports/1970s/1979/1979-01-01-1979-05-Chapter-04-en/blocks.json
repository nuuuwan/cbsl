The Colombo Consumers' Price Index increased by 1 per cent each in the first two quarters. In the third and fourth quarters, it increased by 4 and 8 per cent, respectively, depicting an accelerated rate of increase in the price level towards the latter half of the year. The Wholesale Price Index, on the other hand, declined by 5 per cent in the first half of 1979 and rose sharply by 23 per cent from the midyear level.",

These included the increased supply of imported goods under the liberalized trade policy, greater competition in the import and distribution trade, and improvement in transport facilities due to a substantial increase in the stock of commercial vehicles.",

    "text": "On the whole, it would appear that the inflation in the economy accelerated during 1979, belying the expectations of the previous year, when there were signs of moderation. Best available data suggest a general price rise in the region of 20 per cent in 1979, which compares with about 15 per cent last year. Sharp acceleration in money growth and the unexpectedly large budget deficit were having its full effects towards the latter part of the year. However, the redeeming feature on the price front was the fact that at least a half of the increase in price indices was on account of changes induced in government-administered prices, the cost of living impact of which has been moderated by wage increases and increased welfare payments under the Food Stamp Scheme.",

The rationing of essential food items, which had existed for nearly four decades, was almost done away with during 1979, while no new additions were made to the list of items under price controls. As a compensatory measure to offset the burden of higher prices of food items, consequent on the abolition of the rationing system, the government introduced an income support programme - the Food Stamp Scheme - details of which were given earlier. In 1979, the controlled prices of wheat flour, bread, dhal (lentils) and some milk and infant foods were revised upwards.",

Mean\u00adwhile, the National Prices Commission continued to review prices of goods that were referred to it, and made recommendations.
