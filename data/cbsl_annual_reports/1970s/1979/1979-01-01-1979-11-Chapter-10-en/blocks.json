    "text": "As in the previous year, some element of seasonality was observed during 1979 in the pattern of monetary growth. Generally, commercial bank credit to co-operative institutions rise during the first half of each year and tend to decline sharply thereafter, especially during the fourth quarter of each year. Conforming to this pattern, bank credit to co-operative institutions declined sharply during the fourth quarter of 1979. The movements in external banking assets which do not normally display a seasonal pattern, were expansionary on the money supply throughout 1979, except during the first quarter. The financial operations of government corporations were expansionary during the first and fourth quarters of the year and contractionary during the second and third quarters. The operations of the 'other private sector' were expansionary throughout, more prominently during the second half of 1979. As in the case of the operations of the semi-govern\u00adment sector, the government sector's operations with the banking system resulted in an expansionary impact during the first and fourth quarters and a contractionary impact during the rest of the year, infusing a further element of seasonality into the pattern of monetary growth in 1979. Although the behaviour of some sub-sectors within the private sector and the movements in net external banking assets were devoid of a clear seasonal character, the monetary developments in 1979 seem to suggest the re-emergence of some element of seasonality into the pattern of monetary growth.",

Since August, 1979 the money supply continued to rise, which in the case of the previous year, occurred only from September onwards. A contrasting experience however was seen in December when the money supply registered a sharp increase, as against the marginal decline in the same month of the previous year. The growth of money supply in 1979 was largely due to the increase in the net external banking assets, the behaviour of which, as mentioned previously, was devoid of any seasonal character. Thus, the emerging seasonality in money growth was largely influenced by the operations of the government sector.",

This was the combined outcome of a higher level of borrowings amounting to Rs. 1,124 million during the first half of the year, offset marginally by a reduction of Rs. 140 million during the second half. These heavy borrowings were sometimes due to higher level of activity, especially for higher levels of imports, but there was also evidence of excessive resort to credit on account of inappropriate pricing policies, lack of financial discipline, and failure to exercise a reasonable degree of inventory control. On the other hand, some commercial banks appeared to show an extra-ordinary preference to financing of public corporations irrespective of their financial position. However, on account of a rise in time and savings deposits of this sector by Rs. 951 million, the expansionary impact of this sector's operations was contained at Rs. 33 million. The deposit growth of this magnitude was largely made possible by substantial deposits made by the National Develop\u00adment Bank with the banking system.",

Meanwhile, advances for cultivation and marketing purposes also dropped by Rs. 75 million and Rs. 17 million, respectively. However, credit for 'other' purposes showed a marginal increase of Rs. 40 million, leading to an overall reduction in credit to this sector. The sharp drop in credit to co-operative institutions in 1979 meant that the credit availability to the rural agricultural sector suffered a considerable set-back in 1979.",

This was the combined outcome of a considerable increase in bank credit to the government and a decrease in government deposits with the banking system.

However, the monetary expansion arising from these transactions was reduced to Rs. 477 million, by an increase in Central Bank's other assets and liabilities (net) of Rs. 580 million during the year.

The increase in total resources during the year was Rs. 4,817 million or 35 per cent, which was of the same magnitude as in the previous year. Changes in all major categories of liabilities contributed to enlarge the resource base of commercial banks. However, following the pattern observed in recent years, the growth in deposits provided the main impetus to the resource build-up , accounting for 72 per cent of the total increase in resources during the year. Both demand, and time and savings deposits registered large increases, but the growth in time and savings deposits amounting to Rs. 2,483 million accounted for the overwhelmingly larger share. As in the lastyear, this reflected the impact of the interest rate reform of 1977. Resource accumulation through increased deposits was further augmented by increases in paid-up capital, reserve funds and undistributed profits, foreign borrowings and in other liabilities. However, domestic inter-bank borrowings dropped by Rs. 552 million during the year.",

Also, commercial banks' borrowings from the Central Bank at Bank rate and at penal rates, which stood at Rs. 255 million at the end of 1978, declined to Rs. 195 million at the end of 1979. On the other hand, the ratio of liquid assets to total deposits dropped from 37 per cent in 1978 to 34 per cent in 1979.

Altogether, the total number of branches of commercial banks rose by 73 in 1979, as compared with an increase of 22 in the previous year. This was made up of 44 new branches opened by the Bank of Ceylon, 25 by the People's Bank, 1 branch by the Hatton National Bank and 3 new foreign banks which commenced operations during the year. But, for security and economic reasons, the Bank of Ceylon \"relocated\" 240 of its 390 Agricultural Service Centre (ASC) branches, which almost amounted to a down-grading of these branches to that of an extension office of a nearby full fledged branch. Even the earlier ASC branches provided a minimal service, but on account of the recent change, it is doubtful whether they could now be treated as bank branches at all. If this factor is taken into account, the number of bank branches should be deemed to have declined in 1979.",

In fulfilling the objective, of the Government to attract more foreign investments, it became necessary to allow the foreign banks of good repute to open branches in the country. Accordingly, three new foreign banks, viz. the Banque De LTndochine Et De Suez (Indosuez Bank), the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd. and the Citibank N. A. opened branches in Sri Lanka during 1979, bringing the total number of commercial banks operating in the country to 14.",

These banking units were permitted to deal only in foreign currency and with non-residents, approved residents and GCEC enter\u00adprises only. It was anticipated that this would be a forerunner of the development of an off-shore banking centre in Sri Lanka. As at the end of the year, 11 commercial banks were given approval by the Central Bank to operate as foreign currency banking units. Initially, they were permitted to transact in the US dollar and the Pound Sterling; but later, this was extended to cover 8 major international currencies. These units were permitted to accept deposits from, and grant loans to non-residents and GCEC enterprises, in foreign currency. As at the end of 1979, the total assets and liabilities of these units stood at US$ 39 million (Rs. 602 million).",

Analyzed in the context of fairly heavy borrowing by banks, especially the major banks at high penal rates, this would indicate a relatively high insensitivity of major banks to current interest costs. The lending rates of the National Housing Department remained unchanged during the year, while those of the Development Finance Corporation recorded an increase of 1 percentage point in September. The maximum lending rate of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank moved up by 4 per cent from September, 1979. The National Development Bank, which commenced business on 1st October, charged 10-12 per cent on itsrefinance loans, in keeping with government policy. The refinance loans from the Medium and Long-term Credit Fund of the Central Bank were re-classified into three broad categories and, effective from 1st August, 1979 the interest rates were revised. Upto this date, 6J percent was charged on loans for the development of agriculture and industry, while a rate of 7\u00a7 per cent was charged on loans for the development of trade, commerce or business. After the revision, the refinance loans for agriculture and fisheries approved by ministries were made at 6 | per cent, for approved investments carrying tax holidays and for agriculture and fisheries outside those approved by ministries at 9 per cent, and other production loans at 11 per cent.",

    "text": "The second half of 1979 witnessed increased pressure in the monetary scene, which necessitated the adoption of measures to moderate the anticipated growth in money supply. The policy stance was directed at rationalizing the existing policy and introducing marginal changes, where necessary, with a view to improving their effectiveness. It was also considered prudent to regulate on the basis of costs, rather than fall back on quantitative restrictions. Accordingly, further restrictions were made on Central Bank accommodation to commercial banks, with a view to limiting the credit creating capacity of the latter. Experience showed that the penal rate of 15 per cent did not serve as a sufficient deterrent to discourage commercial banks from resorting to heavy borrowings from the Central Bank. Hence, it was decided to rationalize the availability of Central Bank credit, by enchancing the level of accommodation available at Bank rate to facilitate easy management of short-term liquidity problems, whilst at the same time, discouraging recourse to Central Bank credit in excess of such enhanced amounts, by subjecting such credit to a graduated scale of penal rates. With effect from 4th September, 1979, the volume of accommodation available at Bank rate was raised from Rs. 402 million to Rs. 613 million, consisting of Rs. 403 million general accommo\u00addation, which was 4 per cent of selected assets of commercial banks, outstanding as at June 30, 1979; and Rs. 210 million export credit re-financing, distributed on the basis of outstanding export credit as at December 31, 1978. Any excess of borrowings above these limits were subject to a graduated scale of penal rates of 15 per cent on the first 10 per cent of eligibility, 16 per cent on the second 10 per cent of eligibility, 18 per cent on the third 10 per cent of eligibility, 20 per cent on the fourth 10 per cent of eligibility, 22 per cent on the fifth 10 per cent of eligi\u00adbility and thereafter, at 25 per cent per annum.",
