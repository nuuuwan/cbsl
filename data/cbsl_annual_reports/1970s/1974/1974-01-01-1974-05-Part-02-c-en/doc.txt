Introduction

The data on production and employment in the industrial sector for the year 1974 are based on a questionnaire addressed by the Central Bank, to manufacturing industries in the private and public sectors. An attempt was made to cover as many industrial units as possible. (The questionnaire carried the assurance that information furnished to the Central Bank would be treated as strictly confidential and that the data pertaining to individual establishments would not be disclosed).

A total of 3,513 questionnaires were issued. Of these only 1,827 returns were received with the information filled in, which represent a response rate of 51 per cent. Some 229 returns were returned undelivered in the post, and 217 were returned blank by the recipients informing that their industries were out of produc­tion.

In general, the year 1974 witnessed very little progress in industrial production in Sri Lanka. The shortage of foreign exchange, capital deficiency, limitations to the free play of market forces continue to inhibit industrial progress. In real terms industrial production increased only marginally, and that too is attributed to the greater coverage of the survey in 1974. The real value of production of those firms that reported both in 1973 and 1974, however, has shown a decline in 1974. The import content of industrial production remains very high, while the exports volume of industries still remains very low. For a small economy that has to depend heavily on imports, export orientation of local industry seems most essential. But heavy protection provided to local industries and the lack of competition from imports inhibit any tendency of these industries to reach the levels of quality and efficiency that are required for export orientation. The local market which is dominated by scarcities of manufactured goods has become the more profitable outlet for their products. As a long term strategy, therefore, it is imperative for Sri Lanka to provide the necessary conditions to make foreign markets more attractive to local industries.

The relavent statistical tables referred to below are given at the end of the text.

Production

Table 11(C) I gives the statistical summary of employment and the value of produc­tion at current prices for the period 1971—74, while Table II (C) 2 shows the value of industrial production by type of industry and the principal products for the same period, and Table l l ( C ) 2 (I) gives the value of industrial production at constant-prices.

In 1974 the value of production at current prices amounted to Rs. 4,093.9 million compared with Rs. 2,758.6 million in the previous year. The number of reporting firms too increased from 1,419 in 1973 to 1,497 in 1974. Little less than half the total of reporting firms belong to the category of textiles and leather industries, although their share of the total value of industrial production is about 15 per cent.

( 56 )

The considerable increase in the value of production at current prices in 1974 is largely a reflection of the inflationary tendencies experienced in the year. Much of the increase in the total value of production was due to an unprecedented increase in the value of petroleum products resulting from the oil price escalation that took place in 1974. The values of petroleum products increased by 151 per cent from 379 million in 1973 to 949 million in 1974 despite a fall in the volume of petroleum produc­tion by 15 per cent. In real terms the value of industrial production in 1974 increased by 2.2 per cent. However, when corrected for the increase in the number of report­ing firms the real value of industrial production is estimated to have declined by 5.2 per cent.

Table II (C) 2 (2) gives the value of industrial production both at current and constant prices in respect of corresponding reporting firms for 1973 and 1974. Here again the current values indicate an increase of 39.4 per cent in the total value of production in 1974 while in real terms it shows a decline.

Capacity Utilization

The utilized capacity as a percentage of the total available capacity in industry is shown in Table II (C) 2 (3). In 1974 about 60 per cent of the total capacity in the industrial sector remained unutilized. The very high unutilized capacity may have been partly due to the shortage of raw materials and partly due to the high cost of production. Capacity utilization has been fairly high in the Manufacture of Non-metallic Products (except Petroleum and Coal) and the Manufacture of Food, Beverages and Tobacco. The utilized capacity has been very low in the Manufacture of Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal, Rubber and Plastic Products. The Manufacture of Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Transport Equipment and the Manufacture of Wood and Wood Products too have experienced relatively low capacity utilization.

Value Added

The value added in the industrial sector during 1974 is given at current prices in Table II (C) 3. The value added was derived by subtracting the cost of raw materials, fuel and power from the total value of output of each reporting firm. The total value added, at current prices, has shown an increase of 33.4 per cent. In real terms, however, the value added decreased by 9.1 per cent in 1974.

T h e Structure of Industry

The value of industrial production by major economic categories for the period 1971—74 are shown in Table II (C) 4.

For the last decade or so the structure of industry in Sri Lanka has been dominated by the production of consumer goods. In 1974, however, the intermediate goods category has shown an increase in value over that of the consumer goods category. This is perhaps due to the heavy increase in the value of petroleum products in that year. The production of investment goods has remained very low largely due to its heavy dependence on imported inputs and the limited size ofthe market.

( 57 )

Distribution of firms based on the value of output as depicted in Table II (C) 5, reveals further concentration of industries. In 1974, 89 per cent of the output was produced by 140 firms whereas in the previous year 86 per cent of the output was produced by 202 firms. The number of smaller firms whose output is less than

Rs. 250,000 has, however, increased considerably. In 1973, 817 firms in this group produced 2.2 per cent of the total output while in 1974 the number of firms producing the same share of output has increased to 1,044.

Employment and W a g e s

The data relating to employment and wages in industry are given in Table II (C) I.

Despite an increase in the number of reporting firms in 1974 over that of the previous year, a considerable drop in the total number of employees as well as in the average man-days per employee has been a noteworthy feature in the industrial sector. The total number of employees in industry in 1974 was 96,668 as reported by 1,497 firms. This represents a drop of 8.6 per cent over the figure reported in the previous year by 1,419 firms. The drop in employment was most conspicuous in the manufacture of Food, Beverages and Tobacco. Although the number of employees fell in 1974, the total wage bill amounted to Rs. 379.7 million, an increase of 18 per cent over the previous year. The wage per man-day too increased from Rs. |2.89 in 1973 to Rs. 18.00 in 1974. The increase in wages was largely due to a considerable increase in the wage rate in that year. The minimum wage index for workers in industry and commerce increased by 18 per cent in 1974 over the previous year.

Table II (C) 6 gives the size distribution of manufacturing firms based on the wage bill. It is noted that 82.6 per cent of the wage bill is paid by a few industrial concerns that form only 6.5 per cent of the total number of firms. It reflects the heavy concentration of employment in large concerns particularly the state cor­porations.

U s e of R a w Materials

The use of raw materials in 1974 is depicted in Tables II (C) 7 and II (C) 8. The former gives the use of local and imported raw materials by major industrial groups, while the latter classifies the raw materials used by their origin. In 1974,the total value of raw materials used in industry represents 62.7 per cent of the value of total output, while in 1973 the same amounted to only 54 per cent. This considerable increase in the cost of raw materials reflects the increase in prices following the oil crisis.

The cost of imported raw materials in 1974 formed 71.6 per cent of the total cost of raw materials in that year, whereas in the previous year imports cost only 66.7 per cent of the total cost of raw materials. This increase in the share of the cost of imported raw materials does not necessarily indicate that local industry used relatively more imported raw materials in 1974; the increase was due primarily to the increase in prices of imports. However, compared with the previous years the value of imports has decreased considerably in the Manufactureof Paper and Paper Products, Non metallic Mineral Products (except Petroleum and Coal), Fabricated Metal Products, and Machinery and Transport,

( 58 )

Little less than half of the raw materials used in industry have been of mineral origin. This is largely due to the very high value of petroleum imports which alone amounted to 37.5 per cent of the total value of raw materials used in the entire industrial sector. Raw materials of agricultural origin formed 30.0 percent, while those of industrial origin formed 24.8 per cent of the total raw materials used in industry. Relatively lower use of industrial intermediate goods in industry is a characteristic of an under developed economy.

U s e Power and Fuel

The most striking feature in 1974 was the steep rise in the cost of power and fuel. The values of power and fuel used in 1974 are given in Table 11(C) 9. Compared with 1973 the total value of power and fuel used has risen by 210 per cent. The most conspicuous was the rise in the value of petrol which amounted to 244 per cent. The increase in the value of coal and gas has been considerable while the increase in the value of electricity was moderate.

The steep increase in the value of power and fuel in 1974 was the direct result of the increase in the price of petroleum products in that year. Therefore, it is most likely that this increase in value does not represent an increase in the quantities of power and fuel consumed in industry in 1974.

Location of Industry

The Table 11(C) 10 depicts the geographical distribution of manufacturing indus­tries in Sri Lanka in 1974. The geographical distribution of industries has changed very little during the last decade or so. Industries are heavily concentrated in the Colombo district where 74 per cent of the total industries are still located. This is some­what less than that in the previous year when the concentration was about 80 percent. In 1974 there has been a greater dispersion of textile industries. Location of indus­tries is determined largely by the availability of raw materials, power, transport and marketing facilities. As a result of the steep rise in oil prices the cost of transport is likely to actasa constraint to further dispersion of industries. Shortage of transport equipment and spares would also act as an additional constraint.
