The data published in this section have been provided by the respective enter­prises: the figures in regard to profits are mostly provisional and subject to revision when audited figures are available. A few corporations1 have not furnished any information at all while some of the others have been unable to give even provisional financial information.

The total number of enterprises at the end of 1974 was 85*; the enterprise established in 1974 is Colombo Dockyard Ltd., a subsidiary of the Shipping Corpora­tion. Colombo Dockyard has been set up to effect ship repairs and ultimately to build shipping vessels.

The investment in public enterprises rose to Rs. 5,390 million from Rs. 4,747 million in 1973. Of the new investment in this sector, 56 per cent was in industry and 25 per cent in the services sector (see Table 2 (D) I).

Employment in public enterprises stood at 260,766 as at the end of 1974 compared with 228,147 as at the end of 1973. The capital invested per employee(viz. the Con­tributed capital, long term liabilities and reserves less accumulated losses) was Rs.24 ( 153 in the industrial sector3 and Rs. 19,354 in the services sector.

2. Industrial Corporations

The total capital investment in the 25 industrial corporations, including the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation, which had not commenced production has increased by 18 per cent from Rs. 1989.4 million in 1973 to Rs. 2346.1 million In 1974. The capital employed in production (value of fixed assets productively employed) was Rs. 2,053 million which accounts for 90 per cent of the total invested capital.

The summary of the performances of industrial corporations is given in table

The value of output at current prices increased by 105 percent to Rs. 2207 million. This high rate of increase was mainly achieved through the escalation of the prices of important imported inputs (on which FEECs are usually payable) as well as because of a higher wage bill. Of the relevant imported inputs, the most important appears to be crude oil the price of which was increased substantially, necessitating an increase in the price of the final products. The increase in the price of furnace oil in particular, led to substantial increases in production costs for the Cement, Steel, Tyre, Ceramics, National Textiles and Hardware Corporations.

In real terms, the production of industrial corporations rose by only about one per cent in relation to 1973. The output in 1974 was below the real output for 1972 by 0.83 per cent. See table 11<D)3

Noteworthy increases in production were registered by the Graphite, Cement and Sugar Corporations (which use mainly domestically produced raw materials) and the Steel and Textiles Corporations (which use mainly imported raw materials). Major declines in production levels were registered by the Petroleum Corporation (which uses imported raw materials) and the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation and the National Milk Board (which use both imported and local raw materials).

As in 1973, capacity utilisation was extremely low. This was particularly noticeable in respect of Fisheries Corporation (due to inability to catch fish in suffi­cient quantities), Oils and Fats Corporation and the National Milk Board (insufficient quantities of local and imported inputs being available and high selling prices leading to a contraction in demand) the Salawa factory of the Plywoods Corporation (insufficient quantities of timber) the Sugar Corporation (insufficient area under cane and low yields) and the Steel Corporation (lack of domestic demand and inability to export due to high costs).

The sales turnover of the production of industrial corporations Increased from

Rs. 1820 million 1973 to Rs. 2414 million in 1974 due substantially tolargeincreases in the prices of the final goods.

The foreign exchange earnings of industrial corporations rose substantially (by 137 per cent) to Rs. 409.3 million. This was mainly dua to increased earnings (by 154 per cent) from petroleum exports and bunkers.

Average rate of return before tax on capital employed in production was 4.8 per cent as against 2.6 per cent in 1973 while the return on investment was 4.3 per cent as against 1.8 per cent in 1973. The total wage bill of the industrial corpora­tions was Rs. 135.6 million1 in 1974 while the number employed was 47,525 persons2.

3. I N D U S T R I A L U N I T S

A . Food, Beverages-and Tobacco

(a) National Milk Board

As in 1973, there was a general decrease in the volume of production in the processing division. The production of pasteurised milk declined by 27 per cent over the 1973 level and by 20 per cent over the 1972 level. The figures for sterlized milk are 26 and 42 per cent respectively. There has also been a noticeable decline in the production of ice cream, muscat, yoghurt and ghee. However, the production of butter {18 per cent over 1973 levels) and cream has increased in 1974.

The production of Lakspray (viz. the quantity packed at the Welisara plant was fractionally higher than in 1973, but lower by 12.5 per cent over the figure for 1972. The output of Vitamilk and Vitamalt declined by 10.7 and 6.9 per cent res­pectively over 1973 levels. The spray drying plant in Ambewela produced 2,641,762 lbs of full cream milk powder which was, however, only 18.6 per cent of the volume of imported full cream milk powder utilised in the production of Lakspray. The plant has been operating at 14.9 per cent capacity in 1974. The production of condensed milk by the Board has declined by 24 and 32 per cent respectively over 1973 and 1972 levels.

Despite (maximum) producer prices being increased by 20 cents per pint In May 1973 or by 44 per cent over the previous levels and by 30 cents in September 1974, which was 111 per cent over 1972 levels, the volume of milk purchased by the Board was less by 3.0 per cent over 1973 and 1.5 per cent over 1972 due to the contraction of the dairy industry on account of escalating prices of feedstock. Moreover, the higher producer prices have also resulted in higher prices of liquid milk to consumers (100 per cent over 1972 levels for pasteurised milk) making liquid milk difficult for the lower income groups to obtain.

The shortfall in the liquid milk intake of the Milk Board has led to both a continued dependence on imports and to a lower overall availability of milk supplied by the Board. The steep increases in prices of imports (on which FEECs are payable) in 1974, in the context of the policy to restrict price increases to a bare minimum, resulted in the Board incurring a loss of Rs. 70.74 million in 1974 compared with

Rs. 40.99 million for 1973.

(b) T h e O i l s & Fats Corporation

The Corporation, which is the major supplier of provender feeds in the country, produced only 43,058 tons in 1974 which was 18.3 and 35.5 per cent below its output of these items for 1973 and 1972 respectively. Only 61.5 per cent of its capacity in respect of provender/feeds was utilised in 1974. The decline in production has had an adverse effect on the dairy, pig and poultry industries. The production of oils by the Corporation was 216 tons compared with 1,080 tons in 1973. The volume of exports of fatty acids and glycerine declined by 33.7 and 74.5 per cent respectively over 1973 levels although export values were 14.2 and 78.3 per cent lower on account of international price trends.

( 89 )

On August 1st, 1974, the selling prices of the products of the Corporation were' increased approximately by 41 per cent in respect of dairy feedstock and 26 per cent in respect of poultry feed. The previous price increase of about 42 and 17 per cent respectively on these items was on February 1st, 1973. The escalating costs of imported and domestically produced inputs (particularly the products of the cocount industry) were responsible, despite the large increases in selling prices, for the Corporation registering an estimated loss of l4.8million in 1974 compared with a loss of Rs. 0.4 million in 1973.

(c) T h e G o v e r n m e n t O w n e d Business Undertaking of the British Ceylon Corporation

According to information furnished by the Company and its two subsidiaries, the British Ceylon Milling Co. and the British Ceylon Extraction Company, a total of 17,459 tons of coconut oil, 489 tons of neutralized oil and 404 tons of deoderized oil together with 5,534 tons of soap and 13,253 tons of animal feed were produced in 1974. There were 1,126 employees in 1974.

The financial data for 1974 were not made available.

(d) S r i Lanka Sugar Corporation

This Corporation provides a noteworthy exception to the industrial corporations in regard to production in real terms in 1974. The higher output of sugar (i.e.a. 56 per cent increase over that ever achieved) in 1974 can be attributed to better per­formance in regard to new planting and cultivation practices In 1972/73 and a higher 'conversion' rate of cane into sugar: the latter is in turn determined by efficiency in harvesting, transport and factory operations. However, due to the non-availability of water in 1974 only a small proportion of the planned acreage was planted. For this reason as well as because of the preference given to paddy cultivation the estimated output for 1975 is only 16,000 tons, despite the expectation of the government to have a total of 20,000 tons of suger for 1975, and in the face of international prices favouring the cultivation of sugar instead of rice. It is a sad fact that the very good performance in production in 1974 should be followed by such a setback to the industry. The production of molasses from cane increased by 23 per cent over the highest figure previously recorded while 1,435,914 gallons of alcohol were manufac­tured in 1974 as against 1,269,000 gallons in 1973. The Corporation also produced 286,315 lbs. of jaggery and 128,004 gallons of syrup at its Uda Walawe Khandasari plant.

Until 1972 the Corporation was paid only the c & f price per ton of sugar. In January 1973 the price paid was increased to Rs 1,904 per ton and in 1974 to Rs 3,136 per ton. The c & f prices for 1973 and 1974 were Rs 1,752.16 and Rs 5,485.75 per ton respectively.

The losses incurred in the production of sugar in 1973 were Rs5. I million while about Rs. 20 million is expected to be earned as profits in 1974. The estimated profit form the production and sale of jaggery and syrup are Rs 2.6 million for 1974 while the supply of seed cane to District Development Authorities is estimated to cost the Corporation Rs 0.887 million. Profits from the production and sale of

( 90 )

alcohol were estimated to be Rs 7.8 million in 1974 as against Rs 7.3 million

1973. The total profits of the Corporation in 1973 were Rs 0.356 million in 1973 while the estimated figure for 1974 is Rs 28.3 million.

(e) State Flour Milling Corporation

The output of wheat flour fell by 28.5 per cent to 46,276 tons while that of atta flour increased by 394 per cent to 25,641 tons. Concomittant to the fall in production of wheat flour, the volume of wheat bran produced declined by 65.4 per cent. In 1974, 3901 tons of wheat bran were exported for Rs 1.85 million (f. o. b.) which was substantial decline over the figure for 1973.

The Corporation had an anticipated profit of Rs 40 million in l974.This was due to two factors. The Food Commissioner paid the Corporation the equivalent of the c & f prices for flour imported by him and the Corporation is called upon to pay approximately U. S. 24 per ton of whole wheat (shipped as containerised cargo) as against approximately U. S. 75 per ton the Food Commissioner has to pay on a ton of flour (imported in bags).

Secondly, the Australian devaluation (without an upward revision of prices that were expressed in Australian currency) also helped to register a 'windfall' profit of about Rs 7 million. The estimated return on capital employed was about 100 per cent in 1974. Although its performance demonstrates its basic viability this Coporatlon produced only 10.5 per cent of the country's imports of flour as it has one mill to operate.

(f) National Salt Corporation

The output of salt declined by 6.5 per cent to 113,387 tons in 1974. There were no exports in this year.

The profit before tax was Rs 2.2 million in 1974 which was a 27.3 per cent return on capital employed. In 1973, the profit was Rs 4.8 million.

(g) Sri Lanka Tobacco Industries Corporation

The output of beedies increased by 5.8 per cent to 45,486 bags.

The total profit of this Corporation was Rs 11.22 million in 1973. The estimated profit for 1974 is Rs 12.0 million.

B - Textiles—Wearing Apparel and Leather Industries

(a) National Textile Corporation

The volume of production by this Corporation in 1974 in respect of its major items reflected an increase on 1973 levels. The production of cloth increased by 15 per cent over 1973 levels and by 8 per cent over 1972 levels. However, if the production of the Pugoda Mill (which was 'commissioned' in 1973) is discounted, the increase in the production of cloth is 11 per cent over 1973 levels. The production of yarn declined by 5 and 4 per cent respectively over 1973 and 1972 levels.

The overall estimated profit was Rs 18.1 million in 1974 compared with Rs 6.5 million for 1973 and Rs 17.9 million for 1972. In terms of capital employed the return on capital excluding the Pugoda Mill was only 5.8 per cent, in 1974.

( 91 )

At the Thulhiriya Mill, output of yarn and sized beams declined by 3 and 35 per cent over 1973 but a substantial increase was recorded in the production of finished cloth (380 per cent) long cloth, (24 per cent) and cloth finished on a commission basis (257 per cent). Employment rose by 13 per cent. Capacity utilisation in respect of spinning, weaving and finishing was 44, 35 and 45 per cent respectively.

At the Veyangoda Mill the output of yarn declined by 10 per over 1973 levels while that of cloth increased by 4 per cent. Capacity utilisation in respect of yarn and cloth was 83 and 55 per cent respectively.

The Pugoda Mill which came into operation (trial production) in April 1974 produced 125,631 lbs. of yarn and 505,120 yards of cloth in 1974.

(b) Ceylon Leather Products Corporation

The production of footwear increased by 15.8 per cent over 1973 levels but was lower by 8 per cent over 1972 levels. The production of chrome and bark leather was lower by 5.4 and 24.0 per cent respectively over 1973 levels and by 0.8 and 49.0 per cent over 1972 levels. Capacity utilisation in 1974 was 80 per cent for footwear, 100 per cent for chrome leather and 54 per cent for bark leather.

There were no exports of footwear in 1974. The volume of exports of chrome leather fell by 84.25 percent over 1973 levels. Despite a general rise in the price of leather goods in the world market in 1974, export earnings of the Corporation declined substantially by 59.2 per cent.

The number of employees increased from 823 to 972 or by 18 per cent.

In 1973 the Corporation made a profit of Rs. 0.4 million; the operations ofthe shoe factory incurred a loss of Rs. 1.5 million. The total profit is estimated to be

Rs. 0.7 million for 1974.

C. W o o d and W o o d Products

(a) Ceylon Plywoods Corporation

The square feet equivalent of major items of production increased by 13.8 per cent over 1973 levels. The expansion mainly arose though an increase in the production of tea chests (full and half by 34.3 and 27.1 per cent respectively)'while the production of other plywood products declined by 13.2 per cent and sawn timber increased by 85.1 per cent. The value of exports in 1974 was Rs. 0.334 million compared with Rs. 0.407 million for 1973.

Capacity utilisation in 1974 was 75.3 per cent in respect of plywood products at Gintota, 30.3 per cent in respect of plywood production in Salawa, and 29.7 and 12.4 per cent for chipboard manufacture and sawn timber respectively in Salawa.

All the production and trading activities of the Corporation ran at a loss in 1973, with the overall figure being Rs. 6.927 million. The estimated profit for 1974 was Rs. 1.5 million which was 1.0 per cent on the capitalemployed.

( 92 )

(b) State Timber Corporation

This Corporation's main activities consist of obtaining timber from state owned land (on the payment of a royalty to the Forest Department) getting the private sector to fell and transport unsawn timber to its mills and the sale of sawn and unsawn timber. It also produces and sells railway sleepers and electrical transmission poles to state organisations.

In terms of the volume of its turnover, there was little change in 1974 over the level in 1973. The volume of sawn timber produced by the Corporation declined by 10.4 per cent while the volume of logs handled increased by 10.5 per cent to 2,672,000 cubic feet.

The profit of this Corporation, which is largely a trading organisation, was Rs.6.41 million in 1973 which was 15.8 per cent of its turnover or 11.4 per cent on the capital employed. The estimated profit for 1974 was Rs 3.0 million which was 6.8 per cent on sales turnover.

D. Paper & Paper Products. Printing and Publishing

(a) Eastern Paper Mills Corporation

The production of paper and paper board declined substantially (by 10.6 per cent) in 1974 as did the production of paper bags (by 7.6 per cent.) The shortfall in production can be mainly attributed to the decline in the availability of imported pulp (by 34.7 per cent) which was only partially offset by an increased intake of (local) waste paper. The average c. i. f. price of imported pulp and chemicals rose by 58.1 and 42.0 per cent respectively.

The prices of products manufactured were increased by approximately 90 per cent on May 20th 1974. The estimated profit for 1974 was Rs. 16.7 million of this figure, Rs. 73 million came from the sale of imported paper and paper products. The return on capital employed was 7.7 per cent in 1974.

(b) State Printing Corporation

The estimated value of the work done by the Corporation In 1974 was Rs. 10.1 million as against Rs. 6.0 million in 1973.

The estimated profit for 1974 was Rs. 1.3 million while the profit for 1973 was

Rs. 0.67 million,

The estimated return on capital employed was 6.7 per cent in 1974.

E. Chemicals, Petroleum, Rubber & Plastic Products

(a) Paranthan Chemicals Corporation

The production of caustic soda, liquid chlorine and table salt, the more important items produced by this Corporation declined by 10.6, 11.1 and 19.5 per cent res­pectively over 1973 levels. The production of hydrochloric acid increased by 0.3 per cent. There were no exports in 1974. Capacity utilisation was 82.7 per cent in respect of caustic soda and 49.6 and 24.6 per cent for chlorine and hydrochloric acid in 1974.

( 93 )

The net estimated profit for 1974 from manufacturing and allied activities was

Rs. 1.461 million and from imports, Rs. 1.541 million. The profit from manufacturing showed a return of 12-2 per cent on capital employed.

c (b) Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (manufacturing activities)

The overall output of major petroleum products the refinery showed a significant fall of 248,754 tons or 14.0 per cent over 1973 levels. Compared with the output in 1973, the volume of kerosene, gasolene, naptha, diesolene, furnace oil, aviation turbine fuel and bitumen produced declined by 21,20, 16, 13, 12, 20 and 21 per cent respectively. The refinery also produced 715 tons of petroleum gas which is a substitute for kerosene, firewood and coal gas.

The average c & f price of the major import, crude oil, increased from Rs 148 per ton to Rs 561.57 per ton, an increase of 279 per cent. W i t h the increase in the international prices for petroleum products, (on which the transfer prices paid to the refinery by the Corporation are determined), the value of the refinery's produ-tion were higher at Rs 949.4 million over the 1973 figures of Rs 378.9 million. The revised accounts for the refinery's operations for 1973 show a profit of Rs 30.5 million, which was a return of 18 per cent on the capital employed. The estimated figures for 1974 were not made available.

The volume of lubricants processed by the blending plant (3,136,717 gallons) declined by 22 per cent over 1973 levels. The profit on operations in 1973 was

Rs 4.66. million or 22 per cent on capital employed.

The production of candles declined by 9 per cent over 1973 levels.

(c) S r i Lanka T y r e Corporation

The output of this Corporation in terms of standard tyres (viz. a tyre weighing 33 kilograms or ofthe size 750 x 20) was 121,600 nos. in I 974 compared with 100,076 nos.,in 1973 and 111,308 nos. in 1972. Capacity utilisation was 90.7 per cent in 1974.

In the years 1973 and 1974 the profit per standard tyre was Rs. 44.00 and Rs. 48-0. respectively. The amount of expenditure on labour per standard tyre rose by 60 per cent in 1974 while expenditure on inputs rose by 4.8 per cent. There were two price increases on I 973 price levels. The first one (on December I 4, 1973) was in the region of 40 per cent while the second one (on December 16, 1974) was in the region of 75 per cent. Rs. 5.8 million was obtained as the estimated profit for 1974 which was 6.4 per cent on the capital invested.

(d) Ceylon Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation

No data were made available in respect of 1974.

(e) State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation

No production data were available for 1974 as the Corporation has not

commenced production.

This Corporation was established in 1966.

( 94 )

(F) Non-Metallic Mineral Product (except petroleum products)

(a) Ceylon Ceramics Corporation

There has been a marginal decline in the output of crockery in 1974 while the output of the other products increased in relative terms.

The foreign exchange expenditure on imported inputs utilised in production

as well as the opportunity cost of the furnace oil consumed amounted to Rs. 5.7 million, while the Corporation earned Rs. 0.7 million from exports and Rs. 1.0 million (net of FEECs) from local sales for which payment was received in foreign currency.

The fuel bill of the Corporation rose by 107 per cent in I 974 to Rs. 7.2 million. Despite this, the costs of production of the items produced do not appear to have changed much over 1973 levels. There was an upward revision of prices on June 29th, 1974. The estimated profits for 1974 were Rs. 10.8 million which was 14.8

per cent on the capital employed in production and were higher by Rs. 2.1 million over the figure for 1973.

(b) Lanka Porcelain L t d .

This venture which is basically a subsidiary of the Ceramics Corporation, where

33 per cent of the issued capital has been contributed by Noritake of Japan, comm­enced operations in October 1973.

While there were no exportsirr 1973, the f.o.b. value of exports in 1974 was

Rs. 5.35 million. The c.i.f. value of imported raw materials used in manufacture in 1974 was Rs. 3.31 million.

The output in 1974 was 2,684,689 pieces of crockery of which 15 per cent was sold domestically.

Capacity utilisation (in terms of number of pieces of porcelain) was 65 per cent in 1974 which was due to large items in terms of body weight being manufactured.

The number employed in 1974 were 604.

The loss in 1973 was Rs. 2.0 million and in 1974 it was Rs. 1.7 million.

(c) Ceylon Cement Corporation

The output of cement reached 466,136 tons in 1974 which was an increase of 10.9 per cent over the I 973 level and 19.1 per cent over the 1972 level. The utlisation of capacity was76and 67 percent in the Kankesanturai and Puttalam plants respectively.

The Corporation used Rs. 11.8 million worth of foreign exchange resources plus 11,379,270 gallons of furnace oil which could have been exported for Rs. 17,742,900 f.o.b. The foreign exchange thus directly expended on the production of a ton of cement is Rs. 63.49.

A noteworthy feature in 1974 is that 40,516 tons of cement were exported from Kankesanturai factory which earned a figure of Rs. 12.5 million f.o.b. Export revenue

was as high as Rs. 509 per ton, inclusive of FEECs, which was substantially above the average sales price of cement sold in the domestic market.

The prices of cement were raised by approximately II per cent on January 22,1973, by approximately 20 percent on February 18th 1974,and again by approxi­mately 23 per cent on December 16, 1974 The estimated profit for 1974 before tax was Rs. 21.7 million which was a 6.5 per cent return on capital employed. The profit in 1973 was Rs. 12.0 million.

(d.) Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation

In relation to the figures for 1973, the production of ilmenite declined by 13.2 per cent to 79,817 tons while that of rutile increased by 35.5 per cent to 3,000 tons. Exports in 1974 were lowerin respect of ilmenite by 2,322 tons and in respect of rutlla by 445 tons. However, higher f.o.b. prices were realised, resulting in a higher value of sales in l974,viz.Rs. 16.299million compared with Rs. 11.880 million in 1973.

The Corporation earned a profit of Rs. 4.29 million in 1973 and Rs. 7.31 million in 1974 on which the return on capital employed was 35.3 per cent.

(e) S t a t e Graphite Corporation

This Corporation owns and operates four mines viz the Bogala mine (nationalised on May 18th, 1971 but vested in the Corporation on January I, 1974), the Kolongaha mine (from October 22, 1971), the Kahatagaha mine, (from April 21st, 1972) and the Ragala mine (where the Corporation began prospecting for graphite from July 1st, 1973). The production of graphite in 1974 increased by 34 per cent over 1973. Comparing 1974 with 1972, the first year of operations after nationalisation, there has been an increase in production of 11.4 per cent at Bogala 64.0 per cent at Kolongaha and 283.3 per cent at Kahatagaha. The volume of graphite produced and exported in 1974 was 10,262 and 9,622 tons respectively while export earnings were Rs. 18.3 million.

Although substantial progress has been achieved in 1974 in relation to the performance in the first year of operations after nationalisation (1972) it has to be noted that both in 1973 and 1972 the volume of production was substantially lower (by 20.1 and 27.8 per cent respectively) over the export volume, as recorded by the Customs, for 1970 and still substantially lower than the export volume for any year in the period 1965—69 (see table ll(D)7A).The average annual volume of exports in the period 1965—70 was 10,065 tons while the export availability for 1974 viz. the output for 1974(10,262) tons less domestic consumption (137) tons, was 10,125 tons. If the period 1968—70 (when FEECs were payable on export earnings) is considered, the average annual export volume is 10,667 tons which is 5.4 per cent higher than the 10,125 tons available for export from the 1974 output and 9.8 per cent higher than the actual volume of graphite exported (9,622 tons) in 1974.

The Corporation earned an estimated profit of Rs. 11 million in 1974 compared with a profit of Rs. 7.7 million in 1973. The higher profit was obtained largely as a result of increased production and sales.

(a) Ceylon Steel Corporation

The output of rolled products, at 28,982 tons, rose by 21.2 per cent in 1974 though it was lower than in 1972 by 36.2 per cent. Capacity utilisation was 33.3

per cent. However, the output of wire products rose substantially to 7,234 tons or by 68 per cent. There were no exports in 1974.

The profit in 1974 was Rs. 25.5 million which was a return of 15.3 per cent on the capital employed. The profit in 1973 was Rs. 12.8 million. The profit per ton of rolled product rose to Rs. 729 in 1974 from Rs. 471 in 1973. The average cost per ton rose by Rs. 684 and and the average revenue by Rs. 942. Steel prices were raised substantially in February 1974.

H . Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery and Equipment

(a) S t a t e H a r d w a r e Corporation

The production of mammoties and other agricutlural implements declined by 5

and I per cent respectively over 1973 levels while the production of sanitaryware, engineering tools and cutlery declined by 33.44 and 5 per cent respectively. As in the previous year, the production of cast iron products at the foundry declined in 1974 and was only 51.7 per cent of installed capacity; this relatively poor performance

is due to difficulties in marketing more cast iron products in the domestic and foreign markets. Althoughthe Value of exports of castiron products was Rs.02.40 million in 1973, in 1974 there were no exports of cast iron or any other product of the Corporation.

The cost of production of most items rose by approximately 35 per cent in 1974 relative to 1973 levels due mainly to an increase in the cost of imported raw material

(on which FEECs are payable). There was a substantial rise (of about 50 per cent)

on March 30, 1974 in the prices of most items produced. The estimated loss for 1974 is Rs. 3 million while the loss incurred in 1973 was Rs. 4.4 million.

4. O t h e r Public Enterprises

A . Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing

(a) Ceylon Fisheries Corporation

The production of wet and frozen fish in 1974, at 4,364.99 tons, was 4.4 per cent higher than in 1973 but was lower over the output for 1971 by 4.2 per cent. There was a decline of 25.8 per cent in the volume of shark liver oil produced. Dry fish production increased by 48.4 per cent to 275.82 tons which was, however, only 2.2 per cent of total imports of dry fish. The production of canned fish declined by 49.5 per cent. The number of fishing boats manufactured declined from 60 to 25 or by 58.3 per cent. However, there was an increase in the production of ice by 942 per cent. This Corporation, which has been in operation since 1965 in competition with the private sector, has yet to make a significant impact on the fishing industry in Sri Lanka.

Export earnings from fish increased to Rs. 2.7 million which was Rs. 10.1 per cent of export earnings from these products for 1974. Thef.o.b. earnings from canned fish was Rs. 0.2 million while the net foreign exchange earnings from fishing operations off the coast of Malaysia were Rs. 0.412 million.

The number ofemployees declined to 1,143 from 1,308 in 1974.

The Corporation continued to make losses, with a figure of Rs. 6.0 million for 1973 and an estimated figure of Rs. 1.9 million for 1974.

(b) S t a t e Plantations Corporation

During the year under review the State Plantations^Corporation managed 67 plantations as against 29 in the previous year. The total cultivated acreage planted has increased by 86 per cent from 39,235 to 73,164 acres. This was due to the policy adopted by the Land Reform Commission to hand over the more productive estates vested in it to this Corporation and the purchase of some estates owned by Sterling Plantation Companies. The extent of land involved was 16,256 acres of tea 3365 acres of rubber and 6021 acres of coconut. The Corporation is now by far the largest individual owner of land in Sri Lanka.

The gross profit per cultivated acre of tea was Rs. 255 in 1974 while it was Rs. 251 per employee. From plantations and factories taken together the Corporation has made an estimated gross profit of Rs. 13.1 million in 1974.

Basic statistics on the operation of this Corporation in 1974 are found in table

II (D) 8.

B. Transport. Storage and Communications

(a) Ceylon Transport Board

Although the fleet owned by the C.T.B. increased to 7,005 vehicles from 6,643 the deficit between the average fleet operated and the numbers required was 974 in 1974 compared with 660 in 1973 and 180 in 1972. The average vehicle utilisation per day fell to 149 miles from 150 miles in 1973 and 154 miles in 1972.

e) Estimated.

( l<* )

The mileage operated by the Board was 234,765 million in 1974, and was the lowest since 1969/70 and only 77.6 per cent of the scheduled mileage. The scheduled mileage in 1974 was 2.5 per cent lower than the scheduled mileage for 1973 due to the operation of the five day week. The lost mileage was higher by 9.1 per cent over 1973 and by46.1 per cent over I972and the highest ever recorded. Thetotal seat mileage was 7.4 per cent below 1973 and 13.7 per cent below 1972 levels, while the number of passenger miles, at 7,904 million miles, was 14.1 and 9.1 per cent lower over 1973 and 1972 levels. The load factor, at 63.8 per cent, was nearly 5 per cent lowerthan in 1973 despite the incentive scheme for bus crews that was introduced in 1974. The number of permanent employees per bus operated was 12.3 in 1974 compared with 11.5 in 1973.

On account of the substantial rise in bus fares (by about 25 per cent), revenue from passenger fares rose by 159.990 million or by 38.6 per cent over 1973 levels. Expenditure too rose by Rs. 108.341 million or by 23.3 per cent over 1973 so that the loss of Rs. 33.84 million for 1973 had become a profit of Rs. 21.20 million for 1974.

(b) Ceylon Government Railway

The numbers of passenger miles- were estimated to have increased by II per. cent in 1974, and the numbers of goods miles were estimated to have increased by 5.5 per cent.

The revenue was estimated to rise to Rs. 186.2 million in 1974 which was a 24.2 per cent increase over 1973 levels while the corresponding figure for expenditure were Rs. 228.2 million and 36.1 per cent respectively. The loss for 1973 was

Rs. 63.2 million and the estimated loss for 1974, Rs. 89.1 million.

(c) Colombo Port Commission

Revenue rose by 15.6 per cent to Rs. 47.18 million while working expenditure rose 3.0 per cent to Rs. 31.56 million. The number of employees declined to 8113 in December 1974 compared with 8204 in December 1973.

(d) Port (Cargo) Corporation

Certain salient aspects of the operations of the Corporation in the last four financial years are shown in table II (D) 9.

The cargo handled at the Colombo and Galle Ports continued to decline in 1974 while it was marginally higher than in 1973 at the Trincomalee port. The revenue of the Corporation fell by Rs. 5.6 million and as a result the overall loss was doubled from Rs. 5.1 million iii 1973 to Rs. 10.4 million in the year under review. The numbers employed at the Colombo Port declined by 2,103 in 1974 over the previous year to 12,897 persons.

(e) Postal &|Telecommunication Services

As in 1973, no data were furnished.

(f) Ceylon Shipping Corporation

The Ceylon Shipping Corporation has increased the scale of its operations over the years since it was set up in June 1971. The capital contributed by the government was Rs. 41.8 million in 1974 as against Rs. 17.1 million in the preceding year. The

( '04 )

increase in expenditure, by Rs. 49.4 million, was more than offset by the increase in revenue, by Rs. 68.4 million, and the Corporation's profit for the year under review has increased by 139 per cent to Rs. 32.8 million. The net profit from the chartering of foreign vessels was Rs. 7.8 million in 1974.

In view of the Corporation's inability to supply the required information it was not possible to compute its net foreign exchange earnings.

C. Wholesale and Retail Trade

(a) Co-operative W h o l e s a l e Establishment ( C . W . E.)

Certain basic statistics relating to the C . W . E . are given in Table II (D) 10 on the basis of estimated data for 1974. The general turnover of this establishment in 1974 remained at 1973 levels. There was a fall in the value of imports from Rs. 109 million in 1973 to Rs. 92 million in 1974 which was offset by an increase in local purchases. Receipts from sales were almost static but the profit before tax-fell from Rs. 18.4 million in 1973 to Rs. 14.7 million in 1974 mainly due to an increase in the wage bill.

(b) Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (turnover and operations)

As in 1973, there was a fall in the volume of crude oil imports (by 13.8 per cent). However, the c&f values of imports of crude oil and petroleum products at Rs. 903.55 million were 204.4 per cent higher over the figure for 1973 due to higher international prices.

The overall volume of sales of major products (kerosene, petrol, desolene, aviation turbine fuel, furnace oil, naptha, bitumen and lubricants) was substantially lower (by32percent) overthe 1973 figure.Therewasageneral increase in the volumeof exports and supply of bunkers. Thefall in the volume of sales can be mainly attributed to a contraction of domestic demand following the substantial increase in the sales prices of petroleum products on January 8, 1974.

The higher domestic prices, however, resulted in a higher value of sales to the domestic market and the higher international prices to enhanced export earnings

(Rs. 88.7 million in 1974 from Rs. 27.0 million in 1973) and earnings from bunkers

< '05 )

Rs. 1.0 million in the preceding year. The Corporation had Rs. 212.0 million worth of fertilizer in stock at the end of 1974 compared with Rs. 191.23 million at the end of 1973.

(d) S t a t e G e m Corporation

There was a 48.9 per cent fall in sales from Rs. 45 million in 1973 to Rs. 23 .million in the first nine months of 1974 which could be attributed mainly to uncertainities prevailing in the market for gems in the first half of 1974 The Corporation's exports for 1974 were Rs. 15.6 million which was 13.1 per cent of the value of total exports of gems.

Purchases of precious and semi-precious stones amounted to Rs. 8.8 million in the first three quarters of 1974 compared to Rs. 107 million in 1973. The Cor­poration has attempted to reduce its stocks of gems, which were substantial at the beginning of the year through reduced purchases.

(e) Paddy Marketing B o a r d

The total value of paddy purchased by the Paddy Marketing Board increased by 59 per cent from Rs. 458 million in 1973 to Rs. 728 million in 1974 inspite of the dec­rease in the volume of purchases by 8 per cent. This was due to the increase in the purchase price of a bushel of paddy from Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 in March from Rs. 30to

Rs. 33 in July 1974.

The net profit of the Board before tax was Rs. 15 million in 1974 as against Rs. 24 million in 1973. The number employed by the Board increased by 179 persons to 2502 persons in 1974.

The Board succeeded in purchasing only 27.2 per cent of the estimated paddy crop for 1974 which was the poorest performance recorded by the state purchasing agency in respect of paddy purchases for many years. This performance was regis­tered in the context of the enactment and enforcement of stringent regulations to help the state to purchase a large proportion ofthe paddy output.

(f) Sri Lanka S t a t e Trading (General) Corporation

A noteworthy feature both in 1973 and 1974 was that the motor department which was running at a loss began to earn profits {Rs. 3.2 million in 1973 and Rs. 4.8 million in 1974). This has been principally achieved through a reduction in claims.

(Rs. 16.8 million was paid out in 1974 compared with Rs. 17.2 million in 1973 and

Rs. 25.21 million and Rs. 20.78 million respectively in the two preceding years.) Similarly, in the fire department, claims were reduced from Rs. 6.1 million in 1972 to Rs. 1.4 million in 1974.
