The extent of these increases is hardly surprising in an year when price increases were pronounced and necessitated a number of supplementary estimates being presented to the National State Assembly. In real terms, however, the increases in recurrent and capital expenditures over the previous year would not be that substantial due to the pronounced price increases during the year.",

A high proportion of the supplementary estimates passed during the year was related to the price escala\u00adtions which tended to throw out of gear the estimates originally approved for the year by the National State Assembly. Even so, the actual expenditure in relation to voted expenditure (including supplementary votes), particularly in respect of capital votes, shows an under-expenditure of 25 per cent. Total revenue, too, well ex\u00adceeded the original expectations by Rs. 680 million, largely brought about by in\u00adcreases in our domestic and export prices. Consequently, the budget deficit showed an increase of only Rs. 136 million over the originally estimated figure. Although",

An otherwise impressive performance has thus to be tempered by the thought that the favourable prices of exports and the increased prices of im\u00adports have contributed in a large way to this increase. While it is true that taxes with a domestic base have come to contribute an increasing proportion of the total tax revenue, the foreign trade sector based taxes have still a large role to play in determining the amount of resources available to the government. Indeed, as stated by the Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for 1975, a given volume of foreign aid could under present conditions generate an equivalent amount as local revenue to the government by way of FEECs, import duties and business turnover taxes1. It is also to be seen that foreign aid thus enhances the productivity of taxes which",

    "text": "As mentioned earlier, the budgetary operations in 1974 have produced only a marginal net expansionary impact of Rs. 24 million. In 1973, the fiscal operations of the government had resulted in a net contractionary effect of Rs. 53 million. A s seen from table II (G) I, fiscal operations of the government prior to 1973 have con\u00adsistently created substantial expansionary impacts with the peak year being in 1969/70 when it amounted to Rs. 425 million. The fact that during the last two years the impact has been contained at manageable levels is in no small measure due to the substantial volume of resources the government has managed to raise from the do\u00admestic non-bank sector, principally through the medium of rupee loans. While, these long-term borrowings have been largely made available through ' captive sources' like the Employees' Provident Fund, National Savings Bank and the In\u00adsurance Corporation of Sri Lanka, the interest costs of such borrowings, too, have continued to exhibit a pronounced increase in recent years. A detailed analysis of the reasons behind the higher availability of funds from the non-bank sources and the consequent increase in the interest bill to the government has been made elsewhere 2. However, it is heartening to note that despite the increase in the interest bill and consequently the current expenditure, the government has gene\u00adrated current account surpluses of reasonable magnitudes in the last two financial years. Perhaps, emphasis on the productivity of these borrowed funds which are obtained at a certain cost to the government would go a considerable way in improving the operations of the government both in respect to the volume of funds available for its capital expenditure as well as the contri\u00adbution of the government towards the growth of the economy.",

The increase in revenue was achieved despite the fact that no new revenue measures of any signficant financial impact were announced in the Budget for 1974 nor any mea\u00adsures adopted during the course of the year. From an overall point of view two factors have played their part in generating this impressive record in respect of government/savings. Firstly, the revenue base became highly productive on account of the more favourable prices of our exports during the year while on the other hand, the higher availability of foreign finance together with the general increase in import prices has also helped to produce a higher revenue. Thus despite there being no radical changes in the tax rates, a higher level of revenue receipts was recorded helped also by the rise in local prices. Secondly, equally significant is the contribution on the expenditure side of the measures adopted by the government in trying to contain the food subsidy, in an year when the escalation of import prices and local prices could have, in the absence of these measures, produced an alarm\u00ading subsidy bill.",

While food subsidy as a proportion of total recurrent expenditure has marginally increased from 18 per cent to 20 per cent in 1974, it is also noteworthy that this proportion had more or less remained around this figure during the last four years despite the increase in the cost of food stuffs.

The revenue performance of the year under review served to highlight the high dependency of the elasticity of the tax system particularly on the taxes based on foreign trade transactions. In other words, one important reason for the relatively unproductive nature of our main tax sources in the past has been the poor performance of our exports particularly price wise. The very same reason explains the frequent resort to measures which either involved widening the tax base or changes in the rates of taxes. This only serves to high\u00adlight the need to curtail recurrent expenditure, particularly those items like the food subsidy that have an inbuilt elasticity, to levels consistent with the increases that the revenue system can produce, when the performance of the foreign trade sector is not too encouraging.",

Overall the picture that emerges from the table, judging by the performance during the last two years, appears to be encouraging. Firstly, it has been possible to generate current account surpluses of reasonable magnitudes in the last two financial years. In fact, the record in this respect in 1974 is quite impressive when almost one fifth of the financing required for capital expenditure has been met by government's own savings. Another noteworthy feature has been that the growth of recurrent expenditure has been less than the growth in G N P . Recurrent expenditure which since 1967/68 had tended to outstrip the growth of",

As noted later in detail, the extent of under-expenditure in respect of capital votes has been progressively increasing from about 15 per cent and currently stands at 25 per cent or a quarter of the voted expenditure. Indeed, when the budget proposals are presented to the National State Assembly an across the board cut of 25 per cent is allowed in respect of the anticipated under-expenditure on account of capital votes. The actual outturn during the financial year largely bears out this expect\u00adation. It may be that a large proportion of these unspent monies are related to projects on which some foreign exchange expenditure is involved. Hence any de\u00adlay in the latter might delay the process of expending these monies. Yet it is im\u00adperative that an attempt be made to avoid under-expending voted monies by as much",

    "text": "Moreover, even the actual capital expenditure as reflected in the Government Accounts for a particular year does not appear to bear any relation to the actual monies spent during the course of that year. This is because monies voted, particularly for public corporations, though they are transferred to the respective corporations before the end of the financial year very often merely represent book entries and do not actually get spent during the same year. These amounts so transfered are not actually spent but are credited to Treasury deposit accounts at the end of each fiscal year. While the Government Accounts reflect these transfers as expenditure, the corresponding \"Deposits\" with the Treasury get reflected on the financing side as \"administrative borrowings\" or domestic non-market borrowings which were to finance this expenditure. On the other hand, the deposits with the treasury are run down when they get expended by the corporations during the course of a particular year although the monies so spent may not have been voted during that year. The Treasury, however, has since been discouraging this practice after attention was drawn to this phenomenon which has often tended in recent years to over state the true magnitude of capital expenditure as per government accounts.* Indeed during the year under review an amountof Rs. 65 million representing such deposits built up in the past by several public corporations has been removed from the Government Accounts by the device of crediting such deposits to the Revenue Account. In our re-classified figures of Government revenue, however, an adjustment for the consequent inflation of the revenue has been made to show the real extent of the revenue increase during 1974.",

    "text": "( 158 ) In recent years capital transfers to public corporations have come to account for on an average about one third of the total capital expenditure of the government. W i t h the increase in the number of such corporations, it is to be expected that the magnitude of these transfers both for establishing new as well as augmenting the existing ones will continue to increase. To the extent that these monies are voted through the budget, while the operations of these corporations are decentralised, it is vitally important that they should not merely be made viable concerns but also made to repay the cost of this capital to the government. Failure of the corpora\u00adtions to run profitably and efficiently not merely has an effect on the budget in the form of an interest subsidy on such transfers but also increases the current expen\u00additure of the government when the latter is compelled to re-imburse the losses incurred. W i t h the increasing role envisaged for these corporations it is import\u00adant to ensure that the investment of public funds in these corporations are suffi\u00adciently productive. The government has, indeed, adopted a number of measures, including the passage of the 'Finance Act No. 38 of 1971 ' with this object in view. However, it is evident that the actual performances of many state corporations have failed to measure upto the targets expected of them.",

    "text": "As in recent years, these taxes have continued to be an elastic and productive source of government revenue in 1974. The collections from this source have re\u00adcorded an increase of Rs. 70 million over that of 1973. They are also Rs. 110 mil\u00adlion more than the collections anticipated in the approved estimates for 1974, where in it was expected that the collections would fall by Rs. 40 million on account of the lowered rates and rationalisation of the tax structure. The increase in prices of commodities, which enhanced the value of the turnover in money terms, is the primary cause for the increase in the collections from this source. Roughly five sixths of the total collections are in respect of manufacturing and the balance from the non-manufacturing turnover. Collections from both these categories showed increases in 1974 with the former bringing in Rs. 495 million while the latter pro\u00adduced Rs. 109 million. In the manufacturing sector while most categories of manu\u00adfactures turned in increased turnover tax collections, it is significant that about half the turnover tax collected on manufacturing was from the manufacture of pet\u00adrol. Petrol prices were doubled at the beginning of 1974 and have in a large way enhanced the turnover. W i t h the creation of the State Distilleries Corporation the turnover of the manufacture of arrack has also become liable to a 5 per cent tax and contributed to the enhanced collections in 1974. Turnover tax collections in 1975 are expected to be around the same level as in 1973.",

Import duty collections in respect of almost all the items except prepared food stuffs, beverages, tobacco, etc. have recorded increases ove 1973. Then collections of duty in respect ofproductsof chemical and allied industries including fertilizer have almost doubled due to the very steep rise in prices of these items. Marked increases were also recorded under paper making materials, textiles and textile articles, base metal and articles of metal. The increase in the import duty receipts has been solely due to very high increases in prices, since the volume of imports was lower. The actual receipts from import duties in 1974 have been lower than the approved estimates by Rs. 16 million mainly due to the lower volume of imports.",

The net food subsidy is arrived at by setting off the profits from the import and sale of certain food items (mainly sugar and flour in the past) from the gross food subsidy. The gross food subsidy consists of net payments on account of the issue of rice on ration, the producer subsidy under the guaranteed price scheme for paddy and the subsidy on the import and sale of foodstuffs, such as dhall, sugar and infants milk food. Whereas in the period prior to 1970/71 the import and sale of sugar and flour used to consistently result in a profit, the trend in recent times has been less consistent with the sale of these items involving losses (and therefore increasing the gross food subsidy) in some years. The distribution expenses and other charges in respect of these items are also taken into account in computing the net food sub\u00adsidy.",

On the other hand, sugar continued to be rationed at a heavily subsidised price of 72 cents per pound. The quantum of sugar issued under ration was reduced from I lb. to f lb. per person and off-ration sales (except to specified categories of institutions) were completely stopped. Consequently, there was a considerable reduction of 94,700 tons in the issues of sugar when compared with the previous year.

    "text": "The year under review is unique in that for the first time in many years there were no profits from the sale of foodstuffs in 1974. The only item on the sale of which profits were received continuously was sugar and on this, too, a loss of Rs. 43 million was incurred in 1974. It has been the implied policy objective to offset part of the cost of the gross food subsidy by the profits the government used to obtain by the sale of sugar and flour by selling these items freely. With the emphasis shifting to a curtailed distribution of both sugar and flour on account of the fact that both these commodities are essentially imported and their prices had increased substantially, sales were restricted. Rationing was thus employed more with the aim of curtailing losses once it became clear that whatever profits there were to be had by selling these items freely and at flexibly determined prices would not justify the foreign exchange cost of importing these items, nor the consequent increase in the cost of living such a measure would have induced.",

There had been a declining trend in the profits to be had from the sale of sugar in the past few years and this was mainly due to the increased landed cost of sugar. In 1973, the landed cost of sugar increased by Rs. 1087/-to Rs. 3093/-per long ton-an almost three-fold increase. Thisincrease in the cost of sugar more than offset the combined effect of the increase in the sale price of off-ration sugar2 and the reduction in the quantum of sugar issued under the ration. In February 1973 the quantum of sugar under the ration was fixed at one pound per person and from October, 1973 at three quarter pound per person while the price of ration sugar continued unchanged at 72 cents per pound. The reduction in the sale of off-ration sugar and the increase in the cost of FEECs to 65 per cent also contributed to the lower profits.",

W h a t has been achieved since 1970/71 (as the table below shows) by cutting down on real consumption based on rationing has been quite impressive. As compared with the per capital distribution in 1970/71 rice and sugar distribution have been cut down by 43 per cent and 65 per cent res\u00adpectively, though flour distribution per capita has increased by 8 per cent.

    "text": "In the financial year 1974, the total provision (including supplementary provisions) in respect of capital expenditure amounted to Rs. 1690 million, whereas the actual expenditure was Rs. 1277 million. Consequently, the extent of under-expenditure in 1974 was Rs. 413 million or 24.5 per cent, in comparison with an under-expenditure figure of Rs. 273 million or 19.8 per cent in 1973. Although the extent of under expenditure has risen by almost five percentage points in 1974, it corresponds to the level of under-expenditure as anticipated in the budget for the year. It will be seen from the table II (G) 13 below that over the years the across the board under expenditure provision in respect of capital votes has progressively been increased and currently stands at 25 per cent or a quarter of the capital expenditure. What is more, the actual under-expenditure over the years have more or less tended to bear out the original expectations. A more accurate estimate of planned expediture would perhaps eliminate this recurring problem which has tended lately to make the budgeted figures look unrealistic. It is evident from the detailed analysis of under-expenditure of the various ministries that a high degree of co-relation exists between under-expenditure by ministries and the availability of supporting foreign exchange expenditure during the year.",

There has simultaneously been a decreased reliance on Treasury bills. The enlargement of the \"captive sector\" for government securities, which came about in recent years with the centralisation of government savings institutions in the form of the National Savings Bank, and the extension of the coverage of the E. P. F. scheme, have largely accounted for the increased flow of funds to the government loan programmes. The volume of resources available in these forms for investment in government securities may be expected to steadily increase for sometime in the future. Hitherto, the bulk of these funds have been invested in rupee securities since they guaranteed a rate of return which enabled the government and semi-government investors, in particular the National Savings Bank, to attract deposits by offering attractive rates of interest (along with tax reliefs). Yet it is equally true that unless the investment outlets of such institutions are widened their heavy dependence on this type of investment might prove embarrassing to the government.",

As the following table II (G) 16 shows, expenditure on interest on domestic debt by the government which are in the nature of transfer payments (particularly since 1970 when the rate of interest payable on 10\u201412 years securities was fixed at 9 per cent) has shown a rapid increase. Between 1969/70 and the year under review the interest bill on domestic debt has more than doubled and now accounts for 12 per cent of the total current expenditure of the government. The table also shows that it is the interest payment on rupee loans that has largely contributed to this increase in the interest bill on domestic debt.",

However, the total amount of unfunded debt outstanding at the end of the financial year was Rs.2,816 million which is Rs. 44 million more than over the previous financial year. This increase is mainly due to the increase in the amount of tax reserve certificates and Central Bank advances outstanding. The incr\u00adeasing share of the funded debt reflects the heavy reliance of government budgets on the borrowing from non-bank sources through the issue of rupee securities in recent years.",

On the other hand.the share of securities in the 20 to 25 years group which at the end of the financial year 1969/70 was 23 per cent of the total domestic public debt has declined very sharply to a ne\u00adgligible percentage (0.4 per cent) at the end of 1974, owing to the non-issue of long-term rupee securities for the past few years. If this policy is continued in the fu\u00adture, securities with a maturity period of 15 years and over will progressively be eliminated from the maturity spectrum of domestic debt. As stressed in the annual report of the previous year, the issue of longer term securities in the future could well ease the problem of the public debt management which the government may have to encounter.",

    "text": "The National Savings Bank (which since April 1972 took over the investments of the Post Office Savings Bank, Ceylon Savings Bank and the Savings Certificates fund) was the largest contributor to rupee securities in 1974. Its contributions during the year at Rs. 333 million reached the highest recorded investment in rupee securities since 1962/63 by a single investor, both in absolute and relative terms. The deposits with the National Savings Bank (including Savings Certificates) increased by Rs. 204 million during the year under review. Higher interest rates on deposits compared with rates offered by competing institutions, along with special income tax concessions1 have helped the Bank in mobilising deposits. The savings promotion campaign conducted by the Bank and the expansion programme involving the opening of new branches (the Bank had opened 19 branches by the end of 1974) have also helped in no small measure its efforts to mobilise deposits. Apart from the increase in its deposits the increased income now available to the Bank as a result of the higher rate of interest to be earned on its recent investments, has also enhanced its supply of investable funds. Finally, as in the previous year, a Treasury grant of Rs. 20 million given to compensate the Bank on account of the Bank's low income yielding securities relating to the past investments of savings institutions which the Bank inherited, has also been re-invested in new rupee securities.",

The increased contributions from this source has been largely the result of the increased volume of borrowings by the government in the recent past, which has increased in turn the volume of sinking funds available for investment. Further, the higher interest yield of 9 per cent on investment in rupee securities together with the fact that redemptions of loans were comparatively few in recent years have also enhanced the investment capacity of the sinking funds in 1974.",

    "text": "The Employees' Provident Fund was the third largest contributor to rupee securities in 1974. Although there was a marginal increase in the contributions to rupee securities over that of the previous financial year, its relative share has declined from 25 per cent in 1973 to 22 per cent in 1974. The average rate of monthly investment by the Fund in rupee securities during 1974 was in the range of Rs. 16 million per month, which is slightly above the monthly average attained in 1973. The availability of funds with the Employees' Provident Fund for investment in rupee securities is basically determined by two factors, namely its excess of income over expenditure and the contributions received during the year. The former is deter\u00admined in turn by the level of employment and wages and by the efficiency of the enforcement machinery of the Department of Labour. In regard to the latter, the primary factor has been the refunds made from the fund. In the last few years, refunds made from the Fund in respect of the contributions of Indian repatriates under the Sirima-Shastri pact have resulted in a more than average outflow from the",

During the previous financial year utilisation of project loans and non-project (commodity) loans amounted to Rs. 153 million (or 44 percent) and Rs. 194 million (or 56 per cent) respectively. It is to be observed that utilisation of project loans has been very low whereas there has been a substantial increase in the utilisation of non-project (commodity) loans during the financial year under review in contrast to the situation that prevailed in the financial year 1973.",

    "text": "During the last nine years with the only exception of the year 1973, the actual receipts of foreign aid, project aid in particular, have consistently fallen short of the expected amounts. Any shortfall in project aid while directly reducing the capital expenditure of the government during the year also results in a reduction in the local expenditure of a capital nature associated with the project. Shortfalls in commodity aid, too, could by affecting the supply of available investment goods adversely affect the level of investment of both the public and private sectors. Such a situation undoubtedly has a direct impact on the extent of under expenditure in relation to originally budgeted estimates for investment by the government. As has been repeatedly stressed in the annual reports of the past, a more accurate forcasting of potential receipts of foreign finance is not merely important from the point of view of financing the budgetary needs of the government but also from the point of view of its significance for the amount of public sector investment.",

Domestic non-bank market borrowings through rupee loans and administrative borrowings are expected to bring in Rs. 657 million and Rs. 73 million respectively. Together these three sources of finance are expected to cover the entire deficit, thus eliminating the need for bank borrowing. It is to be observed that the Budget for 1975 relies heavily on external borrowings both for direct finance as well as for additional local revenue. Foreign aid has thus become a crucial element not merely on the balance of payments front but also in the budgetary field.",

Thus, the Finance Minister stated that the profits from trade, business, profession or vocation, rent and interest assessable for the year of assessment 1975/76 will be either the profits of the calender year 1975 or the profits for the year ending on 31st March 1975, whichever is the higher.

Companies which are approved and gazetted prior to 1st January 1976, will enjoy the tax holidays on export profits for the full period of five years or eight years specified in the law. Moreover, the allowance for approved investments under Section I6cc of the Inland Revenue Act will be granted only where the investment is made and ordinary shares in the approved companies are allotted on or before 31st December, 1975. Further relief will be provided only for invest\u00adments in approved broad-based companies. He added that the format for broad-based companies is presently being worked out and that he intended setting up initially a few model broad-based companies, some of which would be in the gem industry.",
