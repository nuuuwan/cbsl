The increase in output in the agriculture sector, because of its relative importance in the Gross National Product, exerts a large influence on overall economic growth.

    "text": "The increase in the output of the agriculture sector, reflects mainly the increase in the production of paddy and subsidiary food crops, which was substantially higher than in 1973. In plantation agriculture, tea and rubber production was lower than in 1973, while coconut production is estimated to have increased marginally above the 1973 level. The increase in output in the construction sector was due chiefly to the improved supply position of building materials. The share of the public sector in the increase in output of the construction sector was higher than in 1973. The output of the manufacturing sector, fell by 4.1 per cent in 1974 due mainly to the fall in the output of factory industry, and the fall in real value added in the processing of plantation crops. The increase in production in agriculture and construction exerted an upward influence on the level of economic activity in the services sector. The value of output in the services sector increased by 5.3 per cent in 1974. Of this increase transport and trade contributed Rs. 102 million or 4.2 per cent. A significant feature of changes in the sectoral composition of Real Gross National Product in recent years has been the relative decline in the con\u00adtribution of the agriculture sector. The share of agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing has declined from an average of 39 per cent in the years 1959 to 1970 to an average of 33.7 per cent in the years from 1971 to 1974. This is partly because the fall in production in the plantation sector has dampened the overall rate of growth of output in the agriculture sector and on account of the fact that the out\u00adput of the agriculture sector has been increasing in absolute terms. It is also evident that the fall in the share of agriculture in total Gross National Product has also been due to the higher rate of increase in the growth of the other sectors.",

In 1974, the import price index increased by 17.7 per cent while the export price index increased by 15.5 per cent. As a result the terms of trade deteriorated by 10.7 per cent in 1974 compared with 13.3 per cent in 1973. In consequence, real Gross National Product adjusted for changes in the terms of trade (Real National Income) increased by 4.1 per cent compared with the increase of 1.7 per cent in 1973. Gross National Product at current factor cost prices is estimated to have increased by 30 per cent in 1974, compared with the increase of 20 per cent in 1973.",

Total resources available to the economy consisting of domestic production and imports at market prices amounted to Rs. 26,394 million compared with Rs. 19,592 million in 1973. The increase in total resources was made up of an increase of Rs. 4,840 million in the Gross National Product and an increase of Rs. 1,962 million in imports. The weight of imports in total resources increased from 14.6 per cent in 1973 to 18 per cent in 1974 reflecting the increase in import prices between 1973 and 1974. The real increase in resources in 1974 came solely from the increase in domestic production; real imports as measured by the Central Bank's index of import volumes having fallen by 29.1 per cent in 1974,",

The reduction in the imports of investment goods was reflected in the fall in fixed capital formation in plant and machinery and the marginal increase in fixed capital formation in transport equipment. Fixed capital formation in building and other construction recorded a high rate of increase of 29.6 per cent in 1974 compared with 11.0 per cent in 1973.",
