Even though the end year figure for 1974 shows a modest rate of increase of 6.0 per cent, the monthly average level ofthe money supply was 18.1 per cent above the corresponding level for 1973. The money supply expansion in 1974 as against 1973 shows a relatively lower rate of growth because the comparison has been made with an unusually high level of the money supply at the end of 1973. In addition to this the money supply declined substantially towards the end of 1974.",

    "text": "Table II (E) I shows the level of money supply on a monthly basis during the period 1970\u201474. It could be observed that 1974 was characterized by a substantial rise in the monthly rates of increase in the money supply. The money supply rose very rapidly in the first quarter of the year particularly in March when it increased by as much as Rs. 224.9 million or by 25.7 percent compared to the same month in the previous year. This was the largest increase for any one month in 1974 and was mainly due to heavy government borrowing from the Central Bank, govern\u00adment corporations having increasing recourse to commercial bank credit, and by commercial bank financing of purchases under the Guaranteed Price Scheme which reaches a peak normally in June of each year. During April, the money supply fell by Rs. 137 million which was the largest monthly decline during the year. In the second quater the rate of the money supply expansion was lower as compared to the first quarter but the absolute level was higher than at the same time in the previous year. The expansion in the money supply in the third quarter although lower than in the first quarter, was higher than the expansion in the second quater. In September the money supply reached the highest level for the year and was due to a rise in net external banking assets and a fall in government cash balances. In the final quarter, with a rapid fall in net external assets of the banking system and a reduction in govern\u00adment borrowings from the banking system, the money supply fell substantially and in December 1974 was 6.0 per cent above the level in December 1973.",

    "text": "The pattern of fluctuation in the money supply in 1974 differed substantially from that of the previous year. In 1973 the money supply reached a very high level in June mainly due to the financing of paddy purchases under the Guaranteed Price Scheme. The money supply reached another peak in December of that year because of an increase in cultivation loans to farmers from commercial banks and a rise in government borrowing from the banking system. The variation in the money supply in 1974 was not due to seasonal factors like the increase in agricultural credit during the Maha season but to the non-seasonal credit needs of government corporations and other private sector customers. It has been already indicated that the rapid increase in the money supply in March was due largely to the increased credit granted to the corporations and the government. As against this, due to the slower rate of purchases by the Food Commissioner's Department which had to use its go-downs to stock imported rice, the seasonal decline in the volume of credit",

In fact, the operations of the government sector contributed significantly to the decline in the level of the money supply in the last quarter. The changes in the net external assets of the banking system were [also important in determining the movements of money supply in 1974. In the first quarter, the fall in net external assets tended to dampen the expansionary effects of domestic credit creation, while in the last quarter this factor reinforced the contraction in credit. In the second and third quarters, the impact of the changes in external assets on the money supply was not significant. Yet, another factor that tended to influence the level of money supply in 1974 as compared to 1973 was the ceiling on domestic credit that came into effect in May 1974.",

Within the private sector the principal cause of the monetary expansion was the unprecedented level of borrowings by government corporations which increased by Rs. 641.5 million. However, the rise in their holdings of time and savings deposits by Rs. 21.1 million with the banks marginally reduced the net expansion to Rs. 620.4 million. In 1973 the operations of government corporations brought about a contraction of Rs. 134.8 million. Substantial increases in the prices of imports of corporations, the financing of large stocks of raw materials and the need to finance operating losses of some corporations were responsible for this phenomenal increase in bank credit to them.",

    "text": "A disappointing feature of the change in primary liquid assets however, is that over 60 per cent of the increase took place in the form of notes and coins held by the public. Consequently, the currency component in primary liquidity increased to 52.3 per cent while demand deposits declined correspondingly (Table II (E) 4) The growing public preference for currency relative to demand deposits that prevailed for a number of years in the past was checked with the demonetization exercise of 1970. Since then however, the trend has re-emerged with the exception of 1972. This situation is disconcerting also for the reason that the number of branch offices of commercial banks providing current account facilities have more than doubled from 204 in 1972 to 457 in 1974. Apart from the usual factors influencing the public preference for currency, the Bank Debits Tax and the prevalent inflationary situation may have accelerated this tendency.",

This reveals that the branch expansion of commercial banks as well as the National Savings Bank has been successful in mobilising increased savings although the former has not led to a similar increase in demand deposits. It may also be noted that time and savings deposits at the National Savings Bank carry higher interest rates while interest earnings on time and savings deposits are exempt from income tax upto Rs. 1,000 per annum per individual to a limit of six individuals per family.",

The increase took place on account of rise in demand deposits as well as time and savings deposits. The latter had declined in 1973. These were supplemented by a similar increase in other liabilities which too had declined during the earlier year. Resources generated within the banking system mainly through increase in paid up capital reserve fund and undistributed profits increased during the year. Nevertheless the demand for creait from commercial banks have reached such proportions during the year that these enhanced resources were unable to meet the entire requirements. The banks, therefore, had to rely increasingly on borrowings from the Central Bank to meet the resource gap.",

The resources available to commercial banks were further enhanced by incurring other liabilities amounting to Rs. 277.9 million.

As against this, the demand for credit from the government sector declined to an insignificant level of Rs. 0.3 million which resulted in a net inflow of funds to the commercial banks totalling Rs. 197.7 million. However, the largest volume of funds was provided by the Central Bank amounting to Rs. 449.5 million almost entirely in the form of Central Bank accommodation. The volume of deposits with the commercial banks, which largely determined the scale of bank lending, grew at a modest rate compared with the sharp rise in the credit needs. Thus the banks were forced to draw heavily from the Central Bank while at the same time reducing their holdings of liquid assets such as Treasury bills.",

The principal among these were the increased prices of their imports, the tendency to build up stocks and the financing of current operating losses of some of the corporations. Although credit needs of other private sector customers also increased owing to the higher price of imports, the extent of their bank borrowing was of a lower order than that of the corporations. The increase in bank credit to co-operatives was mainly for the financing of purchases under the Guaranteed Price Scheme and for cultivation loans. The enhanced guaranteed price of paddy",

In the case of cultivation loans, the raising of the limits for these loans by commodities, extending the coverage of crops for which loans are granted and the inclusion of those who were earlier ineligible for loans on account of defaults contributed to the increase in this type of credit.

    "text": "The factors that operated to increase the demand for credit by the private sector is well reflected in each category of advances. For instance the increase in cash items in the process of collection was mainly due to the increased credit needs to finance purchases under the Guaranteed Price Scheme. Although the volume of purchases of paddy by the Paddy Marketing Board was lower in 1974, the higher purchase price accounted for the increased demand for advances for this purpose. The value of import bills held by banks increased by Rs. 73.7 million and this entire increase was on account of imports by government corporations. The value of export bills held by the banks increased by Rs. 101.8 million during the year. As indicated earlier, higher prices for Sri Lanka's exports in 1974 and the extension of the period of encashment of these bills accounted for this increase. As in the previous year a further reason for the high value of export bills was the high discount rate that prevailed abroad which discouraged the commercial banks from converting these assets into cash and balances held abroad.",

In all these changes the British banks recorded a corresponding decline in their deposit holdings while the Indian and Pakistani banks continued to maintain their share The rapid expansion in the Sri Lanka banks in 1974 is the main reason for the sharp increase in their deposits. The reduction in the number of offices of the British banks\u2014where two offices of the Mercantile Bank were taken over by the Hatton National Bank\u2014is largely responsible for the fall in the share of deposits held by them.",

The Central Bank's provisional advances to the government also contributed to the growth in domestic assets. But this amounted to Rs. 39.1 million which was marginally above the increase that took place in 1973. Besides provisional advances, government and government guaranteed securities also rose by Rs. 55.6 million. An otherwise sharp expansion in the assets from these three factors was moderated to some extent by the decline in other domestic assets and accounts amounting to Rs. 75.4 million. It was further reduced by the decline in the international reserve of the Central Bank by Rs. 60.4 million. As in the past, the change in the cash and balances abroad accounted for the entire decline in the international reserve while holdings of Special Drawing Rights increased by Rs. 6.1 million to Rs. 86.0 million. The higher level of holdings of SDR's arose from the need to meet the reconstitution reqirements as laid down by the International Monetary Fund where 30 per cent of daily average allocation of SDR's has to be maintained unused and partly, from the change in the exchange value of the Sri Lanka Rupee arising from frequent realignments that took place during 1974.",

The main contributory factor for the rise in deposits was the net increase in drawings from the International Monetary Fund which accounted for Rs. 164.2 million of the increase. These were mostly drawings under the newly established 'Oil Facility'.. Apart from the increase in deposits of international organisations and foreign govern\u00adments totalling Rs. 201.6 million the deposits of the government and those classified under the 'Other' category increased by Rs. 40.0 million. On the other hand the change in the volume of deposits held by the commercial banks and government agencies and institutions together accounted for a decline of Rs. 78.2 million. The net result of all these changes was an increase in deposits held by the Central Bank amounting to Rs. 163.4 million. The currency issue of the Central Bank also increased by Rs. 176.0 million compared with Rs. 203.3 million in 1973. The rest of the expansion in liabilities is accounted for by the growth in other liabilities bylRs. 53\\o million, borrowings from abroad amounting to Rs. 16.7 million together with a Rs.

At the same time the need to restrict an excessive growth in credit and money supply was increasingly realised. The Central Bank accordingly imposed a ceiling on commercial bank credit on 24th May 1974. The banks were requested not to exceed their volume of lending over the level prevailing on 24 th May 1974 and not to lend for purposes other than for production needs and export financing.
