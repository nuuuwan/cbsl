These figures may differ from trade statistics based on Customs returns as Customs statistics reflect physical movements of commodities while exchange control statistics record the receipt/payment of money, and usually there is atime-lag between the two aspects.",

Thus, past data show that gross domestic capital formation has tended to move concurrently with the current account deficit. Up to 1969/70, when the current account deficit went on increasing, gross domestic capital formation,too, increased, and since then with the progressive decline in the deficit, the rate of capital formation also has steadily declined.

The higher earnings were the outcome of favourable prices for practically all export commodities.

    "text": "Despite the higher level of prices for nearly all tree crop products the response of output to prices was poor and output declined appreciably. In the commodity boom in 1973 tea prices remained depressed, but a significant rise in prices from early 1974 bought about a belated improvement in export earnings. Rubber benefited from the boom in primary commodities from the early part of 1973. Prices improved further in early 1974 in the immediate aftermath of the abrupt rise in oil prices in 1974. Although average rubber prices in 1974 as a whole were higher than in 1973, from mid-1974 onwards rubber prices have been declining steeply. In 1973 export volume responded to higher prices through intensive tapping; however, in 1974 production fell sharply. Despite the latter, higher average prices resulted intotal earnings from rubber increasing from Rs. 519 million in 1973 to Rs.746 million in 1974. The output of coconut in 1974 was a third below the high level reached in 1972. Consequently, the industry failed to benefit fully from the exceptionally",

The initial set-back to the surge in gem exports came in the aftermath of the abrupt rise in oil prices in early 1974 when demand from the industrially rich countries started to fall off. Although there were indications towards the middle oftheyearthat thegem export trade was overcoming these adverse effects, earnings again fell back in the last three months probably as recession in the Industrial West began to curtail economic activity. Over the year as a whole although the volume exported was maintained, lower prices resulted in a fall in total earnings.",

In the case of oil it is not easy to make such an accurate assessment because, apart from a small amount spent on imports of refined products, the bulk of the payment is for crude oil which is refined locally. A part of this is re-exported as fuel for foreign ships and aircraft, and another part as by-products, for example, Naphtha. Such re-exports were valued at Rs. 350 million in 1974. Determining the import cost of these items, i.e. the estimation of the crude oil content of such re\u00adexports, would require, the gross export value to be adjusted for domestic value added. Such an exercise is ruled out on technical grounds as crude oil does not lend itself wholly to producing one particular refined product without at the same time generating by-products in the refinery.",

The overall effects of the increase in oil prices on Sri Lanka's balance of payments are even greater, if account can be taken of its more indirect impact, that is, its effect on the cost structures of industrial countries, which have increased the cost to Sri Lanka of imports of manufactured goods and capital equipment, and on freight rates, which in turn have increased the c.i.f. cost of all imports.",

(The other reason being the receipt of grants.) This situation is changing and there are indications to this effect in 1974. To some extent this is because, the surplus in this account is likely to be moderated (i) by the increase in payments on account of passenger fares paid to foreign aircraft and ships as a result of residents using foreign craft for travel; one-third of the total payments (Rs. 23 million) was on this account in 1974, and (ii) by expanding operations of local shipping fleets which result in expenses being incurred by such locally owned vessels in foreign ports*. This item included under port expenditure (debit) has increased from Rs. 11 million in 1971 to Rs. 16 million in 1974. The other reason for the decline in the relative importance of this account in the balance of payments, is the growth of the tourist industry.",

Sri Lanka's distance from the main sources of tourist traffic (North America, Western Europe and Japan) and considering the rise in transport costs is likely to affect the numbers coming from these countries. This is occurring at a time when the capacity is being expanded substantially, and can place Sri Lanka's tourist industry in a difficult situation.",

From a level of Rs. 52 million in 1969, the profits/dividend remittances abroad have dwindled to Rs. 14 million in 1974 while interest payments on foreign debt in the same period have risen sharply from Rs. 68 million to Rs. 134 million.

In 1971 the share of the current account deficit financed by net long-term capital was 186 per cent; in 1972 and 1973, 148 per cent and 120 per cent respectively. External assets steadily increased from Rs. 403 million in 1971 to Rs. 851 million in 1973. It is true that some of the types of financing, such as excessive resort to short-term credits and foreign loans of short maturity, were not desirable, but on the other hand it can be argued that some of these credits helped to build up assets. The overall financing picture in the four year period 1970 to 1973 therefore is that the current account deficit was financed wholly through transactions in the non-monetary capital sector. This also meant that the net foreign exchange assets position of the country, which is determined by monetary movements and defined as the difference between the foreign assets of the Central Bank, commercial banks and the government on .one hand, and on the other the foreign liabilities of the Central Bank, commercial banks and the government*, improved from\u2014Rs. 726 million in l969to-f-Rs. 36.7 million in December 1973l.",

    "text": "Assistance from the I.M.F. came very largely through the Oil Facility set up on' 13 June, 1974. Under this Facility, the I.M.F. decided to make resources available to member countries to assist them to meet the adverse affect on their balance of payments of increases in the cost of oil imports. In drawing on this Facility, Sri Lanka along with others seeking assistance, undertook to (a) cooperate with the I.M.F. to find appropriate solutions for her balance of payments problems, and (b) in managing its international payments, to avoid adopting policies which would aggravate the balance of payments problems of other countries. Through two drawings during 1974, an aggregate amount of Rs. 271 million (SDR 34 million) was available for balance of payments support. As the I.M.F. itself had to borrow from, oil exporting countries the funds to finance this Facility, the interest rate is 7 per cent per annum, which is higher than the 4 to 6 per cent per annum levied on other drawings. Other drawings from the I.M.F. came through the Standby Arrangement negotiated in the early part of the year.",

The balance in Sri Lanka/China account after being in Sri Lanka's favour in 1971/72 has since then turned against because the value of rice imports has out\u00adstripped the value of rubber exports.

Directly this consisted of a cash loan of US $21 million (Rs. 137 million) from the monetary authority of Kuwait to the Central Bank repayable in 2 years. While the scale of support from this source can increase in importance in the next year or two as the number of participating countries increase, it must be realised that limits are bound to be reached in the capacity of these countries to give further credit. On the one hand with the rapid development programmes now under way in those countries, and on the other the operation of oil conservation measures and the search for additional sources of oil and substitutes by consuming countries is bound to reduce the amount of surplus oil funds. The importance of keeping the balance of payments deficit to proportions dictated by available resources thus cannot be over-emphasised.",

    "text": "The debt service ratio, which is the proportion of foreign exchange earnings on current account absorbed by the external service payments, is commonly used to assess a country's debt burden. Generally, a rising ratio would indicate an increasing burden and greater short-term rigidity in the balance of payments, while a falling ratio will have the opposite effect. In Sri Lanka's case the debt service ratio after reaching 23.0 per cent in 1973 fell back in 1974 to I7.9percent. That this happened when total service payment has been higher than ever, is entirely because of the substantially higher earnings in 1974. For the servicing problem to be manageable, as implied by a lowering of the debt service ratio, continuing gains on the earnings front, will be needed.",

Partly this has been due to the lower overall export earnings from the sale of gems and partly because other items involved in the scheme enjoyed better prospects. The rate changes proposed in the Budget, downwards for gems and upwards for others, are likely to further reduce the bias towards more earnings from gems being credited to these accounts.",

Based on data on import licences issued, the bulk of payments for imports has been for trade quota items (48 per cent) and industrial raw materials (28 per cent). Convertible rupees utilized for the importation of motor vehicles and other direct-user items amounted to 12 per cent and II per cent respectively of the total licences issued. It is thus seen that the bulk of the convertible rupee funds arising from the scheme has been used to promote industry rather than to cater directly to personal consumption.",
