I. Land Reform

Under the Land Reform Law of 1972 privately owned agricultural land above a ceiling of 50 acres (except in the case of paddy where the ceiling was 25 acres) was deemed vested in the Land Reform Commission. Such statutorily vested lands had to be alienated within a maximum period of two years, (i. e. by August 26, 1974), unless special approval was obtained from the Minister of Agriculture and Lands.

By August 26, 1974 all expropriated land was divested from the previous owners and alienated to various organizations and individuals.

The total extent of land acquired by the Land Reform Commission under the Land Reform Law of 1972 was 559,377 acres. The breakdown ofthe area vested in the Commission by type of land use is given in Table II (B) I.

As can be seen from this table nearly one third of lands vested in the Land Reform Commission is uncultivated land. Tea lands constitute nearly one fourth the total lands vested and over a fifth of the land area under tea. A fifth of the area vested was coconut land but this constitutes only 10 per cent of the area under coconut. The extent of rubber land vested constitutes about 15 per cent of both the total area vested and the total area under rubber. Although the cardamom area vested is small it constitutes probably as much as 70 per cent of the country's cardamom cultivation.

The institution or management-wise redistribution of these lands is given in Table II (B) 2. However, lands that have been alienated could be revested in the Land Reform Commission when such lands have not been utilised in accordance with the terms and conditions under which such lands were alienated [Land Reform Law,

( 37 )

Section 24 (2) ] . Further, lands given to particular organisations may be given to other organisations subsequently. Therefore, figures in Table II (B) 2 are not necessarily the final position and are not indicative of the ultimate form of management of these lands.

2. Agricultural Production

(a) Paddy Production in 1974

Statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics indicate a sharp rise in paddy production in 1974 compared to the preceding year. Paddy output increased by about 22 per cent from 62.90 million bushels in 1973 to 76.80 million bushels in 1974.

This increase was achieved mainly owing to an increase in the area cultivated.

The area under paddy cultivation in 1974 (net extent harvested) increased by as much

as 19 per cent over the 1973 extent. The increment in the net extent harvested was

partly due to a lower incidence of crop failure during the year; only 3.85 per cent

of the sown area was not harvested during the year. The increment in yield per

acre in 1974 was relatively small—only 1.08 bushels per acre or 2.42 per cent over

that of 1973. The extents under improved varieties have increased in all districts

for which data are available.

( 38 )

There were significant increases in both fertilizer issues and credit during 1974. Fertilizer issues increased from 96,816 tons in 1972/73 to 115,702 tons in 1973/74. Credit given for paddy production Under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme increased from Rs. 28.3 million in 1972/73 to Rs. 109.0 million in 1973/74. This constitutes a 285 per cent increase in credit disbursed which reflects an increase in the cost of production and alsothe removal of the provision denying credit to defaulters. The total amount of credit given in 1973/74 was the highest amount disbursed for paddy cultivation so far.

While the total paddy output for 1974 is the highest since 1970, it was slightly less than that of 1970. The yield per acre in 1974 was significantly less than in the cultivation seasons in 1970. While the yields per acre in Maha 1973/74 and Yala 1974 were 47.72 bushels and 41.74 bushels respectively, the yields per acre in Maha 1969/70and Yala I970were 52.21 and 44.59 bushels per acre respectively. In other words, the paddy output in 1974 nearly reached the level attained in 1970 owing to a significant expansion in the area cultivated.

The performance of the paddy sector is analysed by the two seasons Maha 1973/74 and Yala 1974 in the following sections. The data for these two seasons are given in Table II (B) 3.

Maha 1973174: According to statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics, the total paddy production in Maha 1973/74 was 52.6 million bushels. This is an increase of 25 percent overthe 1972/73 Maha crop and the highest total production for a Maha crop. This increase was achieved by both an expansion in the area under cultivation and an increase in yield per acre.

The gross extent sown increased from 1.18 million acres in Maha 1972/73 to 1.32 million acres in Maha 1973/74, while the gross extent harvested increased from 1.09 to 1.29 million acres in the respective seasons. The sown extent not harvested

was 29,476 acres or 2.24 per cent of the sown extent indicating a low level of crop failure.

The average yield per net acre harvested also increased from 45.54 bushels in Maha 1972/73 to 47.7 bushels in Maha 1973/74. There was a substantial increase in inputs for the Maha crop. Credit given for paddy cultivation Under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme increased more than three-fold from Rs20.3 million in Maha 1972/73 to Rs. 84.2 million in Maha 1973/74. Fertilizer issued increased by 22,995 tons or 41 per cent over the previous Maha. The fertilizer issued per acre of harvested paddy land in Maha 1973/74 was 137.5 lbs. compared to 115.8 lbs. in the previous Maha. Incomplete data indicate that the extent under improved varieties increased.

Yala 1974: According to the Department of Census and Statistics total paddy production in Yala 1974 was 24.2 million bushels. This constitutes an increase of 15.6 per cent over paddy production in Yala 1973, but does not surpass Yala production

In 1970 and 1971 (28.0 and 25.3 million bushels respectively).

The factors responsible for the increase in output in Yala 1974 include a 17.5 per cent increase in the gross extent sown and an 18.5 per cent increase in the gross extent harvested from that of Yala 1973. The difference in percentages of the sown

and harvested extents is indicative of less crop failure in Yala 1974 compared to Yala 1973. The sown extent not harvested was 5.43 per cent of the total area sown. Incomplete data indicate an increase in the area under improved seed varieties. Credit disbursed Under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme increased by 210 per cent from Rs. 8.0 million in Yala 1973 to Rs 24.8 million in Yala 1974. Fertilizer issued in Yala 1974 was 36,627 tons compared to 40,736 tons in Yala 1973 The fertilizer issued per acre of harvested paddy land in Yala 1974 was 1199 lbs compared to 158-8 lbs in the previous Yala.

Paddy Purchases Under the Guaranteed Price Scheme

Despite the good paddy production performance indicated in the statistics of the Department of Census and Statistics, paddy purchases by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) under the Guaranteed Price Scheme (GPS) were below expectations. Although the PMB has monopoly purchasing rights for paddy and considerable restrictions apply to the transportation of paddy, only 27 per cent of the 1974 production was purchased by the PMB. This is even smaller than last year's purchases which accounted for 36 per cent of total paddy production. The PMB took over the functions of purchasing paddy from the Department of Agrarian Services in January 1972, but both organisations purchased paddy till April 1972, when the PMB alone took over the responsibility. Paddy purchases, have declined since 1970/71 both in the total quantity purchased and as a proportion, of total production. This can be seen in Table II (B) 4.

In the cultivation year 1973/74 the acreage under fifteen subsidiary food crops (excluding meneri and thanahal for which complete data are not available) listed in the table was 603,432 compared to 406,448 in the cultivation year 1972/73. The extent under manioc, chillies, maize, kurakkan, gingelly and green gram was 549,839 acres representing 91.1 per cent of the total acreage under the listed fifteen crops in 1973/74. The production of manioc, maize, red onions and green gram hat increased in 1973/74 compared to 1972/73.

Changes in 1974

During the course of the year, 390 Agricultural Productivity Committees were established bringing the total number of such committees to 473. It is envisaged that 480 committees would be ultimately established. During 1974, 125 Agricultural Service Centres were opened bringing the total number of such centres to 208.

The guaranteed price per bushel of paddy was increased from Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 in March and to Rs. 33 in July I 974.

(b) Subsidiary Food Crops

The performance of the subsidiary food crop sector for the cultivation years 1972/73 and 1973/74 is given in table II (B) 6.

( 43 )

There were two changes in the fertilizer subsidy for paddy during the year. In July there was a fourfold increase in the average cost of the recommended dosage of fertilizer from about Rs. 50 to Rs. 250. This was subsequently reduced to about

Rs. 160 per recommended dosage. The final cost was 220 per cent more than the cost before July 1974. However, these price increases did not affect the cultivation seasons in 1974 reviewed in the report. The price increase is likely to affect fertilizer use in Maha 1974/75. But it will be difficult to determine the impact of the fertilizer price increase alone, as drought conditions have been an important factor in the Dry zone.

The Agricultural Insurance Scheme which was expected to be implemented throughout the country in Maha 1974/75 was postponed owing to the drought. This scheme is expected to be implemented from Yala 1975.

3. Rural Banking and Credit

In 1974, institutional credit to the rural sector was channelled primarily through the New Agricultural Credit Scheme, the cooperative rural banks and the Bank of Ceylon sub-offices at Agricultural Sevice Centres. The cooperative rural banks and the Bank of Ceylon sub-offices operated the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme introduced in 1973. In areas where these institutions have not been established or have not begun implementing the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme, the People's Bank continued to channel cultivation loans through the multipurpose cooperative societies as in the past. The loans disbursed under all these schemes during the year amounted to Rs. 136.5 million. In addition, credit to the rural sector was provided by schemes operated by government departments for specific purposes, by commercial banks and by specialized credit institutions.

The Central Bank operates a governmentguarantee scheme for cultivation loans for specified crops granted under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme and Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme to the extent of 75 per cent of the amount in default.

(i) N e w Agricultural Credit Scheme

The People's Bank operated the New Agricultural Credit Scheme of 1967 in areas where cooperative rural banks have not yet been established or where these banks have not commenced implementing the Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme of 1973. These loans were channelled through the multipurpose cooperative societies. Due to rising costs of production the credit limits that were in operation under this scheme until the end of Yala 1974, were increased with effect from 23rd September I974.1

As in the past the New Agricultural Credit Scheme was the main source of institutional credit for domestic agriculture. Out of a total sum of Rs. 116.1 million given for paddy and subsidiary crops during the year Rs, 109.3 million were given under this Scheme.

The loan disbursements in Maha 1973/74 show a sharp reversal of the declining trend of loan utilization under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme. The total amount granted during that season was Rs. 84.2 million which represents a substantial increase (314.8 per cent) over the amount granted in Maha 72/73. This high level of credit disbursement is primarily attributable to the upward revision of credit limits in 1973, the defaulting borrowers becoming eligible to receive credit and the increase in the number of borrowers due to the emphasis on food production. Loans granted for paddy cultivation in Yala 1974 increased by 210.0 per cent over the amount granted in the previous Yala season. The total credit utilization in the 1973/74 cultivation year was Rs. 109.0 million, the highest level of credit utilization in any cultivation year since the inception of the scheme in 1967.

The incomplete data for Maha 1974/75 show that Rs. 42.4 million have been

granted for paddy cultivation which is about half the total credit disbursed in the

previous Maha season.

With regard to loan repayments 42.9 per cent of the Maha 1973/74 loans were repaid compared to 62.1 per cent in Maha 1972/73. This is the lowest recovery figure recorded for any Maha season since the inception of the New Agricultural Credit Scheme and represents a very poor performance considering the recorded level of paddy production in Maha 73/74 as reported by the Department of Census

and Statistics and also the low incidence of crop failure during that season. The low level of paddy purchases by the PMB in Maha 1973/74 may perhaps explain this poor recovery rate. The loan recovery rate of 41.9 per cent in Yala 1974 does not indicate the final position as the figures are incomplete.

The district-wise breakdown of details regarding paddy loans in Maha 1973/74

and Yala 1974 are given in table in appendix 63.

The highest loan disbursement in the cultivation year 1973/74 was recorded in the Amparai district where disbursements amounted to Rs. 17.1 million and constituted 15.7 per cent of total loans. Ratnapura district recorded the highest recovery rate

(88.3 per cent) in Maha 1973/74.

(b) Loans for subsidiary Food Crops, Sugar Cane and Cotton

Details of loans disbursed for subsidiary food crops, sugar cane and cotton are presented in table II (B) 8. Of the loans granted for these crops the largest amount

(Rs. 10.8 million) was granted for chillies which constituted 43.1 per cent of total loans granted for all crops. In 1973/74 the New Agricultural Credit Scheme was expanded to cover sugar cane and cotton and cultivation loans were granted for these two crops for the first time in 1973/74. The loan disbursements for subsidiary food crops, sugar cane and cotton incresaed by 138.2 per cent over the amount disbursed in the previous year. The incomplete data on disbursements for 1974/75 cultivation year indicate a decline in disbursements for these crops compared to the

end year position in the previous cultivation year. This decrease may be due to the delay in commencement of the cultivation year as a result of the drought conditions that prevailed in the dry zone.

N e w Agricultural Credit Scheme—Loans for Subsidiary Food Crops, Sugar Cane and Cotton.

( 48 )

Of the loans disbursed in the 1972/73 cultivation year 60.6 per cent were recovered which is 11.7 per cent below the rate of recovery in the previous year. The percentage of loans recovered in 1973/74 does not indicate the actual rate of recovery due to the incomplete nature of the data.

The districtwise breakdown of loans for subsidiary food crops, sugar cane and cotton is presented in table 64 in appendix. As in the previous year a larger portion of the total loans for chillies {41.5 per cent) and onions (66.6 per cent) went to the Jaffna district. Badulla district has utilized the highest share of the total loans for potatoes (70.5 per cent) and sugar cane (91.5 per cent) while the cultivation loans for cotton under the credit scheme have been granted only in the Hambantota district.

(ii) Rural Banks

The deposits and advances of the rural banks are presented in table II (B) 9. The number of rural banks at the end of 1974 was 332, which is fewer than the number at the end of 1973. This difference is due to the amalgamation of some rural banks

as a result of the reorganization of multipuropse cooperative societies. There are also 71 offices affiliated to 50 rural banks and functioning as special rural banks.

As shown in table II (B) 9 the total savings deposits of the rural banks amounted to Rs. 62.7 million at the end of 1974 representing an increase of 38.7 per cent over the savings deposits in the previous year. The total of loans outstanding at the end of 1974 was Rs. 29.0 million thus showing a net deposit position of Rs. 33.5 million which is a slight improvement over the net deposit position in the previous year. The average net deposit for all rural banks amounts to Rs. 100,985 per bank. Credit granted under pawn broking increased continously during 1974 and the end of year outstanding increased by 69.2 per cent over the previous year. As a result of the increased levels of lending under short term loans and pawning, the positive net deposit position (difference between total depostis and total advances) of rural banks observed in 1973 has transformed into a negative position in 1974.

The purpose wise breakdown of the loans disbursed by rural banks is given in table II (B) 10. Loans for production have increased by 36.6 per cent and for consumption1 by 94.4 per cent over the amount disbursed in the previous year.

The data on the district-wise classification of deposits and advances of rural banks are presented in table 65 in appendix. A positive net deposit position is observed in only 6 districts in 1974 compared to 20 districts in the previous year. As in 1973 rural banks in the Ratnapura district have the largest net deposits; rural banks in the Jaffna district the largest negative net deposit position. The recorded net deposit position of rural banks in a majority of the districts has been negative in 1974. In relation to the previous year this is a set back in the performance of rural banks.

(iii) Bank of Ceylon Rural Credit Scheme

At the end of 1974 number of Bank of Ceylon Sub-offices operating at agricultural service centres was 202 compared to 79 at the end of the previous year.

Data on deposits and advances of the Bank of Ceylon sub-offices at the end of 1974 is given in table II (B) I I . The net deposit position (excluding current account balances) of these sub-offiecs at the end of 1974 was Rs. 2.7 million or Rs. 13,587 per sub-office. Theis is an increse over the net deposit position of Rs. 1.2 million observed at the end of 1973. When the current account balances are included the net deposit at the end of 1974 amounts to Rs. 13.5 million or Rs. 66,797 per sub-office constituting a substantial increase from Rs. 3.5 million at the end of the previous year.

The total amount of loans granted by Bank of Ceylon sub-offices in 1974 was

Rs. 7.6 million. As shown in table II (B) 12 the largest proportion of loans (44.8 per cent) was given for the purchase of machinery and equipment. These loans have increased substantially from Rs 39, 720 at the end of 1973 to Rs 3.4 million at the end of 1974. Loans for production constituted 42.9 per cent of total loans granted in 1974, of which the bulk has been for paddy cultivation. A slight change in the total loan structure for 1974 is observed compared to that of 1973. In 1974 the proportion of loans granted for agricultural production and purchase of machinery and equipment alone accounted for 87.7 per cent of the total loans.

The district-wise position of the sub-offices is given in table 66 in appendix. The sub-offices in the Anuradhapura district have recorded the largest amount of deposits (Rs 3.0 million) while the Badulla district has the highest balance (Rs 1,463) per deposit account. The largest amount of loans has been disbursed in the Anuradha­pura district and the highest balance per loan account (Rs 51,463) is recorded in the Mannar district.

Loans disbursed under the New Agricultural Credit Scheme accounted for 80.1 per cent of total loans channelled to the rural sector in 1974. The purpose-wise classification of loans show that the largest proportion (85.1 per cent) has been disbursed for crop cultivation.

As shown in table II (B) 14 the net deposit position is negative in all districts.

The largest negative net deposit figure is recorded in the Jaffna district.
