A sharp increase of Rs. 1,105 million took place in the value of imported intermediate goods as well. Higher payments on petroleum and fertilizer imports figure very largely in the import bill for intermediate goods. The increase in the import payments on goods other than foodstuffs and intermediate goods as compared to 1973 has been somewhat moderate.",

    "text": "The volume index for all exports declined by 13 per cent mainly on account of substantial shortfalls in exports of tea and rubber while the price index for exports rose from 137 in 1974 to 213 in 1974 mainly due to the general improvement in inter\u00adnational primary commodity prices. However, the rise in the export price index was inadequate to offset the rise in the price index for imports. As a result, the import capacity or rather the terms of trade declined further from 65 in 1973 to 58 in 1974. The sharp increase in prices of main food items such as rice, flour and sugar, other essential commodities like crude oil, fertilizer and some other inter\u00admediate and investment goods was largely instrumental in forcing the terms of trade down to such a low level.",

A concerted effort has been made to make such data available as early as possible. However, the Customs data, parti\u00adcularly the import figures, still need to be interpreted with care. In the first place, the value of imports actually cleared through the Customs differs considerably from their value as reported by the Customs. This is mainly due to the fact that while data are compiled from entries passed in a given month, some exports and imports so recorded could be effected in a different month, either before or after the entries have been made. Further, the data are either-over or under-recorded and the extent of such misreporting can be ascertained to some extent by reference to actual imports or exports effected by some trading agencies.",

Earnings from rubber increased in absolute terms but the share fell from 23 per cent to 21 per cent. The share of export earnings from coconut oil, copra, desiccated coconut and fresh nuts increased from 6 per cent in 1973 to II per cent in 1974 while other domestic exports mainly industrial and agricultural goods excluding gems rose sharply from 13 per cent to 24 per cent.",

The gross turnover of tea at the Colombo auctions increased from Rs. 807 million in 1973 to Rs. 1,180 million in 1974, an increase of Rs. 263 million. The net turnover was more important from the viewpoint of the local producer, and at Rs. 1,038 million in 1974 the net turnover showed an increase of Rs. 263 million over the previous year1. The difference between the net and gross turnover was the sum received as ad valorem sales tax by government.",

Further, it showed a reversal in the declining trend that has prevailed over the past seven years. Since there were no restrictions on shipments to the London auctions the attractive prices realised at the auctions was an inducement for local shippers to send those tea to the London auctions. As in the past the bulk of tea shipped to London auctions was high grown which increased from 27.9 million pounds in 1973 to 31.5 million pounds in 1974. In terms of the total consigned to the London auctions in 1974 the share of high growns was 61.8 per cent. While shipments of medium growns at 17.9 million pounds was 35.1 per cent, low grown tea constituted only 1.6 million pounds (or 3.1 per cent).",

Apart from the increase in the cost of production, estates and companies had to expend much of their working capital on the modernization of tea factories and replanting, which resulted in the continued exhaustion of their liquidity. Hence the Central Bank formulated a scheme in April to provide guarantees on behalf of the government of Sri Lanka to commercial banks in respect of loans granted by them for tea replanting and tea factory development. While the loans approved by the Loan Committee of the Central Bank came within the purview of this scheme, guarantees were applied only to 75 per cent of the principal found tobe irrevocable. In order to accommodate expenditure incurred earlier in this regard, the scheme came into being retrospectively",

Not only was this lower by 40 million pounds or 12 per cent compared with 1973 but it was also the lowest recorded since 1966. Despite an improvement in average annual prices, the setback to production in 1974 has been due to such factors as adverse weather conditions, increased costs of production and the reduced application of fertilizer. Adverse weather conditions reportedly hampered tapping operations and the latex intake was poor. High prices of fertilizer have led to a further reduction in the application of fertilizer from 14,470 tons in 1973 to 12,285 tons in 1974.",

However, this production figure still continued to be one of the lowest Sri Lanka has witnessed over many years. As mentioned in the previous Annual Report, the poor performance in coconut production in 1973 was attributed to factors, such as the prolonged drought, coupled with lower application of fertilizer, the coconut pest in certain areas and the disloca\u00adtion of production resulting from Land Reform. These effects especially the latter continued to be felt significantly in 1974 as well. Weather conditions in the coconut growing areas have been satisfactory in 1974 and it is therefore likely that production would go up in 1975.",

    "text": "The gains accruing to local shippers were the result of higher prices in the inter\u00adnational market resulting from the short supply situation. Towards the end of 1973 coconut oil again continued to enjoy a price premium over other oils and fats in the world market and this premium prevailed in the first three quarters of 1974 as well. For example, the average c.i.f. price of Philippine coconut oil for the U.K. market at \u00a3 200 in 1973 which showed an improvement of 144 per cent over the average in I'972 continued to rise further in the first quarter of the following year and averaged \u00a3 440 for the year, an increase of 120 per cent over 1973. The f.o.b. (Cdomboi)) price of Sri Lanka coconut oil advanced from \u00a3 370 per ton in December 1973 upto \u00a3 600'per ton in March 1974. Thereafter, the price fluctuated with a downward trend and fell considerably to a low level of \u00a3 294 per ton in December still registering an average of \u00a3 444 per ton for 1974. The fall in price towards the end1 of the year was due partly to the increased supplies from the Philippines and pa;Ftly.to the reduced, buying activity in major markets resulting from the recession.",

    "text": "The escalator! of general freight rates, bunker and port congestion surcharges and charges relating to the currency adjustment factor were major problems which Sri Lanka had to face in 1974. The escalation of freight rates on the one hand, eroded any gains in foreign exchange that would have accrued to Sri Lanka from the improve\u00adments in world commodity prices in 1974 and on the other hand, imposed a further burden on the steadily deteriorating balance of payments. For example, the Central Bank's Freight Rate Index for Sri Lanka's exports (1961 = 100) which showed only marginal increases in the major part of the sixties rose remarkably from 1970 onwards reflecting substantial increases in the individual indices for all major export commodi\u00adties. The overall freight index for these exports increased from 217.3 in 1973 to 234.9 percent in 1974.*",

The Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka, after studying the data provided by the shipping conferences and principals in support ofthe freight increases, was able to negotiate for lesser increases in respect of these conferences. The Bureau has requested the shipping conferences to give a minimum of 90 days notice of an increase in freight rates. The reasons given by the conference for increasing freight rates have been the escalation or continuing increase in operating costs and their inability to absorb losses.",

Many conferences effected large increases which generally ranged between 3.54 per cent and as high as 56 per cent.
