In practical terms, a properly computed price index would have given a more accurate indication of the severe inflationary pressures in 1974. Inflation was caused by very high prices for imported foodstuffs, other essential consumer goods and industrial raw materials. Although the end year increase in the money supply was far less significant than in the previous year, its increase alone is inadequate to explain why prices rose very sharply in 1974. Whereas the money supply rose by 6 per cent the rate of inflation shown by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index was 12.3 percent. The government Budget did not contribute to the inflation, its overall effect being contractionary.",

But despite this there was a marked decline in output in the plantation sector.

In sustaining the level of real per capita income the fall in the population growth rate has been the more important factor. The table above shows the significant decline in the rate of population growth since 1968. Since 1972 the population growth rate has dipped below 2 per cent and has not risen above this level . Recent surveys undertaken by the Central Bank show a very favourable response among the community to the present population control policies. Even making allowance for repatriation of Indian labour which have been about 35,000 per year since 1970 there are indications that the rate of population growth will continue to decline. The low growth rates of 1.8 and 1.6 per cent in 1973 and 1974 respectively are in part due to this factor. If these rates are adjusted for the emigration of Indian labour the actual rates as seen in table I\u20142 are higher.",

The latter rose from a monthly average of Rs. 1,158.6 million in 1972 to Rs. 1,601.4 million in 1973 and to Rs. 2,063.6 million in 1974. Similarly, there was also an increase in the rate of turnover of demand deposits from 2.17 in 1972 to 2.20 in 1973 and to 2.27 in 1974. Despite these indications, since cash transactions are still very important in the economy and as the larger volume of transactions do not flow through the banking system other indicators of inflation are the increase in currency notes and coins. The notes of larger denominations, particularly Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 notes increased sharply. It would appear that the issue of these notes increased not on account of the motivation to hoard money, but out of sheer necessity to meet the higher costs of goods and services. The five and ten rupee notes were no longer convenient means of payment for some transactions. Even Re I and 50 cents coins which had remained relatively stable in the preceding years rose substantially in 1974 because these had to take over transactions which used to be affected earlier by coins of lower denominations.",

Credit to the private sector as a whole, which includes government corporations, rose by Rs. 1,071.7 million as compared to the contraction of Rs. 22.6 million in 1973. Govern\u00adment corporations alone increased their borrowings by as much as Rs. 641.5 million during the year only to be offset by a negligible increase in their time and savings deposits of Rs. 21.1 million. Credit to private business concerns rose by Rs. 241.1 million mainly on account of the higher cost of imports. But this was largely offset by an equally large increase in private sector savings. The increase in bank credit to co-operatives was primarily to finance purchases of paddy and for cultivation loans. Moreover, the credit ceiling which was operative from 24th May 1974 prevented the flow of credit for non essential purposes. Apart from this the credit needs of private business concerns were lower because with their reduced foreign exchange alloca\u00adtions and high import prices they were able to obtain smaller amounts of raw materials. The high prices of final goods and increasing consumer resistance also limited the volume of sales. Furthermore, due to these and other uncertainties the business psychology in certain areas in the private sector was inimical to further investment. Many individuals and business concerns whose avenues of investment had dried up for these reasons found it advantageous to put their money in time and savings deposits in banks.",

Bank credit to government corporations reached an all time high and amounted to Rs. 1060.1 million at the end of 1974 which represents an increase of Rs. 641.5 million over the level in 1973. The largest borrowers were primarily those which were almost entirely dependent on imports. These details are given in table I\u20144. In some cases even though the physical volume of imported raw material and other products fell, increased credit requirements arose as a result of the sharp increase in import prices that took place in 1974. In the case of the Ceylon Fertilizer Cor\u00adporation its credit requirements increased by Rs. 256.2 million above the 1973 level because of the 400 per cent increase in the import prices of fertilizer following the very sharp increase in crude oil prices.

    "text": "at the end of 1974 was Rs. 288.7 million. To some extent this is an indication of the accumulation of fertilizer stocks due to the sharp fall in fertilizer issues for paddy cultivation. Similarly the increase in the price of cotton and yarn in international markets resulted in higher price being paid by the National Textile Corporation for its imports of cotton, pushing up the credit needs of the National Textile Corporation by Rs. 83.2 million and of the Weaving Supplies Corporation by Rs. 74.6 million in 1974. J n the case of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, which imports its entire requirements of crude oil, credit needs increased by Rs. 51.6 million partly because with the increase in price of crude oil credits extended by suppliers have been more restrictive and partly because the corporation was not able to fully recover its costs from the sale of some of its major products in the domestic market and because bunkers were less profitable. The State Trading Corporation dealing with textiles Salu Sala, also needed an additional Rs. 30.3 million by way of credit mainly because of the accumulation of stocks of locally produced textiles. Service corporations like the State Engineering Corporation, the State Trading Corporation (General) and the Ceylon Electricity Board had credits outstanding which exceeded Rs. 20 million in each case.",

As emphasised before, this was the outcome of an unprecedented increase in the expenditure on imports resulting purely from a phenomenal increase in commodity prices. Despite the fact that imports even of basic essentials were cut down to the barest minimum levels, yet the import bill could not be fully met out of current export earnings, and out of supplementary finance from traditional sources like assistance from the International Monetary Fund and countries in the aid consortium. In fact, the cuts imposed on consumer goods distributed to the public on ration have been the most severe and extensive in recent years. Per capita cereal consumption of rice and flour was at a low level. Allocations of sugar were cut to the bone. In 1973 when sugar was available off ration the country's imports were in the region of 193,000 tons; in 1974 the quantity was sharply reduced and total requirements are now confined to some 67,000 tons. The country would not have had the foreign exchange resources to maintain sugar imports anywhere near the former leveis in view of the phenomenally high price of sugar in world markets in 1974.",

As shown in table I\u20145 a good part of these short term credits are due to mature within the next year. In order to meet the repayment obligations the country must be in a position to rapidly generate adequate foreign exchange earnings. In the immediate future, Sri Lanka is going to be confronted with the situation of a further decline in the import capacity due to the fall in earnings from the main plantation crops other than tea. In the present circumstance the easiest way of increasing export earnings would be to increase output in the traditional export crops. There is no problem in selling more tea, rubber and coconut and it does not require export promotion and the elaborate infrastructure that is necessary to push non traditional goods in overseas export markets. Non traditional exports specially tourism and industrial goods, other than gems, are not likely to bring in substantial net foreign exchange earnings on account of the high import content of the products of such industries. Moreover, imports of foodstuffs, raw materials and other essential goods have now been drasti\u00adcally reduced and the scope for further curtailment of imports of these commodities do not seem to exist. Further inroads into the cereal content of the diet could impair the health of the population. Import capacity must be progressively increased to accommodate the import requirements of an increasing population. Apart from these considerations, in a situation of continuing inflation there is every reason to ensure that more goods are allowed to come in in order to stabilise prices. In the light of these issues the country would have to take measures to improve its export capacity in order to accommodate the increasing volume of external payments.",

Output increased by 22 per cent; rising from 62.9 million bushels in 1973 to 76.8 million bushels in 1974. A very large increase in the extent under cultivation, about 20 per cent and a lower incidence of crop failure contributed to increased output. In addition the issue of fertilizer for paddy cultivation increased by about 20 per cent while credit increased by 285 per cent due to the upward revision of credit ceilings on account of higher production costs. The level of paddy production in 1974 was the highest since 1970, but per acre yields fell very substantially from 51.21 bushels per acre in 1969/70 to 45.66 bushels in 1973/74.",

    "text": "This large increase in paddy output in 1974 should be appraised in terms of the sharp increase in the price of both paddy and rice in the producing districtsand on the supply, availability and the cost of ration and off ration (open market) rice. Data collected from recent Central Bank surveys show that the free market price of paddy and rice throughout 1974 has been at higher levels than at any time before. In the second half of 1974, while the guaranteed price of paddy was Rs. 33 per bushel, the free market price of paddy varied from Rs. 39 in the Batticaloa district toRs. 53 per bushel in the Colombo and Kalutara districts. The all island average was Rs. 49 per bushel. Similarly, the price of rice in the open market varied from Rs. 3.70 per measure in the Amparai and Hambantota districts to Rs. 7.25 in the Jaffna district. The all island average was Rs. 4.46 per measure. While domestic production rose very substantially on account of the higher guaranteed price, the cost of producton also rose sharply on acount of the high cost of inputs particularly fertilizer. When the 1974/75 Maha season commenced it was found that because of the high price of fertilizer as well as the drought farmers had considerably reduced the levels of application and fertilizer tended to pile up in the godowns of the Fertilizer Corporation.",

In February 1974, all transport or removal of paddy or rice without a permit was prohibited. Simultaneously stocks already held by producers were limited to quantities produced by them and all pro\u00adducers were required to confine sales of paddy or rice to the closest situated purchasing centre of the Paddy Marketing Board. These regulations were issued on account of the increasing divergence between the guaranteed price and the open market price which had provided an incentive for the increased flow of paddy into the \"illegal\" market.",

The re\u00adduced quantity of paddy purchased by the Board could have been partly due to the shrinkage in the marketable surplus of paddy due to increased family consumption. Survey data for two districts, Hambantota and Kandy, have shown that on an average between 37 and 48 per cent of the paddy produced is retained by the farmer for domestic consumption as well as seed material. However, since only about 27 per cent of the 1973/74 output appears to have been purchased by the Paddy Marketing Board, the question remains whether the farm family requirements have increased by 25 percentor even more in one year as a result of the reduced quantities available on the ration and the total reduced availability of cereals. The fact that only 27 per centof the 1974crop was purchased by the Boardinthefaceofabumperharvestneeds to be re-examined very carefully as against the previous year's purchases amounting to 36 per cent. Purchases by the Board have declined progressively since it was given the monopoly purchasing rights over paddy. The fall in the level of procure\u00adment is, therefore, hot confined to the year 1974 when exceptional circumstances have prevailed due to the reduction of the amount of rice given on the ration. At the same time.the very sharp increase inthe guaranteed price of paddy in July 1974 to Rs. 33 per bushel from Rs. 25 per bushel should have given the Board more leeway to procure a greater part of the production despite higher consumption requirements ofthe producer.",

Given the level of rice availability indicated in the production statistics, there is little doubtthathad the free transportation of rice been permitted the sharp differences in the price levels indicated earlier between areas would have been less. The forces of supply and demand operating freely would have tended to lower the price of paddy and rice and to ensure a better island-wide distri\u00adbution. The restrictions on transport did not, in fact help to bring down the open market price of paddy which has throughout remained above the guaranteed price. As long as the free market price was higher than the guaranteed price of Rs. 33 per bushel the regulations were not effective in stopping the sale and disposal of paddy and rice in the open market.",

    "text": "As against the satisfactory overall performance of domestic agriculture that of the main plantation industries was disappointing. The figures given in table I\u20147 show the progressive secular decline in the production of tea, rubber and coconut. In the case of tea, production in 1974 declined to 449 million lbs from the peak produc\u00adtion figure of 503 million lbs in 1965. Upto 1971, the average level of production was approximately 480 million lbs while in the last three years this has dropped to about 450 million lbs; the general indications are that production will continue to decline even further. Although rupee export earnings from tea have progressively increased, despite the fall in production from Rs. 1,210 million in 1965 to Rs. 1,360 million in 1974, the equivalent foreign exchange earnings in Special Drawing Rights have shown a marked fall from SDR 203 million in 1965 to SDR 168 million in 1974.

In 1974 rubber production at 301 million lbs was at a lower level than at any time since 1966. Despite the fall in production of 40 million lbs in 1974 export earnings rose by nearly Rs. 147 million. In terms of SDR, earnings however, have increased by nearly 250 per cent since 1972 when production was only marginally above the level achieved in 1974. In the coconut industry too production has improved only very marginally in 1974 since the fall in production by 38 per cent in 1973. At the 1974 level, coconut output is still some 33 per cent short of the record production of 2,963 million nuts in 1972. Despite the marginal increase in production in 1974, the very high prices fetched for coconuts in 1974, however, enabled the industry to more than double its rupee earnings and earnings in SDR terms. The decline in coconut production has implications not only for the balance of payments but also for the cost of living because a very large proportion of the output enters the domestic market. Both coconut oil and fresh coconuts are items which have an important place among the commodities in the Cost of Living Index. A significant decline in levels of production, therefore are bound to keep prices in the domestic market at fairly high levels. In the case of coconut, had the production in 1974 been at the 1972 level, export earnings from coconut alone would have been higher by about Rs. 670 million in view of the very high prices realised during the year.",

All this resulted in a sharp cut back in expenditure on replanting, manuring and maintaining properties in the best possible condition. In the context ofthe country's present economic difficulties, improvement ofthe quality of tea, rubber and coconut plantations need not be emphasised. In the case of the tea industry in particular, production is still dependent on very old plantations which do not have high yielding vegetatively propagated plants. The substantial gains in productivity in tea are largely dependent on replanting with high yielding clones. Despite the incentives offered in the form of a replanting subsidy the rate of replanting has slowed down considerably. At the same time, the machinery and equipment used in the manufac\u00adture of tea has not kept pace with technological change in the industry. Sri Lanka in this respect has had to face the challenge from technologically superior tea industries in the African countries. For investment to be maintained at a high level in the plantation industry, the most important consideration appears to be an assurance that irrespective of ownership, the efficient running and maintenance of plantations would continue for a long time.

The purpose of these field studies has been primarily to obtain an overall picture of how these properties are being managed and the contribution that produc\u00adtion on these lands are now making to economic growth. Many of these agricultural lands have valuable crops on them, mainly tea, rubber, coconut and also a wide range of minor crops. These crops are important from the point of view of the country's capacity to earn foreign exchange. If productivity on the lands that have come under land reform could be increased appreciably it would no doubt make a significant contribution towards easing the balance of payments problem.",

In a large number of the estates, the services of the former managers have been discontinued. Many of those who have been newly placed in charge of these estates have very little experience in planting although they displayed considerable enthusiasm for their jobs. Given the run down condition of the estates, a considerable amount of investment is now required to increase their productive capacity, but this has not been possible because the estates have been run on the principle that they should not spend an amount exceeding their current income. Since productivity has declined and incomes have been low, adequate resources for capital development have not been available. Equipment, spare parts for factories and lack of transport facilities are serious impediments to increasing production on most estates.

Tea production is probably best under large scale operation when cultivated as a mono crop. There appears to be an overall decision to indiscriminately diversify rather than plan diversification with a view to increasing production. There is a lack of decentralisation in decision making and project managers have little discretional authority.

    "text": "Considering the balance of payments difficulties, allocations of foreign exchange to industry were maintained at satisfactory levels; but 1974 was a difficult year for the industrial sector. The amount of raw materials that could be procured out of the foreign exchange allocated was considerably less than in the preceding year on account of the very sharp increases in the prices of all types of industrial raw materials ranging from plastics and cotton yarn, to chemicals and fuel. Purely in .value terms, industrial production has shown an increase of 48.4 per cent over the level in 1973; production rising from Rs. 2759 million in 1973 to Rs. 4094 million in 1974. These figures of course, do not give an accurate picture of the actual level of physical production. The increase in the value of production in 1974 has been very largely due to the high prices of raw materials which in turn resulted in substantial increases in the prices of all manufactured goods. Apart from this, the coverage in the 1974 Central Bank industrial survey has increased by approximately 5 per cent, bringing in several enterprises from which data had not been obtained on earlier occasions. From the standpoint of physical output, when allowance is made for the very sharp increases in prices, production in 1974 has been below the level in the previous year. For the manufacturing sector as a whole the national accounts show a decline in output in real terms by 4.1 per cent.",

In 1974 in value terms, petroleum production increased by 151 per cent whereas the volume actually declined by 15 per cent. If the inflated value of petroleum products is excluded from the increase in value of production at current prices the increase in the value of output from other sectors amounts to 32 per cent.",

The latter was primarily due to the continuing excessive dependence of most of the industries that were set up after I960 on imported raw materials. Greater capacity utilization, therefore, is very much dependent on the foreign exchange allocations that are given. This has created a permanent problem for the industrial sector as a whole. Since industrial raw materials get second priority over foodstuffs, drugs and other essential goods the country's foreign exchange earnings in relation to import requirements will not permit adequate allocations to be made for industry except for those industries which are entirely export oriented and are in a position to earn foreign exchange. On account of this, it is not likely that in the future all",

    "text": "Despite the fact that foreign exchange allocations for industries in the public sector have been available on a relatively more liberal basis than to private sector industry, capacity utilization continues to remain low and this cannot be attributed entirely to the shortage of foreign exchange and the non availability of inputs but rather to a large number of industries being unable to export profitably. Several public sector enterprises were given relatively liberal foreign exchange allocations in 1974 and some of them ran very high rupee bank credits to finance their stocks which were sufficient for several months. For instance in the Oils and Fats Corpora\u00adtion capacity utilization was only 61.5 per cent when the prices of poultry and cattle feeds were at a very high level in 1974. In the textile mills of the National Textile Corporation capacity utilization averaged about 40 per cent at a time when retail prices were high and there was an islandwide shortage of textiles. At the Salawa factory of the Plywoods Corporation, which is the principal supplier of plywood for the tea chest industry, capacity utilization was as low as 30.3 per cent. The latter has at least in part been responsible for the progressive increase in the price of locally manufactured tea chest panels. In the Ceylon Steel Corporation capacity utilization was about 40 per cent. Industrial units showing high rates of capacity utilization in 1974 were a few and among these were the Ceylon Tyre Corporation, which was able to use 90.7 per cent of its capacity and the Kankesanturai cement plant which utilized 76 per cent of its installed capacity.",

While there were fairly sound reasons for increases in prices in 1974, yet from the point of view of the consumer, certain other aspects have to be given due consideration.
