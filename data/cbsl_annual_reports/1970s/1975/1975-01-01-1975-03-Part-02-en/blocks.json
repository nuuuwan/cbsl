The Central Bank has therefore been alive to the need to train bank cadres in the techniques of project evalua\u00adtion and end-use supervision when credit is given under these schemes. The Development Finance Department accordingly made arrangements for the Director of National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM), Bombay, to visit Sri Lanka in February, 1975, together with two members of the faculty of this Institute. This visit was specifically arranged by the Central Bank for the purpose of promoting discussions with senior management personnel of the commercial banks as well as the Central Bank, with a view to formulating training programmes for bank officers in Sri Lanka. The intention of the Central Bank was to use the Bankers' Training Institute, which is jointly financed and managed by the Central Bank and the commercial banks, to arrange, organise and conduct training programmes, seminars etc. to make the use of credit more effective. On the basis of these discussions, the visitors agreed to sponsor the visit of a team of senior bank management personnel to India to familiarise themselves with the type of training work undertaken by NIBM and the larger commercial banks in India. The intention of the Central Bank in sponsoring this visit of senior bank management personnel is to make available a pool of specialised know-how for the conduct and management of training programmes in Sri Lanka. The visitors from National Institute of Bank Manage\u00adment (NIBM) also agreed to collaborate with the Bankers' Training Institute in the conduct of planned programmes.",
