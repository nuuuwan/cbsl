( 35 )

The Central Bank continued to be the custodian of the moneys collected in terms of the Compulsory Savings Act No. 6 of 1971 and the ceiling on income and Compulsory Savings Law No. 15 of 1972, and administered the Compulsory Savings Fund on behalf of the Government.

Asian Clearing Union

The Central Bank is a participant Bank in the Asian Clearing Union. Operations under the Asian Clearing Union facility commenced on 1st November, 1975.

Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme

The Central Bank continued to administer the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate Scheme on behalf of the Government.

Income and Expenditure

The income of the Central Bank for the year amounted to Rs. 165,714,000 and expenditure, including allocation to reserves and provisions for depreciation on the value of land and buildings and office furniture, amounted to Rs. 164,714,000. The net profit of Rs. 1,000,000 was carried to Surplus in terms of Section 39(b) of the Monetary Law Act.

Bank Supervision

In the year 1975, the Department of Bank Supervision examined eight Commercial Banks under Section 29 (1) of the Monetary Law Act thereby completing the examination of every Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka for the examination period 1974/75.

The Department continued to perform functions connected with the administration of the Bank Debits Tax Act No. 27 of 1970 and inspections of Commercial Banks were carried out for the purposes of verifying the information required to be furnished in the certificates of the Authorised Officer, under Section 15 (1) of the Act.

Development Finance Department

The Development Finance Department's main responsibility is the appraisal of development projects in respect of | which refinance is sought by approved credit institutions from the Central .Bank's Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund. The following table sets out the refinance approvals from the Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund of the Central Bank classified according to purpose:-

( 36 )

As in the past, the majority of the applications for refinance were in respect of loans for installing new machinery and equipment under the Asian Development Bank Tea Factory Modernization Loan Scheme. The Asian Development Bank Tea Factory Modernization scheme, which forms an integral part of the Government's development programme for the tea-industry, came into operation in 1968. A loan of U. S. Dollars 2 million was obtained from the Asian Development Bank to meet the foreign exchange costs of the scheme. This was supplemented by a second loan of U. S. Dollars 3 • 5 million in 1970. The rupee funds required to finance projects under the scheme are made available to commercial banks and other approved credit institutions from the Central Bank's Medium ck Long-Term Credit Fund. During 1975, 88 factory modernization projects involving Rs. 10-3 million were approved for refinance by the Committee administering the scheme.

Refinance amounting to Rs. 9-7 million was also approved for four government approved hotel projects. Of these, two hotels are located at Beruwala while the other two are at Habarana and Negombo. Among the industrial projects refinanced, two were for fruit processing and fruit canning, two for assembly of sewing machines and one each for the manufacture of agricultural equipment and synthetic resin.

Appraisal of loans for which cover was sought from the Credit Guarantee Scheme for the Tea Industry, and work connected with the operation of the scheme were also part of the responsibilities of the Department. The Credit Guarantee Scheme which was instituted in late 1974 on the recommendation of the Central Bank is operated by the Central Bank on behalf of the Govern­ment and was designed to assist tea producers who were finding it increasingly difficult to obtain loans for factory investment and tea replanting from the banking system. During 1975 guarantees were approved in respect of loans covering Rs. 1-6 million under this scheme.

In addition to servicing the Committees administering the Tea Factory Modernization Project and the Sri Lanka Fisheries Project, the foreign exchange costs of which are financed by the Asian Development Bank, the Department was also engaged in work connected with implementation of these projects, as well as the Sri Lanka Dairy Development Project which is administered by a Committee chaired by the Director of Plan Implementation and includes the Director of Development Finance of the Central Bank.

( 37 )

The implementation of these projects is vitally dependent on the effective use of credit which is made available by special arrangements with the banks which are in turn provided with refinance facilities from the Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund of the Central Bank. The Central Bank has therefore been alive to the need to train bank cadres in the techniques of project evalua­tion and end-use supervision when credit is given under these schemes. The Development Finance Department accordingly made arrangements for the Director of National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM), Bombay, to visit Sri Lanka in February, 1975, together with two members of the faculty of this Institute. This visit was specifically arranged by the Central Bank for the purpose of promoting discussions with senior management personnel of the commercial banks as well as the Central Bank, with a view to formulating training programmes for bank officers in Sri Lanka. The intention of the Central Bank was to use the Bankers' Training Institute, which is jointly financed and managed by the Central Bank and the commercial banks, to arrange, organise and conduct training programmes, seminars etc. to make the use of credit more effective. On the basis of these discussions, the visitors agreed to sponsor the visit of a team of senior bank management personnel to India to familiarise themselves with the type of training work undertaken by NIBM and the larger commercial banks in India. The intention of the Central Bank in sponsoring this visit of senior bank management personnel is to make available a pool of specialised know-how for the conduct and management of training programmes in Sri Lanka. The visitors from National Institute of Bank Manage­ment (NIBM) also agreed to collaborate with the Bankers' Training Institute in the conduct of planned programmes.

The Department also examined a proposal to set up an export credit guarantee corporation at the invitation of the Export Promotion Secretariat. In this connection two officers of the Department, along with an officer each from the Ministry of Foreign &. Internal Trade and the Export Promotion Secretariat visited the Export Credit and Guarantee Corporation Limited of India, for the purpose of studying its operations as a basis for making recom­mendations on the proposal for the establishment of a scheme of export credit guarantee in Sri Lanka. This visit was financed by the International Trade Centre, Geneva, which is extending assistance to the Government in regard to the proposal to establish an export credit guarantee corporation.

Government Loan Operations

According to the revised Budget Estimates for the financial year 1975, the budget deficit, estimated at Rs. 2,527 million, was expected to be financed from the sources mentioned below to the extent shown against each:-

Appropriation Act Loans •• •• Rs. 1,100 million Commodity Aid Counterpart Fund • • Rs. 791 „ Project Loans and Grants • • • • Rs. 398 „ Administrative Borrowings • • • • Rs. 250 „ leading to a cash surplus of Rs. 12 million.

The National Savings Bank, the Employees' Provident Fund, the Insurance Corporation and the Joint Investment Fund are found to have between them subscribed to 92-4% of the total loan stock issue. It may be mentioned that commercial banks are precluded from investing in new loan stock issues in view of the desirability of financing the deficit in a non-expansionary manner.

Issue of Treasury Bills

The limit to borrowing by Government by way of Treasury Bills has been set at Rs. 2,550 million by a resolution of the National State Assembly of 1972. 07. 21. Treasury Bills may, accordingly, be issued for the borrowing of

Appropriation Act Loans.

Since the target initially set for borrowing from non-bank domestic sources under the Appropriation Act was Rs. 900 million, nine loans of Rs. 100 million each were raised by way of loan stock issues under the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance in the first instance. However, in view of the upward revision of the target to Rs. 1,100 million and the availability of additional funds with semi-government institutions and agencies, a further issue of stock was made under that Ordinance and it was possible to mobilise, in the aggregate, a sum of Rs. 1,039,105,400 from non-bank domestic sources before the close of the financial year. A classification of the subscriptions to these government rupee loans by investor categories is set out in the table below.

( 39 )

sums not exceeding in the aggregate the amount specified in that resolution. Treasury Bills may also be issued to raise sums required to pay off at maturity Treasury Bills issued and outstanding.

In 1975, Treasury Bills to the par value of Rs 8,769• 9 million were issued whilst Treasury Bills to the value of Rs. 8,669-9 million were redeemed at maturity. The additional net issue of Rs. ICO million during the course of 1975, together with the issue outstanding of Rs. 2,250 million at the beginning of that year, brought the total Treasury Bill issue outstanding at the end of 1975 to

Rs. 2,350 million. A classification of subscribers by investor categories in respect of the Rs. 2,350 million Treasury Bills outstanding is set out in the following table:

Issue of Tax Reserve Certificates

During the course of 1975, Tax Reserve Certificates in a sum of

Rs. 47,824,200 were issued whilst Tax Reserve Certificates in a sum of

Rs. 45,916,988 were surrendered of which payment of tax accounted for

Rs. 39,666,275 and refund by way of cancellation accounted for Rs. 6,250,713. The net increase in the Tax Reserve Certificate issue was thus Rs. 1,907,212 and the proceeds of the net issue were made available to Government.

External Finance

Receipts of foreign loans utilised to meet the budget deficit amounted to

Rs. 648,409,288 during 1975 of which Rs. 270,250,936 were by way of project loans and Rs. 378,158,352 were by way of commodity loans.

( 40 )

Administrative Borrowings

The Sri Lanka State Trading (Consolidated Exports) Corporation received an advance payment of U. S. S. 32 million from the Bank of Melli, Iran, against future tea exports to Iran. The Rupee proceeds of the advance amounting to Rs. 245,023,727 were made available to Government by the Corporation. This sum has been regarded as an administrative borrowing repayable to the Corpora­tion by Government.

Budgetary Financing

The revised net cash deficit is now provisionally estimated at Rs. 1,800-9 million. This deficit is met as follows:
