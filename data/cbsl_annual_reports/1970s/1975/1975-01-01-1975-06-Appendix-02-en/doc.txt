Commercial Banks are hereby informed that with effect from today, the outstanding level of a bank's borrowings from the Central bank shall not exceed 8% of the total of the following asset items of that bank on December 31, 1974.

( 1 ) Bills discounted and financed;

(2) Loans (excluding loans granted under Government agricultural credit schemes); and

(3) Overdrafts;

subject to the provision that in the case of a bank whose outstanding borrowings from the Central bank as of today exceeds the stipulated limit that bank is not required to repay the excess immediately, but will not be granted any new advances until the outstanding level of its borrowings is brought within the limit. 'Borrowings from the Central Bank' in this context excludes refinance granted under Government agricultural credit schemes, the Guaranteed Price Scheme and from the Medium & Long Term Credit Fund.

The Central Bank, however, is prepared to consider applications from commercial banks for accomodation in excess of the stipulated limit, to enable banks to tide over temporary cash shortages. Such accommodation will be granted for very short periods and at a rate of interest of 2i% above Bank rate.

Central Bank's Circular No. 82 dated May 27, 1974, is hereby withdrawn. However, banks are required not to Increase their loans and advances for non-essential purposes such as consumption, speculative stock building, etc., over the level of such loans and advances outstanding as on December 31, 1974.
