    "text": "(a) E C O N O M I C G R O W T H In 1975, the performance of the Sri Lanka economy improved marginally in comparison with the preceding year. The Gross National Product measured at constant prices rose by 3.6 per cent in 1975 as against 3\u00bb4per cent in 1974. The rate of economic growth in 1975 is slightly higher than the average of 2-8 per cent for the period 1971-75. Nevertheless, it falls substantially below the average of 5 \u2022 1 per cent for the preceding five year period 1966 to 1970. These show that the Sri Lanka economy has experienced relatively slow and uneven growth over several years. In 1975, the Gross National Product at current factor cost prices rose by 11-4 per cent as compared with the increase of 30 per cent in 1974 and 19-6 per cent in 1973. The lower rate of growth of the Gross National Product in money terms in 1975 is mainly due to the slowing down of inflationary pressures in the economy.",

Measured in per capita terms real Gross National Product is estimated at Rs. 817 in 1975, an increase of 2 per cent over 1974. Per capita real national income* in 1975 is estimated at Rs. 716 whi^h is the same level as in 1974. The stagnation in real national income in 1975 reflects the effects of the adverse movements in the terms of trade on the level of incomes in Sri Lanka. The continuing adverse movement in the terms of trade over the years has to some extent contributed to negate Sri Lanka's achievement in the field of income distribution, because it has tended to depress the real incomes of these in the lowest income brackets thus nullifying their gains in income. In analysing the growth of the real gross national income, the changes in the terms of trade is, therefore, of special significance. In 1975, the import price index increased by 19-9 per cent while the export price index increased by 8 per cent. As a result, the deteriora\u00adtion in the terms of trade amounted to 20-7 per cent in 1975 compared to 10-7 per cent in 1974. Because of this unfavourable movement in the terms of trade, real national income increased by only 1-2 pet cent in 1975 compared with the increase of 4 \u2022 1 per cent in 1974.",

In relation to 1974 the increased contribution of the agriculture sector as a whole in '1975 was only Rs. 44 million. The perfor\u00admance of agriculture was mainly influenced by the sharp fall in paddy production by 28-6 per cent below the level in the preceding year to a total of 55-3 million bushels. In 1975, production in the Maha season 1974-75 fell by 52-7 per cent, while the Yala crop was lower by 16-3 per cent. The fall in the paddy crop in 1974/75 was mainly due to a severe drought and unfavourable weather conditions in the principal paddy growing regions of the country. The output of subsidiary crops, however, increased by 12 per cent in 1975. The largest increase occurred in kurakkan, gingelly, maize, manioc, sweet potatoes, chillies and red onions.

Rubber production was 328 million pounds in 1975 as compared to 291 million pounds in 1974, which is an increase of 12*7 per cent. This substantial increase in production was mainly due to the use of more fertilizer, and the increased acreage of replanted rubber which came into bearing during the year. In 1975, the area replanted with rubber was 7,980 acres, bringing the total area replanted to 323,558 acres, or 58 per cent of the total acreage under rubber. The production of coconut too increased in 1975 from 2,031 million nuts in 1974 to 2,447 million nuts. However, there was a fall in the quantity of fertilizer issued for coconut under the subsidy scheme from 39,311 tons in 1974 to 24,463 tons in 1975. There has been an appreciable fall in the last three years in the intake of fertilizer for coconut under the subsidy scheme. The increase in output was mainly due to a lagged response to higher rprices in 1974. These results belie the fear that land reforms would affect production in the short run.",

    "text": "The output in the mining and quarrying sectors increased by 30 per cent in 1975, compared with a decline of 28-3 per cent in the previous year. This was mainly due to an increase of 59 per cent in the value of gems exported. The expansion in activity in the manufacturing and service sectors generated income which more than offset the relatively lower contribution of agriculture to the Gross National Product. The value added in the manufacturing sector which consists of factory industry, cottage industry and the processing of tea, rubber and coconut, increased by 7-5 per cent as against a decline of 4-1 per cent in 1974. Value added in factory industry, cottage industry and in the processing of tea, rubber and coconut rose significantly. The latter was mainly due to an increase in the output of all three crops. The higher level of output in factory and cottage industry was due to the greater availability of raw materials. According to the Central Bank index of import volumes, raw material imports rose from 46 in 1974 to 56 in 1975, an increase of 22 per cent.",

The weight of imports in total resources was 19 per cent in 1975 compared with 18 per cent in 1974. Measured in real terms, however, the weight of imports in total resources is likely to be higher. Thus the volume of imports as measured by the Central Bank index increased by 23 \u2022 3 percent in 1975, compared with the decline of 29-1 per cent in 1974. It is, therefore, likely that a substantial part of the increase in real resources in 1975 came from the increase in the volume of imports.",

The relatively lower rate of increase in consumption expenditure is evidence of the easing of inflationary pressure in 1975. As in the previous years, resources available through domestic production fell far short of aggregate demand as measured by Gross Domestic Expenditure. In 1975, Gross Domestic Expenditure was 105-6 per cent of the Gross. National Product at market prices. The shortfall was met by an increase in international indebtedness of Rs. 771'-6 million and an increase in net receipts of gifts and transfers from abroad amounting to Rs- 560-4 million.",

    "text": "Table 2 gives the production trends in the principal agricultural crops in the last 10 years. The output of tea has tended to fluctuate at a much lower average level since 1965 when production reached 503 million pounds, the highest level on record. In 1974, production dipped to the lowest level in the decade to 450 million pounds. In 1975, production picked up again but it yet remains below the yearly levels of output in the five years preceding 1970. Rubber production had steadily increased upto 1970, rising to a peak of 351 million pounds in 1970. Thereafter in 1971 and 1972 production declined but sharply increased in 1973. Output in 1974 at 291 million pounds was the lowest on record since 1966, but indications are that production is now picking up. A similar trend is evident in the coconut industry where after the peak level of production attained in 1972 production has decreased sharply in 1973 and 1974 only to be arrested by a more favourable output of 2,447 million nuts in 1975 which is comparable to the level of production in 1969. Of the agricultural crops the performance of paddy has been least encouraging in 1975. After steady growth of production upto the year 1970 when output more than doubled in this five year period, reaching 77-4 million bushels, output thereafter has been erratic and increases have not been sustained. After three years of stagnation in 1971,1972 and 1973, there was a record crop in 1974 of 76-8 million bushels, to be followed by a very poor harvest in 1975. This low level of production has severely affected the growth rate for the year under review because paddy carries a considerable weight in the national accounts.",

    "text": "The contribution of agriculture has gradually declined from 35 per cent of the Gross National Product in 1970 to 32 per cent in 1975. A major change has been the progressive increase in the contribution of the mining sector from 0 \u2022 7 per cent in 1970 to 2-2 per cent in 1975. This is largely due to the growing importance of the gem industry, and the much greater proportion of the production of gems that now fall within the national income estimates because of the sharp reduction in illegal exports. The share of manufacturing industry has fluctuated slightly over the last five years varying from 12-6 Per cent to 14* 1 per cent but has not shown a significant increase since 1972. On the other hand, the share of the construction sector in the Gross National Product seems to have declined significantly from 6\u2022 2 per cent in 1970 to 4-5 per cent in 1975- This is largely due to the decline in the level of private investment in house construction. Although incentives such as subsidised interest rates and tax conessions on owner occupied houses have been given these appear to be inadequate. Furthermore, restrictions on rent, ceiling on houses and the continuing increase in the price of building materials have been additional factors. The share of transport, storage and communication and the wholesale and retail trade sectors have also been steady over the last 5 years while the share of banking, insurance and real estate has increased from 1-2 per cent in 1970 to 1-7 per cent in 1975. This is mainly due to the rapid expansion of banking facilities especially in the rural areas. The service sector has gradually increased its share from 12-2 per cent to 13-6 per cent in 1975 mainly due to the expansion in the tourist industry.",

The total harvest consisted of only 55-32 million bushels, whereas the output in 1974 was 76-79 million bushels. The shortfall in the crop was 21-47 million bushels or 27-96 per cent of the previous year's level of production. Poor weather conditions were the principal cause for the sharp decline in output and this is seen in the significant difference between the gross area sown and the gross area harvested, which was as much as 243,586 acres or 14 per cent of the total area sown. Furthermore, drought also effectively shrank the total physical extent sown; whereas 2 \u2022 04 million acres were sown in both seasons in 1973/74, the acreage declined by 15-6 per cent to 1-7 million acres in the two seasons in 1974/75.",

    "text": "With the substantial decline in the area cultivated, there was a corresponding fall in credit disbursements and fertiliser issues for paddy in 1974/75. In the latter year, fertiliser issues were only 37-3 per cent of that in the preceding year. Fertiliser prices were reduced on two occasions in 1975. These measures brought some relief to paddy farmers who may have become increasingly resistent to the use of fertiliser due to higher costs. The first price reduction was effected in May 1975 and in November 1975 the government reintroduced the 50 per cent subsidy on fertiliser. This subsidy thereafter applied to all crops. The policy of having an equal subsidy for all crops not only has an effect of reducing the cost of fertiliser for agriculture, but has prevented the leakage of fertiliser meant for one crop into another. This is likely to promote the rational use of fertiliser.",

    "text": "The total amount of credit utilised under the Comprehensive Credit Scheme in the 1974/75 cultivation year was Rs. 77-25 million. This represents a substantial decrease of Rs. 31-8 million from the total amount of credit disbursed in 1973/74. The bulk of this decline occurred in credit given during the Yala season 1975. With regard to loan repayment, 36-92 per cent of the Maha 1974/75 loans were repaid as compared to 46-95 per cent in Maha 1973/74. This is the lowest recovery rate recorded for any season since the inception of the cultivation loans scheme. However, this was in part due to the low level of paddy output and the high incidence of crop failure during this season. It shows a progressive decline in the rate of recovery over the years. In the first year of its operation, in 1967/1968, as much as 86 per cent of the amount of credit given was recovered and the average default rate upto the end of 1970 was less than 29 per cent. The sharp increase in the level of defaults from 33 per cent in 1968/1969 to 40 per cent in 1970/71 was due mainly to the decision to withdraw the hypothecation of ration books against agricultural loans. Although between 1971 and 1973 credit disbursements were much lower than in the preceding three years the default rate shot up sharply averaging about 36 per cent in the three years.",

In 1973/74 although credit disbursements more than trebled the default rate moved up very sharply to about 51 per cent from 37 per cent in 1972/73. This further rose to 58 per cent in 1974/75 making the average rate of default in the last 5 years 48 per cent as against 28 per cent in the period 1967/68-1969/70. Of the total amount disbursed, under the scheme for paddy in the period 1970/71 to 1974/75 alone as much as Rs. 136 million have not been recovered by the lending commercial banks. The latter have been able to maintain their loans for paddy cultivation because of the Central Bank guarantee of 75 per cent of the amount in default. The increasing rate of default on loans underscores the need for effective measures designed to ensure a much higher rate of recovery and the collection of past dues.",

These restrictions were first introduced in July 1973 and operated without a break until their withdrawal. The Emergency Regulations in regard to the transport of paddy and rice were instrumental in giving the Paddy Marketing Board a legal monopoly of paddy purchases. Paddy purchases by the Paddy Marketing Board have declined steadily from the inception. For instance, in 1969/70, out of a total production of 77-4 million bushels, 26-2 million bushels or 33-9 per cent were procured by the Paddy Marketing Board. In 1970/71 the Paddy Marketing Board procured the highest quantity on record when it purchased 32 \u2022 4 million bushels or 48.4 per cent out of a total production of 66-9 million bushels. The amount of paddy that the Paddy Marketing Board could purchase depends on the quantity of rice issued on the ration among other factors. In 1972/73 just prior to the introduction of the regulations, it was able to procure 36.4 per cent of the total",

Notable gains in production were evident in the industrial categories food, beverages and tobacco, paper and paper products and textiles. The expansion in the first group was mainly due to the increase in the value of output of aerated waters, arrack and other spirits and tobacco products. Output in the former categories rose appreciably and tobacco alone by over 300 per cent. There was a substaintial increase in food preparations and biscuits and sugar confectionary groups due to the availability of sugar at slightly lower prices in 1975 as com\u00adpared to 1974. The output of the textile spinning industry also rose sharply because of the improved supply position of raw materials. The manufacture of paper and paper products also rose very sharply. As against this, there were substantially lower levels of production in several industries which are important from the point of view of economic development. For instance the output of cement declined from 466,000 tons in 1974 to 388,000 tons in 1975, the value of output of plywood from Rs. 49 million to Rs. 8-5 million and footwear and leather products from Rs. 71-4 million to Rs. 25 million. It would thus appear that in 1975 industrial production generally increased in areas with a low priority and an interpretation of the published figures should accordingly be made with -this reservation.",

In real terms, therefore, the increase in the value of output of industrial corporations was only 1-04 per cent in 1975 as against 0-98 per cent in the previous year. Noteworthy gains in production were achieved in textiles, paper and milk, while cement, hardware, steel and leather products showed substantial declines. Capacity utilisation was low in a large number of public sector industries. The corporations which operated at less than 50 per cent of capacity included Steel, Fisheries, Oils and Fats and Tyre. This was mainly due to the non-availability of imported raw materials in sufficient quantities, organisational and management problems, the frequent breakdown of machinery and the inability to find export markets for a larger output.

    "text": "Changes in the performance of specific corporations had an important bearing on the public sector services, the balance of payments and the level of economic activity. For instance, the periodic shortages in the cement supply in 1975 were due to the low capacity utilisation in the Puttalam cement plant which averaged 43 per cent in the year. The main reason for the drop in the output in this plant was the shortage of good quality limestone in the usual area of supply. In the Ceylon Steel Cor\u00adporation the output of the rolling mill declined by 26-7 per cent in 1975, leading to a fall in capacity utilisation to 30 per cent. Output at the State Hardware Corporation fell substantially because production was largely geared to market demand. The production of the most important of its manufactures mammoties declined by 12 per cent. In 1975, the production of graphite fell sharply by 24 per cent over the level in the previous year. Exports of graphite declined by 39 per cent to 5,886 tons, making this the lowest export figure since the establishment of the State Graphite Corporation,",

Of this, the available effective fleet consisted of 4,622 buses in 1974 and 4,691 in 1975. There appears to be a significant difference as much as 33 per cent between the number of vehicles utilised and between those operated and owned. This shows that at any given time about one third of the vehicles are off the road. In 1975 the deficit between the average fleet operated and the number of vehicles required to provide a satisfactory service was 327 as compared with 358 in 1974. The State Gem Corpora\u00adtion in the last four years had been faced with a decline in its purchases and sales of gems. The value of purchases of' gems dropped very sharply from Rs. 107-5 million in 1973 to Rs. 12-9 million in 1974 and to Rs. 5-1 million in 1975. The main reason for the fall in the value of purchases was the change in the purchasing policy whereby the Corporation attempted to decrease the value of the stocks it held by reducing purchases. The value of sales of gems by the Corporation fell from Rs. 45 million in 1973 to Rs. 25-1 million in 1974 and to Rs. 14.8 million in 1975.",

In 1975, seasonal peaks in the flow of agricultural credit such as for the financing of paddy under the Guaranteed Price Scheme were less pronounced due to the sharp fall in paddy production. The credit requirements of the govern\u00adment corporations were also more modest due to the greater availability of imported raw materials and less price fluctuations in raw material markets.",

The size of the trade deficit was the highest recorded so far, even though the current account deficit was marginally less than the deficit in the previous year owing to an appreciable increase in the flow of outright grants. Despite aid flows, I.M.F. facilities and short-term trade credits, a considerable gap still remained in the balance of payments and this had to be financed mostly by increasing external banking liabilities.

Details relating to government borrowing from the Central Bank and the commercial banks are set out in Table 6. Government borrowings from the Central Bank rose by Rs. 171 million and this took the form of an increase in the Bank's holdings of Treasury bills, government and government guaranteed securities and in provisional advances. On the other hand, govern\u00adment reduced its borrowings from the commercial banks. The monetary expansion was accentuated by government reducing its deposits with the banking system and in utilising its balances with the Treasury to meet current expenditure. This was the very opposite of the experience in 1974 when government tended to build up cash balances in the banking system and in the Treasury, which had a negative influence on the money supply.",

These corporations were able to reduce their borrowings from commercial banks by Rs. 47 million and to increase their time and savings deposits by Rs. 32 million. Public sector corporations as a whole were able to manage with less credit from commercial banks because import prices remained more or less at the same levels and many of them, notably the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation, the National Textile Corporation and the Weaving Supplies Corporation were able to run down their accumulated stocks. The countervailing factor was the increased credit requirements of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. In regard to the cooperative sector there was a significant decline in the demand for bank credit for the purchase of paddy under the Guaranteed Price Scheme because of a sharp fall in domestic paddy production.",

This was a sequel to the monetary measures taken by the Central Bank in April 1975 which, inter alia, placed certain restrictions on the magnitude of Central Bank accommodation to commercial banks. Following these measures the commercial banks had no alternative but to intensify their efforts to increase deposit mobi\u00adlisation to support their normal credit operations. As an initial step commercial banks revised their rates on fixed and savings deposits. The minimum and maximum rates on fixed deposits of 3 to 12 months' duration were at 4i and 4f per cent respectively. The minimum rates were raised to 6 per cent in the case of 3 months deposits, to 65 per cent for 6 months, and to 7 per cent for 12 months' deposits. Similarly, the maximum rate on time deposits of 3, 12 and 6 months' duration were raised to 6f, 7 and 7f per cent respectively. On the other hand, the minimum rates on deposits of 2 years, 3 years and 4 years duration which stood at 4 | per cent, 5 per cent and 5^ per cent respectively were raised to an uniform rate of 7 per cent. While respective maximum rates which remained at 5 per cent, 5i per cent and 5\u00a3 per cent were unified at 7^ per cent.",

In the case of Bank Rate, this was because the Rate was already at a high level having been raised to per cent in 1970. The commercial banks responded to Central Bank measures by pushing up their own lending rates, although the increases were much less marked. The highest increase was in the inter-bank call loan rate where the maximum was raised from 5 to 8 per cent. The steep rise in the call loan rate, reflects in some measure, the degree of pressure brought to bear on the liquidity of the commercial banks following the restrictions applied on the magnitude of Central Bank accommoda\u00adtion.

The magni\u00adtude and direction of this change can be considered to be benificial from the view point of mobilisation of savings as well as the efficent allocation of resources. In fact, such a change in interest rates was long overdue in the context of rapid changes in the price level as well as the overall demand for bank credit in a situation of a limited supply of resources which called for quantitative restrictions as a way of rationing credit. However, the fact that interest rate changes have not kept in step with the pace of inflation calls for a further re-examination of the entire structure of interest rates so as to afford the saver a more realistic real rate of interest.",

During the year 105 new branches were opened, but the majority of them consisted of branches opened at Agricultural Service Centres by the Bank of Ceylon. In all, 97 Agricultural Service Centre branches were opened in 1975, bringing thgtotal number of such branches to 299. By the end of 1975 the total number of branches falling into the latter category exceeded the total number of branches of all commercial banks taken together. The People's Bank had sharply cut back its bank expansion programme by opening only 5 branches during the year. This must be compared with 11 and 22 branches opened in 1973 and 1974 respectively. The National Savings Bank opened one branch, increasing its total number of branches to 20. Total deposits of commercial banks increased by only Rs. 56 million in 1975 as compared to Rs. 386 million in 1974. Taking into account the changes in the price level in 1975 the quantum of deposits mobilised iri real terms must be far less. The bulk of the increase in deposits occurred in Sri Lanka banks where their share of deposits went up by Rs. 40 million in 1975.",

Although Bank rate was allowed to remain unchanged at 6| per cent, with effect from April 8 , 1975, the magnitude of 'Central Bank accommodation available at Bank rate was restricted to 8 per cent of selected assets of each commercial bank as on December 31, 1974. These assets included bills purchased and discounted, loans (excluding loans granted under the Agricultural Credit Scheme) and overdrafts. The borrowings from the Central Bank in this context excluded refinance granted under the Agricultural Credit Scheme, the Guaranteed Price Scheme and from the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund.",

    "text": "While commercial banks whose outstanding borrowings from the Central Bank as of 8th April exceeded the stipulated limit, were not required to repay the excess immediately, any fresh accommodation in excess of the stipulated limit was subject to a penal rate of 2*j percent above Bank rate. Simultaneously, the special reserve requirement of 38 per cent (28 per cent for the People's Bank) on marginal increases in demand deposits, which had become effective on February 1st, 1961 was withdrawn (for the People's Bank the effective date was June 9th, 1965). However, commercial banks were required to maintain the general reserve requirement of 12 per cent of demand deposits and 5 per cent of time deposits, wholly in the form of deposits with the Central Bank. The imple\u00admentation of the latter, however, had to be postponed as some banks found it difficult to conform to this requirement. Hence, the practice of allowing upto 75 per cent of the required reserves to be maintained in the form of currency notes and coins continued throughout the year. Simultaneously, the ceiling on commercial bank credit imposed on May 24, 1974 was withdrawn. Commercial banks were required not to increase their loans and advances for non-essential purposes such as consumption, speculation and stock building, etc. over the level of such loans and advances outstanding as at December 1974.",

After making an adjustment for a net receipt of Rs. 227 million from advance account operations, total expenditure in 1975 was Rs. 7,483 million. Actual recurrent expenditure authorised under the appropria\u00adtion Act increased by 14 per cent over the previous year to reach Rs. 5,153 million. Together with the supplementary estimates for Rs. 326 million authorised in the course of 1975, the total allocation was Rs. 5,188 million, revealing an under expenditure of less than one per cent. In 1975, development expenditure, exclusive of sinking fund contributions and direct repayments of loans, increased markedly by 53 per cent to Rs. 1,960 million. However, the total allocation for 1975, including the supplementary provision of Rs. 434 million was Rs. 2,421 million, and the resulting under expenditure of 19 per cent was below the normally observed range of 25 per cents.",

    "text": "The major sources of increased revenue in 1975 were, income taxes Rs. 171 million, Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates Rs. 91 million, selective salts taxes Rs. 82 million, import duties Rs. 59 million, general sales and turnover taxes Rs. 44 million and gross receipts of trading enterprises Rs. 20 million. All these increases in revenue except income taxes and import duties were less than in 1974. The major shortfall appeared under export duties where the decline was Rs. 230 million. The improvement of Rs. 171 million in collections from income tax is attributable to the payments of arrears and back assess\u00adments by tax payers. Better performance in the corporate sector also helped to improve collections. Accruals under selective sales taxes were higher as a result of the enhanced tobacco tax introduced in early 1975. Receipts from the sales of FEECs increased by a further 9 per cent over the previous year and remained the single largest item of revenue, accounting for 21 per cent of total revenue.",

Contractual savings are mobilised by the Employees' Provident Fund and the Insurance Corporation, while the primary source for voluntary savings continued to be the National Savings Bank. The Consolidation of the extended coverage under the Employees' Provident Fund introduced three years ago and the high deposit rates offered by the National Savings Bank broadly explains the higher level of savings coming in from the Captive market. The rate of 9 per cent on investments in government securities has enabled the National Savings Bank to maintain its rates on savings deposits. The widening scope of public sector economic activity has created on the other hand, a need for a progressively increasing transfer of private sector savings into the government sector. But the continuing dependence on private sector savings to finance projects with long gestation periods and low returns may create difficulties of raising resources to service the debt.",

The relaxation of inflationary pressures by early 1975 had a more pronounced impact on revenue through falling export prices, while the level of expenditure dictated more by the import prices and the prevailing domestic price level remained at relatively high levels. It was in this context that the government had to exercise restraint and contain its fiscal operations within manageable levels.

The domestic debt (Rs. 10,859 million) accounted for 75 per cent of the total outstanding debt, while the balance Rs. 3,705 million constituted the external debt. Net of sinking Fund contributions the total public debt increased by Rs. 1,933 million to Rs. 12,960 million. The average rate of increase for the domestic and foreign debt for the previous five fiscal years has been in the order of 11 and 15 per cent respectively. A further increase in the external debt in 1975 both in the volume and rate conformed to the rising trend visible in the last several fiscal years.",

    "text": "In the year under review there was a noticeable slackening in the rate of inflation whereas in 1974 inflationary preasures showed no signs of abatement. The easing of inflationary pressures followed the downward trend in the world prices of the country's principal imports. On account of its structural characteristics and its resulting dependence on foreign trade the Sri Lanka economy is very vulnerable to price movements in world markets. Increase in food prices in international commodity markets, higher prices for raw materials, manufactures and capital goods tend to readily bring inflation into the country and reinforce price increases that originate within the country on a more modest scale. Sri Lanka has little or no influence over imported inflation and this has tended to significantly accentuate price increases because imported goods account for nearly 22 per cent of the gross national expenditure. In these circumstances, the management of inflation has become a difficult problem for Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, in 1975 within this framework, monetary and fiscal policy continued to be increasingly directed towards containing inflation. Furthermore, in 1975 government used price controls to keep prices in check, and in addition was able to induce manufacturers and retailers to bring down the selling prices of essential consumer goods.",

The average annual rate of increase in the Index for the years 1965 to 1970 was 4- 2 percent, while the average for the period 1970-75 was much higher at 7 \u2022 5 per cent. However, as compared to the average for the last five years, the rate of increase in the index in 1975 was slightly lower. The budget proposals for 1976 contributed significantly towards restraining price increases and extended some relief to the consumer. Following upon the budget, the price of rationed rice, sugar and some items of clothing were reduced with effect from November 1975. Since these items carry significant weights in the Consumers' Price Index they had a significant effect in restraining sharp increases in the cost of living.",

The sub-index for fuel and light further increased by 7-3 per cent as a result of the increase in the price of crude oil in October 1975 by the petroleum producing countries. The latter necessitated the increase in the price of kerosene by -/48 cents per gallon.

In 1975, price controls were extended to several new items including sewing machines, margarine, toothpaste, sheet glass, infant's cereal foods and powdered milk. The price of rice issued on the ration was reduced from Rs. 2-20 to Rs. 2-00 per measure with effect from November 17, 1975. The latter price change was preceded by government's decision in early October to remove the restrictions on the transportation of rice within the Island. The freeing of the market in paddy and rice made a singular contribution towards a substantial decline in the price of rice and paddy in the deficit areas and boosted up prices in the surplus areas; with the result producers were able to get better prices. The increased availability of rice tended to instill greater confidence in the producer and consumer, and it disuaded people from hoarding or carrying excessive stocks. The data collected by the Central Bank on an island wide basis shows that the average open market price of rice per measure in October, November and December were Rs. 3-19, 3-36 and 3 \u2022 44 respectively. This must be compared with the price prevailing at the beginning of the year when in January and February the open market price of rice averaged Rs. 4 \u2022 50, while the price in certain deficit areas reached Rs. 7 \u2022 50 per measure. After December 1975, a further decline in the open market price of rice has been recorded.",

The rate of unemployment among females was not very much different from that of males. Unemployment was heavily concentrated in the rural areas. Nearly 74 per cent of the unemployed males and 79 per cent of the females were in the rural sector, indicating that 77 per cent of the unemployed resided in the rural sector. The percentage unemployed in the urban sector was 17 per cent and in the estate sector 6 per cent.",

The deficit for 1974 was Rs. 1,263 million and the outturn in 1975 indicates a further worsening of the balance of payments on visible trade. The more adverse trade situation emerges primarily out of a further sharp increase in expenditure on imports. Although in 1975 export earnings rose by over Rs. 500 million to reach Rs. 3,913 million over the level in the previous year, the increase in import payments was even more pronounced. Import expenditure rose appreciably by Rs. 671 million from Rs. 4,663 million in 1974 to Rs 5,334 million in 1975. Higher import outlays were necessitated on account of several factors. A higher level of rice imports had to be maintained to offset the shortfall in domestic production resulting from a poor paddy harvest. Furthermore, an increase in the price of crude oil meant higher payments for oil imports. The progressive depreciation of the rupee vis a vis several non-sterling",

Poor tea crops mainly in India and Kenya enabled Sri Lanka to increase her exports substantially without depressing prices. Earnings from rubber and coconut were less favourable than in the preceding year. Both commodities showed reduced levels of earnings, despite large increases in export volumes, mainly due to lower world market prices. The reduced level of earnings from rubber and coconut, were to some extent, offset by a substantial increase in non- traditional exports, particularly precious and semi-precious stones.",

This is the highest level of grants received by Sri Lanka since the commencement of the aid programmes.

Grants from the European Economic Community took the form of food, mainly wheat floor, while grants from Sweden consisted of cereals and raw materials for industry. United Nations assistance was in the form of food aid tied to cooperative farm projects and rural works programmes. The sharp increase in the price of oil and oil related products was a major contributory factor for the increase in assistance in the form of grants from donor countries. As one of the most seriously affected countries, Sri Lanka qualified for emergency assistance from the United Nations and the European Economic Community, which set up special funds to provide assistance to countries that fell into this category. To some extent the increase in the grant component of aid is also explained by the trend among certain donor countries to give aid increasingly in the form of outright grants.",

Since adequate financing from both non monetary and monetary sources was available to meet balance of payments needs, Sri Lanka utilised its external assets only to a very limited extent. The decline of Rs. 55 million in gross external assets occurred mainly as a result of the repayment of a sterling loan of Rs. 78 million raised in the London Money Market in 1953, for which government had in anticipation built up sinking funds. Hence external assets, net of sterling loan sinking funds which were Rs. 835-3 million at the end of 1974 showed only a negligible change at the end of the year under review.",

    "text": "Despite the continuation of the recession in industrial countries, for the first time in 1975, since the commencement of the tourist promotion drive in the sixties the tourist arrival figure exceeded the 100,000 mark. Tourist arrivals in 1975 exceeded the figure for 1974 by 18,193 or by 21-4 per cent. This outcome has been helped by tourist arrivals in increasing numbers outside the main tourist season. This expansion in tourist traffic was accompanied by a rise in earnings from tourism from Rs. 94-8 million in 1974 to Rs. 124>0 million or by 30-8 per cent. It will be seen that the rise in earnings from tourism was more than in the preceding years and was mainly due to the increase in the volume of traffic. The latter was due mainly to increasing numbers of tourists coming from new regions such as Japan and Australia in addition to those from the traditional centres of Western Europe and North America. To cater to this increase in traffic a total of 768 rooms were added to the existing accommodation facilities. This was the highest expansion of hotel room capacity witnessed in any single year so far. As a result of the expansion of the trade, employment opportunities in tourism rose markedly. The number of employees in providing direct services to tourists rose by 14\u2022 9 per cent from 11,484 in 1974 to 13,190 at the end of 1975.",

The quantity of tea exported at 469 million lbs. was the highest level recorded since the year 1967. Tea did exceptionally well in 1975 because it was able to reverse the continued fall in production in the preceding years, fetch better prices, increase the quantity exported and as a result sharply increase export earnings. Other traditional commodities did not fair well. In 1975, rubber exports, fell by Rs. 84 million to Rs. 654 million because prices remained depressed although export quantities increased. Earnings from the three main coconut products and fresh nuts were Rs. 397 million and showed a little change over receipts in 1974- For coconut products, the international market prices for coconut oil and desiccated coconut remained at unsatisfactory levels during the year. For instance, the f. o. b. price of coconut oil fell by nearly 50 per cent, while that of desiccated coconut declined by 45 per cent. On the other hand, earnings from one of the major non traditional exports, gems, increased sharply; receipts rose from Rs. 109 million in 1974 to Rs. 180 million in 1975. Since 1967, there has been an increasing trend in the value of other domestic exports but after the substantial increase of Rs. 497 million in 1974 earnings from other domestic exports declined by Rs. 83 million from Rs. 843 million in 1974 to Rs. 760 million in 1975. The composition of Sri Lanka's exports showed a noticeable shift towards the traditional commodities. The share of the three major products in total exports rose from 72 per cent in 1974 to 76 per cent in 1975. The substantial increase in earnings from tea exports in 1975 pushed up its share in total exports from 39 per cent in 1974 to 49 per cent in 1975, significantly reversing the trend in earlier years for the share of tea in total exports to decline.",

Along with this decline, there was a corresponding fall in export earnings. Export earrings from precious and semi precious stones, however, reached very satisfactory levels. Gem exports rose by Rs. 70-7 million to Rs. 180-2 million in 1975 The earnings of the State Gem Corporation from exports were only 5-6 percent of the total value, while the private sector contribution was 94-4 per cent In 1975, Japan emerged as the leading buyer of Sri Lanka gems surpassing Hong Kong.

This coupled with an increase in the import price index raised the value index for imports from 201 to 230. Rice imports increased by 57 per cent in 1975 mainly due to the severe fall in domestic production. However, the price of imported rice fell slightly. The value of flour imports in 1975 rose substantially from Rs, 856 million in 1974 to Rs. 1,002 million in 1975, As a result, the quantity of flour available for domestic consumption rose from 416,000 tons in 1974 to 467,000 tons in 1975. On the average, in 1975, the price of im\u00adported flour was higher than in 1974 by 9 percent. With regard to sugar, a larger quantity had to be imported in 1975, because sugar supplied by the Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation fell by 30 per cent. Stocks with the Food Commissioner increased from 5,000 tons in 1974 to 22,000 tons at the end of 1975 partly as a result of higher imports and the reduction in the ration. The quantity of sugar made available on ration annually was reduced from 57,000 tons in 1974 to 51,000 tons in 1975 and off ration quantities were reduced from 38,000 tons to 8,000 tons.

For quite a long time, Sri Lanka's balance of trade with these countries had been favourable owing to the non use of balance lying to Sri Lanka's credit to increase imports at a time when the country was despe\u00adrately short of foreign exchange. Since last year, this position has changed and is indicative of the effort made to use these trade arrangements to the advantage of Sri Lanka.
