In that year the economy experienced declines in the value of exports, the terms of trade and the volume of output in the domestic sector ; for these reasons primarily the balance of payments surplus in 1956 was much smaller than that in 1954 or 1955. In 1957 there was a further deterioration. The value of exports, excluding re-exports, decreased by about 4 per cent. With a fall of 3 4 per cent in the average export price and a rise of 5 7 per cent in the average import price, the terms of trade declined by 9 3 per cent. There was some contraction in the output of certain domestic products. The small payments surplus of 1956 disappeared in 1957, when there emerged a large deficit, and external assets fell by as much as Rs. 236 million.*",

The prices of tea and rubber fell; so that, despite some improve\u00adment in the prices of coconut products and of certain minor products, the average price of all exports declined.

In 1957, conditions were pro\u00adbably not as bad as in 1956. Hence paddy production rose in 1957 ; but the total output was still about 14 per cent below the 1955 level.

Among other factors was a carry-over into early 1957 of some imports that should have arrived towards the end of 1956, but for shipping difficulties due to the closure of the Suez Canal. The effect of this factor, however, would in some measure have been offset by smaller imports in December, 1957, due to delays in clearing cargo arising from disorganisation of normal operations in the Port of Colombo.",

The rise in the domestic group of the index was due mainly to two factors : (a) a decline in the output of some domestically produced food-stuffs as a result of adverse weather conditions and (b) the increase in spendable income. It should also be mentioned that the difficulties experienced in the Colombo Port, and the flood damage to transport facilities at the close of the year also hampered normal substitution by imports. The export group of the index rose, in spite of a decline in the average export price, largely because the price of coconuts, the most important item in the group, was higher than in 1956. The import group of the Cost of Living Index fell in spite of a rise in the average c.i.f. price of all imports. Among the rea\u00adsons for this were\u2014(a) the rise in the c.i.f. prices of sugar and flour, while the retail price of sugar was reduced in May, 1956, and that of flour kept constant, and (b) the fact that a number of import items showing large price increases, especially producer goods, do not feature in the computation of the Cost of Living Index.",

In view of the current recession in the United States and a slow\u00ading down in the rate of economic growth in Western Europe generally, it would seem that a substantial improvement in export prices is not likely. Import prices, in the second half of 1957, were generally lower than in the first half, and may fall yet further, though perhaps not to any appreciable extent. The budget is likely to continue to be in substantial deficit, especially in view of the necessity to repair damage caused by the December floods and to provide relief to flood victims, de\u00adspite the generous assistance extended to Ceylon by foreign countries and local volun\u00adtary contributions.
