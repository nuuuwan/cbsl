In view of the current recession in the United States and a slow\u00ading down in the rate of economic growth in Western Europe generally, it would seem that a substantial improvement in export prices is not likely. Import prices, in the second half of 1957, were generally lower than in the first half, and may fall yet further, though perhaps not to any appreciable extent. The budget is likely to continue to be in substantial deficit, especially in view of the necessity to repair damage caused by the December floods and to provide relief to flood victims, de\u00adspite the generous assistance extended to Ceylon by foreign countries and local volun\u00adtary contributions. In these circumstances, if the effects of the adverse tendencies are to be absorbed without some reduction in consumption standards, external assets will run down further.",

In so far as variations in income bring about small and shortlived changes in costs and prices, in production and consumption, and in savings and investment, no serious problems arise.

In fact, Government's net cash operating deficit in the calendar year 1957 created an increase in spendable incomes that more than offset the effects of the decline in export earnings and in output in the domestic sector.",

In a period when external assets are declining and the Government is running a budget deficit, the monetary authorities can play an important part in maintaining satisfactory conditions in the money and securities markets. A general restriction of bank credit to the private sector is likely, in Ceylon, to do more harm than good. Bank credit is at present mainly used for normal trading require\u00adments, credit granted for consumption of non-essentials being comparatively small. A policy of selective credit controls may prove to be useful, but since such controls are difficult to administer, they would not normally be resorted to, unless the cir\u00adcumstances were serious enough to justify their use. However, in May, 1957, the Central Bank issued a broad directive to commercial banks advising against the extension of credit for the import of non-essential goods. It is interesting to note that the volume of imports of consumer goods rose only very slightly, that is, by less than one per. cent, while the volume of imports of capital goods increased by over 22 per cent in 1957, as compared with 1956.",

There was some gradual increase in short-term market rates of interest in 1957, but Government securities prices were generally stable. When the prices of Government securities decline there is a reduction in the effective liquidity of the economy ; such a reduction in liquidity makes more difficult the financing of exces\u00adsive expenditure, and hence will be favourable to the balance of payments. How\u00adever, when the market for Government securities is not very broad, it is not advisable to follow a policy of maintaining considerable flexibility in Government securities prices. An important consideration, in these circumstances, is the need to foster the growth of the market, and this objective will be impeded if holders of Govern\u00adment securities are penalised at an early stage with enforced capital losses. Besides, the resulting increase in interest rates will make the financing of the budget deficit more costly.",

The increase is explained mainly by the reduction, in May, 1956, of the retail prices of rationed rice, from 50 cents to 40 cents per measure, and of sugar, from 67 cents to 62 cents per pound of white sugar and from 60 cents to 55 cents per pound of raw sugar. Since the reductions were effected only in the latter half of. the financial year 1955-56, their full impact was felt only in the financial year 1956-57. Among other reasons for the increase in the net subsidy was higher foreign cost of sugar and flour to Government. The average c.i.f. price of sugar increased from Rs. 488 per long ton in 1955-56 to Rs. 615 per long ton in 1956-57. Over the same period the average c.i.f. price of flour rose from Rs. 383 per long ton to Rs. 435 per long ton.",
