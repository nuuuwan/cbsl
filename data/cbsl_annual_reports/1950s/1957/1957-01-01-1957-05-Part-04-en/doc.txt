reduction of commercial banks' profit margins on foreign exchange transactions and

the limitation of investment abroad of commercial bank funds. The banks co­

operated, partly, by entering the Government securities market to a larger extent.

This factor contributed much towards maintaining comparatively low interest

rates on Government securities. The commercial banks adjusted themselves to the

situation also by gradually increasing credit to the private sector.

83. Price Control.—The controls imposed in 1956 on currystuffs, milk foods,

drugs and cement, in view of the disorganization in supplies that followed upon the

closure of the Suez Canal, continued through the early months of 1957, and in May

the last of these controls—that on cement— was revoked. However, on December

31, price control* of certain currystuffs and milk foods was re-introduced owing to

the delays in the unloading and clearance of cargoes.

84. Exchange Control.—Largely in view of the balance of payments position,

certain new restrictions were imposed with effect from August 15, 1957. They

included an administrative tightening up of control on the movement out of Ceylon

of capital of companies incorporated outside Ceylon and individuals resident outside

Ceylon. The release of exchange for investment outside Ceylon by residents of

Ceylon was also restricted. Among other measures was some restriction of holiday

travel and of transfers of emigrants' capital; but a non-national resident of Ceylon

'returning to his home country continued to be free to transfer his entire holdings.

Profits and dividends continued to be freely remittable as in the past.

IV. Basic Economic Data

Foreign Trade in Merchandise

85. The value of total exports in 1957 was Rs. 1,682 million, having decreased

by Rs. 53 million from its level in 1956. In contrast, the value of total imports

rose in the same period by Rs. 174 million to Rs. 1,804 million. As a result, the

balance of trade showed a deficit of Rs. 122 million in 1957. The terms of trade as

measured by the Central Bank trade indices declined by 9 3 per cent from 140 in

1956 to 127 in 1957, reflecting a fall of 3 4 per cent in the average export price and a

rise of 5 • 7 per cent in the average import price.

86. Exports.—Statistics of value, volume and price of exports from 1938

onwards are given in tables 27 and 29.f Though in 1957 the quantity of tea

exported was the largest so far, the value of tea exports was Rs. 22 million less than

in 1956, because of the greater effect of the fall of 7 3 per cent in average f.o.b.

price of tea. The share of tea in the aggregate value of all exports was nevertheless

60 • 8 per cent as compared with 60 • 2 per cent in the previous year. The contribution

of rubber to the value of total exports also showed a slight increase from a little

under 17 per cent in 1956 to almost 18 per cent in 1957. In contrast, the share of

the 3 major coconut products—copra, coconut oil and desiccated coconut—decreased

sharply, from 12 3 per cent in 1956 to 9 3 per cent in 1957.

87. The quantity of tea exports in 1957 totalled 368 million pounds, or 20

million pounds higher than that in the previous year. The increase was due in

large part to greater production, resulting from improved methods of cultivation,

such as the increased use of fertilisers, the control of blister blight, and to the good

growing weather experienced in most tea planting districts. The trend of prices

was disappointing. The average f.o.b. price of all grades of tea dropped from

Rs. 3 • 00 per lb. in 1956 to Rs. 2 78 per lb. in 1957, and the average Colombo market

price from Rs. 2-16 to Rs. 1 86 per lb. The average Colombo market price of high

and medium tea fell rapidly during the first half of the year. Thereafter, the

prices of high growns recovered somewhat; mediums remained depressed. Prices

of low growns fell from Rs. 2 08 per pound in the first quarter to Rs. 1 • 79 per

pound in the fourth quarter, but the annual average price of 1957 was, at Rs. 1' 88,

the same as that in 1956. All major buyers of Ceylon tea, except the U.K. and

Canada, purchased more tea in 1957. However, because of poor prices, the value

of exports to the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa and Australia were lower

by Rs. 44 million, Rs. 12 million, Rs. 8 million and Rs. 3 5 million, respectively.

88. Rubber exports in 1957 amounted to nearly 207 million pounds, being 19 million pounds higher than in the previous year. This increase reflected, largely, exports from stocks carried over from the preceding year, the volume of stocks at the beginning of 1957 being 71 1 million pounds as compared with 52 6 million pounds at the beginning of 1956. The increase in production itself was small, from 213 7 million pounds in 1956 to 219 9 million pounds in 1957. The average f.o.b. price per pound of all grades of rubber (excluding latex) declined by 7 cents per pound to Rs. 1 4 3 in 1957. This price was Rs. 1 5 3 per pound in January, but declined almost continuously to Rs. 1 • 30 per pound in December.

89. The average f.o.b. price of sheet rubber shipped to China was Rs. 1 • 64 per pound in 1957,* compared with Rs. 1 75 per pound in 1956.. The price of all grades of rubber shipped to destinations other than China also declined, from Rs. 1 48 per pound in 1956 to Rs. 1 34 per pound in 1957. The prices locally paid to the producer for sheet rubber purchased for shipment to China were reduced twice, in March from 141 cents to 126 cents per pound, and again in June to 116 cents per pound. On August 27. 1957, exports of sheet rubber were freed for shipment to any destination. Exports, particularly of sheet rubber to the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada, increased in volume and value in the latter months of the year. Exports of all rubber to China declined by 9 • 1 million pounds, or by Rs. 14 8 million, in 1957.

90. The volume of exports of the three major coconut products—copra, coconut oil and desiccated coconut—as measured by the Central Bank trade index . fell 32 • 3 per cent, as compared with the previous year, to the lowest level recorded since 1949. The sharp contraction was the result of the droughts in 1956 and 1957. The decline in volume of exports was compensated to a small extent by increases in the average f.o.b. price, which, for all three products together, rose by 8 2 per cent. The total value of these exports fell by almost Rs. 57 million.

92. The steep rise in the value of imports was largely in the " Raw Materials

and Manufactures " group, which increased by Rs. 142 million ; and its share of the

aggregate value of imports rose from 56 • 8 per cent in 1956 to 59 • 2 per cent in 1957.

The increasing share of this group reflects larger imports of capital goods, which, as

measured by a Central Bank Index, increased in volume from 144 in 1956 to 176 in

1957, or by 22 2 per cent. Some of the imports that increased in volume were

petroleum products (mainly fuel oil), fertilisers, machinery and cement. The

increase in the volume of consumer goods was quite small, 0 7 per cent; the volume

of textiles imported fell by 10 3 per cent, after successive increases in the previous

two years. In the main consumer group viz. Food and Drink, the volume of imports

declined by 0 • 8 per cent.

93. Pattern of Trade.—Table 31 shows the distribution of foreign trade by

significant regions and monetary areas. Lower exports of tea and the three major

coconut products to the Sterling Area, combined with an almost all round increase

in imports, particularly of raw materials and manufactures resulted in a trade

deficit of Rs. 122 4 million with the Sterling Area, in contrast with a surplus of

Rs. 29 9 million in 1956.

94. Exports to the Dollar Area declined by Rs. 6 8 million, but imports rose

by Rs. 23 8 million, chiefly on account of increased imports of machinery, textiles

and clothing, and chemicals. Consequently the trade surplus with the Dollar Area

declined by Rs. 30 6 million, as compared with the previous year. The value of

almost, all major exports to the Non-Sterling E.P.U. Area fell in 1957, the most

marked decline being that in coconut products, from Rs. 64 3 million in 1956 to

Rs. 29 5 million in 1957. But imports declined slightly. Hence the trade deficit

increased by Rs. 38 8 million.

95. Ceylon's trade surplus with China increased by Rs. 35 million to Rs. 83 million in 1957, the largest in four years. However, the total trade with China contracted sharply, by Rs. 65 million as compared with the previous year, chiefly because of a decrease of Rs. 50 million in imports from that country. In December, 1956, the price payable for rubber in the final year of the agreement, 1957, was fixed as follows :—

Premium payable Price at Singapore for corresponding grade of rubber 4£ pence . . . . . . . . Between 22J pence and 28 pence and at 28 pence 3 pence .. .. . . Between 28 pence and 35 pence and at 35 pence 2£ pence . . . . .. Between 35 pence and 40 pence and at 40 pence 1 penny .. . . . . . . Over 40 pence

96. The Five-Year Rubber-Rice Agreement between Ceylon and the People's Republic of China expired in December, 1957. A fresh Trade and Payments Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1958, was concluded in September, 1957. Under this Agreement, Ceylon undertakes to export during the currency of the Agreement an approximate quantity of 30,000 metric tons of rubber, and

( 23 )

China undertakes to export to Ceylon an approximate quantity of 200,000 metric tons of rice. The prices of commodities to be exported and imported under the Agreement will be world market prices. In addition to the clauses relating to these contracted quantities there is provision for additional sales or purchases of rice, rubber and other products.

97. An Economic Aid Agreement was simultaneously concluded between the two Governments, under the provisions of which the Government of the People's Republic of China agrees to grant to Ceylon economic aid in commodities priced at international market price levels for a period of five years from January, 1958, to the value of Rs. 15 million annually. The aid is for the purpose of financing part of the cost of the Rubber Re-planting Subsidy Programme.

98. The Trade and Payments Agreements with Poland and Czechoslovakia were extended, the former till March, 1958, and the latter till June of the same year. Trade Agreements concluded earlier with India, the Maldive Islands and Spain expired during the course of the year. A trade agreement was negotiated with Italy.

Money and Banking

99. Money Supply.—The money supply which had increased by Rs. 53 9 million in 1956, decreased by Rs. 86 7 million in 1957. The rising trend in the money supply which began in the early months of 1954 persisted up to the beginning of 1957. Having reached its peak level of Rs. 1,130° 8 million in January, 1957, the money supply fell almost consistently up to the end of the first half of the year. In the second half, however, after some fluctuation, there was a moderate fall. At the end of the year the money supply stood at Rs. 1,040 ° 1 million, having fallen by 7 • 7 per cent over the year.

102. Commercial Banks.—The main changes in the commercial banks' assets and liabilities position in 1957 are summarized below :—

(a) Total deposit liabilities fell by Rs. 78 6 million, or 7 7 per cent, to Rs. 942 • 1

million. Time and savings deposits increased by Rs. 18 0 million, but demand deposits decreased by Rs. 96 6 million. The fall in total deposits in 1957 was the result of a decrease in private deposits. Whereas Government deposits increased by Rs. 6 6 million, and inter-bank deposits by Rs. 3 8 million, private deposits decreased by Rs. 89 0 million.

(b) Cash assets, comprising till money and balances with the Central Bank,

decreased by Rs. 63 1 million to Rs. 120 • 8 million. The ratio of cash to total deposits also fell from 18" 1 per cent to 12 9 per cent.

(c) Foreign balances, including unmatured export bills, fell by Rs. 54 1

million.

(d) Loans and advances increased by Rs. 45 5 million. Although export and import bills decreased by Rs. 9 • 8 million and Rs. 1 • 4 million respectively,

( 25 )

overdrafts, loans and local bills increased by Rs. 37 7 million, Rs. 18 4 million and Rs. 0 6 million respectively. The ratio of loans and advances to total deposits rose from 40 • 0 per cent to 48 • 0 per cent.

(e) Investments decreased by Rs. 7 4 million. This is accounted for by a fall of Rs. 13 1 million in the holdings of treasury bills and a rise of Rs. 5 7 million, in the holdings of Government and Government guaranteed securities and Central Bank issues. The ratio of investments to total deposits, however, rose from 34 • 0 per cent to 36 • 2 per cent.

(/) Total liquid assets fell by Rs. 128 5 million or 29 4 per cent to Rs. 308 2 million.

(g) Excess reserves declined by Rs. 51 4 million to Rs. 8 0 million, in 1957. The average level of excess reserves was much lower than that of the previous year—Rs. 25 0 million in 1957 against Rs. 37-6 million in 1956.

Survey of Bank Deposits and Advances 104. The results, of the first two surveys as at September 30, 1956, and March 31, 1957, were published in detail in the December, 1957, issue of the Central Bank Bulletin; the detailed results of the survey as at September 30, 1957, will be published in the April, 1958, issue of the Bulletin^

105. Ownership of Deposits.—The surveys revealed that at the end of September, 1956, out of a total of Rs. 638 • 1 million of demand deposits, over a third belonged to individuals ; plantations owned a little over a fourth, financial institutions nearly a tenth and other business some 15 per cent.

106. Plantations and financial institutions were the more important holders of time deposits. At the end of September, 1956, plantations held over a third, financial institutions a fourth and individuals only a little over a fifth of total time deposits. Individuals held almost 90 per cent of savings deposits.

107. The following table shows the ownership of deposits as at the end of September, 1956, and of March and September, 1957.

110. Advances by Type of Security.—Among the types of collateral pledged for advances, documentary bills and stock-in-trade were the more important. The amount advanced against Government securities was relatively small.

108. Advances by Purpose.—Commercial bank credit to the private sector consisted predominantly of advances given for commercial, particularly foreign trade, purposes. At the end of September, 1956, nearly 75 per cent of total bank credit consisted of advances to commerce, of which nearly three-fifths were for export trading. While financial advances amounted to a little over a tenth, agricultural and industrial advances were together less than a tenth of the total. Over two-fifths of total advances were short-term (repayable within six months), two-fifths medium-term (repayable 7-30 months), and some 17 per cent long-term (repayable after 30 months).

109. The table below summarises advances classified by maturity under major economic groups as at the end of September, 1956, March and September, 1957.

112. Advances by Rate of Interest.—At the end of September, 1956, the most usual rates charged on advances were 4 per cent and 6 per cent. Over 90 per cent

of the advances were charged at rates ranging from 4 to 6 per cent.

Public Finance

114. Government Accounts.—Government's Accounts for the financial year 1956-57 are summarised in the table on page 30. The salient features of Govern­ment's operations in 1956-57 are as follows :—

(a) Government had a net cash operating deficit of Rs. 196'4 million, as com­pared with a deficit of Rs. 1 2 million in 1955-56 and a surplus of Rs. 127 • 6 million in 1954-55.

(6) Government revenue, at Rs. 1,260 5 million, was Rs. 3 3 million above the previous year's level. Lower receipts from profits tax, estate duty and export duties on rubber and coconut products were slightly more than offset by higher collections from income tax, stamp duty, excise and salt taxes, tea export duty and import duties.

Of the two main trading activities of the Government included in the Budget, the Railway showed a deficit of Rs. 24 9 million as com­pared with a deficit of Rs. 19 8 million in 1955-56, while the net profits of the Electrical Department increased from Rs. 3 5 million in 1955-56 to Rs. 4 2 million in 1956-57.

(c) Expenditure chargeable to revenue showed an increase of Rs. 90 • 8 million.

The increase was mainly the result of higher expenditure on food sub­sidies, education, health, social services and public utilities.

(d) Loan and Loan Fund expenditure at Rs. 213 3 million was Rs. 2-3 million

higher than in the previous year. Expenditure financed from the I.B. R.D. loan increased to Rs. 18 6 million from Rs. 5 2 million in 1955-56.

(e) Net payments on advance accounts amounted to Rs. 133 • 3 million as against

Rs. 29 0 million in 1955-56. These payments included an advance of Rs. 76 0 million to the Commissioner of Commodity Purchase for financing rubber shipments to China and Rs. 13 8 million for the main­tenance of food stocks and other Government inventories.

(/) Government's borrowing and lending operations resulted in a net receipt of Rs. 175 4 million which, together with the drawing down of cash balances by Rs. 21 0 million, was used to finance the deficit of Rs. 196 4 million.

Net receipts from borrowing and lending operations consisted of a withdrawal of Rs. 18 • 6 million from the I.B.R.D. loan and net borrow­ings of Rs. 156 8 million from domestic sources. The latter was made up of Rs. 6318 million of funded debt (Rs. 94 • 9 million of loans less a contribution of Rs. 31 1 million to sinking funds), Rs. 102 4 million of floating debt, Rs. 6 • 7 million on account of administrative borrowing, less a payment of Rs. 16 • 1 million on account of loans to Government agencies. The floating debt comprised advances of Rs. 96 3 million from the Central Bank and Rs. 9 • 1 million from the sale of tax reserve certificates less a repayment of Rs. 3 • 0 million of treasury bills.

121. Sinking Funds.—The value of sinking funds established for the redemp­tion of public debt was Rs. 248 8 million at the end of 1957, as compared with Rs. 225 3 million at the end of 1956. In the course of the year a sum of Rs. 5 4 million was appropriated out of the sinking fund to meet part of the repayment of the 3J per cent National Loan, 1957. The increase in the sinking fund, despite this withdrawal and a depreciation in the value of sinking fund investments, was due to contributions from revenue and the accrual of interest on the investments.

( 33 )

122. Floating Debt.—The proportion of floating debt to total debt rose from 5 1 per cent in 1956 to 9 6 per cent in 1957. There was an increase of Rs. 69 5 million in the floating debt, as compared with the increase of Rs. 10 • 0 million in 1956. Central Bank advances amounted to Rs. 32 6 million at the end of 1957. The volume of treasury bills outstanding increased by Rs. 20 million over the year. The total amount of tax reserve certificates outstanding at the end of 1957 was Rs. 16 9 million. The Central Bank commenced, on July 2, 1957, the issue of Tax Reserve Certificates, in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Reserve Certi­ficates Act, No. 22 of 1957. They are issued in denominations of Rs. 100 or multiples of Rs. 100, and can be surrendered to the Commissioner of Income Tax for payment of income tax or profits tax and, if not presented for payment of tax, can be tendered for cancellation. The surrender value of these certificates is the aggregate of the denominational value and interest calculated at 1 per cent per annum in respect of each completed period of one month from the date of the Certificates to the date on which tax is due. No interest is payable on Certificates tendered for cancellation. The maximum amount fixed for the first issue of Tax Reserve Certificates by the Minister of Finance is Rs. 50 million.

Prices, Wages and Employment

128. Prices.—Retail prices, as measured by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index, were on the average 2 6 per cent higher in 1957 than in 1956. The index rose slightly in the first quarter and more sharply in the second quarter of the year largely owing to a rise in the prices of domestically produced goods. There was .a downward trend in August and September but the index again rose steadily in

( 35 )

the last quarter. During most of the year the drought affected supplies of certain domestic products. The floods which occurred towards the close of the year, wor­sened the position, necessitating the introduction of price control in respect of subsidiary foodstuffs. The movements in the Colombo Consumers' Price Index and its three component groups are given in the table below :—

'From corresponding period of 1956.

129. Wages.—In 1957, the wage rates of tea and rubber estate workers were 1' 0 per cent higher than in 1956, but their real wages were lower by 1 • 6 per cent. The wage rates of Government unskilled workers rose by 3 • 0 per cent owing to an increase in the cost of living allowance with effect from November, 1957, resulting in a rise in their real wages by 0 • 3 per cent. The wage rate index of workers in the agricultural trades was higher by 1 • 4 per cent, largely as a result of an increase in the daily basic wage rates of workers in the coconut-growing trade in January, 1957. The wage rates of workers in trades other than agriculture also rose by 1 • 7 per cent, partly as a result of increases in the basic wage rates of apprentices in the printing trade and of workers in the coconut manufacturing trade in December. Real wages in these Wages Boards trades declined by about 1 per cent as compared with 1956.

130. Employment.—Data on the number of registrants at the employment exchanges are given below :—

( 36 •)

131. The figures of registrants include both unemployed and those seeking better employment. The significance of the data is further limited by the fact that, in general, workers in the estate and rural sectors make little use of the exchanges.

Production and National Income

132. The production of the principal crops in the years 1956 and 1957 is shown in the table below :—

+ 5-9 + 2-9 —17-1 + 13-8

•Revised figures. ^Estimated.

133. Though the production of tea and rubber increased in 1957, their export prices were lower. On the other hand, the export prices of coconut products rose, but the fall in coconut output was much greater. Paddy output, in spite of the drought of 1957, was higher in that year than in 1956, but was still below the level of 1955. The value of Gross National Product for 1957 at current prices is estimated by the Central Bank to be in the region of Rs. 5,150 million.

Balance of Payments

134. According to provisional estimates, Ceylon had a current account deficit of Rs. 199 million in the balance of payments for 1957, in contrast with a surplus of Rs. 82 million (as revised) for the previous year. The deterioration was almost wholly due to a decline of nearly Rs. 266 million in the merchandise surplus, from Rs. 314 million in 1956 to Rs. 48 million in 1957.

135. Net payments for foreign travel remained almost unchanged. The net outflow on account of transportation increased from Rs. 62 • 2 million in 1956 to Rs. 69 1 million in 1957, due mainly to higher freight payments. Although the gross outflow on investment income was smaller by Rs. 2 9 million in 1957 than in 1956, the net outward payment increased slightly, because of lower earnings by Ceylon from its investments abroad. Net receipts on account of Government expenditure showed a decline of Rs. 4 0 million, due both to a slight increase in outward remittances for diplomatic expenses, and a fall in receipts for foreign military expenditure in Ceylon, resulting from the transfer of British bases to the Ceylon Government.

136. On private remittances and migrants' transfers, the net outflow was Rs. 66 • 0 million, or Rs. 17 3 million less than in 1956. While remittances for main­tenance of dependants in India decreased by only Rs. 2 • 8 million, migrants' transfers in respect of compulsory repatriates fell by Rs. 9 8 million.

V. Operations and Accounts of the Central Bank

139. Financial accounts of the Central Bank for the year 1957 are given in table 6. The main changes in comparison with 1956 were :—-

Increase + ; Decrease —.

140. The ratio of the International Reserve to total demand liabilities decreased from 111 2 per cent at the end of 1956 to 101 0 per cent at the end of 1957.

141. The Central Bank's rates for advances to commercial banks against the pledge of Government securities and for discounts of Ceylon Government treasury bills remained unchanged at 2J per cent and 1/8 of one per cent over the last accepted average tender rate, respectively.

142. The reserve ratios to be maintained by commercial banks with the Central Bank also remained unchanged at 10 per cent for demand deposits and 5 per cent for time and savings deposits.

143. The Central Bank's rates for U.S. dollars were changed from time to time (as shown in Appendix I) in alignment with movements in the sterling-dollar

137. On privati^acaount, there was a net outflow, of Rs. 46 • 7 million in 1957, compared with Rs. 19 • 8 million in 1956. This wasauejo'tne cmoJv^nitents"of short term capital to Ceylon in 1957. Repatriation of foreign capital, at Rs. 43 2 million, in 1957, was Rs. 9 5 million lower than in the previous year. The inflow of foreign private capital for investment in Ceylon was Rs. 3 • 3 million, in 1957, as compared with Rs. 5 4 million, in 1956. Sterling companies operating in Ceylon reduced their balances held in London by Rs. 6 3 million, in 1957.

138. The sharp deterioration in the balance of payments had its impact on external assets, which registered a decline of Rs. 236 2 million during 1957. External assets continued to fall throughout the year, except for a brief interruption in the third quarter, due wholly to a repayment by China of the balance outstanding as at the end of 1956 in the account maintained under the bilateral agreement. The liability on account of I.B.R.D. drawings increased by Rs. 23 3 million in 1957, compared with Rs. 8 9 million in 1956.
