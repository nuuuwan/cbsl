In the Annual Report of the Central Bank for 1954 mention was made of the remarkable economic and financial recovery which Ceylon achieved in that year. In general, 1955 was even a better year for the Ceylon economy than 1954. Because of the dominant role which foreign trade plays in Ceylon's economic activities, the terms of trade to a very great extent determine the level of real income. On the average the terms of trade showed about a 10 -0 per cent increase in 1955 over 1954. This improvement, together with the very favourable position as regards Govern\u00adment's finances, was mainly responsible for a record balance of payments surplus estimated at Rs. 317 -6 million. The external assets increased by Rs. 200 million.* In 1954 external assets increased by Rs. 288 million, but of this increase Rs. 63 -3 million represented the proceeds of a loan floated in London. In 1955 Government's external borrowings were limited to withdrawals of Rs. 8 -9 million from the I.B.R.D. loan negotiated in 1954. At the end of 1955 total external assets, at Rs. 1,155 million, were roughly equivalent to 79 per cent of the value of imports for that year.",

From the middle of March, however, tea prices declined drastically, the average f.o.b. price for June being Rs. 2 -63 as compared with a price of Rs. 4 -47 for February. During the latter part of 1955 there was a moderate recovery in tea prices, but although the year closed with prices at generally reasonable levels, there was considerable uncertainty regarding the future course of prices. The trend of prices of the three major coconut products was also unsatisfactory, being generally downward throughout the year. Rubber prices, on the other hand, generally improved during 1955.",

The increase in money supply was not inflationary because it was held mainly by individual tea producers and companies, who could be regarded as having comparatively high average and marginal propensities to save. Two reasons can be adduced for this view ; (a) concentration of ownership is, on the whole, much greater in the case of tea than in rubber or coconut, and (b) foreign ownership is quite considerable in tea. A further factor responsible for the non-inflationery character of the expansion in money supply was the increase in the transactions demand for money caused both by the increase in the value of exports as well as the increase in domestic goods produced for home consumption. The increase in the volume of domestic goods, particularly rice, coming into the market is perhaps the main explanation for the increase in the currency circulation by Rs. 43 million during 1955.",

    "text": "14. As pointed out in the Annual Report for 1954, in countries greatly depend-ent on the export of agricultural commodities the prices of which fluctuate widely, fiscal measures are fundamental in keeping the economy on an even keel over a number of years. During periods of high export prices the Government should accumulate budget surpluses so that budget deficits can be run when export prices are unfavourable. This, of course, does not mean that in the long-run budget surpluses must exactly equal budget deficits ; such a policy of perfect budgetary balance may maintain the total spendable income relatively stable, but it may do so at an unnecessarily low level. Some expansion in the total public debt, consistent with the growth of the economy and the avoidance of inflationary pressure, is quite justifiable in any economy. In the case of export economies, however, budget deficits when incurred may also be financed from accumulated Government savings plus borrowings of money savings of the private sector. By this means total spendable income can be maintained at a relatively high and constant level, with an external financial situation that is always basically sound.",
