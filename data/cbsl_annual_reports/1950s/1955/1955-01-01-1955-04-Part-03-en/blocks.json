    "text": "11. The increase in money supply was not inflationary because it was held mainly by individual tea producers and companies, who could be regarded as having comparatively high average and marginal propensities to save. Two reasons can be adduced for this view ; (a) concentration of ownership is, on the whole, much greater in the case of tea than in rubber or coconut, and (b) foreign ownership is quite considerable in tea. A further factor responsible for the non-inflationery character of the expansion in money supply was the increase in the transactions demand for money caused both by the increase in the value of exports as well as the increase in domestic goods produced for home consumption. The increase in the volume of domestic goods, particularly rice, coming into the market is perhaps the main explanation for the increase in the currency circulation by Rs. 43 million during 1955.",

As pointed out in the Annual Report for 1954, in countries greatly depend-ent on the export of agricultural commodities the prices of which fluctuate widely, fiscal measures are fundamental in keeping the economy on an even keel over a number of years. During periods of high export prices the Government should accumulate budget surpluses so that budget deficits can be run when export prices are unfavourable. This, of course, does not mean that in the long-run budget surpluses must exactly equal budget deficits ; such a policy of perfect budgetary balance may maintain the total spendable income relatively stable, but it may do so at an unnecessarily low level. Some expansion in the total public debt, consistent with the growth of the economy and the avoidance of inflationary pressure, is quite justifiable in any economy. In the case of export economies, however, budget deficits when incurred may also be financed from accumulated Government savings plus borrowings of money savings of the private sector. By this means total spendable income can be maintained at a relatively high and constant level, with an external financial situation that is always basically sound.",

These measures were thus under\u00adtaken with a view to preventing banks from expanding credit excessively. The possibility of an excessive expansion of credit was, however, less in 1955 as those who held high cash balances in 1955 were mainly tea (and to some extent rubber) producers. They had built up their balances mainly by monetising their high export receipts, not by obtaining increased bank credit. Restrictions imposed on bank credit would have done nothing to reduce liquidity generated by this cause. On the contrary, since such restrictions would have fallen most heavily on exporters and shippers, some injury to the economy might well have resulted by the export trade being deprived of necessary finance.",

The Government loans were issued partly in conversion of maturing stock. Towards the end of the year the Govern\u00adment was further advised to issue a medium and a long-term loan aggregating Rs. 50 million. In addition the Central Bank decided to supplement the two Gov\u00adernment issues by two short-term issues of its own amounting to Rs. 10 million.* This was the first time that the Central Bank decided to issue its own securities. Two special considerations influenced the decision to issue Central Bank securities ; they were firstly, the possibility of developing the Central Bank paper as a security specially attractive to the non-banking private sector and secondly, the need to expand the existing small security market of the country.",

The main factor behind the substantial increase in the cash surplus in 1954-55, was the large increase in revenue from the tea export duty. The export duty on tea which was 75 cts. per pound at the beginning of the financial year was raised to Re. 1 -00 per pound in November, 1954, and to Rs. 1 -30 per pound in January, 1955. With the break in tea prices, the duty was lowered to Re. 1 -00 per pound in April, 1955, and (after a short-lived subsidy scheme) to 50 cts. per pound in June, 1955. As prices revived, the duty was raised to 65 cts. per pound in September, 1955, at which level it now remains. The net result of the changes in the export duty was an increase of Rs. 97 -1 million in the revenue from the tea duty over the original budget estimate of Rs. 204 million.",

The expenditure chargeable to revenue exceeded the original estimate by Rs. 57 -6 million mainly because of increased expenditure on the servicing of public debt and on wages and salaries following the salary revisions announced in April, 1955. The increase in expenditure chargeable to revenue was, however, more than offset by a short-fall of Rs. 72 million in the loan fund expen\u00additure and the expenditure from the National Development Reserve taken together.",

The capital expenditure of Government in 1954-55 was Rs. 359 million.* This represents an under-expenditure of about 21 per cent of the original estimate of Rs. 460 million for the year. The corresponding percentages for 1952-53 and 1953-54 were 33 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Thus it is apparent that the bottle-neck in recent years as regards public investment has not been a lack of finance. The full implementation within schedule of the Six-Year Programme of Investment will depend largely on the ability of Government to make greater use than hitherto of funds voted each year by Parliament for capital expenditure. One of the main tasks of the Commission on Government expenditure, which the Government proposes to appoint, would, perhaps, be to consider this problem.",

Subsequently, with the continuing decline in the price of imported rice (especially as a result of the lower contract price for 1955 of China rice), and flour and sugar, Government found it possible to grant in November, 1954, an in\u00adcrease in the quantity of subsidised rice allowed on the ration. The effect of the increase was to equalise the ration of all categories of ration book holders. In March, 1955, the contract price of Burma rice for 1955 was reduced to \u00a342 per long ton from the earlier contract price of \u00a348 per long ton. Following this reduction the price of rationed rice was lowered in May from 55 cents to 50 cents per measure.",

Although the loanable resources of banks may fluctuate considerably, the level of bank credit tends to be relatively stable, any moderate changes in credit extension being normally accounted for by changes in the needs for finance of the export trade. Such conservative lending policies are, for Ceylon, partly an advantage and partly a weakness. They arc an advantage to the economy in that bank credit expansion does not accentuate the swings of the economy caused by fluctuations in export prices. Thoy are a weakness in that if conservatism becomes too rigid a creed, they would be utterly inappropriate in an economy requiring rapid development.",
