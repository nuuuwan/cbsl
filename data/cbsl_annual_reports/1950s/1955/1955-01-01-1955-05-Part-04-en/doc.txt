power to sell its investments at any time it considers appropriate and re-invest the proceeds in other undertakings, thus ensuring the maximum developmental use of its resources.

55. The Corporation will also initiate new projects where it is practicable and necessary to do so. In those projects with which the Corporation is connected it will take an active interest, and will be ready to assist in securing managerial, technical and administrative advice. In these matters the Corporation will have the assistance of the Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research established in 1954.

56. Though the Corporation has been established with the support of the Government, it has been designed as an autonomous private body without Gov­ernment control over its management. It will be a private enterprise, making financial assistance and technical advice available to private industrial and agricultural enterprises. The broad national interests of the country are pro­tected by the statutory proviso that a majority of the shareholder-directors shall at all times be citizens of Ceylon.

57. Exchange Control.—The Central Bank administers exchange control as the agent of the Government. The scope and pattern of control are determined broadly by the current and prospective balance of payments situation (due regard being also taken of the country's obligations as a member of the sterling area), and the need for accumulating adequate foreign exchange reserves for economic develop­ment. Changes in exchange control regulations were last made in 1953, and were designed so as to be stringent on capital transfers whilst allowing current transfers to be made with little hindrance. No change in this policy was made in 1955.

58. Exports.—Statistics of value, volume and price of exports from 1938 onwards are given in tables(1) 26, 28 and 29. The total value of exports increased 7 -2 per cent from Rs. 1,809 million in 1954 to Rs. 1,940 million in 1955 exceeding the previous record of Rs. 1904 million reached in 1951. The average price rose 4-6 per cent and volume 5 -9 per cent. The share of tea in the export trade remained unchanged at the very high proportion reached in 1954, while that of rubber improved.

( 16 )

63. The volume of food imported as measured by an index showed no change

compared with the previous year. The value of food imported in 1955, however,

was the lowest in recent years, due to a decline of 10 -7 per cent in the average price.

The average c.i.f. price per ton of rice fell from Rs. 801 in 1953 to Rs. 690 in 1954

and again to Rs. 585 in 1955. The share of non-food items rose in 1955. The

value of textiles imported increased 4 -8 per cent; the average price decreased 2 -9

per cent but the volume increased 8 -8 per cent. The volume of other consumer

goods imported remained unchanged.

64. Pattern of Trade.—Table 30 shows the distribution of foreign trade by signi­

ficant regions and monetary areas. The traditional pattern of trade, a deficit with

the sterling area more than offset by a surplus with the non-sterling area, changed in

1954. In that year there were surpluses both with the sterling area and with the

non-sterling area. The changed pattern persisted in 1955, but the surplus with the

sterling area fell from Rs. 217 -6 million to Rs. 188 -0 million, but with other areas

the surplus increased from Rs. 137 -2 million to Rs. 233 -1 million. The increase in

the surplus with other areas was the result of an improvement in the trade balance

with the dollar and the non-sterling E.P.TJ. areas,

65. Taken together the countries in the sterling area constitute the largest market

for Ceylon's exports, and are in turn the most important source of supply. In 1955

the value of exports and imports remained very nearly at the levels reached in 1954.

66. Ceylon's trade surplus with the dollar area increased in 1955. In January a

decision was taken to allow the export of sheet rubber to destinations other than

China as exports to that country had proceeded ahead of scheduled deliveries.

^Consequently, in 1955 the value of sheet rubber exported to the dollar area increased

byRs. 17 -5 million. Further, there was a marked increase in the value of crepe rubber

(Rs, 28 -1 million) exported to the dollar area and substantial increases in exports

( 17 )

of tea (Rs. 13 million) and coconut products (Rs. 11 million). The value of dollar imports also increased, but by a smaller amount. The increase in imports was accounted for almost entirely by greater imports of machinery and sugar.

67. The turnover of trade with China contracted sharply in 1955 to a little more than half the level in 1954. This was due to declines in the volumes of both rubber and rice and a reduction in the price of rice. Under the five-year rice—rubber agreement concluded with that country Ceylon undertook to export 50,000 metric tons of sheet rubber during each of the 5 years commencing 1953. The price for the top grades of sheet rubber for the year 1955 was fixed initially at 27 pence (Rs. 1 -50) per pound f.o.b. Colombo ; later, in October, this price was revised as follows:—

Premium payable Price at Singapore for corresponding grade of rubber

5 pence . . . . . . . . Between 22 pence and 35 pence and at 35 pence 4 ponce . . . . . . . . Between 35 pence and 40 pence and at 40 ponce 3 pence . . . . . . . . Over 40 pence

A price of 27 pence will be paid when the monthly average Singapore f.o.b. market price falls below 22 pence a pound.

68. The revised price was payable with retrospective effect for deliveries made from June, 1955. Of the amount contracted for delivery in 1955, 13,100 tons were shipped ahead of schedule in 1954, and 32,180 tons were shipped in 1955 leaving a balance of 4,720 tons to be shipped in the following year. The agreement provided for the delivery of 270,000 metric tons of rice annually. Of this amount Ceylon took delivery under the 1955 contract of 105,547 metric tons of rice shipped direct from China at a price of £39 (Rs. 520) f.o.b. China ports. A further 50,800 metric tons of rice were shipped from Burma on account of China.

69. Ceylon's rice agreement with Burma provided for annual purchases of 200,000 long tons of rice during the period 1953 to 1957. The contract price for 1955 was £42 per ton (£8 less than for 1954). 185,472 tons of rice (Rs. 71 -6 million) were imported in 1955 from this source.

70. In December, 1955, a Trade and Payments Agreement was concluded with Po­land. The Trade Agreement provides for most-favoured-nation treatment, Ceyloni-sation and the exchange of lists of commodities available for export from the two countries to each other. Ceylon has listed rubber, copra, tea, coir fibre and coir yarn, among other things, while Poland has listed sugar, cement, textiles and iron and steel products among others. The Payments Agreement provides for a reci­procal swing credit of £400,000 sterling.

Money and Banking

71. Money Supply.—The rising trend of the money supply, which persisted during the latter half of 1954, was broken in January, 1955, when it fell slightly. After some fluctuation in the first quarter of 1955, it fell steadily during the second quarter. From the beginning of the third quarter money supply steadily rose till November, there being a slight fall in the following month. At the end of 1955 money supply was 12-1 per cent higher than at the end of 1954.

72. Of the increase in total money supply during 1955 demand deposits and currency in circulation rose almost in the same proportion, 11-9 per cent and 12 -5 per cent respectively. This is in marked contrast to 1954, when demand deposits rose 25 -2 per cent while the increase in currency circulation was only 1 -9 per cent.

74. Commercial Banks.—The main changes in the commercial banks' assets and liabilities position in 1955 are summarised below :—

(a) Total deposit liabilities rose by Rs. 115 -2 million (14 -5 per cent) to Rs. 910 -8

million Government deposits rising from Rs. 53 -0 million to Rs. 73 -8 million, and private deposits from Rs. 737 -0 million to Rs. 827 -5 million. Total demand deposits increased by Rs. 96 -4 million and time and savings by Rs. 18 -8 million. Unlike in 1954, the proportionate increase for each was about the same, 14 -9 per cent and 12 -8 per cent respec­tively ; in 1954 the percentage increase in demand deposits was much less than that in time and savings deposits.

(b) Bank cash, comprising till money and balances with the Central Bank

rose by Rs. 38 -2 million (29 -0 per cent). The ratio of cash to total deposits thus increased from 16 -6 per cent to 18 -8 per cent.

(c) Foreign balances, including unmatured export bills rose by Rs. 92 -2 million.

( 20 )

(d) Credit to the private sector, that is, the sum of loans, overdrafts, import

and export bills, increased by Rs. 17 -8 million (5 -8 per cent), almost the entire increase being shared about equally by export bills and loans.

(e) Credit to Government decreased by Rs. 26 -4 million. This was the result

of an increase of Rs. 27 -1 million in commercial bank holdings of Government securities and a decrease of Rs. 53 -4 million in treasury bill holdings.

(/) Total liquid assets rose by Rs. 75 -8 million (20 -2 per cent) to Rs. 451 -3 million.

(g) Excess reserves rose by Rs. 22 -5 million over the level in December, 1954, to Rs. 55 -7 million in December, 1955. The figure of Rs. 72 -9 million recorded in September was the highest for two years.

Public Finance

76. Government Accounts.—Government's accounts for the financial year 1954-55 as summarised in the table on page 21 show the following important features :—

(i) Government had a net cash operating surplus of Rs. 127 -6 million. This is the biggest surplus ever recorded.

(ii) The surplus was mainly due to higher revenue. Total revenue at Rs. 1,158-6 million, which was also a record, was largely the result of high export duty collections on tea. Revenue from income tax, estate duty and stamps and from excise and salt was lower than in the previous year.

(iii) Current expenditure as indicated roughly by the expenditure chargeable

to revenue too increased. The increase was due mainly to higher expenditure on wages and salaries as a result of the revision of salaries of public servants in April, 1955.

(iv) Loan and loan fund expenditure has remained roughly around Rs. 200

million annually during the last four financial years, 1953-54 excepted.

(v) As in the previous year Government's borrowing and lending operations

resulted in a net payment of cash which was financed from the surplus. The balance of the surplus after meeting this net payment contributed to the increase in Government's cash balances which rose for the first time after 1950-51.

77. Capital Expenditure.—The following table shows how total budgetary and extra-budgetary capital expenditures were financed. In 1954-55 even though the level of capital expenditure was higher than in the previous year, as in the previous year the current account surplus (i.e. the excess of revenue over non-capital expendi­ture) exceeded total capital expenditure.

Total net debt rose by Rs. 13 -4 million as compared with a decline of Rs. 108 -3 million in 1954. The rise was due to an increase in funded debt, both domestic and foreign, which more than offset the decline in the floating debt. Total net debt at Rs. 898 -4 million at the end of 1955 was 77 -5 per cent of Government revenue during 1954-55.

79. Funded Debt.—Gross funded debt increased by Rs. 76 -0 million and net funded debt by Rs. 68 -4 million. The increase in the gross funded debt in 1955 was the result of (a) the withdrawal of Rs. 8 -9 million from the I.B.R.D. under the Loan Agreement signed in June, 1954, and (b) the rupee loan transactions undertaken in March and December.

80. In March a loan for Rs. 75 million carrying 2£ per cent and maturing in 1960-62 was issued partly for cash and partly in conversion of the Rs. 40 million If per cent Loan 1955 which matured later in December. Subscriptions in cash amounted to Rs. 47 -2 million and the balance Rs. 27 -8 million was paid for by surrender of the If per cent stock. The unconverted part of the loan was repaid in December.

81. In December two loans were issued at par ; one for Rs. 25 -4 million at 2 J per cent and maturing in 1958 and the other for Rs. 24-6 million at 3J per cent and maturing between 1975 and 1980. Holders of the Rs. 25 -4 million 3 per cent Loan maturing in February, 1956, were allowed to offer their holdings for conversion into an equal nominal amount of the new 2J per cent Loan 1958. Both loans were over-subscribed. Conversions amounted to Rs. 17-9 million and cash to Rs. 32 -1 million. The stock which was surrendered in conversion has been regarded as finally redeemed as from the time of the conversion.

82. The three loans issued during 1955 were allotted as shown on the following page.

83. Sinking Funds.—The value of sinking funds established for the redemption of public debt wasRs. 206 -6 million at the end of 1955 as compared with Rs. 199-0 million at the end of 1954. The two rupee loans repaid during the year did not have sinking funds for their redemption (and, therefore, were repaid from revenue). The increase in the value of the sinking funds was due to the contributions to them from revenue and the accrual of interest on their investments, offset partly by the depreciation in value of their sterling investments.

84. Floating Debt.—Floating debt declined by Rs. 55 -0 million, the entire decline being in treasury bills. Advances from the Central Bank and loans from semi-Government institutions, which had both been fully repaid in the previous year, remained nil throughout 1955. The proportion of floating debt to total debt decreased further during the year.

85. Prices and Yields of Government Securities.—The variations in the treasury bill rate and in the prices and yields of selected Government securities arc shown in tables 20 and 23 respectively.

86. In 1955 there was a general decline in the interest rates. The treasury bill rate fell from 0-87 per cent in December, 1954, to 0-75 per cent in December, 1955. The decline in the yields of medium and long-term securities was more marked. The yield on a 5-year stock fell 0 -51 per cent to 2 -42 per cent and the yield on a 19-year stock fell 0 -35 per cent to 3 -13 per cent.

88. Burrowing as Agent for Other Institutions.—The Central Bank made two issues of State Mortgage Bank debentures and one of National Housing deben­tures during the year. The three issues totalled Rs. 22 -0 million.

89. The State Mortgage Bank debentures were issued in August and October. The first issue was for Rs. 5 -0 million at 2f per cent with maturity dates of 1962-64 and the second was for Rs. 7 -0 million at 3 per cent with maturity dates of 1965-68.

91. The Rubber Iiepltmting Suljsidy Scheme.—The Rubber Replanting Subsidy Scheme which was introduced by Government in September, 1953, made considerable progress in 1955. During the year 27,847 acres of rubber were approved for replant­ing under the Scheme bringing the total acreage approved for replanting since tho inception of the Scheme to 54,094 acres. Of this, 26,247 acres have already been replanted. In 1955, Rs. 11 -6 million was paid out in replanting subsidies bringing the total amount spent up to the end of 1955 to Rs. 20 -5 million.

( 27 )

92. The Scheme, which is financed by a cess on the export of rubber, envi­sages the replanting of 150,000 acres of uneconomic rubber land with higher yielding varieties by 1960. When this area comes into bearing, Ceylon's annual rubber production is expected to increase by 46,000 tons or about 50 per cent of the current production.

93. The Six- Year Programme of Investment—The Six-Year Programme of Investment covers only the investment outlays of the public sector over the six-year period 1954-55 to 1959-60. It is not a comprehensive plan of economic develop­ment for the entire economy.

94. The functional distribution of the total expenditure of Its. 2,528 -8 million provided for in the Programme is shown below :—

Prices, Wages and Employment

96. Cost of Living.—Living costs as measured by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index declined 0 -6 per cent in 1955 compared with the average for the previous year. This was largely due to the reduction in the price Of rationed rice from 55 cents to 50 cents at the end of May, which brought down the index by about 1 -6 points. The movements in the index and its three component groups are given in the following table :

* From corresponding period of 1954.

97. Wages.—There was little movement in the wage rates of plantation workers during the year. But compared with the average for the previous year, the money wages of tea and rubber estate workers were 3 -8 per cent higher in 1955 reflecting the increase in basic rates which came into force in August, 1954. Their real wages were 4 -3 per cent higher on account of lower living costs. In the other Wages Boards trades there was little change in wage rates. Wages of Government unskilled workers were 4 -7 per cent higher owing to an increase in wage rates in April of tho year under review resulting in a 5 per cent rise in real wages.

98. Employment.—Data on the number of registrants at the employment exchanges are given below :—

Period Number Index

1938 16,480 100 1951 52,707 320 1952 53,023 322 1953 51,546 313 1954 63,304 384 1955 1st quarter 67,357 409 2nd „ 65,756 399 3rd „ 69,174 420 4th „ 71,010 431

The figures of registrants include both unemployed and those seeking better employ­ment. The significance of the data is further limited by the fact that, in general, workers in the estate and rural sectors make little vise of the exchanges.

100. Tlic gross national product for 1955 is estimated to be Rs. 5,1.00 million, an increase of (5 -8 nor cent over the previous year. The main factors responsible for this increase were :—(a) higher average export prices ; (b) higher volumes of pro­duction of tea and coconuts ; and (c) an increase in the output of paddy.

Balance of Payments and External Assets

101. Ceylon's balance of payments, as estimated for 1955, Indicated a surplus of Rs. 317 -6 million as compared with the surplus of Rs. 305 -4 million in 1954. The surplus on the merchandise account has been the largest so far recorded. As com­pared with the previous year, there has been an improvement in the current account surplus despite a larger deficit in the invisibles' sector.

102. The net outflow on account of private remittances and migrants' transfers amounted to Rs. 76 -1 million in 1955, an increase of Rs. 9 -3 million over the previous year. This was wholly due to a higher volume of migrants' transfers resulting from the voluntary and compulsory repatriation of Indian nationals from Ceylon. Correspondingly there has been a substantial decline in private remittances to India.

103. Larger profits accruing to foreign companies operating in Ceylon, as a result of favourable prices prevailing for the major export commodities, particularly tea, led to an increased outflow in respect of dividends during the year. The net payments on investment income amounted to Rs. 59 -5 million as against Rs. 46 -6 million in 1954.

104. There was a deficit of Rs. 55 -1 million on the private capital account for 1955. Repatriation of foreign capital increased from Rs. 31 million in 1954 to Rs. 39 million in 1955, while the inflow of foreign capital for investment in Ceylon registered a marked decline. Substantial export earnings during the year enabled Sterling Companies to increase their holdings of foreign balances.
