    "text": "II. The Economic and Financial Situation 5. In the Annual Report of the Central Bank for 1954 mention was made of the remarkable economic and financial recovery which Ceylon achieved in that year. In general, 1955 was even a better year for the Ceylon economy than 1954. Because of the dominant role which foreign trade plays in Ceylon's economic activities, the terms of trade to a very great extent determine the level of real income. On the average the terms of trade showed about a 10 -0 per cent increase in 1955 over 1954. This improvement, together with the very favourable position as regards Govern\u00adment's finances, was mainly responsible for a record balance of payments surplus estimated at Rs. 317 -6 million. The external assets increased by Rs. 200 million.* In 1954 external assets increased by Rs. 288 million, but of this increase Rs. 63 -3 million represented the proceeds of a loan floated in London. In 1955 Government's external borrowings were limited to withdrawals of Rs. 8 -9 million from the I.B.R.D. loan negotiated in 1954. At the end of 1955 total external assets, at Rs. 1,155 million, were roughly equivalent to 79 per cent of the value of imports for that year.",
