    "text": "In the Annual Report of 1958 attention was drawn to the inherent limits imposed upon Central Banking by the specific conditions of an under-developed economy such as that of Ceylon. The two most significant conditions inhibiting central banking in Ceylon, as stressed in last year's Report, are the rudimentary nature of the money market and the fact that important factors determining the level of economic activity are outside the Central Bank's control. In 1959 the Govern\u00adment 's fiscal policy which is such a factor assumed a magnitude much greater than in previous years. The ability of the Central Bank to take effective monetary action in 1959 was severely limited by fiscal and other policies to which the Government was committed. There is, of course, much theoretical argument in many countries about the efficacy of monetary weapons to accomplish their aims solely, without the support of Government measures in other fields. In the case of Ceylon during 1959, owing to the unsettled political situation the Government was unable effectively to support the aims of monetary policy.",

These changes in the rubber duty, coming as they did towards the end of the year, did not have an appreciable impact on the Government's financial position in 1959. On the expendi\u00adture side, there was in fact an increase in expenditure chargeable to revenue of about Rs. 85 million. A substantial shortfall in loan fund expenditure amounting to Rs. 176 million, however, helped to reduce the budgetary gap although it was not a satisfactory feature from the point of view of economic growth.",

But this liquidity position was not such as to enable them to absorb any big issues of Government paper. This still left a substantial budgetary gap for which finance was required. In the absence of other sources of borrowing the Government bridged this gap by borrowing from the Central Bank. Since the unused credit avaitable under Section 88 of the Monetary Law Act which limits the outstanding amount of Central Bank advances to Government to 10 per cent of estimated revenue, (which in 1959 was about Rs. 133 million), was relatively small, the Government obtained the required funds from the Central Bank through the issue of Treasury bills. The Government used this device on a substantial scale in 1959. Over the year the volume of Treasury bills outstanding increased by Rs. 255 million; over the same period the Central Bank's holdings of Government Treasury bills increased by Rs. 191.5 million. The statutory limit on Treasury bills was raised twice by Parliament during the year from Rs. 200 million to Rs. 350 million in April and, when this was exhausted, from Rs. 300 million to Rs. 450 million in October. At the end of 1959 the outstanding volume of Treasury bills was Rs. 420 million and by the end of January 1960 the statutory limit of Rs. 450 million had been reached.",

The expansion of demand arose from both the increased direct expenditure of Government on goods and services and indirectly through the resultant increase in private incomes. It is difficult to gauge the precise extent to which the domestic supply situation responded to the increased demand owing to the absence of adequate statistical data. On the other hand, however, the increased demand generated by Government clearly led to a substantial rise in the volume of imports. The volume of imports in 1959 was the largest on record. Consequently there was a substantial decline in external assets in spite of an improvement in export receipts. Over the year the total value of Ceylon's external assets declined by Rs. 194.5 million.",

However, the unsettled political conditions that prevailed between the end of September 1959 and the end of November 1959 rendered such positive action unattainable. In the meanwhile, in spite of a loan of Rs. 25 million floated in October 1959, the Treasury had to finance its expenditures increasingly by resort to three months' Treasury Bills . despite the fact that no significant tenders were forthcoming to absorb these additional issues of Treasury Bills, let alone the repayment of outstanding Treasury Bills as they fell due fortnightly. On December 15, 1959 the Treasury Bills rate rose to 2.03%, and on December 16, 1959, the Monetary Board taking account of the economic and financial situation, raised the Bank rate from 2\\% to 3%. The Monetary Board had also in hand suggestions for floating a loan and certain other monetary measures of a selective nature.
