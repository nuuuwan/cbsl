International Monetary Developments.—During 1959 Ceylon's quota in the Inter­national Monetary Fund was increased by $30 million, 25 percent of which was paid in gold. The increase became effective in September, 1959 and Ceylon's quota in the Fund at present is $45 million. As far as Ceylon is concerned the importance in the enhanced quota lies in the fact that it provides for an added line of reserves against payments difficulties that may arise from possible swings in our balance of payments.

In the international sphere an overall increase in quotas would enable the Fund to have a greater flexibility of action and assure members of support within a wider range of normal drawings and also provide the Fund with additional gold reserves. The increase in international liquidity resulting therefrom is certainly a welcome step in meeting some of the pressing problems of the member countries and so sustaining international economic activity.

Pursuant to an increase in Ceylon's quota in the International Monetary Fund, Ceylon's subscription to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Develop­ment was increased to $60 million.
