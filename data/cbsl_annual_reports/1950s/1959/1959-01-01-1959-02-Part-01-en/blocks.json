This drop in the paddy crop of Yala was mainly because the acreage harvested in 1959 was less by approximately 60,000 acres, due to less favour\u00adable weather conditions. That production was almost as high as the previous year despite the lower Yala crop may be attributed to increased use of fertilisers and im\u00adproved techniques of cultivation.",

The average price level of imports fell by 1 per cent. Some of these increases in imports e.g. in rice and flour, resulted from government policy of accumu\u00adlating stocks of foodstuffs. Other increases e.g., of cement and fertilizers, were due to the need to replenish stocks which had dropped to abnormally low levels during he previous year owing to difficulties in the Port of Colombo. Again, there was an increase in the imports of certain types of transport and other equipment due to replacements and improvements in the road transport system. There were also marked increases in the imports of consumer goods arising in part from the expansion of incomes generated by the expenditure of government. This factor will be dis\u00adcussed below. The expansion by 35 per cent in the volume of imports of capital goods in 1959 follows upon a period of only moderate increases in the volume of these imports. Over the five year period ending in 1959, the average annual rate of increase was 8.8 per cent. Hence the sharp increase in the imports of capital goods in 1959 merely served to make up for smaller increases in the previous years.",

As already stated earlier, the average f:o.b. price of tea fell slightly in 1959.",

In value terms exports fell by Rs. 57 million (6 per cent). There was a fall of Rs. 85 million in exports to the United Kingdom, which purchased less tea, rubber and desiccated coconut in 1959. The value of imports from the Sterling Area, however, rose by about 23 per cent, since Ceylon purchased more food (particularly rice and flour), petroleum, chemicals, vehicles and iron and steel. As a consequence, the share of the Sterling Area in Ceylon's import trade rose by a little under 3 per cent in value. Ceylon incurred a deficit of Rs. 178 million in her trade with this area in 1959, thus reverting to a pattern that obtained prior to 1954.",

This re\u00adpresents a small improvement as compared with 1958 but is about 27 per cent below the average surplus in the past five years. Exports rose in value by 16 per cent on account of increases in the volumes of rubber and cocount products; tea exports, however, remained unchanged in both volume and value. The favourable movement in the value of exports to the Dollar Area in 1959 was largely brought about by the United States purchasing greater quantities of rubber. However, Ceylon's imports from the Dollar Area rose by more than 25 per cent in 1959. The increase was concentrated upon food items, particularly of rice and flour and dairy products. A major proportion of rice and flour and also some dairy products were received from the United States of America under special assistance programmes.",

In the early years of the postwar period Ceylon enjoyed a consistent trade surplus with this Area. Since 1956, however, there has been a tendency for Ceylon to incur a small deficit each year due in part to a fall in the value of exports. In 1959, however, Ceylon achieved a small surplus of Rs. 17 million in her trade with the European Economic Community. Exports rose in value by about 41 per cent showing increases in rubber and coconut oil. The increase in earnings of the latter commodity constitut\u00aded 64 per cent of the increase in the value of exports. E. E. C. countries that increased their purchases from Ceylon in 1959 were Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. Ceylon's imports from the Community rose by about Rs. 26 million (or 16 per cent) in 1959.

The values of each of the aggregates of exports and imports were fixed at Rs. 94.6 million. A separate Schedule to the Protocol provided",

Rice and textiles have been the main components of imports in Ceylon's trade with China. As compared with 1958, about 12 per cent more rice was imported in 1959, but since unit import prices were cheaper, total expenditure on rice rose only by about Rs. 6 million. The value of textiles imported from China in 1959 doubled to Rs. 9 million as compared with 1958. Imports of iron and steel also increased fractionally in value. A variety of other imports from China comprised chiefly, cement electrical goods and machinery.",

The export food group index rose by 13.4 per cent while the import food group declined by 1.3 per cent, during 1959. The rise in the export food group index was mainly the result of an increase in the prices of coconut products caused by higher export prices. The decline in the group index for imported food in 1959 was only a reflection of the reduction in the price of ration\u00aded rice by five cents in mid 1958. Whilst there was no change in the price of flour or sugar during the period, and the price index for \"other imported food\" rose, the index for ' 'all imported food'' fell.
