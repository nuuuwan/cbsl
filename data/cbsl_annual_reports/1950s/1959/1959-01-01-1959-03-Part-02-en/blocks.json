Disputes about working conditions accounted for 30.2* per cent of strikes while dismissal or loss of work and wage disputes, other than for increases accounted for 18.2* per cent and 16.1* per cent of strikes respectively.

In 1959, however, demand deposits increased by Rs. 65.8 million or 12.0 per cent while currency rose by only Rs. 35.2 million or 6.6 per cent. Consequently the ratio of currency to money supply fell slightly from 49.2 per cent in 1958 to 48.0 per cent in 1959. Despite this fall in the ratio, however, currency held by the public was at a higher level than in previous years. It is likely that the effects of some of the factors responsible for the rise in currency circulation \u2022 in 1958 continued in 1959 also, e.g. increase in money wages, increased amount of paddy sold by the cultivators to the Government and the holding of assets in liquid form.",

Whereas in the previous year the average monthly deposits fell, in 1959 they rose from Rs. 926 million to Rs. 955 million. This rise was caused by the increase in time and savings deposits from a monthly average of Rs. 263 million in 1958 to Rs. 300 million in 1959. Demand deposits, on the other hand, fell from a monthly average of Rs. 661 million to Rs. 655 million in this period. While the ratio of time and savings deposits to total deposits rose from a monthly average of 28.4 per cent in 1958 to 31.4 per cent in 1959, that of demand deposits fell from 71.6 per cent to 68.6 percent. It should also be noted that inter-bank borrowing remained at a high level in 1959 although it declined slightly from a monthly average of Rs. 35.6 million in 1958 to Rs. 34.9 million in 1959. This reflected the tight money conditions that prevailed throughout the year 1959.",

The rise of Rs. 10.9 million in savings deposits consisted almost entirely of deposits of individuals who held as much as 93 per cent of total sayings deposits. In the case of demand deposits the small increase of Rs. 8.2 million related principally to those of traders and individuals. The cause of the rise in time deposits of tea plantations might have been the retention of undistributed profits in liquid form without ploughing them back owing to unsettled conditions. The increase in savings deposits of individuals reflects the general rise in money incomes. In the case of government corporations the rise in time deposits consisted, very likely, of temporary deposits of money received from Government pending disbursement.",

The maximum amount of a loan granted at present is Rs. 100,000 except in cases where the loan is applied for \"developmentpurposes\". The fall in the amount of loans granted during 1958-59 was due to this policy of placing an upper limit on the amount of a loan as was also the case in the previous year. Debentures issued by the Bank during 1958-59 amounted to Rs. 7.0 million. In late 1959, the Bank increased its rate of interest on loans from A\\ per cent to 5 per cent. Loans sanctioned after December 22, 1959, were charged at the new rate. /with effect from 28th December, the Bank of Ceylon increased its roTes of interest paid on fixed deposits thereby bringing them into line with the rates of other major banks.",

The actual deficit has, however, fallen short of the originally planned deficit of Rs. 496.0 million by Rs. 82.6 million. The difference between the actual deficit and the originally estimated deficit is largely due to a shortfall of Rs. 172 million in loan fund expenditure, which represents the preponderant part of Government's capital expenditure, offset by an increase of Rs. 85.2 million in expenditure chargeable to revenue, which is substantially current expenditure. Thus, in relation to the original budget estimates for 1958/59, actual Government expenditure involved a substantial shift from capital formation to current consumption. The aggregate of Government revenue has, however, conformed to the original budget estimate.",

The increase in import duties is attributable to the large increase in imports as well as the higher duties introduced by the 1958/59 budget.",

The new tax consisted of a specific export duty of 35 cts. per lb. plus an ad valorem rate applicable to the excess of the Colombo Auction price above Re. 1.85 per lb. The ad valorem rate was 50 per cent of the excess price with an upper limit of 70 cts. per lb. Thus there would be no extra tax on any price excess above Rs. 3.25 per lb.",

This has mainly been due to increased private savings made available to Government through institu\u00adtional sources viz., savings institutions, insurance companies and trust, provident and pension funds. Purchases of Government securities, including Treasury bills, by these three institutional savers have increased from Rs. 18.1 million in 1957/58 to Rs. 76.9 million in 1958/59. Other private investors, mainly commercial companies, who reduced their holdings of Government stock by Rs. 5.3 million in 1957/58 made a net contribution of Rs. 17.5 million in 1958/59. The increased purchases of Gov-vernment stock by the non-bank sector in general reflects, in large measure, the in\u00adcreased money incomes in the private sector arising from Government's expansionary fiscal policy in the recent past and, perhaps, the improvement in export earnings since 1956.

In contrast to 1958 when the full impact of the balance of payments deficit was not re\u00adflected in the fall in Ceylon's external assets, but was cushioned to a large extent by an increase in Ceylon's liabilities accruing from operations under the bilateral agreements, the sizeable balance of payments deficit in 1959 was largely financed by drawing on the external reserves. A special item of expenditure during the year was the payment of $7.5 million (Rs. 35.7 million) which represents the 25 per cent sub\u00adscription due on account of Ceylon's enhanced quota in the International Monetary Fund.",

This was followed by a decline of Rs. 73.6 million in the third quarter and an even larger decline of Rs. 76.5 million in the fourth quarter 1959.

If present trends were to continue, a very large part of the balance of payments deficit will in the absence of other impor\u00adtant sources have to be financed by drawing on the depleted external reserves. More\u00adover, with continuing budget deficits and an active implementation of the Ten Year Plan, the pressure on the external assets is likely to increase and the position further weakened. The present level of external assets is not commensurate with the exisiting rate of demand on foreign exchange and even less so with the steady and-increasing rate of expenditure likely in the period ahead. Further measures are necessary to arrest any serious decline in our foreign reserves and their future use certainly calls for caution.",
