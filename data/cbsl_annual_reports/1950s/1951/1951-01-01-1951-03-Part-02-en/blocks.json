The value of Ceylon's rubber sales to .the United States -was Rs. 29-4 million in December, 1950, and Rs. 28 - 3 million in January, 1951 ; but it fell to Rs. 5-9 million by April, and reached a low of Rs. 2-5 million in September. This fall in earnings from rubber followed the action taken on 28 December, 1950, by the United States Government when it made an officia^ purchasing agency, the' General Services Administration, the sole importer of natural rubber into that country. The result was to eliminate competitive bidding in world markets by' private American importers. The: Administration immediately reduced the total volume of American buying of natural rubber below the high level that had existed in the last half of 1950. Prices fell steadily in Singapore and Colombo from March through July. Whatever the reason may be, the Administration reduced its buying in Ceylon .by a much larger proportion than it reduced its total buying. The physical volume of Ceylon rubber purchased by the United States in the second and third quarters of 1951 was 80 per cent below that purchased in the third and fourth quarters of 1950. For Ceylon the reversion to private American trading in rubber, announced in December, 1951, was obviously most welcome, but the restrictions on the use of natural rubber still in force in the United States Continue -to handicap natural rubber in its competition with synthetic.",
