The export group fell generally through the,first seven months of 1950 and then rose markedly because of the Korean War. The rise continued into 1951 and reached a peak in February. Since then the index has dropped back considerably. By the end of the year it was 15 per cent below its level at the end of 1950, and in January, 1952, it was 21 per cent below its level in January, 1951. The domestic group, on the other hand, showed a continuous rise throughout the year, and by December was 12 per cent higher than it had been in December, 1950. The import group also rose steadily, although its percentage increases over the previous year have not been quite so great as those for the domestic group.",

    "text": "34. Contraction of Commercial Bank Credit to Government.\u2014For the Central Bank the virtually balanced budget for 1951 was a factor of great significance since it enabled the Bank to pursue other policies effectively. First, the Bank did not have to depend upon creation of bank credit for financing a budget deficit. Instead, Government finances were managed in such a way as actually to destroy bank credit previously extended to Government. This was done by borrowing on long-term from the public and using the proceeds to repay the short-term debt held by com\u00admercial banks. A Rs. 60 million long-term loan, which the Central Bank asked commercial banks not to subscribe to, was opened on August 1. The loan was fully subscribed in a period of 9 | weeks by non-bank investors. At the same time, the total of treasury bills outstanding was reduced from Rs. 75 million in May to Rs. 15 million by October, where it stood at the end of the year. As a result, commercial bank holdings of Government securities and treasury bills together fell from a high of Rs. 286 \u2022 9 million at the end of May to a low of Rs. 232 \u2022 7 million at the end of November\u2014a decline of approximately Rs. 54 million. This reduc\u00adtion of holdings of. Government paper by banks helped to contract the money supply after May, especially because banks were not expanding credit to private borrowers to nearly the extent their reserve positions would have allowed.",

In fact, the retention of balances pverseas, especially in London, was actually encouraged by the Central Bank's readiness to purchase sterling up to six months forward at a shilling and six pence to the rupee, the spot rate, in any amount at any time. Through almost all of 1951 the Central Bank continued this policy. But at the end of December the Bank concluded that the worst of the monetary inflation had run its course, and that it was now more important to emphasize the long-run policy- of stimulating the commercial banks to extend more domestic credit, for the benefit of domestic production, than to continue the short-run anti-inflationary policy of enabling banks to lend overseas. Hence the Bank altered its attitude toward foreign balances of commercial' banks. Forward exchange rates were increased; the commercial banks were informed that the Central Bank would fix working balances in sterling for each bank, and that it would thereafter refuse to purchase sterling forward from any bank whose actual balance in sterling exceeded the working balance limit. The change of policy was implemented in January, 1952. The new forward exchange' arrangements should reduce the forward purchase commitments of the Central Bank, encourage the commercial banks to bring their excess overseas balances to Ceylon, and thus induce them to find more loan and investment oppor\u00adtunities within the Ceylon economy.",

From December, 1950, to December, 1951, bank extension of private credit in one form or another increased only by about Rs. 76 million. Much of this increase can be accounted for by the necessity for financing imports and exports at higher prices.

So far as the Bank knows, in no other country in the world was a basic foodstuff subsidised to the same degree as rice in Ceylon.

Before unlimited sales of off-ration imported rice were begun, there was a very wide gap between the price of 25 cents a measure for rationed rice and that of almost a rupee for \" country \" rice. The immediate effect of the measure, which was introduced on 23 April, 1951, was to bring, down the retail price of \" country \" rice, the market for which was completely free, very close to the price of imported rice. From 23 April to 10 November co-operative societies sold this off-ration imported rice at 68 cents a measure, and thereafter till the end of the year at 78 cents a measure. The rise in November was due to higher import cost. As the world price of rice rose, the price to the consumer had necessarily to be raised. But fortunately Ceylon has had good crops, and Government was able, as the year progressed, to purchase more \" country \" rice under the guaranteed price scheme for distribution off the ration and to reduce its purchases of imported rice.",
