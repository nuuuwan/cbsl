    "text": "the peak period of the Korean boom, and income both before and after has been lower. Also the Burma figures must be rising with higher prices for rice. Further\u00admore, in any such international comparisons there is a margin of inevitable haze, due partly to varying accuracy and completeness of the national data and vary\u00ading decisions by the compiling statisticians on borderline matters; and partly to the economic implication of various climates, patterns of consumption, and patterns of culture. A given \"value,\" for example, of rice or of housing, means something appreciably different in Japan's economy from what it does in Ceylon's. These qualms, as they variously apply to different countries, weaken the sharpness of the comparisons but do not destroy their significance.",
