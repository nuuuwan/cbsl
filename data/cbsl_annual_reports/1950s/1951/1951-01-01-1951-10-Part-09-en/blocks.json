A consider\u00adable loss of external assets might have been expected affer March, simply because people ordinarily spend freely out of any increase in incomes. In addition, export prices weakened, import and exchange controls were relaxed, and some capital flowed out as many foreign investors took the opportunity to repatriate their invest\u00adments on relatively favourable terms. The actual loss of assets from March until the end of the year, however, was only Rs. 55 million, and in January, 1952, assets rose by Rs. 23 million, reducing even this loss. Thus Ceylon avoided the heavy losses of reserves suffered during this same period by other members of the Sterling Area, losses that precipitated the sterling crisis of late 1951 and early 1952.",
