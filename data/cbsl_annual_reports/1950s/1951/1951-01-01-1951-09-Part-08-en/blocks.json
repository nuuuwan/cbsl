Second, \" deposits,\" which had previously been included in group (1), now appear in (2). These deposits, being monies deposited by the public with the Government, in' effect, constitute borrow\u00adings of the Government. Third, the item \"miscellaneous,\" (1) (vii), as it now stands excludes \" miscellaneous funds,\" (2) (i) (b), which are regarded as borrow\u00adings for the same reason that \" deposits \" are so regarded. Fourth, group (2) has been sub-divided to show market borrowing and lending operations separately from non-market (or administrative) operations.",

These 'assets rose by Rs. 358 million in the nine months following the outbreak of the Korean War, that is, from June, 1950 to March, 1951> the total reaching a high point of Rs. 1,240 million. A consider\u00adable loss of external assets might have been expected affer March, simply because people ordinarily spend freely out of any increase in incomes. In addition, export prices weakened, import and exchange controls were relaxed, and some capital flowed out as many foreign investors took the opportunity to repatriate their invest\u00adments on relatively favourable terms. The actual loss of assets from March until the end of the year, however, was only Rs. 55 million, and in January, 1952, assets rose by Rs. 23 million, reducing even this loss. Thus Ceylon avoided the heavy losses of reserves suffered during this same period by other members of the Sterling Area, losses that precipitated the sterling crisis of late 1951 and early 1952.",

Post Office Savings Bank deposits were probably the most popular form of savings, and increased at the rate of almost Rs. 4 million per month. There were increases in the savings deposits of the Ceylon Savings Bank and the commercial banks, in premiums collected by insurance companies, in corporate savings, and in investments in Government securities by individuals. Finally, people were simply willing to hold more in the form of currency or demand deposits than they needed for transactions purposes, which means in effect that they were willing to save without earning interest.",
