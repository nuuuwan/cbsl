Every loan granted to a local authority is subject to the limits of the borrowing powers of that authority under any other Act or Ordinance regulating its powers and duties. Under section 12C, no loan can be granted to the local authority unless its repayment is secured by the primary mortgage of the proceeds of any rates or taxes which that authority is by law authorised to impose. Prior to the amendment local authorities were unable to obtain loans from the Housing Loans Board.",
