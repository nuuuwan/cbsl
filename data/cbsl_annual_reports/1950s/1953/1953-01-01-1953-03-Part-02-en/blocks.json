The fact that the more favourable conditions of external trade did not produce a surplus on merchandise account to meet the.deficit on invisibles must be ascribed mainly to the continued high level of imports. The demand for imported goods was still swollen as a result of Government spending in excess of revenues and of borrowings from domestic savings. This spending, which had to be financed by expanding credit, increased cash in the hands of the public and, by strengthening the demand for goods including imported goods, contributed to the fall of external assets. The 1952 Annual Report observed : \" A loss of external assets automatically exerts a corrective effect on an economy. The domestic quantity of money tends to fall by the amount of the loss as domestic funds are used in purchasing foreign exchange from the banking system to meet net outpayments.\" The money supply contracted in 1953 but by only one half of the decline in external banking assets. This was nevertheless a higher proportion than in-1952 when the money supply contracted by less than a third of the fall in external banking assets. The main reason was that the expansion of credit to Government, although substantial, was smaller than in 1952.",

The roots of the crisis which developed in 1953, however, lay deep in the policies of previous years. For several years back, capital outlays including expenditures on loan works and provision of working funds for state enterprises had exceeded the financial resources made available to Govern\u00adment from current revenue surpluses and from loans financed out of both domestic savings and creation of bank credit. The resulting deficiencies had been met by running down rupee cash accumulated mostly during the war years. From the financial year 1946-47, when the first of the series of annual deficits appeared, up to the financial year 1952-53, Government depleted its rupee cash by an amount nearly equal to the balances it had accumulated from the financial year 1939-40 up to 1945-46, the first year after the war. Capital expenditures on loan works rose almost steadily each year from Rs. 32 million in 1946-47 to Rs. 221 million in 1952-53. In aggregate, such expenditures amounted to Rs. 951 million which was almost equal to the total of budget deficits in the sarue period. While Government was drawing on accumulated balances to finance its deficits, its current expenditure policies were favouring consumption so much that the outlay on food subsidies amounted to four-fifths of the expenditure on loan works.",

With deficit financing on this scale, a loss of external assets would have been unavoidable except under the most unusually favourable circumstances such as those which prevailed temporarily in the period of the Korean War boom in 1950 and 1951, when external assets nearly regained their peak 1945 level. Except during these two years Ceylon lost external assets almost continuously from 1946. Thus, it was not by mere coincidence that the loss of external assets happened to correspond with the series of post-war annual Government deficits.",

The prices of Ceylon's export and import goods are determined externally and are little affected by changes in the internal monetary situation. Although the price index of commodities domestically produced and consumed fell on the average very slightly in 1953, the trend was distinctly downward in the second half of the year. During the first half when the money supply was almost constant, domestic prices did not show any pronounced tendency to fall. In fact; at one stage (May and June), the index rose seasonally. From July onward it fell steadily, reaching 96 -7 at the end of the year as compared with 100 -6 at the beginning of the year, thus reflecting the impact on the domestic price level of a contracting money supply as the budget deficit narrowed. In spite of the fall in the domestic group, the consumer's price index as a whole rose to 101 -6 in 1953 as against 100 in 1952. The reason was that the price levels of both the export group and the import group were higher. The former rose by 17 -1 per cent and the latter by 2 -5 per cent. Towards the end of the year, however, the import group showed a falling trend, reaching a low point of 104 -1 in December as against a peak of 112 -3 in August.",

It was a monetary problem only in the sense that the financing of the Government deficit through credit expansion caused the money supply to become excessive in relation to the terms of trade and the level of export income. Some fall of external assets was to be expected with the worsening of the terms of trade after the collapse of the Korean War boom. But it would be a mistake to exaggerate the importance of the worsening and regard it as the principal reason for Ceylon's difficulties. The years 1950 and 1951 were exceptional and Ceylon was then enjoying the benefits of a boom. By contrast the 1953 terms of trade were consider\u00adably better than those in 1952 or in the pre-Korean War years of 1948 and 1949",
