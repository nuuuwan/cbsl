extra costs of administration and may delay or interfere unduly with trade and other productive activities. Second, it inevitably gives rise to attempted evasion which may, if unchecked, lead to concealed losses of exchange, black market exchange rates and other undesirable features. Third, because some will always seek to exploit legal as well as illegal loopholes, there is a tendency for control to breed further controls. The simplification and relaxation of restrictions deserve attention as soon as circumstances permit.

54. Throughout the year the Central Bank continued to enjoy the active support and co-operation of the commercial banks in its task of enforcing exchange control.

58. Prices of coconut products, as measured by their price index; averaged 20 per cent higher than in 1952. The increase in price more than offset the drop of 13 per cent in the quantities exported (reckoned in terms of nuts) with the result that the value of exports of coconut products improved by 6 per cent.

60. Food imports accounted for nearly half of the total value of imports in 1953. The volume of food imports was 7 per cent larger, but average prices were 5 per cent lower, than in 1952. Between 1952 and 1953 average c.i.f. prices per ton of rice fell from Rs. 823 to Rs. 801 ; flour from Rs. 585 to Rs. 570 ; and sugar from Rs. 654 to Rs. 495. Raw materials were 26 per cent larger in volume but their average price fell nearly 6 per cent. Under the manufactures group, both quantities and average prices of textile imports and other kinds of manufactures, as a group, declined, textiles by 11 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, and other manufac­tures by 8 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.

61. Pattern of Trade.—Table 25 gives a breakdown of foreign trade by signifi­cant regions and monetary areas. This table illustrates, in particular, that Ceylon is usually in deficit on merchandise account with the sterling area, and is in surplus with other currency groups, especially with the dollar and non-sterling E.P.U, areas,

Sterling area countries, as a group, remained the most important market for Ceylon's exports and imports. The trade deficit with this group declined to Rs.290 -4 million from Rs. 346 -4 million in 1952, i.e., by Rs. 56 million. The main reason for the decline was the reduction of rice purchases from Burma from 222,000 tons (Rs. 174 -7 million) to 141.000 tons (Rs. 118 -1 million).

63. Ceylon's trade surplus with the dollar area increased from Rs. 48-1 million in 1952 to Rs. 140 -4 million in 1953. The improvement in net receipts in spite of a sharp decrease in exports of rubber, which used to be a major dollar earner, was entirely due to the fall in imports, especially, of food, textiles and vehicles.

Imports consisted almost exclusively of rice and exports predominantly of rubber. The value of rice imports in 1953 rose to Rs. 203 million from Rs. 28 million in the previous year. The 1953 contract provided for the supply of 270,000 metric tons of rice.at an average f.o.b. price, ex China ports, of £54 per metric ton. Exports of rubber to China at 132 million pounds in 1953 (111 million pounds being against the 1953 contract) were twice as large as those in 1952, and represented 60 • 8 per cent of total rubber exports as against 31 • 7 per cent in 1952. In 1953, on the basis of an f.o.b. price of Rs. 1 -77 per pound for the top grades of sheet rubber, these shipments fetched a price substantially higher than the world price. Consequently Ceylon earned an estimated Rs. 95 million more in foreign exchange than it would have received at the prevailing world price.

Money and Banking

65. Money Supply.—The composition of the money supply appears in table. I The money supply which began to contract in 1952 fell further in 1953, especially in the second half of the year. It declined to Rs. 826 -8 million, or by 7 -7 per cent over the year as against 11-0 per cent in 1952.

Of the two constituents of the money supply, privately held demand deposits contracted more than currency in circulation, the former by 8 -9 per cent and the latter by 6 -0 per cent. The corresponding decreases in 1952 were 14 -3 per cent and 5 -5 per cent respectively. Thus, demand deposits declined proportionately much less, and currency in circulation slightly more, than in 1952.

66. The following table summarises the expansionary and contractionary factors contributing to the changes in the money supply in the past three calendar years :

67. Commercial Banks.—The main changes in the condition of the banking system during 1953 (table 4) are summarised below:

(a) Total demand deposits including inter-bank and Government deposits

contracted by Rs. 74 -4 million (12 -0 per cent) to Rs. 547 -5 million while fixed and savings deposits showed little change.

(b) Demand deposits held in Ceylon by banks abroad dropped from Rs. 35 -6

million to Rs. 11 -7 million primarily because certain balances previously built up were drawn upon to finance exports, especially to China.

(c) Bank cash (till money and balances with the Central Bank) fell by Rs. 64 -2

million or 41 -3 per cent. The ratio of cash to total deposits thus dropped during the year from 21 -5 per cent to 14-1 per cent and that to demand deposits from 25 -1 per cent to 16 -7 per cent.

(. 20 )

(d) The total volume of bank credit at Rs. 550 -6 million showed hardly any

change over the previous year. But within the total, an expansion of loans and advances to the private sector of Rs. 18-0 million* (8 -8 per cent) was approximately matched by a decrease of Rs. 18 -8 million (6 -2 per cent) in the holding of Government securities including treasury bills.

(e) Total liquid assets declined by Rs. 76 -4 million (23 -0 per cent) to Rs. 255 -5

million at the end of 1953.

68. The following table sets out the composition of liquid assets and certain significant asset-liability relationships of the commercial banking system :

(1) Treasury bills and Government securities. (2) Bills discounted (local and foreign), overdrafts and loans. (3) Exclusive of domestic inter-bank deposits.

The contraction of deposits in 1953 was mainly met by commercial banks reducing the volume of bank cash. Treasury bill investments which reached a low point in May and increased thereafter were Rs. 8 -5 million lower at the end of the year. Other Government securities were not mobilised in any important degree to meet the decline in deposits, except for a liquidation of Rs. 6 -3 million (net) in August when the 3 per cent National Loan matured.

69. A noteworthy feature was the ability of the commercial banks to meet the substantial contraction of their resources without restricting credit. They were, however, at times subject to increasing pressure for funds. Excess reserves (which were, of course, not evenly distributed) declined from Rs. 39 -6 million at the end of 1952 to Rs. 11-0 million in August, 1953, but rose sharply to Rs. 40 -5 million in the following month when reserve requirements were lowered to the statutory minimum.

•Excludes foreign bills outward but includes cash items in process of collection.

( 21 )

Thereafter excess reserves fell again, reaching a low point of Rs. 5 -9 million at the end of the year under the impact of the transfer of cash from the public to the Central Bank for the account of Government. At certain periods of the year, the banks also reduced their foreign balances to ease the tightness of money and even increased their temporary borrowings from banks abroad, which reached a peak of Rs. 17 -0 million in November, 1953, as against Rs. 5 -7 million at the end of 1952. The banks, moreover, had recourse to borrowing from the Central Bank, whose advances to them amounted to Rs. 4 -7 million in October, 1953 (there being none outstanding at the beginning of the year), and Rs. 3 -3 million at the end of the year.

Public Finance

70. Budget,—The Government accounts for the financial year 1952-53 which are summarised in table on page 22 disclose the following salient features :—

(a) Revenues were in excess of current expenditures ; and the surplus amounted

to Rs. 48 -1 million in contrast with the deficit of Rs. 50-6 million in 1951-52.

(b) Total revenues were almost fully maintained at the 1951-52 level but there

were important changes within the total: a decrease of Rs. 43 -4 million in customs duties was largely offset by increases of Rs. 11 -4 million in excise duties and Rs. 27 -5 million in income tax, estate duty, etc.

(c) Current expenditures showed a marked decrease mainly because food

subsidies met from revenues declined from RP. 247 -2 million in 1951-52 to Rs. 127 -0 million in 1952-53.

(d) Loan and loan fund expenditures which had been growing almost steadily

for several years past increased further to Rs. 220 -6 million in 1952-53 as follows :—

1947-48 1948-49 1949-50 1950-51 1951-52 1952-53

70-3 122 -5 155 -6 146 -7 203 0 220 -6

(e) Net receipts from borrowing operations reached the record total of Rs. 216 -5 million which, together with Rs. 15 -4 million withdrawn from cash balances, were used to finance the net cash operating deficit of Rs. 231 -9 million.

71. A new analysis of Government accounts, reclassifying receipts and pay­ments, for the period from the financial year 1947-48 to 1953-54 is given in table 17. This table illustrates in particular :—

(a) The important contribution of direct taxes to Government revenues.

(b) The major role of indirect taxes in the revenue structure ; and the relative

stability of import duties in contrast with the fluctuating yields of export duties.

(c) The significance ot "transfer payments." The decline in 1952-53 was

chiefly due to the reduction in food subsidy expenditure.

(d) The growth of capital expenditure particularly under " economic services."

72. The table below shows how capital expenditures were financed. The contribution of current account surpluses, i.e. the excess of Government revenues over current (or non-capital) outlays, to the financing of capital expenditures was noteworthy.

558 -8 811 -3 993 -3

The total net debt rose to Rs. 993 million by the end of 1953 mainly owing to a marked expansion of the floating debt. The net debt was still small in relation to the annual Government revenue, but the rate of increase of 22-4 per cent during the year, though less than that of 45-3 per cent in 1952, was excessive, having regard to the limited supply of domestic savings forthcoming for investment in Government loans, and to the heavy loss of external assets through creation of bank credit which the expansion of the public debt involved.

74. Funded Debt.—The increase in the funded debt in the calendar year 1953 -was primarily the combined result of (a) the repayment of two maturing loans, 3 | per cent Home Defence Loan on June 1, 1953, for Rs. 0 -8 million and 3 per cent National Loan on August 1, 1953, for Rs. 33 million, and (b) the issue of 3 per cent Loan 1956 and 3J per cent Loan 1959-61, both on August 1, 1953, for a total sum of Rs. 80 million.

75. The two new loans were issued partly to convert the 3 per cent National Loan maturing on August 1, 1953. They were fully subscribed in approximately four weeks as follows :—

The 3 per cent Loan 1956, being short dated, was largely supported by commercial banks, while the 3i per cent Loan 1959-61, with a medium term maturity, was especially favoured by institutional investors.

76. Floating Debt.—A further sharp increase in the floating debt was lecorded in 1953. The expansion of the treasury bill issue during the year is described in table 18. Central Bank advances to Government, month by month, appear in table 5. A special feature was the temporary accommodation which Government secured from semi-Government agencies, pending raising of loans in the market. The increased importance of the floating debt was particularly striking in relation to the total rupee debt, the ratio rising as high as 30 -4 per cent in 1953.

77. Prices and Yields of Government Securities.—As mentioned earlier, the rise in the treasury bill rate in effect set the pace for the advance in interest rates during 1953. Market quotations for Government securities began to weaken in March and April and declined markedly thereafter. By the beginning of June when the treasury bill rate had risen by a margin of 1 -13 per cent above the January level, the yield to redemption of long term securities maturing in 20 years rose by a margin of 0 -5 per cent. By September, when treasury bills had recorded a further rise of 0 -43 per cent, the yield on the same long term securities had increased by 0 -57 per cent. Thereafter, with the treasury bill rate remaining at 2 -48 per cent, medium and long term securities tended to strengthen. Market transactions were recorded at prices somewhat above the lowest levels reached during July to September, thus showing a small decline in yields.

78. A revised statement on prices and yields of four representative Govern­ment securities is given in table 21. It must be emphasized that the Colombo market for Government securities is narrow and is still in process of development. Dealing prices do not necessarily reflect that close correspondence of yields of related securities which an active market normally provides. However, the general pattern of prices and yields in the table reflects the market trends which prevailed during the year.

80. Cost of Living.—The Colombo Consumers' Price Index, described in the 1952 Annual Report, replaced with effect from January, 1953, the two previous indexes, the Colombo working class cost of living index and the estate labour cost of living index. As measured by the new index, the cost of living in 1953 was, on the average, 1 -6 per cent higher than in 1952. Major factors contributing to the behaviour of the index were : (i) changes in Government policy with regard to the rice subsidy, first, in July when the price of rationed rice and the amount of the ration were increased and, later, in October when the price was reduced ; (ii) tax increases in the budget which raised the cost of some items in the import and domestic groups ; (iii) improvement in the terms of trade which was reflected in lower prices of the import group and in higher prices of the export group ; and (iv) the contractionary influence of a declining money supply on the domestic group, referred to earlier.

82. Wages.—The movements in money wages and real wages of tea and rubber workers, which together constitute the most important single group of the occupied population, are shown in the table that follows. Money wages include basic wages and special allowances tied to changes in the cost of living. The average level of money wages of tea and rubber estate workers was higher in 1953, the minimum wage index rising by 1 -7 per cent; but real wages were virtually unchanged.

83. Available information on workers in other Wages Board industries, such as tea export, rubber export, engineering, coconut manufacturing and printing showed similar trends. For Government unskilled workers, however, the money wage index (1939 = 100) moved from an average of 540 in 1952 to 547 in January, 1953, and to 542 in the following month. From March onwards, the index remained at 547 because the special allowances were pegged at their January level.

' 84. Employment.—The only data available on unemployment are numbers • registered for employment at the employment exchanges. They are given in the following table :—

Registrants at Employment Exchanges

Period Number

1938 16,480 1949 69,732 1950 65,122 1951 52,707 1952 53,023 1953 1st Quarter 54,483 2nd Quarter 51,925 3rd Quarter 51,690 4th Quarter 51,546

The data cannot, however, be taken as an accurate measure of unemployment. First, many who already have some employment often register to improve their employment. Second, in general, workers in the estate and rural sectors make little use of the exchanges and many of them transform their unemployment into under-employment by occupying themselves partially in some independent work. The result is that unemployment and also under-employment among Ceylonese workers in estates and villages escape measurement.

National Income

85. The Department of Census and Statistics estimated the gross national product at Rs. 4,619 million for 1951 and Rs. 4,476 million for 1952. Provisional figures indicate an estimate for 1953 slightly below that for 1952. The value of production exported rose but the value of production domestically consumed fell. The physical output of coconut and paddy, the two most important commodities produced for the domestic market, declined largely because of adverse weather conditions, the former by some 5 per cent and the latter by some 8 per cent. In general, the prices of goods produced for home consumption fell.

86. An all-island survey of consumer incomes and expenditures was conducted by the Central Bank from April to June 1953. Out of a sample designed to be as representative as possible and covering 5,179 persons, 1,708 persons were found to be recipients of income (including transfer income). The distribution of their income was as follows :—

( 28 )

1,708 100 00 183,413 100 -00

Excluding transfer income, total personal income was reckoned at Rs. 173,430 for the sample. On this basis, assuming the population at the time of the survey at 8 -13 million and excluding the income of persons living in institutions such as hospitals and hotels, who were left out of the sample, aggregate personal income (the major component of national fncome) could be assessed at an annual rate of Rs. 3,267 million. This figure can be treated as a minimum estimate, since in surveys of this type understatement of income is not uncommon.

Balance of Payments and External Assets

87. Ceylon's balance of payments annually from 1951 to 1953 is summarised in table 22A. A classification for 1953 by quarters appears in table 22B, and by regions and monetary areas in table 22C.

88. The balance of payments for 1953, as estimated, disclosed a deficit of Rs. 221 -5 million on current account or approximately half of the corresponding deficit of Rs. 445 -6 million (revised) for 1952.

89. The net outflow of private remittances and migrants' transfers decreased substantially to Rs. 58 -8 million in 1953 from Rs. 103 -6 million in 1952 under the influence of tighter exchange control restrictions. Net expenditure on foreign travel was also lower at Rs. 36 -7 million as against Rs. 47 -7 million in 1952.

90. In contrast with the net capital inflow of Rs. 25 -1 million in 1952 there was a net outflow of Rs. 37 -4 million in 1953. This was mainly due to the repatriation of capital on a larger scale in 1953 and, in a lesser degree, to an increase in the overseas balances of businesses operating in Ceylon.

( 29 )

91. The overall deficit in the balance of payments, as measured by the change in the net external assets of official and banking institutions, was Rs. 198 -3 million. External assets fell altogether by Rs. 229 -7 million, of which Rs. 31 4 million were applied towards reducing rupee liabilities to non-residents.

V. Operations and Accounts of the Central Bank

92. Financial accounts of the Central Bank for the year 1953 are set out in table 6. The main changes in comparison with 1952 were :—

Rs. million Per cent

increase + ; decrease —

The ratio of the International Reserve to total demand liabilities declined further from 75 -8 per cent at the end of 1952 to 56 -4 per cent at the end of 1953.

93. The Central Bank's discount rate for treasury bills continued to be fixed in 1953 at l/8ofone per cent over the last average tender rate. As the average tender rate advanced, the discount rate moved up from l-045 per cent in January to 2-605 per cent in August, and remained approximately at this level up to December.

94. The Central Bank rate for advances to commercial banks (against the pledge of Government securities) was raised from 2J per cent to 3 per cent on July 23, 1953, at which level it remained unaltered for the rest of the year. The reserve ratio applicable to demand deposits of commercial banks was reduced from 14 per cent to 10 per cent with effect from September 11, 1953.

95. There was no change during 1953 in the Central Bank's spot and forward rates for sterling and the Indian rupee, which were :—

96. The Central Bank's rates for the U.S. dollar were changed from time to time (as shown in Appendix 1 B) in alignment with the movements in the sterling-dollar rate.
