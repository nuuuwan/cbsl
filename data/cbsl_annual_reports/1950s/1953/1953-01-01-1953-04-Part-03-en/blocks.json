The prices of Ceylon's export and import goods are determined externally and are little affected by changes in the internal monetary situation. Although the price index of commodities domestically produced and consumed fell on the average very slightly in 1953, the trend was distinctly downward in the second half of the year. During the first half when the money supply was almost constant, domestic prices did not show any pronounced tendency to fall. In fact; at one stage (May and June), the index rose seasonally. From July onward it fell steadily, reaching 96 -7 at the end of the year as compared with 100 -6 at the beginning of the year, thus reflecting the impact on the domestic price level of a contracting money supply as the budget deficit narrowed. In spite of the fall in the domestic group, the consumer's price index as a whole rose to 101 -6 in 1953 as against 100 in 1952. The reason was that the price levels of both the export group and the import group were higher. The former rose by 17 -1 per cent and the latter by 2 -5 per cent. Towards the end of the year, however, the import group showed a falling trend, reaching a low point of 104 -1 in December as against a peak of 112 -3 in August.",

It was a monetary problem only in the sense that the financing of the Government deficit through credit expansion caused the money supply to become excessive in relation to the terms of trade and the level of export income. Some fall of external assets was to be expected with the worsening of the terms of trade after the collapse of the Korean War boom. But it would be a mistake to exaggerate the importance of the worsening and regard it as the principal reason for Ceylon's difficulties. The years 1950 and 1951 were exceptional and Ceylon was then enjoying the benefits of a boom. By contrast the 1953 terms of trade were consider\u00adably better than those in 1952 or in the pre-Korean War years of 1948 and 1949",

To do this, they should not be allowed to fall below a minimum level; and this minimum must be set at a high figure because of Ceylon's heavy dependence on foreign trade. At the rate of drain in the first half of 1953, they would have disappeared in just over two years. Second, external assets act as a cushion to soften the impact of fluctuations of income on consumption. They can be built up when incomes are rising and allowed to drop when incomes are falling. But the level of consumption which Ceylon aims at maintaining in the face of falling income should not be so high as to cause external assets to drop below the minimum level. In 1952 and 1953, Ceylon maintained consumption at a much higher level than could be justified when incomes were substantially lower. The result was that the country sacrificed external assets which it could have put to better use.",

Savings Deposits.\u2014The upward trend of interest rates did not influence the policy of either the long-term lending institutions or the various savings institu\u00adtions during the year. The need for a new approach designed to stimulate small savings is a matter which will call for earnest attention in 1954. In 1953 savings deposits showed an unsatisfactory trend. Allowing for accrued interest, there was a net withdrawal of savings deposits in contrast to the substantial increases in earlier, years.",

Second, although short-term rates rose rapidly under the pressing need to enlarge the treasury bill issue, the maximum level reached was broadly in line with those in many other countries similar to, or closely connected with, Ceylon.

In subscribing to them an investor enters into a contract in which Government, for its part, undertakes not only to pay interest at regular intervals but also to repay the loan in full on a certain date. Between the date of issue and the date of redemption, Government securities, like any other marketable asset, may fluctuate in price according to the conditions prevailing. A recognition of this fact and a greater attention to market conditions on the part of many investing institutions and of private investors can only be beneficial to borrower and lender. Fourth, the higher rates paid in 1953 both on treasury bills and on the loans of August, 1953, undoubtedly stimulated subscriptions from non-banking sources on a scale far larger than would otherwise have been forthcoming,",

On the other, they should stimulate the supply of savings and bring about a better and more efficient allocation of the country's resources through some weeding out of marginal projects.

    "text": "49. Reserve Ratios.\u2014The contraction in the money supply in the first half of 1953 inevitably involved a reduction in the resources of the commercial banks. By July, 1953. it had become clear that the banks were nearing a point where they might be obliged to restrict their lending to the private sector. It was also evident that further pressure was likely to develop as Government's cash position improved under the new budget policy and Government became able to repay part of its indebtedness to the Central Bank out of revenue or out of borrowing from the public. With these factors in mind, the Central Bank reduced in September, 1953, the ratio of reserves, which the commercial banks had to maintain with the Central Bank, to 10 per cent of the commercial banks'demand deposits from 14 per cent, to which level it had been raised in January,, 1951. (The ratio for time deposits remained unchanged ar 5 per cent). This figure of 10 per cent is the minimum required under section 93 of the Monetary Law Act. The effect was to increase substantially the commercial banks' employable resources and to permit them in some degree to extend credit further to the private sector. The pressure of a falling money supply, however, forced the banks generally to pay close attention to their cash position ; and in the last quarter of 1953 there was a noticeably greater demand by them for short-term accommodation from the Central Bank.",
