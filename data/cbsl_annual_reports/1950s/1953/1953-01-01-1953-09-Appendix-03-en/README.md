* CHANGE IN SERIES

Source: Dept. of Census & Statistics;

N o t e : Ceylon charts of the cost o living, other than those of the Central Bank's 1951 Report, have been plotted on an arithmetic vertical scale, in which equal amounts of change were given equal space. This is plotted on a ratio o r logarithmic, vertical scale, in which equal percentages of change are given equal space.

The ratio scale implies an assumption ; that Ceylon is primarily interested in percentage changes in the cost of living, not in amounts of change. Hence it gives a truer impression of what has taken place in the movements of this index.

At every point in the chart the angles given to the right indicate the same per cent, per year changes.
