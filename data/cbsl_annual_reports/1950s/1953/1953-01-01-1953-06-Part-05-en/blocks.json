Income and Expenditure.\u2014The income of the Central Bank for the year amounted to Rs. 12,801,014 -59 and expenditure including allocations to reserves in terms of section 38 of the Monetary Law Act absorbed Rs. 10,801,014 -59. The net profit of the Bank was Rs. 2 million. As a result of the large increase in domestic assets of the Bank in 1953, caused by the expansion of Central Bank credit to Government, the capital accounts were below the minimum of 15 per cent of the difference between the total assets of the Bank and its International Reserve, prescribed by section 39 (b) of the Monetary Law Act. Accordingly, in terms of that section the net profit was carried to surplus.",
