As will be seen by reference to the table on page 5, the percentage increase in the cost of living exceeded ten per cent, in only one month, i.e. September, 1950. The increases in the money supply were much more pronounced. Even before the Bank opened there had been a series of months beginning with March, 1950, at the end of each of which the money supply had shown an increase of more than fifteen per cent, above the preceding year. Accordingly, the report to the Minister on the inflationary situation was one of the first major policy matters to engage the attention of the Board. The report was submitted on December 15, 1950, and contained an analysis of the inflation problem essentially along the same lines as that which follows.",

    "text": "8. As the chart shows, the increase in the money supply during 1950 was due to three principal factors. The first is the monetization of a portion of the surplus in Ceylon's balance of payments. This occurs through the purchase by either the com\u00admercial banks or the Currency Board (or, since August 28, by the Central Bank) of such excess foreign exchange as the Ceylon economy has been earning. Thus, when the banking system, during the period in which Ceylon's total receipts from abroad exceed payments abroad, purchases more foreign- exchange from either the public or the Govern\u00adment than it sells to them, the excess of foreign exchange purchased represents an addition to the money supply. According to Statement 1B and chart 2, Ceylon's external banking assets increased by Rs. 140'6 million from the end of December, 1949, to the end of December, 1950. Up to the end of September, 1950, the effect of the balance of payments upon the money supply was slightly deflationary. From October to December, 1950, however, it was very actively inflationary. The surplus in the balance of payments increased external banking assets in those three months by Rs. 147 \u2022 0 million.",

Depending upon whether credit has been expanded in favour of the Govern\u00admental or the private sector of the economy, such assets may be divided into two categories, namely, government securities (including treasury bills), and loans, over\u00addrafts, & c , extended to private enterprise. The commercial banks extended Rs. 67 \"1 million of credit to the Governmental sector and Rs. 60\" 5 million to the private sector of the economy, a total of Rs. 127 \u2022 6 million. In addition, there was net credit creation by the Central Bank (and Currency Board) during the year of Rs. 7 5 million, all of it in favour of Government. The total credit extended to Government, therefore, was Rs. 74 \u2022 6 million.",

Although the Bank found that no significant amount of credit was being created for non-essential purposes, it nevertheless specifically requested the commercial banks not to extend any non-essential, and particularly speculative, credit in the future. On the other hand, the Bank made it clear that it had no desire to curtail the supply of credit for the legitimate needs of the private sector of the economy. Generally speaking, the present supply is required for the satisfactory movement of Ceylon's trade. As the value of exports rises due to a rise in their prices and an increase in their volume, it must be expected that there will be an expansion of credit to finance them. This type of credit expansion is one of the least harmful to an economy, because it is short-term credit to enable the commercial movement of goods. If the value of exports contracts, credit will also contract. Thus the new money will disappear, if and when the time comes, just as naturally as it first appeared.",

    "text": "As will be seen from the table, at the time the Bank commenced business, the index had not shown an increase in any single month of as much as 10 per cent, above the preceding year. The fact that the percentage increase dropped back to 7\" 7 per cent, at the end of October, to 5' 7 per cent, at the end of November, and to 3' 4 per cent, at the end of December, was partly because the index dropped steadily as a result of increased subsidizing of the prices of flour and rationed rice as from October 1 and December 11*, and partly because there was a rise in the index from September to December of the pre\u00adceding year. Yet there is no room for complacency. The trend of the cost of living has been definitely upward since devaluation in September, 1949. The index has continued to rise in 1951, so that in February it was 4.8 per cent, above February, 1950.",
