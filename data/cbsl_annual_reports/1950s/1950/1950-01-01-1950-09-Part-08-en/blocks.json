At the end of December, 1950, there were 192 companies on the share list of the Colombo Brokers' Association of which 62 were tea, 61 rubber, 30 tea-cum-rubber, 9 coconut, and 30 commercial companies. Interest in shares has been growing steadily, and was especially keen in the latter half of 1950 following the outbreak of the Korean war and the marked rise in export prices, especially for rubber. The index for rubber shares rose from 115 in the fourth quarter of 1949 to 241 in the fourth quarter of 1950, an increase of about 110 per cent. The corresponding indexes for te-cum-rubber were 165 and 253, an increase of 63 per cent. ; and for tea 193 and 238, an increase of 23 per cent.",

Whereas in 1949 total savings had increased by only Rs. 6'4 million during the entire year, in 1950 savings increased by Rs. 33 million, an average of approximately Rs. 3 million a month. By the end of the year, in fact, the rate of. saving per month had jumped to more than Rs. 5 million per month. This rate of saving is still low, of course, but the increase of 1950 over 1949 is an encouraging indication that some members of the public at least are finding that they have a small excess of income over expenditure to put by each month for future needs.",

The sharp drop of Rs. 80 million recorded in the gross circulation at the end of August, 1950, is explained by the fact that before there was a central bank the commercial banks held their reserves in the form of currency, most of which was concentrated with the clearing bank, the Imperial Bank of India. When the Central Bank commenced business, the commercial banks deposited a good portion of this cash with the Central Bank in order to meet their reserve requirements.
