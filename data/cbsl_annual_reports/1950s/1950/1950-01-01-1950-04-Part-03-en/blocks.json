The fact that the percentage increase dropped back to 7\" 7 per cent, at the end of October, to 5' 7 per cent, at the end of November, and to 3 - 4 per cent, at the end of December, was partly because the index dropped steadily as a result of increased subsidizing of the prices of flour and rationed rice as from October 1 and December 11*, and partly because there was a rise in the index from September to December of the pre\u00adceding year. Yet there is no room for complacency. The trend of the cost of living has been definitely upward since devaluation in September, 1949. The index has continued to rise in 1951, so that in February it was 4.8 per cent, above February, 1950.",

Quite in contrast to the sharp increase in the index for the export group has been the relative stability of the indexes for the domestic and import groups. The former has only risen from 241 to 248, or about 3 per cent., while the latter has actually dropped from 251 to 247, a fall of about 1 \u2022 6 per cent., which is rather remarkable for an unusually inflationary period abroad.

The import and export groups together comprise more than half the total weights in the working class cost of living index, and imports are even more important to the middle classes than to the working classes. Over the past decade the rise in prices of imports has probably been the dominant factor in raising living costs. During 1950, however, the above figures indicate that the rise in working class living costs has been due principally to the boom in the export industries or, more specifically, to the rise in prices of domestically consumed export commodities.",

The increase in the money supply has, of course, been very serious ; there was an increase of almost 38 per cent, in 1950, and there have been further substantial increases in January and February, 1951. One of the first effects of an expanded money supply would ordinarily be upon prices of domestically produced and consumed goods. The prices of such goods have risen somewhat, but not more than was to be expected from higher prices of imports and exports being reflected in their costs. Another effect of an expanded money supply would be an increase in the demand for imports. This might result in shortages, and therefore, price rises, in particular imports in the short run. Over a longer period the flow of imports should increase, provided overseas supplies are available, the shortages should be eliminated, and prices should be restored to the level of prices abroad. There seem to have been isolated instances of such temporary shortages of imported cost of living items, but in general such items at the end of the year were selling in Ceylon markets at normal margins above their landed costs.",

The Central Bank has examined the schedule of import duties, and has satisfied itself that there are no longer any duties of any significance on working class cost of living items. As for controls, there is now no current balance of payments reason for continuing import controls on goods from either the dollar or the non-dollar area. Ceylon, as a member of the sterling area, is nevertheless continuing to control imports of dollar goods both in \u2022 order to conserve the dollar resources of the area and to enable Ceylon itself to build up a dollar reserve. The relaxation of import controls tends to reduce the cost of imported goods to the consumer, because when the commodity is quantitatively restricted there is a strong tendency for those importers who are fortunate enough to obtain licences to use the opportunity to increase prices and reap windfall gains. These importers then have a strong vested interest in the continuance of the control at the expense of the'rest of the community. In ordinary times, if it is desired to limit the quantity of imports, the necessary restriction can be achieved as effectively by the imposition of import duties, with the added advantage that the proceeds of the duties accrue to the State.",

Subsidies have an unfortunate tendency to worsen the Government's fiscal position just when it ought to improve. Subsidies tend to throw entirely upon the Government the burden of paying for the rising cost of essential commodities. This burden ought more properly to be borne by the private sector of the economy. For example, in the present situation it does not make economic sense for the Government to supply rice at less than halfprice to estate workers in order to keep living costs, and thus wages, down when the producers themselves are exceptionally prosperous. The producers do not need their profits subsidized, and since the cost of subsidies must be recovered somehow, the producers will have to pay in the end through higher taxes. Also subsidies are indiscri\u00adminate in their benefits ; the high income groups receive the same benefits as the low. Cost of living allowances, on the other hand, tend to favour the lower income groups.",

Moreover, unless an increasing number of commodities are subsidized, the burden of stabilizing the cost of living index must necessarily fall upon a very few commodities, which thus become ridiculously cheap as the others rise in price.

From the economic point of view a widespread system of subsidies has a tendency to hide real costs, to distort the country's economy, and sometimes to act as a serious barrier to efficiency. Even before the decision to increase the subsidy on rice as of December 11, the cost of subsidies was so large as to be a heavy and seemingly unending drain upon the exchequer. Government policy could now be directed toward reducing subsidies. This is not to say that some existing subsidies are not justifiable. Rice, in particular, is a relatively homogeneous commodity and is consumed in such large quantities by all income groups that its purchase and distribution by the State is feasible. More\u00adover, the subsidy applies only to imported rice, which is distributed by means of a rationing system under which the ration is usually inadequate. This has the salutary effect of tremendously stimulating the production of \" country \" rice, which is purchased and sold outside the ration in a free market at prices ordinarily somewhat higher than the c.i.f. cost of imported rice.",

As explained in Section V, there has been on the whole a gratifying increase both in production and in exports, during the past year. Monetary conditions are such at the present time as to encourage this trend.

    "text": "43. As explained earlier, the financial operations of Government have contributed to the increase in the money supply during 1950. Although the financial accounts of Government for several years have disclosed a surplus on revenue account alone, the total of all expenditures of Government, including those sums charged to loan and other funds as well as those charged to revenue, have exceeded its total cash receipts, so that the overall result has been a cash operating deficit in each of the past four years. - This cash deficit may be financed by an increase of Government indebtedness, e.g., by borrowing . or by running down of accumulated cash balances, or by both. Unless it is entirely financed by borrowing from non-bank sources, one of its effects is an increase in the money supply.
