This plan provides for a six year development programme for.

The execution of the plan is expected to involve a balance of payments deficit of Rs. 800 million out of which Rs. 250 million will be financed by drawing down sterling balances. As explained in a later section, the Sterling Assets Agreement concluded with the U.K. Government secured release of this amount from blocked balances.",

At the end of 1950 their real wages were 64 per cent, higher than at the end of 1939. In the last quarter of 1950 alone they rose.by 21\u00a3 per cent. Although no reliable data are available on wages of non-estate agricultural workers, there is reason to believe that their real wages too have moved in sympathy with those of estate workers. Urban workers, on the other hand, have fared less well. The figures for such trades as printing, motor transport, match-manufacturing, engineering and cinema reveal a fall of 3 to 5 per cent, in real wages between 1949 and 1950. The real wages of Govern\u00adment workers also suffered a decline until the increase in the cost of living allowance with retrospective effect from October, 1950, restored the real wages of those in clerical grades and below.",
