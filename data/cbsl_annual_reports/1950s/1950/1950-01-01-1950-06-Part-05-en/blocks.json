This is an extremely favourable development for an economy to which international trade is so important as it is to Ceylon, and one which most observers have been inclined to overlook.

In this respect the boom in exports has paid remarkable dividends. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the improyement recently recorded in export prices in relation to import prices does little more than restore the terms of trade to their pre-war level.",

On the other hand, population has increased steadily and the rate of increase has been particularly pronounced since 1946. There has, of course, been some expansion in food production but the available evidence does not suggest that it is adequate to meet the rising demand. Unless production outstrips the rapid increase of population, the real income per head must inevitably fall in the long run. This is a prospect less remote than it appears at first sight.",

It is most disconcerting, for example, to find that even on the crest of the present boom there is still some unemployment and a very considerable amount of underemployment. Such a situation should not be, for economic conditions could scarcely be more favourable for using labour to expand production than they are today. Purchasing power is more than adequate ; demand is brisk. Money capital, labour, and land are available. The answer lies partly at least in inadequacy of enterprise. Or, if the enterprise is present, the ways and means of linking it with money capital are absent. It is common knowledge that many of those with money are using their resources to increase their holdings of existing estates or, what is worse, to speculate, rather than to replant, to open up new land, or to start new enterprises. Such activity contributes little to the country's development.",

Although no reliable data are available on wages of non-estate agricultural workers, there is reason to believe that their real wages too have moved in sympathy with those of estate workers. Urban workers, on the other hand, have fared less well. The figures for such trades as printing, motor transport, match-manufacturing, engineering and cinema reveal a fall of 3 to 5 per cent, in real wages between 1949 and 1950. The real wages of Govern\u00adment workers also suffered a decline until the increase in the cost of living allowance with retrospective effect from October, 1950, restored the real wages of those in clerical grades and below.",
