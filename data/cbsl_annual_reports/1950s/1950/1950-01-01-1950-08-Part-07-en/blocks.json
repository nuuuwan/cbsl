As a result of negotiations conductd in London by the Honourable J. R. Jayawardene, Minister of Finance, the United Kingdom Government and the Ceylon Government reached new understandings regarding Ceylon's sterling assets and the question of an independent reserve of gold and dollars to be held by the Central Bank. These understandings were embodied in an exchange of letters dated the 2nd and the 6th of February, 1951. The United Kingdom Government agreed to transfer an additional \u00a321 million from the No. 2 to the No. 1* Account of the Central Bank of Ceylon during the seven-year period beginning 1st July, 1950, provided that such transfers would only be made as and when the total balances on No. 1 Account fell below \u00a312 million. Since Ceylon's No. 1 balances at that date were already approxi\u00admately \u00a319 million, \u00a340 million out of total external assets of \u00a366 million were unfrozen. By the end of the year, No. 1 balances, even without the additional releases, had risen to \u00a337 million, so that with the additional releases Ceylon had available \u00a358 million of No. 1 balances out of total sterling balances of \u00a381 million. Since it would be the height of financial imprudence for Ceylon to contemplate using a larger amount of its sterling assets than this over the next seven years, the new agreement means, for all practical purposes, that the problem of frozen sterling has been effectively removed as a barrier to economic policy.",

To be roughly in the same position an individual would have to have enough money in the bank to buy his usual household needs for almost an entire year. When the Ceylon figure iscompared with the corresponding figures for other small countries that are also highly dependent upon international trade, Ceylon shows up rather .well. For Belgium-the percentage is 39 per pent.,, for New Zealand 41 per cent. (1949), and for Denmark only 12-per cent. (1949). On-the other hand, for Switzerland, a country noted for its financial strength, the'figure is,145,per cent. These ratios, of course, do not tell the whole story.

In the middle of the year the Treasury found itself short of funds, especially for financing t exceptionally large food purchases, but it preferred to await the opening of the Central Bank before floating new long-term' loans. Accordingly,-the Treasury increased its offers of treasury bills, and the volume outstanding rose from Rs. 12 million in April to Rs. 100 million by November under the stimulus of a rise in the treasury bill rate from \u2022 20 per cent, to 1 per cent. Following the loan flotations in November; offerings were reduced, and the volume of treasury bills outstanding fell to Rs. 60 million by the end of the year. At the same time the rate dropped gradually to ' 52 per cent, from 1 per cent.",

Interest in shares has been growing steadily, and was especially keen in the latter half of 1950 following the outbreak of the Korean war and the marked rise in export prices, especially for rubber. The index for rubber shares rose from 115 in the fourth quarter of 1949 to 241 in the fourth quarter of 1950, an increase of about 110 per cent. The corresponding indexes for te-cum-rubber were 165 and 253, an increase of 63 per cent. ; and for tea 193 and 238, an increase of 23 per cent.",

By the end of the year, in fact, the rate of. saving per month had jumped to more than Rs. 5 million per month. This rate of saving is still low, of course, but the increase of 1950 over 1949 is an encouraging indication that some members of the public at least are finding that they have a small excess of income over expenditure to put by each month for future needs.",

The effect on the banking system of the inflationary situation which developed during the year can be traced in Statement 2.
