It was also a year in which the full effects of the devaluation of the Ceylon rupee in September, 1949, began to be felt. In addition to the measures taken by the Monetary Board in connection with the organization and commencement of business by the Bank, the major policy measures of the Board were concerned with the problems of inflation. Consequently, a considerable part of this report is devoted to an analysis of the inflationary situation in Ceylon.",
