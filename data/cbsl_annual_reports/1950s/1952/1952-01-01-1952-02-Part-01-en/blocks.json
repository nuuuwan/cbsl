The essential economic problem in 1952 was adjustment of the Ceylon economy to the new conditions prevailing after the collapse of the Korean War boom. Thus the first three Annual Reports, by a series of coincidences, cover the different problems encountered in the three phases of a boom : first, that of monetary expansion and price inflation generated by export prices rising earlier and more rapidly than import prices in the upward phase of the boom ; second, that of damping the price inflation at the peak of the boom ; and third, that of defla\u00adtionary adjustment to the squeeze on the economy when, in the collapse of the boom, export prices fell earlier and farther than import prices.",
