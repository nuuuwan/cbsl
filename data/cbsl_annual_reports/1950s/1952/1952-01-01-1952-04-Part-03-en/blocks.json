By this test the limit foi Ceylon is very nanow indeed. For the experience of 1952 suggests that, beyond a nanow limit, nearly all of any increase in the deficit is spent on imports. Certainly, in a period of adjustment to a collapsing boom the deficit cannot be greatly in excess of the external assets that the monetary and fiscal authorities are prepared to lose.

The latter went up from 0 -4 per cent per annum at the beginning of the year to 0 -92 per cent in August, 1952, at which level it stood for the rest of the year.",

With the continuing deterioration in the balance of payments, there had been a general expectation that exchange control-would be tightened. The regulations that permitted remittances below a liberal exemption limit to be made without prior approval of the Exchange Control authorities were withdrawn in September, 1952, and lower exemption limits were fixed. Subsequently the limits were progressively revised downward and by the end of the year exchange for maintenance, travel, charity and other current purposes was considerably restricted.",
