Note .- Ceylon chares of the cost of living, other than those ot the Central Bank's 1951 Report, have been plotted on an arithmetic vertical scale.'in which equal amounts of change were given equal space. This is plotted on a ratio or logarithmic, vertical scale, in which equal percentages of change are given equal space.

The ratio scale implies an assumption; that Ceylon is primarily interested in percentage changes in the cost of living, not in amounts of change. Hence it gives a truer impression of what has taken place in the movements of this index.

At every point in the chart the angles given to the right indicate the same percent per year changes.

Note : Ceylon charts of the cost of living index for estate labour, other than those of the Central Bank's 1951 Report, have been plotted on an arithmetic vertical scale, in which equal omounts of change were given equal space. This is plotted on a ratio or logarithmic, vertical scale, in which equal percentages of change are given equal space.

The new scale implies an assumption; that Ceylon is primarily interested in percentage changes in the cost of living, not in amounts of change. Hence it gives a truer impression of what has taken place in the movements of this index. At every point in the chart the angles given to the right indicate the same percent per year chances.
