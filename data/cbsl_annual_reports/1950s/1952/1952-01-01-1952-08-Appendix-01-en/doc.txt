A—Major Legal Enactments Adopted by the Government in 1952

(i) Bank of Ceylon (Amendment) Act 19 of 1952

The Bank of Ceylon (Amendment) Act 19 of 1952 is the latest amendment to the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance No. 53 of 1938.

(1) Under section 1 (e) of Part I of the first schedule to the principal enactment the granting of credit by the Bank was subject to the condition that no advances, accommodation or credit could be made or granted against the primary security of fixed or immovable property other than fixed plant or machinery. This condition has now been removed.

(2) Under the amending act, the powers conferred on the Bank under section 1 (m) of Part I of the first schedule to construct buildings, or improve, alter, develop or otherwise deal with any property or rights of the Bank were extended to apply to any land taken on lease by the Bank.

(3) Under section 3 (cc) of Part II of the first schedule the Bank was enjoined at all times to maintain in cash (either in the Bank's Treasury or at credit with the Bank's clearing agents) a total reserve of an amount not less than 10 per cent of the total credit of depositors in current, deposit or other accounts, in the Bank. The amending act deleted this provision since section 92 of the Monetary Law Act requires all commercial banks operating in Ceylon to maintain prescribed reserves with the Central Bank.

(4) The provision in section 3 (dd) of Part II of the first schedule limiting the maximum period of a loan to 24 months for seasonal loans and to six months for other loans has been repealed by the amending act.

(ii) The Exchange and Securities Control (Continuation) Act 35 of 1950

This Act, which provided for the continuance in force after December 9th, 1950 for a period of one year of the Defence (Finance) Regulations, Defence (Finance No. 2) Regulations, Defence (Finance No. 3) Regulations, and the Defence (Securities) Regulations, was further extended by resolutions passed in the Senate and House of Representatives for various periods; pending the passing into law of the Exchange Control Bill. The regulations continued to be in force through­out the year as a result of these resolutions.
