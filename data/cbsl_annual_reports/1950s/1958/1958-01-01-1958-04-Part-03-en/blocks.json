As bank liquidity was at a very low level there were \" tight money \" conditions throughout 1958. When the Govern\u00adment securities and Treasury bills held by banks matured, the banks did not reinvest the funds because of their low liquidity position. In addition, some banks redis-counted Treasury bills at the Central Bank, while some sold in the market the Govern\u00adment securities they held. Fixed and Time deposits and other liabilities of commer\u00adcial banks increased by Rs. 68 \u2022 1 million, and there was a shift of rupee cash from the public to the Government to the amount of Rs. 36 4 million. As the expansionary influence was larger than the contractive, money supply increased.",

The other years which experienced unfavourable balance of payments\u20141952, 1953 and 1957\u2014also experienced a fall in money supply. The reason why the money supply failed to decline in 1958 with the unfavourable balance of payments is the large increase of Central Bank's domestic assets, particularly its holdings of Treasury bills and advances to the Government, which more than offset the contractive influence of the balance of payments deficit. This suggests that the fluctuations in Ceylon's money supply may not necessarily be dominated by the balance of payments as in the past.",

Total deposit liabilities of the commercial banks amounted to Rs. 947 million at the end of 1958, which was Rs. 5 million higher than that at the end of 1957. But the average monthly deposits in 1958 as shown in the table on the next page, were lower than in 1957 ; they fell from Rs. 965 million in 1957 to Rs. 926 million in 19 58. This decline was due to the fall in demand deposits from a monthly average of Rs. 721 million in 1957 to Rs. 661 million in 1958. Time and Savings deposits on the other hand rose from a monthly average of Rs. 240 million in 1957 to Rs. 263 million in 1958 ; and the ratio of Time and Savings deposits to total deposits increased from a monthly average of 24-9 per cent in 1957 to 28-4 per cent in 1958. Time and Savings deposits have been increasing every year since 1950, but the large rise in 1958 was perhaps the result of the uncertainty in the business outlook and the higher rates of interest paid on Time deposits since June, 1957. An additional factor may have been the deposit of funds by those employees whose provi\u00addent funds were wound up pending the establishment of the national Employees' Provident Fund.",

    "text": "On the assets side there was a fall in liquid assets and investments while loans and overdrafts rose. It is characteristic of the commercial banking system in Ceylon that its most liquid assets\u2014cash balances and foreign currency holdings\u2014 fluctuate mainly with the balance of payments, rising with a surplus and falling with a deficit. As the year 1958 experienced an unfavourable balance of payments, a fall in cash balances and foreign currency holdings of banks was, therefore, to be expected. These balances and holdings had fallen considerably in 1957, because ofthe large deficit in the balance of payments that year. Hence their decline in 1958 brought them to a very low level\u2014from a monthly average of Rs. 211 million in 1957 to Rs. 169 million in 1958, or from 21 \u2022 9 per cent ofthe total deposits in 1957 to 18-1 per cent in 1958. Excess reserves of banks, for instance, declined from a monthly average of Rs. 25 million in 1957 to Rs. 10 million in 1958. As a result of this low level of cash reserves, some banks had to borrow frequently from the Central Bank to replenish their depleted cash balances. At the end of June, outstanding Central Bank advances to commercial banks amounted to Rs. 30- 9 million, and in August, Rs. 32-9 million.",

In view of the low level of cash balances, as mentioned earlier, banks were not in a position to subscribe to new Treasury bills on the maturity of ones they held, and some had even to discount Treasury bills at the Central Bank. The overall result was that the ratio of all bank liquid assets (cash on hand and with Central Bank, foreign currency holdings, Treasury bills and commercial bills dis\u00adcounted) to total deposits fell from a monthly average of 35-8 per cent in 1957 to 32-5 per cent in 1958.",

But banks' investments in Government securities declined from a monthly average of Rs. 308 million in 1957 to Rs. 296 million in 1958. It was pointed out earlier that as a result of the low cash balances, some banks were not only unable to reinvest the funds realised on the maturity of Government securities they held, but were also forced to sell some of their Government securities in the market. Further, they pledged some of their Government securities against advances from the Central Bank. Thus, the causes for the fall in the banks' holdings of Government securities were the same as those in the case of Treasury bills. Apparently, the banks utilised the funds realiced on maturity and sale of Government securities and Treasury bills to meet the demand for credit from the private sector.",

The minimum loan is Rs. 2,000 and the upper limit is Rs. 1 million. The State Mortgage Bank raises funds by the issue of deben\u00adtures (the principal and interest of which are guaranteed by the Government) and by overdrafts from commercial banks. The loans are granted mainly for agricultural and house building purposes.

The decline in the total amount of loans in 1957-58 s,eems to have resulted from the policy of reducing the size of loan by restricting the maximum limit of a loan to one lakh of rupees. Though there was a decline in the amount of loans granted in 1957-58, this amount was granted to meet the needs of a larger number of applicants than in 1956-57. The total amount of loans outstanding at the end of September, 1958 was Rs. 42-8 million as against Rs. 36 0 million at the end of September, 1957.

    "text": "The Ceylon Savings Bank pays 1\\ per cent interest per annum on deposits. The maximum deposit in any one year on which interest is payable is Rs. 8,000 and the maximum amount on which interest is payable that a depositor may have to his credit is Rs. 12,000. Approved societies, however, may deposit Rs. 6,000 per annum up to a maximum holding of Rs. 20,000. Public servants seem to be the largest category of depositors in the Ceylon Savings Bank. At the end of 1958, total savings deposits in the Ceylon Savings Bank amounted to Rs. 68 \u2022 4 million as compared with Rs. 68-6 million at the end of 1957. The greater part of the savings of this institu\u00adtion, as in the case of the Post Office Savings Bank, are invested in Ceylon Govern\u00adment and certain sterling securities. But unlike the Post Office Savings Bank, the Ceylon Savings Bank lends money on the security of house properties situated within Municipal limits and certain specified urban areas in Ceylon. The minimum loan granted is Rs. 2,000 and the interest charged varies from 3 per cent to 5 per cent per annum according to the size of the loan. At the end of 1957 the Ceylon Savings Bank had Rs. 63 million invested in Ceylon and British securities, and Rs. 9 million in loans on house property. Investment figures for 1958 are not yet available.",

As a result, the deficit turned out to be higher than estimated. The deficit would have been even higher but for a net receipt of Rs. 78 7 million on Government's \" advance account opera\u00adtions,\" and a substantial degree of under-expenditure.

The smaller outflow on profits and dividends was due principally to lower corporate earnings from tea and rubber exports in 1957 as compared with 1956, while the sustained withdrawals of foreign capital during recent years would have also tended to reduce income remittances. The decrease in Ceylon's earnings from its investments abroad was the result both of lower interest rates in foreign money markets as well as the decline in the magnitude of Ceylon's foreign assets in recent years.",

    "text": "Source: Central Bank of Ceylon Private Capital Movements.\u2014The net outflow on private capital account at Rs. 38-4 million in 1957 was approximately double the net overflow in 1956 of Rs. 19 \u2022 8 million. The net outflow on private capital account in 1958, however, was only Rs. 3 \u2022 7 million. This was mainly due to a decline in the repatriation of foreign capital, arising largely from the liquidation of foreign owned estates and share\u00adholdings in rupee companies from Rs. 46 6 million in 1957 to Rs. 27 2 million in 1958. In large measure the decline was consequent upon the restrictive policy towards certain types of capital transfers within the sterling area introduced in August, 1957. The low level of stock market prices in 1958 may also have reduced the liquidation of shares owned by non-residents. To a lesser extent the decrease in the net outflow on private capital account was also due to increased repatriation of Ceylonese investments abroad principally in Malayan rubber estates which increased from Rs. 1 8 million in 1957 to Rs. 8 3 million in 1958. The inflow of foreign capital for new private investment in Ceylon, which has been insignificant in recent years declining from Rs. 5 4 million in 1956 to Rs. 3 4 million in 1957, increased fractionally to Rs. 3-6 million in 1958. The low levels of fresh capital imports during recent years may be attributed in part to the prevailing uncertainties of the political and financial climate. There was an inflow of Rs. 11 6 million on short-term capital account, of which Rs. 11 5 million represented changes in the overseas balances of sterling companies and short-term liabilities of firms having traders account facilities.

The most significant developments in the regional payments pattern in 1958 were as follows : (a) the deficit with the sterling area, which had increased sharply from Rs. 124 4 million in 1956 to Rs. 336 5 million in 1957, was reduced in 1958 to Rs. 152 \u2022 3 million. The improvement was on two counts : a much smaller deficit with the U.K. (Rs. 86 \u2022 6 million as against Rs. 176 \u2022 9 million in the preceding year) and a much larger surplus with the rest of the sterling area, other than India and Pakistan (Rs. 166 4 million as against Rs. 83 2 million in the preceding year). The large traditional deficit with India and Pakistan was somewhat larger in 1958 than in 1957 ; (6) the tradi\u00adtional surplus with the non-dollar non-sterling area, which had turned into a deficit of Rs. 43 \u2022 6 million in 1957, deteriorated much further to a deficit of Rs. 172 8 million in 1958. This was due to a marked worsening in the payments position with non-O.E.E.C. countries, mainly China, the Middle East and Japan, from a surplus of Rs. 3 6 3 million in 1957 to a deficit of Rs. 149 6 million in 1958. The deficit with Continental O.E.E.C. countries actually improved from Rs. 79 \"6 million in 1957 to Rs. 23 2 million in 1958.",

The sharp worsening of the payments position in the 2nd quarter was due to the emergence of an abnormally large deficit of Rs. 110-3 million on merchandise account con\u00adsequent upon substantial payments for Government imports of rice, flour and sugar in April, and a considerable decline in export earnings in May and June as a result",

In the 3rd quarter, with the marked improvement in the payments position to a surplus of Rs. 26-5 million, external assets rose by Rs. 56-4 million, while over the last quarter as a whole, external assets fell by Rs. 8-9 million. Over the year as a whole, therefore, external assets declined by a net amount of Rs. 59-8 million to a level of Rs. 883-3 million at the end of December, 1958.",

    "text": "If the gross assets at the end of 1958 of Rs. 883 \u2022 3 million, amounting to over 54 per cent of the country's annual imports, are adjusted to exclude the sterling loans sinking funds and net liabilities on payments agreements, the figure would be in the region of Rs. 780 million. This would form about 48 per cent of the country's import bill, a ratio which does not compare unfavourably with some other countries which are also highly dependent on international trade. Ceylon's international financial position is likely to be further strengthened by the proposed increase in Ceylon's quota in the I.M.F. The existing level of reserves can thus be said to be an adequate one in the generally accepted definition of that term. However, in view of the contemplated development programme, it must be expected to be subject to additional strain in the future.",
