Such an increase of quota will mean that Ceylon's ability to purchase foreign currencies from the Fund in case of balance of payments difficulties would be correspondingly expanded. In view of the wide swings to which our balance of payments is subjected—the more so as the develop­ment programme gathers momentum—providing for an added line of reserve against possible payments difficulties is both prudent and timely.
