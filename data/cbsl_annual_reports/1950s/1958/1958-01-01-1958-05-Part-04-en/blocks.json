However, in examining the policies and measures adopted by the Monetary Board, there must always be borne in mind the inherent limits imposed upon central banking by the specific conditions of an under-developed economy such as that of Ceylon. The Central Bank has to operate in an economy where the domestic money market is rudimentary and where important factors determining the fluctuations in levels of economic activity are outside its control. In this context, nevertheless, it has to pursue its objective of regulating the flow of money so as to favour the best possible results in the prevailing economic circumstances.",

It was the duty of the Central Bank as banker to the Government to keep the Govern\u00adment supplied with sufficient funds to carry out its operations, having due regard to the objectives laid down in the Monetary Law Act. The Bank performed this function by extending short-term credit to the Government by means of both direct advances and the purchase of Treasury bills.

Excess reserves of commercial banks in 1958 were at their lowest levels since the Central Bank commenced operations. Balances of commercial banks held abroad remained sizeable and fairly stable during the year as a whole, though there was some fluctuation from month to month towards the middle of the year. If the tight cash position of the commercial banks had been allowed to continue, the latter would have been forced to curtail their credit to, amongst others, the import and export trade which forms the predominant business of commercial banks in Ceylon. Such a curtailment of credit, if allowed, would have tended to have an adverse effect on the export and import trade and, consequently on national income and the domestic level of prices. It was the duty of the Central Bank, in the circumstances, to ensure that the free flow of essential foreign trade was not hampered by the restriction of credit.",

These credit instruments are promissory notes drawn by commercial banks in favour of the Central Bank secured by the pledge with the Central Bank of usance notes of their customers resulting from transactions relating to domestic production, exports, the purchase, sale or trans\u00adportation within Ceylon of readily saleable goods and products (excluding imports): and the storage of non-perishable goods and products (excluding imports).
