On the whole, the downward trend which began with the break of the 1955 boom and continued through 1956 and 1957 was arrested in 1958. Although 1958 itself was not as good a year as 1955, there appeared during the year several indicators which were favourable. The terms of trade moved in Ceylon's favour, reversing the adverse trend which had begun after 1955. The value of exports increased and the value of imports fell. The decline in external assets was substantially lower than in 1957 and physical production was higher in most spheres.",

The year began in the gloomy aftermath of one of the worst floods in recent history. No sooner had the flood rehabilitation schemes got under way than strikes broke out both in the public and private sectors. Hard on the heels of these indus\u00adtrial disputes came the communal disturbances of May-June and the declaration of a State of Emergency. All this and the unsatisfactory conditions of cargo handling in the Port of Colombo led to serious dislocation in the economy. However, as a result of both the increase in physical production and the favourable movement of the terms of trade the overall economic situation was better than in the previous year.",

However, per capita personal consumption declined slightly by 0 \u2022 3 per cent in real terms.

Government capital formation is equated to what may be termed Government expenditure on the acquisition, construction and maintenance of real assets. Even here, since the Government's operations and methods of accounting are not designed with clear distinction between current and capital expenditure, the estimates are at best approximate. The difficulty regarding inadequacy of data is more acute in the measurement of capital formation in the private sector. The present estimates, based largely on data on imports of capital goods, involve rather arbitrary assumptions regarding the value added in the construction of buildings and erection of machinery. Since there is hardly any reliable information on depreciation in the unorganised private sector and the Government, the computa\u00adtion of net capital formation is rendered almost impracticable.",

This fall in the value of imports was due to lower prices. The overall result was that the country's adverse balance of trade was reduced from Rs. 123 million in 1957 to only Rs. 6 million in 1958.",

As a consequence, the terms of trade moved in Ceylon's favour by 6 3 per cent, thus reversing a declining trend which began after 1955. One of the fundamental factors contributing to the favourable trend in import prices has been the cheapening in the world prices of food, particularly rice and flour, combined with the depressed state of freight rates for shipping. Imports of essential consumer goods like food, drink and textiles constitute over 50 per cent of the value of Ceylon's imports and, therefore, any change in the prices paid for goods in this sector is reflected quickly in the aggregate index of import prices. Moreover, in 1958, Ceylon was further assisted by a decline of 7 \u2022 9 per cent in the prices paid for capital goods. The biggest fall (8 3 per cent) was in the category of \" wholly or mainly manufactured capital goods\". The price index of relatively unmanufactured capital goods, too, fell by 7*2 per cent.",

Low grown 'teas suffered most in the decline (40 cents per pound); the fall in respect of medium grown teas was much smaller (10 cents per pound). The prices of high grown teas displayed a degree of Resilience as compared with the other grades, but even though they showed an improvement of 6 cents per pound as compared with 1957, they too have suffered in the general decline in tea prices ; in fact the real burden may have been slightly higher in this group because the costs of maintenance are generally high in the case of estates producing this type of tea.",

The biggest improve\u00adment in shipments has been in respect of the United Kingdom ; exports rose by 31 \u2022 9 million pounds (24' 1 per cent) to 164 6 million pounds (the highest so far recorded) and by Rs. 99 9 million (27 \u2022 0 per cent) to Rs. 470 \u2022 1 million. Exports to Australia recorded the second biggest increase, improving by 6 \u2022 8 million pounds and Rs. 16 \u2022 3 million respectively, the quantum of exports accelerating slightly in the latter part of the year. Purchases by the Union of South Africa declined fractionally but a slight improvement in the f.o.b. price of teas shipped to that country proved to be a compensatory factor; the value of shipments consequently rose by Rs. 3 \u2022 7 million.

    "text": "Coconuts.\u2014In the Annual Report for 1957, it was observed that the volume of exports of the three major coconut products (as measured by the Central Bank trade indices) fell to their lowest level since 1949. The position deteriorated further in 1958. The index number of 101 for 1958 was the lowest since 1949, and also represented a fall of 3 \u2022 8 per cent as compared with the previous year. Notwithstand\u00ading this decline in volume, the combined value of these three products showed an improvement of Rs. 8 million over the previous year as a consequence of an all-round improvement in f.o.b. prices. The f.o.b. price of desiccated coconut increased most, by 13 6 per cent (or Rs. 153 00 per ton), coconut oil prices improved by 11 1 per cent (or Rs. 140 00 per ton) while copra prices were higher by 10 5 per cent (or Rs. 100 00 per ton). The volume of desiccated coconut shipments rose by 157 thousand cwts. (16 1 per cent), but was insufficient to offset declines of 141 thousand cwts. (20 3 per cent) and 194 thousand cwts. (17 9 per cent) in the quantum of copra and coconut oil exports respectively.",

    "text": "The buoyancy in coconut export prices is mainly the result of bad crops elsewhere, in particular the Philippines. The contribution of Ceylon's exports of coconut products to the world supply is small and the chief aim of policy should be to increase the acreage under cultivation (which has been stagnant for a number of decades) and the yield of maturing plants. In 1956 the share of coconuts in the total value of exports amounted to 12 3 per cent. Since then its share has declined gradually till it constituted only 9 \u2022 6 per cent in 1958. A feature of the pattern of coconut oil exports in 1958 has been the decline of the United Kingdom from the position of the second largest buyer in 1957, to that of the smallest. Exports to that country fell by 76' 9 per cent. Other significant contractions were those in respect of Canada (51 '5 per cent) and India (58 5 per cent). The improvement in desiccated coconut exports has been due in large measure to the expansion of purchases on the part of almost all major buying countries. India, which has been almost the sole buyer of Ceylon's copra, adopted a more rigorous policy in the licensing of imports in 1957. The reduction of 21 3 per cent in the volume of copra exports to India in 1958 is a further reflection of a trend that commenced in 1956.",

In the export sector the proportion of Chinese trade in total exports from Ceylon fell from 10 5 per cent in 1957 to 4 7 per cent in 1958. While the increase in imports from China are due largely to the increase in the value of rice imported (from Rs. 76 million in 1957 to Rs. 121 million in 1958), a much greater proportionate change has taken place in the increase of imports other than rice. These increased from Rs. 8 million in 1957 to Rs. 31 million in 1958. During the year 1958, the value of such imports increased from Rs. 6 million in the first half year to Rs. 25 million in the second half. Imports of food other than rice increased from Rs. 7 million in 1957 to Rs. 17 million. Increases were recorded over a wide range of other imports including textiles, cement, electrical goods, iron and steel and machinery.",
