    "text": "4. In the year, 1954, Ceylon made a remarkable economic and financial recovery. The preceding year had ended with Ceylon's economy in an adverse disequilibrium with the outside world. External assets had been lost in that year to the amount of Rs. 230 million, and although an improvement in the terms of trade had occurred, the year had closed with a trade deficit of Rs. 40 million. But in 1954, the record was different. The terms of trade, which in a large measure determine the level of real income in Ceylon, were on the average 22 per cent higher than in 1953 ; also, for the first time in many years, the Government had an overall budget surplus in the financial year, 1953-54. These factors accounted in the main for a record trade surplus in 1954 of Rs. 412 million and a rise in external assets of Rs. 288 million.",

The increase in export value was fortuitous, due mainly to a rise in tea prices, It may ordinarily have been expected that a rise in export values resulting in an.increase in income may have led to an increase in expenditure, including expenditure in imports. But the circumstance that in the year under review Ceylon spent less on imports would appear to need some explanation. There is no doubt that in part at least the decline in expenditure on imports was occasioned by a general fall in the prices of imports, but there was also a decrease in the volume of imports below that in the previous year.",
