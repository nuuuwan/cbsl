48. The purpose of the Corporation will be primarily to promote and assist new enterprises in industry, and the expansion and modernisation of existing agri­cultural concerns. Such an institution should provide a useful channel for funds now available with commercial banks to be invested in productive development. Other private capital available could also be invested not only in the shares of the Corporation itself,. but also in the new enterprises which will be stimulated by its assistance.

49. Exchange Control.—With the improvement in the balance of payments, no additional restrictions were found to be necessary in 1954, over and above the degree of intensification reached in 1953, when control of personal outward remit­tances was further tightened.

50. The continuance of restrictions as in 1953 was mainly influenced by the special need for strengthening the country's external reserves, for the additional purpose of financing foreign expenditures on economic development and on transfers of assets of Indian repatriates.

51. In the administration of exchange control in 1954, the Central Bank continued to receive the ready support and co-operation of the commercial banks.

The prices paid for shipments to China dropped by 11 per cent in 1954 as com­pared with the previous year. Yet they were at a level well above world prices until the end of the year, when the rise in world prices reduced appreciably the pre­mium on prices paid by China.

57. In 1954, as in other recent years, food imports accounted for nearly half of the total value of all imports. And while the aggregate value of all imports fell by Rs. 211 million or 14 per cent, the value of food imports alone fell by as much as Rs. 129 million or 17 per'cent. The lower import value of food in 1954 was due to a decline of 9 per cent in the quantity of imports and of 11 per cent in the average price. Between 1953 and 1954 average c.i.f. prices per ton of rice fell from Rs. 801 to Rs. 690, of flour from Rs. 570 to Rs. 458 and of sugar from Rs. 495 to Rs. 456. The total value of raw materials imported fell by Rs. 25 million or 15 per cent. The value of manufactured goods as a group fell by Rs. 53 million or 8 per cent. Both the volume and the average price of textiles declined, by 3 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.

58. Pattern of Trade.—Table 29-shows the distribution of foreign trade by important regions and monetary areas. In contrast with the usual pattern of a deficit with the sterling area, offset partly or wholly by a surplus with the non-sterling area, there was in 1954 a surplus of Rs. 196 -6 million with the former far exceeding the surplus of Rs. 139 -4 million with the latter.

59. The percentage distribution of Ceylon's exports and imports by monetary areas is given in the table below :—

The sterling area group of countries continued to provide the largest market for Ceylon's exports and the most important source of supply of its imports. Exports in 1954 to this area expanded by Rs. 262 million, mainly as a result of an increase, of Rs. 223 million, in the value of tea exports. Imports, however, declined by Rs. 204 million. The chief reason for this decline was a fall in the price and the quantity of flour imports, the value of which was Rs. 73 million lower than in 1953. There were also substantial decreases in the value of imports of sugar, textiles, machinery and motor vehicles.

60. Ceylon's trade surplus with the dollar area decreased from Rs. 140 million in 1953 to Rs. 132 million in 1954. This small decline was due almost entirely to a fall .in the value of exports ; the value of imports remained very nearly unchanged.

Ceylon's trade with China, from 1953 onwards, is essentially an outcome of the five-year rice-rubber agreement concluded with that country in December, 1952. Exports in 1954 comprised rubber predominantly, and coconut oil to a small extent, and imports consisted of rice almost exclusively. Under the 1954 contract, Ceylon was to supply 50,000 metric tons of rubber, at 28 pence (Rs. 1/55) per pound f.o.b. Colombo for the top grades of sheet rubber, and China was to supply 270,000 metric

( l e )

tons of rice at £47 (Rs. 627/-) per metric ton f.o.b. China ports. With the decline of 11 per cent in the average price, and of 18 per cent in the quantity, of rice im­ported from China at 1954, its import value, at Rs. 148 million, was Rs. 55 million less than in 1953. As the average price of rubber to China in 1954 was 11 per cent lower than in 1953,,while the quantity actually exported to China (60,000 metric tons) was nearly constant, its export value fell by Rs. 24 -4 million to Rs. 206 million.

62. Under the agreement with Burma for annual purchases of 200,000 long tons of rice over the period 1953 to 1957, the contract price for 1954 was £50 per ton (£2 less than for 1953). The quantity of rice imported from this source in 1954 was 166,881 long tons (Rs. 115 million) compared with 140,615 long tons (Rs. 118 million) in 1953.

63. In 1954, payments problems arising in Egypt tended ,to impede exports of Ceylon tea to that country. With a view to overcoming these difficulties and at the same time encouraging a greater flow of trade between the two countries, a bilateral trade and payments agreement with Egypt was concluded in November, 1954. This agreement underlines the importance of the Egyptian market for Ceylon tea ; for Egypt is not only the fourth largest buyer, but also provides a special market for tea of a particular quality.

Money and Banking

64. Money Supply.—The falling trend of the money supply which persisted through 1953 continued into the first four nionths of 1954. From May onwards the money supply rose fairly steadily ; at the end of the year it was Rs. 957 -1 million, or 15 -7 per cent higher than a year previous.

66. Commercial Banks.—The main changes in the commercial banking situa­tion in 1954 are summarised below :—

(a) Total deposit liabilities rose by Rs. 145 -9 million (22 per cent) to Rs. 795 -6

million, Government deposits from Rs. 45 -9 million to Rs. 53 -0 million and private deposits from Rs. 590 -8 million to Rs. 737 -0 million. Though total demand deposits increased absolutely by Rs. 101 -5 million to Rs. 649 -0 million, and time and savings deposits by Rs. 44 -3 million to Rs. 146 -6 million, proportionately the former rose much less (18 per cent) than the latter (43 per cent).

(b) Bank cash, comprising till money and balances with the Central Bank,

rose by Rs. 40 -6 million or 44 -6 per cent. The ratio of cash to total deposits thus increased from 14 -1 per cent to 16 -6 per cent.'

(c) Foreign balances, including unmatured export bills, rose by Rs. 35 -8 million.

(d) Credit to the private sector, that is, the sum of loans, overdrafts, import

and export bills, increased by Rs. 53 -7 million (21 -2 per cent), overdrafts alone being Rs. 29 -9 million higher.

(' 18 )

(e) Credit to Government increased by Rs. 26 -2 million, commercial bank hold­ings of long dated securities having fallen by Rs. 8 -4 million, and hold­ings of treasury bills having increased by Rs. 34 -7 million.

(/) Total liquid assets rose by Rs. 120-0 million (47 per cent) to Rs. 375-5 million.

(g) Excess reserves, which were at a very low level in the last quarter of 1953, rose by Rs. 27 -3 million over the year. The highest level was reached in September, when they stood at Rs. 49 -2 million.

This situation developed at a time when there was a substantial rise in banks' costs due to the large increase in time-and savings deposits.

Public Finance

68. Government Accounts, 1953-54.—The analysis of Government accounts

in the table on page 20, shows that in 1953-54 there were many striking changes as

compared with previous years.

(a) Government had a net cash operating surplus of Rs. 33 -7 million after a

continuous series of deficits from 1946-47.

(b) Revenue exceeded current expenditure by a record figure of Rs. 254 -2

t million ; even in the boom year 1950-51, the revenue surplus was

only Rs. 122 -7 million.

(c) Total revenue at Rs. 1,026-2 million reached its highest level for any

financial year, largely as a result of the high export duty collections

on tea. Revenue from import duties and income tax, estate duty

and stamps, was, however, slightly lower than in the previous financial

year.

(d) The main reason for the record revenue surplus was the sharp reduction

in current expenditure, which at Rs. 772 ;0 million was at its lowest

level since 1949-50. This decrease was very largely due to the virtual

elimination of the food subsidy.

(e) Loan and loan fund expenditure at Rs. 162 -3 million was considerably

lower than in 1951-52 and 1952 53.

(/) Government's borrowing and lending operations resulted in a net payment

of Rs. 35 -3 million, financed by the budget surplus of Rs. 33 -7 million

and a withdrawal of Rs. 1 -6 million from cash balances. This net

payment stands out in sharp contrast with a series of net receipts

from 1947-48.

The total net debt fell by Rs. 108 -3 million in 1954 as compared with increases of Rs. 283 -6 million and Rs. 150 -9 million in 1952 and 1953 respectively. There was a large decrease in the floating debt which was offset to some extent by the increase in the funded debt, both domestic and foreign.

71. Funded Debt.—In the calendar year total gross funded debt increased by Rs. 123 -1 million, rupee funded debt by Rs. 51 -6 million, and foreign debt (which is entirely funded debt) by Rs. 71 -5 million.

69. The table below shows how capital expenditures were financed. In 1953-54, the current account surplus (that is, the excess of Government revenue over non­capital outlays) exceeded total capital expenditure. The balance of the surplus was utilised to redeem domestic debt.

543-8 626 -3 674 -2 0-780

The increase in the rupee debt was the combined result of (a) the issue in June of the 3 | per cent Loan 1964 for Rs. 70 million, and (6) the repayment in August of the maturing 3 per cent National Loan 1954 for Rs. 18 -4 million. The Joan for Rs. 70 million was issued mainly to convert a substantial part of the outstanding temporary borrowing from a savings bank and from other sources. New money obtained from this Loan amounted to only Rs. 9 -95 million.

72. The Loan was offered at par and was over-subscribed by Rs. 5 -5 million. The allotments of the loan were as follows :—

73. The increase of Rs. 71 -5 million in the gross foreign debt was made up of Rs. 66-7 million, representing the nominal value of the 1973-75 Loan at 4 per cent issued in London in March, and of Rs. 4 -8 million withdrawn from the I.B.R.D. under the Loan Agreement signed in June.

74. The London Loan was issued at 97 giving a yield of 4 -22 per cent to the final redemption date and was fully subscribed. The net proceeds of the Loan were Rs. 63 -3 million.

Funded Debt

[In millions of rupees)

( 24 )

75. The I.B.R.D. Loan was for a sum of Rs. 91 million ($19-11 million). This amount includes $1 -68 million t of capitalised charges (interest, commission and commitment fees) due up to July 15th, 1958. The money is being made available in various foreign currencies to meet the costs in those currencies of Stage IIA of the Laxapana Hydro-Electric Scheme. The Loan bears interest at 4 | per cent, which includes a commission of 1 per cent chargeable under Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the I.B.R.D. The rate of 4 | per cent applies only to amounts withdrawn from time to time and outstanding in the books of the I.B.R.D., amounts not withdrawn bearing a commitment charge of f per cent. The Loan is for a term of 25 years. Regular amortisation (together with interest) will commence 4 | years after the signing of the Loan Agreement, the first payment being due on January 15th, 1959.

76. Sinking Funds.—The value of sinking funds established for the redemption of public debt was Rs. 199-0 million at the end of December, 1954, as compared ,, with Rs. 181 -6 million at the end of December, 1953. In the course of the year, a sum of Rs. 12 -0 million was appropriated out of the sinking funds, to meet part of the repayment of the 3 per cent National Loan, 1954. The increase in the sinking Funds > despite this withdrawal was due to contributions from revenue, the appreciation in the value of and the accrual of interest on their investments.

77. Floating Debt.—There was a sharp decrease of Rs-. 214-1 million in the floating debt in contrast with increases of Rs. 201 -1 million and Rs. 103 -0 million . in 1952 and 1953 respectively. The proportion of floating to total debt decreased from 27 -2 per cent at the end of 1953 to 9 -7 per cent at the end of 1954.

78. Prices and Yields of Government Securities.—As in 1953, the treasury bill rate setthepace for the general movement in interest rates in 1954. The treasury bill rate started going down in March. This decline was followed within the next two months by a fall in the yields of medium and long-term securities. The bill rate continued to decline till September, when having reached 0 -70 per cent it recovered slightly and remained around 0 -86 per cent for the rest of the year. In the last quarter of the year, the yields on medium and long-term securities too were fairly stable.

80. Borrowing as Agent for Other Institutions.—This was confined in 1954 to

the issue in December of debentures for Rs. 5 million under the authority of the

National Housing Act, No. 37 of 1954. The issue was at par, with a maturity of

15 to 17 years and carried interest at 3 | per cent. Total applications for stock .

amounted to Rs. 13 -93 million. In order to permit subscriptions to be as broad-

based as possible, applicants for Rs. 250,000 and under were allotted the full

amount applied for, while applicants for larger amounts were allotted Rs. 250,000

each.

82. Wages.—Tea and rubber estate workers, who constitute the largest single group of employed persons, were on the average better off in 1954 than in the previous, year. Their money wages were 2 -1 per cent higher, chiefly because of increased basic wages for tea estate workers from August onwards. The rise in money wages coupled with the lower cost of living resulted in a rise of 2 -6 per cent in the real wages of tea and rubber estate workers.

83. Employment.—Data on the number of registrants at the employment exchanges are given below :—

Period Number Index

1938 16,480 100 1950 65,122 395 1951 52,707 320 1952 53,023 322 1953 51,546 313 1954 1st Quarter 53,052 322 2nd Quarter 54,259 329 3rd Quarter 60,094 365 4th Quarter 63,304 384

The survey of Ceylon's Consumer Finances, undertaken by the Central Bank in 1953, revealed that, in the 12-month period ending in May, 16-6 per cent of the work force, as defined for the purposes of this survey, and 6 -6 per cent of the total

( 27 )

population were unemployed. The figures of registrations at the exchanges, however,

include both unemployed and those seeking better employment and probably exclude

workers in the estate and rural sectors who in general make little use of the exchanges.

National Income

84. The national income in 1953, as computed by the Department of Census

and Statistics, was Rs. 4,479 million; On a rough calculation made by the Central

Bank, the figure for 1954 can be provisionally estimated to be in the region of

Rs. 4,700 million. On this estimate the national income in 1954 rose by 5 per

cent over 1953.

85. This rise was mainly due to the large increase (36 per cent) in the value

of tea output, resulting from an increase of 26 per cent in price and nearly 8 per cent

in physical output. There was also a substantial increase in paddy production.

Physical output increased by an estimated 30 per cent. Rubber and coconut how­

ever declined, both prices and output being lower than in 1953.

Balance of Payments and External Assets

86. In contrast with a deficit of Rs. 158 -3 million (as revised) for 1953, the

balance of payments surplus for 1954, as provisionally estimated, was Rs. 303 -0

million. The major factors responsible for the substantial improvement have

already been mentioned.

87. The net outflow through private remittances and migrants' transfers

was Rs. 66 -7 million, an increase of Rs. 8 million over 1953, due mainly to transfers

of migrants' assets to India. The figures relating to transfers as the result of volun­

tary and compulsory repatriation of Indian nationals, show a steady increase with

a very sharp rise during the last quarter of the year. Expenditure on foreign travel

showed a decline in 1954. Under the exchange restrictions intensified in 1953 and

maintained in 1954, net expenditure on foreign travel amounted to Rs. 26 -3 million,

being Rs. 11-8 million lower than in 1953.

'88. Repatriation of foreign-owned capital amounted to Rs. 27 -4 million,

while increased export earnings enabled the sterling companies operating in Ceylon

to maintain larger balances abroad. There was a net outflow of Rs. 50 -3 million

on the private capital account in 1954, as compared with Rs. 37 -6 million in 1953.

89. Of the increase of Rs. 288 million in external assets, Rs. 224 -7 million reflected the improvement in the balance of payments and Rs. 63 -3 million the proceeds of the London Loan raised in March, 1954.
