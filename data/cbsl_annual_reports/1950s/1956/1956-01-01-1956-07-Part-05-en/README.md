110. Total foreign exchange transactions of the Central Bank are shown in table 10. Spot purchases were Rs. 151 -2 million and spot sales Rs. 535-3 million as compared with Rs. 211-2 million and Rs. 456-6 million respectively in 1955.

Total purchases (spot and deliveries under forward contracts) amounted therefore to Rs. 596-7 million; and total sales to Rs. 535-3 million.

111. Circulation of 2-cent Coins.—Reference was made in para 116 of last year's Report to the issue of a 2-cent coin bearing the effigy of Her Majesty Queen Eliza­beth II. The demand for 2-cent coins increased very greatly in 1956. In addition to the 5 million 2-cent coins delivered in 1955, a further 10-6 million coins of the same denomination had to be obtained in 1956. The per capita circulation of all coins stands at approximately Rs. 2-8 at 31st December, 1956, as compared with Rs. 2-5 at 31st December, 1951, when subsidiary notes had almost entirely been replaced by coins.

112. Demonetization of Old Pattern Currency Notes.—Reference was made in para 117 of last year's Report to the " calling in " of old pattern currency notes of the denomination of Rs. 10 and below, including subsidiary notes of the denomina­tions of 50 cents, 25 cents and 10 cents. The following currency notes ceased to be legal tender after 31st August, 1956—all currency notes of the denominations of Rs. 10, Rs. 5, Rs. 2, and Re. 1, and subsidiary notes of the denominations 50 cents, 25 cents and 10 cents, bearing a date prior to December 31, 1950, and the facsimiles of the signatures of the Commissioners of Currency.

113. These notes can now be exchanged only at Government Kachcheries up to 31st August, 1957, and at the Central Bank for some years to come.

115. During the year there were four prosecutions for possession of counterfeit notes, one for possession of blocks for counterfeiting Re. 1 currency notes and one for conspiracy to counterfeit Re. 1 notes and possession of instruments and materials therefor. These counterfeits were not such close reproductions of the genuine notes as to constitute a real danger to the security of the currency note issue. The Ceylon Police deserve to be commended for their vigilance in bringing these cases to light.
