Since demand deposits account for nearly two-thirds of the money supply, their less frequent use in 1956 is therefore a significant factor offsetting to some extent the effect of a rise in the money-supply.",

The import group of the index was on the average 3 -9 per cent lower in 1956, although there was an increase in the average import price ; this was due, partly, to the fact that the rise in the average import price was only to a small extent in consumer goods, and, partly, to the fact that Government reduced the price of subsidised rice and of sugar, with effect from May, 1956. There was a rise of nearly 13 per cent in the export group of the index, reflecting mainly an increase in the domestic retail price of fresh coconuts due largely to a rise in the export price.

The reduction, in May, 1956, in the sale price of rationed rice from 50 cents to 40 cents per measure, and of sugar from 60 cents to 55 cents per pound, was expected to increase the loss in the financial year 1955-56 to Rs. 76 million.

The budget was framed with due regard to the need for maintaining the disposable income of the private sector and the developmental expenditure of the Government at a relatively stable and high level. The main criteria for determining the nature and scope of the budget were the prospects for export commodities in the year, and the amount of external assets available for use in that and the following years. The export prospects for 1956-57 were considered to be less favourable than in the previous years. However, in view of the high level of external assets, and of the general stability of internal costs and prices in the economy, a budget deficit of the order of Rs. 150 million was deemed to be not unreasonable for the year 1956-57.",
