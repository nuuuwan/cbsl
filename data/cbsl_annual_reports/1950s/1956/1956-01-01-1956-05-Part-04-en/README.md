million. Savings certificates outstanding increased by Rs. 1 -8 million to Rs. 26-6 million. Tho incrcaso in savings certificates occurred during the last four months of the year, following the issue, from August, 1956, of a new series of 10-year certi­ficates carrying an increased return of 5 per cont if held to maturity.

51. Bank Credit to the Private Sector.—Total loans and advances of the commercial banks increased from Rs. 324 • 1 million at the end of 1955 to Rs. 407 • 2 million at the end of 1956. This increase of credit, by Rs. 83 • 1 million, went into the financing mainly of export stocks and to some extent of import stocks. That the amount of finance required by the import trade should be greater in 1956 is obvious enough, since the value of imports increased in that year. But the fact that the export trado also required more finance, even though the value of exports was less in 1956, would seem to require further comment.

52. Export values were very high in 1955 mainly because the f.o.b. price of tea was very high in the first quarter of the year. The average Colombo market price of oxport commodities during the period April to December, 1955, was lower than the average market price during the corresponding period of 1956. In particular, during the latter part of 1956 the trend in tea prices was upward. It should further be mentioned that the shipping difficulties associated with the Suez crisis and labour unrest in the Port also probably had the effect of increasing the financial require­ments of the export trade to above normal levels.

53. Thus, although the loans and advances of the commercial banks increased fairly substantially in 1956, the credit expansion was necessary. Also, the credit expansion was expected to be temporary. Consequently the Central Bank did not consider the adoption of any restrictive policies as regards bank credit.

54. A general survey of the range and distribution of bank credit was instituted by the Central Bank towards the end of the year and its results should be available in 1957.

55. Price Control.—In November, price control of currystuffs, milk food?, drugs and cement was introduced, largely as a precautionary measure in view of the condi­tions created by the Suez crisis. Also, a scheme was formulated in November for petrol rationing which, however, was not put into effect.

56. Exchange Control.—There was no change in policy in 1956.

57. Exports.—Statistics of value, volume and price of exports from 1938 onwards arc given in tables 26 and 28.( 1 ) The total value of exports in 1956, at nearly Rs. 1,735 million, was 10-6 per cent lower than the record of Rs. 1,940 million in 1955. The average price and the physical volume of exports decreased by 6-3 per cent and 6-4 per cent respectively.

58. With the decrease of 9 • 1 per cont in the average price, and of 3 • 9 per cont in the quantity, of tea exports in 1956 compared With 1955, the contribution of tea to the aggregate value of all exports fell from nearly 62 per cent in 1955 to a little over 60 per cent in 1956. The share of rubber in total oxports decreased from

18 per cent in !955to about 17 per cent in 1956, while that of tho three major coco­nut products taken together rose from 11-6 per cent to 12-3 per cent. The decline in the aggregate value of exports of copra, coconut oil and desiccated coconut— the three major coconut products—was much less than the decline in the value of exports of tea and rubber.

59. The average f.o.b. price of tea fell from Rs. 3-30 per pound in 1955 to Rs. 3-00 per pound in 1956. The annual averages, however, concealed significant changes in the trend of prices within this two-year period. Prices were at their highest in the first quarter of 1955 averaging Rs. 4-27 per pound but they declined to Rs. 3 08 per pound in December, 1955. In 1956, prices remained generally lower than Rs. 3-08 per pound until the fourth quarter when it averaged Rs. 3-18 per pound. Although the quantity of tea exported in 1956 was 3-9 per cent lower than that in 1955, tea exports in the first half of 1956 were 6 million pounds higher than in the same period of 1955. Exports in the second half of 1956, however, were 20 million pounds lower than in the corresponding period of 1955.

60. The quantity of rubber exported declined 13 per cent from 216 million lbs. in 1955 to 188 million lbs. in 1956. The average price received for sheet rubber under the Five-Year Rice-Rubber Agreement with China was 34-65 pence (Rs. 1 -92) per lb. in 1955 and 31 -55 penco (Rs. 1 -75) per lb. in 1956. The average f.o.b. price per lb. for all other grades of rubber declined from Rs. 1 • 65 per lb. in 1955 to Rs. 1 • 53 per lb. in 1956. The marked changes in the world price of rubber (Singapore f.o.b. for R.S.S. No. 1—highest Rs. 1 -96, lowest Rs. 1-12 per lb.) were not communicated to the local market in 1956, where purchases for delivery to China were made at a fixed price of Rs. 1 -51 per lb. till 17th May and thereafter at Rs. 1 -41 per lb. up to the end of the year.

61. The volume of exports of the three major coconut products (coconut oil, desic­cated coconut and copra) as measured by a combined index, declined by 6 1 per cent as compared with 1955 ; prices improved somewhat. The prices of copra and coconut oil rose during the second and last quarters of the year but the price of desiccated coconut rose almost uninterruptedly throughout the year. The increase in the price of desiccated coconut was associated with a larger share in the total volume of the three major coconut products exported.

63. The volume of food imported as measured by the Central Bank of Ceylon Trade Index increased by 11 -6 per cent and rice alone 27 -6 per cent as compared with the previous year. The average c.i.f. price of rice fell further to Rs. 545 per ton, continuing the downward trend from 1953 when the price was Rs. 801 per ton. The price of several other items in the food group rose offsetting the decline in the price of rice, so that the index remained unchanged. In the non-food groups of imports the volume of textiles rose sharply by 16 -2 per cent. The volume of capital goods declined by 2 - 7 per cent.

64. Pattern of Trade.—Table 30 shows the distribution of foreign trade by signi­ficant regions and monetary areas. The surplus with the Sterling Area and with the non-Sterling Area contracted very sharply from Rs. 188 0 million and Rs. 292 -4 million in 1955 to Rs. 29-5 million and Rs. 75-8 million, respectively.

66. The turnover of trade with China improved somewhat in 1956. The volume of rubber exported was greater by 54-9 per cent, and of rice imported by 101 -4 per cent. In addition, a further 78,600 tons of rice were shipped from Burma on account

of China. In October, 1955, the price payable by China for top grades of sheet rubber was fixed as follows :—

Premium payable Price at Singapore for corresponding grade of rubber 5 pence . . • • Between 22 pence and 28 pence and at 28 pence 4 pence . . . . . • • • Between 28 pence and 40 pence and at 40 pence 3 pence . . . . . . . . Over 40 pence

Money and Banking 70. Money Supply.—The upward trend of the money supply in 1954 and 1955 con­tinued into 1956. After some decline in the first four months of the year, money supply rose almost steadily to reach a peak of Rs. 1,126-8 million at the end of 1956. At that point money supply was 5 • 0 per cent higher th an at the end of 1955.

73. Commercial Banks.—The main changes in the commercial banks' assets and liabilities position in 1956 are summarised below :—

(a) Total deposit liabilities rose to Rs. 1,020-7 million, an increase of Rs. 109-9.

I million (12-1 per cent). Inter-bank deposits however fell by Rs. 3-8 ; million. The increase in total deposits was the result of a rise of; Rs. 47 -2 million (6-3 per cont) in demand deposits and Rs. 62-7 million| (37-9 per cent) in time and savings deposits. In 1955 the proportionate; increases in demand and time and savings deposits were 14-9 per cent j and 12-8 per cent respectively. (

> Of the rise in total deposits excluding inter-bank deposits Rs. 35 -2j ! million was in respect of Government deposits and Rs. 78-5 million in; 1 respect of private deposits. • . i

I (6) Cash assets, comprising till money and balances with the Central Bank rose, ] from Rs. 169-9 million to:Rs. 183-8 million, arise of 8-2per cont. Thej j r^tio of cash to total deposits, however, fell slightly from 18-8 per! * cent to 18 1 per cent.

( 19 )

(c) Foreign balances, including unmatured export bills fell by Rs. 63-7 million.

(d) Credit to the private sector, that is, the sum of loans, overdrafts, import

and export bills rose by Rs. 83-4 million (25 • 8 per cent), the most signi­ficant increases being in overdrafts and import bills which rose by Rs. 63-4 million and Rs. 17-6 million respectively.

(e) Credit to the Government sector increased by Rs. 62-8 million; com­

mercial bank holdings of Government and Government guaranteed securities and Central Bank issues increased by Rs. 44-9 million while their holdings of Treasury Bills increased by only Rs. 17 -9 million.

(/) Total liquid assets fell by Rs. 14-6 million (3-2 per cent) to Rs. 436-7 million.

(g) Excess reserves rose slightly by Rs. 3-7 million to Rs. 59-4 million. As in the two previous years, tho figure for September—Rs. 83-2 million, was the highest for any month. It was also the highest since May, 1952.

Public Finance

75. Government Accounts.—The table on page 20 analyses the Government's accounts* for the financial year 1955-56 and the seven years preceding. The Government's operations in 1955-56 showed the following significant features:—

' vr (a) The Government had a small net cash operating deficit of Rs. 1 -2 million, as compared with surpluses of Rs. 33-7 million and Rs. 127-6 million : in 1953-54 and 1954-55 respectively. The two preceding years were the only surplus years in the period covered by the table.

(6) A small budget deficit occurred in spite of total revenue, at Rs. 1,257-2 million, being the highest level recorded so far for any financial year. The high revenue collections were largely the result of increased revenue from income tax, estate duty, stamps, etc. Revenue from customs duties, the other major category of revenue in Ceylon, was slightly lower than in the previous financial year.

Of the two main trading activities of the Government included in the budget, the railway continued to operate at a loss whilst the elec­trical department showed a profit. The railway had a doficit of Rs. 19-8 million in its operations as compared with a deficit of Rs. 17-7 million in 1954-55. The net profits of the electrical department in the two years amounted to Rs. 3 -5 million and Rs. 4-7 million, respectively.

(c) The sharp rise in expenditure chargeable to revenue was responsible for

the budget deficit. Expenditure chargeable to revenue rose by nearly Rs. 240 million over the previous year. Of this increaso, Rs. 50 million was for writing-off losses incurred by some Government trading activities in previous years, andRs. 79-5 million was for food subsidies. The bal­ance of the increase was mainly due to the increase in salaries of the public servants introduced in April, 1956, and to the increased expenditure on social services and on the maintenance of public utilities.

(d) Loan and loan fund expenditure was slightly lower than in the previous

year. This was due entirely to the reduced expenditure financed from the I.B.R.D. loan, on the Hydro-Electric Scheme. Such expenditure was only Rs. 5-2 million in 1955-56 in comparison with Rs. 12 1 million in 1954-55.

(e) Government borrowing and lending operations resulted in a net receipt of

Rs. 12-2 million which was utilised to finance the deficit of Rs. 1-2 million, the balance being used to augment Government's cash balance.

76. Government's local cash issues during the year amounted to Rs. 74-5 million of rupee loans and Rs. 8 0 million net of Treasury Bills. In addition withdrawals from the I.B.R.D. loan produced Rs. 5-2 million. These receipts were to a very large extent offset by contributions to public debt sinking funds as well as direct repayment of rupee loans from revenue, the repayment of quasi-dobt like deposits and the issue of loans to semi-Government institutions.

78. Government's capital expenditure increased over the previous year. This, as well as the sharp increase in current outlays, reduced the proportion of capital expenditure financed through the surplus on current account (i.e., the surplus of revenue over non-capital expenditure).

79. Public Debt.—The figures of public debt as at the end of each of the last four calendar years are given in the statements that follow. The figures in respect of financial years appear in Table 22.

80. Total net debt rose by Rs. 63 • 0 million as compared with a rise of Rs. 13-4 •million in 1955. The rise in 1956 was due to an increaso of Rs. 52-9 million in funded debt and Rs. 10 million in the floating debt. Total net debt at Rs. 961-4 million at the end of 1956 was 76-4 per cent of Government revenue during 1955-56. The comparable ratio for 1955 was 77-5 per cent. Tho slight fall in the ratio in spite of the increase in the net debt, is explained by the record level of revenue collected in 1955-56.

77. Capital Expenditure.—-The following tablo shows how Government's capital expenditure, budgetary as well as extra-budgetary, was financed :—

( 23 )

81. Funded Debt.—Gross funded debt increased by Rs. 71-6 million and net funded debt by Rs. 52 • 9 million. The increase in the gross funded debt in 1956, was the result of (a) the withdrawal of Rs. 8-9 million from the I.B.R.D. under the Loan Agreement signed in June, 1954, and (6) the rupee loan transactions undertaken in 1956.

82. In February, two loans were issued at par ; one for Rs. 25 • 1 million at 2J per cent and maturing between 1961 and 1963, and the other for Rs. 24-9 million at" 3J per cent maturing between 1976 and 1981. In November another loan for Rs. 30 million carrying 3 per cent interest and maturing between 1969 and 1972 was issued at par. In February, the Rs. 7-5 million of the 3 per cent loan 1956 which had not been converted in the December, 1955, loan operations, was repaid in cash, and in August the 3 J per cent National Loan, 1956, amounting to Rs. 9 -7 million was redeemed on maturity.

83. The three new loans issued for cash were fully subscribed and were allotted as follows:—

84. Sinking Funds.—The value of sinking funds established for the redemption of public dobt was Rs. 225-3 million at the end of December, 1956, as compared with Rs. 206-6 million at the end of December; 1955. In the course of theyear a sum of Rs. 3-4 million was appropriated out of the sinking funds to meet part of

( 24 )

the.repayment of the 3J per cent National Loan, 1956. The increase in the value of the sinking funds, despite this withdrawal was due to the contributions from revenue and the accrual of interest on their investments.

85. Floating Debt.—There was an increase of Rs. 10 million, in the floating debt in contrast with a decline of Rs. 55 0 million in 1955. Advances from the Central Bank and loans from semi-Government institutions remained nil throughout 1956 as in the previous year. The proportion of floating debt to total debt rose slightly.

( 25 )

90. The State Mortgage Bank debentures were issued in February and June. The first issuo was for Rs. 2-5 million at 2£ per cent with maturity dates of 1961-63 and the second was for Rs. 1 -75 million at 3 per cent with maturity dates of 1969-71. They were allotted as follows :—

Prices, Wages and Employment

92. The general level of retail prices, as measured by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index, showed no significant change over the year as a whole, though there were fluctuations within the year in the overall index.

93. In 1956, there was a downward trend in the 1st quarter, a rise in April followed by a steady decline till August, another rise in September and October and declines in November and December. The rises in April and October were largely due to

( 26 )

a rise in the prices of domestically produced goods, while the reduction in the sub­sidised price of rationed rice and in the price of sugar by 5 cents a pound each in May, which had the effect of lowering the overall index by 3 - 5 points, more than off­set the rise in the prices of domestically produced goods.

94. The import group index (a sub-group of the Colombo Consumers' Price Index covering imported consumption goods and having a weight of 44 per cent in the over­all index) was 3 - 9 per cent lower in 1956 than in 1955, while the prices of domestically produced and consumed goods were 1 -7 per cent higher and the export group index was 12-9 per cent higher.

95. Wages.—Wage rates of tea and rubber estate workers were 1 • 0 per cent higher in 1956 than in 1955. In trades other than Agriculture covored by the Wages Boards Ordinance, wage rates were 1 • 4 per cent higher. Real wages have, in general, moved with money wages during this period.

96. Employment.—Data on the number of registrants at the employment ex­changes are given below :—

97. The figures of registrants include both unemployed and those seeking better employment. The significance of the data is further limited by the fact that, in general, workers in the estate and rural sectors make little use of the exchanges.

* Estimated

99. The gross national product for 1956 is provisionally estimated to be Rs. 4,910 million, a decrease of 7 per cent over the previous year. This decline was chiefly due to (a) lower production of tea and coconuts ; (&) lower export prices for tea and rubber ; and (c) a decrease in the output of paddy following a drought.

Balance of Payments and External Assets

100. For the year 1956, balance of payments estimates (provisional) indicated a current account surplus of Rs. 75 • 1 million as compared with a surplus of Rs. 322-8 million for 1955. This large reduction in the surplus on current account was duo primarily to a considerable decline in the surplus on the merchandise account which fell steadily throughout the year. Furthermore, the deficit on current invisibles which for 1956, happens to be the largest so far recorded, showed a marked increase

as compared to the previous years due particularly to larger outward remittances on account of transportation and migrants' transfers.

101. On private remittances and migrants' transfers, there was a net outflow of Rs. 83-3 million, an increase of Rs. 5-8 million over the previous year. Transfers of assets of compulsory and voluntary repatriates to India continued to increaso during the year, and remittances for maintenance of dependants in India recorded a corresponding decline. On the transportation account the magnitude of the deficit increased by a considerable margin. This was mainly the result of an increase in froight charges during the year as well as a reduction in earnings through port expenditures and other disbursements of foreign ships at Colombo.

102. The net outflow on investment income was Rs. 55-4 million as compared with R s . 61 -3 million in the previous year. Larger earnings from increased foreign investments led to a decroase in the net outward payments on this account. The gross outflow of income from foreign investments in Ceylon, however, continued to be as high as in the previous year.

103. A deficit of Rs. 20-9 million was recorded in the private capital account during the year. Repatriation of foreign capital from Ceylon amounted to Rs. 51 -7 million as against Rs. 52 • 3 million for 1955. Inflow of foreign capital for investment in Ceylon was slightly highor during the year than in 1955,—being Rs. 5-4 million

as compared with Rs. 3-2 million in 1955. In contrast to the previous year, the transfer of surplus funds by sterling companies operating in Ceylon redueed their balances held in London by Rs. 12 -3 million.

Production and National Income

98. The production of the principal crops for the years 1955 and 1956 are compared below:—

104. During 1956, the external assets of official arid banking institutions increased by Rs. 58 0 million. This includes an increase of Rs. 33 1 million in the debt owed by the Government of China to the Government of Ceylon under the oxisting bilateral agreement. A liability of Rs. 8-9 million was incurred on the I.B.R.D. drawings during the year.
