    "text": "This Act enables Ceylon to become a member of the International Finance Corporation. Ceylon has paid $166,000 to the capital stock of the Corporation, as subscription to 166 shares. The purpose of the Corporation is to further economic development by encouraging the growth of productive private enterprise in member countries, particularly in less developed areas, thus supplementing the activities of the I.B.R.D. Towards this end the Corporation will in asso\u00adciation with private investors, contribute to the development of its member countries by making investments, without guarantee of repayment by the member government concerned, in cases where sufficient private capital is not available on reasonable terms. The Corporation will also seek to bring together investment opportunities, domestic and foreign private capital, and experienced management, and further stimulate the flow of private capital, domestic and foreign into productive investment in member countries. The existence of a government or. other public interest in such an enterprise shall not necessarily preclude the Corporation from making an investment therein. The Corporation and its officers are prohibited from interfering in the political affairs of any member country; nor can their decisions be influenced by the political character of the member country concerned, as only economic considerations shall be relevant to the decisions of the Corporation. The Corporation is an entity separate and distinct from the I.B.R.D. and the funds of the Corporation are to be kept separate and apart from those of the I.B.R.D. The Corporation is prohibited from lending or borrowing from the I.B.R.D. nor shall one be liable for the acts and obligations of the other. The Corporation acting through the I.B.R.D. is empowered to enter into formal arrangements with the United Nations or other public international organisations having specialised responsibilities in related fields. In order to enable the Corporation to fulfil the functions with which it is entrusted, the Corporation is vested with full judicial personality. Certain immunities and privileges are also granted to the Corporation such as immunity from seizure of its property and assets, inviolability of the Archives of the Corporation, privileges for its official communications and immunities from taxation.",
