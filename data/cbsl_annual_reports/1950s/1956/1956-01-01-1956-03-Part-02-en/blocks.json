Foreign trade in 1954 and 1955 had, indeed, experienced near-boom conditions and had contributed largely to an increased national income. There had been a marked rise in export values during those years, while the terms of trade\u2014which in the Ceylon economy might be regarded as a major determinant of real income\u2014had improved by as much as 34 per cent. In tho domestic sector, too, the economy had shown, on balance, an appreciable expansion in physical output, reflecting in particular a remarkable increase in the production of paddy. Government finances had changed from a deficit position in 1953 to a surplus in 1954 and 1955. The volume of private savings had risen, and the balance of payments in each of these two years revealed large surpluses.",

Among the factors bringing about the less favourable economic situation in 1956 should be mentioned the severe drought that was experienced in Ceylon in the year, the less strong world demand for tea than in 1955, higher import costs at sources of foreign supply, labour unrest in the port of Colombo, increases in ocean transport charges, and finally the dislocation caused by the Suez crisis. It is, perhaps, too early yet to attempt to assess the full economic consequences of this last factor, but a shortage of shipping space was experienced in the second half of 1956, generally restricting access to markets abroad. A freight surcharge of 15 per cent was imposed from November, and following upon the previous freight increase of 10 per cent effected from March, raised to some extent the costs of financing foreign trade. The effect on import prices was unfavourable and, though pressures induced by the crisis for stock-piling abroad tended to raise in Colombo the prices of exports to Western Markets whenever shipping space was available, tho volume of exports on the whole showed a decline. The harbour strikes in Colombo created difficulties of a different type, aggravating the intermittent congestion in the port and delaying further the loading and unloading of cargoes. In addition to hampering exports, these delays caused temporary shortages of imported supplies.",

The rise in 1956 in the volume of imports, in spite of the contractionary effect on real income of the factors mentioned earlier, would require some explana\u00adtion, particularly since the volume of imports might have been even higher but for shipping difficulties. Among the reasons was, firstly, the expansionary influence on private income of Government budgetary operations in 1956 in relation to 1955. In 1956,Government ran a net cash operating deficit* of about lis.43 million following upon a net cash operating surplus of about Rs. 40 million for 1955. Secondly, the decrease in domestic output, mainly in paddy production due chiefly to unfavourable weather conditions in 1956, necessitated some additional resort to imports. Thirdly there was the lag in imports associated with higher incomes in the previous year. Fourthly, some increase in personal expenditure probably occurred as a result of the celebration of Buddha Jayanti.f The rise in imports had, of course, to be financed by a net reduction in the current savings of the economy, although savings in certain sections of the private sector had, in fact, increased appreciably.",

In 1954 and 1955, money supply had expanded by Rs. 130 million and Rs. 116 million, respectively ; but the increases in money supply in those years were much less than the increases in external banking assets, mainly because Government through its financial operations had exerted a net contractionary influence on the money supply. In 1956, too, although the Government deficit had a net expansionary effect on incomes, the Government sector's borrowing operations had a contractionary influence on the money supply. Yet the money supply rose by about Rs. 54 million in 1956. The reason was that\u2014in contrast to the position in 1954 and 1955\u2014the increase in the money supply in 1956 was mainly due to an expansion in bank credit to the privato sector. This credit expansion largely reflected an increase in over\u00addrafts, mainly for the financing of export and import stocks.

In a country such as Ceylon, whose economy is considerably dependent on the export of primary products which are subject to sharp price changes, a major aim of fiscal and monetary policy is the control, as far as possible, of extreme fluctuations in disposable income; for such fluctuations can cause serious adverse effects on savings and investments, and hence on the long term growth of national income. In an open economy the control of such fluctuations is essential if periodical crises relating to the balance of payments are to be avoided.",

The role of monetary policy is, for the most part, auxiliary and supplemental, thotigh never\u00adtheless important; its effectiveness in influencing the money supply, and particularly in regulating credit, largely depends on the appropriateness and timing of fiscal measures. These moasures should in boom times be directed towards taxing away",
