The sharp decrease in output of the Oils and Fats Company Limited was due to the termination of production activities since July, 1991 in order to make pre-arrangements for privatisation. The output of Lanka Loha Hardware declined on account of a short supply of raw materials during the year. The reduced output level of National Salt Corporation was mainly due to the production shortfalls in salterns of Elephant Pass and Puttalam. The decrease in output of the Sri Lanka Sugar Company Ltd. was entirely due to the low levels of production recorded at Kantalai, Hingurana and Sevenagala factories as a result of short supply of sugar cane. The disruptions caused to electricity supplies and continuing civil disturbances in the region had an adverse impact on the production of Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation.",
