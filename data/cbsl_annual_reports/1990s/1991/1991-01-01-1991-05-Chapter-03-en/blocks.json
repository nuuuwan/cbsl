Unfavourable weather conditions coupled with intensified civil disturbances in the Northern and Eastern provinces contributed to a setback in the pro\u00adduction of certain crops in this sector. However, in 1991, tea and sugar production reached record levels ever achieved in the country. Of the minor food crops, big onion and sesame seed production recorded improved performance compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, paddy, rubber and coconut production declined by 6 per cent, 8 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively over the previous year. A number of minor export crops too recorded reduced production compared to the previous year.",

The area newly planted with rubber by the SLSPC increased by 17 per cent from 152 hectares in 1990 to 178 hectares in 1991, while that of JEDBs dropped by 83 hectares or 78 per cent to 23 hectares.",

The average yield during the 1990/91 Maha season in both the major and minor irrigated areas increased by 6 per cent each over the previous Maha season, while the average yield of the rainfed areas increased by 4 per cent. In contrast, the average yields in the major and minor irrigated and rainfed areas in Yala, 1991 recorded decreases of 7 per cent, 8 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, when compared with those of the previous Yala season.",

The production of red onion recorded a decrease due to a substantial drop in the extent under cultivation despite an increase in the annual average yield. Reduction in the extent of red onion cultivation was largely attributed to a short supply of seed material on account of civil disturbances in the Northern and Eastern provinces. Production of potato which recorded a 10 per cent decrease in the previous year dropped again in 1991. This was due to a substantial decrease in the extent under cultivation despite an increase in the annual average yield. The drop in the extent under cultivation of potato was attributed to the non-availability of seed potato due to an infection of the soils in the Nuwara Eliya District.",

    "text": "The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has provisionally estimated fish production in 1991 at 198,063 metric tons indicating an increase of 12 per cent when compared with a 14 per cent drop recorded during the previous year. This recovery in fish production could be attributed to the improvement of the security situation in the Eastern province as well as the substantial increase in subsidy payments under the vari\u00adous subsidy schemes for fishery development activities. Fish production of the coastal fishery sub-sector which accounted for 80 per cent of the total fish production increased by 19 per cent, from 134,132 metric tons in 1990 to 159,151 metric tons in 1991. In contrast, the fish production of the inland fishery sub-sector declined by 24 per cent to 23,832 metric tons in 1991. Production in the off-shore and deep sea sub-sector rose by 29 per cent to 15,080 metric tons. As in the past, the private sector continued to dominate the fishery sector accounting for the largest share of total fish production. The total fish supply of the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation (CFC) in 1991 estimated at 1,936 metric tons showed a 6 per cent decrease over the supply of the previous year. Ice production of the CFC at 6,026 metric tons was 10 per cent lower than the production in 1990. The work in respect of fisheries development projects, viz. the West Coast Fishery Development Project and the East Coast Fishery Development Project in 1991 was restricted to monitoring and maintenance activities since both projects were completed at the end of 1990.",

Under the various subsidy schemes, 679 boats, 1,527 traditional crafts and 408 motors were issued to the marine sector. Meanwhile, 134 additional multi-day boats were introduced for deep sea and off-shore fishing activities in 1991 with a view to exploiting untapped resources available in the deep sea and off-shore areas. During the year, the management of fisheries activities improved mainly through fisheries co-operative societies. The number of Fisheries Co-operative Societies (FCSS) formed in 1991 increased by 48 per cent to 787. As a result, the total membership of FCSS moved up from 60,000 in 1990 to 75,000 in 1991. Despite the increase in the level of production, the average prices of all varieties of fish increased during 1991.",
