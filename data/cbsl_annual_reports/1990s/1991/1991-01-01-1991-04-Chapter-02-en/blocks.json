This increase, though lower than the impres\u00adsive growth of 6.2 per cent in the previous year, indicates that the growth impulses generated in response to further liberalisation measures and other policy reforms intro\u00adduced since 1989 have been sustained. The Gross National Product (GNP), the sum of GDP and net factor income from abroad, recorded a growth of 4.7 per cent in real terms compared with the growth of 6.4 per cent in 1990. This sustained growth performance was in sharp contrast to the average annual growth rate in GNP of 3.5 per cent during the five year period preceding 1990.",

Its expansion has contributed to almost 25 per cent of the overall growth of GDP in 1991. In comparison, it contributed 26 per cent in 1990. These indicators reflect the growing importance of the Manufacturing sector in stimulating economic growth in recent years. Led by the export oriented textiles and garments industry, value-added in factory industry, which contributes around two-thirds of the total output in the Manufacturing Sector, expanded by 9.5 per cent in real terms.",

In 1991, this sector expanded by only 2.9 per cent. Further, the setback in the Mining and Quarrying sector as well as the slowing down in public sector construction activities were the other factors that contributed to a slower rate of growth in the economy in 1991. Moreover, the spurt of economic activity in 1990 was achieved over a low level of economic activity and capacity utilisation in 1989, which had been affected by sporadic civil disturbances and orchestrated work stoppages. This is a factor which has to be considered when comparing the relative performance of the economy in 1990 and 1991.",
