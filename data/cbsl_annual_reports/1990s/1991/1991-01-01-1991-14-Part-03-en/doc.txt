Xffl

2) The proposed currency exchange by the Central Bank of Kuwait will take place only up to 30.09.1991. However, with effect from 07.05.1991, the currency notes withdrawn from circulation ceased to be legal tender for the State of Kuwait and dealing in such currency notes is forbidden.

3) Holders of Kuwaiti Dinar currency notes withdrawn from circulation residing outside the State of Kuwait can present such currency notes to any of the banks operating in Kuwait either through their branches operating outside Kuwait or through their correspondents in Kuwait up to 30.09.1991. These notes shall be exchanged at face value. The value of currency notes exchanged shall be depos­ited in the accounts of the concerned foreign banks held with the Kuwaiti banks.

4) Accordingly, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has arranged the following Exchange Programme for Kuwaiti Dinar currency notes withdrawn from circulation but still held or partly sold to commercial banks by persons employed and returned from Kuwait on or after 02.08.1990.

(i) Persons who were employed in Kuwait and returned to Sri Lanka on or after 02.08.1990 and have sold Kuwaiti Dinar currency notes on or after 16.10.1990, to commercial banks in Sri Lanka but not received the Sri Lanka Rupee equivalent in full, would be entitled to claim the balance in Sri Lanka Rupees once those currency notes are accepted by the Central Bank of Kuwait and value is remitted to Sri Lanka. The conversion of such remittances to Sri Lanka Rupees would be made after taking into account the cost of airfreight, insurance, handling and other charges in­cluding commissions charged by correspondent bank/s. The payments in Sri Lanka Rupees will be arranged through the commercial banks to whom Kuwaiti Dinar currency notes were sold. An announcement on the appropriate procedure to be followed by such persons will be issued by the Central Bank in due course.

(ii) Persons employed in Kuwait and returned to Sri Lanka on or after 02.08.1990 and who are still holding Kuwaiti Dinar currency notes with­drawn from circulation could now surrender them to commercial banks on presentation of following documents:-

(a) A letter issued by the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training to the effect that the person concerned has been employed in Kuwait and has returned to Sri Lanka on or after August 02, 1990. In case where a person has already surrendered to a commercial bank a portion of his Kuwaiti Dinar currency holdings in terms of the Cen­tral Bank's previous Press announcement by furnishing a letter from the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training to the commercial bank concerned and if such commercial bank has on record the receipt of the letter from the Ministry so submitted there will be no necessity for a further letter to be obtained from that Ministry.

(b) The Passport/any other valid travel document with an endorsement to the effect that the person concerned has embarked from a port, airport or any other exit point in a Middle East country on or after

x r v

August 02, 1990 and disembarked on that date or thereafter, at an airport or seaport in Sri Lanka.

(c) The Passport/any other valid travel document with an endorsement at the port of arrival/in Sri Lanka by the Sri Lanka Customs to the effect that the amount of Kuwaiti Dinar currency notes have been brought to Sri Lanka by persons concerned; where there is no en­dorsement in these documents made by the Sri Lanka Customs with regard to currency notes brought in, the letter issued by the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training must include that the currency held by the person concerned had been genuinely earned in Kuwait. This would mean that persons other than those who have returned from employment from Kuwait after the date referred to above will not be qualified to surrender Kuwaiti Dinar currency notes under this programme.

(d) A declaration made in duplicate by persons surrendering the Kuwaiti Dinar currency notes in a special form prepared for this purpose and obtainable from the commercial bank concerned.

(iii) Commercial banks will accept such currency notes with acknowledge­ment/endorsement in the Passport/any other valid travel document.
