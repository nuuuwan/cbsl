This, although still high in absolute terms, represents a very commendable improvement over the corresponding annual average increase of 21.5 per cent experienced in 1990. Reflecting the declining trend in the level of price changes, the point to point increase in the Colombo Consumers' Price Index in December, 1991 (i.e., December 1991 over December 1990) was 9.0 per cent, in contrast to the higher increase of 19.6 per cent in December 1990. The decline in the rate of price increases was apparent at the primary market level as well, with the Wholesale Price Index registering an annual average increase of only 9.2 per cent in 1991. The corresponding increase in 1990 was 22.2 per cent.",

The rise in prices experienced in the second quarter was dampened in the third quarter with the commencement of the Yala harvest. In fact, the overall price level declined in the third quarter.

This was in contrast to a decline of 7 per cent in 1990. A breakdown of this aggregate real wage index into its constituent elements revealed that Non-Executive Officers suffered a slight reduction in their real wages, whereas Minor Employees enjoyed a small increase in their real wages. Government School Teachers however continued to suffer a deterioration in their real wages, though the decrease in real wages was smaller in 1991 than in 1990.",

Employment in government institutions, which included central government ministries and departments as well as the provincial government and local government sub sectors, was estimated to be 652,600 at the end of 1991, registering an increase of 0.6 per cent over 1990. The increase in total employment was mainly due to the growth in employment in the Service Worker category inclusive of defence services personnel. This category comprised a large proportion of casual employees. When Service Workers are excluded, employment in the rest of the government sector declined by 6.8 per cent. In the semi-government sub sector which includes Public Corporations, Statutory Boards, Government Owned Business Undertakings and State Banks, overall employment was estimated to have dropped by 6.9 per cent. t",

School teachers who accounted for 73.4 per cent of total employment within the government sub-sector re\u00adcorded a decline in employment of 4.4 per cent. This was largely due to many teachers opting for early retirement under the incentive scheme. In contrast, the number of doctors in the government sub-sector increased by 9.8 per cent to 4,500 as a result of appoint\u00adments given to the back-log of medical graduates passing out since the re-opening of Universities. Clerical and Related Workers in the total state sector were estimated at 202,700 in 1991 reflecting a decrease of 8.0 per cent during the year.
