    "text": "Despite a continuing tight monetary policy stance, the rate of monetary expansion further accelerated in 1991. This was mainly due to a significant improvement in the external assets (net) of the banking system and continued high growth in domestic credit. The narrow money supply (M,), consisting of currency and demand deposits held by the public, registered an annual increase of 18 per cent at the end of 1991 compared with 13 per cent at the end of 1990. Similarly, the annual increase of broad money supply (Mj), comprising M, plus time and savings deposits held by the public with the commercial banks, rose from 19 per cent to 23 per cent over the two periods. The expansion in monetary aggregates recorded a marginal deceleration during the first four months of 1991 but accelerated thereafter with marginal fluctuations. The annual growth of M ( which declined from 13 per cent at the end of 1990 to 9 per cent in April, 1991 acceler\u00adated thereafter reaching 18 per cent at the end of the year. Following a similar trend, the growth of broad money supply decelerated from 19 per cent at the end of 1990 to 15 per cent in April, 1991 but reversed thereafter reaching 25 per cent in November before declining to 23 per cent in December, 1991. In view of the continued high expansion in money and credit during the year, the Central Bank was obliged to further strengthen the contractionary monetary policy stance that was in place by the end of 1990 in order to arrest the expansion of monetary and credit aggregates.",

On the source side, a large increase of Rs.8,811 million in net foreign assets of the Central Bank was responsible for the expansion in the monetary base. In contrast, the net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central Bank declined by Rs.334 million during the year. Despite an increase of Rs.2,351 million in net credit to the government, the NDA of the Central Bank declined in 1991 due to a significant reduction of Rs. 1,986 million in refinance facilities from the Bank and a net increase of other items by Rs.699 million. On the use side, the expansion was reflected in increases in both the currency issue of the Bank (Rs.3,622 million) and the deposits (Rs.4,854 million).",

The policy measures introduced in 1991 included an upward revision of Bank rate, rationalization of refinance schemes, increase in the cash reserve ratio of commer\u00adcial banks and further intensification of Open Market Operation (OMO) activities",

Meanwhile, bank credit to the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) declined from Rs.3,856 million at the end of 1990 to Rs.2,836 million at the end of 1991. This was made possible by the disposal of certain investments (sale of shares) and economizing on administrative costs. However, credit requirements of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation increased substantially by Rs.2,663 million during the year due to continuing losses, high prices for several imported materi\u00adals and high interest costs.

The expansion in the NFA of the Central Bank was wholly reflected in an increase of Rs. 12,765 million in cash balances abroad including Treasury bills. This was, partially offset by an increase in deposits of international organizations by Rs.3,746 million during the year. The drop in net external assets of the commercial banks is mainly attributable to an increase in Non-Resident Foreign Currency (NRFC) and Resi\u00addent Non-National Foreign Currency (RNNFC) deposit liabilities amounting to Rs.3,220 million during the year.

The total value of credit extended under the NCRCS in 1991 amounted to Rs. 1,052 million registering an increase of 81 per cent over its level in the previous year. This expansion was due to a rise in the number of loans by 41 per cent covering a correspondingly higher acreage, as well as an upward revision in the scales of finance facilities which came into effect during Maha 1990/91. Another contributory factor for the significant increase in the value of credit during the year was the greater involvement of RRDBs in the scheme. Loans for paddy comprised the greater share of loans granted under the Scheme.",

In all, the total deposits of the NSB rose by Rs.3,341 million or 14 per cent in 1991 as compared with an increase of Rs.3,153 million or 16 per cent in the previous year. The reduced rate of growth in deposits can be partly attributed to the reduction in the interest rate offered on its savings deposits from 16.2 per cent to 14 per cent in July and the withdrawal of the tax exemp\u00adtion on one-third interest income. In the composition of deposits, a shift from savings deposits to fixed deposits was observed during the year in view of the comparatively more attractive rates offered for the latter category of deposits. Accordingly, savings deposits registered a moderate growth of 8 per cent in 1991 compared to a 20 per cent growth recorded in 1990, while fixed deposits rose by 19 per cent as against 13 per cent in 1990.",

During 1991, the activities of the merchant banks increased significantly with the total turnover almost doubling during the year as compared with the previous year.

In order to activate secondary market activities, the Central Bank reduced the difference between discount and re-discount rates from 5 percentage points to 2 percentage points by adjust\u00ading the re-discount rate downwards. A net sale position was witnessed during most months of the year. The secondary market rates were continuously adjusted to reflect the variations in the primary market rates. Accordingly, the discount rate declined from 15.50 per cent at the end of 1990 to 14.75 per cent at the end of 1991 with some marginal fluctuations in between, while the re-discount rate declined from 20.5 per cent to 16.75 per cent over the same period.",
