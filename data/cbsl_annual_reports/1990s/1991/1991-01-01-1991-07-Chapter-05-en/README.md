ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OVERHEADS

ENERGY

The demand for electricity continued to expand in 1991. Although, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was able to meet this increased demand through hydro power, the thermal power generation also rose during the year due to lower levels of water in some of the reservoirs. Meanwhile, domestic consumption of diesel and kerosene contin­ued to expand due to the relative price advantage of these products. Moreover, the demand for heavy diesel was further augmented in 1991 due to a substantial increase in the use of heavy diesel by the CEB for operating thermal plants. However, the demand for super petrol declined by 11 per cent in 1991 owing to high prices prevailing during the year.

Non-commercial energy sources consisting of fuelwood, agricultural residues, ani­mal waste, together with other ligno cellulosic matter continued to be the largest sources of energy. These sources which were estimated at 4.8 mn. tons of oil equivalent (t.o.e.) of energy represented 71 per cent of the total energy supply in the country, while petro­leum, electricity, liquified petroleum gas (IPG) and a small quantity of coal and lignite accounted for the rest.

During the year under review, the total capacity of electricity generation remained unchanged at 1,290 MW. The installed capacity of hydro power stood at 1,017 MW while the installed capacity of thermal power remained at 272 MW. Meanwhile, the total power generated by the CEB in 1991, at 3,377 million kWh marked an increase of 7 per cent. However, total hydro electricity generation at 3,116 million kWh in 1991 recorded a marginal decline of 1 per cent due to lower levels of water in the reservoirs. Conse­quently, the thermal power generation rose substantially to 260 million kWh during 1991 from a negligible level of 5 million kWh during the previous year, adding with notable balance of payments implications. Meanwhile, the losses involved in the process of power generation and transmission declined to 567 million kWh or about 17 per cent of total generation as compared with 589 million kWh or about 19 per cent in 1990.

The sales of electricity during the year under review totalled 2,810 million kWh. This was an increase of 8 per cent compared to a rise of 11 per cent in 1990. Sales to the domestic sector rose by 27 per cent largely due to an increase in the number of consumers from 629 thousand in 1990 to 765 thousand in 1991. Meanwhile, sales to the commercial and industrial sectors rose by 12 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively as compared to increases of 16 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively in 1990. However, bulk sales to local authorities declined by 8 per cent during the period under review. Meanwhile, the electricity tariff structure which was revised in April, 1990 remained unchanged through­out 1991.

Domestic consumption of petroleum products at 1,203 thousand metric tons (1,439 million litres) in 1991 was an increase of 8 per cent. Reflecting the relative price differentials, the demand for auto diesel totalling 5,40 thousand metric tons (638 million litres) registered an increase of 5 per cent in 1991'while the demand for super petrol to the tune of 160 thousand metric tons (210 million litres) recorded a decline of 11 per

cent. Meanwhile, the consumption of kerosene rose to 173 thousand metric tons (220 million litres) in 1991 from 167 thousand metric tons (213 million litres) in 1990. In keeping with the continuing growth momentum in industrial activities, sales of furnace oil rose by 27 per cent in 1991 as compared with an increase of 6 per cent in the previous year. The sales of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) too rose by 10 per cent to 37,522 metric tons in 1991. Prices of all petroleum products except furnace oil and bitumen remained unchanged throughout the year.

The total expenditure on petroleum imports at SDR 22S million (Rs. 12,887 million) accounted for 10 per cent of total imports in 1991. The average price of crude oil per barrel decreased to US Dollars 19.50 (Rs. 807) in 1991 from US Dollars 23.53 (Rs. 943) in 1990. Moreover, the volume of crude oil imports also declined to 1,626 thousand metric tons in 1991 from 1,779 thousand metric tons in 1990 largely due to the closure of the oil refinery for maintenance during February, 1991. Consequently, the volume of imports of refined products rose from 124,986 metric tons in 1990 to 215,753 metric tons in 1991. Meanwhile, the volume of petroleum products exports at 523,211 metric tons in 1991 recorded a decline of 16 per cent. This, together with lower petroleum prices in 1991, contributed to a reduction in the export earnings from petroleum products from SDR 73 million (Rs. 3,974 million) in 1990 to SDR 58 million (Rs. 3,289 million) in 1991.

TRANSPORTATION

The activities of the transport sector showed an improvement in 1991. The operated kilometres of the Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) which increased sharply by 28 per cent in the previous year rose by a further 4 per cent in 1991 due to an expansion in train services. The passenger transport service also continued to expand with the importation of more than 3,000 buses during 1991. This expansion was facilitated by the credit facilities provided by the National Development Bank (NDB) and tax concessions of­fered by the Government. Meanwhile, with a view to improving the omnibus passenger transport the government established the National Transport Commission in September, 1991. Furthermore, the disparity in bus fares was corrected by bringing the private bus fares in line with those of the Sri Lanka Transport Board.

The scale of operations of the SLR in terms of operated kilometers increased by 4 per cent and stood at 8 million in 1991. Although, the passenger kilometerage at 2,698 million recorded a decline of 3 per cent over the previous year, the freight services indicated by cargo ton kilometerage, at 170 million recorded an increase of 4 per cent. Continued civil disturbances in the northern and eastern provinces had its impact over the performance of rail services in these regions. During 1991, the railway service on the Thalaimannar line was suspended and the services on the Northern and Batticaloa lines were curtailed. However, the overall adverse impact of the reduced scale of operations of the SLR in these regions was mitigated by an expansion in train services in the rest of the country. Five new trains were introduced on the Colombo - Puttalam line from June, 1991 while a new train service was also launched between Colombo Fort and Ragama. The train service between Colombo and Badulla was also extended to facilitate weekend travellers. Moreover, with a view to providing an improved commuter service in subur­ban areas, 20 new diesel hydraulic trains were commissioned during 1991. Reflecting these improvements, the total revenue of the SLR rose by 13 per cent to Rs. 656 million.

66

However, with an operational expenditure of Rs. 1,240 million the SLR increased its operational loss to Rs. 584 million in 1991 from Rs. 276 million in the previous year

In 1991, omnibus passenger transport services expanded considerably. The total number of buses including private omnibus as registered with the Department of Motor Traffic was 3,176 as compared to 1,149 in the previous year. The private sector imported 1,073 buses in 1991 as compared to 731 buses in 1990 using the credit facilities provided by the NDB.

HOUSING

The One Point Five Million Houses Programme (OPFMHP), which stretches over the six year period commencing from 1990 to assist 1.5 million families by providing loans and grants to construct new houses, upgrade existing houses and improve shelter conditions of the poor, made considerable headway in 1991. The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) which is responsible for the implementation of the two major housing sub programmes under the OPFMHP reached 34,733 families in 1991 as

67

compared with 33,677 families in 1990. Moreover, under the Rural Housing Sub Pro­gramme (RHSP), the largest single sub programme of the OPFMHP, loans were provided to 29,704 families with a maximum of Rs. 12,500 per family. A total of 25,372 housing . units was also completed during 1991 with a loan disbursement of Rs.258 million.

Under the Urban Housing Sub Programme (UHSP), a total of 5,029 low income families was provided with credit facilities for the development of housing conditions among urban low income families. Meanwhile, a total sum of Rs. 128 million was disbursed among 13,707 loan recipients and 4,004 housing units were completed under the Disaster Housing Sub Programme (DHSP).

The Plantation Housing sub Programme (PHSP) implemented by the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) and the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) made satisfactory progress except for the re-roofing programme which was delayed due to the late importation of roofing sheets. According to provisional data, the JEDB was able to complete 119 new houses while upgrading 534 housing units in 1991. Meanwhile, the SLSPC completed 40 new houses and upgraded 30 housing units. A further 1,924 houses in the JEDB and 3,265 houses in the SLSPC were also provided with latrine facilities during the year under review. In 1991, the Mahaweli Economic Agency (MEA) which is responsible for the implementation of the Mahaweli Housing Sub Programme (MHSP) provided Rs. 18 million by way of financial assistance to 4,721 farming families in Systems H, B, C and L.

Meanwhile, the major banking and financial institutions continued their loan schemes for the development of housing activities in the private sector. The State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMD3) continuing its function as the leading lending institution for housing and real estate development sanctioned a total of 2,055 housing

loans to the tune of Rs. 282 million during 1991. However, the number of loans under the housing loan scheme of the SMH3 declined by 22 per cent over the previous year. In 1991, the National Savings Bank (NSB) also granted Rs. 66 million for housing purposes in respect of 565 individuals as against Rs. 70 million granted to 591 applicants during 1990. The interest rates charged on housing loans by the SMTB and the NSB varied from 19 per cent to 20.5 per cent and from 18 per cent to 22 per cent, respectively during the year. During the year under review, the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank dis­bursed housing loans amounting to Rs. 687 million and Rs. 384 million, respectively. Meanwhile, the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) of Sri Lanka Lim­ited, granted housing loans to 524 applicants amounting to Rs. 52 million, as compared with 113 loans to the value of Rs. 12 million approved in the previous year. The HDFC also expanded its branch network establishing branches in Galle, Kegalle, Gampaha and Kalutara during 1991.

URBAN DEVELOPMENT

Reflecting increased activities, the expenditure on urban development rose sharply from Rs. 315 million in 1990 to Rs.1,184 million in 1991. Of the total expenditure, Rs. 943 million or 80 per cent was spent on social and cultural projects, while Rs. 87 million was on projects undertaken on behalf of clients. Meanwhile, a sum of Rs. 89 million was incurred for the purchase of under-developed or unutilised land by the land bank. A further sum of Rs. 61 million was spent on integrated and industrial development projects.

ROADS AND RAIL TRACKS

The road net work maintained by the Road Development Authority (RDA) in 1991 totalled 10,448 kilometres. The RDA also maintained 3,244 bridges. Meanwhile, the total investment on the construction of roads amounted to Rs. 1,529 million while the expenditure on the maintenance of roads totalled Rs. 177 million.

Under the Trunk Road Improvement Project funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), almost all the drainage structures on Omaragolla-Dambulla-Anuradhapura road were completed during the year. Meanwhile, in 1991 the Homagama - Avissawella -Hatton road was completed under the Second Road Improvement Project funded by the ADB.

As in the previous year, the railtrack kilometerage remained unchanged at 1,944 kilometres in 1991. However, the rehabilitation work on the rail tracks from Galle to Kandy and from Ragama to Negombo, which carry the rail traffic of highest intensity commenced in October, 1991.

COMMUNICATION SERVICES

A salient feature of the telecommunication sector in 1991 was the establishment of the "Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT)" to take over the telecommunication services hitherto provided by the Department of Telecommunications. The main objective of the SLT is to provide a reliable and efficient telecommunication network.

69

During the year, the demand for telecommunication facilities continued to remain high. Although, there were 61,313 applications for new telephones, the Department of Telecommunications and Sri Lanka Telecom were able to provide only 6,579 new lines in 1991 compared with 10,241 in 1990. Accordingly, the total number of telephone lines provided to the public increased marginally by 4 per cent to 125,834 in 1991. Mean­while, the total number of telex connections rose by 4 per cent to 1,740 in 1991. The total overseas telephone traffic expanded by 62 per cent while the overseas telegrams and overseas telex traffic declined by 14 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively during the year under review.

Meanwhile, the major development activities consisting of upgrading and rehabilita­tion of the existing telecommunication network continued in 1991. The major projects that were in progress during the year included General Development of Telecommunica­tion Services, Contribution of Capital to Global Commercial Communication Satellite System - Overseas Telecommunication Services, Improvement of Telecommunication Network in the Greater Colombo Area (Phase II) and the improvement of telecommuni­cation network in the Gampaha District. Moreover, building construction of the Matara District Telecommunication Network Development Project was completed.

During the year under review, the number of articles handled by the Postal Depart­ment declined marginally by 0.4 per cent to 518 million from 519 million in 1990, mainly due to the decreased handling of inland parcels and foreign mail. Inland parcel handling declined marginally by 0.7 per cent to 586,000 in 1991, while foreign mail handling declined by 3 per cent to 69 million. However, the inland mail handling increased marginally to 446 million in 1991 from 445.8 million in 1990. Meanwhile, the foreign parcel handling remained at the same level of 71,000 as in the previous year.

The post office network expanded to 3,982 in 1991 from 3,945 in 1990. Accord­ingly, the area served by a post office fell marginally from 16.6 square-kilometres in 1990 to 16.5 square-kilometres in 1991, indicating increased availability and access to postal services for the public. Meanwhile, the number of letters per inhabitant dropped marginally to 28 in 1991 from 29 in 1990.

JANASAVIYA PROGRAMME

The first round of the Janasaviya Programme (JSP) which commenced in October, 1989 with 154,345 families in 28 AGA Divisions spanning all districts in Sri Lanka completed its 24 months of regular support for consumption by September, 1991. Moreover, the second round initiated in December, 1990 with 104,080 families in 22 AGA divisions was in progress in 1991. The total expenditure on account of providing consumption support to Janasaviya beneficiaries under the first and second rounds of the programme in 1991 amounted to Rs. 3,497 million. The JSP since its inception upto end of 1991 channelled a total sum of Rs. 7,114 million to provide consumption support for the poor. Meanwhile, total cumulative savings generated out of consumption allowance amounted to Rs.1,048 million at the end of 1991.

Income generating activities providing over Rs. 1,000 per month per family have been created for over 92 per cent of the Janasaviya families covered under the first round. Most of the Janasaviya beneficiaries found employment opportunities in different projects such as agriculture and animal husbandry, fisheries, industry, trade and others.

The JSP beneficiaries were also assisted with credit facilities for viable projects with a view to promoting income generating activities on a sustainable basis. Accordingly, financial institutions such as the Bank of Ceylon, the People's Bank, Rural Banks, Re­gional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) and other sources channelled a total sum of Rs. 655 million in 1991 for the self employment projects initiated by the Janasaviya families.

SCHOOL MID-DAY MEAL PROGRAMME

The mid-day meal programme which was introduced in 1989 with a view to improv­ing the nutritional conditions of school going children benefited 4,230,637 students in 1991. The expenditure on this programme was contained at Rs. 1,402 million in 1991 as compared to Rs. 1,644 million in the previous year through better targeting.

HEALTH

The Government channelled a total sum of Rs. 5,240 million or 4.4 per cent of total expenditure in 1991 to health services. This was an increase of 6 per cent over the previous year. While current expenditure on health rose by 12 per cent to Rs. 4,110 million, the capital expenditure declined by 12 per cent to Rs. 1,130 million in 1991.

In 1991, a total of 504 government hospitals with a bed strength of about 45,600 provided health care facilities to around 31 million patients. In addition, the private sector also provided services through 79 hospitals located mainly in urban centres.

MAHAWELI PROGRAMME v

The main focus of the Mahaweli Programme during 1991 was on agricultural devel­opment activities in the systems. Settlement of families also continued under the differ­ent systems during the year. Under the enterprise development activities several self employment projects commenced in 1991. Work on the peripheral development activi­ties under the Mahaweli' Programme was mainly undertaken in the Kotmale area. The total expenditure incurred under the Mahaweli Programme in 1991 amounted to Rs. 2,456 million, of which approximately Rs. 1,496 million or 61 per cent was spent on the systems development activities: System 'B' (Rs. 522 million), System 'C' (Rs. 744 million), System 'G' (Rs. 35 million) and System 'L' (Rs. 70 million).

During 1991,1,529 gigawatt hours (gWh) of energy were generated by the six hydro power projects coming under the Mahaweli project. This was a decrease of 11 per cent over the total energy generated under the Mahaweli programme in 1990. The energy generated by the Victoria (483 gWh), Kotmale (348 gWh), Randenigala (277 gWh) and Bowatenna (57 gWh) declined by 21 per cent, 17 per cent, 17 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively over the energy generated in the previous year. In contrast, the energy generated under Rantambe (170 gWh) and Ukuwela (194 gWh) showed increases of 73 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively. Rantambe which was commissioned in the first half

of 1990 came into a full year's operation during 1991 resulting in a substantial increase in the generation of power during the year. The total energy generated under the Mahaweli programme in 1991 accounted for 45 per cent of the national power supply.

According to provisional data provided by the Mahaweli Authority, the total extent cultivated under the Mahaweli Command Area increased by 6 per cent to 119,034 hec­tares in 1991. The extent cultivated in the Mahaweli Command Area which rose by 40 per cent during Maha, 1989/90 showed a further increase of 7 per cent during Maha 1990/91 to 68,140 hectares. The extent cultivated in Yala which recorded a substantial increase of 63 per cent during 1990 recorded a further rise of 4 per cent during Yala, 1991 raising the land area under cultivation to 50,894 hectares.

The total extent under paddy in the Mahaweli Command Area which increased by 38 per cent in 1990 recorded a further expansion of 7 per cent to 98,162 hectares in 1991. However, the extent under other crops which recorded a more than two-fold increase in 1990 declined by 2 per cent to 20,872 hectares in 1991.

The total number of families settled under the Mahaweli Programme during 1991 declined by 33 per cent to 5,985 families when compared with the settlements in the previous year. Of this, 3,240 families or 54 per cent were settled in System ' C . The number of families settled in the System 'B' and 'H' during the year was 1,468 and 1,151 respectively. There were no settlements in the system 'L' during 1991.

OTHER IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT

Work on existing major and minor irrigation projects continued in 1991 as in the previous year. Other irrigation development work consisted of rehabilitation, maintenance and management of existing major irrigation schemes, restoration and renovation of minor irrigation schemes including small tanks and flood protection. Greater emphasis was given to active farmer participation through the implementation of the Integrated Management System (INMAS) in all areas other than those covered by the Mahaweli Programme.

Work on all major irrigation activities, viz. Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project (KOISP) - Phase I, KOISP - Phase U, Nilwala Ganga Flood Protection Scheme, Village Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (VTRP), the Minipe - Nagadeepa Irrigation Reha­bilitation Project and North Western Province Special Irrigation Project continued in 1991. The total expenditure during 1991 on the above projects was Rs. 382 million in comparison to Rs. 291 million incurred in 1990. During the year, the activities on the development of lands and water resources for irrigated agriculture and water management in the major projects carried out by the Irrigation Department recorded a considerable increase.

Under the KOISP - Phase I, the work programmed for 1991 was to complete the Stage I of the domestic water supply scheme, of which 58 per cent of the work was completed as against 77 per cent targeted for the year. The total expenditure on this project was Rs. 116 million utilizing 97 per cent of the allocation for 1991. Under the Phase U of the KOISP, nearly 120 hectares of new irrigable lands were developed during 1991 at a cost of Rs. 85 million.

76

Stage II of the Nilwala Ganga Flood Protection Scheme envisaged the completion of SO per cent of the balance work of the project in 1991. However, only 30 per cent of the work programmed for 1991 was completed at a total cost of Rs. 9.6 million.

The construction work on the Village Irrigation Rehabilitation Projects (VTJRP) was carried out in 10 districts, completing 44 minor irrigation projects with an expenditure of Rs. 40 million in 1991. The total cost incurred in respect of Minipe and Nagadeepa Irrigation Rehabilitation Project during 1991 amounted to Rs. 16 million.

As in the previous year, the Irrigation Department continued to implement the con­struction of the irrigation component of the Integrated Rural Development Projects (IRDP) under the Ministry of Policy Planning and Plan Implementation in the districts of Hambantota, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla. The construction of minor irrigation works in the districts funded by the Decentralized Budget (DCB) was also carried out in 1991.

The North Western Province Special Irrigation Project which was inaugurated in 1990, progressed satisfactorily during 1991. Out of 10 schemes covered by the project in 1991, 3 schemes were completed. These will provide irrigation water to 1,240 hectares of new lands and 1,177 hectares of existing lands.

Work relating to the Integrated Management of Irrigation Systems (INMAS) contin­ued during 1991 as well. Under the above programme the number of farmer organisa­tions formed at the Distributory (D) - channel level and field channel level was 16 and 75, respectively.

INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

The Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) continued to improve the rural areas and the standard of living of rural people by decentralizing development activities with effective co-ordination at the central level.

As in the previous year, 12 districts were covered under the IRDP in 1991. Puttalam district IRDP programme which commenced in 1981 with World Bank assistance was terminated in 1991. A new IRDP for the Southern Province with ADB funds com­menced in 1991. This project covers activities mainly in the Galle district and village development activities in the other two districts in the Southern Province. The project preparation work of the Anuradhapura IRDP with the Swedish International Develop­ment Association (SIDA) assistance was undertaken during the year.

The total expenditure of the IRDP during 1991 amounted to Rs. 820 million when compared with Rs. 694 million in 1990. Cumulative expenditure on all the current projects along with expenditure incurred during 1990 and 1991 is given in Table 1.32.
