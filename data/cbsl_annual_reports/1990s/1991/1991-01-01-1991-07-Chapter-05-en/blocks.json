Although, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was able to meet this increased demand through hydro power, the thermal power generation also rose during the year due to lower levels of water in some of the reservoirs. Meanwhile, domestic consumption of diesel and kerosene contin\u00adued to expand due to the relative price advantage of these products. Moreover, the demand for heavy diesel was further augmented in 1991 due to a substantial increase in the use of heavy diesel by the CEB for operating thermal plants. However, the demand for super petrol declined by 11 per cent in 1991 owing to high prices prevailing during the year.",

However, total hydro electricity generation at 3,116 million kWh in 1991 recorded a marginal decline of 1 per cent due to lower levels of water in the reservoirs. Conse\u00adquently, the thermal power generation rose substantially to 260 million kWh during 1991 from a negligible level of 5 million kWh during the previous year, adding with notable balance of payments implications. Meanwhile, the losses involved in the process of power generation and transmission declined to 567 million kWh or about 17 per cent of total generation as compared with 589 million kWh or about 19 per cent in 1990.",

Moreover, the volume of crude oil imports also declined to 1,626 thousand metric tons in 1991 from 1,779 thousand metric tons in 1990 largely due to the closure of the oil refinery for maintenance during February, 1991. Consequently, the volume of imports of refined products rose from 124,986 metric tons in 1990 to 215,753 metric tons in 1991. Meanwhile, the volume of petroleum products exports at 523,211 metric tons in 1991 recorded a decline of 16 per cent. This, together with lower petroleum prices in 1991, contributed to a reduction in the export earnings from petroleum products from SDR 73 million (Rs. 3,974 million) in 1990 to SDR 58 million (Rs. 3,289 million) in 1991.",

The operated kilometres of the Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) which increased sharply by 28 per cent in the previous year rose by a further 4 per cent in 1991 due to an expansion in train services. The passenger transport service also continued to expand with the importation of more than 3,000 buses during 1991. This expansion was facilitated by the credit facilities provided by the National Development Bank (NDB) and tax concessions of\u00adfered by the Government. Meanwhile, with a view to improving the omnibus passenger transport the government established the National Transport Commission in September, 1991. Furthermore, the disparity in bus fares was corrected by bringing the private bus fares in line with those of the Sri Lanka Transport Board.",

Although, the passenger kilometerage at 2,698 million recorded a decline of 3 per cent over the previous year, the freight services indicated by cargo ton kilometerage, at 170 million recorded an increase of 4 per cent. Continued civil disturbances in the northern and eastern provinces had its impact over the performance of rail services in these regions. During 1991, the railway service on the Thalaimannar line was suspended and the services on the Northern and Batticaloa lines were curtailed. However, the overall adverse impact of the reduced scale of operations of the SLR in these regions was mitigated by an expansion in train services in the rest of the country. Five new trains were introduced on the Colombo - Puttalam line from June, 1991 while a new train service was also launched between Colombo Fort and Ragama. The train service between Colombo and Badulla was also extended to facilitate weekend travellers. Moreover, with a view to providing an improved commuter service in subur\u00adban areas, 20 new diesel hydraulic trains were commissioned during 1991. Reflecting these improvements, the total revenue of the SLR rose by 13 per cent to Rs. 656 million.",
