BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

OVERALL TRENDS

Sri Lanka's balance of payments experienced mixed fortunes in 1991, in response to various policy changes and certain adverse developments, both internal and external. The trade deficit increased from SDR 518 million (Rs.28,145 million) in 1990 to SDR 725 million (Rs 41,184 million) in 1991. The deficit in the services account increased by 8 per cent to SDR 78 million (Rs.4,448 million), in comparison to a deficit of SDR 72 million (Rs.3,904 million) in 1990. Meanwhile, gross receipts from private transfers increased from SDR 296 million (Rs. 16,054 million) in 1990 to SDR 320 million (Rs. 18,119 million ) in 1991. Official transfers, also increased to SDR 143 million (Rs.8,170 million) in 1991, as against SDR 130 million (Rs.7,142 million) in 1990. Mainly due to the considerable deterioration in the merchandise account, the current account deficit increased from SDR 192 million (Rs. 10,390 million) in 1990 to SDR 372 million (Rs. 21,127 million) in 1991. As a ratio of GDP, the current account deficit increased from 3.2 per cent to 5.6 per cent between the two years.

In contrast, the capital account reflected some favourable trends in 1991. There were substantial inflows of private foreign capital, particularly foreign direct investment and portfolio investments, while disbursements of foreign loans to the government also in­creased. Accordingly, net non-monetary capital inflows increased by 38 per cent to SDR 475 million in 1991. These inflows were more than sufficient to finance the increased deficit in the current account. The net result was a surplus of SDR 150 million in the overall balance, following the surplus of SDR 133 million in the previous year. Conse­quently, the country's total gross external assets increased to SDR 809 million at the end of 1991 from SDR 602 million at the end of 1990. This level of gross reserves was sufficient to finance 4.2 months of imports projected for 1992.

The above developments in the balance of payments reflected the combined effect of several policy changes and certain adverse developments. On the policy front, with a view to further liberalising the trade and payments system, several existing exchange control regulations and restrictions on trade and services were relaxed during the course of the year. In addition, there was a concerted effort to increase foreign capital inflows, and towards this end, a newly designed incentive package consisting of simplified and unified procedures for investment approval, tax holidays, concessionary duty rates, ex­emption from existing exchange controls, etc. was extended to foreign investors. Mean­while, the tea market faced a decline in prices during the year, while the production of rubber and coconut decreased. Furthermore, in addition to the large volatility of cross rates among key currencies, the Indian Rupee was devalued substantially in mid-1991. In this climate, the merchandise account deteriorated, and was mainly the outcome of the loss of export earnings from tea owing to depressed prices and a surge of imports in the wake of further liberalization of exchange controls and imports associated with increased foreign investment inflows.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS OUTTURN

Merchandise Account

One of the unfavourable features in the balance of payments out turn in 1991 was the significant deterioration in the merchandise account. Export earnings in 1991, at SDR 1,491 million (Rs.84,378 million), reflected a 2 per cent increase over earnings in 1990. This marginal increase was particularly disappointing, in the context of outlays on im­ports at SDR 2,216 million (Rs.125,562 million); reflecting a 12 per cent increase over the comparable figure for 1990. The decline in tea prices coupled with reduced earnings from the other traditional agricultural exports were the major factors that adversely af­fected exports. Meanwhile, considerable liberalisation of exchange and trade controls, in particular the exclusion of imports valued below US $ 1,000, from the Letters of Credit requirement, the extension of borrowing facilities from FCBUs to exporters to import their raw materials and the withdrawal of requirements to obtain prior Exchange Control approval to establish Letters of Credit for imports on deferred payment terms, all contrib­uted towards a large import flow. Moreover, the devaluation of the Indian Rupee in the middle of the year made the imports from that country relatively cheaper. The combina­tion of all these factors resulted in a substantial deterioration in the merchandise account, from SDR 518 million in 1990 to SDR 725 million in 1991.

Services Account

The services account recorded considerable increases in both receipts and payments in 1991. A major net inflow was reflected in the port, transportation and insurance category, predominantly due to the increase in earnings from passenger fares by Air Lanka and higher port receipts. While receipts in the travel account increased by 21 per cent due to increased tourist arrivals during the year, outflows on account of foreign travel also increased by 31 per cent. Accordingly, the net inflows in the travel account recorded an increase of 8 per cent. Both receipts and payments in the investment income category showed increases, but out-payments exceeded receipts. Increased earnings re­flected the improvement in the country's external assets position. While interest pay­ments on loans by the private sector had increased, interest payments on official loans also rose during the year. Meanwhile, earnings in the "other services" category reflected a substantial increase of 25 per cent, mainly due to higher receipts on account of miscel­laneous professional services. However, out-payments in this category rose sharply dur­ing the year due to the settlement of an arbitration award of SDR 36 million (US $ 50 Million) to US contractors of the Madura Oya Project of the Mahaweli Development Programme. When this unanticipated payment is excluded from the services account, it is seen that there was a considerable improvement in the services account in 1991.

Transfers Account

i There was an improvement in the transfers account in 1991 in comparison to 1990. Total net receipts on account of both private and official transfers increased to SDR 431 million in 1991 from SDR 398 million in 1990. Net private transfers increased by 7 per cent to SDR 288 million. Worker remittances continued to account for a major share of private transfers. The end of the Gulf war saw an outflow of workers migrating to the Middle East during the second half of 1991, resulting in an increase in remittances from

this source. It is also apparent that following the Gulf war and ensuing uncertainty, workers in the Middle East are now remitting their savings to Sri Lanka, rather than retaining them in banks in the Middle East. Meanwhile, official transfers at SDR 143 million, recorded a 10 per cent increase in 1991. Of the total official transfers received, SDR 11 million (US $ 15 million) was in the form of a grant from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) towards part-settlement of the arbitra­tion award to a US contractor referred to in the previous section.

Current Account

Despite the satisfactory performances in the services and transfers accounts, a sig­nificant deterioration in the trade account resulted in widening the current account deficit from SDR 192 million (Rs.10,390 million) in 1990 to SDR 372 million (Rs.21,127 million) in 1991. While the deficit in 1990 was the lowest recorded in the previous 5 years, the deficit in 1991 was the highest since 1985. As a ratio to GDP, the deficit increased from 3.2 per cent to 5.6 per cent between-1990 and 1991. This ratio excluding grants also increased by 2 percentage points, from 5.5 per cent in 1990 to 7.8 per cent in 1991. This significant increase in the current account deficit was the most negative feature of balance of payments developments in 1991.

Capital Account

In contrast to the developments in the current account, net non-monetary capital inflows in 1991 reflected a 38 per cent increase, from SDR 344 million in 1990 to SDR 475 million in 1991. An outstanding feature of this increase was a very substantial rise in direct investment to SDR 74 million, albeit from a low base of SDR 31 million in 1990. The increase was reflected in both foreign direct investment in GCEC enterprises and portfolio investment through the Colombo Stock Exchange. It reflects a quick response to a considerable number of incentives provided to encourage foreign investment to Sri Lanka and the government's on-going programme of divestiture of its ownership in business enterprises. As in 1990, there was a net outflow on account of private loan capital. However, both inflows and outflows had increased from the previous year. In­flows were mainly due to loans to GCEC enterprises and Air Lanka, while outflows included progress payments by Air Lanka towards its aircraft reflecting programme. The net utilisation of short term credits by the private sector decreased from SDR 48 million to SDR 34 million between 1990 and 1991. Again, while inflows had increased, a large net repayment by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation resulted in an overall decrease in net inflows.

Inflows of net non-monetary capital to the government increased from SDR 298 million in 1990 to SDR 390 million in 1991. While amortization payments remained at around the same level in both years, inflows of long-term capital increased by 18 per cent to SDR 461 million in 1991. The major inflows were in the form of concessional assist­ance from Japan (SDR 154 million), the International Development Association (IDA) (SDR 138 million) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (SDR 105 million), a major share of which was balance of payments support loans towards economic restructuring. In addition, a US government guaranteed short term interim loan of SDR 23 million (US $ 30 million) was obtained by the government towards part-settlement of the arbitration award of US $ 50 million.

EXTERNAL ASSETS

Sri Lanka's gross external assets which stood at SDR 809 million at the end of 1991, recorded a 34 per cent increase over the level of SDR 602 million at the end of the previous year. The increase was almost entirely reflected in the foreign assets held by the Central Bank, which rose from SDR 286 million at end-1990 to SDR 476 million at end-1991. Assets held by the government also expanded by SDR 7 million to SDR 27 million, thus raising gross official reserves, comprising foreign assets of the Central Bank and government, from SDR 306 million at end-1990 to SDR 503 million at the end of 1991. Meanwhile, foreign assets of the commercial banks reflected an increase of SDR 10 million between the two years, from SDR 296 million at end-1990 to SDR 306 million at end-1991. Gross external assets at the end of 1991 were sufficient to finance 4.2 months of imports projected for 1992.

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS

With the exception of the US dollar, the value of the Sri Lanka rupee fluctuated against all other major currencies during 1991. The rupee had depreciated throughout the year against the intervention currency, the US dollar, reflecting a total depreciation of 5.5 per cent from end-1990 to end-1991. Meanwhile, movements against the Pound Sterling, Deutsche Mark, Japanese Yen and French Franc, during the year, first reflected a depre­ciation upto February, followed by an appreciation along with the US dollar in the aftermath of the Gulf war until July, followed by a continuous depreciation during the latter part of the year. The overall impact of these movements was the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee from end-1990 to end-1991 against the Japanese Yen by 13.2 per cent, Deutsche Mark by 6.7 per cent, French Franc by 5.9 per cent and the Pound Sterling by 5.0 per cent. Accordingly, the rupee depreciated against the SDR by 5.9 per cent from end-1990 to end-1991. Meanwhile, with the devaluation of the Indian Rupee in 1991, the Sri Lanka rupee reflected an appreciation of 36.6 per cent against the Indian currency during the period under review.

Reflecting the combined effect of these exchange rate movements, Sri Lanka's Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER), defined as the trade-weighted nominal ex­change rate with respect to major trading partners, depreciated by 0.01 per cent on a point-to-point basis in 1991. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), which is the nominal exchange rate adjusted for inflation differentials between Sri Lanka and her major trading partners, appreciated by 4.4 per cent on the same basis during the year. The annual average NEER depreciated by 1.1 per cent, while the annual average REER appreciated by 5.3 per cent in 1991.

EXTERNAL DEBT

Sri Lanka's total outstanding external debt at the end of 1991 was estimated at SDR 4,598 million, showing an increase of SDR 476 million during the year. The bulk of this increase was reflected in the medium and long term debt of the government, which rose from SDR 3,190 million to SDR 3,601 million. Most of the increase was in the category of long-term concessional loans to the government, mainly from Japan, the IDA and the ADB, while other multilateral and bilateral external debt had not shown much change. Meanwhile, despite the release of the first tranche of SDR 56 million by the International

Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility arrangement, total outstanding debt to the IMF declined to SDR 280 million, as compared with SDR 288 million at the end of 1990, due to increased repayments on account of IMF loans. The government's short-term debt outstanding amounting to SDR 21 million solely re­flected a short-term loan obtained by the government for settlement of an arbitration award. Meanwhile, the outstanding level of other short-term debt increased from SDR 294 million at end-1990 to SDR 328 million in 1991. This was the combined effect of a net repayment of SDR 30 million by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, an increase in import credits of GCEC enterprises, and an increase in short term loans from FCBUs after the extension of FCBU borrowing facilities to exporters in August 1991.

DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS

Debt service payments, which include amortization of medium and long-term loans and interest payments on all foreign loans, increased by SDR 25 million, from SDR 329 million in 1990 to SDR 354 million in 1991. The increase was reflected in both amortiza­tion and interest payments. The entire rise in amortization payments was on account of repayments of IMF loans. Amortization payments on private sector loans decreased while repayment of government debt had essentially remained at the same level in 1991 as in the previous year. Interest payments to the IMF had decreased from SDR 21 million to SDR 15 million between the two years, while interest payments on other loans increased from SDR 126 million to SDR 141 million. Consequently, debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from the export of goods and services was 18.1 per cent in 1991, almost the same level as in 1990. The debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from the export of goods and services and private transfers was 15.5 per cent in 1991, which was again at around the same level as in 1990.
