    "text": "Sri Lanka's balance of payments experienced mixed fortunes in 1991, in response to various policy changes and certain adverse developments, both internal and external. The trade deficit increased from SDR 518 million (Rs.28,145 million) in 1990 to SDR 725 million (Rs 41,184 million) in 1991. The deficit in the services account increased by 8 per cent to SDR 78 million (Rs.4,448 million), in comparison to a deficit of SDR 72 million (Rs.3,904 million) in 1990. Meanwhile, gross receipts from private transfers increased from SDR 296 million (Rs. 16,054 million) in 1990 to SDR 320 million (Rs. 18,119 million ) in 1991. Official transfers, also increased to SDR 143 million (Rs.8,170 million) in 1991, as against SDR 130 million (Rs.7,142 million) in 1990. Mainly due to the considerable deterioration in the merchandise account, the current account deficit increased from SDR 192 million (Rs. 10,390 million) in 1990 to SDR 372 million (Rs. 21,127 million) in 1991. As a ratio of GDP, the current account deficit increased from 3.2 per cent to 5.6 per cent between the two years.",

    "text": "In contrast, the capital account reflected some favourable trends in 1991. There were substantial inflows of private foreign capital, particularly foreign direct investment and portfolio investments, while disbursements of foreign loans to the government also in\u00adcreased. Accordingly, net non-monetary capital inflows increased by 38 per cent to SDR 475 million in 1991. These inflows were more than sufficient to finance the increased deficit in the current account. The net result was a surplus of SDR 150 million in the overall balance, following the surplus of SDR 133 million in the previous year. Conse\u00adquently, the country's total gross external assets increased to SDR 809 million at the end of 1991 from SDR 602 million at the end of 1990. This level of gross reserves was sufficient to finance 4.2 months of imports projected for 1992.",

    "text": "The above developments in the balance of payments reflected the combined effect of several policy changes and certain adverse developments. On the policy front, with a view to further liberalising the trade and payments system, several existing exchange control regulations and restrictions on trade and services were relaxed during the course of the year. In addition, there was a concerted effort to increase foreign capital inflows, and towards this end, a newly designed incentive package consisting of simplified and unified procedures for investment approval, tax holidays, concessionary duty rates, ex\u00ademption from existing exchange controls, etc. was extended to foreign investors. Mean\u00adwhile, the tea market faced a decline in prices during the year, while the production of rubber and coconut decreased. Furthermore, in addition to the large volatility of cross rates among key currencies, the Indian Rupee was devalued substantially in mid-1991. In this climate, the merchandise account deteriorated, and was mainly the outcome of the loss of export earnings from tea owing to depressed prices and a surge of imports in the wake of further liberalization of exchange controls and imports associated with increased foreign investment inflows.",

Export earnings in 1991, at SDR 1,491 million (Rs.84,378 million), reflected a 2 per cent increase over earnings in 1990. This marginal increase was particularly disappointing, in the context of outlays on im\u00adports at SDR 2,216 million (Rs.125,562 million); reflecting a 12 per cent increase over the comparable figure for 1990. The decline in tea prices coupled with reduced earnings from the other traditional agricultural exports were the major factors that adversely af\u00adfected exports. Meanwhile, considerable liberalisation of exchange and trade controls, in particular the exclusion of imports valued below US $ 1,000, from the Letters of Credit requirement, the extension of borrowing facilities from FCBUs to exporters to import their raw materials and the withdrawal of requirements to obtain prior Exchange Control approval to establish Letters of Credit for imports on deferred payment terms, all contrib\u00aduted towards a large import flow. Moreover, the devaluation of the Indian Rupee in the middle of the year made the imports from that country relatively cheaper. The combina\u00adtion of all these factors resulted in a substantial deterioration in the merchandise account, from SDR 518 million in 1990 to SDR 725 million in 1991.",

    "text": "The services account recorded considerable increases in both receipts and payments in 1991. A major net inflow was reflected in the port, transportation and insurance category, predominantly due to the increase in earnings from passenger fares by Air Lanka and higher port receipts. While receipts in the travel account increased by 21 per cent due to increased tourist arrivals during the year, outflows on account of foreign travel also increased by 31 per cent. Accordingly, the net inflows in the travel account recorded an increase of 8 per cent. Both receipts and payments in the investment income category showed increases, but out-payments exceeded receipts. Increased earnings re\u00adflected the improvement in the country's external assets position. While interest pay\u00adments on loans by the private sector had increased, interest payments on official loans also rose during the year. Meanwhile, earnings in the \"other services\" category reflected a substantial increase of 25 per cent, mainly due to higher receipts on account of miscel\u00adlaneous professional services. However, out-payments in this category rose sharply dur\u00ading the year due to the settlement of an arbitration award of SDR 36 million (US $ 50 Million) to US contractors of the Madura Oya Project of the Mahaweli Development Programme. When this unanticipated payment is excluded from the services account, it is seen that there was a considerable improvement in the services account in 1991.",

While the deficit in 1990 was the lowest recorded in the previous 5 years, the deficit in 1991 was the highest since 1985.

An outstanding feature of this increase was a very substantial rise in direct investment to SDR 74 million, albeit from a low base of SDR 31 million in 1990. The increase was reflected in both foreign direct investment in GCEC enterprises and portfolio investment through the Colombo Stock Exchange. It reflects a quick response to a considerable number of incentives provided to encourage foreign investment to Sri Lanka and the government's on-going programme of divestiture of its ownership in business enterprises. As in 1990, there was a net outflow on account of private loan capital. However, both inflows and outflows had increased from the previous year. In\u00adflows were mainly due to loans to GCEC enterprises and Air Lanka, while outflows included progress payments by Air Lanka towards its aircraft reflecting programme. The net utilisation of short term credits by the private sector decreased from SDR 48 million to SDR 34 million between 1990 and 1991. Again, while inflows had increased, a large net repayment by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation resulted in an overall decrease in net inflows.",

The government's short-term debt outstanding amounting to SDR 21 million solely re\u00adflected a short-term loan obtained by the government for settlement of an arbitration award. Meanwhile, the outstanding level of other short-term debt increased from SDR 294 million at end-1990 to SDR 328 million in 1991. This was the combined effect of a net repayment of SDR 30 million by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, an increase in import credits of GCEC enterprises, and an increase in short term loans from FCBUs after the extension of FCBU borrowing facilities to exporters in August 1991.",

    "text": "Debt service payments, which include amortization of medium and long-term loans and interest payments on all foreign loans, increased by SDR 25 million, from SDR 329 million in 1990 to SDR 354 million in 1991. The increase was reflected in both amortiza\u00adtion and interest payments. The entire rise in amortization payments was on account of repayments of IMF loans. Amortization payments on private sector loans decreased while repayment of government debt had essentially remained at the same level in 1991 as in the previous year. Interest payments to the IMF had decreased from SDR 21 million to SDR 15 million between the two years, while interest payments on other loans increased from SDR 126 million to SDR 141 million. Consequently, debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from the export of goods and services was 18.1 per cent in 1991, almost the same level as in 1990. The debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from the export of goods and services and private transfers was 15.5 per cent in 1991, which was again at around the same level as in 1990.",
