(a) the demand and supply conditions for the foreign currencies in the local foreign exchange market;

(b) the overall liquidity position in the banking system and the behaviour of the call money market;

(c) movement of foreign cross exchange rates in major financial centres; and

(d) overall position of the country's international reserves.

These changes were made in order to develop further the local foreign exchange market.

The Bank continued to operate in the U.S. Dollar Forward Purchases Market on a regular basis with commercial banks. The period of such cover was up to six months.

Sale of Gold

In the year under review, the Central Bank opened its third gold sales outlet at the Head Office. This was in addition to the two gold sales outlets at the Colombo Interna­tional Aiport, Katunayake. The Gold Sales outlet opened in March, 1991, at the Head Office premises, sold gold only for designated foreign currencies till August, 1991, when it commenced such sales for Sri Lanka Rupees and withdrew the sale of gold for foreign currencies. Gold could now be purchased at a concessionary rate of duty without restric­tions from this outlet.

Asian Clearing Union

The total value of the transactions routed through the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) Facility in 1991, amounted to Rs. 23,906 million as compared with Rs. 11,442 million during the previous year. The rupee value of net settlements made in foreign currency in 1991, amounted to Rs. 8,756 million as compared with Rs. 4,401 million in 1990. The Swap facility introduced in 1989 continued to be operative during the year and Sri Lanka contributed Rs. 61 million in 1991 towards this facility.

ACU member countries have given their consent to the proposal made by the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) for the utilisation of the ACU mechanism for settlement of accounts under the SAARC Travel Voucher Scheme.

Bank Rate

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank Rate) on short-term advances to commer­cial banks secured by the pledge of Government guaranteed securities and against the pledge of usance promissory notes relating to commercial and production loans was increased from IS per centum per annum to 17 per centum per annum as from January 04,1991.

V

Short Term Credit

The Central Bank continued to provide facilities to commercial banks under the Export Credit Refinance Scheme (ECRS). During the year, the rates of interest under the scheme were revised upwards on three occasions as follows :

The Bank continued to refund 4 percentage points of the interest charged under the ECRS so that the lending banks could pass on the benefit to the customers on export transactions, provided the export proceeds are received in Sri Lanka within the time limits stipulated by the Controller of Exchange.

Several changes were introduced with respect to the coverage and extent of refinance provided under the above two categories. Refinance facilities provided under Category I were withdrawn for tea in bulk and ready made garments with effect from March 31, and April 02, 1991, respectively. The extent of refinance for remaining items in this category was reduced from 100 per cent to 50 per cent of the relevant packing credit granted by commercial banks with effect from April 02,1991.

As from September 04, 1991, extent of refinance available under Category II was restricted to 75 per cent of the loan granted by the commercial bank to the exporter, but with effect from October 17, 1991, it was revised to 60 per cent of the f.o.b. value of the firm export order or Letter of Credit but not more than the amount of loan granted by the commercial bank. With the objective of rationalising the provision of refinance facilities for exports under Category II, the scheme was further reviewed and with effect from September 04, 1991, it was restricted to pioneering and high value added products and a maximum ceiling of Rs. 10 million was imposed on each individual exporter in respect of each item of export. For specified products which were considered high value added but traditional or well established, refinance facilities were made available under Category I subject to the limits allocated to individual banks.

With effect from April 02, 1991, a new scheme of refinance was introduced for the benefit of export oriented Geuda Industrialists for the heat treatment of geuda stones. Under this scheme, a limit of Rs. 25 million was allocated to each selected bank. The rate of interest was fixed at 13 per cent per annum with an on lending margin of 4 per cent per annum.

VI

The rate of interest on Central Bank advances against the pledge of usance promis­sory notes of co-operative societies or of individuals relating to the production of paddy, vegetables and other specified crops and for the purchase and storage of commodities under the Guaranteed Price Scheme (GPS) and the Floor Price Scheme was increased during the year as follows:

Medium and Long Term Credit

The Medium and Long Term Credit Fund (MLCF) which stood at Rs. 3,250 million as at end of 1990 was raised to Rs. 4,000 million by the end of 1991.

The interest rates on all categories under the MLCF were raised by 2 percentage points on January 04, 1991, and by another 2 percentage points on August 15, 1991. During the year, margins permitted to participating credit institutions remained un­changed at 7 per cent per annum in respect of Category I and 4 per cent per annum for the other three categories. The revised interest rates are as follows:

The grant of refinance under the scheme was suspended with effect from December 23,1991.

Accommodation to Finance Companies

The Central Bank continued to grant financial accommodation to commercial banks in terms of Section 20 (4) (a) and 21 (1) of the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988 in respect of their lending operations with non-bank financial institutions facing temporary liquidity problems and/or whose administration and management have been taken over by the Monetary Board. The total amount disbursed on this account upto end 1991, amounted to Rs. 900 million.

Reserve Requirements

The Statutory Reserve Ratio on demand, time and savings deposits liabilities of commercial banks was fixed at 13 per cent with effect from January 11,1991. As on that date the facility granted to commercial banks to hold Treasury bills as part of their required reserves was withdrawn.

Secondary Market Operations in Treasury Bills

The sales turnover 6f Treasury Bills in the Secondary market increased from Rs. 67,907 million in 1990 to Rs. 78,254 million in 1991. The purchase turnover also in­creased from Rs. 21,355 million to Rs. 37,486 million during the year. The net sales turnover to the non-banking sector increased from Rs. 8,132 million in 1990 to Rs. 9,658 million in 1991.

The discount rates applicable to Secondary Market Operations in Treasury Bills varied between 12 per cent per annum and 15.25 per cent per annum during the year.

Subsidy and Ex-gratia Payment to Indian Repatriates

The Bank continued to operate, on behalf of the Government, the schemes relating to the repatriation of estate workers of Indian origin covered under the Indo-Ceylon Agree­ment of 1964.

Import Duty Rebate to Exporters

The Bank continued to reimburse on behalf c. the Government, claims made by commercial banks in respect of import duty rebates paid to exporters. A total sum of Rs. 556.5 million was reimbursed during 1991.

Compulsory Savings Fund

The Central Bank continued to be the custodian of the monies collected in terms of the Compulsory Savings Act No. 6 of 1971 and the ceiling on Income and Compulsory Savings Law No. 15 of 1972 and administered the Compulsory Savings Fund on behalf of the Government. During the year, the Bank paid out to contributors Rs. 0.1 million (inclusive of interest) on 16 applications received.

vm

Government Accounts

As Banker to the Government, the Central Bank continued to maintain accounts of Government Departments, Government Agencies and Institutions and certain statutory boards. The number of operational accounts at the end of December, 1991 was 187.

CURRENCY ISSUE

During 1991, the Bank continued to perform the function of issuing legal tender currency in Sri Lanka for use in domestic transactions. Several changes were made to the currency management and operations by the Bank during the year.

In order to upgrade the quality of currency notes in circulation in the country, the Bank launched a clean currency note operation with the help of commercial banks. Over the years, the Bank had found that the quality of the currency notes in circulation was far below the normally accepted standards. Hence, it was necessary to raise the shroffing standards so as to ensure the issue of better quality currency notes to the public. The Bank with the co-operation of commercial banks, commenced issuing new currency notes from its Head Office and the Regional Offices at Matara and Anuradhapura. In the districts of Matara, Matale and Kandy, two clean currency note operation schemes were launched by the Bank by issuing new currency notes to commercial banks in the respec­tive districts. A public awareness campaign was also launched in these Districts to coin­cide with the event.

During 1991, the Bank took action to change the design of the currency notes in circulation in the country. The new currency notes were designed to depict historical and archaeological themes so as to highlight the country's rich heritage. In keeping with the international standards and to ensure convenience to the using public and longer durabil­ity of currency notes, the new design currency notes were made slightly smaller than the existing currency notes of the respective denominations. The currency notes in the de­nominations of Rs. 1,000, Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 were issued for circulation in 1991, while the other denominations were scheduled to be issued in early 1992.

During 1991, the Bank made arrangements to issue three commemorative coins, two coins to mark the Fifth South Asian Federation Games held in Colombo in December 1991 and the other to commemorate the third anniversary of the induction of His Excel­lency the President, Ranasinghe Premadasa. The SAF Games commemorative coins were in the denominations of Rs. 500 and Rs. 100. The Rs. 500 coin was struck in 12 carat gold, while Rs. 100 coin was in silver. The Rs. 500 gold coin was round in shape and designed similar to the ancient Sri Lankan coin "Kalanda" or "Aka". The Rs. 100 silver coin was square in shape with a carved edge and was similar to the ancient silver coin "Masuran" or "Purana" that was in use in the 5th century B.C.

The Bank made arrangements to commemorate the third anniversary of the induction of His Excellency the President, Ranasinghe Premadasa by issuing a Rs. 1/- commemora­tive coin struck in silver. The coin depicted the portrait of His Excellency on one side and the Presidential flag on the obverse. Arrangements were also made by the Bank to issue a

IX

general circulation coin of the same design struck in cupro-nickel for use by the general public. The coins were scheduled to be issued in early January, 1992.

With the increase in the volume of currency issued by the Bank, it was necessary for the Bank to expedite the processing of currency notes so as to provide a more efficient service to the public. Currency processing involving the following distinctive operations had so far been handled by the Bank entirely manually:

1. Counting of currency notes deposited in the Bank by commercial banks and government departments;

2. Verification of these notes to detect counterfeit currency notes;

3. Sorting of currency notes into serviceable and unserviceable categories so that serviceable notes could be reissued for a further cycle;

4. Bundling and strapping of serviceable notes for reissue;

5. Destruction of unserviceable currency notes under security conditions.

The Bank had long felt that manual handling of these operations resulted in long delays, accumulation of currency notes in the Bank and a tremendous increase in the cost of processing of currency notes. This interfered with the Bank's prime responsibility of supplying clean and serviceable currency notes to the economy in adequate numbers. In view of these considerations, the Bank decided to automate its currency processing ac­tivities so as to gain capability of providing a better service to the public. Accordingly, arrangements were made by the Bank to install two Currency Verification, Counting and Sorting Systems known as "CVCS Systems" in the Bank. These systems were capable of handling all the above currency processing operations at a high speed with a few opera­tors. These machines are scheduled to be commissioned in the Bank in early 1992.

BANKING DEVELOPMENT

Institutional Network

The year 1991 witnessed a considerable expansion in the banking network in the country. Emphasis on the promotion of rural banking continued during 1991. Accordingly .three new Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) were established during the year raising the total number of RRDBs operating in the country to 15. The number of local commercial banks remained unchanged at 6 while the number of foreign banks dropped to 17 in 1991 with the merger of the Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. (ABN) and the Amsterdam-Rotterdam N.V. (Amro Bank) in September 1991. Accord­ingly, the total number of commercial banks operating in the country reduced to 23 in 1991. A noteworthy feature observed during the year was the manner in which Sri Lanka managed to handle the banking crisis experienced world-wide with the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International Ltd. (BCCI) which shook the international banking industry. The Central Bank took immediate steps to take over the control of the

X

BCCI branches operating in Sri Lanka and subsequently domestic banking business of the BCCI was vested in the Seylan Bank Ltd.

A substantial expansion in the bank branch network was observed during the year. Consequent to these changes the total number of RRDB branches increased from 101 to 124 at the end of the year. Increasing the total number of commercial bank branches to 763 the number of domestic bank branches increased to 738 while the number of foreign bank branches rose to 25. However, branch expansion of the two state banks recorded a slowing down during the year. The People's Bank opened two new branches raising its number of branches to 308 while Bank of Ceylon increased its branch network including extension offices and pay offices from 323 to 328 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, private domestic banks continued to expand their business to outstations. Consequently, Hatton National Bank Ltd., Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. and the Seylan Bank Ltd. opened 3, 2 and 9 new branches respectively increasing the number of domestic private bank branches to 102. The National Savings Bank expanded its branch net-work to 81, and the State Mortgage and Investment Bank opened its second branch during 1991. The Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) upgraded its representative office to the status of a branch during the year.

Mobile Banking Services

The RRDBs continued their mobile banking services in order to provide banking facilities to under-banked and unbanked areas in their respective areas of operation. The Seylan Bank also conducted Mobile Banking Centres at Alubomulla and Sarikkamulla in the Kalutara district; at Yakkala in the Gampaha district; and at Attidiya, Boralesgamuwa, Kalubowila and Kottawa in the Colombo district.

Installation of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)

The People's Bank, Bank of Ceylon and the Hatton National Bank Ltd. also intro­duced ATMs, in 1991, increasing the number of banks operating ATMs in the country to 7. The People's Bank named its ATM 'PET' (People's Electronic Teller) and installed them at five of its branches while the bank of Ceylon installed ATMs with the name 'Ceybank Cash Points' at six branches. The Bank of Ceylon also installed two off-site ATMs at the premises of the Merchant Bank of Sri lanka Ltd. Colombo 3 and at the Ceylon Tobacco Company Ltd. in Colombo 13. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd. installed two off-site ATMs at the Liberty Plaza building, Colombo 3.

BANK SUPERVISION

The Bank Supervision Department undertook the examination of 10 commercial banks and 3 Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) in 1991 and concluded 7 of these examinations during the year. In addition, the Department also finalised the exami­nation of 5 commercial banks which had been commenced in 1990. The scope of supervi­sion was widened in the year under review, when for the first time, the Department conducted examinations of two Merchant Banks.

XI

The Department continued to monitor the financial condition of commercial banks and RRDBs on the basis of monthly statement of Assets and Liabilities furnished by them. Similarly, monitoring of the transactions of Foreign Currency Units (FCBUs) es­tablished by commercial banks under the Foreign Currency Banking Scheme (FCBS) too was carried out by the Department on a monthly basis while the profitability of commer­cial banks including FCBUs was analysed on the basis of annual returns.

As a part of supervision activities, the Department also monitored the compliance of commercial banks with credit ceilings imposed in June, 1989 on non-priority sectors and cash margin requirements on Letters of Credit for specified non-essential imports. The Department was responsible for ensuring the adherence of commercial banks to the directives and guidelines issued under the Banking Act. These included the stipulation of minimum capital funds and liquidity ratios, limits on lendings to a single borrower, directors and directors' interests and restrictions on shareholdings. In the case of violation of such directives and regulations, action was initiated by the Department against offend­ers.

During the year 1991, the continuous supervision of commercial banks was further strengthened by examining the periodical returns to liquidity under the directives issued in terms of the Banking Act and other statements furnished periodically. With the imple­mentation of Part V of the Banking Act, "the Accounts Formats for Banks" which was introduced in September, 1990 came into operation in 1991 when all commercial banks presented their accounts for 1990 under an uniform system.

In order to establish a common standard in income recognition and loan loss provisioning the Department issued a set of guidelines in February, 1991. These guide­lines set out the minimum requirements that commercial banks should observe in respect of interest in suspense, classification of advances as non-performing and provision for bad and doubtful advances. All commercial banks were required to set up interest in suspense where necessary by 1st April, 1991 and to comply with the other requirements by 1st April, 1992.

During 1991 too the Department continued to administer the operation of the Deposit Insurance Scheme which came into operation in 1987. Under this Scheme which extends its cover to commercial banks, RRDBs and Co-operative Rural Banks on an optional basis, a total number of 13 institutions comprising 2 commercial banks, 3 RRDBs and 8 CRRBs had been registered at the end of 1991. The premium payable under the Deposit Insurance Scheme was revised and the new rate applicable was to be 3.75 cents for every Rs. 100 per quarter (i.e. 15 cents for every Rs. 100 per annum) effective 1st January, 1992.

During the second half of the year under review, the Department was directly in­volved in handling several issues connected with the affairs of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Limited (BCCI). Following the global suspension of the operations of BCCI the Monetary Board in terms of Section 30 (1) of the Monetary Law Act suspended the operations of the Sri Lanka branches of the BCCI from 7th July, 1991. Under a management agreement, entered into with Seylan Bank Limited the Mon­etary Board delegated the management of the BCCI branches to Seylan Bank Ltd. and banking operations were resumed on 29th July, 1991. In December, 1991 the Monetary

xn

Board approved the vesting of the Domestic Banking business of the BCCI in the Seylan Bank Limited under the Emergency (Banking Special Provisions) Regulations No. 2 of 1991, which became effective on 1st January, 1992. As a measure of affording relief to the NRFC and RNNFC account holders of the former BCCI, the Central Bank initiated a Relief Scheme for the payment of these holders. Under this relief scheme, approximately 85 per cent of the deposit holders would be able to receive the full amount of their deposit in Rupees.

NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

Under the provisions of the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988, 24 companies were registered and granted licences to conduct finance business during 1991. Of these, 20 companies were registered in December, 1990 and 4 during the first few months of 1991. As at end of 1991 total deposit liabilities of these companies amounted to Rs. 5,647.9 million, an increase of Rs. 29.7 million or 0.5 per cent over the deposit liabilities as at 31.12.1990. This increase in deposits has to be viewed in the context of several unregistered finance companies divesting their finance business and commencing to settle deposits on a Directive issued by the Monetary Board on 17th December, 1990.

The supervisory and regulatory role of the Central Bank over finance companies was further strengthened through amendments which were enacted to Sections 5, 9, 12, 25, 33, 38 and 46 of the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988 by the enactment of the Finance Companies (Amendment) Act No. 23 of 1991. The amendments to Sections 12, 25 and 46 were earlier promulgated by the President under Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance (Chapter 40) as Emergency (Finance Companies) Regulations No. 2 of 1990, No. 1 of 1990 and No. 1 of 1991, respectively. As a preliminary to the licensing of finance companies for the year 1992, comprehensive on-site examinations were con­ducted in respect of the companies which had made applications for licences. Two regis­tered finance companies that pleaded having liquidity problems were subject to investiga­tive audits by independent Auditors.

Registration of Companies

The finance companies which were not registered by 18th December, 1990, had been directed to divest their finance business and settle their liabilities to depositors in terms of Direction No. 2 of 1990 issued by the Monetary Board on 17th December, 1990. In terms of this Direction, the financial institutions to which the Direction was applicable had to settle their deposit liabilities in the following manner -

(i) Those institutions which had deposit liabilities exceeding Rs. 40 million as at 19th December, 1990, shall pay up their deposit liabilities by not less than 5 per cent per month, and

(ii) Those institutions which had deposit liabilities not exceeding Rs. 40 million as at 19th December, 1990 shall pay up their deposit liabilities by not less than 8.5 per cent per month.

Of this amount Rs. 214.9 million was disbursed during 1991.

XVI

Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund

The Central Bank adopted a more selective and restrictive policy during the year 1991 in providing refinance on account of monetary stabilization policies pursued by the Bank. Accordingly, the approvals of refinance under Category U, Dl and IV of the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund registered a sharp decline from Rs. 908 million in 1990 to Rs. 237 million in 1991, a decline of 74 per cent The decline in refinance approvals was in respect of Category in and IV while refinance approvals under Cat­egory U increased from Rs. 23 million in 1990 to Rs. 73 million in 1991 (Table 2.8).

mately. Total interest income received during the year from these investments amounted to Rs. 27 million.

Entrepreneur Development Programme

Three entrepreneur development programmes were conducted during the year. The first programme aimed at creating awareness in self-employment opportunities amongst school leavers and Janasaviya recipients was held in the Polonnaruwa District which was attended by 102 participants. The second programme devoted to skill development of existing 130 entrepreneurs selected from the Moneragala District was held in Moneragala. The 3rd programme aimed at upgrading management skills and technology of 35 industrialists engaged in light engineering was organised in the Hambantota Dis­trict. All these programmes were conducted with the assistance of the Industrial Develop­ment Board of Sri Lanka and the Regional Rural Development Banks of Polonnaruwa, Moneragala and Hambantota.

RURAL CREDIT

In 1991 the Central Bank continued its role as a credit executing agency for the implementation of the following credit schemes funded by foreign agencies.

1. International Fund for Agricultural Development (EFAD) funded Badulla District Integrated Rural Development Project.

2. IFAD funded Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development Project.

3. Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project (Phase U).

4. ADB funded Small Holder Tea Development Project.

5. ADB funded Mid-Country Perennial Crop Development Project.

6. ADB funded Agriculture Rehabilitation Project.

During 1991 loans amounting to Rs. 26.4 million have been granted under the Integrated Rural Development Projects in the districts of Badulla and Kegalle.

A review of the performance of the branches of the Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) under Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project - Phase U located in the project area was conducted in July 1991 to assess the performance of PCIs in meeting the credit requirements of the new settlers.

During 1991 the Bank continued to play its role as the executing agency for the credit component of the Small Holder Tea Development Project by providing refinance out of loan funds obtained from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for field develop­ment, nursery development and factory rehabilitation purposes through the Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, Commercial Bank Ltd., Hatton National Bank Ltd., Sampath Bank Ltd., Development Finance Corporation and the Regional Rural Development Banks of Kandy, Kegalle and Kalutara districts. As at the end of 1991, refinance amount­ing to Rs. 18.9 million had been provided under this scheme.

XXIII

The Perennial Crop Development Project Credit Scheme is designed to provide credit facilities to farmers with the funds obtained from the ADB for the purpose of increasing the production and improving the commercialization of perennial crops par­ticularly the minor export crops and food crops in the districts of Badulla, Kandy, Matale and Moneragala. The Participating Credit Institutions of the credit scheme are the Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, Hatton National Bank Ltd., Commercial Bank Ltd., and RRDBs of Kandy, Kegalle and Moneragala districts.

Credit facilities under this project are provided for on-farm crop development, pri­vate nursery development and on-farm post-harvest handling and processing activities of perennial crops. As at end 1991 Rs. 5.6 million had been disbursed by the Central Bank as refinance.

A study was undertaken in the three districts of Kandy, Kegalle and Matale in November 1991 in order, to review progress and to identify problems connected with the disbursement of funds under ADB - Small Holder Tea Development Project and the Perennial Crop Development Project Credit Schemes.

During the year 1991, the Central Bank approved 11 acceptance credit limits amounting to Rs. 13.7 million under the Central Bank's Inland Bill Scheme. This scheme was introduced in 1989 in order to assist green leaf suppliers and BLF owners in the tea sector. Subsequently this scheme was extended to provide financial assistance to buyers and sellers of milk through the Nuwara Eliya RRDB.

REGIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS (RRDBs)

Following the trend witnessed since the establishment of RRDBs in 1985, the activi­ties of RRDBs, in mobilising savings, extending credit and providing other facilities and services for the development of the rural economy expanded further during 1991 making these a key element in the institutional framework for rural development.

Establishment of RRDBs and Expansion of Branch Network

With the establishment of 3 new RRDBs in the administrative districts of Polonnaruwa, Matale and Ratnapura during the current year, the total number of RRDBs in operation increased from 12 to, 15 by the end of 1991. Meanwhile, 23 new RRDB branches were opened during 1991 bringing the total number of branches from 101 in 1990 to 124.

Deposit Mobilisation

Continuing the trend indicated during the past six years, mobilisation of rural savings by RRDBs expanded further both in respect of the number of savings and fixed deposit accounts from 309,616 with a value of Rs. 314 million in 1990 to 423,680 with an aggregate value of Rs. 438 million in 1991. These were increases of 114,064 accounts or 37 per cent and Rs. 124 million or 39 per cent, respectively over the corresponding figures recorded during the previous year. Introduction of new savings schemes, attrac­tive rates of interest on deposits, expansion of the RRDB network, the upsurge witnessed

in rural economic activities and the improved security situation were the contributory factors for this favourable development in 1991. Of the total value of outstanding depos­its in 1991 savings deposits amounted to Rs. 388 million while the balance Rs. SO million was in the form of fixed deposits.

Loan Operations

In response to a long-felt need for improving access to credit in the rural sector, the RRDBs since mid-80s have continuously increased the flow of credit to that sector through several credit schemes. The total value of loans (outstanding) extended by RRDBs for a wide spectrum of economic activities increased from Rs. 517 million in 1990 to Rs. 806 million in 1991 recording an increase of 56 per cent. Loans granted during the current year, benefited the areas of agriculture, small scale industries, trade and commerce and a wide range of self employment ventures. In keeping with the trend observed in the past, of the total value of loans outstanding as at end 1991, the major share amounting to 45 per cent had been extended for agricultural purposes principally for the cultivation of paddy and a variety of subsidiary food crops. However, the percent­age share of agricultural credit in the total loan portfolio of RRDBs as at the end of the current year, recorded a decline, from 52 per cent in 1990 to 45 per cent in 1991. The loans outstanding in respect of trade and commerce sectors at Rs. 86 million in 1991 accounted for only 11 per cent of the total reflecting the bias towards production related activities. A noteworthy feature in the loan operations of RRDBs during the past few

XXV

years is the progressive annual increase in the amount of loans disbursed against the pledge of gold articles. These loans which were extended for a wide range of activities increased from Rs. 94 million in 1990 to Rs. 154 million in 1991. This has played a significant role in weaning away the rural people from the high cost informal financial sector.

Other Activities

During the current year, RRDBs continued to expand their support extended towards achieving the Government objective of alleviating poverty in the rural sector by provid­ing financial assistance for income generating activities. The RRDBs, during the year under review granted Rs. 112 million to 9,222 borrowers for self employment ventures under the All Island Self Employment Credit Scheme sponsored by the Central Bank. Performance of the RRDBs under this scheme reflects a significant improvement in 1991 in comparison with a total of Rs. 18 million granted in 1990 creating 1,779 job opportuni­ties during that year. At the end of the first round of the Janasaviya Scheme, RRDBs, collectively, in the districts where the scheme and the RRDBs were operative granted 3,197 loans amounting to Rs. 20 million creating 4,102 employment opportunities. As at end of the current year, under the second round of the Janasaviya Scheme, RRDBs had granted Rs. 12 million generating 2,329 job opportunities.

Recognising the need to take effective measures to overcome the marketing prob­lems faced by the farmers, RRDBs during the period under review, have taken several steps to strengthen and improve agricultural marketing strategies. With a view to assist the farmers to sell their produce after harvesting at remunerative prices, storage facilities were provided to store paddy and other subsidiary food crops by 5 RRDBs during 1991. RRDBs obtained 8 stores from the Paddy Marketing Board at Rajanganaya, Meegalewa, Morayaya, Anamaduwa, Sooriya-Ara, Hingurakgoda, Galewela and Weerawila for pro­viding storage facilities to their clients. RRDBs also provided opportunities and facilities to borrowers to sell their produce and extended short-term credit against the produce stored to enable farmers meet their urgent cash requirements. Supply of agricultural inputs at reasonable costs to farmers was another facility extended by the RRDBs in 1991. As at end of the current year, RRDBs distributed seed paddy, fertilizers, agro chemicals and agricultural implements to the value of Rs. 4.2 million.

With a view to popularising a new instrument in the rural sector and also to finance the working capital requirements of the dairy sector, the Nuwara Eliya RRDB in March, 1991 joined the Inland Bill Scheme. During the 9 month period the scheme was in operation, 1299 inland bills amounting to approximately Rs. 1 million to finance the processing of 246,538 litres of milk have been issued by the RRDB.

The RRDBs during 1991 continued its role in educating the rural masses on banking facilities offered by RRDBs, savings habits etc. through Janahamuwas.

Sri Lanka Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project

The Small Farmers and Landless Credit (SFLC) Project took off the ground in 1990, with the goal of raising the general welfare of approximately 32,870 impoverished rural

XXVI

households through the provision of a cost effective credit delivery system and other support services and to aid economic development in general, in the districts of Kandy, Puttalam, Galle and Matara.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is the Executing Agency for the Project funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CBDA). The Project provides a sum of Rs. 754 million (US$ 17.8 million) approximately of which the Government contribution is 23 per cent of total Project cost. A further 3 per cent comes from beneficiary savings.

The Project objectives are to develop an effective credit delivery mechanism for channelling institutional credit to the rural poor, who are below the abject poverty line to meet their short and medium term credit requirements. The Project also aims at providing collateral free loans whilst infusing credit discipline into the scheme and also encourages women's participation to the extent of not less than 40 per cent of the targets. Another broad objective is to bring about greater mobilisation of rural savings for reinvestment at the regional level.

The Project is managed through a Project Central Office (PCO) established in the Banking Development Department (BDD) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. It is linked to the District Offices which are located in close proximity to Regional Rural Develop­ment Banks (RRDBs) in the four districts. The Project District Offices were opened and the credit scheme inaugurated in Puttalam and Kandy in May, 1990 and in Galle and Matara in December, 1990.

The estimated number of beneficiaries in the Puttalam and Kandy districts was in the region of 18,770 and in Galle and Matara 14,100. In terms of loans granted to the project beneficiaries the total number and the amount disbursed in the two districts of Kandy and Puttalam increased considerably during the year under review. Likewise savings mobili­sation from among the beneficiaries increased from Rs. • 524 million as at 31st Decem­ber, 1990 to Rs. 2.7 million at the end of 31st December, 1991.

The aggregate of loans disbursed in Kandy and Puttalam districts upto 31st Decem­ber, 1990 was Rs.3.9 million and as at end 1991 it was Rs. 20.2 million bringing the cumulative total of loans disbursed to Rs. 24.1 million.

In the two districts of Galle and Matara the progress in credit operations has also been satisfactory. Total loans granted during the year 1991 was Rs. 6.9 million.

The loan recovery rates achieved so far have been satisfactory and averaged 91 per cent and 99 per cent on all payments falling due in the IFAD and CBDA districts, respectively.

A total of Rs. 31.0 million has been approved by way of Short and Medium Term Loans upto 31st December, 1991 to an aggregate of 5,372 beneficiaries in the four districts with an average loan size of about Rs. 5,800. Savings mobilisation activities also gathered momentum during the period under review and the group savings fund had increased to Rs. 3.4 million as at 31st December, 1991.

XXVII

The Participating Agencies play an important role in the preparation of potential beneficiary profiles by undertaking socio-economic surveys, formation of groups, mobili­sation of rural savings, providing training in beneficiary skills development, granting or recommending and assisting in the recovery of loans through peer pressure.

Training has been an integral part of project implementation and a sum of Rs. 35.7 million has been set apart for staff and beneficiary training. The group credit delivery mechanism through which funds are channelled to beneficiaries has not been widely attempted or tested by banks in Sri Lanka and effective staff and beneficiary training is therefore crucial to the success of the Project. Necessary steps have been taken to Partici­pating Agencies and entrepreneurial and management skills development and transfer of new technologies to the rural areas in order to improve production and productivity.

Non-Governmental Organisations such as District Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies (DTCCS), Women's Bureau, Lanka Manila Samithi, Dharma Vijaya Founda­tion and Foreign Agencies such as CARE International & UNICEF are participating in the implementation of the Project. RRDBs in the four districts have been assigned the key role of channelling credit to Project beneficiaries as the Participating Credit Institution of the Project.

RURAL BANKING & STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

The Rural Banking and Staff Training College (RB & STC) of the Central Bank conducted 97 training courses for 2,385 persons during 1991. This was a significant increase over the 50 courses conducted for 1,608 persons in 1990. Out of the 97 training courses, 63 courses were conducted in the outstations and were attended by 1,700 small-scale entrepreneurs and self-employed persons. Of these participants, 1,198 were beneficiaries of Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs). The balance 34 training courses were conducted for officers engaged in banking and allied sectors, and were attended by 685 persons. Out of these participants, 272 were from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 266 from commercial banks, 74 from RRDBs and 68 from Multi Purpose Co-operative Societies and other financial institutions and agencies such as finance com­panies, National Savings Bank and the 'Small Farmers and Landless Credit (IFAD) Project'.

Rural banking, project-oriented development, commercial banking, international trade, foreign exchange operations, hire purchase and lease financing, management, train­ing of trainers, monitoring and evaluation of projects, communication and small-scale entrepreneurs development were the main areas of training provided in 1991. In addition to the courses scheduled for 1991, the RB & STC conducted several special training courses on request, for the beneficiaries of the National Savings Bank's Rural Credit Pilot Project in the Matara District, officers attached to the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project and new recruits to the Ratnapura Regional Rural Development Bank.

During the year, a committee was appointed to review the training courses conducted by the RB & STC and their relevance in the context of current developments. The report of the committee was submitted in October, 1991 and its recommendations were fol­lowed in designing and planning the programmes to be conducted in 1992.

EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND

In terms of the E.P.F. Act, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is charged with the responsibility of receiving contributions, surcharges and income from the investment of the monies of the Fund, maintaining proper accounts of registered employers and the individual members of the Fund and also effecting refund of benefits to its members. These activities of Employees' Provident Fund Department of the Central Bank were carried out in close co-operation with the Employees' Provident Fund Divi­sion of the Department of Labour which attends to the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the E.P.F. Act.

Contributions

The contributions received by the Fund during the year 1991 amounted to Rs. 4,421.3 million as against Rs. 3,909.5 million in 1990. This represents and increase of Rs. 511.8 million or 13 per cent over the level of contributions received during the previ­ous year.

Members' Balances

Members' balances as at 31st December 1991, before allocation of interest for the year under review stood at Rs. 43,768.7 million which is an increase of Rs. 7,471.0 million or 20.5 per cent over that of 1990.

Investments

During the year under review, the Fund invested a sum of Rs. 16,014.4 million in Government Securities, Treasury bills and Inter Bank Call Money market (since October 21st, 1991), as against a sum of Rs. 11,044.7 million in 1990. This is an increase of Rs. 4,967.7 million over the level of investments in 1990. The total investments held by the Fund as at 31st December, 1991 amounted to Rs. 46,246.3 million which is an in­crease of Rs. 7,779.6 million over the level of 1990. This includes a sum of Rs. 20.0 mil­lion invested in the Call Money Market.

Income Received from Investments

In terms of an amendment to the Inland Revenue Act in 1989, the exemption from income tax granted to EPF was withdrawn. Accordingly, all income earned on investment with effect from 1989.04.01 is subject to a Withholding Tax of 10 per cent. The total Withholding Tax deducted from the investment income for the year 1991 was Rs. 564.8 million.

In 1991, the income received from investments amounted to Rs. 5,091.7 million as against Rs. 4,187.6 million in 1990, recording an increase of Rs. 904.1 million.

Refunds

The total sum paid out by way of refund of E.P.F. benefits to members during the year 1991, amounted to Rs. 1,344.2 million as against Rs. 1,209.3 million in 1990. This

XXIX

records a increase of Rs. 134.9 million or 11.1 per cent. During the year under review 38,910 claims for refund of benefits were paid out, as against 44,813 claims disposed of in 1990.

Interest on Members' Balances

The Employees' Provident Fund is required to pay interest on members' Balances as at the end of each year out of the income from investment of monies of the Fund. The rate of interest payable on members' balances as at the end of 1991 was 11.5 per cent per annum.

Interest is paid on the cumulative balance standing to the credit of members at the end of the year. All contributions received during the year irrespective of the date of receipt of such monies qualify for the payment of the interest for the entire year - e.g. contributions received in December attracts interest for the full year in the same way as contributions received in January of that year. Therefore,the effective rate of interest is somewhat higher.

EPF Housing Loan Scheme

The E.P.F. Act was amended by Act No.42 of 1988 to enablethe members to obtain a loan of upto 75 per cent of the balance standing to their credit from certain lending institutions for housing purposes. The participating lending institutions in this scheme are Housing Development Finance Corporation, National Housing Development Authority, State Mortgage and Investment Bank, People's Bank, Bank of Ceylon, National Savings Bank and the Multipurpose Co-operative Societies spread out in the country.

EXCHANGE CONTROL

The following changes were effected by the Central Bank in exchange control proce­dures during 1991:

XXX

1. Imports

(a) Import of Raw Materials under the Manufacture-in-Bond Scheme

The scheme implemented originally on a trial basis to enable export oriented garment manufacturers to import their raw materials on 120 days deferred pay­ment terms (D/A) and documents on payment terms (D/P) without establishing Letters of Credit (Operating Instructions No.EC/4/90(B) of 23.01.90) was ex­tended periodically. The same concession which was extended to the import of rough gemstones excluding diamonds by the export oriented calibrated gemstone industry with a reduced tenure of 90 days (Operating Instructions No.EC/5/90(B) of 26.01.90) was allowed to lapse at the end of March, 1991 as no industrialist had utilised this facility during the period this scheme was in operation. However, on representations made by the export oriented diamond industry the scheme has been revised and the import of diamonds too has been brought within its scope (Operating Instructions No.EC/113/91(B) dated 1991.12.11).

(b) Establishment of Letters of Credit for imports on Deferred Payment Terms (D/A)

Grant of deferred payment facilities for the import of goods in respect of high priority areas (eg. export and development oriented industries and agriculture) and for very essential items (eg. infant milk powder, pharmaceuticals and education) has been delegated to Authorised Dealers. (Operating Instructions No.EC/112/ 91(B) dated 11th December, 1991). However, this facility is not extended to foreign controlled companies i.e., where more than 50 per cent of equity is held by non-residents, for the importation of capital goods although such imports may fall within the categories of imports referred to above.

(c) Establishment of Letters of Credit on F.O.B. and C & I terms

Authorised Dealers are permitted to establish Letters of Credit on f.o.b. or C & I terms without the prior approval of the Exchange Control Department permit­ting the carriage of goods on any vessel or aircraft (Operating Instructions No.EC/ 33/91 (B) dated 1991.05.23). This amendment no longer requires the carriage of goods being confined only to the national carrier or the necessity of obtaining a waiver from the national carrier permitting the transport of goods on any vessel belonging to other carriers.

(d) Tractors

The condition requiring that four wheeled tractors imported 'should not be more than 5 years old' which was operative for a period of one year ending 30th November, 1990 has been extended upto the end of 30th November, 1991. (Oper­ating Instructions No.EC/04/91(B) dated 1991.05.31).

(e) Protective Helmets

Consequent on the formulation ofregulations by the Ministry of Transport & Highways, protective helmets now imported should conform to the specifications

XXXI

stipulated in the Sri Lanka Standard 517:1981 "Specifications for protective hel­mets for vehicle users". (Operating Instructions No.EC/34/91(B) dated 1991.05.31).

(f) Import of goods for personal use of the importer

The ceiling on the import of goods for personal use of the importer and for raw materials for industry and for spare parts for machinery (not in commercial quantities) has been enhanced from US$ 500 to US$ 1,000 CIF Colombo. (Oper­ating Instructions No.EC/47/91(B) dated 1991.07.12).

2. Exports

(a) Following activities were delegated to Authorised Dealers:

i. Export of coffee and scrap metals. (EC/108/91(H) dated 1991.11.28).

ii. Remittance of repair charges, developing and printing of films and colour separation (EC/100/91(H) dated 1991.11.25).

iii. Export of personal jewellery, personal effects, items sent for repairs and return, export of cinematic film for developing and printing abroad (EC/104/ 91(H) dated 1991.11.28).

iv. Non-commercial exports against foreign remittances received, funds brought in on International Credit Cards (EC/105/91(H) dated 1991.11.28).

v. Gifts and trade samples upto US $ 3,500 (EC/106/91(H) dated 1991.11.28).

vi. Remittances on claims on exports (short weight & quality) (EC/107/91 (H) dated 1991.11.28).

(b) Re-export of personal items brought in by passengers

The Director General of Customs was informed on the re-export of personal items (eg. Lap Top Computers and electronic equipment) brought into Sri Lanka by passengers arriving from abroad to be allowed without reference to Exchange Control Department.

(c) Foreign Currency Loans to Exporters

Consequent to the restrictions of Rupee refinance facilities to exporters, com­mercial banks were permitted to grant foreign currency loans from their FCBUs to exporters for financing the import of inputs required for the purpose of executing export orders. This facility is limited to 70 per cent of the total value of the confirmed export order (Operating Instructions No.EC/66/91 (C&F) dated 1991.09.20).

In August 1991, the foreign currency borrowing facility was also granted to tea exporters to finance their pre-shipment credit requirements upto 75 per cent of

XXXII

the invoice value. This facility expired on 31.12.1991 (Operating Instructions No.EC/70/91 (C&F) dated 1991.09.26).

Travel

REGIONAL OFFICES - MATARA, ANURADHAPURA~&-MAJFALE

During the year 1991, the three Regional Offices of the Central Bank at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale continued their development activities in addition to perform­ing traditional Central Banking functions assigned to them in their respective regions.

XXXVI

Development work performed by the Regional Offices included identification, ap­praisal, and recommendation of viable projects to credit institutions for financing, post supervision of such projects, monitoring rural credit schemes refinanced by the Central Bank, conducting beneficiary training programmes and seminars, identification of re­sources in the regions and coordination of the activities of government departments and agencies and organisations involved in development work in the respective regions.

In regard to development banking activities, the emphasis of the Regional Offices was centered on the implementation of the All Island Self-Employment Credit Scheme under which the Matara Regional Office recommended 575 projects with a total value of Rs. 5.6 million to credit institutions participating in the scheme, for financing during 1991. The Matara Regional Office also continued to provide its services under other refinance loan schemes,i.e. in the preparation of farm budgets and cash flow statements, the provision of guidance to participating banks, other agencies and the public. These schemes comprised the Small Holder Tea Development Project and the Perennial Crop Development Project. A seminar was also held at the Matara Regional Office to enhance the knowledge of the officers of the implementing agencies on matters relating to the Small Holder Tea Development Project in collaboration with the Regional Office of the Tea Small Holder Development Authority.

The Anuradhapura Regional Office recommended 217 small scale development project loans valued at Rs. 4 million under the All Island Self-Employment Credit Scheme. In respect of the Livestock Development Scheme and the All Island Farm Machinery Scheme the Regional Office recommended 68 and 8 loans, respectively, for bank financing during the year 1991. The Regional Office also encouraged the promotion of big onion cultivation and upgrading the breed of cattle.

During the year under review, the Matale Regional Office recommended 690 self-employment project loans under the All Island Self-Employment Credit Scheme aggregating to Rs. 10.1 million. Under the Livestock Development Scheme,168 projects aggregating Rs. 2.6 million were recommended to the lending banks for funding. Further, the Regional Office recommended 59 loans to the value of Rs. 1.1 million under the All Island Farm Machinery Credit Scheme during the year under review. They have also carried out 143 inspections in respect of the Small Holder Tea Development Project and directed such projects to the respective banks for financing. A pilot project on potato cultivation was undertaken during the 1991/92 Maha season and training and credit facilities were provided to 31 farmers. As in the previous year, the Matale Regional Office assisted in the marketing of products of small scale industrialists who were identi­fied by the Regional Office for financing by banks in the region. Three exhibition-cum-sales were organised successfully during the year.

The Regional Offices also continued to hold credit camps for the disbursal and recovery of agricultural loans under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme. The Anuradhapura and the Matale Regional Offices conducted 9 and 17 such camps, respec­tively in their regions during the year 1991. The Regional Offices also organised a number of beneficiary training programmes and seminars for farmers, unemployed youths and Janasaviya recipients. The Regional Offices also continued to hold village level meetings and "Janahamuwas" in order to identify constraints in the credit delivery system and to provide participants with relevant information regarding the use of banking facilities.

XXXVII

In addition to these activities, the Regional Offices initiated work on resource sur­veys in their respective regions. These surveys were intended to collect information on the resources available in the region and help plan mobilise them for income generating activities.

Currency units which were opened at the Matara and Anuradhapura Regional Offices in 1990, continued to provide currency exchange facilities to commercial banks, institu­tions and the general public in the respective areas. These two Regional Offices also provided the commercial banks with cash deposit and withdrawal facilities at their vaults. During the year under review, a "Clean Currency Notes Week" was conducted by the Matara Regional Office in an attempt to educate the public on the need to ensure the cleanliness of the currency notes in circulation. This programme would be expanded to cover the other regions in due course.

The Regional Offices also continued the sale of Treasury Bills during 1991. The Matara Regional Office sold Treasury Bills to the value of Rs. 182 million reflecting an increase of 43 per cent compared to the previous year. Treasury bills amounting to Rs. 142 million and Rs. 102 million were sold by the Anuradhapura and Matale Regional Offices respectively, both recording a decrease in comparison with the corresponding figures for 1990.

The Regional Cheque Clearing facilities offered to commercial banks by the Re­gional Offices continued during the year 1991. In all 135,314 cheques to the value of Rs. 2020 million had been cleared in the Regional Cheque Clearing House at Matara while the Anuradhapura Cheque Clearing House cleared 89,791 cheques valued at Rs. 550 million.

INFORMATION AND PUBLICATIONS

In respect of important data pertaining to the development efforts, development strategies and bank's assistance thereto, the Information Department maintained an on-going effort to be in the forefront in fulfilling its role as collector/disseminator of information both published and hitherto unpublished. It has kept track of the recent trends in socio-economic development and provided material for studies by researchers and students. With this in view, the department printed and provided for the dissemination of the following Central Bank publications to the public.

1. Annual Report for 1990 (Sinhala, Tamil oVEnglish)

2. Economic Survey - first half of 1991, (Sinhala, TanuT&JEnglish)

The department continued to publish the 'Satahana', 'News Survey', 'Banku Puvath* and put out a pamphlet giving details to the public, of facets of Sri Lanka's Liberalised Economy.

The Library, the main data and information base of the department, added 858 books and pamphlets and has subscribed to 244 periodical titles. It also received 153 books and pamphlets by way of gifts and exchange from the Asia Foundation, Banks and other institutions. This enabled it to enhance its data base further during the course of the year.

A close rapport with the mass media was maintained and in this regard several press conferences and a number of press releases were issued during the course of the year.

Advertisements, which also formed an avenue for dissemination of information were developed in the department without resort to expertise from outside sources and the visuals produced were upto professional standards.

Video coverage of important events, most of which were passed on to the Rupavahini Corporation to be included in their news cast helped to increase the portfolio of visuals in storage.

During the year the Department launched educational programmes via radio and Rupavahini. A programme to highlight the economic liberalisation process, its effective­ness and impact was conducted both over Radio and Rupavahini. The participants at these programmes, which were bi-lingual, comprised 27 senior officials of the Bank, and took the form of panel discussions.

The Bank Press undertook around 75 per cent of the printing, and aforementioned publications were part of its work. Considering the market prices in relation to the actual cost incurred by the Bank for the printing assignments handled during 1991 there had been a minimum net saving of approximately Rs. 1.5 million on account of printing for the year 1991. First phase of the expansion programme has been completed. With the installation of new machinery it has been able to handle 4 colour printing as well.

The Department continued to maintain its network of sales outlets, and we were able to reach a wider sphere of readership through sale by RRDBs which were opened during the course of the year.

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

The officers of the Bank undertook a number of research studies both on their own initiative and also to meet the demands made by the other organisations. They included policy oriented research as well as studies with largely of academic interest. Eight of these studies have been published in the Central Bank's Staff Studies. Volumes 20 & 21.
