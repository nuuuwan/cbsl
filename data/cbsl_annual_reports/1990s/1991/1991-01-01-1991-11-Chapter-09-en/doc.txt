OVERALL TRENDS

Reversing a favourable trend observed over the last two years, the budgetary opera­tions in 1991 witnessed some slippages in fiscal performance. Inspite of the policy thrust placed on achieving a viable fiscal balance, the overall revenue/GDP ratio fell from 21.2 per cent in 1990 to 20.3 per cent in 1991, while sustaining the current expenditure/GDP ratio at 22.3 per cent-almost the same level as in the previous year. The inadequate growth in government revenue and the enhanced demand for current expenditure thus contributed to enlarge the current account deficit/GDP ratio from 1.2 per cent in 1990 to 2 per cent in 1991 undermining the required adjustment in the current account of the budget. Moreover, capital expenditure and net lending inclusive of the restructuring cost of public enterprises rose from 8.8 per cent of GDP to 9.5 per cent of GDP augmenting the overall expenditure/GDP ratio from 31.1 per cent in 1990 to 31.9 per cent in 1991, although the increase can partly be attributed to a once-and-for-all expenditure item of around Rs.5,500 million (1.5 per cent of GDP) on account of the public sector retrench­ment and restructuring programme. The revenue and expenditure trends thus resulted in an overall deficit/GDP ratio of 11.6 per cent in 1991 as compared to 9.9 per cent in 1990 reversing the downward trend of the deficit/GDP ratio maintained since 1988.

In financing the budget deficit, domestic borrowings were contained at 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1991 as compared to 5.3 per cent in 1990 due to a substantial increase in foreign aid available under the economic restructuring credit for budgetary purposes during the year. However, domestic borrowings in 1991 exceeding the original target of 2.2 per cent of GDP by a considerable margin underscored the need for greater fiscal adjustments particularly at a time when the demand for investible resources from other sectors remained buoyant.

FISCAL OUTTURN

Government revenue at Rs. 76,179 million recorded an overall growth of 12 per cent in 1991. Inspite of enhanced revenue collections from import duties, excise levies, manufacturing turnover taxes, income taxes and interest income, the overall revenue growth fell below the increase in the nominal GDP largely owing to a moderate growthrm turnover taxes on imports and a precipitous decline in export taxes. Accordingly, the revenue/GDP ratio stood at 20.3 per cent in 1991, a percentage point lower than the previous year.

On the expenditure front, current expenditure aggregating Rs. 83,756 million marked an increase of 17 per cent in 1991. Despite the continued restraint on operational expenditure of the Government, unanticipated large expenditure on defence contributed to augment the outlays on goods and services in relation to GDP from 9.4 per cent in 1990 to 9.5 per cent in 1991. Similarly, the considerable expenditure incurred on the Government's retrenchment programme and refugees was conducive to maintaining current transfers to households at 5.8 per cent of GDP as compared to 4.7 per cent in 1990. In contrast, interest payments on the Government debt as a percentage of GDP declined to 5.9 in 1991 from 6.4 in 1990. Hence, the current expenditure/GDP ratio remained at 22.3 per cent - almost the same level as in the previous year.

115

Reflecting the above trends in revenue and current expenditure, the current account of the budget was in deficit to the tune of Rs. 7,577 million-almost double the amount recorded in 1990. Accordingly, the current account deficit/GDP ratio deteriorated from 1.2 per cent in 1990 to 2 per cent in 1991. Meanwhile, capital expenditure and net lending in relation to GDP rose from 8.8 per cent in 1990 to 9.5 per cent in 1991 reflecting high restructuring expenditure on account of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), a large outflow through advance account operations and an enhanced expendi­ture on public investment projects. Accordingly, the overall expenditure/GDP ratio in 1991 moved from 31.1 per cent in 1990 to 31.9 per cent in 1991.

Fiscal operations in 1991 thus generated an overall budget deficit (before grants) of Rs. 43,348 million (11.6 per cent of GDP) in comparison to a deficit of Rs. 31,850 million (9.9 per cent of GDP) in the previous year. However, increased financial assist­ance through program loans made available by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Japan in support of the ongoing economic restructuring programme enabled the Government to contain domestic borrowings at Rs. 16,149 mil­lion (4.3 per cent of GDP) in comparison to Rs. 16,986 million (5.3 per cent of GDP) in 1990. In mobilising resources from domestic sources, almost the entirety of the domestic borrowing requirement was obtained from the non-bank sector. Although the overall domestic borrowings for budgetary purposes remained high, the Government avoided resorting to inflationary financing during the year. Meanwhile, total resources utilised by way of foreign loans and grants at Rs. 27,199 million (7.3 per cent of GDP) financed two-thirds of the deficit in 1991 as compared to 58 per cent in 1990. A summary of the Government fiscal operations during 1987-1991 is given in Table 1.49.

REVENUE

Government revenue in 1991 totalled Rs. 76,179 million registering a growth of 12 per cent over 1990. Tax revenue at Rs. 68,157 million accounted for 90 per cent of total revenue as in the previous year. Domestic goods and services constituted the most important tax base in the economy providing 47 per cent of total tax revenue. Mean­while, the share of international trade oriented taxes declined from 32 per cent in 1990 to 29 per cent in 1991 continuing the downward trend observed in recent years. The relative significance of income taxes increased from 12 per cent to 14 per cent in 1991.

Meanwhile, non-tax revenue totalling Rs. 8,022 million registered an increase of 19 per cent over 1990. Interest income at Rs. 2,617 million recorded a phenomenal growth of 129 per cent due mainly to an enhanced interest payment by the Ceylon Electricity Board. A transfer of Rs. 2,612 million by the Sri Lanka Telecom also contributed to the rise in non-tax revenue in 1991.

Revenue from taxes on domestic goods and services totalling Rs. 32,107 million in 1991 marked an increase of 12 per cent over the previous year. General sales and turnover taxes which formed two-thirds of taxes on domestic goods and services amounted to Rs. 21,430 million reflecting a moderate increase of 6 per cent over 1990. Revenue from manufacturing turnover taxes at Rs. 7,945 million rose by 17 per cent, keeping in line with the nominal growth in the value of industrial output in 1991. The reduction in turnover tax rates on banks from 5 per cent to 4 per cent and the transfer of turnover tax administration of wholesale and retail trade to Provincial Councils resulted in a lower collection of turnover taxes on non-manufacturing activities at Rs. 2,974 million. Despite an 18 per cent increase in the value of imports and a rise in the import

duty collection by 11 per cent, turnover taxes on imports at Rs. 10,511 million in 1991 registered only a moderate growth of 8 per cent.

Excise taxes at Rs. 10,597 million recording a substantial growth of 30 per cent accounted for a third of tax revenue from domestic goods and services. Taxes on liquor generating Rs. 3,126 million in 1991 remained buoyant due to the increase in the specific levy on liquor by Rs. 5/- per bottle at the end of 1990 and a further increase of Rs. 5/- per bottle in mid-1991. Meanwhile, the excise revenue from tobacco at Rs. 6,884 million in 1991 also recorded a higher increase of 26 per cent due to upward revisions made in the excise duty on cigarettes by Rs.0.15 per cigarette in mid-1991 and a further increase of Rs. 0.10 per cigarette in November, 1991. The revenue collection from new excise taxes at Rs. 587 million in 1991 reflected the full year revenue impact of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act introduced in November, 1990 which permits the imposition of excise levies on imported and domestically manufactured articles.

International trade oriented taxes raised a sum of Rs. 19,754 million in 1991 record­ing a marginal growth of 2 per cent over the previous year. Although the value of imports increased by 18 per cent during the year under review, import duties totalling Rs. 18,617 million registered a lower growth of 11 per cent. Accordingly, the average duty rate declined from 15.6 per cent in 1990 to 14.7 per cent in 1991. The reduction in nominal tariffs to a maximum of 50 per cent except for a few selected items in Novem­ber, 1990 and the introduction of a four-band tariff structure in November, 1991 are contributory factors for the moderate performance in external trade oriented taxes.

Revenue from export taxes totalling Rs. 1,137 million in 1991 registered a sharp decline of 55 per cent mainly due to unfavourable commodity prices and a reduction in export taxes. Revenue from export taxes on tea at Rs. 492 million in 1991 marked a decrease of nearly 70 per cent. The downward revisions made in both specific duty and ad-valorem tax on tea coupled with depressed prices prevailing during the year contrib­uted to an erosion of the tax base. Meanwhile, revenue from rubber exports also declined by 36 per cent to Rs. 476 million in 1991 mainly due to unfavourable developments in both production and prices. Furthermore, the export duty on rubber was also reduced to 30 per cent in October, 1991. Revenue from coconut taxes at Rs. 125 million in 1991 registered a 17 per cent drop over the previous year due to a reduction in tax rates and also the volume of export.

Income taxes generated Rs. 9,722 million in 1991 recording an increase of 33 per cent over the previous year. The personal income tax collection at Rs. 3,539 million registered an increase of 20 per cent while corporate income taxes at Rs. 6,183 million recorded a growth of 41 per cent. The cessation of existing tax holidays for exporters, restriction of the application of the low rate of company taxes for quoted public compa­nies and improvement in tax administration were instrumental in raising revenue from income taxes. Despite the reduction in stamp duty on Letters of Credit by half a percent­age point to 2.5 per cent, the revenue collection from stamp duties and property transfer taxes at Rs. 3,541 million recorded an increase of 13 per cent. This was partly due to a better collection from wealth taxes and partly to the application of stamp duties on the full value of Letters of Credit. A statistical summary of Government revenue is given in Table 1.50.

FOREIGN GRANTS

Total foreign grants utilised for budgetary operations in 1991 was Rs. 7,870 million as compared to Rs. 6,697 million in the previous year. Accordingly, total foreign grants in relation to GDP, remained at 2.1 per cent in 1991 as in 1990. Total project grants at Rs. 5,191 million was 11 per cent lower than the project grants utilised in the previous year. However, receipts of commodity and food-aid grants totalling Rs. 2,679 million registered a more than two-fold increase over 1990. The Governments of Japan and the U.S.A. continued to be the largest donors in providing outright grants to Sri Lanka.

CURRENT EXPENDITURE

The current expenditure at Rs. 83,756 million reflecting an increase of 17 per cent accounted for 70 per cent of the total expenditure in 1991. Current outlays on the pur­chase of goods and services totalling Rs. 35,583 million witnessed a sharp rise of 18 per cent. Accordingly, these expenditures accounted for 42 per cent of current expenditure as in 1990. Despite an increase in current transfers by 25 per cent to Rs. 26,100 million, the share of such transfer payments in total current expenditure rose to 31 per cent from 29 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile, interest payments on Government debt at Rs. 22,073 million recording a moderate growth of 7 per cent accounted for 26 per cent of current expenditure, as against 29 per cent in 1990.

The expenditure on goods and services in 1991 consisted of Rs. 17,985 million on account of salaries and wages and Rs. 17,598 million for other goods and services. Despite the retirement of nearly 40,000 government employees under the retrenchment scheme of 1990, the total expenditure on salaries and wages still recorded a rise of 14 per cent owing to the increase in the cost of living allowance by Rs. 200 - Rs. 300 per month per employee and an expansion in armed services during the year. Hence, the share of salaries and wages continued to account for a fifth of total current expenditure as in the previous years. Although stringent measures were continued to restrain expenditure particularly on other goods and services which include travelling expenses, supplies, purchase of materials, electricity and communication charges, the overall expenses on other goods and services registered a sharp increase of 22 per cent in 1991 owing to enhanced expenditure on defence related goods and services.

In 1991, current transfers aggregating Rs. 26,100 million accelerated its growth to 25 per cent in 1991 from 23 per cent recorded in 1990. The decline in current transfers to public corporations and expenditure on welfare programmes excluding those on refugees were conducive to moderating the trend in transfer payments. Transfers to public corpo­rations inclusive of operational losses of the Sri Lanka Railways and the Postal Depart­ment declined to Rs. 2,009 million, a reduction of 24 per cent over the previous year. Similarly, welfare expenditure consisting of Food Stamps, Kerosene Stamps, Mid-day Meal and the Janasaviya Programme totalling Rs. 7,808 million recorded a reduction of 7 per cent due to better targeting of these Programmes. However, the expenditure on other household transfers which included Rs. 2,600 million on account of refugee expenses, rose to Rs. 4,907 million in 1991 registering a sharp increase of 80 per cent.

The expenditure on pension inclusive of, once and for all retrenchment gratuity payments in 1991 totalled Rs. 8,832 million - almost double the commitments in 1990. This phenomenal rise was largely attributed to the increase in the number of pensioners

122

by about 40,000 in 1991 who were also paid generous gratuity payments under the government retrenchment scheme of 1990.

Interest payments on government debt totalling Rs. 22,073 million marked a moder­ate increase of 7 per cent as compared to a 44 per cent rise in the previous year. While interest payments on foreign debt increased by 12 per cent, such payments on domestic debt grew only by 6 per cent. Total interest payments of Rs.10,410 million on Treasury bills which formed 48 per cent of total domestic debt recorded an increase of 9 per cent while those on rupee loans at Rs. 7*695 million registered a rise of 12 per cent owing to higher interest rates and an enhanced volume of outstanding short term domestic debt in 1991.

On a functional basis, nearly 40 per cent of the total current expenditure was allo­cated for social services including education and health- Total expenditure on these services at Rs. 31,594 million in 1991 recorded a substantial rise of 29 per cent due to increased costs of pension and gratuity payments. While expenditure on education and health declined marginally from 3.8 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 3.2 per cent of GDP in 1991, other welfare expenditure which included the Janasaviya, Food Stamp scheme, refugee expenses etc. rose from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.8 per cent of GDP. Meanwhile, the total cost of pension as a ratio of GDP increased from 1.4 per cent in 1990 to 2.4 per cent in 1991.

Current expenditure on general public services which include defence, public order and safety at Rs. 19,811 million registering an increase of 10 per cent accounted for about a fourth of the total current outlays in 1991. Meanwhile, total current expenditure on defence and national security at Rs. 14,199 million moderated its increase to 25 per cent in 1991 from the marked rise of 55 per cent in the previous year. Accordingly, these expenditures in relation to GDP rose from 3.5 per cent to 3.8 per cent. Current expendi­ture channelled for economic services for the provision of general extension services and maintenance also rose from 1.6 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 1991.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE & NET LENDING

Total capital expenditure and net lending in 1991 amounted to Rs. 35,771 million. This reflected an increase of 28 per cent in comparison to a growth of 11 per cent in the previous year. However, the public investment proper rose only moderately from Rs. 26,748 million (8.3 per cent of GDP) in 1990 to Rs.32,590 million (8.7 per cent of GDP) in 1991. Capital expenditure directly incurred by Ministries and Departments for the construction and maintenance of fixed assets totalled Rs. 14,888 million recording an increase of 28 per cent as against a decline of 11 per cent witnessed in the previous year. Moreover, capital transfers provided for the statutory boards and corporations engaged in the implementation of the Public Investment Programme (PIP) amounting to Rs. 9,830 million registered an increase of 50 per cent as against a decline of 4 per cent in 1990. Of the total capital transfers, a sum of Rs. 7,110 million was utilised in major public investment projects undertaken by the Road Development Authority (RDA), the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), the Mahaweli Development Authority (MDA) and the Sri Lanka Telecom.

In line with the objectives of the public investment programme, the Government also provided a sum of Rs. 6,622 million by way of on-lending to commercial public enter­prises, of which nearly 60 per cent was allocated to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for ongoing development work on the Samanalawewa and Rantambe power projects.

During 1991, the Government incurred Rs. 3,335 million for the implementation of the restructuring programme of the Sri Lanka Transport Board. (SLTB) under which a substantial portion of its operations was brought under peoplised companies. The re­structuring cost also covered expenses in connection with the settlement of provident fund balances of Rs. 1,500 million and retrenchment of about 12,500 employees of the SLTB. Meanwhile, under the ongoing peoplisation programme, the Government was able to divest the ownership of a number of public enterprises such as the Ceylon Leather Corporation, Lanka Oxygen, Hunas Falls Hotel Limited, Lanka-Loha Hardware Limited, Pugoda Textile Mills Limited etc. which generated Rs. 841 million. Hence, the net restructuring cost during 1991 resulted in a budgetary burden of Rs. 2,494 million.

Meanwhile, the advance account operations which generally constitutes a major drain on the budget resulted in a net out-payment of Rs. 1,819 million adding further pressure on expenditure in 1991. The Government also recovered a sum of Rs. 1,132 million from loans to various enterprises. Hence, the combined effect of these transac­tions resulted in a net lending to the tune of Rs. 9,803 million, an increase of 10 per cent over the previous year. An economic classification of government expenditure is given in table 1.51.

As in the previous years, a great bulk of the public investment in 1991 was also routed for the development and rehabilitation of infrastructure facilities. Thus, investment directed for the development of economic infrastructure facilities aggregating Rs. 26,314 million marked a substantial increase of 37 per cent. Accordingly, the public investment as a ratio of GDP rose to 7.0 per cent in 1991 from 6.0 per cent in 1990. Moreover, nearly two-thirds of such investment was channelled for the development of the energy, water supply and transport and communication sub-sectors. Meanwhile, capital expenditure provided for social services at Rs. 2,964 million remained more or less at the previous year's level. Hence, as a proportion of GDP such investment declined marginally to 0.8 per cent in 1991 from 0.9 per cent in the previous year. The public expenditure in general administration and other services also dipped to a level of 1.0 per cent of GDP from 1.4 per cent in 1990. A statistical summary of the functional classification of Government expenditure is presented in table 1.52.

FINANCING OF THE BUDGET DEFICIT

The budget deficit (after grants) in 1991 totalling Rs. 35,478 million marked a sharp increase of 41 per cent over the deficit of Rs. 25,969 million in the previous year. In financing this deficit, the Government utilised a sum of Rs. 25,327 million through concessionary foreign loans, of which a sum of Rs.l2,816 million was on account of programme loans earmarked to support the ongoing structural adjustment programme. However, net foreign borrowings for budgetary purposes during the year totalled Rs.19,329 million as repayments on foreign debt amounted to Rs. 4,881 million. Net foreign borrowings mobilised in the previous year amounted to Rs. 11,644 million.

Domestic gross borrowings inclusive of Rs. 1,667 million on account of administra­tive borrowings for budgetary purposes in 1991 totalled to Rs. 33,390 million. In raising resources from domestic sources, the Government mobilised a gross amount of Rs. 26,004 million from non-bank sources through floatation of Rupee Securities, and a further sum of Rs. 2,218 million through the issue of Treasury bills during the year. A noteworthy feature of the Rupee Loan Programme in 1991 was the issue of short term (one year maturity) securities to the tune of Rs. 4,000 million - a departure from the

traditional practice of floating only medium and long term Rupee securities. However, in mobilising these resources from non-bank sources the Government continued to rely almost exclusively on traditional captive sources such as the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), the National Savings Bank (NSB) and the Employees Trust Fund (ETF).

Although borrowings made through Central Bank Provisional Advances and the net sale of Treasury bills to the banking system resulted in a gross borrowing of Rs. 3,464 million from the banking system, the overall budgetary operation ended up with a net cash balance of Rs. 876 million due to a build-up of deposit balances in the banking system by Rs. 4,340 million at the end of the year. However, this net cash build-up fell short by Rs. 3,624 million from the original target of Rs.4,500 million envisaged in the 1991 budget. Accordingly, the contractionary effect of budgetary operations in 1991 was well below the original expectations.

GOVERNMENT DEBT

Total Government debt of Rs. 366,697 million as at end of 1991 registered an increase of 18 per cent over the debt stock of Rs.310,779 million at the end of 1990. The domestic debt at Rs. 152,118 million accounting for 41 per cent of the total debt recorded an increase of 14 per cent. Moreover, short term (maturity within one year) domestic debt at Rs. 84,503 million registering an equally high growth sustained the share of such debt at 56 per cent. Meanwhile, the outstanding domestic debt held by the non-bank sector at Rs. 99,132 million showed a growth of 18 per cent while the debt held by the banking sector totalling Rs. 52,146 million also recorded a moderate increase of 8 per cent. Accordingly, the share of debt held by the banking sector declined marginally to 34 per cent in 1991 from 36 per cent in 1990. Meanwhile, the outstanding liability on account of foreign debt at Rs. 214,579 million, of which nearly 80 per cent was in the form of project loans, marked an increase of 21 per cent, from Rs. 176,883 recorded in the previous year. A statistical summary of government debt is given in Table 1.53.

Domestic Debt

Total domestic debt of Rs. 152,118 million in 1991 registered an increase of 14 per cent over the previous year's outstanding debt of Rs. 133,896 million. The debt held by the banking system amounted to Rs. 52,146 million at the end of the year as compared to Rs. 48,254 million an year ago. Moreover, the debt held by the Central Bank at Rs. 42,487 million recorded a growth of 15 per cent mainly due to an increase in the outstanding liability on account of Treasury bills from Rs. 30,654 million in 1990 to Rs. 35,032 million at the end of 1991. In contrast, the liabilities against commercial banks declined by 14 per cent to Rs. 9,659 million in 1991 due to reduced liabilities by way of both Treasury bills and Rupee securities.

At the end of 1991, total short term debt amounted to Rs.84,503 million registering an increase of 14 per cent over 1990. As in the previous year, short term debt accounted for 56 per cent of the domestic debt. The outstanding Treasury bills liability which formed nearly 90 per cent of short term debt amounted to Rs. 72,968 million. However, its share in the total short term debt fell from 91 per cent in the previous year to 86 per cent in 1991 due to the issue of Rupee securities of one year's duration in 1991. Mean­while, medium and long term debt consisting of mainly Rupee securities rose by Rs. 8,202 million to Rs. 67,615 million accounting for approximately 44 per cent of total domestic debt as in 1990.

The outstanding liabilities on Rupee securities at Rs.66,824 million in 1991 regis­tered a growth of 22 per cent over the previous year. A notable feature of the Rupee Loan Programme of 1991 was the issue of short term Rupee Securities of one year's duration to meet the varying needs of investors. Gross borrowings through the floatation of Rupee securities during the year under review totalled Rs. 26,004 million with the Employee's Provident Fund (EPF) and the National Savings Bank (NSB) - the two principal captive sources-subscribing Rs. 13,363 million and Rs. 9,794 million, respec­tively. A further subscription of Rs. 1,500 million was made by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) in restoring its employee's provident fund balances under the restructuring programme. The contributions made to the Rupee Loan Programme by other provident funds and insurance institutions during the year amounted to Rs. 413 million. Meanwhile, repayments on account of Rupee loans during the year under review totalled Rs. 13,857 million, of which Rs. 956 million was met out of Sinking Fund balances.

Government debt on account of Treasury bills rose from Rs. 67,968 million in 1990 to Rs. 72,968 million in 1991 reflecting a new issue of Treasury bills to the tune of Rs. 5,000 million during the year. Meanwhile, Treasury bill holdings of the banking sector increased by 7 per cent to Rs. 44,271 million .while that of the non-bank sector also rose by a similar percentage point to Rs. 28,697 million. However, the inCTeased holdings of Treasury bills by the banking sector was almost entirely borne by the Central Bank with the outstanding liability on account of Treasury bills rising from Rs. 30,654 million in 1990 to Rs. 35,032 million in 1991.

Government borrowings through the Central Bank's Provisional Advances in 1991 amounted to Rs. 1,036 million registering a more than two-fold increase over the previ­ous year. Hence, the outstanding liability of this account rose from Rs. 6,408 million in 1990 to Rs. 7,444 million as at end of 1991.

Foreign Debt

The outstanding liability on foreign debt at the end of the year totalled Rs. 214,579 million - an increase of 21 per cent over the sum of Rs. 176,883 million recorded at the end of the previous year. This was the combined result of net foreign borrowings of Rs. 21,088 million and an increased liability of Rs. 16,608 million on account of ex­change rate variations. Foreign debt consisted of Rs. 202,555 million of concessional loans (94 per cent of the total) and Rs. 12,024 million of commercial loans. Bilateral loans at Rs. 124,471 million constituted 61 per cent of concessional loans, while multilat­eral loans at Rs. 78,084 million comprised the remaining 39 per cent.

The liability on account of Project loans rose by Rs.33,811 million to Rs. 166,149 million at the end of 1991 reflecting a net foreign borrowing of Rs. 20,985 million and an additional liability of Rs. 12,826 million on account of exchange rate variations. Gross foreign borrowings in the form of non-project loans during the year under review totalled Rs. 1,950 million while repayments on account of these loans amounted to Rs. 1,844 million. However, the total debt outstanding of these loans grew by Rs. 3,885 million due to an additional liability of Rs. 3,779 on account of exchange rate variations. The effect of exchange rati) variation on foreign debt is given in Table 1.54.

Total amortisation and interest payments on Government debt in 1991 at Rs. 39,855 million registered a growth of 21 per cent as compared to an increase of 38 per cent in 1990. Accordingly, debt service payments as a proportion of GDP rose marginally from 10.2 per cent in 1990 to 10.6 per cent in 1991. Total debt service payments on foreign debt at Rs. 8,994 million registered an increase of 5 per cent while such commitments on domestic debt at Rs. 30,861 million recorded a 27 per cent increase over the previous year.
