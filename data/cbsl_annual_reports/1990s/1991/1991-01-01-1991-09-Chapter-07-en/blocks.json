    "text": "The performance of the external trade sectorin 1991 was somewhat unfavourable with the trade account deteriorating considerably, due to both a sluggish growth in ex\u00adports and a large increase in imports. This was a reversal of the trend observed during the last three years when the trade deficit showed continuous improvement. The value of merchandise exports grew marginally by 2 per cent in SDR terms in 1991 as compared with an impressive growth of 20 per cent in 1990. Meanwhile, the outlay on imports rose by 13 per cent, compared with the 14 per cent growth observed in 1990. Accordingly, the trade deficit deteriorated by 48 per cent to SDR 747 million from SDR 519 million in",

Meanwhile, the average export price per nut equivalent increased by 29 per cent to SDR 0.09 per nut in 1991. There was a short-supply of coconut products in the world market due to a sharp decline in production in the Philip\u00adpines which is the major coconut exporter. However, the price increase was not sufficient to offset the adverse impact of the short-fall in the export volume, resulting in a reduction in earnings. The value of export earnings from coconut by-products also recorded a decline. The decrease was reflected in the exports of coir fibre bristles and coir fibre mattress.",

Wheat flour imports which recorded a more than seven-fold increase in 1990 dropped to a negligible level in 1991 mainly due to a decline in import volume, from 129 thousand metric tons in 1990 to 43 thousand metric tons in 1991. The drop in wheat flour imports was, however, partly offset by increased wheat grain imports for domestic milling. Although the volume of sugar imports in\u00adcreased by 53,108 metric tons, the expenditure on sugar imports dropped by 5 per cent, from SDR 95 million (Rs. 5,173 million) to SDR 91 million (Rs. 5,139 million) between the two years mainly due to lower international prices.",

The import outlay on petroleum, fertilizer and chemical products declined by 14 per cent, 21 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively in 1991 in contrast to increases of 46 per cent, 43 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively in 1990. The drop in expenditure on crude oil was the combined outcome of a decline in import volume by 153,344 metric tons and a drop in crude oil prices following the settlement of the Gulf crisis. The decline in import outlay on ferti\u00adlizer was largely explained by a decrease in the import volume by 146,082 metric tons during the year.",

    "text": "Tourist arrivals from all major regions, except Asia, recorded increases in 1991. As in the past, Western Europe continued to maintain its position as the leading market accounting for 60 per cent of the total arrivals compared with 57 per cent in the previous year. The tourist arrivals from Western Europe in 1991 at 192,054 recording an increase of 13 per cent over 1990. Increases in tourist arrivals were observed from all major Western European countries, except Austria, Spain and Italy which recorded decreases in arrivals. However, arrivals from the Asian market, the second largest, which was respon\u00adsible for 34 per cent of total arrivals in 1990 recorded a drop in it's share to 30 per cent in 1991. In contrast to the impressive growth of 53 per cent in 1990, the arrivals from Asia declined by 3 per cent in 1991 mainly due to decreases in arrivals from Hong Kong(70 per cent), Singapore (20 per cent), Thailand (13 per cent) and from Indonesia (11 per cent). Meanwhile, arrivals from Australasia and North America grew by 9 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. Arrivals from Eastern Europe recorded a significant decrease of 37 per cent during the year, reflecting the impact of political transformation and accom\u00adpanying economic problems in Eastern European countries. The gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism have been estimated at Rs. 6,463 million (SDR 114 million) in 1991 recording an increase of 26 per cent (23 per cent in SDR terms) over the earnings in the preceding year.",
