OVERALL TRENDS

Reflecting a major adjustment effort towards reducing persistently large fiscal deficit, the budgetary out-turn for 1992 marked a considerable improvement over 1991. Although the overall revenue effort was slightly weakened with a reduction in the revenue/GDP ratio from 20.4 per cent in 1991 to 20.3 per cent in 1992, a sharp fall in current expenditure from 22.5 per cent to 21.0 per cent of GDP was conducive for generating a lower current account deficit of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 1992 in comparison to 2.0 per cent in the previous year. Moreover, a reduction in public investment from 8.7 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 8.0 per cent in 1992, together with higher receipts from the privatisation programme, helped in containing the total expenditure/GDP ratio at 27.8 per cent in 1992 as against 32.1 per cent in the previous year. Accordingly, budgetary operations in 1992 resulted in a lower overall deficit of 7.4 per cent of GDP in comparison to 11.6 per cent in 1991 - a major contribution towards sustaining macro-economic stability.

A welcome feature in fiscal developments in 1992 was the further reduction in domestic borrowings by almost 1 percentage point to 3.7 per cent of GDP with such borrowings confined to non-bank sources. The lower domestic borrowing requirement also facilitated the Central Bank in reducing its holdings of Treasury bills through open market operations during the year. Accordingly, fiscal operations in 1992 together with Central Bank's open market operations were conducive to reducing net credit to government from the banking system by Rs. 2,321 million (0.5 per cent of GDP),

FISCAL OUT-TURN

Government revenue at Rs.86,118 million in 1992 registered an increase of 13 per cent over 1991. However, the overall revenue growth lagged behind the increase in nominal GDP resulting in a reduction in the revenue/GDP ratio to 20.3 per cent in 1992 from 20.4 per cent in 1991. In spite of an additional revenue effort through the imposition of defence levy and the expansion of excise taxes and enhanced revenue collections from income taxes and turnover taxes on imports, the tax revenue/GDP ratio fell from 18.3 per cent in 1991 to 18.1 per cent in 1992. This is attributed to a sharp fall in excise taxes on tobacco, dismal growth in turnover taxes on manufacturing and continued decline in export taxes.

Meanwhile, current expenditure totalling Rs. 88,726 million showed a moderate growth of 6 per cent in 1992 as compared to a rise of 17 per cent in 1991. Accordingly, the current expenditure/GDP ratio declined from 22.5 per cent to 21.0 per cent. Inspite of high defence expenditure amounting to Rs. 17,866 million (4.2 per cent of GDP), total current expenditure on the purchase of goods and services at Rs. 39,135 million registered only a 9 per cent growth in 1992 in comparison to a rise of 19 per cent in the previous year. Hence, these expenditures in relation to GDP declined to 9.2 per cent in 1992 from 9.6 per cent in 1991. Moreover, transfer payments declined from Rs. 25,835 million in 1991 to Rs. 24,308 million in 1992 due to a reduction in pension and refugee

121

expenses. Accordingly, total current transfers in relation to GDP declined to 5.7 per cent in 1992 from 7 per cent in 1991.

Underscoring the favourable trends in current expenditure components, the current account operations of the budget produced a considerably lower deficit of Rs. 2,608 million (0.6 per cent of GDP) in 1992 in comparison to a deficit of Rs. 7,577 million (2 per cent of GDP) in the previous year. Meanwhile, capital expenditure inclusive of on-lending to public enterprises at Rs. 34,027 million marked an increase of 4 per cent over 1991. However, the public investment/GDP ratio declined from 8.7 per cent to 8.0 per cent in 1992. In the meantime, higher receipts from the Privatisation Programme and enhanced receipts on account of loan repayments by public corporations to government were conducive towards reducing total expenditure and net lending from 32.1 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 27.8 per cent of GDP in 1992.

Fiscal operations in 1992 thus resulted in an overall budget deficit (before grants) of Rs. 31,509 million (7.4 per cent of GDP) - considerably lower than the deficit of Rs. 43,348 million (11.6 per cent of GDP) registered in 1991. With the use of foreign grants amounting to Rs. 8,280 million (2.0 per cent of GDP), the budget deficit (after grants) declined to Rs. 23,229 million (5.4 per cent of GDP) in 1992 from Rs. 35,478 million (9.5 per cent of GDP) in 1991. Meanwhile, the utilization of net foreign loans for budgetary purposes decreased from Rs. 19,329 million (5.2 per cent of GDP) to Rs. 7,984 million (1.9 per cent of GDP) due to a lower quantum of programme loans in 1992. However, the improved performance in current account operations together with lower capital expenditure and net lending due to higher privatisation proceeds enabled the government to contain net domestic borrowings at Rs. 15,246 million (3.6 per cent of GDP) in 1992 as compared to Rs. 16,148 million (4.3 per cent of GDP) in 1991. Thus, adhering to the policy of refraining from the use of resources from the banking system, domestic borrowings were raised almost exclusively from non-bank sources. A summary of government fiscal operations during 1988-1992 is given in Table 1.50.

REVENUE

Government revenue for 1992 at Rs. 86,118 million registered an increase of 13 per cent as compared to a 12 per cent growth in 1991. Tax revenue totalling Rs. 76,692 million accounted for 89 per cent of total revenue - almost the same level as in the previous year. Domestic taxes on goods and services continued to expand during the year generating 51 per cent of tax revenue as compared to 47 per cent in 1991. The increased importance of this source of revenue is attributed to the imposition of a defence levy in 1992 and the increase in the coverage of products under excise taxation. Meanwhile, taxes raised by way of import duties formed 27 per cent of total revenue as in 1991. Confirming the downward trend observed in recent years, the share of export taxes further declined to 1.1 per cent of total tax revenue in 1992. Inspite of a reduction in tax rates, the share of income taxes improved from 14.3 per cent in 1991 to 15.1 per cent in 1992.

Non-tax revenue at Rs. 9,425 million was an increase of 17 per cent over the previous year. Interest income rose by 35 per cent and accounted for 38 per cent of

non-tax revenue in 1992 in comparison to 33 per cent in 1991. Similarly, the transfer of Central Bank's profit at Rs. 1,150 million in 1992 was higher by Rs. 650 million. Meanwhile, revenue from non-industrial sales, administrative fees and regulatory charges reflecting a 53 per cent growth accounted for 27 per cent of non-tax revenue.

TAX REVENUE

Domestic taxes on goods and services consisting mainly of turnover taxes, excise duties, and the defence levy totalled Rs. 38,759 million registering a sharp rise of 21 per cent in 1992 in comparison to a growth of 12 per cent in the previous year. The imposition of the 1 per cent defence levy in January, 1992 and the enhancement of this rate to 3 per cent in May, 1992 were conducive to raising additional revenue during the year. The defence levy which is imposed on the turnover of manufacturers, importers and banking, insurance and other services brought in a revenue collection of Rs. 3,744 million or nearly 10 per cent of domestic taxes on goods and services in 1992.

Revenue from turnover taxes at Rs. 24,379 million marked a 14 per cent growth in 1992 largely due to a sharp rise in turnover taxes on imports. However, the revenue collection on account of turnover taxes on manufacturing at Rs. 8,233 million showed only a marginal increase of 4 per cent in 1992 in comparison to a much larger growth of 28 per cent in the previous year. The lacklustre performance of manufacturing turnover taxes was attributed largely to the reduced tax collection from the food, beverages and tobacco sub-category which registered only a 2 per cent increase over 1991. Keeping in line with a 14 per cent growth in overall imports and a higher revenue collection from import duties, revenue from the turnover tax on imports at Rs. 12,600 million showed a growth of 20 per cent over 1991. The increase in the standard turnover tax rate from 15 per cent to 20 per cent in November, 1992 also contributed towards augmenting revenue from this source during the year under review. Meanwhile, the turnover tax rate structure which was rationalised with four rate bands in May, 1992 was further simplified in November, 1992 by eliminating the 15 per cent rate band. Consequently, most essential items were classified under 5 and 10 per cent rate bands while non-essential items such as liquor, tobacco, beverages, petrol and consumer durables were brought under the standard rate of 20 per cent.

Meanwhile, inspite of a reduction in the turnover tax rate on banks from 3 per cent to 2 per cent, turnover taxes on non-manufacturing activities at Rs. 3,546 million marked a sharp increase of 19 per cent in 1992. This was partly due to a shift in the turnover tax rate on telecommunication services from 10 per cent to 20 per cent and partly to improved revenue collections from port and electricity services.

Revenue from excise taxes totalling Rs. 10,583 million in 1992 reflected a virtual stagnation in revenue collection owing to lower receipts on account of cigarette and tobacco taxes. Inspite of an increase in excise duty on cigarettes by Rs. 0.10 per cigarette in February, 1992 and a further Rs. 0.50 in October, 1992, revenue from this source showed a 19 per cent decline partly due to a reduction in the volume of sales and partly to a shortfall in the production of processed tobacco resulting from the drought conditions that prevailed in 1992. Meanwhile, reflecting the revisions to the excise duty rate on liquor by Rs. 5 per bottle in February, 1992 and a further Rs. 7 per bottle in July, 1992 revenue from liquor taxes at Rs. 3,803 million registered a rise of 22 per cent over the

125

previous year. Moreover, with the expansion in the coverage of products to include items such as aerated water, cement, tyres and tubes, electrical appliances, etc. under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act from February, 1992, revenue from this source increased by more than two-fold reaching Rs. 1,225 million in 1992.

As in the previous year, revenue from international trade oriented taxes in the form of import and export taxes generated nearly one-third of the total tax revenue collection in 1992. With the full year's impact of the four band tariff structure being felt in 1992, the import duty collection at Rs. 20,721 million registered an increase of 11 per cent over

1991. Thus, in spite of adjustments made under the four band tariff schedule and the duty waivers granted for wheat and several other products, the average incidence of import duties fell only marginally from 14.7 per cent in 1991 to 14.3 per cent in 1992.

In the context of continued reductions in export duties, low output and depressed prices, revenue from export taxes totalling Rs.817 million showed a further decline of 28 per cent during the year under review in comparison to a reduction of 55 per cent in the previous year. Revenue from the ad-valorem tax and specific duty on tea together amounting to Rs. 358 million marked a drop of 27 per cent reflecting the combined effect of depressed prices, lower export volume and reduced tax rates in 1992. Similarly, revenue from export duty on rubber at Rs. 317 million fell short of the revenue collection of Rs. 476 million in the previous year due to an increase in the tax free threshold price, a reduction in the tax rate and lower volume of exports. Meanwhile, with the increase in the tax-free threshold for coconut oil, reduction in the duty rates on copra and desiccated coconut, export duty on coconut at Rs.117 million also recorded a marginal decline of 8 per cent over 1991. Thus, overall revenue from export taxes in 1992 registered a decline of nearly 30 per cent over 1991. Meanwhile, with a view to providing a further boost to exporters by way of enhanced producer margins, the government removed export taxes including the ad-valorem sales tax on tea in December, 1992.

In the wake of continued reforms in income taxation viz-a-viz the reduction in the marginal tax rates, increase in threshold income, higher tax credits on employment income and the withdrawal of qualifying payments, revenue from income taxes in 1992 at Rs. 11,561 million registered a growth of 19 per cent keeping in line with the nominal growth in GDP. Inspite of a reduction in the maximum marginal rate of tax to 35 per cent, increase in the tax-free threshold income to Rs. 42,000 and a higher provision of Rs. 1,800 as tax credit for employment income, the personal income tax collection in 1992 at Rs. 4,454 million witnessed a growth of 26 per cent. This was mainly due to an enhanced revenue collection from non-employment income. Despite the reduction in the rate of withholding tax on interest income from 20 per cent in 1991 to 15 per cent in

1992, withholding taxes generated a higher collection due to a sustained increase in savings and fixed deposits in banking institutions. Moreover, revenue from corporate income taxes further rose to Rs. 7,107 million despite a five percentage point reduction in the tax rate to 40 per cent in April, 1992. This was due to the cessation of tax holiday status under Section 20-A of the Inland Revenue Act for a large number of companies and higher corporate profits during the year under review.

Meanwhile, reflecting the rate reduction in stamp duty on Letters of Credit from 2.5 per cent to 2 per cent in 1992 and the abolition of the wealth tax during the year under review, revenue from stamp duties and property transfers declined from Rs. 3,541 million

126

in 1991 to Rs. 2,845 million in 1992. A statistical summary of Government revenue is given in Table 1.51.

FOREIGN GRANTS

The utilisation of foreign grants for budgetary purposes during 1992 at Rs. 8,280 million registered a marginal growth of 5 per cent. Consequently, total foreign grants in relation to GDP dipped from 2.1 per cent in 1991 to 2.0 per cent in 1992. Foreign grants utilised by way of project grants at Rs. 6,002 million was an increase of 16 per cent over the quantum recorded during the last year. Meanwhile, commodity and food aid grants totalling Rs. 2,278 million showed a decline of 15 per cent in 1992 as against a two fold rise in the previous year. Japan and the U.S.A. continued to be the largest donors providing nearly 70 per cent of total outright grants to Sri Lanka. Grants provided by Japan and the U.S.A. during 1992 amounted to Rs. 2,817 million and Rs. 1,336 million, respectively.

EXPENDITURE

Total expenditure at Rs.l 17,627 million in 1992 recorded a marginal decline of 2 per cent over 1991. Current expenditure at Rs. 88,726 million accounted for 75 per cent of total expenditure while the balance 25 per cent comprised capital expenditure and net lending. Current outlays on purchase of goods and services formed 44 per cent of current expenditure while interest payments accounted for 28 per cent. Meanwhile, public investment in 1992 totalled Rs. 32,816 million as compared to Rs. 32,590 million in the previous year. Major investment activities were concentrated in areas such as roads, water supply and drainage, irrigation, land development, education and health.

CURRENT EXPENDITURE

Current expenditure at Rs. 88,726 million registering a moderate increase of 6 pet cent over 1991 accounted for 75 per cent of total expenditure in 1992 as compared to 70 per cent in previous year. Expenditure on account of purchase of goods and services in the form of salaries and wages and other goods and services at Rs. 39,007 million formed the bulk of current expenditure. Outlays on account of interest payments at Rs. 25,283 million in 1992 witnessed a sharp rise of 15 per cent over 1991 increasing its share in current expenditure from 26 per cent in 1991 to 28 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile, transfers to households and selected public corporations and other institutions at Rs. 24,436 million in 1992 reflected a drop of 5 per cent. Accordingly, the share of such outlays in current expenditure declined from 31 per cent in 1991 to 28 per cent in 1992.

Salaries and wages at Rs. 20,246 million marked an increase of 13 per cent over tne expenditure outlay of Rs. 17,985 million in the previous year. As a percentage of total current expenditure, salaries and wages increased marginally from 21 per cent in 1991 to 23 per cent in 1992. This was mainly due to higher expenditure incurred on personal emoluments for defence personnel which marked a 20 per cent rise from Rs. 6,376 million in 1991 to Rs.7,620 million in 1992. Meanwhile, reflecting stringent measures taken to contain current expenditure and tight cash management, expenses incurred by the government in procuring various goods and services including electricity, communication and supplies and requisites amounted to Rs. 18,762 million in 1992.

In 1991, a total sum of Rs. 17,847 million was spent on such outlays. However, expendi­ture on goods and services as a ratio of GDP was contained at 4.3 per cent in 1992 in comparison to 4.7 per cent in 1991.

Expenditure on account of interest payments at Rs. 25,283 million rose by 15 per cent over 1991. Interest payments on domestic debt increased from Rs. 17,960 million in

1991 to Rs. 20,597 million in 1992. With interest rates varying in a range of 15 - 17 per cent per annum and a rise in the outstanding liabilities by 16 per cent, interest on medium and long term domestic debt at Rs. 9,242 million registered a rise of 21 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile, interest payments on account of Treasury bills at Rs. 11,355 million reflected a growth of 9 per cent owing to an increased volume of Treasury bills outstanding and a generally high level of yields which rose from a range of 16.33-17.43 per cent per annum in 1991 to 17.67-18.99 per cent per annum in 1992. Moreover, expenditure on foreign interest payments at Rs. 4,686 million witnessed an increase of 14 per cent in comparison to a rise of 12 per cent in 1991. The average interest rate on foreign debt at 2.2 per cent in

1992 continued to reflect the concessionary nature of foreign borrowings undertaken by Sri Lanka.

During the year under review, transfer payments amounting to Rs..24,436 million witnessed a drop of 5 per cent. As a percentage of GDP, such expenditures declined from 7 per cent in 1991 to 5.6 per cent in 1992. This was attributed mainly to a reduction in pension payments by Rs. 791 million and reduced expenditure outlays on miscellaneous welfare expenditure programmes by Rs. 843 million. With increased thrust of govern­ment policy on commercialisation of public enterprises, transfers to such entities inclusive of railways and postal which in 1991 amounted to Rs. 2,009 million declined to Rs. 1,670 million in 1992. Pension payments which doubled in 1991 due to the implementation of the retrenchment programme for government employees in 1990 settled at a slightly lower level of Rs.8,041 million in 1992 with the number of pensioners totalling 291,000. Meanwhile, outlays on account of special welfare programmes comprising food and kerosene stamps, Mid-Day-Meal and the Janasaviya at Rs. 8,306 million recorded a growth of 6 per cent due to enhanced expenditure on Janasaviya and the Mid-Day-Meal Programme. Moreover, a sum of Rs. 600 million was spent in 1992 for the provision of free uniforms for school children further augmenting overall welfare expenditure in the budget. Thus, expenditure on these special welfare programmes accounted for 2 per cent of GDP in 1992. Expenditure on other household transfers inclusive of about Rs. 1,800 million for refugee expenses amounted to Rs. 3,345 million.

On a functional basis, current expenditures incurred for the provision of social services such as education, health, welfare programmes at Rs.29,003 million declined from 8.4 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 6.6 per cent of GDP in 1992. Expenditure on education at Rs. 7,657 million rose by 12 per cent over the previous year while outlays directed to the health sector increased from Rs. 4,110 million in 1991 to Rs. 4,571 million in 1992. However, total welfare expenditure at Rs. 16,620 million declined to 4 per cent of GDP in 1992 from 5 per cent in 1991. Meanwhile, current expenditures routed for economic services such as agriculture and irrigation, fisheries, energy and water supply, transport, communications, etc. were maintained more or less at the same GDP ratio of 1 per cent as in 1991. However, current expenditure channelled for general public services such as civil administration, public order and safety and defence although increased in absolute terms from Rs. 19,811 million in 1991 to Rs. 21,251 million in 1992 declined in relation to GDP from 5.3 per cent to 4.9 per cent between the two years.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND NET LENDING

Capital expenditure and net lending in 1992 totalled Rs. 28,901 million. This consisted of Rs. 34,027 million on account of public investment and a reduction in government liabilities to the tune of Rs. 5,126 million largely due to proceeds from privatisation and loan repayments by public corporations. In terms of the public investment programme, capital expenditure directly incurred by Ministries and Departments for the construction and development of fixed assets totalled Rs. 15,426 million in comparison to Rs. 14,888 million in the previous year. A sum of Rs. 4,126 million was channelled through the Ministries of Education and Health for the development of capital assets in such services. Total capital expenditure incurred on various development projects by the Ministries of Public Administration and Policy Planning amounted to Rs. 3,015 million.

Moreover, capital transfers provided for statutory boards and public corporations engaged in the implementation of projects under the public investment programme amounted to Rs. 12,363 million in comparison to Rs. 9,830 million in 1991. Of these capital transfers, a sum of Rs. 8,858 million was utilised in major public investment projects implemented by the Road Development Authority (Rs. 2,998 million), National Water Supply and Drainage Boards (Rs. 2,769 million), Mahaweli Development Authority (Rs. 2,293 million) and the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (Rs. 798 million).

Capital expenditure incurred by public corporations from funds mobilised by way of government on-lending amounted to Rs. 5,487 million - considerably lower than the amount anticipated in the 1992 budget estimates. The investments by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) amounted to Rs. 2,341 million as against a budgetary provision of Rs. 3,610 million due to the delayed implementation of various power projects. Similarly, investment by Sri Lanka Telecom amounted to Rs. 1,572 million - almost half the investment envisaged for 1992. On-lending to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) at Rs. 848 million for the development of port facilities also registered a decline of 25 per cent over the amount earmarked in the 1992 budget. Meanwhile, repayments on account of funds on-lent by the government totalled Rs. 2,633 million in comparison to Rs. 1,132 million in the previous year. Repayments by the CEB amounting to Rs. 1,043 million constituted nearly 40 per cent of the total.

During the year under review, the privatisation of public enterprises generated Rs. 3,115 million as compared to Rs. 841 million in the previous year. The enterprises which were divested during the year include the Asian Hotels Corporations Limited, Ceylon Oils and Fats Limited, Kelani Tyres Limited, Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka Limited, Veyangoda Textile Mills Limited and Lanka synthetic Fibre Company Limited. Meanwhile, the restructuring costs incurred by the government in terms of the on-going structural adjustment in the public sector amounted to Rs. 750 million - considerably lower than Rs. 3,355 million incurred in the previous year. Hence, privatisation proceeds net of restructuring cost in 1992 was Rs. 2,365 million - a positive contribution to contain a lower government deficit in 1992. An economic classification of government expendi­ture is given in table 1.52.

According to a functional classification of capital expenditure and on-lending, total public investment for the development of economic infrastructure facilities amounted to

Rs. 24,589 million. The investment on economic infrastructure in relation to GDP was 5.6 per cent in 1992 in comparison to 6.9 per cent in 1991. Capital investment for the development of energy and water supply, transport and communications sub sectors continued to remain high absorbing nearly two-thirds of total public investment in economic infrastructure in 1992. Meanwhile, public investment for the provision of infrastructure facilities in education, health and other social services at Rs. 6,372 million showed two-fold increase over the previous year. Accordingly, as a proportion of GDP, such investment rose from 0.8 per cent in 1991 to 1.5 per cent in 1992. Total capital investment on general administration at Rs. 3,073 million represented 0.7 per cent of GDP as compared to 0.6 per cent in the previous year. A statistical summary of the functional classification of Government expenditure is presented in Table 1.53.

FINANCING OF THE BUDGET DEFICIT

The budget deficit (after grants) at Rs. 23,229 million in 1992 marked a sharp decline of Rs. 12,249 million over the deficit in 1991. In financing this deficit, a sum of Rs. 14,569 million was mobilised through concessionary foreign loans, of which Rs. 1,680 million was through programme loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in support of the on-going structural adjustment programme. However, after allowing for loan repayments totalling Rs. 6,577 million, net foreign borrowings for budgetary purposes during the year amounted to only Rs. 7,984 million -almost half the quantum utilised in the previous year. Accordingly, the share of such funding in total deficit financing declined from 56 per cent in 1991 to 34 per cent in 1992. The bulk of foreign loans mobilised during 1992 was in the form of project loans and the amount utilised was Rs. 12,889 million on a gross basis.

Gross borrowings for budgetary purposes from domestic sources through the issue of Rupee loans and Treasury bills and by way of administrative arrangements amounted to Rs. 35,690 million as compared to Rs. 33,390 million in the previous year. Of the total gross borrowings of Rs. 20,919 million mobilised by issuing rupee securities, a sum of Rs. 20,281 million was raised from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). However, with amortisation payments totalling Rs. 17,941 million, the net borrowings through Rupee loans in 1992 amounted to only Rs. 2,979 million as compared with Rs. 13,103 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, resources raised through the issue of Treasury bills amounted to Rs. 12,914 million. The National Savings Bank (NSB) investing Rs. 9,358 million became the major subscriber to Treasury bills in 1992. In financing the budget deficit, the government also utilised a sum of Rs. 1,857 million from the NSB through administrative arrangements. Accordingly, of the total net domestic borrowings of Rs. 15,302 million raised from non-bank sources, nearly 90 per cent was from the NSB and the EPF which had been traditional captive sources in subscribing to government paper.

Net borrowings from the banking system for financing the budget deficit witnessed a further decline in 1992. Inspite of the use of resources through the Central Bank Provisional Advances amounting to Rs. 1,484 million and a further sum of Rs. 6,362 million by running down government deposit balances, Net Credit to Government from the Central Bank declined by Rs. 1,894 million due to a sharp reduction in Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills by Rs. 8,062 million and a further reduction in cash items in the process of collection by Rs. 1,679 million. Meanwhile, inspite of the

increased holding of Treasury bills and government securities by commercial banks to the tune of Rs. 922 million, the overall net credit from commercial banks also declined by Rs. 427 million due to a build up of deposit balances and a reduction in the holdings of import bills as well as cash items in the process of collection. Accordingly, overall fiscal operations during 1992 resulted in a reduction in Net Credit to Government from the banking system by Rs. 2,321 million.

GOVERNMENT DEBT

Government debt at the end of 1992 at Rs. 404,863 million registered an increase of 10 per cent over the debt stock at the end of 1991. Domestic debt at Rs. 170,013 million constituting 42 per cent of total debt showed a 12 per cent rise. Reflecting the heavy reliance on Treasury bills to raise funds for financing the budget deficit, the short term debt at Rs. 97,924 million recorded a growth of 16 per cent. This was conducive to raising the share of short term debt to nearly 60 per cent of total domestic debt. The debt held by the non-bank sector at Rs. 111,543 million accounted for 66 per cent of domestic debt. Meanwhile, foreign debt at Rs. 234,850 million showed a moderate growth of 9 per cent in 1992 in comparison to a sharp increase of 21 per cent in the previous year. Project loans totalling Rs. 184,886 million accounted for nearly 80 per cent of foreign debt. A statistical summary of government debt is given in Table 1.54.

Domestic Debt

Domestic debt at Rs. 170,013 million was an increase of 12 per cent in 1992 as compared to a growth of 14 per cent in 1991. Short term debt (maturity of less than one year) at Rs. 97,924 million marked an increase of 16 per cent over 1991. With increased reliance on Treasury bills to raise funds for budgetary operations, the debt outstanding on account of Treasury bills at Rs. 87,096 million in 1992 reflected new issues to the tune of Rs. 14,128 million.

Treasury bill holdings of the banking sector rose by Rs. 4,487 million to Rs. 48,758 million at the end of 1992. This was entirely due to an increase in the holdings of commercial banks, from Rs. 9,239 million in 1991 to Rs. 22,760 million in 1992. Simultaneously, the Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank declined to Rs. 25,998 million in 1992 from Rs. 35,032 million in the previous year. Accordingly, total Treasury bill holdings of the banking system at the end of 1992 accounted for 56 per cent of total Treasury bills outstanding in comparison to 61 per cent an year ago. Meanwhile, the non-bank sector raised its stock of Treasury bills from Rs. 28,697 million in 1991 to Rs. 38,338 million in 1992 - an increase of Rs. 9,641 million during the year. The share of Treasury bills held by this sector thus rose from 39 per cent to 44 per cent. The National Savings Bank (NSB) with a total investment of Rs. 16,645 million remained the single largest subscriber to Treasury bills from the non-bank sector.

Despite an increase in the outstanding liability on account of Treasury bills by Rs. 14,128 million, short term debt raised through treasury bills rose by only Rs. 12,028 million due to the issue of long term Treasury bills during the year. However, with an increase in Central Bank's Provisional Advances by Rs. 1,484 million, the total short term debt rose by Rs. 13,421 million to Rs. 97,924 million at the end of 1992.

Medium and long term domestic debt at the end of 1992 stood at Rs. 72,096 million registering a growth of 7 per cent over 1991. This was the combined outcome of an increase of Rs. 2,356 million on account of Rupee Securities and a rise of Rs. 2,100 million in respect of Treasury bills. The issue of long term Treasury bills (maturity over 1 year) was commenced in 1992 with a view to promoting the market for long term debt instruments.

The outstanding debt on account of Rupee Securities at Rs. 69,180 million in 1992 registered a moderate increase of 4 per cent in comparison to a much higher growth of 22 per cent recorded in the previous year. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) continued to be the major subscriber to the Rupee Loan Programme raising its total investments in Rupee Securities from Rs. 42,607 million at the end of 1991 to Rs. 51,208 million at the end of 1992.

Foreign Debt

The outstanding foreign debt at Rs. 234,850 million marked an increase of Rs. 20,271 million or 9 per cent over the previous year. The rise in the foreign debt consisted of a net borrowing of Rs.7,984 million and an increase in the outstanding debt by Rs. 12,289 million due to exchange rate variations during the year. Concessional loans at Rs. 224,492 million accounted for 96 per cent of foreign debt as compared to 94 per cent at the end of 1991. Meanwhile, outstanding liabilities on commercial loans at Rs. 10,358 million reflected a 14 per cent reduction over 1991 and accounted for a mere 3 per cent of total foreign debt. Bilateral loans at Rs. 133,325 million constituted 59 per cent of concessional loans at end 1992 in comparison to 61 per cent at end 1991.

Liabilities on account of project loans at Rs. 184,886 million at the end of 1992 reflected a net borrowing of Rs. 8,878 million and an additional liability of Rs. 9,859 million on account of exchange rate variations. Meanwhile, the outstanding liability on account of non-project loans rose to Rs. 49,956 million from Rs. 48,430 million at end 1991 an increase of Rs. 1,526 million. The effect of exchange rate variations on foreign debt is given in Table 1.55.

GOVERNMENT DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS

Total debt service payments of the government consisting of amortisation and

interest payments amounted to Rs. 50,027 million in 1992 - an increase of 26 per cent

over 1991. Accordingly, debt service payments as a ratio of GDP reached 11.8 per cent in

1992 as compared to 10.6 per cent in 1991. Amortisation payments at Rs. 24,708 million

constituted 49 per cent of the total debt service commitment, while interest payments at

Rs. 25,319 million comprised the balance. With a large volume of medium and long term

loans reaching maturity in 1992, amortisation payments on account of domestic debt

totalled Rs. 18,123 million - an increase of 40 per cent over 1991. Meanwhile, such

payments on account of foreign debt rose from Rs. 4,881 million in 1991 to Rs. 6,585

million in 1992. Reflecting higher rates of interest and an increased volume of short term

domestic debt, interest payments on such debt at Rs. 11,355 million marked an increase

of 9 per cent. Similarly, with the prevalence of higher interest rates on medium and long

term debt, and a further rise in the stock of such debt, interest payments at Rs. 9,278

million showed an increase of 23 per cent. Meanwhile, interest payments on foreign loans

rose by 14 per cent to Rs. 4,686 million in 1992. A statistical summary of Government
