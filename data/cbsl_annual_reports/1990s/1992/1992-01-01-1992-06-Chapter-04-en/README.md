INDUSTRY

OVERALL PERFORMANCE

The industrial sector continued to maintain its growth momentum recording higher levels of production and exports in 1992. The value of industrial output which grew by 10 per cent in real terms in 1991, expanded by 12 per cent in 1992. This growth originated entirely from private sector industry. The output of private sector industry increased by 20 per cent in real terms, the highest rate of growth recorded since 1985. In contrast, the output of the public sector industry declined by 19 per cent.

In the private sector, the industrial sub-sectors which recorded large increases in production were textile and wearing apparel; chemicals, rubber and plastic; non-metallic minerals and paper and paper products. The substantial decline in public sector industrial output in 1992 was mainly due to the privatisation of a number of important public sector industries and a sharp decline in the output of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

The value of industrial exports increased from Rs. 50,736 million in 1991 to Rs. 75,776 million in 1992. The share of textile and wearing apparel in total industrial exports increased from 66 per cent in 1991 to 69 per cent in 1992.

INDUSTRIAL POLICY

The status of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) was elevated to a Board of Investment in November, 1992 with an increased responsibility of extending the promotional and facilitative activities in respect of both foreign and domestic investments from limited zones or areas to the whole country. A new incentive package was intro­duced in February, 1992 with a view to attracting investments and generating employ­ment opportunities in less developed areas. A scheme for establishing 200 export oriented garment factories in Pradeshiya Sabha Divisions was initiated in 1992. Under the Indus­trial Promotion Act of 1990, seven Regional Industry Service Committees were set up in March, 1992 in order to promote, facilitate and co-ordinate industrial and related activi­ties in the provinces.

In. response to tax concessions granted for industries of a pioneering nature, 86 new industries and 174 existing industries with expanded capacities commenced operations by December, 1992. Tax concessions were also granted for the establishment of private industrial estates, of which 2 have got off the ground in 1992.

In keeping with government policy on privatisation, approval was given by the Cabinet for the conversion of a number of public sector industries into limited liability companies during 1992. These included the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation, Sri Lanka Cement Corporation, Lubricant Plant of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Colombo Gas Co. Ltd., Lanka Phosphate Ltd., National Paper Corporation and the Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation. The majority of shares of the Ceylon Oils & Eats Ltd., Nylon 6 Plant of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Kelani Tyres Ltd., Veyangoda Textile Mills Ltd., Lanka Ceramic Ltd. and Kahatagaha Graphite Ltd. were sold through Cabinet Appointed Tender Boards to the value of Rs. 81 million, Rs. 228 million, Rs. 400 million, Rs. 270 million, Rs. 112 million and Rs. 16 million respectively during 1992. The majority or balance shares of the Pugoda Textile Mills Ltd., Lanka Oxygen Ltd. and the Distilleries

54

Company of Sri Lanka Ltd. were sold through the Colombo Stock Exchange on "all-or-nothing basis" to the value of Rs. 1.06 million, Rs. 0.62 million and Rs. 1,053 million respectively. In addition, shares valued at Rs.495 million and Rs. 112 million of the Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka Ltd. and Bogala Graphite Ltd. respectively were offered to the public during the first half of the year.

PRODUCTION

In real terms, the value of industrial output is estimated to have increased by 12 per cent in 1992. When the value of petroleum output is excluded the estimated expansion in industrial production was 16 per cent.

Industrial sub-sectors that recorded increases in production in 1992 were: textile,

wearing apparel and leather products (31 per cent); non-metallic mineral products (20 per

cent); wood and wood products (15 per cent); paper and paper products and basic metal

products (14 per cent each); fabricated metal products (9 per cent) and food, beverages

and tobacco (1 per cent). The only sector which recorded a decrease in output was

chemicals, petroleum and plastic products (5 per cent).

The overall production in private sector industries recorded an increase of 20 per

cent in 1992 compared to a 14 per cent growth in the previous year. This growth origi­

nated largely from three product categories viz. textile, wearing apparel and leather;

chemicals, rubber and plastic products and non-metallic mineral products.

Almost the entire output of the textile, wearing apparel and leather products sub-sector was contributed by private sector industries. The privatisation of three textile mills and a leather manufacturing unit also contributed to this development. The substan­tial increase in the output of the textile, wearing apparel and leather products category was primarily a result of a rapid expansion of the export oriented garment industry, both within and outside the investment promotion zones and improved performance of the medium and small scale garment industry catering to the domestic market. A rapid expansion of non-quota garment exports particularly to the European Economic Commu­nity (EEC) which accounted for 35 per cent of the total garment exports of Sri Lanka was a noteworthy feature in this sector during 1992.

Private sector industries which contributed more than 80 per cent of the total output

in the non-metallic mineral products sub-sector registered improved performance in

1992. Increased output levels were recorded in private sector industries engaged in the

manufacture of ceramics, cement, asbestos and cutting and polishing of gems and

diamond. Manufacture of glass and glass products, however, recorded a decline in output.

The share of private sector has increased to nearly a half of the total output of the

chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products sub-sector with the transfer of

ownership of the Tyre Corporation and the decline in the output of public sector indus­

tries in this category in 1992. Increased output levels were also recorded in the private

sector industries engaged in the manufacture of rubber and plastic products, soap, cos­

metics, paints and varnishers, agro-chemicals and fertilizer.

The increase in output in the fabricated metal products sector was entirely due to

improved performance of the private sector industries engaged in the manufacture of

machinery and equipment, cables and-electrical appliances and fabricated metal. In the paper and paper products category, two-thirds of the total output was contributed by the private sector industries. Increased output levels were recorded in private sector indus­tries engaged in printing and manufacture of labels, cartons and envelopes.

In the food, beverages and tobacco sub-sector, the private sector industries recorded poor production performance in 1992. This was partly due to the prolonged drought that prevailed during the early part of the year. The reduced expansion of the output of private sector industries was largely due to the decline in production of tobacco, sugar, liquor and dairy products. Industries which manufacture meat products, biscuits, flour and confec­tionery showed an improved performance.

The value of overall industrial production, in current terms, is estimated to have increased by 23 per cent in 1992. The value of textile, wearing apparel and leather rose by 45 per cent; wood and wood products by 25 per cent; non-metallic mineral products by 21 per cent; fabricated metal products and paper and paper products by 17 per cent (each); food, beverages and tobacco by 14 per cent; basic metal products and products (n.e.s.) by 12 per cent (each).

PUBLIC SECTOR INDUSTRIES

In real terms, the public sector industrial output decreased by 19 per cent in 1992, compared with 8 per cent decline in the previous year. The sharp decrease in the public sector industrial output in 1992 was a combined result of the privatisation of a number of important public sector industrial enterprises and a substantial decrease in output of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) which accounted for 65 per cent of the total public sector industrial output. When petroleum is excluded, the output of public sector indus­trial enterprises declined by 22 per cent.

The public sector industrial enterprises which recorded decreases in output were: State Rubber Manufacturing (40 per cent), Ceylon Petroleum (18 per cent), Ceylon Mineral Sands (34.per cent) and Lanka Ceramics (3 per cent).

The substantial decline in output of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was mainly due to the closure of its refinery for 14 weeks in the second half of 1992 on account of a major modification to the crude distiller unit. The adverse weather conditions that prevailed during the year resulted in a decrease in output of the Sri Lanka Rubber Manufacturing Company Ltd. The decline in output of the Ceylon Mineral Sands Co. was mainly due to a short supply of sands on account of the adverse security conditions in the region.

The public sector industrial enterprises that recorded production increases during the year were: Lanka Salt (159 per cent), State Timber (66 per cent), National Paper (14 per cent), Ceylon Steel (13 per cent) and Sri Lanka Cement (5 per cent). •

The substantial increase in the output of the State Timber Corporation was mainly due to an increase in the demand for sleepers, transmission poles and sawn timber during the year. The improved performance of both the Embilipitiya and Valachchenai Mills resulted in the increased production of the National Paper Corporation. Increased output level of the Lanka Salt Company Ltd. was a result of favourable weather conditions that prevailed during the year. The adequate supply of raw materials throughout the year was reflected in the improved output levels of the Ceylon Steel Corporation.

In terms of sectoral classification of public enterprises, the wood and wood products sector recorded the highest growth (66 per cent) in 1992. The other sectors that recorded increased levels of output were: paper and paper products (14 per cent) and basic metal products (13 per cent). The sectors that recorded decreases in output were: food; bever­ages and tobacco (26 per cent); chemical products (22 per cent) and non-metallic mineral products (1 per cent).

61

The DFCC approved 331 projects with an outlay of Rs. 2,577 million for the indus­trial sector by way of loans and equity participation. The industrial categories that received the major share of this assistance were: food, beverages and tobacco; rubber and plastic products; textile, wearing apparel and leather products and fabricated metal products.

During 1992 the commercial banks too continued to provide financial assistance to industries. Commercial bank advances to the industrial sector during the first nine months of the year increased by 7 per cent from Rs. 13,483 million to Rs. 14,441 million as at end of September, 1992.

PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT

The-Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) which-functions as "One-Stop Invest­ment Promotion Centre" continued to provide a wide range of incentives and concessions under W o incentive schemes. The BOI approved 291 projects in 1992, under Section 17 of the GCEC Law (special incentive scheme) bringing the total number of projects approved to 702 by the end of 1992. Of these, agreements had been signed in respect of 398 projects with the BOI to set up various industries. A total of 211 enterprises were in commercial operation as at end of 1992. Of those in production, 79 were in Katunayake Investment Promotion Zone (KTPZ), 38 in Biyagama Investment Promotion Zone (BIPZ), 8 in Koggala Investment Promotion Zone (KglPZ) and 86 in other parts of the country.

In 1992, the employment in BOI enterprises increased by 22 per cent, bringing the total number in employment in these enterprises to 104,220 persons. Of these, 65,465 or 63 per cent were engaged in the textile, wearing apparel and leather product sector. The relative share of employment in the non-garment sector increased from 37 per cent in 1991 to 40 per cent of total employment in BOI enterprises in 1992. Chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber and plastic products; paper and paper products and food, beverages and tobacco products were among the industrial categories which recorded the highest rate of employment generation.

The total envisaged investment of projects approved in 1992 was Rs. 17,610 million. Foreign investors came from a number of countries such as Japan, Korea, Singapore, Hongkong, Italy, Taiwan, Malaysia, Germany, Pakistan, Bermuda, Netherlands and Dubai. The projects approved by the BOI in 1992 included the manufacture of Ayurvedic drugs, picture frames, motor spare parts, rubber products, non-cotton fabrics, coir briquettes, false eye lashes, stuffed toys, gem studded jewellery, footwear, paper products, electrical appliances, tobacco products and cutting and polishing of diamonds.

The BOI has also approved 78 projects in 1992, under the Inland Revenue Act and the Tax Related Laws (general incentives scheme). The total envisaged investment in these projects amounted to Rs. 1,766 million, of which the foreign component was Rs. 863 million and the local component Rs.903 million. The employment potential of these enterprises was 6,417 persons.

Gross exports earnings of BOI enterprises were Rs. 43,264 million (SDR 701 million) in 1992 showing an increase of 96 per cent over the previous year. In SDR terms, the increase was 79 per cent. Export earnings from textile and ready-made garments were 84 per cent higher than the previous year's level and continued to be the major foreign exchange earner, accounting 62 per cent of the total export earnings of BOI

62

enterprises. Export earnings per employee in the textile and garment sector stood at Rs. 407,683 as compared with Rs. 267,108 in the previous year. The value of exports of non-garments enterprises increased by 118 per cent during the year under review.
