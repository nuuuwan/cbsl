In contrast to the high levels that pre\u00advailed since mid-1990, the annual rate of growth of Narrow Money Supply (M t) regis\u00adtered a declining trend since July, 1992 reaching 7.3 per cent at the end of the year. This compared to an 18 per cent growth at the end of 1991. Underscoring this slowing down, the monthly average increase in Mt also declined from 13.6 per cent in 1991 to 12.1 per cent in 1992. Reflecting a similar trend, the annual increase in the Broad Money Supply (M 2) declined to 16.6 per cent as at end-1992 from 23.2 per cent an year ago. However, in spite of this deceleration, the monthly average growth in M 2 rose to 21.3 per cent in 1992 from 19 per cent in 1991.",

This was around half the quantum witnessed in the previous year. On the source side, this expansion was entirely accounted for by a build-up of net foreign assets (NFA) of the Central Bank amounting to Rs. 7,563 million. However, a reduction in the net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central Bank by Rs. 2,760 million largely due to open market operations, moderated the rate of growth of reserve money during the year. The money multiplier - the ratio between money supply and the monetary base - stood at 2.91 in December, 1992 as against 2.80 an year ago. This shift is partly a reflection of a reduction in the currency deposit ratio from 28 per cent in 1991 to 26 per cent in 1992.",

    "text": "The high levels of monetary and credit expansion compelled the Central Bank to continue with a tight monetary policy stance during 1992. Accordingly, while maintain\u00ading Bank Rate at 17 per cent the Central Bank refinance rates were revised upward on several occasions to bring them in line with market rates of interest. Monetary policy was also directed at siphoning-off excess liquidity in the economy through active open market operations. Meanwhile, the thrust of monetary policy was more on indirect controls and the reliance on direct controls was reduced by removing deposit margins on Letters of Credit which had been in place since June, 1989. This policy stance in the context of continuing high demand for credit was conducive to maintaining short term interest rates at relatively high levels throughout 1992.",

The increase in quasi-money was due to a build-up of time and savings deposits of private sector constituents by 26 per cent (Rs. 14,315 million) during the year. In the previous year, such deposits rose by 22 per cent (Rs. 10,243 million). At the same time, time and savings deposits held by co-operative institutions grew by 56 per cent (Rs. 971 million) during the same period. However, such deposits of government corporations declined marginally by 2 per cent (Rs. 118 million) during 1992 in contrast to a sharp rise of 61 per cent (Rs. 2,845 million) in the previous year. The considerable liquidity creation through the build up of external banking assets and the high positive real interest rates offered were conducive for the continued high growth of time and savings deposits with commercial banks during the year. Reflecting these developments, the Broad Money Supply (M 2), consisting of M, plus time and savings deposits held by the public, expanded by 16.6 per cent (Rs. 18,604 million) in 1992, in comparison to a growth of 23 per cent (Rs. 21,080 million) in the previous year. Moreover, the share of quasi-money in M 2 rose from 58 per cent to 61 per cent between the two years. The improvement in the relative share of quasi-money in monetary aggregates reflected the public's preference to hold interest bearing assets in their investment portfolios.",

Meanwhile, in contrast to a substantial increase of Rs. 2,663 million in 1991, bank credit to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) declined by Rs. 1,183 million in 1992 hiainly due to enhanced revenue resulting from price revisions of selected petroleum products. The credit requirements of the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) also showed a decline of Rs.'784 million during the year due to improved cash position brought about by the grant of a duty waiver on wheat grain imports. Meanwhile, during the first six months of the year, bank credit to the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) and the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) expanded by Rs. 865 millidn and Rs. 605 million, respectively.

On the other hand, foreign currency deposit liabilities of commercial banks rose to Rs. 20,452 million recording an increase of Rs. 5,638 million. This was the outcome of a large inflow of foreign currency deposits through Non-Resident Foreign Currency Accounts (NRFC) which rose by 37 per cent (Rs. 4,902 million) in 1992. These developments were conducive to sustaining a favourable overall position in the balance of payments in 1992.",

Accordingly, the ratio of liquid assets to demand deposits moved up further from 160 per cent in 1991 to 166.6 per cent in 1992 indicating an improved liquidity position in commercial banks. The increase in liquid assets was more pronounced in foreign balances which rose by Rs. 4,280 million.

The total assets/liabilities of commercial banks (excluding contra items) rose by 19 per cent (Rs. 29,147 million) in 1992 in comparison to an increase of 17 per cent (Rs. 22,997 million) in the preceding year. On the liabilities side, changes in all major categories contributed to enlarge the resource base of commercial banks during the year. However, a 20 per cent (Rs. 21,597 million) growth in deposits continued to provide the main impetus to the resource build-up accounting for 75 per cent of the total resources of commercial banks during the year. This was reflected in both time and savings deposits as well as demand deposits but the larger increase of 25 per eent (Rs. 19,817 million) in the former accounted for the overwhelmingly large share. This reflected the positive impact of high interest rates on savings mobilization and a continuous influx of liquidity through enhanced foreign inflows. Meanwhile, other liabilities moved up by 19 per cent (Rs. 5,506 million) while total borrowings consisting of inter-bank borrowings (including the Central Bank) and foreign borrowings registered an increase of 13 per cent (Rs. 1,135 million) in 1992.",

Moreover, total credit provided under overdraft facilities increased by 36 per cent (Rs. 10,429 million). However, cash items in the process of collection declined by 24 per cent (Rs. 1,084 million). Meanwhile, despite a decrease in import bills purchased and discounted by 32 per cent (Rs. 1,431 million), total liquid assets comprising cash on hand, deposits with the Central Bank, foreign balances, Treasury bills and bills discounted expanded by 10 per cent (Rs. 4,749 million) during 1992. Of this increase, Treasury bill holdings accounted for Rs. 754 million and foreign balances for Rs. 4,280 million. In line with increased deposit liabili\u00adties of commercial banks, statutory reserves held with the Central Bank also rose by Rs. 1,899 million.",

As in the previous year, the majority of advances granted for industrial purposes fell into the short-term category. However, the share of short term industrial advances in total indus\u00adtrial loans declined from 73 per cent to 70 per cent. Advances granted to government corporations for other industrial purposes declined by Rs. 1,651 million in 1992 in com\u00adparison to a decrease of Rs. 773 million in the previous year. This was mainly reflected in chemicals, petroleum and coal, wearing apparels and leather industries and basic metal products sub-sectors. However, industrial advances granted to the private sector rose by Rs. 1,831 million to Rs. 11,931 million, in comparision to an increase of Rs. 1,813 million in the preceding year. The other categories which recorded increases during the period under review were food, beverages and tobacco (Rs. 583 million), non-metallic mineral products (Rs. 63 million), chemicals, petroleum and coal (Rs. 176 million), textiles (Rs. 282 million) and fabricated metal products (Rs. 144 million).",

The main reason for the decrease in the value of loans disbursed in 1992 was the adverse effect of pie drought that prevailed in major cultivation areas. The decrease in the value of loans granted was reflected in a corresponding drop in the number of loans granted, from 83,001 in 1991 to 62,355 in 1992. This was a decrease of 25 per cent: The major share of loans granted under NCRCS was for the cultivation of paddy which accounted for around 71 per cent of the total. The rest was granted for the cultivation of subsidiary crops.",

Meanwhile, the improved liquidity position of commercial banks resulted in a depressed demand for call money leading to a reduction in the turnover of inter-bank call money market.

The improved liquidity position of commercial banks was conducive for a generally reduced demand for call money during the year. However, demand for call money rose during the fourth quarter following the liquidity constraint created by the extension of the reserve requirement to cover foreign currency deposits of commercial banks in September, 1992. Thus, the call money market rates which narrowed from a range of 13 - 27 per cent at end-1991 to 15 - 19 per cent in August, 1992, widened again to 10 - 32 by the end of the year.",

In spite of these developments, the Central Bank's' holdings of Treasury bills declined by Rs. 8.1 billion during the year due to the increased participa\u00adtion by the non-bank public in the Treasury bill market. The non-bank sector holdings of Treasury bills rose from Rs. 25.1 billion at the end of 1991 to Rs. 43.6 billion at the end of 1992. Consequently, the holdings of Treasury bills by the Central Bank declined from Rs. 29.9 billion to Rs. 21.8 billion between the two years.

The downward trend in market indicators was influenced by a number of factors. First, there was a shift of funds from the secondary market to the primary market due to a large number of new companies going public. Second, invest\u00adments in the share market by Unit Trusts were considerably lower than the funds mobi\u00adlized by them, reflecting a cautious approach in investment in the context of depressed market conditions. Third, high interest rates on money market instruments provided alter\u00adnative investment outlets in the context of bearish sentiments in the capital market. Fourth, in spite of further incentives granted by way of the removal of the capital gains tax on share trading and the relaxation of restrictions on share ownership by non-nationals, participation in share trading remained subdued due to a \"wait-and-see\" pol/cy by many participants.",

    "text": "The number of Unit Trusts (UTs) operating in the country increased to four with the establishment of the Ceybank Unit Trust and the Comtrust Equity Fund in 1992. The first two UTs established in 1991 were the National Equity Fund and the Pyramid Unit Trust. The total value of assets of UTs as at end-1992 stood at Rs. 1,943 million, of which Rs. 1,405 million or 72 per cent belonged to the National Equity Fund and the Ceybank Unit Trust. Of the total assets of UTs, only Rs. 780 million or 40 per cent had been invested in the share market. The investments in Treasury bills and money market instruments amounted to Rs. 1,163 million. The overheated market conditions at the time of the establishment of UTs and the depressed conditions in the stock market in the subsequent period appear to have prompted the UTs to be cautious in their investment policy and place greater emphasis on investing in short-term money market instruments.",
