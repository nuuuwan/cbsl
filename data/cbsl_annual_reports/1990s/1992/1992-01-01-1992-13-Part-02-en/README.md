Sale of Gold

In the year under review, with the further liberalisation of trade and exchange controls, it was decided to allow commercial banks to start gold sales operations within the International Airport, Katunayake. Accordingly, measures were taken to cease the operations of the two gold sales outlets of the Central Bank at the Airport. The gold sales outlet at the Departure Lounge was closed with effect from September 29, 1992 and the other sales outlet at the Arrivals Area was closed on November 05, 1992. However, the Central Bank continued its gold sales at the Head Office premises as usual.

Asian Clearing Union

The total value of transactions routed through the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) facility in 1992, amounted to Rs. 21,806 million as compared with Rs. 23,906 million during the previous year. The rupee value of net settlements made in foreign currency in 1992 amounted to Rs. 7,403 million as compared with Rs. 8,756 million in 1991. This reduction in the level of transactions and the net settlement was mainly on account of allowing importers to make payments against their imports from India outside the ACU settlement system. This decision was taken in order to alleviate the difficulties experienced by the importers in Sri Lanka, under the Liberalised Exchange Rate Manage­ment System (LERMS) introduced by India in 1992. The contribution of Sri Lanka to the Swap Facility in the period under review was Rs. 752 million.

Bank Rate

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank Rate) on short-term advances to commer­cial banks under Section 87 of the Monetary Law Act remained unchanged at 17 per cent per annum.

Short Term Credit

The Central Bank continued to provide facilities to commercial banks under the Export Credit Refinance Scheme (ECRS). With effect from March 31, 1992, the margins applicable to Category I and II of the scheme were reduced by one percentage point to 2.0 per cent per annum and 2.8 per cent per annum, respectively. Meanwhile, with effect from December 15, 1992, the refinance rates under Category I and II were increased to 18 per cent per annum and 15 per cent per annum, respectively. At the same time, the margin permitted to the commercial banks under each of the above categories was reduced to 1.5 per cent per annum. The revised rates and the previous rates are given in the following Table.

Changes were also introduced with respect to the coverage, refinance rates and limits applicable to commercial banks under the ECRS. With effect from January 16, 1992, bristle fibre and cinnamon were transferred from Category I to Category II. With effect from February 03,1992, the extent of refinance for remaining items under Category I was revised to a maximum of 60 per cent of the f.o.b. value of the export order or letter of credit, not exceeding, however, the amount of the loan granted by the commercial banks. Before the revision, the extent of refinance applicable to this category had been 50 per cent of the relevant packing credit granted by the commercial banks. As from Decem­ber 01, 1992, the individual limits applicable to banks under Category I were revised downwards resulting in a decline in the overall limit from Rs. 490 million to Rs. 150 million. At the same time, the maximum ceiling of Rs. 10 million imposed on each individual exporter per each item of export under Category II was replaced by individual allocations to commercial banks within an overall limit of Rs. 200 million.

As from December 15, 1992 the interest rate charged by the Central Bank on advances for purchase and storage of commodities under the Guaranteed Price Scheme (GPS) and the Floor Price Scheme was also increased from 9 per cent per annum to 11 per cent per annum.

A new scheme to provide refinance facilities to the Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) in respect of advances to their individual customers or farmer organisa­tions for the purchase/storage of paddy and other crops was introduced and made effective from March 12, 1992. Under this scheme loans were made available for a maximum period of 6 months. At the inception of the scheme, both the refinance rate and the margin permitted to RRDBs were fixed at 9 per cent. With effect from December 15, 1992, the refinance rate was revised upwards to 11 per cent while the margin remained unchanged.

With effect from April 07, 1992, the Central Bank introduced a special refinance facility to commercial banks on account of their advances to seven tea brokering firms to be distributed among tea factory owners to maintain production and to pay arrears on account of green tea leaves supplied by small holders to tea factories. Central Bank's refinance rate and the margin permitted to commercial banks under this scheme were fixed at 17 per cent per annum and 3 per cent per annum, respectively. The initial period of refinance loans was 6 months with provision to extend such loans for further periods not exceeding 6 months at a time upto a total period of 18 months. The outstanding amount of refinance under this scheme amounted to Rs. 258 million at the end of 1992.

Medium and Long Term Credit

The Medium and Long Term Credit Fund (MLCF) was increased by Rs. 925 million to Rs. 4,925 million by the end of 1992.

The interest rates on all categories under the MLCF also were increased by 2 per­centage points each on December 15, 1992. At the same time, the margin applicable to Category I of the Scheme was reduced by two percentage points and those under the other categories by one percentage point each. The revised interest rates and the margins allowed to credit institutions under MLCF are indicated in Table 2.4

The Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House (SLACH) continued to provide the serv­ices of inter-bank cheque clearing facility to commercial banks in Sri Lanka. The daily average number of cheques cleared at the SLACH increased by 17 per cent to 90,000 in 1992.

In June 1992, a system was introduced to levy the cost of items rejected by the Reader/Sorter machines, on relevant

vm

CURRENCY ISSUE

During 1992, the Bank as the sole currency issuing authority, continued to perform the function of issuing legal tender currency in Sri Lanka for use in domestic transac­tions. The volume of currency in circulation as at the end of 1992 stood at Rs. 30,496 million. Notes in circulation comprised 96 per cent of the total currency in circulation.

In 1992, the Bank issued currency notes with new designs in the denominations of Rs. 50/-, Rs. 20/- & Rs. 10/- in the Sri Lanka Heritage Series introduced in 1991.

On January 02, 1992, the Bank issued a coin to commemorate the 3rd anniversary of the induction of His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka, Ranasinghe Premadasa. This particular coin in the denomination of Rs. 1/- was struck in silver. The coin was also struck in cupro nickel for general circulation.

•The "clean currency note" operation launched by the Bank in 1991 was continued during 1992 with the help of the commercial banks.

The mobile currency exhibition of the Bank was launched during 1992. Specimen currency notes of almost all countries of the world, as well as counterfeit notes and defectively printed Sri Lankan notes were displayed in the mobile exhibition, which was of educational value to the viewers, especially the school children. The mobile exhibition was displayed in the rural areas throughout the country in the districts of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Matale, Kandy, Badulla, Moneragala and Matara. The Bank participated in the 14th Gam Udawa Exhibition at Buttala in June 1992 for the first time by running'a stall with cash exchange counters and displaying the mobile currency exhibition.

The Bank automated its currency processing system by installing two currency verification, counting and sorting systems known as the 'CVCS Systems' in the Bank. These systems were commissioned in February 1992 and formally accepted in June 1992. These systems are capable of handling all the currency processing operations at high speed with a few operators.

BANKING DEVELOPMENT

Institutional Network

The banking network in the country continued to expand in 1992. The Regional Rural Development Bank (RRDB), Ampara opened in February.and a branch of the Public Bank Berhad, Malaysia commenced operations in March. The opening of the

IX

RRDB, Ampara marked the beginning of the expansion of the RRDB network to the Eastern Province. The total number of RRDBs by the end of 1992 was 16. The opening of a branch by the Public Bank Berhad was also noteworthy since it marked the opening of a foreign bank branch after nearly a decade.

Another important event that took place during the year was the vesting of the domestic banking business of the three branches of the Bank of Credit & Commerce International Ltd. (BCCI) in the Seylan Bank Ltd. The liquidation of the BCCI was also carried out by the relevant authorities. Accordingly, the number of foreign commercial banks in operation in the country remained unchanged at 17 in 1992. The total number of institutions engaged in banking business including development banking institutions in­creased from 42 in 1991 to 43 in 1992.

During the course of 1992, the RRDBs, the local private commercial banks and the foreign commercial banks expanded their branch network. As in the previous year, the two state commercial banks - the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank - showed relatively slow progress in the expansion of their branch network. The Bank of Ceylon opened only one branch (Koggala) and upgraded one ASC branch (Wellawaya) to a full-fledged branch thereby increasing the total number of main branches to 252 and reducing the number of ASC branches from 36 in 1991 to 35 in 1992. Four extension offices were also opened by the Bank of Ceylon. Meanwhile, the number of Kachcheri . branches of the Bank of Ceylon remained unchanged at 24. The People's Bank opened 5 branches, two in Colombo and one each at Kesbewa, Kottawa and Koggala increasing the total number of branches to 313.

During the year 1992, the Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. opened 7 branches increasing the total number of branches to 28. The Hatton National Bank Ltd. which had 41 branches at the beginning of the year opened 6 more branches. The Seylan Bank Ltd. recorded a rapid expansion in its branch network by opening 15 branches. At the end of the year under review, the Seylan Bank Ltd. had 44 full-fledged branches including the 3 BCCI branches vested in it. The Sampath Bank Ltd. which did not open branches in the previous year, expanded its branch network to 16 by opening 3 branches during 1992.

The foreign commercial banks too continued to expand their branch network during the year. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation opened 3 branches while the Standard Chartered Bank opened 2 branches. The ANZ - Grindlays Bank also opened a branch during the year. At the beginning of the year, the domestic operations of the 3 branches of the BCCI were vested in the Seylan Bank Ltd. while the Public Bank Berhad opened a branch in Colombo. Consequently, the total number of branches of foreign banks increased from 25 at the end of the previous year to 29 at the end of 1992.

The Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) recorded an expansion of their branch network during the year. The RRDB Matara opened 4 branches at Walgama, Deniyaya, Thihagoda and at Kamburupitiya. The RRDB Galle opened 3 branches at Galle Urugasmanhandiya and Yakkalamulla. The RRDB Badulla too opened 3 branches at Uva-Paranagama, Bandarawela and Ridimaliyadda. The RRDBs in Kalutara, Ku-runegala, Mahanuwara (Kandy), Nuwara-Eliya, Polonnaruwa and Ratnapura opened 2 branches each; these, were respectively at Baduraliya and Kalutara - North, Narammala and Polpithigama, Menikhinna and Daulagala, Hanguranketha and Kotagala, Bakamuna

X

and Manampitiya, and at Eheliyagoda and Kolonna. The RRDBs in Anuradhapura, Hambantota, Kegalle, Puttalam and Matale opened one branch each respectively at Konapathirawa, Weeraketiya, Hemmathagama, Mahawewa and at Naula. The RRDB, Ampara which was established in 1992 opened branches at Ampara, Dehiattakandiya, Sammanthurai, Damana and at Akkaraipattu. Consequently, the total number of RRDB branches increased from 124 in 1991 to 156 in 1992.

During the year 1992, the National Savings Bank increased its branch network to 84 by opening 3 branches. The office network of the Development Banking Institutions, i.e. the National Development Bank, Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon and the State Mortgage & Investment Bank remained unchanged during the year.

The Seylan Bank Ltd. established a merchant bank named the Seylan Merchant Bank Ltd. as a subsidiary, increasing the number of merchant banks by one to four.

Mobile Banking Services

The RRDBs as well as some commercial banks continued to provide mobile banking services during 1992 in order to cater to banking needs in remote underbanked and unbanked areas. The Seylan Bank Ltd. commenced Mobile Banking Centres at Weliweriya in the Gampaha District, Manampitiya in the Polonnaruwa District and at Bogawantalawa and Kotagala in the Nuwara-Eliya District. The Hatton National Bank Ltd. too commenced providing of mobile banking services at the Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital and at the International Irrigation Management Institution (IIMI) Building at Thalangama in the Colombo District, and at Bogawantalawa in the Nuwara-Eliya District.

Installation of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)

In contrast to the rapid expansion in the bank branch network, the year 1992 witnessed slow progress in the installation of off-site Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). During the year there was only one installation of an ATM by the Hatton National Bank at the Mt. Lavinia Super Market.

BANK SUPERVISION

The Bank Supervision Department of the Central Bank is responsible for regulation and supervision of commercial banks. Amendments to the Monetary Law Act in February 1992 widened the supervisory role of the Department to cover any banking institution other than a commercial bank and empowered the Monetary Board to issue directions to such institutions to cease and desist from carrying on unsafe and unsound practices, and also to issue directions regarding the form and manner in which any aspect of business should be carried out. The term "Banking Institution" is defined in the amended provisions to include any institution which in the opinion of the Monetary Board is carrying on the business of merchant banking.

The Department carries out these responsibilities through on-site supervision and off-site surveillance. Exercising the powers vested in the Department for undertaking

XI

bank examinations, the Department commenced the examinations of nine commercial banks and one Regional Rural Development Bank (RRDB) in 1992 and concluded seven of them during the year. In addition, the Department undertook for the first time the examination of the National Development Bank (NDB) consequent upon the NDB being declared a banking institution. The examination of three commercial banks which com­menced in 1991 were also concluded in the year under review.

In regard to off-site surveillance, of commercial banks, the Department continued to monitor the financial conditions of commercial banks, FCBUs established under the Foreign Currency Banking Scheme and RRDBs on the basis of monthly statements of Assets and Liabilities furnished by them. The coverage of reporting was widened to include more detailed information on FCBU's lending operations to resident exporters. The analysis of information given in monthly, half yearly and annual returns relating to aspects such as irregular and large advances, movement of deposits and other liabilities, investments and income and expenditure were undertaken by the Department to deter­mine profitability and financial strength of each commercial bank and to compare per­formance of each against industry averages to make a comparative assessment.

The strict application of and securing compliance with regulatory requirements under the Banking Act and other directives issued by the Department constitute the most impor­tant function of the Department. These include the maintenance of minimum level of liquid assets and capital adequacy, the observance of single borrower limits, restrictions on accommodatien to directors and directors' interest, credit ceilings and restrictions on investments. The daily monitoring of foreign working balances of commercial banks and credit ceilings on non-priority sector credit and cash margin requirements on Letters of Credit (LCs) to determine whether they are in line with limits imposed by the Central Bank fall within the ancillary functions of the Department.

Guidelines were issued by the Department on provisioning for non-performing ad­vances in February 1991, in terms of which all commercial banks were required to provide 100 per cent, 50 per cent and 20 per cent in respect of advances classified as loss, doubtful and substandard, respectively, with full compliance being achieved by April 1992. The valuation of securities for provisioning purposes was a major aspect covered in the guidelines. Accordingly, the Department's attention was particularly focussed on monitoring strict compliance with these requirements during the year.

Following the collapse of the BCCI in London and the global suspension of banking operations in July 1991, the operations of the Domestic Banking Unit of the Bank of Credit & Commerce International (Overseas) Limited (BCCI) was vested in the Seylan Bank Ltd. with effect from January 01, 1992 under the Emergency (Banking Special Provisions) Regulations No. 2 of 1991. The Department was therefore closely involved in examining and taking remedial action on several matters relating to the affairs of the BCCI. The formulation of a Relief Scheme to grant redress to the NRFC and RNNFC account holders of the BCCI was among the important measures taken. The Relief Scheme operated in two stages, commenced in January and October 1992, respectively. Under Stage I of the Relief Scheme, depositors with balances below US$ 4,000 were settled in full while those with larger balances were settled partially; the depositors with larger balances getting a progressively declining proportion of their deposits, depending

xn

on size of deposit. The larger depositors who did not receive the full amount of their deposits under Stage I were settled in full under Stage II of the Relief Scheme. The payment was made in Sri Lanka Rupees and made on the condition that the payments would not be convertible into foreign currencies. Negotiations are presently underway with the liquidators to resolve the issues connected with the B.C.C.I.'s FCBU.

In regard to the two State Banks, the on-site examinations conducted by this Depart­ment drew the attention of the management to the inadequacy of provisions for loan losses made by the Banks. Remedial action is contemplated by the Government and steps have already been taken to recapitalise the two State Banks to restore their capital struc­ture to internationally accepted levels.

In the year under review, the Department continued to administer the Deposit Insur­ance Scheme which came into operation in 1987. However, the number of institutions registered under the Scheme declined to 11 during the year following the withdrawal of the two commercial banks participating in the Scheme. The insurance premium was revised upward from 01 cent to 3.75 cents for every Rs. 100 per quarter during the year.

Amendments to the Banking Act and Monetary Law Act are presently being consid­ered and the Department is actively engaged in the formulation of such amendments. The Department made submissions to the Presidential Commission on Banking and Finance on several issues covering regulation and supervision.

NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

The Bank continued to monitor and supervise the finance companies registered with the Central Bank by conducting regular on-site examinations and off-site monitoring on the basis of statistical data furnished by them.

Four companies were registered in 1992 under the provisions of the Finance Compa­nies Act No. 78 of 1988. Out of the 24 finance companies that had been carrying on finance business in 1991, one company could not engage in finance business in 1992, because of its failure to maintain an unimpaired capital of Rs. 5.0 million due to losses.

- The Deposit Relief Scheme which was formulated by the Monetary Board in 1988 continued to be implemented in 1992. As at end of 1992, out of 40,590 deposits in 8 distressed finance companies, relief payments had been made on 36,111 deposits under the Scheme. The total value of payments made was Rs. 462 million. Payments under this Scheme were financed largely by refinance loans granted by the Central Bank. During the year, the Central Bank disbursed Rs. 80 million for the implementation of the Deposit Relief Scheme. In the case of one company, additional relief payments were made utilis­ing the Company's own funds realized from the sale of assets and debt recoveries.

In February, 1992, the management and administration of a registered finance com­pany which was experiencing financial problems, was taken over by the Monetary Board and was granted financial accommodation by way of refinance loans. The total of refi­nance loans granted to this Company during the year 1992 amounted to Rs. 813 million.

xm

During the year 1992, the following directions were issued by the Monetary Board :-

Direction on Single Borrower Limit - On June 19, 1992, a direction was issued re­quiring that the maximum of a single advance or the aggregate of advances granted to and the aggregate outstanding at any point of time on advances granted to an individual borrower should not exceed 10 per cent of the capital funds of a finance company. Further, the maximum of a single advance or the aggregate of advances granted to and advances in aggregate outstanding at any point of time to any group of corporate or unincorporate borrowers with common directors or common partners or common proprietors, should not exceed 15 per cent, of the capital funds of such finance company.

Amendment to Direction No. 2 of 1992 on Provision for Bad & Doubtful Debts -On October 24, 1992, the Monetary Board issued an amended direction requiring the finance companies to make provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debts, in the following manner :-

(i) Twenty five (25) per cent of all advances in arrears for a period of 12 - 24 months;

(ii) Fifty (50) per cent of all advances in arrears for 25 - 36 months;

(iii) Hundred (100) per cent of all advances in arrears for more than 36 months.

However, the amendment further provided that any finance company which fails to comply with the above provision shall refrain from declaring dividends out of profits for the financial year ending March 31, 1992.

Under the Public Security Ordinance, a new regulation, i.e. Regulation No. 1 of 1992 regarding the payment of relief to depositors was promulgated by the President on January 29, 1992. According to this where a finance company is vested in the Monetary Board under Section 20 of the Finance Companies Act, the liability of the vested finance company to meet the demands of the depositors, shall be limited to relief payments which are decided by the Monetary Board, upon the review of the business of the vested finance company.

In 1991, petitions for winding up of affairs were filed in the District Court of Colombo in respect of four companies. The Order was given for the winding up of one of these companies, namely, Sarabhoomi Investments Co. (Pvt) Ltd. in 1992 and a Liquida­tor was accordingly appointed. The petitions filed in respect of other two companies, i.e. Hideki Finance & Investments Ltd. and Castle Finance Ltd. are still being heard in the District Court of Colombo. The case filed for the winding up of House & Property Trades Ltd. (HPTL) in the District Court of Colombo was withdrawn by the Monetary Board, on agreeing to the proposals submitted by the shareowner directors of the Com­pany to settle the deposit liabilities of the Company.

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE

During 1992 the administration of the Medium and Long-term Credit Fund (MLCF), the operation of the Credit Guarantee Schemes for Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMI), the Bus Purchase Loans (BPL) and the Enrepreneurship Development Programme

XIV

continued to be the responsibility of the Development Finance Department (DFD) of the Bank. In July 1992, DFD instituted a Housing Refinance Scheme for low income groups under the United States Agency for International Development (USAJD) Housing Guar­antee Low Income Shelter Programme (HGLISP) Phase IV.

Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund

The suspension of refinance facilities under the MLCF which came into effect in December 1991 continued during 1992. However, the Department followed up on the performance of projects which had been refinanced under the MLCF in the previous years.

Credit Guarantee Operations

A summary of credit guarantee operations under the six credit guarantee schemes administered by the Central Bank as at December 31, 1992 is given in Tables 2.5 and 2.6 respectively.

Small Scale Industries (SSI) Scheme

Out of a total of 767 loans guaranteed under the SSI Scheme during 1978 - 1981, only 10 loans amounting to Rs. 0.58 million were still in operation as at the end of 1992. These loans which are categorised as overdue had a guarantee liability of Rs, 0.44 million.

Small and Medium Scale Industries - I (SMI - I) Scheme

Under the SMI-I Scheme 1,670 guarantees were issued during 1979 - 1982 to cover loans amounting to Rs. 286 million. At the end of 1992, 112 guarantees amounting to Rs. 30 million had either been withdrawn or had lapsed due to non-compliance by the PCII with the Central Bank's operating instructions. A total of 1,216 loans were fully repaid. In 1992, 334 claims with a total liability of Rs. 33 million were received and 224 claims amounting to Rs. 18 million were settled. In terms of a decision to settle claims submitted by PCII in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the country without project inspections, interim payments not exceeding 50 per cent of liability of the Central Bank and amounting to Rs. 2.1 million were made in respect of 27 claims. Loans relating to 37 claims amounting to Rs. 2 million were repaid by the borrowers after submission of the claims, while 28 claims with a total value of Rs. 4.8 million were rejected on account of non-compliance by the PCII with operating instructions. Consideration of 12 claims amounting to Rs. 3 million was deferred on account of either rehabilitation programmes undertaken by the PCII or re-commencement of repayment of the loan by the borrowers after the submission of such claims. At the end of December 1992, only 61 loans amount­ing to Rs. 9.7 million with a maximum guarantee liability of Rs. 5.8 million were re­ported to^be operational. Premiums collected under this scheme and post claim recoveries by the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 12.1 million and Rs. 5.4 million respectively.

Small and Medium Scale Industries - II (SMI-II) Scheme

Out of a total of 2,531 loans guaranteed under the SMI-II Scheme during 1982 -1989, 1,111 loans amounting to Rs. 442 million were fully repaid while 340 guarantees to

the value of Rs. 167 million were either withdrawn or had lapsed as at the end of 1992 due to non-compliance by the PCJJ with the Central Bank's operating instructions. A total of 204 claims with a liability of Rs. 50 million were received as at the end of 1992 and of these 113 claims amounting to Rs. 26 million were settled. Interim payments not exceed­ing 50 per cent of the liability of the Central Bank and amounting to Rs. 0.7 million were made in respect of 5 claims from the. Northern and Eastern Provinces in terms of a decision taken in that regard, while 39 claims amounting to Rs. 9.1 million were rejected on account of non-compliance with operating instructions by the PCU. Loans relating to 2 claims were repaid by the borrowers after submission of claims to the Central Bank. At the end of 1992, consideration of 24 claims amounting to Rs. 7.5 million had been deferred on account of either rehabilitation programme undertaken by the PCU or recom­mencement of repayment of the loans by the borrowers after the submission of such claims. At the end of 1992, 923 loans amounting to Rs. 287 million and with a total Central Bank guarantee liability of Rs. 165 million were operational. Of these, 678 loans with a liability exposure of Rs. 163 million were reported to be in arrears.

The total premium collection under this scheme amounted to Rs. 27 million as at December 31, 1992 while post-claim recoveries by the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 7.0 million.

Small and Medium Scale Industries - III (SMI-III) Scheme

As at the end of 1992, only 3,129 loans amounting to Rs. 1,955 million had been guaranteed under the SMI-III Scheme, which commenced operations in July 1988. In terms of a decision taken with the consent of the PCJJ refinance loans originally approved under SMI-ELI had been transferred to SMI - IV by the National Development Bank (NDB). Consequent to this decision the Central Bank made the transfers to the SMI - IV guarantee scheme. This explains the decline in loans guaranteed in 1992 (3,129) as compared with 1991 (3,883).

Out of the 3,129 loans guaranteed under this scheme, 227 loans amounting to Rs. 99 million were fully repaid while guarantees relating to 267 loans and amounting to Rs. 202 million had either been withdrawn or had lapsed due to non-compliance by the PCJJ with Central Bank's operating instructions. A total of 36 claims with a Central Bank guarantee liability of Rs. 13 million were received as at December 31, 1992. Of these, 16 claims totalling Rs. 314 million were settled while 5 claims totalling Rs. 1.7 million were rejected. Consideration of 3 claims was deferred due to regularisation of the respec­tive loan accounts by the borrowers after the submission of such claims. By the end of December 1992, 2,614 loans amounting to Rs. 1,128 million with a maximum guarantee liability of Rs. 759 million were operational.

The total premium collected under this scheme was Rs. 28 million as at Decem­ber 31, 1992 while Rs. 0.5 million was recovered by the Central Bank as post-claim recoveries during the same period.

Small and Medium Scale Industries - IV (SMI-TV) Scheme

The SMI - IV Scheme was inaugurated in November 1991 with the approval of the Monetary Board and commenced operations in March 1992. By the end of December 1992, 2,621 loans amounting to Rs. 1,916 million had been guaranteed. The Central

xvm

Bank's liability in respect of these loans amounted to Rs. 1,137 million. During the year, 6 loans amounting to Rs. 1.3 million had been fully settled while 22 guarantees had been either withdrawn or had lapsed due to non-compliance with the Central Bank's operating instructions by the PCII. As at the end of 1992, 2,592 guarantees were operational. These covered loans totalling Rs. 841 million where the Central Bank's liability amounted to Rs. 579 million.

The guarantee premium under the SMI - IV Scheme is collected annually unlike under the three previous SMI Schemes. At the end of 1992, a total of Rs. 2.6 million was collected. The performance of the scheme as at the end of 1992 is summarised in Table 2.6.

An industry-wise classification of projects financed under SMI-II, III and IV schemes is given at Table 2.6.

Bus Purchase Loan (BPL) Scheme

This guarantee scheme was inaugurated in November, 1990 by the Central Bank to cover loans granted by the PCII to private bus operators to purchase buses for public

transport. The resources available with the NDB to provide refinance were fully committed by the end of 1992 and the Scheme therefore ceased to operate from this date. Under this scheme, 1928 loans amounting to Rs. 1,097 million were guaranteed with a Central Bank liability of Rs. 871 million. At the end of 1992, 9 loans amounting to Rs. 4.8 million had been fully repaid while 104 guarantees to the value of Rs. 59 million had either lapsed or been withdrawn due to non-compliance with the Central Bank's operating instructions by the PCU.

During 1992, 5 claims amounting to Rs. 3.17 million were received where the Central Bank's liability was Rs. 1.9 million. Of these, one claim amounting to Rs. 0.2 million has been settled and another claim amounting to Rs. 0.6 million was deferred while 3 claims amounting to Rs. 1.8 million were under consideration.

Under the BPL Scheme a total of 1,911 new buses were introduced to the public bus transport fleet by 1,816 borrowers. A significant feature of the scheme was the emer­gence of 1,420. new private bus owners who accounted for 1,463 buses. Expansion by existing bus operators accounted for only 396 borrowers with 448 buses. A total of 1,031 borrowers or 56 per cent of the total loan beneficiaries were engaged in passenger trans­port as single bus owners. Thus, this scheme has contributed both to a broadbasing and an enlarging of private bus ownership.

The total premium collection under the scheme amounted to Rs. 8.9 million as at December 31,1992.

Housing Guarantee Low Income Shelter Programme (HGLISP) Phase IV

In terms of Section 106(1) of the Monetary Law Act (MLA) the Central Bank instituted a refinance scheme in July 1992 for the administration of the HGLISP - Phase IV, to improve shelter conditions of urban and rural low income households. Under this scheme the Bank functions as the Apex Lender. Refinance facilities are granted by the CBSL from the funds loaned to the Government of Sri Lanka under the United States Government Housing Loan Guarantee Programme - Phase IV. These funds are made available to the participating credit institutions (PCU) designated as Sub-Apex Lenders (SALL)/Direct Primary Lenders (DPLL) who have entered into an agreement with the CBSL under the HGLISP-Phase IV Programme. Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, Hatton National Bank Ltd., State Mortgage & Investment Bank and Seylan Bank Ltd. had entered into agreement with the Central Bank as at the end of 1992.

The Sub-Apex Lenders are required to lend these funds direct to eligible households or through Primary Lenders such as Co-operative Rural Banks, Federation of Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies, Real Estate Development Companies or Insurance Companies. The Primary Lenders are required in turn to lend these funds to eligible households. Under the eligibility criteria used in 1992 rural households earning Rs. 2,960 per month and urban households earning Rs. 3,700 per month were eligible to borrow funds under this scheme for acquisition of land for house construction, new house con­struction, additions or improvements to existing houses, renovations of existing houses and for housing infrastructure.

The disbursement of refinance under this scheme, commenced in mid-October 1992 and by the end of December 1992 refinance approval was granted for 4,273 housing loans amounting to Rs. 27 million.

The Project covers the eight districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar. Mullaitivu and Vavuniya in the North, Amparai, Batticaloa and Trincomalee in the East and the bordering districts of Anurad­hapura. Hambantota, Moneragala, Polonnaruwa and Puttalam. The Project Management Unit which was set up in the Rural Credit Department of the Bank in October 1991, for implementation of the credit component of the project provided refinance facilities total­ling Rs. 31.5 million to Banks in respect of 626 sub-loans granted by the PCII during 1992. The Unit carried out a vigorous publicity campaign to create an awareness among the borrowers about the scheme and conducted seven training programmes in association with the Rural Banking and Staff Training College for the benefit of bank staff in the project area with a view to expediting the implementation of the project.

The CBSL is the apex implementing agency for the credit component of the South­ern Province Rural Development Project (SPRD Project) funded by the ADB. The CBSL will provide refinance facilities under the project to finance small/medium scale indus­trial enterprises located at Charley Mount Industrial Estate and small/medium scale rural enterprises in the Southern Province.

A Loan Agreement has been signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and the ADB to obtain a loan of US$ 30.0 million from the ADB to implement the North Western Province Water,Resources Development Project (NWP/WRD Project) during a 7 year period from 1992 to 1998. The CBSL is the apex implementing agency for the credit component of US$ 2.7 million of the project. Under the credit scheme refinance will be provided for construction of dug wells, lift irrigation schemes and for small scale self-employment projects undertaken by rural women. Disbursement of credit has not commenced as yet.

The Inland Bill Scheme continued to operate during the year 1992, with the approval of one acceptance credit limit amounting to Rs. 0.8 million, bringing the total number of such limits to 30. This scheme was introduced in 1989 in order to assist green leaf suppliers and Bought Leaf Factory Owners through commercial banks in the tea sector. Subsequently this scheme was extended to provide financial assistance to buyers and sellers of milk through Nuwara Eliya RRDB.

REGIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS

The Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) continued to promote the devel­opment of the rural economy by mobilising savings, chanelling credit and extending promotional services.

Expansion of RRDB Network

With the establishment of the Ampara Regional Rural Development Bank in Febru­ary, the number of RRDBs in operation as at the end of 1992 increased to 16 while the number of branches expanded considerably from a total of 124 in 1991 to a total of 156 at the end of 1992.

Deposit Mobilization

The RRDBs recorded considerable progress in mobilizing savings during 1992. As at end 1992, deposits of the RRDBs were Rs. 666 million of which fixed deposits amounted to 12 per cent and savings deposits to 88 per cent. The total number of savings accounts in 1992 was 570,360 and the total number of fixed accounts was 3,365. The value of deposits of RRDBs in 1992 recorded an increase of 52 per cent over 1991 while the total number of deposit accounts in 1992 at 573,725 recorded an increase of 35 per cent. This increase was mainly due to the expansion of the branch network into remote underbanked and unbanked areas and an increase in development activities in rural areas, the introduc­tion of innovative savings schemes, the implementation of compulsory savings schemes and to efforts taken at village level meetings to promote the savings habits.

The average size of a savings account which was Rs. 920/- in 1991 increased by about 12 per cent to Rs. 1,030/- in 1992 while the average value of a fixed deposit increased by 25 per cent from Rs. 18,929/- in 1991 to Rs. 23,661/- in 1992.

Loan Operations

During the year 1992, the RRDBs granted a total of Rs. 703 million in respect of 71,559 loans in comparison with Rs. 595 million granted in respect of 60,315 loans during 1991.

Of the total loans granted by RRDBs during 1992, the percentage share of loans granted for small industries, commerce and business increased from 23 per cent in 1991 to 28 per cent in 1992 while the share of agriculture declined to 46 per cent.

XXIV

Loans granted under the pawning scheme increased by 96 per cent over the previous year and amounted to Rs. 302 million. The number of loans granted at 118,978 recorded a similar increase over the previous year.

At the end of the current year, the total value of loans outstanding of all RRDBs amounted to Rs. 1,116 million representing an increase of about 38 per cent over the level at the end of 1991. Of the total, loans granted for agriculture accounted for the largest share of 40 per cent while loans granted for commerce and business purposes accounted for 13 per cent and loans extended to small industries was 10 per cent. The share of agricultural loans has shown a decreasing trend over the last few years - declin­ing from 52 per cent in 1990 to 40 per cent in 1992.

Other Activities

During 1992, RRDBs launched special saving schemes for children and provided additional facilities for savings accounts in their effort to promote savings.

RRDBs have continued to implement special loan schemes to assist the poverty alleviation programmes. Under these schemes, the RRDBs provided credit facilities on easy terms for self-employment. The RRDBs, also provided other facilities such as train­ing of beneficiaries in order to ensure the success of these projects.

As rural producers face difficulties in marketing their produce, the RRDBs attempted to provide assistance in the field of marketing. The RRDBs in Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, Mahanuwara, Moneragala, Matale, Hambantota, Anuradhapura, Badulla and Puttalam purchased paddy, chillies, onions and green gram valued at Rs. 20 million under the agricultural products storage scheme. These products were stored until prices improved and this enabled producers to obtain higher prices.

Small- Farmers and Landless Credit Project

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is the executing agency for the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project (SFLCP) funded by the International Fund for Agricultural De­velopment (IFAD) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The IFAD provides a loan of SDR 4.85 million for the project and the CEDA provides a grant of SDR 4.7 million. This amounts to 74 per cent of the total cost of the project. The Government contribution to the project is 23 per cent of the total project cost and the remaining 3 per cent is contributed by beneficiary savings.

During 1992, credit was channelled to the identified beneficiaries, i.e. the rural poor who are below the abject poverty line. Loans were granted to beneficiaries in the districts of Kandy, Puttalam, Galle and Matara. The value of loans approved in 1992 recorded an increase of 91 per cent in comparison with 1991. Loans amounting to Rs. 52 million were approved in respect of 7,146 beneficiaries in comparison with loans amounting to Rs. 27 million to 4,676 beneficiaries during the previous year.

/ The value of loans approved during the period 1990 to 1992 amounts to Rs. 83 million in respect of 12,518 beneficiaries. The savings of beneficiaries during this period amounted to Rs. 10 million. A noteworthy feature of this project is the average

XXV

loan recovery rate of 92 per cent. Further, an important feature of this project is the number of female beneficiaries accounting for 58 per cent of the total number of beneficiaries.

By the end of 1992, the project completed surveying 1,006 villages. 2,936 groups were formed and registered with the project. The total number of beneficiaries registered were 17,923. .

In addition to the identification of beneficiaries, the formation of small groups, mobilization of savings and the provision of credit, other support services such as training and technical assistance are also provided to beneficiaries. The project is implemented by the Central Bank through participating agencies, the Project District Offices and the Regional Rural Development Banks.

RURAL BANKING & STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

The Rural Banking and Staff Training College (RB & STC) of the Bank conducted 67 training courses for 1,901 persons during 1992 compared with 97 training courses conducted for 2,385 persons during 1991.

Out of the 67 training courses conducted in 1992, only 29 were conducted at the College and the balance 38 were conducted in the outstations. The participants of those training courses conducted in the outstations numbering 1,104 consisted mostly of small, scale entrepreneurs and self-employed persons who were either those already receiving credit facilities provided mostly by the RRDBs or those who were anticipating to receive institutional credit facilities made available by the RRDBs. A total of 797 participants consisting 201 participants from the Central Bank, 138 from commercial banks and 458 participants from the RRDBs attended the 29 courses conducted in the College in 1992.

Rural banking, project-oriented development, commercial banking, international trade, foreign exchange operations, hire purchase and lease financing, management, train­ing of trainers, computer training and small entrepreneur development were the main areas of training provided by the RB & STC in 1992. In addition to the scheduled training courses conducted in 1992, the RB &STC conducted several special training courses on request for the benefit of the field level officers attached to : (a) the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project for which, Central Bank is the executing agency; (b) Agricultural Rehabilitation Project; and (c) Mid-country Perennial Crop Development Project.

The RB & STC also conducted an orientation course for the benefit of those Central Bank officials who were qualified to be exempted from the Efficiency Bar Examination and held the 11th anniversary lecture on "Human Resources Development" and necessary preliminary arrangements have also been made to set up an English Language Self-Learning Laboratory at the College in due course to assist those in need of English language knowledge improvements.

EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND (EPF)

In terms of the Employees' Provident Fund Act, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is charged with the responsibility of receiving contributions, sur-

XXVI

charges and income from the investment of the monies of the Fund, maintaining proper accounts of registered employers and the individual members of the Fund and also effect­ing refund of benefits to its members. These activities were carried out in close co-operation with the Employees' Provident Fund Division of the Department of Labour which attends to the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the E.P.F. Act.

Contributions

The contributions received by the Fund during the year 1992 amounted to Rs. 5,294.5 million as against Rs. 4,421.3 million in 1991. This represents an increase of Rs. 873.2 million or 19.7 per cent over the level of contributions received during the previous year.

Members' Balances

Members' balances as at December 31, 1992, before allocation of interest for the year under review stood at Rs. 45,790.6 million which is an increase of Rs. 7,328.1 million or 19 per cent over that of 1991.

Investments

During the year under review, the Fund invested a sum of Rs. 26,742.4 million in Government Securities, Treasury bills and Inter Bank Call Money Market as against a sum of Rs. 16,014.4 million in 1991. This is an increase of Rs. 10,728 million over the level of investments in 1991. The total investments held by the Fund as at December 31, 1992 amounted to Rs. 54,834.7 million which is an increase of Rs. 8,588.4 million over the level of 1991.

Income Received from Investments

In terms of an amendment to the Inland Revenue Act in 1989, the exemption from income tax granted to the EPF was withdrawn. Accordingly, all income earned on invest­ments with effect from April 01, 1989 is subject to a Withholding Tax of 10 per cent. The total Withholding Tax deducted from the investment income for the year 1992 was Rs. 690.5 million.

In 1992, the income received from investments amounted to Rs. 6,905.5 million as against Rs. 5,648.2 million in 1991, recording an increase of Rs. 1,257.3 million.

Refunds

The total sum paid out by way of refund of E.P.F. benefits to members during the year 1992, amounted to Rs. 2,265.1 million as against Rs. 1,344.2 million in 1991. This records an increase of Rs. 920.9 million or 68.5 per cent. During the year under review 49,864 claims for refund of benefits were paid out, as against 38,910 claims disposed of in 1991.

XXVII

Interest on Members' Balances

The Employees' Provident Fund is required to pay interest on members' Balances as at the end of each year out of the income from investment of monies of the Fund. The rate of interest payable on members' balances as at the end of 1992 was 11.5 per cent per annum.

Interest is paid on the cumulative balance standing to the credit of members at the end of the year. All contributions received during the year irrespective of the date of receipt of such monies qualify for the payment of the interest for the entire year -e.g.: contributions received in December attracts interest for the full year in the same Way as contributions received in January of that year. Therefore, the effective rate of interest is somewhat higher.

EPF Housing Loan Scheme

The E.P.F. Act was amended by Act No. 42 of 1988 to enable the members to obtain a loan of upto 75 per cent of the balance standing to their credit from certain lending institutions for housing purposes. The participating lending institutions in this scheme are Housing Development Finance Corporation, National Housing Development Authority, State Mortgage and Investment Bank, People's Bank, Bank of Ceylon, National Savings Bank and the Multipurpose Co-operative Societies spread out in the country.

As of December 31, 1992 the E.P.F. Department processed and despatched a total of 45,588 applications for certification of balances to the respective Labour Offices.

The comparative data on the operations of the Fund are given in Table 2.10.

Permission has also been granted to non-resident NRFC account holders and holders of FCBU accounts to make investments in these companies with the funds in such foreign currency accounts.

8. Loans and Overdrafts

PUBLIC DEBT

The Bank continued to manage the Public Debt on behalf of the Government in terms of Section 113 of the Monetary Law Act. The major debt instruments used by the Bank were Government Securities/Loans, Treasury Bills (TBs), Debentures and Treasury Certificates of Deposit (CDs). The Bank also handled the management and servicing of foreign debt of the Government. In addition, a data base both for foreign debt and domestic debt was maintained and studies were also undertaken to assist in the formula­tion of policies in respect of Public Debt.

The total outstanding gross Government Debt as at the end of 1992 was Rs. 418,624 million. The increase in the debt amounting to Rs. 38,849 million was lower than that in 1991. The outstanding external debt liabilities during the year amounted to Rs. 238,730 million indicating an increase of Rs. 19,747 million of which a sum of Rs. 12,531 million was on account of exchange rate depreciations. Of the outstanding Government debt, foreign debt accounted for 57 per cent while the balance 43 per cent represented domestic debt.

Rs. 20,920 million worth of Government rupee loans were floated during 1992. Total repayments of rupee loans and interest payments during the year amounted to Rs. 18,094 and Rs. 9,273 million, respectively. The amount outstanding as at the end of 1992 was Rs.73,712 million including Rs. 4,532 million of National Defence Bonds. The Employees' Provident Fund was the major subscriber to the Rupee Loan Programme in 1992 and held 74 per cent of the total rupee loans outstanding as at the end of 1992. The National Savings Bank held 19 per cent of the outstanding debt.

XXXI

The authorised limit on Treasury Bills was increased from Rs. 90,000 million to Rs. 125,000 million on December 16, 1992. There were two major policy changes in the marketing of Treasury Bills during 1992. Deviating from the procedures hitherto followed, the Bank appointed Accredited Primary Dealers to sell Treasury Bills with effect from July 24, 1992. Since then, only Accredited Primary Dealers are allowed to bid at weekly tenders and the public has to purchase Treasury Bills from these dealers. However, non-competitive bids from captive sources are also accepted at the weighted average rate for the respective maturity periods. At the end of 1992, 18- Primary Dealers consisting of thirteen Commercial Banks, four Money Broking firms and one Manage­ment Company of a Unit Trust were accredited as Primary Dealers. The other policy change was to invite bids for longer maturities of 24, 36 and 48 months along with the 3, 6 and 12 month maturities. Treasury Bills with maturity period of less than 3 months were also issued to the Central Bank. The remarkable feature of Treasury Bill operations during 1992 was the decline in the share of Treasury Bills held by the Central Bank from 48.0 per cent as at the end of 1991 to 29.9 per cent as at the end of 1992. Treasury Bills outstanding as at the end of 1992 was Rs. 87,096 million compared with Rs. 72,968 million as at the end of 1991. This increase represented new issues of Treasury Bills amounting to Rs. 14,128 million. The total interest paid during the year in respect of Treasury Bills was Rs. 11,355 million.

The Bank continued to issue Treasury Certificates of Deposit which commenced in 1990. The Certificates were issued for 6, 12 and 24 months maturity periods at the rates of interest of 17.15 per cent, 18.06 per cent and 19.83 per cent, respectively. The amount outstanding as at the end of 1992 was Rs. 102 million.

Total disbursements on medium and long term external Government debt during 1992 amounted -to Rs. 14,355 million. Project loans accounted for 68.3 per cent of the total amount utilized while the balance represented non-project loans. The total interest payments and other charges on external Government debt in 1992 was Rs. 4,725 million.

REGIONAL OFFICES - MATARA, ANURADHAPURA & MATALE

There has been an increase in development related work of the Regional Offices at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale such as conducting beneficiary training programmes arid seminars for prospective borrowers, identifying resources which could be harnessed for development purposes and coordinating the activities of Government departments and other agencies involved in development work in the respective regions. However, these activities which centered around identification, appraisal and recommendation of viable projects to credit institutions for financing and post-supervision of such projects declined during 1992 with the suspension of the grant of refinance under the MLCF credit scheme in December, 1991.

The traditional Central Banking functions performed by the Regional Offices namely, currency operations, cheque clearing and data collection were expanded during the year under review. The Regional Offices also continued to assist prospective borrow­ers with the preparation of farm budgets and cash flow statements required in order to obtain loans under the Small Holder Tea Development Project and the Perennial Crop Development Project. With the objective of promoting the banking habit in rural areas, the Regional Officers continued to hold village level meetings (Janahamuwas) in their respective regions.

XXXII

The main activity of the Anuradhapura Regional Office during 1992 was that of conducting training programmes for prospective borrowers. During the year under review, the Regional Office, in association with other development agencies conducted 49 training classes, covering subjects such as agriculture, dairy development and rice processing. These classes were attended by around 3,000 participants. The Regional Office conducted the examination of several branches of the Kurunegala and Polon­naruwa RRDBs. This office also earned out a resource survey in a selected village in the Horowpatana AGA division.

During the year, the Matara Regional Office conducted a resource survey in a se­lected number of villages in the region. The total number of projects recommended by the Regional Office to credit institutions for financing fell sharply.

The Matale Regional Office recommended 2,434 projects valued at Rs. 32.8 million during 1992. This indicated a decline of 46 per cent in the number of projects recom­mended when compared with the previous year. The Regional Office conducted 9 benefi­ciary training programmes for around 1,500 unemployed youth and small scale entrepre­neurs. In view of the importance of providing marketing facilities to producers, the Regional Office provided assistance to farmers especially to small scale producers of big-onions, to sell their produce. In addition, the Regional Office carried out an examina­tion of bank branches of RRDBs in the Central Province and in the Kegalle District.

The Currency Units of the Regional Offices of Matara and Anuradhapura continued to provide currency exchange facilities to commercial hanks, other institutions and the general public in their respective regions. The commercial banks in the regions are also provided with cash deposit and withdrawal facilities at the vaults of above two Regional Offices. A "Clean Currency Notes Week" conducted in Matale and Kandy districts by the Matale Regional Office in 1992 provided an opportunity to educate the public on the need to ensure the cleanliness of currency notes in circulation.

With the appointment of accredited dealers for the sale of Treasury Bills at the primary market, the sale of Treasury Bills at Regional Offices was discontinued in June, 1992. The amount of Treasury Bills sold by Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale Regional Offices during the first half of 1992 stood at Rs. 66.2 million, Rs. 0.1 million and Rs. 66.9 million respectively.

The Regional Cheque Clearing facilities offered to Commercial Banks by Regional Offices continued during the year 1992. A total of 174,198 cheques amounting to Rs. 2,305 million was cleared through the Regional Cheque Clearing House at Matara while the Anuradhapura Cheque Clearing House cleared 115,389 cheques amounting to Rs. 1,780 million, during year 1992. The Regional Office at Matale cleared a total of 406,830 cheques valued at Rs. 11,216 million through its Cheque Clearing Houses at Kandy and Matale.

The Regional Offices took part in the island-wide data collection programme and other Regional Surveys conducted by the Central Bank in their respective regions. They assisted in the educational programmes in economics and banking conducted by the Bank during 1992 for school children.

The art work and visual section of the media unit continued to design brochures and publications for various departments. It is to the credit of the competence of this unit, that the design of the coin to be issued in commemoration of the Mihindu Jayanthi celebra­tions to be held in 1993 was accepted.

The Department's educational programmes launched were targetted to GCE Advanced Level Students and teachers in the periphery. Around 5,000 students in the Moneragala, Anuradhapura and Matale Districts benefitted by these programmes which were conducted by specially selected staff of the Bank.

SURVEYS AND DATA COLLECTION

In 1992, the Bank commenced a comprehensive household survey in order to ascer­tain the credit needs in the country with special emphasis on the poor. The objectives of this survey are to -

(a) Identify the extent to which institutional credit has spread in the Rural sector and the extent to which it has met the credit needs of the lower income groups in the Urban, Rural and Estate sectors. (b) Evaluate the credit needs of both borrowers and non-borrowers.

(c) Assess the adequacy of bank credit available to borrowers and the supplemen­tary sources of credit.

(d) Evaluate the success or failure of projects started with money borrowed from institutional sources.

With these objectives in view, information relating to income generating activities, sources of credit, credit usage, entrepreneurship and loan repayment is sought from sampled households. In order to afford an indepth analysis of credit needs, information on socio-economic conditions such as demographic characteristics, housing conditions, land use, labour force employment and manpower use, household income, savings and indebtedness, is also collected from the households.

In this survey, about 32,000 households sampled from 43 urban wards representing the Urban sector, 216 villages representing the Rural sector and 10 estates representing the Estate sector will be enumerated. Data collection which commenced in May, 1992 would continue for a period of one year in order to capture seasonal variations.
