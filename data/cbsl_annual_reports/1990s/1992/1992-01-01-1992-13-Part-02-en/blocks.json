This reduction in the level of transactions and the net settlement was mainly on account of allowing importers to make payments against their imports from India outside the ACU settlement system. This decision was taken in order to alleviate the difficulties experienced by the importers in Sri Lanka, under the Liberalised Exchange Rate Manage\u00adment System (LERMS) introduced by India in 1992.

Before the revision, the extent of refinance applicable to this category had been 50 per cent of the relevant packing credit granted by the commercial banks. As from Decem\u00adber 01, 1992, the individual limits applicable to banks under Category I were revised downwards resulting in a decline in the overall limit from Rs. 490 million to Rs. 150 million. At the same time, the maximum ceiling of Rs. 10 million imposed on each individual exporter per each item of export under Category II was replaced by individual allocations to commercial banks within an overall limit of Rs. 200 million.",

A total of 1,216 loans were fully repaid. In 1992, 334 claims with a total liability of Rs. 33 million were received and 224 claims amounting to Rs. 18 million were settled. In terms of a decision to settle claims submitted by PCII in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the country without project inspections, interim payments not exceeding 50 per cent of liability of the Central Bank and amounting to Rs. 2.1 million were made in respect of 27 claims. Loans relating to 37 claims amounting to Rs. 2 million were repaid by the borrowers after submission of the claims, while 28 claims with a total value of Rs. 4.8 million were rejected on account of non-compliance by the PCII with operating instructions. Consideration of 12 claims amounting to Rs. 3 million was deferred on account of either rehabilitation programmes undertaken by the PCII or re-commencement of repayment of the loan by the borrowers after the submission of such claims. At the end of December 1992, only 61 loans amount\u00ading to Rs. 9.7 million with a maximum guarantee liability of Rs. 5.8 million were re\u00adported to^be operational. Premiums collected under this scheme and post claim recoveries by the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 12.1 million and Rs. 5.4 million respectively.",

There were two major policy changes in the marketing of Treasury Bills during 1992. Deviating from the procedures hitherto followed, the Bank appointed Accredited Primary Dealers to sell Treasury Bills with effect from July 24, 1992. Since then, only Accredited Primary Dealers are allowed to bid at weekly tenders and the public has to purchase Treasury Bills from these dealers. However, non-competitive bids from captive sources are also accepted at the weighted average rate for the respective maturity periods. At the end of 1992, 18- Primary Dealers consisting of thirteen Commercial Banks, four Money Broking firms and one Manage\u00adment Company of a Unit Trust were accredited as Primary Dealers. The other policy change was to invite bids for longer maturities of 24, 36 and 48 months along with the 3, 6 and 12 month maturities. Treasury Bills with maturity period of less than 3 months were also issued to the Central Bank. The remarkable feature of Treasury Bill operations during 1992 was the decline in the share of Treasury Bills held by the Central Bank from 48.0 per cent as at the end of 1991 to 29.9 per cent as at the end of 1992. Treasury Bills outstanding as at the end of 1992 was Rs. 87,096 million compared with Rs. 72,968 million as at the end of 1991. This increase represented new issues of Treasury Bills amounting to Rs. 14,128 million. The total interest paid during the year in respect of Treasury Bills was Rs. 11,355 million.",
