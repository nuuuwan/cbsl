Hydro electricity generation which dropped sharply during the first half of the year considerably improved with the return of favourable weather conditions. Consequently, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was able to reduce its dependence on thermal power to a negligible level during the second half of 1992. Despite disruption to . the power supply process, the demand for electricity further expanded during the year under review. Meanwhile, the sharp increase in demand for heavy diesel and furnace oil on account of thermal power generation considerably slowed down during the latter part of the year. However, the domestic consumption of auto diesel and super diesel continued to. rise during the year due to the relative price advantage of these products.",

Total hydro electricity generation stood at 2,900 GWh in 1992, recording a decline of 7 per cent. This was entirely due to the sharp drop of 31 per cent in hydro power generation during the first six months of the year on account of a drastic reduction in the water levels in the hydro reservoirs. Consequently, thermal power generation increased considerably reaching 640 GWh in 1992 compared with 260 GWh in 1991. As a result, cost of fuel on power generation rose to Rs. 1,657 million during the year under review from Rs. 459 million in 1991. Meanwhile, the losses involved in the power generation, transmission and distribution dropped from 18.8 per cent in 1991 to 17.6 per cent in 1992.",

However, domestic consumers and religious organisations whose consumption remained below 50 and 150 units, respec\u00adtively were exempted from this levy. Moreover, the CEB imposed an islandwide power cut during April-May, 1992 in order to curtail power consumption. Despite these meas\u00adures, the sales of electricity totalled 2,915 GWh reflecting an increase of 6 per cent over the previous year. Sales to the domestic sector rose by 8 per cent to 696 GWh.

    "text": "During 1992, the scale of operations of the SLR, in terms of operated kilometerage marginally declined to 7.5 million kilometers. Similarly, passenger kilometerage dropped marginally to 2,634 million kilometers. However, the freight services indicated by cargo ton kilometerage at 173 million in 1992 recorded an increase of 2 per cent over the previous year. The drop in both operated kilometerage and passenger kilometerage of SLR was largely due to the disruptions to train services on the main line on account of the subsidence of rail track at Watawela since July 1992. In addition, as in the previous year, the SLR was precluded from operating the normal services to the North and Eastern provinces due to the continued civil disturbances that prevailed in those regions. How\u00adever, the overall adverse impact of the reduced scale of operations of the SLR was partly mitigated by an improvement in train services in the rest of the country, The measures such as the provision of more comfortable passenger carriages on long distance trains, the operation of through trains from Anuradhapura and Kandy to Matara, introduction of new power sets into the suburban service and broadguaging of the Kelani Valley line from Maradana to Nugegoda largely contributed to improve the patronage level of the SLR during 1992. Meanwhile, there was an expansion in the freight market for cement and flour during the year.",

The expansion of the activities of the private omnibus transportation was further facilitated by the availabil\u00adity of credit facilities to purchase buses through BPL Loan Scheme of the National Development Bank (NDB) which was fully utilised by end -1992. Under this scheme, a total of 1,816 loans were disbursed to purchase 1,911 buses by the end of 1992.
