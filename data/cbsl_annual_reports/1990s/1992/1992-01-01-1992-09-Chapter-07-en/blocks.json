Despite a set-back to agricultural exports, total export earnings grew by 20 per cent* in 1992 as compared with a 2 per cent growth in 1991. Meanwhile, the expenditure on imports recorded a slightly moderated rise of 10 per cent in 1992 compared with an increase of 13 per cent in the previous year. Consequently, the trade deficit declined by 8 per cent, to SDR 686 million in 1992 from SDR 747 million in 1991. These develop\u00adments resulted in raising the ratio of export earnings to import payments from 66 per cent in 1991 to 72 per cent in 1992.",

Tea exports suffered heavily due to the adverse effects of a prolonged drought experienced during the early part of the year and the depressed conditions in the world market for tea.

According to adjusted customs data, total export earnings grew by 20 per cent to reach SDR 1/782 million (Rs. 110,052 million) in 1992. This reflected a significant increase from SDR 1,491 million (Rs. 84,378 million) recorded in 199.1. The decline in earnings from tea exports by 24 per cent was largely offset by increased earnings from industrial exports, as well as higher earnings from other agricultural exports such as rubber, coco\u00adnut and minor agricultural products.

Licence control for seed potatoes was to maintain phytosanitary standards. Among other imports brought under licence control were paddy, rice (semi-milled, wholly milled brown rice) and some chemical produces (including colloidal precious metal, silver nitrate, gold components etc.). In the case of exports, there were no changes during 1992 and 11 items remained under licence control mainly for environmental reasons. As there appear to be no rationale for maintaining import and export licencing for some of these items, a special committee under the Presidential Tariff Commission was appointed in 1992 to examine this issue.",
