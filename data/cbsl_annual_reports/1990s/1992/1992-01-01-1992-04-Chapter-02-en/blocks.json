This growth, though lower than the rate of 4.6 per cent recorded in 1991, is commendable, as it has been achieved in the face of a worldwide recession and very unfavourable weather conditions that had serious adverse effects on the primary sector of the economy. It was also evident that the change in economic policies adopted has led to a more diversified economy in which the relative importance of the primary sector, consisting of agriculture and mining and quarrying, has been reduced to some degree. Consequently, the economy was able to maintain an encouraging rate of growth in spite of a decline in the primary sector. The Gross National Product (GNP) grew by 4.4 per cent in 1992, in comparison to a growth of 4.6 per cent recorded in 1991.",

The overall Manufacturing sector continued its growth momentum, recording an expansion of 9 per cent in 1992, up from 6.8 per cent in 1991. This growth was the result of an impressive increase in the value added in factory industry by 13.0 per cent. Factory industry, which accounted for over three fourths of the total value added in Manufacturing, is dominated by the garments and other export-oriented industries and its expansion was reflected in an increase in Sri Lanka's industrial exports by 37 per cent in SDR terms in 1992.",

    "text": "The slight moderation in the growth of the Sri Lankan economy in 1992 was due mainly to the effects of adverse weather conditions and worldwide recession. The severe drought that prevailed from about December 1991 to April 1992 caused the agriculture sub-sector to contract by 2.3 per cent in 1992, in contrast to a growth of 0.8 per cent in 1991. However, a growth of 4.1 per cent in 1992 in the fishing sub-sector, softened the impact of this contraction to contain the decline in the overall Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector to 1.5 per cent. This sector had grown by 1.9 per cent in 1991. The decrease in the output of agricultural products had not only a direct impact on this sector, but also reduced the growth in associated areas such as export processing, transport and domestic trade. The continuing worldwide recession led to a further slowing down in the exports of gems and other minerals, resulting in a significant decline in the mining sub-sector. The impact of increased activity in construction, however, led to greater value addition in quarrying activity which helped alleviate, to some extent, the adverse repercussions of the decline in mining. As a result, the overall Mining and Quarrying sector recorded a decline only of 6 per cent.",

    "text": "The overall Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector, recorded a contraction of 1.5 per cent in 1992. In view of the relatively high weight of agriculture in total GNP, and the interlinks between agriculture and other sectors such as agro-based industry, transport and trade, this decline bore the primary responsibility for the lower growth in GNP in 1992 than in 1991. The impact of the extended drought was clearly seen in plantation agriculture, paddy, sugar cane and subsidiary food crops. The effects of the long drought and excessive rain thereafter were most severe in the tea plantations, resulting in the lowest level of tea production in over a quarter of a century. Value added in the tea sub-sector declined by 25.7 per cent, leading to a decline of 8.1 per cent in value added in the plantation sector, despite coconuts recording an increase of 9 per cent. Delayed rains led to a poor Yala season, with the Yala paddy production falling by 15 per cent in 1992. Consequently, the overall paddy output decreased by 2 per cent in 1992, though the Maha harvest had been favourable, with a 5 per cent increase in production. The 'Other' Agriculture sub-sector, which comprises mainly subsidiary food crops, minor export crops, fruits, vegetables, livestock and crops such as tobacco and sugar cane, had. a marginal growth. Although the value added in both subsidiary food crops and minor export crops decreased, increases in fruits, vegetables and other commodities were able to offset this and yield a marginal growth in the sub-sector.",
