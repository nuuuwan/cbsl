This resulted in a slight increase in the wage rate index for government employees which had remained static since November 1990. Overall, Nominal wages for All Central Government Employees rose by 4.3 per cent in 1992, in comparison to a 12.1 per cent increase in 1991. The real wage rate index of Central Government Employees declined by 6.4 per cent in 1992, whereas in 1991, the real wage rate index remained unchanged. The nominal wage rate index of Government School Teachers increased by 3.8 per cent in 1992, while the real wage rate index decreased by 6.8 per cent. The corresponding figures for 1991 were an increase of 10 per cent in the nominal wage rate index and a decline of 1.9 per cent in the real wage rate index.",

In 1991, total employment in the public sector declined by 3.3 per cent. This was partly due to the privatisation programme of State Institutions. Employment in Government institutions, which included Central Government Ministries and Departments as well as the Provincial Government and Local Government sub sectors, is estimated to be 653,959 at the end of 1992, registering a marginal.increase of 0.2 per cent over 1991. The increase was largely reflected in the occupational category of Professional, Technical and Related Workers, in the sub category of teachers in particular. Employment in the Semi-Government sector which included public corporations, statutory boards, government owned business under\u00adtakings and state banks, registered a decline of 3.1 per cent over 1991, following the trend observed in the previous year.",

The total private sector employment in Approved Provident Funds is estimated to have increased by 10 per cent in 1992 over the previous.year.

An Airport Survey conducted by the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) disclosed that in 1992 a total of 124,494 persons had secured employ\u00adment abroad through licensed agencies and the SLFEB, as against 65,007 persons in 1991. In view of the fact that a large number of persons secure employment abroad through private channels, apart from licensed agencies and the SLFEB, the actual number securing employment abroad may be even greater. It is revealed that the number who have secured employment abroad through licensed agencies and the SLFEB is approxi\u00admately one half of the total number securing foreign employment.",
