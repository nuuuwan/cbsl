In the balance of payments, there was an overall surplus of SDR 129 million in 1992, the third successive year to record a surplus. There was also significant progress towards fiscal consolidation with the budget deficit declining to 7.4 per cent of GDP in 1992 from 11.6 per cent in 1991. However, the year-on-year increase in money supply was 17 per cent in 1992 while the annual average increase of consumer prices was 11.4 per cent.",

In the international scene, there was lingering recession in many industrial countries which had a depressing impact on the demand for most primary commodities. On the domestic front, the prolonged drought that prevailed during the early part of the year caused agricultural production to decline. In this context, the 1992 growth performance, though moderate, underscores the strong resilience of the economy in the wake of the continued reforms and liberalisation efforts to promote economic growth and development.",

The manufacturing sector as a whole recorded a growth of 9 per cent in real terms following the growth rate of 6.8 per cent in 1991. Within the manufac\u00adturing sector, the value added in factory industry, the main component of which being the export-oriented textiles and garments industry, expanded by 13 per cent in real terms. The small industry sub-sector is estimated to have grown by 8 per cent in 1992. The continued dynamism of the manufacturing sector in determining Sri Lanka's growth performance in recent years, underscores the growing structural changes that had occurred in the economy in response to economic reforms and liberalisation measures.",

The export duties on these crops, having been revised downwards during the year, were completely abolished with effect from December 22, 1992. Considering the fact that historically these three plantation crops had been a major source of revenue to the government, the 1992 policy change of complete exemption from export duties no doubt marked a fundamental change in fiscal linkages within the domestic economy. It may be recalled that as late as 1978 export duties on plantation crops contributed as much as 40 per cent of the total tax revenue of the government. Its complete abolition in December, 1992 as a source of tax revenue to the government should be considered as the end of an era in which the plantation economy of Sri Lanka was inextricably linked to the government budget. Put differently, the December 1992 change marked the cessation of one of the most closest financial bonds that existed between the plantation economy and government finances in Sri Lanka. Thus, the great debate that had been continuing for several decades about the appropriateness or otherwise of taxing the plantation sector to defray government expenditure will now go on hold, at least for the time being.",

The decline in production was mainly reflected in a 22 per cent drop in output at Pelwatte, from 43,964 metric tons in 1991 to 34,217 metric tons in 1992 and a 7 per cent decrease in production at Kantalai, from 2,558 metric tons to 2,387 metric tons between the two years. In contrast, however, the production at Sevanagala rose by 27 per cent to 13,576 metric tons due mainly to a 57 per cent expansion in the extent harvested, while that at Hingurana increased marginally by 2 per cent to 9,520 metric tons. In 1992, the Sevanagala factory accounted for 23 per cent of the total sugar production in the country. The sharp decline in the output of Pelwatte was attributed to a substantial decrease of 27 per cent in the quantity of cane available for crushing in 1992 and was very largely due to a sharp drop in the quantity of cane supplied by private growers.",

Meanwhile, the services account too registered a significant improvement, the deficit declining from SDR 66 million to SDR 20 million between 1991 and 1992. These favourable developments together with increased net inflows on account of private transfers resulted in the current account deficit declining from SDR 352 million in 1991 to SDR 246 million in 1992.

The price decline was mainly due to depressed world market conditions and a deterioration in quality. Meanwhile, in sharp contrast to a drop of 18 per cent in 1991, the value of rubber exports rose marginally by 2 per cent, from SDR 47 million (Rs. 2,641 million) in 1991 to SDR 48 million (Rs. 2,960 million) in 1992.

In comparison, the average export price of rubber remained unchanged at SDR 0.61 per kg. over the two years. The continued recessionary conditions in most industrial countries, contributed to keep the the export price of rubber at depressed levels.

Meanwhile, the average export price per nut equivalent increased by 11 per cent to SDR 0.10 per nut in 1992.

The combined impact of these changes was a strengthening of the services account, which together with an improved trade account balance contributed to improve the country's balance of pay\u00adments position.",

One unfavourable development was a decline in non-monetary capital inflows which dropped by SDR 134 million or 28 per cent, from SDR 475 million in 1991 to SDR 341 million in 1992. The decrease was entirely reflected in capital inflows to the government which declined from SDR 486 million to SDR 297 million between the two years. Meanwhile, the amortisa\u00adtion payments on government debts, including settlement of a short-term interim loan of SDR 22 million taken in late 1991, increased from SDR 97 million in 1991 to SDR 146 million in 1992. Thus, on a net basis, capital inflows to the government in 1992 were only SDR 151 million, as compared to SDR 388 million in 1991. In sharp contrast to reduced flows to the government, the capital inflows to private sector continued to grow with greater vigour in 1992 with both direct investments and long-term loans recording considerable increases. Although portfolio investments decreased from SDR 24 million to SDR 18 million between 1991 and 1992, largely due to the depressed conditions in the Colombo Share Market, foreign direct investment in enterprises under the BOI as well as towards acquiring ownership in the recently privatised public enterprises increased from SDR 46 million to SDR 85 million between the two years.

Although the overall revenue effort was slightly weakened with a reduction in the revenue/GDP ratio from 20.4 per cent in 1991 to 20.3 per cent in 1992, a sharp fall in current expenditure coupled with a reduction in capital expenditure net of receipts under the privatisation programme, helped in containing the total expendi\u00adture/GDP ratio at 27.8 per cent in 1992 as compared with 32.1 per cent in the previous year. This was conducive to generating a reduced overall budget deficit of 7.4 per cent of GDP, a significantly lower ratio compared to 11.6 per cent recorded in 1991. This no doubt should constitute a major step towards fiscal sobriety vital for sustained economic expansion with stability.",

Tax revenue totalling Rs. 76,692 million accounted for 89 per cent of total revenue - almost the same level as in the previous year. Domestic taxes on goods and services continued to expand during the year generating 51 per cent of tax revenue as compared with 47 per cent in 1991. The increase in the range of products under excise tax and the imposition of a defence levy contributed to enhance revenue from this source. Meanwhile, import duties formed 27 per cent of total revenue in 1992. Conforming to the downward trend observed in recent years, the share of export duties further declined to 1.1 per cent of total tax revenue in 1992. In contrast, the share of income taxes in total tax revenue increased from 14.3 per cent in",

From the source side, the expansion in monetary base was entirely caused by a considerable build-up of net foreign assets (NFA) of the Central Bank amounting to Rs. 7,563 million. In contrast, the net domestic assets (NDA) of the Bank decreased by Rs. 2,760 million, thereby moderating the rate of growth of the monetary base during the year. The decline in the NDA was largely due to successful open market operations by the Bank. Meanwhile, refinance credit from the Central Bank recorded an increase of Rs. 419 million in 1992. Reflecting increased pressure for credit, the money multiplier, i.e. the ratio between the money supply and the monetary base, rose somewhat sharply to 2.91 by December, 1992 from 2.80 an year ago.",

Altogether, commercial bank credit to the CEB rose by Rs. 2,145 million during the year.

Following the increases of 49 and 50 branches in 1990 and 1991, respectively, a further 83 new bank branches were opened during 1992 thereby causing the banking density in the country to rise considerably. The latter included 48 branches established by commercial banks, 32 RRDB branches and 3 branches by the National Savings Bank. Following the pattern in the recent past, once again the domestic private commercial banks played the dominant role in expanding the bank branch network in the country. Altogether, 31 new bank branches were opened by domestic private commercial banks during 1992. These consisted of 15 branches by the Seylan Bank Ltd., 7 by Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd., 6 by Hatton National Bank Ltd., and 3 by the Sampath Bank Ltd. Meanwhile, the Bank of Ceylon opened 5 new bank branches while the People's Bank also opened 5 branches. A significant feature of bank branch expansion in 1992 was the expansion of the branch network of foreign commercial banks. In all, these banks opened 7 new branches consisting of 3 by the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd., 2 by the Standard Chartered Bank and 1 each by the ANZ Grindlays Bank pic and Public Bank Berhad. Thus, the developments in the bank branch network in 1992 were conducive for further reducing the dominant position of state sector banks in the commer\u00adcial banking system of the country. It was also reflective of the continuing thrust towards generating greater competition in the banking sector and the enhanced confidence of the international banking community in Sri Lanka's economic prospects.",

The decrease in the holdings of government and government guar\u00adanteed securities was purely on account of open market operations by the Bank. Although loans and advances to government increased by Rs. 2,685 million, a considerable portion of this was on account of a special loan to meet the obligations arising from the quota increase in the IMF effected during the year. Meanwhile, loans and advances to commer\u00adcial banks and other financial institutions increased by Rs. 419 million owing to continued refinance credit granted to finance companies during the year.

In view of continued efforts on the part of the Central Bank to siphon-off excess liquidity arising from the accumulation of external assets through open market operations, interest rates in the Treasury bills market moved upwards, particularly during the first 3 quarters of the year. Accordingly, the weighted average yield on Treasury bills with 3-months maturity increased from 16.33 per cent per annum at the end of 1991 to 18.33 per cent per annum in October, 1992 before declining to 17.70 per cent at the end of the year. Similarly, the yield on Treasury bills with maturity periods of 6-months and 12-months also increased from a range of 16.38 to 17.43 per cent per annum at the end of 1991 to 18.05 to 19.00 per cent per annum at the end of 1992. Reflecting these developments, the discount rates in the secondary market for Treasury bills also recorded increases during the year. Meanwhile, interest rates in the call money market continued to fluctuate in line with changes in short-term liquidity conditions in the market. Thus, call money rates which varied within a range of 13 - 27 per cent per annum at the end of 1991 recorded a wider range of 10 - 32 per cent per annum at the end of 1992. In line with the trends in the Treasury bills markets, interest rates on fixed deposits with short term maturities tended to remain high. The maximum interest rates on 3-months and 6-months deposits in commercial banks stood at 18.5 per cent, as compared with 18.5 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively, at the end of 1991. The maximum rate on 12-months deposits remained unchanged at 20 per cent. At the same time, maximum rates on deposits with maturities of 12 - 24 months also tended to remain high in a range of 20 - 21 per cent per annum. Meanwhile, the National Savings Bank (NSB) maintained its deposit rates at the previous year's levels. Thus, the rates offered on 12 and 24 months fixed deposits remained unchanged at 17 and 18.5 per cent, respectively, while the rate offered on savings deposits also remained unchanged at 14 per cent. With a view to reducing distortions in the interest rate structure, the Central Bank refinance rates appli\u00adcable to short term and MLCF facilities were also revised upwards in line with the movements in market rates to reflect the trends in the overall interest rates structure in the economy.",

In some others, sharp cut-backs on interest rates were observed in an attempt to push-start economic recovery following severe down-turns in economic activity involving heavy costs in terms of business failures and unemployment. This was against the background of relentless downward pressure on exchange rates, and, therefore, was suggestive of an abandonment of interest rate policy as an instrument to support domestic currency and macro-economic stability. Meanwhile, in yet others' the policy stance was exactly the opposite when the authorities continued to follow high interest rate policies as a counter-inflationary measure, no doubt with serious adverse implications both for growth and employment and much against domestic and international opinion. Thus, the signals emanating from the international scene on the interest rate front during 1992 were conflicting and devoid of any clear direction. In some instances, the directional changes were very confusing and almost questioned the conventional wisdom on the use of interest rate policy as an instrument in economic management.",

In other words, the general perception is that monetary policy can best contribute to economic development by achieving and maintaining price stability. In Sri Lanka, the annual rate of monetary expansion had been remaining at levels exceeding 20 per cent for the most part of 1992. Meanwhile, the inflation rate too tended to remain high almost closer to the levels prevailing in 1991. The major reason for the excessive growth in money supply had been a rapid build-up of external assets. Altogether, the country's net external banking assets rose by Rs. 6,453 million in 1992 far exceeding the increase anticipated at the beginning of the year. In order to siphon-off excess liquidity thus created by the expansion in external assets, the Central Bank was obliged to follow a tight monetary policy, a major plank of which being the high interest rate policy. The sterilization of excess liquidity necessitated that interest rates on Treasury bills remained high to facilitate the divesting of Treasury bills from the Central Bank's portfolio. This resulted in the entire interest rate structure remaining high. Thus, it was in order to reduce the rate of growth of money supply and to promote price stability that the interest rates had to remain high during 1992. Failure to maintain interest rates at high levels would have meant less success at open-market operations and, therefore, failure to sterilize excess liquidity being injected into the economy through the expansion in external assets with accompanying implica\u00adtions on monetary stability and the price level.",

The disposal of such a large volume of Treasury bills to non-Central Bank sources necessarily required that the yields were maintained at attractive levels.

It may be recalled that although there were signs of easing inflationary pressures, the rate remained above the 9.5 per cent level, on an year-on-year basis, throughout 1992 while the annual average rate*was 11.4 per cent. During periods when inflation is high, the public which undertakes savings are reluctant to invest in financial assets, because of the possibility of incurring losses on such savings, due to erosion of the value of money. During such periods, it is of paramount importance that interest rates are maintained at high levels, in order to ensure that savers receive a reasonable positive real rate of return. In such situations, if interest rates are allowed to drop to low levels, the savings momentum will be broken through a reduction in the public's demand for domestic financial assets and the country will be faced with serious investment and balance of payments problems. The reduction in the demand for financial assets would force the financial institutions to curtail their lending to productive sectors of the economy with implications on investment and growth.",

    "text": "A drop in the demand for domestic financial assets would also involve important implications for the balance of payments. In a small and relatively open economy like Sri Lanka, as the demand for domestic financial assets fall, there will be increased demand for foreign assets, leading to capital outflows. Large capital outflows, which would com\u00adpound the current account problems arising from reduced domestic savings, would force the country either to increase the amount of foreign borrowings or to draw on interna\u00adtional reserves, with continuing pressure on the exchange rate. Although there are restric\u00adtions on capital movements, capital outflows would continue through a variety of channels. On the contrary, what is required in the country at the present moment is a net capital inflow to supplement domestic savings for achieving development objectives.",

    "text": "Moreover, the level of interest rates can also have a bearing on the quantum of fixed investment out of a given volume of savings. When interest rates are low, relative to the prevailing rate of inflation, firms will find it profitable to borrow, not only for investment purposes but also as inflationary hedges, such as inventories, imported goods, real estate and foreign currency deposits. These additional demands for funds tend to \"crowd out\" financing for fixed investments.",

    "text": "A policy of maintaining interest rates that are low relative to the rates of inflation tends to lower the productivity of investment as well. First, in the face of limited amounts of financial savings forthcoming, administrative arrangements such as selective credit policies will have to be put in place to ration scarce financial resources, with accompany\u00ading inefficiencies in resource utilisation. Such credit rationing tends to reduce the necessity for careful evaluation of projects by enterprises and the economical use of resources in the implementation of these projects. Second, even in the absence of credit rationing, the resource allocation efficiency can get distorted as the well established firms would tend to be favoured over smaller or newer borrowers, without regard to the rates of return on the respective investments. Third, it would result in a bias in investment, in favour of capital intensive techniques, which will lead to high unemployment and social unrest.",

    "text": "It may also be pointed out that with negative or low real interest rates, the distribu\u00adtion of income and wealth can be in favour of the upper income groups in the country. Low income households and producers have little opportunity to invest their savings other than in financial assets, having at the same time limited access to credit from financial institutions. On the other hand, high income households and owners of large production units have a wider scope for borrowing funds as well as for placing their savings in a variety of investments, which act as inflation hedges.",

    "text": "The foregoing analysis would show that there was little room to follow a cheap money policy in Sri Lanka in 1992 in the context of macro-economic challenges facing the country, more particularly the continuing high rates of monetary expansion and the accompanying inflationary pressures. A policy stance other than a high interest rate policy would have compounded these problems, bringing in its wake financial repression and pressure on the balance of payments and the exchange rate. This is not to argue that for a developing country like Sri Lanka a high interest rate policy is imperative and is a panacea for all economic ills. What is stressed, however, is that given certain macro-economic conditions facing the country, a high interest rate policy is one which is likely to involve least economic damage.",
