    "text": "The year 1992 saw a significant strengthening of Sri Lanka's balance of payments position. While the deficit in the current account declined by SDR 106 million, the overall balance registered a surplus of SDR 129 million in 1992, following an overall surplus of SDR 152 million in the previous year. This reflected the combined impact of favourable responses to a number of policy actions, as well as an improvement in the terms of trade, which neutralised the adverse impact of the severe drought experienced during the early part of the year. A 20 per cent increase in export earnings in comparison to an 11 per cent expansion in import expenditure resulted in the trade deficit declining from SDR 726 million in 1991 to SDR 685 million in 1992. On the basis of provisional data the services account too registered a significant improvement, the deficit declining from SDR 66 million (Rs. 3,773 million) to SDR 20 million (Rs. 1,197 million) between 1991 and 1992. Provisional estimates indicate that net receipts from private transfers also increased from SDR 293 million (Rs. 16,623 million) in 1991 to SDR 330 million (Rs. 20,369 million) in 1992, while official transfers decreased from SDR 148 million to SDR 130 million between the two years.",

Accordingly, the current account deficit as a ratio of GDP, declined from 5.4 per cent to 3.6 per cent between the two years, which could be considered as a commendable achievement in the external sector of the economy in 1992.",

    "text": "Meanwhile, the capital account reflected mixed fortunes in marked contrast to the previous year. While the rising trend observed in private foreign capital inflows during the last two years, particularly foreign private direct investment, continued into 1992, net inflows of non-monetary capital to the government fell below expectations, due to heavy under-utilization of project aid and a spillover of an expected disbursement of a major program loan, viz. the second tranche of the Public Manufacturing Enterprises Adjust\u00adment Credit from the International Development Association, into 1993. Total net private foreign capital inflows, consisting of direct investments, portfolio investments, long-term loans and net short-term trade financing, increased from SDR 87 million (Rs. 5,062 million) in 1991 to SDR 190 million (Rs. 11,779 million) in 1992. Direct foreign private investment alone, rose by 85 per cent from SDR 46 million in 1991 to SDR 85 million in 1992. This, coupled with the associated private long-term capital flows, witnessed a fundamental strengthening of the capital account of the balance of payments. However, the inflows of non-monetary capital to the government declined by 36 per cent, from SDR 463 million to SDR 297 million between the two years. Despite these shortfalls in net non-monetary capital inflows, the balance of payments in 1992 registered an overall surplus of SDR 129 million, following an overall surplus of SDR 152 million in the previous year. Consequently, the country's gross external assets increased from SDR 809 million at the end of 1991 to SDR 1,047 million at the end of 1992. This level of gross reserves was sufficient to finance 4.7 months of imports projected for 1993. The corre\u00adsponding figure at end-1991 was 3.9 months of 1992 imports.",

Price increases in coconut and certain other agricultural export com\u00admodities, coupled with a 37 per cent rise in the value of industrial exports, totally over\u00adcame the impact of a marked decline in the volume of tea exports following a severe drought in the early part of the year. The 11 per cent increase in imports, from SDR 2,217 million (Rs. 125,631 million) to SDR 2,468 million (Rs. 152,407 million), was mainly due to an increase in outlays on intermediate, as well as investment goods in the form of heavy machinery and transportation equipment. This expansion in imports partly reflects the considerable liberalisation of exchange controls and easing of fiscal disincentives in the form of import duties and taxes, as well as the response to incentives provided to both foreign and local investors to encourage industrial production. The combined impact of all these factors resulted in significant improvements in the trade account between 1991 and 1992.",

At the same time, with the rise in foreign direct investment, repatriation of profits and dividends increased by the same amount, from SDR 14 million to SDR 22 million. With an SDR 5 million decline in interest payments to SDR 151 million, total outflows on account of investment income, at SDR 173 million, remained at around the same level as in the previous year. The combined impact of these changes was a strengthening of the services account, indicating that increased outflows on account of removal of restrictions was more than compensated for by the increased inflows.",

    "text": "As mentioned earlier, there was a further improvement in the transfers account in 1992 due to increased private remittances. Private transfer receipts rose from SDR 323 million in 1991 to SDR 385 million in 1992, reflecting a 19 per cent increase over the previous year's level. Meanwhile, relaxation of restrictions on the transfer of assets by non-resident Sri Lankans during the middle of the year led to a considerable increase in outflows from SDR 30 million to SDR 56 million between 1991 and 1992. However, the rise in inflows was more than sufficient to overcome the increased outflow and accord\u00adingly, the net inflow from private transfers expanded by 12 per cent, from SDR 293 million to SDR 330 million between the two years. This increase in inflows may be partly explained by the expansion in the stock of Sri Lankan labour abroad and the increased confidence of Sri Lankan workers overseas in the country's financial stability and attractive domestic interest rates. Official transfers are estimated to have declined from SDR 148 million to SDR 130 million between the two years. Despite this decrease, the transfers account showed an overall increase in net inflows, from SDR 441 million to SDR 459 million between 1991 and 1992.",

Non-monetary capital inflows recorded a decline of 28 per cent, from SDR 475 million to SDR 341 million between the two years. This decline was entirely due to a decrease in inflows in the form of both concessional and non-concessional assistance to the Government. Major inflows in this category continued to be from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (SDR 93 million), the International Development Association (IDA) (SDR 54 million) and Japan (SDR 41 million), a greater share of which were in the form of project loans. Meanwhile, amortization payments increased from SDR 97 million to SDR 124 million between the two years. In addition, the short-term interim loan of US dollars 30 million (SDR 22 million) towards part settlement of an Arbitration Award of US dollars 50 million in 1991 was repaid and replaced by a long-term loan guaranteed by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation of the U.S.A.",

While portfolio investment decreased from SDR 24 million to SDR 18 million between 1991 and 1992, foreign direct investment in enter\u00adprises under the BOI, as well as towards purchase of shares in the recently privatised public enterprises under the ongoing peoplisation program, increased from SDR 46 million to SDR 85 million between the two years. Meanwhile, there were inflows in the form of loans towards financing, and outflows in the form of progress payments, for Air Lanka's reflecting program in 1992. In addition, loan capital to enterprises under the BOI as well as foreign financing of infrastructural development in the Sri Lanka Telecom and the Urban Development Authority led to a significant increase in private long-term capi\u00adtal inflows from SDR 63 million in 1991 to SDR 110 million in 1992. Accordingly, there was a net inflow of private long-term capital of SDR 18 million in 1992, in contrast to a net outflow of SDR 18 million in 1991. The net utilisation of private short-term capital increased from SDR 35 million to SDR 69 million between 1991 and 1992. This increase in inflows was mainly due to the increase in short-term trade credits other than those of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.",

    "text": "The value of the Sri Lanka Rupee (SLR) fluctuated against all major currencies during 1992, with the exception of the US Dollar and the Japanese Yen. Thjs was partly a reflection of the currency crisis in Europe towards the latter part of the year, where certain European currencies, particularly the Pound Sterling, depreciated sharply against the US Dollar. In this climate,-while the SLR had depreciated throughout the year against the US dollar, the intervention currency, and the Japanese Yen, movements against the Pound Sterling, Deutsche Mark and French Franc first reflected a considerable depreciation upto August, followed by an appreciation through November, then recording a turnaround in these movements thereafter. The overall impact of these changes was a depreciation of the SLR from end-1991 to end-1992 against the Japanese Yen (8.4 per cent), US Dollar (7.4 percent), French Franc (2.3 per cent) and Deutsche Mark (1.9 per cent). Meanwhile, the SLR appreciated against the Pound Sterling by 14.6 per cent between end-1991 and end-1992. Accordingly, the SLR had depreciated against the SDR by 3.9 per cent between the two years. The SLR also reflected a depreciation of 6.7 per cent against the Indian Rupee during the period under review.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka's total outstanding external debt at the end of 1992 was estimated at SDR 5,029 million, showing an increase of SDR 427 million between end 1991 and end 1992. In contrast to the previous year, a large portion of this increase was reflected in the medium and long-term debt of the private sector, in particular, the enterprises coming under the BOI, including Air Lanka. Meanwhile, the medium and long-term debt of the government increased from SDR 3,594 million to SDR 3,844 million, mainly due to disbursements of concessional assistance from the ADB and IDA. With the release of two tranches under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement from the IMF, amounting to SDR 112 million, and the repayment of SDR 54 million of a loan taken earlier under the Compensatory Financing Facility for an export shortfall, outstand\u00ading debt to the IMF increased from SDR 280 million to SDR 338 million between end-1991 and end-1992. As mentioned earlier, the government's outstanding short-term loan of SDR 22 million was repaid and replaced by a medium-term loan of the same amount in March this year. Meanwhile, the outstanding level of all other short-term debt rose from SDR 329 million to SDR 399 million between end-1991 and end-1992. While outstanding short-term borrowings of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had remained at the same level as at end-1991, the higher borrowings were mainly due to an increase in import credits to BOI enterprises, and the short-term loans from FCBUs to exporters following the extension of the FCBU borrowing facility to non-BOI enterprises in 1991.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka's debt service payments which include amortization of medium and long-term loans and interest payments on all foreign loans, increased by SDR 23 million to SDR 379 million in 1992. This increase was entirely reflected in amortization payments. The entire rise in amortization payments was on account of repayments of non-IMF loans. While amortization payments had increased by SDR 28 million or 14 per cent to SDR 228 million, interest payments had declined by SDR 5 million or 3 per cent to SDR 151 million. Amortization payments of both the government and the private sector had increased over such payments in the previous year. The decline in interest payments entirely reflected a decrease in payments to the IMF. However, with the increase in earnings from the export of goods and services, the debt service ratio decreased from 18.5 per cent to 16.7 per cent between the two years. Debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from the export of goods, services and private transfers also decreased by well over 1 percentage point from 15.8 per cent to 14.3 per cent between the two years.",
