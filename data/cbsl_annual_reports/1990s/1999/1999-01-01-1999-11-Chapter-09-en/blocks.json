    "text": "Sri Lanka's export earnings began to improve in the latter part of 1999. During the fourth quarter of 1999, export earnings increased by 3 per cent. This is attributable to robust economic growth in the USA and European economies who were the major importers of textiles and garments. The recovery in the East Asian economies from the currency crisis and the appreciation of their currencies improved Sri Lanka's competitiveness in rubber based products and garments towards the end of 1999. Meanwhile, lower production in major producing countries and the recovery in the East Asian countries improved rubber prices. Tea prices, which had been falling since August 1998, also showed a recovery in the last two months of 1999 due to lower production in major tea producing countries and active participation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the Colombo market. Following the recovery in economies in East Asia and Japan, the demand for gems and jewelley increased.",

Export of textiles declined by 11 per cent, while other made up textile articles and yarn declined by 21 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. Garment exports, which accounted for 90 per cent of the total earnings from the textiles and garments sub-sector, reported a marginal improvement of 0.2 per cent. Net foreign exchange earnings from garments increased by 9 per cent due to lower prices of raw material and higher domestic value addition. As in the previous years, more than 90 per cent of textiles and garments were exported by Board of Investment (BOI) companies. Export earnings of BOI enterprises declined by 1 per cent in comparison to a 10 per cent growth in 1998. Non-BOI enterprises, whose exports declined by 4 per cent in 1998, faced a further decline of 7 per cent in 1999, partly reflecting the adverse impact of the East Asian currency crisis on small scale exporters who produce for the lower end of the market.

The majority of prawn farms had suspended prawn cultivation temporarily after August 1998 with the out-break of the 'Yellow Head' and 'White Spot' diseases. Although farms recovered from these diseases, due to heavy rains, no new cultivation took place to make any significant impact on exports. In the last quarter of 1998, the downfall of the industry started with some farmers resorting to improper practices to obtain a larger harvest. The Ministry of Aquatic Resources Development issued instructions to regulate the cultivation and processing to prevent future disasters of this nature and closely monitored the situation to ensure that farmers adhered to the guidelines. In addition to the financial assistance of Rs.50,000 per acre introduced in 1998, provided to cover 50 per cent of the pond area for modernisation of farms, a relief package to reduce the interest burden of bank borrowings and a scheme to share the risk of bank loans granted for procurement of shrimp feed equally with the banks was introduced for a limited period. Import of shrimp feed remained duty free as a relief measure. Earnings from lobster and crab exports increased by 28 per cent, while earnings from fresh, frozen and salted fish and animal fodder exports increased by 42 per cent in 1999. This was due to the steps taken under the assistance of the Swedish International Development Co-operation Agency to improve the quality of fish products to meet European market requirements. Among other food items, coconut milk and cream, canned fruits, sweets, various food preparations and sauces showed an improvement over the previous year.",

An increased demand for natural rubber, particularly from the USA, the Republic of Korea, China and the East Asian countries, and the production shortfall in major producing countries contributed to the improvement in prices. The increase in synthetic rubber prices in the wake of higher petroleum prices will also help in boosting natural rubber prices. In Sri Lanka, rubber production increased from 96 million kg in 1998 to 97 million kg in 1999. Local consumption of rubber remained around 54 million kg in 1999. In 1999, input quality requirements and attractive prices resulted in the import of 675,132 kg of natural rubber by the domestic manufacturing industry, compared to 259,869 kg in 1998.",

The lagged effect of the long drought, resulting from the El-Nino conditions, affected the major coconut producers, the Philippines and Indonesia, increasing the international prices of major coconut products. However, the price of coconut oil has continued to decline since July 1999 due to increased supply of relatively cheaper substitutes such as palm oil and the reduction of the export tax on palm oil from 30 per cent to 10 per cent in July 1999 in Malaysia. Palm oil prices in the world market decreased by 35 per cent from US dollars 671 per metric ton to US dollars 436 per metric ton, whereas coconut oil prices remained as high as US dollars 737 per metric ton in 1999.

    "text": "Owing to higher earnings from gems, the export of all mineral, products increased by 8 per cent. Mineral products contributed only about 2 per cent to the total export earnings in 1999. Gem exports, which suffered a major setback following the East Asian crisis and the subsequent depression in the Japanese market, have shown an improvement since April 1999, with higher exports to Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore. Well trained labour and the use of advanced technology assisted Sri Lanka's gem.cutting industry to maintain high standards, enabling Sri Lanka to attract the quality conscious US and European markets. France emerged as a major gem market with a high potential, while ; UK, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden continued to be the major buyers in the European market. Demand for'calibrated stones,'blue, pink and yellow sapphires showed :a steady growth, while green tourmaline, citrene and pink tourmaline continued to be in good demand. The entry of hew producing countries\" such as Tanzania, Vietnam and particularly,- Madagascar, which produces all gerri varieties found in Sri Lanka to the world market; has resulted in increased competition in this industry. Earnings from other mineral exports fell by 32 per cent due to lower earnings from natural graphite. However, earnings from metallic ores and iron.pyrites and ilmenite grew six fold, containing the overall decline in the mineral sector.",

Developments in infrastructure facilities, construction and the transport sector, combined with increased use of advanced technology, enhanced the imports of investment goods.

Textile imports, which were responsible for over 44 per cent of intermediate good imports, declined by 6 per cent attributable to lower prices. Although the volume of crude oil imports declined from 2,156 thousand metric tons to 1,832 thousand metric tons, the value of crude oil imports increased by 19 per cent as the average price rose from US dollars 13.47 per barrel to US dollars 19.06 per barrel. The reason for the lower volume of crude oil imports was the routine closure of the refinery for maintenance. Other petroleum products increased by 31 per cent, attributable to the higher volume imported to meet the additional demand resulting from the temporary closure of the refinery. Lower prices of fertiliser too contributed to the decline in imports. Diamond imports increased by 28 per cent, reflecting the recovery in the diamond and jewellery industries. Other intermediate goods imports dropped by 4 per cent, largely attributable to lower imports of inputs for the soap, garments, livestock food and rubber based manufacturing industries. However, reflecting the recovery in the industrial sector of the economy towards the last quarter of 1999, intermediate goods imports recorded a much higher growth rate of 11 per cent during the second half of 1999.",

During the year, imports of machinery and equipment, particularly in parts and accessories of industrial washing machines, telecommunications, tractors and construction related imports declined by 14 per cent.

The full year impact of the removal of the duty waiver on sugar and the introduction of a specific rate from 16 January 1998, resulted in significantly higher average duty rates in 1999. The relatively higher duty rate on rice was due to the partial duty waiver on rice, which was effective for the period of nearly 10 weeks from 22 November 1999, as against full duty waiver effective in January 1998. A reduction in the average duty rate on non-food consumer goods was indicated in respect of motor cars partly due to the partial duty waiver granted for public sector employees in the 1999 Budget.",

Accordingly, overall quota availability increased by 4 per cent in 1999. The overall quota utilisation rate increased from 74 per cent in 1998 to 80 per cent in 1999 particularly due to increased utilisation of the US quota. The utilisation of the US quota increased from 78 per cent in 1998 to 85 per cent in 1999. The utilisation of quotas varied widely across different categories and countries. The under utilisation was partly due to insufficient demand for particular items as local producers used their capacity to produce high value added garments under other quota categories or to produce non-quota garments. This was evidenced by the increased exports in the non-quota garment categories and full utilisation of some popular categories. Quota allocated for certain popular categories to the USA and the EU such as lady's dresses, shirts and blouses, dressing gowns, men's and boys' shirts, men's and women's trousers and men's shorts and breeches, terry and other pile towels and shop towels, were used almost in full while some items, such as the trousers and shirts categories, were over utilised. This was partly due to the use of forged documents for exports to the USA.",

After the full implementation exporters will receive this information directly at their offices. The TQB will be able to monitor quota utilisation right away and allocate the balance quota in a more efficient manner as all the information relating to utilisation of quota will be updated instantaneously.

Moreover, the rate of growth in arrivals was also the highest in the South Asian region. Gross earnings from the sector grew from US dollars 230 million in 1998 to US dollars 274 million in 1999. The absence of any major incidents to disturb the security situation outside the North and East during most of the year was a major reason for the increase in arrivals. Promotional campaigns carried out by the government and the private sector, and increased flying frequencies of SriLankan Airlines andother airlines between Colombo and major sources of tourist traffic to the country also contributed to this favourable development. The improved global economic conditions, particularly the recovery of East Asian countries including Japan; was also contributory to the influx of tourists to the country.",
