Dear Sir,

ADB LOAN NO. 1247 SRI (SF) SECONDARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (SEDP) PROCEDURE FOR IMPORTS

The Asian Development Bank (hereinafter referred to as ADB) has agreed to lend to the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, an amount equivalent to SDR 22,086,000 (Twenty Two Million Eighty Six Thousand) only for the Secondary Education Development Project. The proposed Project will be executed by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (hereinafter referred to as MEHE) who will utilize a part of the credit for the importation of equipment for the project. You are required to observe the following procedure in dealing with imports under this project.

2. All imports which must be from eligible source countries as shown in Annexure I, should be made against confirmed, irrevocable, without recourse Letters of Credit established by your bank on application made by MEHE. Every such Letter of Credit should contain the following clause:

"This Letter of Credit is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1247 SRI (SF) and becomes effective only if and when Asian Development Bank issues its commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank. For payment, please follow the instructions contained in the said commitment letter".

Even if the above mentioned clause is not incorporated in the Letter of Credit, it will immediately become operative on the strength of your bank's commitment to finance the transaction. However, the ADB's commitment if and when issued, will shift the financing commitment to the ADB. In such case, the Letter of Credit should contain the following clause :

"The financing of this Letter of Credit is undertaken by Bank of Ceylon, Metropolitan Branch, Colombo, Sri Lanka. However, it is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1247 SRI (SF), and if and when Asian Development Bank issues the commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank, the latter shall follow the instructions contained in the said commitment letter, and claim payment/reimburse­ment from Asian Development Bank".

Two copies of your Letter of Credit should be sent to MEHE who will arrange to have the ADB issue its formal letter of commitment to your bank's correspondent. If the ADB agrees to the MEHE's request it will issue a formal commitment letter to the designated commercial bank in the form shown in Annexure 2 to this letter.

3. (i) ADB's written approval is required for any amendments to the Letter of Credit involving :

(a) terms of payment including currency & amount of the Letter of Credit;

(b) the description or quantity of goods;

(c) the beneficiary;

(d) the country of origin; and

(e) extension of the expiry date of the Letter of Credit beyond the closing date i.e. 30th June, 1999 for withdrawal from the Loan Account.

Amendments not covered under (a) to (e) above do not require ADB's approval. Requests for approval of amendments mentioned above should be made promptly by the MEHE on the form shown in Annexure 3 to this letter accompanied by one copy of the amendment signed by you. The amendment of a Letter of Credit in such cases should include the following provision:-

"This amendment shall become effective when it is approved by ADB"

The ADB's approval, if given, will be communicated to your bank's correspondent as well as to the MEHE on the form shown in Annexure 4 to this letter.

(ii) The expiry date and the shipping date may be extended up to the closing date for withdrawal from the Loan Account without ADB's prior approval. When such extension has been made, MEHE should promptly inform ADB of such extension in the form shown in Annexure 3 to this letter attaching one copy of the extension duly signed by an authorized officer of your bank. Two copies of every amendment, whether subject to ADB's prior approval or not, should be sent by your bank to MEHE who will arrange, where necessary, for the ADB's approval to be issued.

4. On making payment to the beneficiary in terms of a Letter of Credit in respect of which a letter of commitment has been issued by the ADB, your bank's correspondent should forward the relevant documents to your bank and request reimbursement from ADB in the form shown in Annexure 5 of this letter. Your bank's correspondent should also forward a copy of the request for reimbursement to MEHE. In order to facilitate prompt disbursement, your bank's correspondent may send an authenticated SWIFT, telex or cable request to the ADB in the form shown in Annexure 6 to this letter. Arrangements should be made with the correspondent to advise your bank as expeditiously as possible about the receipt of reimbursement from ADB, and the shipping documents should be retained until confirmation of such reimbursement has been received. No Counterpart Funds are to be collected from the MEHE at the time of releasing the documents.

5. In case there is any discrepancy between the shipping documents and the terms of a Letter of Credit, the ADB will not be in a position to honour the payment claim. Neither will it be in a position to accept a Letter of Indemnity issued or endorsed by (Negotiating) commercial bank. In such an event, the negotiating commercial bank should seek through your bank the MEHE's authorization to make such payment despite any discrepancy.

The MEHE after authorizing the payment in consultation with your bank, should inform ADB by cable of the discrepancy and of the payment authorization given to the negotiating bank.

6. Where a commitment is issued by ADB in a currency other than the US dollar, the commitment letter will specify the US dollar equivalent determined on the basis of the exchange rate at which the ADB expects the non-US currency to become available for payment under such commitment. If in the case of any particular claim made by any of your bank's correspondents in a non-US currency, the US dollar equivalent exceeds the amount available under ADB's commitment, ADB will limit the reimbursement to the non-US currency equivalent of such US dollar amount available. If for this reason or for any other reason whatsoever, ADB declines to reimburse your bank's correspondent in full or in part in respect of a claim made in terms of your Letter of Credit, your bank may remit to your bank's correspondent the amount disallowed by the ADB. You should make necessary arrangements for this purpose with MEHE.

iii

7. The Controller of Exchange will advise your bank regarding Exchange Control requirements in this connection.

8. All your bank's charges should be for account of MEHE.

5. The negotiating bank should be advised to furnish copies of all amendments made to each Letter of Credit to IDA which will provide its written approval for amendments involving :-

(a) the value of the Letter of Credit;

(b) the description or quantity of goods;

(c) the beneficiary; and

(d) any extension of the expiry date of the Letter of Credit more than six months beyond the original date or beyond the date quoted in the special commitment issued by IDA.

No other amendments require IDA's prior approval.

6. Since the captioned line of credit is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDR), the IDA will specify the SDR commitment in its Special Commitment Letter to the negotiating bank in respect of Letters of Credit expressed in another currency. If due to this limitation of its commitment, IDA does not reimburse the full amount of the foreign currency to your correspondent abroad as specified in the Letter of Credit,

xvi

you may remit the balance due to the negotiating bank in accordance with the instructions issued to you in this regard by the Controller of Exchange.

7. Importers under this credit are not required to pay the rupee value of the shipping documents involved to the Government's Counterpart Fund Account. You may therefore, release such documents to your customers no sooner they are received by you after recovering commissions, charges etc., if any, due to your bank or to the negotiating bank.

8. Copies of Letter of Credit and amendments, if any, should be forwarded to the Chief Accountant, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Colombo, for information.

9. Controller of Exchange will advise you separately of his requirements in this connection.

Yours faithfully,

M. B. Dissanayake Chief Accountant

c.c. 1. Controller of Exchange

2. Project Director,

Mahaweli Restructuring and Rehabilitation Project, 2nd Floor, 500, T. B. Jayah Mawatha, Colombo 10.

Circular No. :BS/62/97

PUBLIC DISCLOSURE BY PUBLICATION OF BANK ACCOUNTS IN THE PRESS

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka in keeping with international banking standards for greater transparency and market discipline, has decided to introduce certain disclosure requirements which would improve the market's ability to make well-informed decisions as a means of promoting a sound and efficient banking system in Sri Lanka.

In this connection, your attention is invited to the agreement on the format for disclosure by all LCBs. All LCBs are, therefore, informed that the publication of Bank accounts on a half-yearly and annual basis should be made in the press as per details in Annex I and II of the agreed format attached, and such publication should commence with the Audited Accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1998. In the case of banks whose financial year is a date other than 31st December, 1998, they are required to commence the publication with the half-year accounts falling due after 1st January, 1999.

With regard to the medium of publication, the Banks may initially publish the financial information in the daily English Newspapers. The date for the publication in Sinhala and Tamil would be intimated to the LCBs in due course.

In view of the heterogeneous character of group accounts of foreign banks, all foreign banks are requested to make every endeavour to publish all items given in the agreed format. The global financial information may be reported in the currency of the home country or in U.S. Dollars.

Please acknowledge receipt of this Circular.

4. Measures to be taken by Licensed Specialised Banks

The Monetary Board has directed, in terms of Section 76 J of the Banking Act, that Licensed Specialised Banks too shall comply with the requirements stipulated in paragraphs 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) in respect of all customers' accounts maintained by them, and paragraph 3(d).

5. Measures to be taken by Registered Finance Companies

7. General

Licensed Commercial Banks, Licensed Specialised Banks and Registered Finance Companies are requested to declare in a newspaper advertisement in all three languages that their respective institutions are Year 2000 ready. The term "Year 2000 ready" would mean that they have taken all reasonable measures to prevent a disruption of their activities in the transition to the Year 2000, primarily arising from electronic and computer related problems. The declaration of an institution's status in this manner would help establish public confidence in that institution and discourage speculation. These advertisements may contain a disclaimer of liability should there be any malfunction or disruption at the time of the roll­over to the new Millennium.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS AS AT

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

1.1 GENERAL

1.1.1 Accounting Convention

The Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss Account and Cash Flow Statement are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLAS) laid down by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL) applied consistently on a historical cost/modified historic cost basis. Where appropriate, the policies are explained in the succeeding notes.

1.1.2 Basis of Consolidation

(a) The Group Financial Statements include the consolidated results, assets and liabilities of the Bank and its subsidiaries and associates made upto their respective financial year ends. The interests of outside shareholders of the subsidiaries in the net assets, and their proportion of the results are grouped separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account respectively, under the heading minority interests. (SLAS.26)

(b) In the Group Financial Statements, investments in associate companies are accounted for on the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting the Group's share of profits and losses of the investee companies is accounted for in the Consolidated Profit and Loss account for the year. The carrying value of the investment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is thereby increased or decreased to recognise the Group's share of retained profits and losses of the investee companies since the date of acquisition. (SLAS 27)

1.1.3 Foreign Currency Translation (SLAS 21)

(a) Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the middle rate of exchange ruling on the date of the Balance Sheet except as indicated in (b) below. Translation gains and losses are dealt with through the Profit & Loss Account.

(b) Forward exchange contracts are valued at the forward market rates ruling on the date of the Balance Sheet. Unrealized losses are dealt with through the Profit & Loss Account whereas unrealized gains are deferred in other liabilities.

1.1.4 Taxation

Provision for taxation is made on the basis of the profit for the year as adjusted for taxation purposes in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979 and amendments thereto.

1.1.5 Deferred Taxation

Deferred taxation is provided on the basis of tax effect accounting using the liability/deferral (whichever is applicable) method and the balance of the Deferred Taxation Account represents income tax applicable to the difference between the written down values for tax purposes of the assets on which depreciation allowances are claimed and the net book value of such assets. Partial application method cannot be used as it is against the matching and prudence concept.

1.2 Assets and Bases of their Valuation

1.2.1 Advances to Customers

(a) Advances to customers are stated in the Balance Sheet net of provisions for possible loan losses and also net of interest which is not accrued to revenue.

(b) Specific provisions for possible loan losses are based on a continuous review of all advances in accordance with CBSL directions. (Briefly summarise the CBSL requirements).

(c) State the policy for general provisioning.

1.2.2 Investments (SLAS 22)

Specify the accounting policy followed on valuation of dealing and investment securities.

1.2.3 Fixed Assets (SLAS 18)

(a) Fixed Assets are recorded at cost or valuation together with any incidental expenses thereon. The assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation which is provided for on the basis specified in (6) below.

(b) Depreciation is provided at the following rates on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of different types of assets.

Leasehold Properties Over the period of lease

Buildings

Motor Vehicles

Computer Equipment

Office Equipment, Furniture & Fittings

Full depreciation is provided on the assets purchased and used during the year.

1.3 Liabilities and Provisions

1.3.1 Commitments & Contingencies

All discernible risks are accounted for in determining the amount of other liabilities.

1.3.2 Pensions and Retirement Benefits (SLAS 16)

The bank has a non-contributory pension scheme for the members of the staff. The bank's policy is to fund the pension reserve annually from post tax profits by appropriating a sum which, in the management's opinion, is sufficient to meet future pension commitments. An actuarial valuation, at least every five years, is undertaken to ascertain the full liability and any shortfall of the pension fund would be adjusted accordingly.

OR

The bank operates an approved pension fund for the payment of pensions and monthly contributions are made to the pension fund based on a percentage of the gross emoluments excluding certain allowances. The percentage of contributions was determined by an independent actuary and retirement benefits are provided for all members of the permanent staff.

OR

Provisions are not made in the accounts for gratuities to employees, who complete 5 or more years of continuous service, payable under the payment of Gratuities Act, No. 12 of 1983, as the bank has its own non-contributory pension scheme in force.

1.4 Profit and Loss Account

1.4.1 Revenue Recognition

Interest Income

Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis. Interest ceases to be taken into revenue when the recovery of interest or principal is in arrears for over three (3) months. Thereafter, interest on advances is accounted for on a cash basis.

Lease Income

All leases are financial leases. As such, the income recognised is the interest component of the lease rentals receivable during the year.

The excesses of aggregate rentals receivable over the cost of the leased asset constitutes the total unearned income. The unearned income is taken into revenue over the term of the lease, commencing from the month in which the lease is executed, in proportion to the remaining balance of the lease.

1.4.2 Losses on Dealing & Investment Securities

Fall in value of dealing & investment securities, whether temporary or permanent, should be routed through the P&L A/c. Charging diminution in value of securities direct to reserves lacks transparency, specially for a deposit taking institution such as a bank and results in the loss of credibility of the P&L A/c as a measure of management performance.

1.4.3 Terminal Benefits - SLAS 16

Pension costs are charged to the Profit and Loss Account in the year in which such costs are determined.

The actual amounts paid as pensions and retirement gratuities are charged to the Pension Fund.

1.4.4 Extraordinary Items - SLAS 10

Extraordinary items are those derived from events or transactions outside the ordinary course of business and which are material and are not expected to recur frequently or regularly.

Operating Instructions to Authorised Dealers

Dear Sirs,

MONITORING SCHEME ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE DRAWING AGAINST

INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC CREIDT. DEBIT OR ANY OTHER

FUND TRANSFER CARDS

With the development of electronic fund transfer systems (EFTS), the number of Credit Cards, Debit

Cards and other Electronic Fund Transfer Cards (EFTCs) with global access, issued to residents of Sri Lanka

by Authorised Dealers for making payments abroad in foreign exchange has increased substantially.

Therefore, the introduction of a monitoring system has become necessary to ascertain the nature of payments

made through EFTCs, as in the case of release of foreign exchange for travel abroad.

2. Authorised Dealers are permitted to release foreign exchange for payments in respect of expenditure

incurred abroad using EFTCs, only for personal expenses such as travel expenses, hotel charges, incidental

expenses, medical expenses and purchase of goods for personal use. EFTCs are not permitted to be utilised

for payments in respect of capital transactions and purchase/import of goods in commercial quantities.

3. In order to facilitate monitoring of expenditure incurred by the use of EFTCs abroad, Authorised

Dealers are required to follow the under-mentioned procedure when issuing EFTCs, which could be used

abroad.

3.1 EFTCs should be issued only to residents of Sri Lanka.

3.2 Authorised Dealers should obtain a written undertaking from the applicant for a EFTC on Form 3

(a specimen of which is at Annex 1) to the effect that the foreign exchange drawings/payments on

the card will be only for authorised purposes as set out in para 2 above before issuing the EFTCs.

3.3 Authorised Dealers should forward the original of duly completed Form 3 to the "Monitoring

Unit" of the Exchange Control Department on a daily basis, retaining a copy with them.

3.4 If the cardholder leaves the country either for good or for employment abroad, the card issued to

him/her should be surrendered to the Authorised Dealer as per declaration in Form 3.

3.5 Authorised Dealers should incorporate the conditions at para 3.2 and 3.4 above in the agreement

that the cardholder enters into with the Authorised Dealer, or in the conditions for the use of the

card at the time of issue.

3.6 The above procedure should be effective for issue of new EFTCs as well as for renewal of EFTCs

already issued.

4. Periodic Statements to Exchange Control Department

4.1 Authorised Dealers should keep accounts for each cardholder in respect of expenditure incurred in

foreign exchange abroad segregated from the expenditure incurred in Sri Lanka.

4.2 A monthly report (a specimen of which is at Annex II) containing information on cardholders who

have incurred expenditure in foreign exchange exceeding US $ 5,000 or its equivalent in any other

foreign currency, in any one month, should be forwarded to reach the undersigned marked

'Attention Monitoring Unit' not later than the 15th day of the following month. This Report should be signed by a responsible officer of the bank.

TREASURY BILL GUIDELINES NO. 2

1. Effective from 20th October, 1999 at primary auctions, Treasury Bills will be issued with 91 days, 182 days and 364 days of day counts to maturity instead of three month, six month and twelve month Treasury Bills which were issued hitherto.

2. Primary Dealers are advised to price their bids submitted at primary auctions accordingly. Treasury Bills which have been issued to-date with 3 month, 6 month and 12 month maturities will remain with such maturities with which they were issued prior to 20th October, 1999 until such time such Treasury Bills mature and are repaid.

3. With the change outlined in (1) above, the day count used on Actual/Actual basis at primary auctions of Treasury Bills will be done away with. In order to be enable to maintain a uniform practice in the market, Primary Dealers are expected to comply with the day count base of 364 days. The formula for secondary market transactions would be Actual/364 days.

4. Through the new formula for day counts is effective from 19th October, 1999, Primary Dealers may comply with the new day count requirement with regard to secondary market transaction involving Treasury Bills that were issued prior to this effective date with 3 month, 6 month and 12 month maturities. This would bring about uniformity with regard to day count without any time lag.

5. In the event of bank holidays falling on maturity dates of Treasury Bills, as is the current practice, the settlement dates will be the working days preceding such maturity dates.
