Government savings are expected to rise to 4 per cent of GDP in 2002. The improvement in the medium-term fiscal outlook is expected through fiscal adjustment measures aimed at raising revenue elasticity, containing the growth of current expenditure and prudent cash management.

    "text": "The government's strategy for developing information technology and the industrial and construction sectors was further strengthened in 1999. Information technology has been one of the major thrust areas showing rapid expansion in recent years. There is also high employment growth potential in this sector. A special fiscal incentive package was granted to those involved in the training of software specialists. Further, steps are being taken to upgrade the existing network of technical and vocational training centres and also to set up an Institute of Information Technology. Meanwhile, fiscal incentive packages granted for regional industrialization and for advanced technology development, scheduled to terminate in early 1999, were extended considering the need for further support for these sectors. In order to encourage private sector participation in the provision of training facilities, institutes which conduct training in priority sectors (garments, gems, jewellery, electronic and computer software) and engage in productivity improvement were granted 5 year tax holidays. Imports of machinery and equipment for the construction industry were made duty free, while income tax on local contractors was reduced from 35 per cent to 15 per cent, in line with the tax concessions enjoyed by foreign contractors.' The government in 1999 established a Construction Industry Guarantee Fund with a view to reducing the cost of securities such as bid bonds and performance bonds required to be furnished by contractors.",

The revenue generation of most government departments and agencies through the sale of their goods and services has not been sufficient due to low prices. Therefore, the government decided to increase all government fees and charges on public services by 20 per cent, while postal charges were increased by 40 per cent. Revisions in postal rates in the recent past have contributed towards lowering the operational loss of the Postal Department. Although Sri Lanka Railways incurs a similar loss on its current operations, the envisaged upward revision of fares could not be made. An unchanged fare structure since 1996, operational shortcomings and high recurrent expenditure are the main causes hampering an improvement in the railway service. However, fare increases alone would not solve the multifaceted problems in the Railways Department. A comprehensive reform programme should be initiated to improve the rail service in the country.",

Accordingly, about 70 per cent of total net domestic borrowings was through Treasury bonds in 1999. The maturity structure of bonds was increased to 6 years from 4 years in 1998.

The electronic bidding system, which was introduced on a trial basis in 1998, commenced operations in 1999. This system was also used to release results of primary auctions to primary dealers. In line with international practice, a day count basis was introduced for Treasury bills to improve primary issues and trading in the secondary market. Accordingly, Treasury bills were issued with maturities of 91 days, 182 days and 364 days in place of 3 months, 6 months and 12 months respectively. Preparatory work has been completed to introduce a scripless system - a long-felt need to activate secondary market operations for government debt securities. Another major step taken to improve domestic debt management and open market operations was the reform of the Monetary Operations Unit (MOU). The MOU was replaced by three committees; the Liquidity Assessment Committee (LAC), the Open Market Operations Committee (OMOC) and the Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC) in 1999. The main responsibilities assigned to these committees include the assessment of liquidity in the market, assessing the need for Central Bank intervention in the market and determining the value, composition and the",

There is still room for improvement in debt market activities in areas such as regionalisation of activities, moving towards a fully scripless system, trading of government securities at the stock exchange, introducing a system for the surveillance of public debt and allowing foreign investors to enter the government securities market.

Income tax revenue, which has been virtually stagnant in the recent past, increased by 38 per cent to Rs.28,228 million in 1999. Personal income taxes increased by 13 per cent to Rs.9,169 million, while corporate taxes increased sharply by 56 per cent to Rs. 18,362 million. Despite the slower growth in the economy in 1999 compared to 1998, the reduction of the corporate tax rate on sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism and construction to 15 per cent in the 1999 Budget and the continuation of the investment tax allowance and other tax incentives announced in earlier budgets, the corporate tax revenue increased sharply mainly due to higher income tax payments by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (Rs. 3,405 million) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (Rs 3,410 million). Meanwhile, improved tax administration brought a collection of Rs.3,895 million as additional assessments on account of income taxes.

While GST revenue from the manufacturing sector brought in Rs. 10,552 million, collections from non-manufacturing sources amounted to Rs.9,192 million. The bulk of GST revenue on manufactures was derived from the food, beverage and tobacco sub-sector. Major contributors to this sub-sector were the tobacco and liquor industries. The chemical and petroleum sector also contributed to GST revenue from manufacturing sources. GST revenue from the non-manufacturing sector was obtained mainly from services such as construction, electricity and insurance, reflecting the higher growth in these sectors in the economy.",

The change in the refund mechanism enhanced the import GST revenue collection in net terms by reducing leakages through this mechanism. Thus, GST refunds as a percentage of gross receipts averaged at 16.7 per cent during the latter half of 1999 as compared to an average of 30.2 per cent witnessed for the first six months of 1999. In addition, audit checks were also intensified during the latter part of 1999 in order to improve GST compliance. Therefore, GST revenue in net terms on account of imports during the second half of 1999 increased by 14 per cent to Rs.8,921 million in comparison to Rs.7,841 million during the comparable period in 1998.",

The introduction of GST at a lower rate of 12.5 per cent as opposed to a tax structure of 8,12 and 18 per cent levied under turnover taxes prior to its abolition can be cited as a major reason for the reduced collection of GST vis-a-vis turnover taxes.

Consequently, expenditure on goods and services as a percentage of GDP fell substantially from 4.3 per cent in 1998 to 3:6 per cent in 1999. The significant decline in outlays for the purchase of defence goods and services by 14 per cent enabled this category of expenditure to show a substantial reduction. Thus, purchases of defence goods and services, which in 1998 amounted to Rs.27,958 million, decreased to Rs.23,848 million in 1999, consequently lowering the share of such outlays in GDP terms to 2.1 per cent in 1999 from 2.8 per cent in the preceding year. A tight control on cash releases to defence services, whereby Treasury approval had to be sought for withdrawals made from the banking sector, and lower imports for defence purposes contributed largely towards curtailing expenditure from this source. Similarly, outlays for the purchase of goods and services for ministries and departments at Rs. 13,730 million registered a marginal",

As a share of total transfers and subsidies, transfers to public corporations and institutions rose to 17 per cent in 1999 from 15 per cent in the previous year. Major users of such public funds continued to be the Samurdhi Authority (Rs.938 million) and the Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital (Rs.328 million). While operational losses of the Postal Department decreased to Rs.212 million as a result of the 40 per cent increase in postal rates in November 1998, operational losses of Sri Lanka Railways rose to Rs. 1,848 million in 1999. Of this, Rs.326 million was incurred to clear arrears to the CPC and Rs 150 million to settle salary arrears. The continuation of such losses in the postal and railway departments points to the urgent need for price revisions and the adoption of a comprehensive reform plan to improve the efficiency of these enterprises.",

In nominal terms, higher public investment was observed largely in government institutions, corporations and provincial councils while investments made by ministries and departments grew at a slower pace. Accordingly, government direct transfers to institutions, corporations and other levels of government registered a sharp increase of 25 per cent, while transfers to ministries and departments rose only by 1 per cent in 1999.

In 1999, Central Bank intervention in the primary Treasury bill market was significantly higher than in 1998, as the Central Bank bought more bills towards the latter half of the year to ease the pressure on interest rates due to additional demand for liquidity as a result of Y2K uncertainty. Holdings of Treasury bills by the banking sector increased to Rs 40,155 million while more than half of these were held by the Central Bank. As a percentage of the total Treasury bills stock, the banking sector holdings increased to 32 per cent from 20.per cent in 1998.",

As a ratio of GDP, the foreign debt stock increased marginally to 46 per cent. The appreciation of the Japanese yen against the rupee by 20 per cent in 1999 largely contributed to the increase in the external debt stock. Project loans increased by 11 per cent to Rs.444,423 million while non-project loans increased by 4 per cent to Rs. 63,443 million. Japan, with gross disbursements of Rs. 10,424 million, continued to be the largest bilateral source for project loans followed by multilateral sources such as the ADB and IDA with gross disbursements of Rs.6,695 million and Rs.3,579 million, respectively, in 1999. The outstanding stock of non-project loans in the form of cash, commodity and other types increased only due to exchange rate variations.",

The SDR denominated debt remained at around 38 per cent of the total foreign debt stock. Loans denominated in these three currencies represent about 90 per cent of the total foreign debt stock.
