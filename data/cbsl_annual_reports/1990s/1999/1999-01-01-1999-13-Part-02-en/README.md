Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

Accounts and Banking Operations

Accounts

The total assets/liabilities of the Central Bank as at the end of 1999 stood at Rs.200,586 million registering an increase of 6.3 per cent over the previous year. The international reserves continued to be the largest single asset category of the Bank, although its relative position declined from 67.4 per cent in 1998 to 54.4 per cent. The main contributory factors for this decline in the international reserves were the repayment of foreign public debt, payments to the International Monetary Fund and the net sales of foreign exchange to commercial banks by the Central Bank.

Meanwhile, the domestic assets of the Bank have shown an increase of 54.7 per cent during the year from Rs.40,465 million as at end of 1998 to Rs.62,598 million as at end of 1999. This was mainly due to the increase in the Treasury bills holding of the Bank as a part of its Open Market Operations implemented with a view to reduce the tightness of rupee liquidity associated with Y2K concerns and the end-year seasonal factors. The medium and long-term credit facilities granted to commercial banks and other credit institutions, on the other hand, declined by 32.9 per cent in 1999, partly due to repayments of such loans and partly due to the provisions made for non-performing loans. Short-term advances to commercial banks also declined by 51.2 per cent in 1999.'

On the liability side, currency in circulation, which was the largest category of liabilities increased by 16.8 per cent to Rs.70,210 million from Rs.60,087 million due to seasonal demand and Y2K related issues. Deposits accounted for 30.7 per cent of the total liabilities of the Bank during the year. Within this category, the deposits held by the government decreased by 20.7 per cent, while the deposits maintained by commercial banks under the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR), on their deposit liabilities with the Central Bank declined by 7.7 per cent due to the reduction of the SRR. Deposits of international organizations, foreign governments and foreign banking institutions declined by 4.0 per cent. A comparison of major components of assets and liabilities of the Bank is shown in Table II—2.

The total gross income of the Bank for the year 1999 was Rs. 18,675 million compared with Rs. 17,897 million in 1998. Around 71 per cent of the income of the Bank was generated through the management of foreign reserves of the Bank, while interest earned from domestic sources accounted for about 29.4 per cent. The 'asset-turnover ratio' i.e. total income as a percentage of average total assets, which reflects the operating efficiency of the Bank, continued to remain around 9.6 per cent during 1999.

T The Balance Sheet of the Central Bank as at 31 December, 1999 together with the Profit and Loss Account of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 1999 is presented in Table 11-1.

The gross expenditure of the Bank also increased to

Rs. 15,475 million from Rs. 14,897 million in 1998. Of this amount, 14.2 per cent was on account of administrative expenditure, while 68.4 per cent had been for interest payments. After making allowances for expenditure, allocation to reserves, provisions for depreciation, bad debts etc., the balance net profit of Rs.3,200 million was earmarked to be applied in liquidation of any outstanding government obligations to the Central Bank or be paid and credited to the Consolidated Fund of the government in terms of Section 39(c) of the Monetary Law Act.

Part II' Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

The total rupee value of foreign exchange purchased by

the Bank from the LCBs during the year amounted to Rs.28

million compared' with Rs.3,845 million during the previous

year, while the sales of foreignexchange amounted to Rs;4,018

million as against Rs. 13,695 million during. 1998.

The Central Bank invested its foreign exchange reserves

in fixed income assets denominated in five major currencies

and in1 short-term money markets in nine currencies.

Open Market Operations

The sale (discounting) of Treasury bills at the secondary

window of the Central Bank amounted to Rs.6<982 million in

1999 compared with Rs.11,934 million in the preceding year.

This drop of Rs.4,952 million or 42 per cent was mainly due

to the tight liquidity situation, particularly during the latter part

of the year under review.

The purchase (re-discounting) of Treasury bills by the

Central Bank also decreased significantly from Rs. 14,969

million in 1998 to Rs. 1,443 million in 1999 or by 90 per cent,

as LCB and non commercial bank primary dealers could meet

their immediate cash requirement by borrowing against

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds under the reverse repo

facility of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The total value of

transactions through the reverse repo facility providedby the

Bank during 1999 amounted to Rs.l37,829 million compared

with Rs. 1,446 million in 1998.

The Central Bank's secondary market yield rates moved

in line with trends witnessed in the primary market yield rates

during the year. The yield rates on 3-month and 6-month

Treasury bills in the secondary window of the Central Bank

decreased from 11.86 per cent and 12.19-per cent, at the

beginning of the year to 11.57 per cent and112.09 per cent,

respectively, at the end of the year. The rates on 12-month

Treasury bills increased marginally from 12.39 per cent to 12.54

percent during the year, with the increase in the yield rates of

12-month Treasury bills from 12.54 per cent to 12.69 per cent

at the primary auctions over the same period.

Repurchase Market (Repo)

The total volume of Treasury bills sold under repurchase

agreements during the year declined from Rs.728,757 million

during 1998 to Rs.307,795 million (by 58 per cent) during

1999, indicating a significant drop in the market's excess

liquidity.

The overnight Repo rate, which was 11.0 per cent at the

beginning of the year, was gradually reduced to 9.25 per cent

towards the end of the year. The continued decline in inflation

and the drop in the primary Treasury bill market yields have

enabled the Central Bank to reduce the Repo rate. This was

another reason for reduction in the volume of transactions under

repurchase agreements by LCBs and non-bank primary dealers

with the Central Bank during 1999.

- : • i

Reverse Repurchase Market

In 1999, the Reverse Repo transactions of the Central Bank

amounted to Rs. 137,829 million against Treasury bills and

Rs.75,520 million against Treasury bonds. On December 21

1999, the Central Bank extended the tenor of reverse repo

facility, on a temporary basis, from overnight up to 30 days

with the intention of easing the expected tight liquidity situation5

due to Y2K related problems.

Bank Rate

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank Rate) on short-term

advances to LCBs stipulated under Section 87 of the Monetary

Law Act was reduced from 17 per cent to 16 per cent with

effect from 13 August 1999:

Short-Term Credit

LCBs which provided a roll-over credit facility to-farmer

borrowers prior to the termination of the New Comprehensive

Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) with effect from April 1994

were granted a refinance facility only on the roll-over amount.

The outstanding amount under this facility at the end of 1999

amounted* to Rs. 12 million compared with Rs.23 million at the

end of 1998.

Medium and Long-Term Credit

The Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund (MIXT) remained

unchanged at Rs.4,925 million during 1999. The amount repaid

during the year stood at Rs. 145 million, while there was a

disbursement of Rs.4-1 million to the People's Bank under the

Finance Companies Act, No. 78 of 1988. Thus, the total amount

of outstanding credit released from the MLCF before the

provision forbad debts was Rs.2,605 million at the end of 1999;

Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR)

The SRR against the deposit liabilities of LCBs, both rupee and

foreign currency deposits, was reduced from 12 per cent to 11

per cent with effect from 20 August 1999.

Foreign Currency Loan Facility to Non-BOI Exporters

This scheme introduced in 1997, in order to extend comparatively low cost credit facilities to Non-BOI exporters, continued to be implemented during 1999. Total loans granted during the year 1999 through both the Domestic Banking Units" (DBUs) and Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) under the scheme amounted to US dollars 124 million, compared with US dollars 177 million granted in 1998. This was a drop of 30 per cent. Lending through the DBUs dropped-from US dollars-166 million in 1998 to US dollars 119 million in 1999, while through the FCBUs it dropped from US dollars-11-5 million in 1998 to US dollars 4.75 million in 1999. Almost all the loans were granted with a maturity period of less than one year. At the end of 1999, the outstanding amount of loans granted under

( V )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

the scheme was US dollars 35 million. These loans were provided at interest rates ranging between 6.00 per cent and 10.50 per cent (Table II-4).

Use of the facility by the Non-BOI enterprises in 1999 declined by more than 50 per cent compared with 1997. The main factor.attributed to this sharp drop appears to be the deceleration of the domestic interest rates.

Subsidy and Ex-gratia Payments to Indian Repatriates

Total subsidy payments made on behalf of the government to repatriated estate workers of Indian origin under the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of 1964 amounted to Rs:73^750 in 1999 compared, with Rs.148,231 in 1998. Ex-gratia payments amounted to Rs.3,300 in 1999-compared with Rs.l5,675 in 1998.

Import Duty Rebate to Exporters

The Bank reimbursed a total sum of Rs.349 million in 1999 to LCBs in respect of import duty rebates paid to exporters on behalf of the government, compared with Rs.768 million in 1998.

Asian Clearing Union

The total value of the transactions routed through the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) in-1999 amounted to Rs.42,724 million compared with Rs.44,240 million during the previous year. The rupee value of the net settlements made in foreign currency in 1999 amounted to Rs.36,685 million compared with Rs.34,257 million in 1998.

Compulsory Savings Fund

The Central Bank continued to be the custodian of the monies collected under the Compulsory Savings Act, No. 6 of

1971 and the Ceiling on Income and Compulsory Savings Law, No. 15 of 1972, and continued to administer the compulsory savings fund on behalf of the government. As at 31 December 1999, there was a balance of Rs.63 million in the Fund maintained with the Bank.

Government Accounts

As banker to the government, the Central Bank continued to maintain accounts of government departments, government agencies and institutions and certain statutory boards. The total number of accounts maintained by the Bank stood at 163 as at the end of the year 1999 compared with 159 in 1998. While nine accounts of government departments and agencies were closed, thirteen new government accounts were opened during 1999.

Foreign Finance

During the year under review, the Bank continued to receive disbursements made under various foreign loans and grants, while repayments of foreign loans and interest thereon were effected on behalf of the government.

Currency Issue

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka as the sole currency issuing authority continued to perform the functions of issuing legal tender currency for the use of domestic transactions during the year 1999. The volume of currency in circulation by the end of 1999 stood at Rs.70,209.9 million as against Rs.60,087 million at the end of 1998. Notes in circulation comprised 96.3 per cent of the total currency in circulation.

The Central Bank made arrangements to issue three commemorative coins during the year 1999 to commemorate two occasions. A silver proof coin in the denomination of Rupees 1,000 and a nickel brass circulation coin in the denomination of Rupees 5 were issued to mark the winning of the 1996 Cricket World Cup by Sri Lanka and to mark the 1999 Cricket World Cup tournament held in U.K. in May/June 1999. The third coin in nickel plated steel was issued in the denomination of Rupee 1 in frosted proof and brilliant uncirculated condition to mark the golden jubilee of the Sri Lanka Army which was celebrated in October 1999.

The Currency Department of the Bank participated in an exhibition organised by the Royal Commonwealth Society, Sri Lanka Branch, on 12 September 1999. A wide collection of currencies was displayed at this exhibition. The Currency Department also participated in two school exhibitions in July and October. Currencies of Sri Lanka and foreign countries and commemorative coins issued by the Central Bank were displayed at the exhibitions. The Department conducted a seminar at Matale on 'Identification of Counterfeit Notes' for school children, the Police and the public.

The Numismatic Association of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was established mainly to create an awareness and

( V I )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

interest in the field of numismatics among the Bank staff. A series of lectures on numismatics was organised by the Association as a part of its activities. The Bank has also made arrangements to establish a modern Money Museum in the Central Bank and to publish a book titled 'History of Coins and Currency in Sri Lanka' meant for students and the general public.

The Administration Division of the Currency Department was shifted to the new Headquarters Building of the Central Bank in November 1999. The currency operations section continued to function from the Secretariat Building during 1999. The cash exchange counters also continued to function at the Moors Islamic Cultural Home (MICH) Building. The Anuradhapura and Matara Regional Offices of the Bank continued to'provide currency services to the banks and the public in the respective regions.

Banking Development

During 1999, the Central Bank issued licences under Section 5 of the Banking Act to establish two locally incorporated commercial banks (Nations Trust Bank Ltd. and National Mercantile Bank Ltd.) and a branch of a foreign bank (Bank of Nova Scotia) to carry on domestic and off-shore banking business in Sri Lanka. The Nations Trust Bank commenced operations in July 1999 and acquired the business of the Sri Lanka branch of Overseas Trust Bank which ceased its operations in Sri Lanka. In September 1999, the Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) commenced its operations. It acquired selected assets and liabilities of the Sri Lanka branch of Societe Generale. Societe Generale ceased its operations in Sri Lanka at the end of 1999. BNS is the first Canadian bank to establish

a branch in Sri Lanka. The National Mercantile Bank Ltd. is expected to commence operations in mid 2000. Meanwhile, the banking licence issued to the Korea Exchange Bank, a foreign bank, was cancelled during 1999 as the bank ceased its operations in Sri Lanka. With the commencement of business by Nations Trust Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia, and the closure of banking operations of Overseas Trust Bank, Societe Generale and Korea Exchange Bank, the number of commercial banks operating in the country was 25 by the end of 1999.

The activities undertaken by the Central Bank through its Banking Development Department for the establishment of Regional Development Banks (RDBs) in terms of the Regional Development Banks Act, No. 6 of 1997, were concluded in 1999 with the commencement of operations of the Sabaragamuwa, Wayamba and the Uva Development Banks in the first quarter of the year. These banks were licensed as specialised banks. The business of the Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) in the districts of Kalutara, Ratnapura and Kegalle was vested in the Sabaragamuwa Development Bank on 31 December 1998, while the business of the RRDBs in the Gampaha, Kurunegala and Puttalam districts was vested in the Wayamba Development Bank also on 31 December 1998. Similarly, the business of the RRDBs in Badulla, Moneragala and Ampara districts was vested in the Uva Development Bank on 17 March 1999. With the commencement of business of these three RDBs, the number of RDBs increased from 3 to 6. Thus, the number of licensed specialised banks rose to 12 by the end of 1999. With these changes, the number of commercial and specialised banks as at 31 December 1999 was 37. Table II—5 gives the number of banks for each year since 1994 together with a breakdown of the categories of banks.

The Banking Development Department of the Bank continued to process and make recommendations in relation to requests for opening, closing, relocation, etc. of branches and other offices made by commercial banks and specialised banks in terms of the provisions of the Banking Act. During the year 1999, approvals were granted for the opening of 29 branches, 57 student savings units, and one representative office abroad of commercial banks, 6 branches of specialised banks and for the closure of 5 extension offices of commercial banks. Changes of location of 45 commercial bank branches and 23 specialised bank branches were also approved during the year.

Several requests made by commercial banks for approval for investments in subsidiaries and for alterations to their Memoranda and Articles of Association were also processed by the Banking Development Department.

With the completion of the establishment of RDBs in 1999, the Banking Development Department took several initiatives to strengthen its new task of monitoring the RDBs. Further, auditors were appointed in terms of Section 47 of the Regional Development Banks Act to ascertain the net worth of each RRDB at the time its business was vested in a RDB. The RDBs were also assisted in the preparation of their

(VII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

corporate plans and annual budgets and a training programme

was organised with the assistance of the Employees' Provident

Fund Department to train the Fund Managers of the RDBs in

the area of Treasury Management.

The Banking Development Department also continued to

carry out its function of co-ordinating the activities of the three

Regional Offices of the Central Bank and monitoring their

performance.

Regional Offices

The main activities of the three Regional Offices of the Central

Bank at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale include the

provision of currency exchange facilities to the public, and

currency deposit and withdrawal facilities to commercial banks

in the respective regions (at Matara and Anuradhapura only);

collecting socio economic data; conducting beneficiary training

programmes, investor education programmes and educational

seminars for students; conducting research and carrying out

surveys; assisting in the implementation of the rural credit loan

schemes; co-ordinating the development work in the respective

regions with government departments, agencies, commercial

banks and other organisations; and the sale of Central Bank

publications.

Matara

The Matara Regional Office continued to carry out its activities relating to the implementation of the Small Holder Tea Development Project (SHTDP), Perennial Crops Development Project (PCDP), Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project, Southern Province Rural Development Project Credit Scheme and the 'Arunalu' village adoption programme. During the first half of the year, the Regional Office actively assisted in the recovery of loans granted under the SHTDP. With the assistance of the Rural Credit Department, the Regional Office carried out field investigations to recommend large loans under the Southern Province Rural Development Project Credit Scheme. Loans aggregating to Rs.21 million in respect of 87 selected applicants were recommended by the Regional Office.

Initiatives were taken by the Regional Office to arrange Forward Sales Contracts (FSCs) where producers of agricultural commodities agree to supply their produce at a determined price to the buyers beforehand. The Regional Office collected information on fruit production in the region and conducted workshops on a proposed plan by the Regional Office to establish a marketing centre for fresh fruits.

With a view to expanding the market for Government Debt Securities, a seminar was conducted for officers of financial institutions and prospective investors with the assistance of the Public Debt Department. Educational seminars were also conducted for around 2,200 students in the region. Workshops were conducted for officers of commercial banks, the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority and other participating agencies in the Galle and Matara districts.

The Regional Office also participated in the island-wide

data collection programme of the Central Bank and collection

of data for a Regional Consumer Price Index and for a district-

wise data base on Socio-Economic Statistics.

The Currency Unit of the Regional Office continued to

provide currency exchange facilities to the public as well as

deposit and withdrawal facilities to commercial banks in the

region. During the year, 206,273 cheques amounting to

Rs.4,095 million were cleared through the Regional Cheque

Clearing House at Matara.

Anuradhapura

During the year 1999, the Anuradhapura Regional Office

continued to monitor the North Central Province Participatory

Rural Development Project (NCP-PRDP) and the North Central

Province Rural Development Project (NCP-RDP). Under the

NCP-RDP, 56 persons were granted loans amounting to Rs. 1.9

million, while 25 persons were granted loans amounting to

Rs.0.7 million under the NCP-PRDP.

With the assistance of several Government departments

and institutions, the Regional Office conducted 51 training

programmes during the year. These programmes were in the

fields of self-employment, entrepreneurship development,

improvement of cultivation systems, environmental education,

savings mobilisation and marketing. Public awareness

programmes on debt securities and counterfeit currency notes

were conducted and a total of 2,443 persons participated in

these programmes. Further, 3 educational seminars were held

by the Regional Office for 890 G.C.E. Advanced Level students

in the Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala districts.

As an initial step in the introduction of Forward Sales Contracts

(FSCs), the Regional Office conducted several awareness

programmes to educate the members of companies formed by

farmers on the procedures and the benefits of FSCs, and

discussions were held with 13 such farmer companies in the

districts of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa with a view to

promoting FSCs in the region.

During the year, the Regional Office, with the assistance

of the Employees' Provident Fund Department, provided

information on Employees' Provident Fund members' balances

by issuing statements to members of the Fund. The

Anuradhapura Regional Office too participated in the island-

wide data collection programme of the Central Bank. The

Regional Office also continued to provide currency exchange

facilities to the public, and currency operation facilities to the

commercial banks in the region. The Anuradhapura Regional

Clearing House, established in the Regional Office, cleared

236,864 cheques valued at Rs.2,498 million during the year.

Matale

During 1999, the Matale Regional Office carried out several development activities in addition to conducting the traditional central banking functions assigned to it. The Regional Office continued the identification of micro enterprises for grant of

(VIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

financial assistance. 16 viable enterprises were identified, and

total financial facilities amounting to Rs.l million were

recommended. With the assistance of the Ministry of Forestry

and Environment, the Regional Office selected the village,

Dollewa, for adoption and to provide assistance in the control

of soil erosion.

Several seminars, training programmes, workshops and

exhibitions were conducted, in which 1,533 persons

participated. Important among these were the training

programme on the credit delivery system and the recovery of

loans for Managers of Regional Development Banks, the

programme to train data investigators of the 'Kandurata

Consumer Price Index', and the programme to train farmers in

dairy development and hydrophonic technology for agriculture.

In addition, with the assistance of the Public Debt Department,

a special seminar to popularise Treasury bonds was held in

Kandy for businessmen in the region. The Regional Office

continued the mobile sale of Central Bank publications and

visited 45 schools and universities.

Seedlings of pepper, banana and coconut were distributed

to selected groups of farmers. The Regional Office was also

involved with the introduction and promotion of Forward Sales

Contracts (FSCs) in the region. Under the FSCs, 95 farmers in

Morayaya in the Kandy District were selected to sign contracts

with Chemical Industries (Colombo) Ltd for the supply of seed

paddy. Further, discussions were held with the Dambulla

Farmers Company, farmers organisations and vegetable

suppliers in Dambulla to supply vegetables to the Northern and

Eastern provinces. Financial assistance to the Nalanda milk

village was also arranged through the People's Bank and the

Kandurata Development Bank during the year.

The Regional Office continued to collect and update socio­

economic data relating to the districts of Kandy, Nuwara Eliya,

Kegalle and Matale, and data on prices for the island-wide data

collection programme. The Regional Office compiled the

'Kandurata Consumer Price Index' for the year 1999 based on

the data collected from six data collection centres in Dambulla,

Matale, Kandy, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya and Hatton.

Further, the Regional Office continued to provide cheque

clearing services. The Matale Regional Clearing House cleared

121,497 cheques amounting to Rs.2,106 million, and the Kandy

Regional Clearing House cleared 796,013 cheques amounting

to Rs.23,684 million, during the year.

Regional Development Banks

During 1999, the Regional Development Banks (RDBs)

provided financial assistance for the establishment and

development of viable projects within their respective regions,

bearing in mind the need to assist the weakest segment of the

population in keeping with the objectives of the RDBs. In order

to achieve the performance targets set for each bank in its

corporate plan, several credit schemes and deposit mobilisation

schemes were introduced by the RDBs.

The Ruhuna, Rajarata, Wayamba and Sabaragamuwa

Development Banks introduced several housing loan schemes

with a view to improving the living standards of the poorest

segment of the population in the respective regions, and pledge

loan schemes for the purchase and storage of paddy. Most

RDBs have introduced self-employment loan schemes to

provide financial assistance to unemployed youth and to

women. The Yovun Prathibha (by Ruhuna DB), Ranpath,

Kapruka, Isurumaga (by Sabaragamuwa DB) and Sramabimani

(by Wayamba DB) are among those schemes. Special emphasis

was placed on the implementation of village adoption

programmes under the Arunalu Scheme, which was initiated

by the Central Bank. During 1999, each RDB had identified

several villages in the region, which were to be developed under

this scheme.

The RDBs introduced special deposit schemes targeted at

youth, school children, women and institutional employees.

Some of these schemes are the Ruhunu Vanitha and Ruhunu

Kekulu (by Ruhuna DB), savings scheme for Mahaweli settlers

and Paramitha (by Rajarata DB), Lama Diriya, Thurunudiviya

and Sanwardhana Diriya (by Sabaragamuwa DB) and Piyawara

(by Uva DB).

The performance of RDBs during the years 1998 and 1999

is given in the table below. The satisfactory financial

performance of the RDBs in 1999 is reflected in their aggregate

profit of Rs.297 million. This achievement could be mainly

attributed to the recovery of past due loans of RRDBs which

passed on to the RDBs, through an aggressive and successful

recovery drive launched by the RDBs during 1999.

The total deposits mobilised by the RDBs during 1999 was

Rs.3,412 million.

Loans and advances outstanding as at the end of 1999

amounted to Rs.4,474 million as against Rs.3,772 million as

at the end of 1998. The total loans and advances disbursed by

RDBs during the year 1999 amounted to Rs.3,613 million,

registering a significant increase of 61 per cent compared with

Rs.2,247 disbursed during the preceding year. Loans were

disbursed in 1999 to over 500,000 borrowers with the average

size of a loan being Rs.6,950. This indicates that, in keeping

with the objectives of the RDBs, a large number of small loans

had been released to needy customers in the respective regions.

Bank Supervision

The regulatory and supervisory function of the Central Bank

relating to banking institutions is undertaken by the Department

of Bank Supervision (BSD). BSD discharges its functions and

responsibilities through periodic on-site examinations and

continuous off-site surveillance of all Licensed Commercial

Banks (LCBs) and Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs). The

latter includes Regional Development Banks (RDBs). The

principal objective of supervision is to safeguard the interests

of depositors by ensuring the stability and soundness of the

banking system in Sri Lanka.

During the year under, review, two new banks that

commenced operations, Nations Trust Bank Ltd. and Bank of

Nova Scotia, came under the supervision of BSD. BSD also

supervised the winding up of the operations; in Sri Lanka of

three banks, viz., Korea Exchange Bank, Overseas Trust Bank

and Societe Generale. Nations Trust Bank Ltd. commenced

operations on 1 July.! 1999 and took over the operations of

Overseas Trust Bank whose closure took place on 30 June

1999. Bank of Nova Scotia commenced operations on 9 August

1999 and took over most of the operations of Societe Generale,

The closure of Societe Generale took place on 31 December

1999. The closure of Korea Exchange Bank took place on 24

February 1999. : .

The number: of. Licensed.Specialised Banks that came

under the regulatory authority of the Central Bank in terms of

Part IX A of the Banking Act increased to 12 with the

establishment of three Regional Development Banks viz.,

Wayamba Development Bank (WDB), Sabaragamuwa

Development Bank (SDB) and Uva Development Bank (UDB)

under the. provisions of the Regional Development Banks Act

No. 6 of 1997. Both WDB and SDB commenced operations

as Licensed Specialised Banks on 1 January 1999, while UDB

commenced operations on 18 March 1999.

On-site Examination

It is mandatory to carry out an on-site examination of each bank during each examination period, which is currently two years. The nature and scope of on-site examinations vary, but hitherto the emphasis has primarily been on carrying out an appraisal of the quality of assets of the bank and to determine the overall assessment of the financial condition of the bank. Other key aspects such as capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity, management quality, internal controls and systems and procedures are also examined. The extent of a bank's compliance with statutory requirements is also carefully examined as a part of the scope of on-site examinations. For such examinations, the Examiners visit the Head Offices and selected branches of banks, depending on the nature and scope

of the on-site examination and the emphasis placed on the

different aspects referred to above. In the case of branches that

are not visited by the Examiners, the necessary information is

obtained from the Head Offices of the banks.

Currently BSD uses a standard CAMEL (Capital, Asset

quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity) analysis as a basis

for evaluation. During 1999, action was taken to develop a risk

based supervisory approach which has been adopted by BSD

in keeping with the internationally accepted practice of banking

supervision. This was done under Phase II of an on-going

Technical Assistance Project funded by the Swedish

Government (SIDA Project) to upgrade the supervisory

capabilities of BSD. Risk based supervision focuses on risks

that.are associated with banking operations such as credit risk,

liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk.

During the year under review, BSD commenced 13 on-

site examinations in respect of 11 LCBs and 2 LSBs of which

4 were concluded in 1999. In addition, on-site examinations of

8 LCBs and one LSB which commenced in previous years were

concluded in 1999.

Off-site Surveillance System

The off-site surveillance system is a continuous supervision process conducted by BSD on the basis of the monthly, quarterly, half yearly and annual returns that are furnished by LCBs and LSBs to BSD. During the year under review, BSD continued to monitor the financial condition of all LSBs (including RDBs) and LCBs through the off-site surveillance system. The main returns that are furnished by LCBs and LSBs include, monthly statements of assets and liabilities and liquid assets, quarterly statements of capital adequacy, income and expenses, the advances portfolio, including non-performing advances, investments in equity and share ownership in the banks and the annual audited financial accounts of the banks.

With a view to improving timeliness in the submission of returns and the completeness and accuracy of the information therein, BSD has required each LCB and LSB to appoint a Compliance Officer who is responsible for submission of periodic returns and for liaising with BSD in this regard. At the same time, each LCB and LSB is assigned to an Examiner in BSD for the purpose of off-site surveillance. BSD conducted a seminar for all Compliance Officers in September 1999 to explain their role and their functions and responsibilities.

The information provided in the returns is analysed using the CAMEL components, on a quarterly basis, to ascertain the strength of capital, quality of assets, management quality, profitability and financial strength and liquidity of each LCB and LSB in relation to its own peer group and the industry. The analysis is also expected to identify significant changes or symptoms of weaknesses that could have an adverse impact on a bank, oh the basis of which prompt remedial action could be taken. Consequent to the analysis, where considered necessary, BSD communicates to the management of the relevant bank, in writing or by interview, its views and suggests the remedial action to be taken by the management.

( X )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

BSD is also engaged in the off-site monitoring of Foreign

Currency Banking Units of Licensed Commercial Banks on the

basis of: periodic returns furnished to BSD relating to assets and

liabilities, income and expenses and the maturity profile of

assets and liabilities.

Under the on-going SIDA Project, work is currently under

way to improve the off-site supervision system by linking risk

factors identified in the respective CAMEL components to the

present system of CAMEL Rating. The upgrading of the

off-site surveillance system through the Diskette Submission

System implemented under a USAID Technical Assistance

Programme has been completed with the installation of the

Electronic Reporting System in all 26 Licensed Commercial

Banks, and with the development of an in-house Report

Generating System. It is proposed to expand this reporting

system to LSBs, including the RDBs, in the future.

Regulatory Requirements

During the year under review, BSD continued to monitor compliance by banks with the regulatory requirements under the provisions of the Banking Act. These requirements include: (1) the maintenance of minimum capital adequacy ratios in relation to risk weighted assets (2) the maintenance of a minimum liquid assets ratio (3) adherence to the single borrower limit (4) limits on share ownership in a bank (5) limits on investment in equity in public quoted and private companies by a bank (6) classification of non-performing advances, suspensing of interest on such advances and adequate provisioning for bad and doubtful debts (7) restrictions on accommodation to directors, their close relations and their interests (8) submission of annual audited financial statements in a prescribed format within the stipulated statutory period and (9) acquisition and purchase of immovable property.

Disclosure Requirements

The Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision introduced by the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices recognise that sound accounting practices and transparent financial information are fundamental pillars of a sound financial system. BSD, in adhering to the core principles, has taken steps to introduce a disclosure regime which would improve market discipline. Accordingly, the following were introduced in 1999:

(a) A format for all LCBs to publish their unaudited half-yearly accounts and annual audited accounts in newspapers. Banks were required to commence publication in the newspapers with the annual audited accounts for the financial year ending on or after 31 December 1998.

(b) Following on the revised prescribed accounting format for LCBs introduced in 1998, a prescribed accounting format for the publication of annual audited accounts of LSBs

i incorporating the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards. In terms of the prescribed format, LSBs are required to ; disclose, inter alia, the following:

i

(i) an analysis of assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

(ii) significant concentrations of assets and liabilities in terms of different sectors.

(Hi) accounting policy based on which uncollectable loans, advances and finance leases are recognised as an expense or are written off, details of the movements in the provision for losses on loans, advances and finance leases during the period and the aggregate amount of provision for such losses.

(iv) information on the bank's systems and controls for managing risk and the capital available to support its risk exposures.

(v) the aggregate amount of secured liabilities, and the nature and the amount of the assets pledged as security.

(vi) trust activities.

(vii) exposure of the bank to directors, related parties and connected concerns in whatever manner related. All LSBs were required to adhere to this format in the publication of their annual audited accounts for accounting periods ending on or after 31 December 1999.

Y2K Issue

To ensure a smooth business transition in the banking and financial sector during the year 2000 roll-over, BSD , together with the Department of Information Technology (DIT) of the Bank, monitored throughout the year, the preparations for Y2K readiness of each institution coming under the purview of BSD. BSD and the DIT provided the necessary guidance by issuing Circular instructions, visiting each institution regularly to monitor the progress made, conducting workshops regularly and monitoring the contingency plans which were modelled on international requirements to ensure that all banking institutions were Y2K compliant. BSD also played a key role, together with the DIT, in the activities of the Event Management Centre (EMC) which was set up in the Central Bank during the critical period from 30 December 1999 to 3 January 2000 to liaise with the National Y2K Event Management Centre at the Computer and Information Technology Council of Sri Lanka (CINTEC) and with the financial institutions to ensure a smooth transition in each institution. The roll-over to the new millennium was successfully carried out.

Directions issued under the Banking Act in 1999

During the period under review, the following Directions were

issued by the Bank to LCBs and LSBs.

(a) Directions issued to LCBs

By this amendment, the CAR was increased from 8 per cent to 10 per cent and the Core Capital or Tier I Capital Ratio was increased from 4 per cent to 5 per cent with effect from 1 January 2001.

(c) Instructions issued to LCBs and LSBs

Having regard to the provisions of Section 77 of the Banking Act, the Central Bank issued instructions dated 1 December 1999 to both LCBs as well as LSBs cautioning them to take appropriate steps to maintain secrecy in respect of all banking transactions, particularly in the context of innovations in the field of information technology.

Deposit Insurance Scheme

The Department continued to administer the Deposit Insurance Scheme established under the Monetary Law Act, which commenced operations in 1987. Membership in the scheme is voluntary. At present, only four Multi-purpose Co-operative Societies (MPCSs) are registered under the scheme. The premium payable is 3.75 cents per quarter for every Rs.100, and the amount collected to the Deposit Insurance Fund by way of premia in 1999 was Rs.0.93 million. The Fund stood at Rs.90.4 million on 31 December 1999, which included Rs.50 million allocated to the Fund by the Central Bank. These funds have been invested in Treasury bills with a face value of Rs.101.7 million.

Supervision off Non-Bank Financial Institutions

The Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial

Institutions of the Bank continued to carry out regulatory and

supervisory functions in respect of registered finance companies

(FCs) with the objective of ensuring that FCs are adequately

capitalised, prudently managed and financially sound. The

Department strove to achieve these objectives mainly through

off-site surveillance and on-site examinations:

Brief Overview of FCs

The consolidated balance sheet of the 25 registered FCs at

31.03.98 and 31.03.99 are given in Table H-7. Total assets of

registered FCs have increased by Rs.4,531 million or 19.7 per

cent during the year. The increase in assets was reflected mainly

in the growth of advances by Rs.3,467 million or 24 per cent,

and the liquid assets by Rs.334.6 million or 12.2 per cent. There

has been no significant change in the distribution of the major

asset categories. However, the increasing trend towards lease

financing observed in the pervious year continued during this

year too. The growth in assets has been funded mainly by a

growth in deposits by Rs.2,197 million or 14.8 per cent and a

growth in borrowings by Rs. 1,593 million or 205.3 per cent

and a growth in capital funds by Rs.343 million or 10.2 per

cent.

Regulation and Supervision of Registered FCs

During 1999, the Department continued its off-site surveillance of the 25 registered FCs by analysing periodical statements furnished by these companies, to ascertain compliance with the Directions and Rules issued under provisions of the Finance Companies Act. These include minimum capital requirement, liquidity ratio, single borrower limits, adequacy of provisions for bad and doubtful debts etc. For this purpose, the Department continued to obtain from registered FCs weekly statements of liquid assets, monthly statements of large advances granted, and statements of assets and liabilities, quarterly statements of non-performing advances and the annual audited balance sheets. The profit and growth trends of registered FCs were also monitored closely to identify and arrest any adverse developments.

The Department also conducted on-site examinations of four FCs during the year. The books of accounts and other records were scrutinised and discussions were held with officers of these companies in order to make an appraisal of the adequacy of capital, quality of assets, capability of management, volume and quality of earnings and the liquidity position. The efficacy of internal systems and controls to provide timely and accurate management information was also assessed.

In addition to comprehensive on-site examinations, FCs were also subjected to spot examinations where critical areas

were covered. The area of examination depended on the

findings from the off-site examinations. Spot examinations of

the FCs were also conducted prior to the issue of annual

licences.

Failed FCs

Of the nine failed finance companies, the administration and

management of which had earlier been vested in the Monetary

Board under the provisions of the Finance Companies Act, four

companies were under liquidation as at end 1999. The Bank

continued to administer and manage the remaining five

companies. Relief payments to depositors of some of these FCs

under the 'Relief Scheme for Depositors of Registered Finance

Companies in Distress' continued during this year too.

The relief payments were made from funds obtained

through loan recoveries and sale of assets of these companies.

In the case of one failed finance company, the entire balance

capital outstanding to its depositors was repaid. The same

company also repajd the entire refinance loan of Rs.l2.68

million granted to it by the Central Bank to implement the

'Relief Payment Scheme for Depositors of Registered Finance

Companies in Distress'. Another failed finance company

commenced payment of an .enhanced relief payment of 15 per

cent of the balance capital outstanding to its fixed deposit

holders, thereby increasing capital repayment to fixed deposit

holders to 45 per cent as at the end of 1999. This Company

also repaid 15 per cent of the refinance loans granted to it by

the Central Bank, thus reducing the liability to Central Bank

from Rs.48.5 million to Rs:41.2 million.

In 1999, the Monetary Board decided to apply to the

relevant District Courts to liquidate three failed finance

companies. An application for liquidation in respect of one

failed finance company was submitted to court. Further, a

liquidator was appointed to liquidate one failed finance

company which was not vested in the Monetary Board, but to

which refinance loan facilities had been granted by the Central

Bank. An application for liquidation of another such company

was pending in the court at the end of 1999.

Policy Initiatives

During the year, the Department conducted a workshop organised by the Finance Houses Association of Sri Lanka for directors and senior management of finance companies on corporate governance. The topics discussed included the duties and responsibilities of directors, prudential requirements, disclosure standards and transparency of financial statements. Regulatory aspects discussed at the Workshop included the introduction of a minimum capital ratio based on risk weighted assets, more stringent income recognition standards, investments in shares in associate companies and provisioning for bad and doubtful debts.

Development Finance

The activities of the Development Finance Department of the Bank further expanded in 1999. The Plantation Reform Project recorded considerable progress by disbursing more refinance during the year. There was also an increase in the credit guarantee covers issued by the Department in respect of loans granted by Participating Credit Institutions under the Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project.

Consequent to the successful conclusion of negotiations with the Asian Development Bank on a new housing credit scheme aimed at low income households in Urban and Semi Urban areas, a new housing loan scheme named the Urban Development and Low Income Housing Sector Project commenced operations in March 1999.

Project inspections and follow-up work in regard to current credit schemes as well as already concluded schemes were successfully carried out during 1999.

Current Credit Schemes

Plantation Reform Project (PRP)

The total approvals of refinance under the PRP amounted to

Rs.1,512 million during 1999, whereas in 1998 it amounted to

Rs.2,564 million. The lower level of approvals in 1999 was

mainly due to the depressed demand for refinance from

Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) owing to the decline

in tea and rubber prices in the world market. However, the total

fund disbursements in 1999 recorded a considerable increase

of about 55 per cent over 1998 and amounted to Rs.1,810

million. This sum included disbursement of refinance approved

in 1998.

As in previous years, the largest portion of the loan,

totalling Rs.841 million, was approved for tree crop

development. However, disbursement of funds for tree crop

development totalled Rs.985 million, which included a part of

refinance approved during previous years. Under the processing

and improvements and pollution control component, 15 loans

amounting to Rs.425 million were approved, while Rs.575

million was disbursed which is a 45 per cent increase over

1998. Similarly, under the component purchasing of service

vehicles and equipment, Rs.249 million was disbursed in 1999,

an increase of about 72 per cent over 1998. Details of refinance

approvals and disbursements are given in Table II—8.

Among the Participating Financial Institutions in the

scheme, the National Development Bank (NDB) accounted for

46 per cent of the total disbursements to RPCs during 1999,

amounting to Rs.837 million. DFCC Bank (30 per cent), Bank

of Ceylon (BOC) (13 per cent), Commercial Bank of Ceylon

(CBC) (10 per cent) and Sampath Bank (1 per cent) accounted

for the balance disbursements. Although refinance amounting

to Rs.260 million was approved to the Seylan Bank, it did not

disburse any funds during 1999.

Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project (SMAP)

Under the SMAP Credit Guarantee Scheme which became effective in 1997, 817 credit guarantee covers amounting to Rs.653 million were issued in 1999 in respect of loans amounting to Rs.l,187 million granted by PCIs to the small and medium enterprises. During the year under review, 33 guarantees were withdrawn and 8 guarantees were fully paid. The Central Bank's liability under this scheme has increased from Rs.509 million in 1998 to Rs.653 million during 1999.

A majority of the loans disbursed under SMAP was for financing investments under the 'other' category which includes service industries such as passenger and commercial transport, vehicle servicing, restaurants, service stations, electronic related

industries and services. Loans granted to this sector increased

considerably by about 55 per cent in 1999 when compared with

1998. An industry-wise classification of loans granted under

the scheme as at end 1999 is given in Table 11-10.

Urban Development & Low Income Housing Sector Project (UDLIHSP)

After the conclusion of the Housing Guarantee Low

Income shelter Programme (HGLISP) (1992 - 1998, Phase IV)

funded by USAID under which loans were granted to low

income households, a new housing loan scheme named Urban

Development & Low Income Housing Sector Project

(UDLIHSP) commenced operations during the first half of

1999. The project is financed by a soft loan from the Asian

Development Bank amounting to US dollars 20 million (SL

Rs. 1,400 million approximately). Households in urban and

semi-urban areas, whose monthly income is less than Rs.8,500,

are eligible to obtain loans under this scheme. The Central Bank

acts as the apex lender, while the Hatton National Bank Ltd.

and Commercial Bank of Ceylon act as Participating Credit

Institutions under the scheme. Loans are given for construction

of houses, improvements to existing houses, infrastructure

development viz; obtaining of electricity and water,

construction of latrines e t c . , and land acquisition. Total

refinance approvals during the year amounted to Rs.2.9 million,

of which Rs.0.7 million has been disbursed. Out of the

approved amount of Rs.2.9 million, 55 per cent was for

improvements to existing houses.

Details of approvals and disbursements of refinance are

given in Table 11-11.

Investment of Credit Guarantee Funds

The total value of investment of credit guarantee funds in

Treasury bills amounted to Rs. 1,696 million at end 1999. The

total interest income from the investment amounted to Rs.141

million in 1999. The funds for these investments are derived

credit schemes. As the executing agency, the Bank's functions

involved admitting Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs),

issuing Operating Instructions to PCIs, disbursing refinance to

PCIs in respect of loans eligible under projects, monitoring and

co-jordinating loan schemes, maintaining loan records and

giving publicity to loan schemes with the assistance of the

relevant project offices and other agencies.

Small Holder Tea Development Project (SHTDP)

The credit component of the SHTDP was closed in December

1998. However, the Bank continued to monitor recoveries, attend to credit guarantee claims and claim reimbursements from the ADB in respect of disbursements made by PCIs in

1999. A total of 6,579 sub-loans amounting to Rs.645.9 million (approximately US dollars 11.9 million) had been refinanced by the Project upto its termination, recording a loan utilisation rate of 94.4 per cent. A Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation Survey which was conducted by two consultants engaged by the Tea Small Holding Development Authority (TSHDA) reported that the facilities provided under the Project had improved the overall performance of the sector, contributing to improve the average yield and income levels of the smallholders.

The project has maintained a satisfactory overall recovery rate of 90 per cent in 1999.

Tea Development Project (TDP)

The TDP is a follow-up of the SHTDP to continue the lending programme in the tea sector. The government entered into a loan agreement with the ADB in January 1999 to obtain assistance to the extent of SDR 26.326 million for the implementation of the TDP over a period of six years from June

1999. The broad objectives of the Project are to increase smallholders' income on a sustainable basis, and to improve the natural environment in tea growing areasl The Project consists of four major components, viz., (a) institutional reforms and strengthening; (b) tea development; (c) social infrastructure and afforestation; and (d) project management.

The credit component of the Project amounted to SDR 15.4 million and was to be used for refinancing sub-loans granted by Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to sub borrowers. The Project funded loans for the following purposes:-

(a) Re-planting of tea;

(b) Establishment of nurseries;

(c) Rehabilitation and modernisation of tea factories;

(d) Purchase of vehicles and construction of green leaf collection centres.

A salient feature of the TDP was the elongated loan maturity taking into account the long'gestation of the projects and the need for relieving borrowers of cash flow problems. Accordingly, the following loan maturities were allowed: re­planting, upto a maximum of 17 years with a grace period upto 7 years; factory rehabilitation and nursery development, upto 10 years with a grace period of 5 years. In refinancing, PFIs were also given matching loan maturity periods.

During the year under review, PFIs approved 55 loans amounting to Rs.95 million and disbursed 35 loans amounting to Rs.36 million.

First Perennial Crops Development Project Credit Scheme (FPCDPCS)

Agriculture Rehabilitation Project Credit Scheme

(ARPCS) i

The Bank continued monitoring of recoveries, conducting field inspections and meetings, corresponding with sub-borrowers, collecting credit guarantee premia and accepting credit guarantee claims in respect of the above two credit schemes during 1999. As per the terms and conditions of the credit guarantee scheme, the Bank commenced the payment of guarantee claims for eligible loans under the ARPCS. During

1999, 22 guarantee claims amounting to Rs.3.7 million were paid by the Bank.

Second Perennial Crops Development Project (SPCDP)

The SPCDP, a continuation of the First Perennial Crops Development Project (FPCDP), completed its first year of operations in 1999. This Project which covered the entire island, except the Northern and Eastern Provinces, is scheduled to be completed by 2004. The Project consists of 5 major components, viz., (a) credit; (b) farm advisory, marketing and technical services; (c) research; (d) seed and planting materials; and (<?) institutional strengthening. The Bank handles the credit component, while the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands handles the other components.

A sum of SDR 11.562 million has been allocated for the credit component to provide medium and long-term credit through PFIs for cultivation of perennial crops. Accordingly, the PFIs, viz., DFCC Bank, National Development Bank, Hatton National Bank, Commercial Bank of Ceylon and the Sampath Bank disbursed a sum of Rs. 110 million for eligible sub-projects and claimed refinance from the Bank in a sum of Rs.78 million during 1999.

The maximum individual sub-loan under the Project has been set at US dollars 150,000 or its equivalent in Sri Lanka rupees. The PFIs are allowed to approve loans upto US dollars 50,000 or its Sri Lanka rupee equivalent, while loans exceeding that amount should receive ADB approval. Sub-loans under the Project can be granted with a maximum maturity of 12 years, including a grace period of upto 6 years. In deciding the repayment period, lending banks are expected to take into account the economic life of the assets financed, the gestation period of the crops and the sub-borrower's repayment capacity as reflected in the cash flow projections.

During the year under review, the ADB approved the participation of Bank of Ceylon as a PFI of the project, thereby increasing the number of PFIs to 6. Further, the ADB has started a technical assistance (TA) project to establish a private entity for farm advisory, marketing and technical services etc. which are. now being handled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands. This move is considered as the first attempt in Sri

(XVIII)

Lanka to rely on the private sector to provide extension services

on a 'user-payment' basis.

Perennial Crops Development Project (Revolving Fund) Credit Scheme (PCDPCS)

PCDPCS (Revolving Fund) Credit Scheme was introduced in

order to provide PCIs with refinance in respect of the remaining

loan instalments of the First Perennial Crops Development

Project (FPCDP) after the Project was closed in December

1997. Funds for operating the credit scheme were drawn from

the loan recoveries of the FPCDP. The Bank entered into an

Administration Agreement in respect of the above credit

scheme with the government on 15 March 1999 and Subsidiary

Loan Agreements with PCIs subsequently. A total of Rs.39.4

million had been released to PCIs as refinance under the Project

upto end-1999. The terms and conditions of lending under this

credit scheme were more or less the same as those of the

FPCDP.

Southern Province Rural Development Project (SPRDP)

The Southern Province Rural Development Project (SPRDP) funded by the ADB commenced operations in 1992 and was to be terminated in December 1999. However, the ADB subsequently extended the period upto June 2000 to enable the Bank to claim reimbursements of the remaining funds. The main objective of the Project was to raise the income levels and the quality of life of the people in the Southern Province by creating opportunities for self-employment and income generating activities and strengthening the economic and social infrastructure in the area.

Out of the total allocation of Rs.466 million (SDR 6.4 million) for the credit component, Rs.369 million or 79 per cent was allocated to the Bank by the Ministry of Plan Implementation and Parliamentary Affairs to refinance loans granted by the PCIs for rural micro and small and medium scale industries. The balance was provided to the Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies (TCCSs) to facilitate the financing of micro-level self-employment activities.

The on-lending rate and the refinance rate under the project remained unchanged at 14 per cent and 6 per cent per annum, respectively, during 1999. The Bank had provided a sum of Rs.352 million by way of refinance to PCIs upto the end of 1999. Inclusive of refinance in the pipeline, the utilisation rate by the Bank during the entire Project period has been approximately 100 per cent of the allocation made by the Ministry. Upto the end of 1999, a sum of Rs.399 million had been disbursed by the PCIs, of which 20 per cent was contributed from their own funds. Ruhuna Development Bank (RDB) and DFCC Bank were actively engaged in this credit scheme disbursing around 7,400 loans during the project period. Out of the total loan disbursements, 85 per cent was disbursed by the RDB. In terms of the number of loans, RDB had funded 98 per cent of the loans indicating that the entirety of loans had been micro-loans.

NWP-Water Resources Development Project (NWP-WRDP)

The ADB funded North Western Province Water Resources Development Project completed its sixth year of operation in 1999. The ADB has allocated US dollars 1.8 million (approximately Rs.108 million) for the credit component of the Project. The credit component consisted of three major areas of lending, viz., (a) construction of agro-wells; (b) lift irrigation and (c) self-employment for rural women. The Regional Rural Development Banks of Kurunegala and Puttalam (whose business has now been vested in the Wayamba Development Bank (WDB)) and the Hatton National Bank participated in the credit scheme from its inception. Later in 1996, the People's Bank (PB) and the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) were also admitted as PCIs in the Scheme.

Although the credit component was scheduled to be terminated by end June 1999, the ADB, considering the satisfactory progress, subsequently extended the period by one more year upto end June 2000.

At end 1999, PCIs had disbursed Rs.31 million for the construction of 918 agro-wells and Rs.74 million for self-employment projects by 3,201 women. Under the lift irrigation component, which commenced operations in late 1996, 148 projects to a value of Rs.4 million have been financed.

The cumulative total of refinance provided to PCIs by the Bank under the scheme upto the end of 1999 amounted to Rs.100 million.

North Central Province - ADB Funded Rural Development Project and IFAD Funded Participatory Rural Development Project

The ADB funded North Central Province Rural Development Project (NCP-RDP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) funded North Central Province Participatory Rural Development Project (NCP-PRDP) commenced operations in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Both these projects aim at poverty alleviation through the improvement of productivity of farmers and the development of infrastructure facilities in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts.

The Bank functions as the apex co-ordinating agency for the credit component of both projects and operates through its Regional Office at Anuradhapura. Though PCIs were expected to finance sub-loans out of their own funds, the disbursement of credit did not take place as planned by the project management. Hence, the total loan disbursements from the inception of the projects amounted to only Rs.l.6 million. Considering this poor performance, a team of consultants engaged by the ADB to study the issues involved had reported that PCIs should be provided with refinance to fund sub-loans. Accordingly, the possibility of refinancing sub-loans by using the funds of the National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) was explored by the Bank during 1999. The negotiations with the NDTF for this purpose proved successful and refinancing sub-loans through the NDTF is expected to commence shortly.

Urban Environmental Infrastructure Development Project (UEIDP)

The Bank commenced this Project in early 1999 as the

programme administrator and the apex lender., This Project is

funded by the government through a loan of US dollars 4

million raised from the US private sector under the Housing

Guarantee Loan No.383 HG006 and guaranteed by the USAID.

The objective of the project is to promote:private sector

activities in environmental development, particularly in urban

and semi-urban areas, throughout the country.

The Project was started with the SANASA Development

Bank (SDB) and the National Development Bank (NDB) as its

PCIs to grant loans for eligible sub-projects. The SDB was

expected to fund community based environmental projects such

as safe drinking water, sanitation and waste disposal methods

through the Primary Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies

(PTCCS). NDB, on the other hand, was to finance large scale

urban waste disposal schemes implemented by local authorities.

During the year under review, the preliminary activities

in respect of project implementation were completed by the

Bank. The SDB went into action by preparing sub-project

proposals, identifying borrowers of some PTCCS and assessing

their requirements to be financed under the Project. Also, a few

awareness programmes on the project were conducted by the

Bank for the officials of some Local Authorities and community

groups.

Small Farmers and the Landless Credit Project (SFLCP) ,

The SFLCP, inaugurated in 1990 and jointly funded by IFAD (a loan of US dollars 6.7 million), CIDA (a grant of US dollars 6.6 million) and the Government of Sri Lanka (a contribution amounting to US dollar 4.1 million by the Central Bank), aims at establishing a cost effective credit delivery system for the alleviation of poverty among the poorest of the poor in the Galle, Matara, Kandy and Puttalam districts. The project relies on the credit plus approach which includes the linkage banking system, strengthened by the group lending strategy to achieve its objectives. The Central Bank functions as the executing agency of the Project on behalf of the Government. Although foreign funding for the Project was closed in December 1997 as originally scheduled after achieving the targets set for the Project at the design stage, the Project activities continued to be carried on by the Bank during 1999 by recycling the loan recoveries as provided for in the Loan Agreement signed with IFAD.

At end 1999, the Project had covered 2,397 villages in the four project districts forming 9,234 self-help groups as the vehicle for providing assistance to the project beneficiaries. The beneficiaries who were reached through these groups numbered 55,895 and were well above the target of 32,000 set in the Project design. A noteworthy feature in the Project has been the active and predominant participation ofi 38,140 women, amounting to 68 per cent of the total beneficiaries. As at the

end of the year, a sum of Rs.477 million had been advanced

as micro-loans to borrowers to enable them to undertake income

generating self-employment activities. The average size of a

loan amounted to Rs.9,579. The Project has consistently

maintained a cumulative recovery rate of over 93.7 percent. In

addition, the beneficiaries had saved Rs.63 million as group

savings up to the end of 1999 under the savings mobilisation

scheme of the Project.

In 1999, as in the previous years, the loan recoveries were

recycled to provide refinance to the RDBs, while the interest

income earned by investing excess funds was used to meet the

administration and beneficiary training expenditures of the

Project.

The Bank continued to set up Isuru Development Societies

by allowing the self-help groups (SHGs) to amalgamate

themselves into formal corporate bodies during 1999. This was

a scheme inaugurated in 1997 to facilitate the SHGs that had

come of age to strengthen their fund base, improve negotiation

capacity, enhance outreach capability and achieve greater

synergical power. Accordingly, several groups operating in a

village were formed into an SFLC Development Society and

registered with the Registrar of Companies as a limited liability

society under the Societies Ordinance. At end 1999, 177 such

limited liability societies had been formed, recording an

increase of 17 societies during the.year. Action was also taken

to form four district federations in the project districts of

Matara, Galle, Puttalam and Kandy by federating the individual

societies at the district level. The members of the federations

were elected by the society members from among themselves

(three members from each society). The federations were to be

registered under Section 21 of the Companies Act as non­

governmental organisations. The issued share capital, savings

and the loans granted from their own funds by the Development

Societies amounted to Rs.4.1 million, Rs.10.6 million and

Rs.30.7 million, respectively, as at the end of 1999. The

Development Societies will function as informal savings and

loan associations at the grassroots level which, on a future date,

may enter the formal banking business, if they achieve the

required level of maturity.

Japanese U-ko Microfinance Poverty Alleviation Project

The Government of Sri Lanka entered into a loan agreement with the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC) (formally known as OECF) on 4 August 1999 for the implementation of a micro-credit project titled the Poverty Alleviation Micro Finance Project (PAMP). The project is expected to adopt the credit plus approach which has been successfully used by the SFLCP in the districts of Kandy, Matara, Galle and Puttalam. The project aims at setting up an effective credit delivery mechanism for channelling institutional credit for income generating activities for the rural poor who have no access to credit from formal institutions. The project also expects to improve the economic conditions and the

(XX)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

general welfare of the beneficiaries and eventually contribute

to the economic and social development of Sri Lanka. On the

basis of the poor socio-economic conditions and high incidence

of poverty, 6 districts, viz., Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Matale,

Kalutara, Kurunegala and Hambantota, have been selected for

the implementation of the project in the first stage.

The total project cost has been estimated at US dollars 12.4

million (Rs.821 million) for credit, training, technical assistance

and project administration. The JBIC will provide a loan of US

dollars 9.68 million (Rs.640 million), while GOSL will be

required to finance US dollars 2.74 million. (Rs. 181 million)

to cover the project costs. The GOSL component will be funded

by the Bank on behalf of the Government.

The Bank will implement the Project through a Project

Central Office (PCO) set up in its Rural Credit Department and

a Project District Office in each of the Project districts. The

project will initially admit the RDBs operating in the six

districts in which the Project is to be implemented as its PFIs.

Other development banks will be admitted later, if such banks

are willing to participate in the Project under its terms and

conditions.

Food and Nutrition Promotion Scheme

This Project was inaugurated in 1997 at the request of the

Ministry of Agriculture and Lands. Under this Project, loans

are granted through PCIs for crop production, storage of

agricultural produce, food processing, marketing of agricultural

products and dairy and livestock development. Financial

assistance under the project is limited to co-operatives, farmers'

organisations and individuals who are members of the co­

operatives and farmers' organisations. The Project had financed

19 sub-projects to a value of Rs.19 million as at the end of

1999.

Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development (Revolving Fund) Project

This project is a continuation of the Integrated Rural Development Project of Kegalle (IRDP-K) which was completed in 1995. Hence, the new project drew its funds from the loan recoveries of the IRDP-K. The Bank continued as the refinance agency, while the IRDP District Project Office of the Ministry of Plan Implementation attended to other project activities.

In the implementation of the Project, two new mechanisms were used. First, 15 business development officers (BDOs) were engaged on a commission basis to assist PCIs to market the project, identify potential borrowers, help them prepare project proposals, link them to banks and conduct field supervision and monitoring. The engagement of BDOs helped to maintain a continuous flow of loan applications to PCIs. Second, a Project Evaluation Committee (PEC) consisting of the representatives of the Central Bank, PCIs and the District Project Office was set up to evaluate and approve loans exceeding Rs.50,000. These two measures were successful in generating a smooth implementation of project activities.

The Project had financed 2,500 sub projects amounting to

Rs.101 million by end 1999. During the year under review, the

total loans granted to the target groups under the Project

amounted to Rs.57 million. The Project has maintained an

overall recovery rate of 90 per cent, while some PCIs had

recorded a rate as high as 97 per cent.

Surathura Programme - Self Employment Promotion through Micro Enterprise Credit

The Surathura Phase I Programme was completed in 1996797.

The second phase of the project was started in 1997/98 and

continued during 1999. Under the second phase of the Project,

credit facilities were provided by PCIs out of their own funds

to the unemployed, especially to the educated youth, to enable

them to undertake income generating activities or microfinance

projects. The government paid an interest subsidy of 10

percentage points per annum to the PCIs to maintain the

on-lending rate of 10 per cent per annum. At the end of the

year under review, the Project had financed 16,433 sub-projects

to a value of Rs.614 million throughout the island. Considering

the higher demand for credit facilities for micro enterprises, the

credit target was increased from Rs.l,000 million to Rs. 1,300

million in October, 1999.

A Fact Finding Survey was conducted in respect of

borrowers whose repayments were in arrears of 12 instalments

or more. This survey was carried out in the districts of

Colombo, Kalutara and Gampaha. While the data from the

survey are presently being processed, the preliminary findings

have revealed that the loan defaulting has been mainly due to

the poor identification of the borrowers.

Matale District Regional Economic Advancement Project (REAP)

The Regional Economic Advancement Projects (REAPs) are the new generation regional development projects that have been evolved by the government on the basis of its experience with the earlier Integrated Rural Development Projects (IRDPs). REAPs differ from IRDPs in the sense that they pay a greater attention to the need for advancing the economic conditions of the people in the region by getting the private sector and the community based organisations actively engaged in the developmental process. Thus, the economic advancement brought about by the project would be self-propagating and sustainable in the long-run, even after the withdrawal of the governmental authorities from project activities. The first REAP was inaugurated by the government in the Matale District in 1999 with the Central Bank as the executing agency for the credit component.

The Loan Agreement for the REAP-Matale was signed by the government with the rFAD in early 1999. D?AD agreed to make available a loan amounting to SDR 8.35 million to the government, which consisted of a credit component amounting to SDR 2 million to be used for funding micro and medium-scale entrepreneurs in the District. The Bank implements the credit component through its Regional Office

Financial Markets

The Central Bank, through its Financial Markets Department, assists in creating a conducive policy environment for the development of financial markets in Sri Lanka, with emphasis on the debt securities market. The functions of the Department involve identifying appropriate incentives, institutional support requirements and improving operating and regulatory structures for the proper and efficient functioning of the financial markets. The Department is also responsible for coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the on-going financial sector reforms programme and for co-ordinating the activities of the Financial Sector Reforms Committee which is responsible for reforms in the financial sector. The Department also liaises with international donor agencies on technical assistance projects for the Central Bank relating to the financial sector.

During the year under review, the Department was engaged in coordinating a number of activities. Some of them are set out below.

Credit Rating Agency

As part of the strategy to promote the development of financial markets, the ICentral Bank took the initiative in making arrangements to set up a credit rating agency.

Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Lanka Limited (DCR Lanka), the first credit rating agency in Sri Lanka, was established during the year. DCR Lanka was registered as a public limited liability company under the Companies Act in August 1999, and commenced operations in October 1999. DCR Lanka is a joint venture of the Duff and Phelps Credit Rating Company of the USA, the International Finance Corporation, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and several leading local financial institutions, such as banks, provident funds, insurance companies and finance companies. The Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company USA (DCR USA), which is a leading global rating agency with a presence in more than 50 countries, is the major shareholder and is also the technical partner of the Sri Lankan credit rating company.

The initial share capital of DCR Lanka is Rs.35 million. DCR USA, the International Finance Corporation and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka hold 45 per cent, 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of the equity capital. The balance 25 per cent of the equity capital is divided equally among the other local shareholders, namely Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, National Development Bank, DFCC Bank, State Mortgage and Investment Bank, Hatton National Bank Ltd, Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd, Sampath Bank Ltd, the Employees' Provident Fund,. Employees' Trust Fund Board, Sri Lanka Insurance

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

Corporation Ltd., National Insurance Corporation Ltd., Union Assurance Ltd. and the Central Finance Company Ltd: The Board of Directors of the DCR Lanka comprises seven members, of whom three are nominees of the DCR USA. The rating operations will be undertaken by a Rating Committee consisting of representatives of the DCR USA. and the DCR Lanka staff and will not be subject to direction by the Board of Directors of the company.

The Subscription and Shareholders Agreement which sets out the rights and obligations of shareholders of the company was executed in October 1999. The Know-How and Technical Assistance Agreement and the Trademark and Corporate Name Licence Agreement were signed between DCR Lanka and DCR USA during the year.

The credit rating company is expected to play an important role in the overall development of the capital market in Sri Lanka. (See Box Article 10)

Scripless Government Securities System and the an Electronic Funds Transfer System

The Central Bank proposes to introduce a scripless trading system for Treasury bills and Treasury bonds and an electronic funds transfer (payments) system in the year 2000. The preparatory work on the procedures, systems design and the development of computer software has been completed, and the testing of the system commenced during the year.

Tax Incentives for the development of the Debt Market

Several tax incentives have been provided over the past few years to develop the government and private debt market. The reforms were also aimed at removing the tax bias that discriminated against debt securities vis a vis equities, thereby establishing a level playing field for debt and equity securities. The following measures were implemented in 1999.

(a) The removal of stamp duty on debt instruments, such as debentures, bonds and commercial paper listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.

(b) The removal of stamp duty on repurchase agreements relating to Treasury bills.

(c) The removal of withholding tax on interest paid on debt securities listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.

(rf) The removal of capital gains on share warrants and derivative instruments.

The Central Bank has also recommended that the stamp duties on mortgages and other taxes affecting asset securitisation should also be reduced.

Legislative Enactments and Proposed Legislation

The National Savings Bank (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 1999 became law in 1999. The amendments introduced by this Act

(XXIII)

Part II

specify, the range of activities the NSB'could engage in as a specialised savings bank, and also remove the impediments to the creation.of a capital base for the bank by capitalizing its dormant accounts.

.Several.draft bills and regulations were prepared during the year.. The bills are expected to be finalised and presented to Parliament in 2000. The following are the draft bills and regulations. |

(a) Draft Bill to amend the Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949

The objectives of the Central Bank, as stated in the Monetary Law. Act; are to be amended to emphasise the maintenance of price stability as its principal object, in order to avoid any policy conflicts that may arise due to " the pursuit of multiple objectives: The other proposed amendments relate to increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy by broadening the!definition of 'money supply' and eliminating certain anomalies with regard to the requirement to maintain statutory reserves.

(b) Draft Bill to amend the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988

The proposed amendments would strengthen. the supervisory and regulatory powers; of the Central Bank relating to licensing procedures, revocation of licenses, amalgamation, liquidation and; closure of banks, qualifications, appointment and removal of bank directors and senior management.

Accounting and Auditing Standards

The accounting and auditing standards-adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka were gazetted in 1999. The 'specified business enterprises' as defined in the Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Act, No. 15 of 1995 have been required to prepare their accounts and have them audited in terms of the accounting and auditing standards. The Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board, established by that statute, will monitor and enforce compliance with the standards.

The Agreements between the Government of Sri Lanka and the State Owned Commercial Banks

The Central Bank continued to monitor the performance of the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank tinder the Agreements signed with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) on 16 July 1998.

The objectives of the Agreements are to improve the banks' profitability, efficiency and financial soundness by commercialising and consolidating operations,.increasing productivity, reducing costs, rationalising staff levels and the branch network, conserving assets, increasing loan recoveries arid improving risk managehteht.

The Agreements seek to improve the banks' internal governance and financial performance by providing the management with operating autonomy arid by specifyirig annual quantitative performance targets. These include profitability targets, such as return on'assets and return on capital, efficiency targets such as staff costs and overhead costs to average assets, and financial soundness targets for loan recovery and non-performing loans. The Agreements are also aimed at reducing administrative and intermediation costs through

(XXIV)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

branch rationalisation and restrictions on staffing levels. The banks are required to submit quarterly performance reports to the GOSL and the Central Bank on the achievement of targets and on other requirements.

The Bank of Ceylon introduced a new branch accounting system during the year to assess the profitability and viability of its branch network. The new system is based on a uniform transfer pricing and cost allocation methodology which was recommended for the two banks by a working group consisting of officers from the Central Bank, Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank and a firm of chartered accountants. The People's Bank is expected to implement the new branch accounting system in 2000.

Special audits of the current loan and investment portfolios of Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank were conducted in 1999 to determine the overall quality of the banks' loan and investment portfolios and the necessary levels of loss provisioning based on international standards. The audits were conducted by international auditors.

Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank have engaged the services of consultants to assist in the preparation of strategic and structural reorganisation plans.

Technical Assistance Projects

The Financial Markets Department co-ordinated the implementation of the following technical assistance projects with various donor agencies during the year.

(a) Developing the Portfolio Management Expertise of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF)

A team of consultants assisted the EPF in improving its portfolio management capacity. The technical assistance included the preparation of investment guidelines for the EPF and the training of staff in fund management techniques.

(b) Automation of the Central Bank Payments System and the Government Debt Securities Market

A study on automating the Central Bank's payment systems and a scripless system for Treasury bills and bonds was undertaken by consultants during 1999. The consultants also prepared the technical specifications of the computer hardware and software required for a 'real time gross settlement system'.

(c) Surveillance of Primary Dealers

The Central Bank has prepared a new legal framework for the supervision of Primary Dealers. Consultants were identified to assist the Central Bank in setting up the surveillance mechanisms and to provide staff training. The consultancy is expected to begin in January 2000.

(d) Computerisation of the Off-site Surveillance of Banks

The Department of Bank Supervision developed a software package for the off-site surveillance of banks. The project

involves the preparation of formats for obtaining financial

data from banks on diskettes. The system would also have

an early warning mechanism. The system became

operational in 1999.

(e) Upgrading the supervisory capabilities of the Bank Supervision Department

The project involves upgrading the on-site and off-site

supervisory capacity of the Bank Supervision Department.

The project will focus on introducing a risk based approach

to bank supervision and expanding the automation of the

off-site surveillance system, including staff training.

(0 Private Sector Development Programme

A technical assistance grant was provided to assist in

formulating a programme of policy reforms to support

private sector development in Sri Lanka. The project

focused on the following areas - privatisation and

commercialisation of public enterprises, private investment

in infrastructure, competition, corporate governance and

consumer protection, labour market reform, capital market

development and insurance regulation. The consultants

have prepared a policy matrix covering a set of reform

proposals that will comprise a programme to support

private sector development. The consultants completed the

technical assistance in 1999 and a project is scheduled for

2000.

(g) Pension Reform Project

Technical assistance has been obtained to engage

consultants to assist in introducing pension reforms. The

technical assistance will be used to set up a regulatory

authority for insurance and private superannuation funds,

and to make proposals for reforming the pension and

provident fund system and for modernising the insurance

industry. The consultants will begin the assignment in early

2000.

Research Activities

The Economic Research Department (ERD) assisted the Governor and the Monetary Board in the conduct of monetary policy and in the performance of the Central Bank's role as economic adviser to the government. The Department collected and analysed statistical and other information on the Sri Lanka economy as well as on the trends and recent developments in the world economy and undertook further economic research work. It improved and enhanced the supply of economic information to the public, that being one of the major responsibilities of the Central Bank. The Department directly co-ordinated Sri Lanka's relationships with the IMF and the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty Four (G-24) on International Monetary Affairs, while also helping the Ministry of Finance in the co-ordination of its work with other international organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian

( X X V )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

Development Bank and other multilateral and bilateral donors.

The Department was also involved in providing technical

support in the coordination and maintenance of some of the

international relations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and

the Ministry of Trade. In addition, the ERD provided policy

advice/observations on various matters referred to the

Department by other departments of the Bank as well as the

Ministry of Finance. The services of research officers in the

Department were made available for training of post-graduate

degree aspirants of the Bank and for dissemination of

knowledge through guidance of research work, public lectures,

seminars and work shops.

The ERD compiled the weekly and monthly economic

indicators and made these available, to the public expeditiously

through the Internet and newspapers. The lag in the publication

of the Monthly Bulletin was shortened. A new interest rate

index called the Sri Lanka Inter-bank Offered Rate, 'SLIBOR'

was introduced to give an indication on the likely rates for rupee

transactions among commercial banks for different maturities,

(see Box Article 9). The objective is to help the domestic

money market to use this as a base to determine yield rates for

innovative money market instruments.

The Department contributed to and co-ordinated the

publication of the 1998 Annual Report of the Central Bank in

collaboration with other departments of the Bank. In addition,

the September 15th Report, a report prepared under Section 116

of the Monetary Law Act, to be used in the preparation of the

government budget, was completed and submitted to the Hon.

Minister of Finance. Similarly, the Department published the

report 'State of the Economy 1999' to be'used in the preparation

of the Budget. Subsequently, this was updated with an analysis

of the prospects of the economy, giving scenarios of the

possible trends 'with' and 'without' war. The latter was

published with the presentation of the Budget 2000.

The publication of a monthly industrial production index,

based on a sample survey of 100 major industrial firms,

continued. The detailed half-yearly and annual private sector

industrial production surveys were also continued. The

Department conducted a survey on the 'Payment of Goods and

Services Tax (GST) by Eating-Houses in the Colombo

Municipal Area'. 1

The ERD coordinated two major international seminars,

the 'G-24 Technical Group Meeting'! and the seminar on

'Ageing Population and Social Security Systems', in 1999.

Senior research officers of ERD participated as resource

persons in several internal seminars and some public seminars

arranged by the Centre for Banking Studies. The officers of

ERD undertook a number of research studies, some of which

were on their own initiative. These included policy oriented

research as well as studies which are largely of academic

interest, covering macro and micro economic issues, including

a study on the likely impact of the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade

Agreement. Some of these were published in the last two issues

of the 'Staff Studies' of the Central Bank.

The Department provided inputs for the on-going research and training programme of the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training Centre while a few officers were directly involved in collaborative research projects undertaken by the SEACEN Centre. As the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is to host the 23rd SEANZA Central Banking Training Course and the SEANZA Governors' Symposium in year 2000, the Department was involved in the development of the Training Course and the co-ordination work for the two events. The SAARC cell, established in the Department, co­ordinated the activities of the Network of SAARC Central Bank Governors and Finance Secretaries.

A number of Board Papers were submitted to the Monetary Board advising on the monetary implications of various foreign loan agreements to be entered into between the Government of Sri Lanka and donors, and the decisions of the Monetary Board were conveyed to the Ministry of Finance. The Department also helped in the preparation of guidelines for a contributory pension scheme for new CentraJ Bank employees.

Some of the senior officers of ERD served on several important committees, both within the Bank and outside. These included the Inter-Ministerial Sub Committee on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GTS) and the Sub Committee on Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties, the Balance of Payments Committee, the Exchange Rate Committee, the Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds Tender Committees and the Monetary Operations Unit which was replaced in late 1999 by three committees namely, the Liquidity Assessment Committee, the Open Market Operations Committee and the Domestic Debt Management Committee. The Department represented the Central Bank in some of the preparatory meetings on bilateral trade relations such as the Sri Lanka-China joint Commission, the Commission on Pakistan Sri Lanka Trade Relations, the Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand Economic Cooperation (BIMST-EC) Round Table Conference held in Bangkok and the BIMST-EC Tourism Conference held in Colombo.

The financial programming framework used in the conduct of monetary policy was further improved by incorporating the broad monetary survey (i.e. monetary survey with FCBUs included) in the projection of monetary aggregates.

Statistics and Field Surveys

The Statistics Department continued to carry out its functions of compilation, analysis and dissemination of (a) macro level socio economic data, including national accounts, prices and wages and (b) micro level data on the household and corporate sectors. In addition, the Department undertook a special project to formulate a scheme to promote a forward market for agricultural commodities.

The collection of wholesale and retail price data of food commodities in key market centres was continued. The frequency of collection of retail price information from some markets was increased from a weekly basis to a daily basis. At the same time the dissemination of price and wage data was

(XXVI)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

expanded. Daily price information was disseminated to the print

and electronic media and also to relevant institutions.

The major tasks accomplished by the Department during

the year, included publication of the report on the Consumer

Finances and Socio Economic Survey 1996/97, and the

launching of the Forward Market Scheme for agricultural

commodities. Several awareness programmes were conducted

on the Forward Market Scheme to implement identified pilot

projects. The first project commenced in December 1999,

where a group of farmers at Morayaya in Mahiyanganaya

entered into forward sales contracts to sell paddy from the crop

to be harvested in Maha 1999/2000 to CIC Seeds Pvt. Ltd, at

a contracted price negotiated in advance.

Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey -1996/97

The report on the Consumer Finances and Socio Economic

Survey conducted in 1996/97 by the Statistics Department was

published in 1999. The survey is regarded as a landmark survey

for several reasons. Firstly, the survey coincided with the

fiftieth anniversary of independence of Sri Lanka. Secondly, it

also coincided with the completion of twenty years of economic

liberalisation. Thirdly, the survey was conducted at a time when

Sri Lanka was reaching the middle income country group and

thus, the survey reveals the socio economic conditions of the

country during the transition period. Fourthly, the survey

findings will be useful to visualise the socio economic prospects

of the country in the 21st century.

The findings of the survey are discussed under seven

chapters, namely; (1) Objectives and Methodology

(2) Demographic Features (3) Socio Economic Conditions

(4) Labour Force, Employment and Unemployment (5) Income

(6) Expenditure and Consumption and (7) Savings, Investments

and Loans. During the year under review, the Department

acceded to requests made by both public and private sector

institutions by providing specially tabulated data.

While strengthening its data base pertaining to a series of

socio economic variables, the national accounts database was

also updated by using the statistical results derived from the

consumer finances and socio economic survey as benchmark

estimates; The survey data were also used to construct new

consumer price indices for several districts, i.e. Colombo,

Anuradhapura, Matara and Matale.

A Scheme for Forward Markets in Agriculture Produce

The Department has formulated a scheme to promote trading in agricultural commodities under forward sales contracts. The objective of this scheme is to ensure a stable price to the fanner and to assure a stable supply to traders, agro-processing industries and exporters according to quality specifications required by the trade. Under this scheme, the conventional 'systems of informal forward sales could be

transformed to formal contracts by introducing a Forward Sales

Contract document. Accordingly, the contracted price, the

quantity, the quality, period of delivery, along with the terms

and conditions negotiated and agreed upon between the two

parties are recorded, with banks assuming the role of

facilitators.

The banks as facilitators are expected to bring the buyers

and the sellers together. As both buyers and sellers could assign

the contract document to a bank as collateral, the scheme

provides greater access to credit facilities from the banking

sector for agriculture production, agro processing and

marketing. The Regional Development Banks and Bank of

Ceylon have already formulated credit schemes to grant loans

under this system. Other banks have expressed strong interest

to formulate similar schemes in due course.

Country Wide Data Collection System

The Country Wide Data Collection System which was

commenced by the Statistics Department in 1978 completed 21

years of operation in 1999. Under this programme, information

on retail prices of consumer goods, producer prices of

agricultural commodities and wage rates pertaining to the

informal sector continued to be collected regularly. The scheme

is also used to monitor the performance of agriculture in major

producing areas. Data collection is accomplished through an

island-wide network of school teachers who function as

statistical investigators. The sub sectors of paddy, tea, rubber,

coconut cultivation and small-scale construction are covered by

the scheme. Information collected is published regularly

through the print and electronic media. In order to improve the

quality of data collected through the investigators, and with the

intention of using these data for the computation of regional

consumer price indices, seminars were conducted in Colombo,

Anuradhapura, Kandy and Matara in 1999 to provide training

for the data collectors.

The Department continues with its scheme of collecting

wholesale and retail prices of major food items from the Pettah

market and from other centres like Maradagahamula rice

market and the Dambulla market on a daily basis. Information

so collected is published daily in the newspapers and through

electronic media with a view to disseminating the information

to farmers, traders and consumers. The data are also provided

for carrying out forward market transactions and for use by

government and private sector agencies.

Computation of District-wise Consumer Price Indices

The Department continued to compute the Colombo District Consumer Price Index (CDCPI) which was introduced in 1998 as a supplement to the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI) computed by the Department of Census and Statistics. The target population for this index is the lowest 40 per cent of the district population ranked by income. It has a

(XXVII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

broader coverage than the CCPI. The information for the

computation of the index is obtained from 11 centres in the

Colombo District, namely Hanwella, Homagama, Moratuwa,

Avissawella and the Pettah market which are established under

the Country Wide Data Collection System and newly

introduced centres of Kolonnawa, Nugegoda, Dehiwala,

Piliyandala, Maharagama and Padukka from January 1999. The

information from these centres is collected by officers of the

Statistics Department and appointed teacher investigators.

The Department also computed three regional consumer

price indices for the districts of Anuradhapura, Matara and

Matale. The commodity weights for the indices are based on

the expenditure patterns of respective districts derived from the

Consumer Finances and Socio-economic Survey 1996/97

conducted by the Central Bank. The target population used to

construct the weights of the indices consisted of the lowest 40

per cent of households in the district ranked by income. These

indices are useful to analyse regional price variations.

Information on regional price movements is useful for forward

trading in agricultural commodities.

Further, the Statistics Department has engaged in the

computation of a new index for the Western Province on an

experimental basis, with a wider coverage than the CDCPI. This

index covers the lowest 80 per cent of the households ranked

by the level of income. Weights are based on the expenditure

pattern revealed by the Consumer Finances and Socio

Economic Survey 1996/97 conducted by the Central Bank of

Sri Lanka. Data collection centres have been extended beyond

major trading centres of the CDCPI to selected super markets

in the city so as to capture changing consumption patterns.

National Accounts

The Department continued the activities in connection with the estimation of national accounts. These included the collection and compilation of primary and secondary data for the estimation of National Accounts on a quarterly and annual basis. The Department commenced publishing national accounts on a quarterly basis (in constant terms) in 1998. The estimation procedure of the quarterly series was further strengthened in 1999. In addition to the constant series of quarterly accounts which have been published since June 1998, the Department compiled the series at current factor cost prices which are published for the first time in this Annual Report.

In 1999, the Department endeavoured to strengthen the estimation procedures of national accounts, in general, giving wider coverage to informal and emerging economic activities. These activities included retail trade, light engineering, restaurants and catering services, automobile maintenance, air conditioning, computer assembly and the software industry, personal services, entertainment services, advertising etc.

Meanwhile, the Department continued to disseminate the quarterly national accounts data to the general public and the users through the media in 1999. These data are now accessible through the Central Bank web-site.

Publications

The Department released two volumes of its annual publications, titled 'Sri Lanka Socio-Economic Data 1999 -Volume XXIT and 'Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 1999 - Volume XXI' which provide comprehensive time series and cross-sectional data on socio-economic variables, including demography, labour force and employment, national income and expenditure, agriculture, industry, external trade and finance, prices and wages, money, banking, capital market, government finance and socio-economic services. The data in these publications also include comparative statistics for regional economic groups. The coverage and presentation of both publications were improved in the volumes in 1999. In addition, the Department contributed to several other publications of the Central Bank.

Employees' Provident Fund

The Monetary Board continued to perform its functions as the custodian of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) during 1999 in close co-operation with the EPF Division of the Department of Labour. In terms of the EPF Act, the functions of the Monetary Board in relation to EPF consist of receiving contributions, surcharges and income from investments, maintaining proper accounts of registered employments and members of the Fund, investing excess funds in suitable investments and paying benefits to the Fund's members.

The modernisation programme of the EPF that commenced in 1996 was continued by the Bank during 1999. According to this programme, internal operations of the Fund were fully computerised with software developed in-house by the Bank's software developers. It facilitated the Fund to update its accounts, automate the refund process and service the members and employers promptly. In addition, the diversification of the investment portfolio of the Fund was also continued during 1999, taking into account recent developments in the country's money and capital markets. The aim of the diversification programme was to raise the Fund's incomes to enable it to pay the highest possible rate of return to members, while ensuring the safety of the investments.

The following are the salient features of the new developments in the EPF under the modernisation program :-

Automation of the Refund Recommendation Process

Ever since the Fund was set up, the refund recommendations (Letters of Determination) from the Commissioner-General of Labour have been received by the Bank in documentary form. This process was fully computerised in 1999, facilitating the Commissioner-General of Labour to send refund recommendations via electronic media directly to the computer system of the Fund in the Central Bank. This not only facilitated the processing of refunds, but also resulted in a significant reduction in the time taken to effect a refund.

(XXVIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

External Terminal Facilities at the Labour Department

A service terminal of the main computer system of the Fund

was provided to the Department of Labour enabling the

Commissioner-General of Labour to have access to the main

database in the computer system to verify names, member

numbers and contributions. This facility helped the

Commissioner-General of Labour to advise members who

applied for refunds of any discrepancy in names or numbers

or contributions, so that applications for refunds could be

corrected at the inception, thereby avoiding subsequent delays

and inconvenience. Thus, a large number of refund

recommendations that were earlier returned to the

Commissioner-General of Labour on account of discrepancies

could now be expeditiously dealt with in this manner. In

addition, several outstation offices of the Department of Labour,

viz., Kandy, Kegalle, Hatton, Ratnapura, Gampaha, Galle and

Matara have also been provided with terminal facilities linking

the outstation offices to the main computer system of the Fund.

The Central Bank Regional Office at Anuradhapura has also

been provided with this facility. This has permitted the

members to verify their balances without having to call at the

Central Bank in Colombo, and also enabled Labour Department

officials to check on defaulting employers on line.

Commencement of Issuing Half Yearly Member Statements

For the first time in the history of the Fund, arrangements were

made to issue statements to members half yearly with a detailed

breakdown of monthly contributions paid to their accounts. The

statements pertaining to the first half of 1999 were issued in

November 1999, and action is being taken to issue the

statements for the second half before the end of April 2000.

The new format of the statement which provides more up-to-

date information to members is expected to serve as a self

policing system to detect omission in paying contributions,

since the monthly breakdown of the contributions reported in

the statement will indicate any default in payment by

employers.

The Collection of Contributions through Electronic Media

Employers have been paying their EPF contributions since the

establishment of the Fund in 1958 by filing with EPF a schedule

containing the details of the members (i.e., name, number,

contribution'etc.) with their payments. To input these data into

the computer system, the EPF in turn, had to undertake

laborious data entry work increasing costs and causing delays

in issuing member statements. Hence, after studying the

feasibility and developing the necessary software, EPF

commenced in 1999, the collection of contributions from large

employers with a computerised pay-roll through diskettes, in

the first instance, and via e-mail, once the system became

established. In the programme, an option was also given to employers to make payments through the Sri Lanka Interbank Payments System, thereby obviating the necessity for making payments by cheque. At end 1999, 70 employers, mainly BOI sponsored garment factories, had joined the new scheme. In the years to come, the programme will be expanded to cover all employers with computerised pay-rolls.

Streamlining Investments

In order to streamline the investment process of the Fund, 12 fund management trainees were recruited to the Fund to be trained as fund managers with financial assistance from the World Bank. The objective of the training programme was to develop the in-house fund management capacity of the EPF, so that it could progressively diversify its portfolio into non­government sectors, and also acquire the capacity to monitor the performance of external fund managers, if the EPF chooses to engage the services of external fund managers to manage a part of its portfolio in the future.

Investments in the Equity Market

The EPF also commenced investing in the equity market in 1998 as a part of its strategy to diversify its investment portfolio. These investments were continued during the year under review on a very modest scale, selecting only good stocks for investment. Table H-15 below presents the position of the equity investments as at the end of 1999, together with the return from them. Though the operation was very modest, the equity portfolio yielded a rate of return of 28 per cent during the year.

Secondary Market Trading

The EPF was also actively engaged in the secondary market in Treasury bonds and Treasury bills. The secondary market operations enabled the EPF to enhance the, otherwise fixed, rate of return on Treasury bonds and Treasury bills. Table II-16 below gives the details of the secondary market operations of the EPF during the year under review.

i Exchange Control

In 1999, the Exchange Control Department (ECD) took several policy measures for further liberalisation of exchange control, while intensifying the monitoring of foreign exchange transactions with a view to avoiding any exchange malpractices and abuses. The grant of general permission to all banks licensed under the Banking Act to extend rupee credit facilities to non-resident controlled companies other than companies approved under Section 17 of the Board of Investment Act (BOI Act), the withdrawal of the requirement of a minimum balance of US dollars 500 or its equivalent in any other foreign currency to maintain a Resident Foreign Currency Account, and the grant of permission to earn interest and repatriate such interest on blocked funds held by Sri Lankan emigrants and non-nationals were some measures taken for further

liberalisation of exchange control. The requirement to indicate

the income tax file number in applications for purchase of

foreign exchange in excess of US dollars 5,000 or its equivalent

in other designated foreign currencies for travel abroad, and the

introduction of a reporting system to monitor foreign exchange

payments in respect of expenditure incurred abroad by Sri

Lankan residents on Electronic Fund Transfer Cards (EFTCs),

were some measures taken to intensify the monitoring scheme.

As in the previous year, the ECD continued its activities

in the areas of certain capital transactions, foreign investments,

blocked funds held by Sri Lankan emigrants and non-nationals,

private foreign borrowings, monitoring of current international

transactions, registering freight forwarders, granting and

renewing of permits of Money Changers and of hoteliers,

jewellery shops and others who are permitted to accept payment

in foreign currency for goods and services provided to

foreigners.

(1) Capital Transactions

a. Rupee Lending to Non-resident Controlled Companies

In a bid to further liberalise access to rupee credit facilities to

non-resident controlled companies, the Central Bank (with

effect from 14 February 1999), granted general permission in

terms of the provisions of the Exchange Control Act to all banks

licensed under the Banking Act, to grant accommodation,

including loans and advances, to Sri Lankan companies with a

majority of non-resident shareholdings, other than such

companies approved under Section 17 of the BOI Act. Requests

of non-resident controlled companies approved under Section

17 of the BOI Act for rupee credit facilities were considered

by the ECD on a case-by-case basis.

b. Borrowings from Abroad by Resident Companies

The ECD continued to consider applications by companies, other than companies approved under the Section 17 of the BOI Act and exempted from the provisions of the Exchange Control Act, to obtain foreign currency loans from abroad. During the year, three applications to borrow in foreign currency from sources abroad were approved.

c. Non-resident Investments in Sri Lanka

The ECD continued to grant permission, where appropriate, for

capital transfers such as sale proceeds of shares in respect of

investments made by non-residents in Sri Lanka, where such

transfers did not fall within the terms of the general permission

granted by the notice published in the Government Gazette No.

721/4 of 29 June, 1992.

d. Investments Abroad by Sri Lankan Residents

Capital transfers for investments in projects abroad by Sri

Lankan residents were continued to be permitted by the ECD,

on a case by case basis, with the approval of the Hon. Minister

of Finance and Planning. During 1999, twelve applications for

( X X X )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

investments in projects in several foreign countries were permitted. The total value of these investments was US dollars 24.4 million.

e. Blocked Funds Held by Sri Lankan Emigrants and Foreign Nationals

Funds realised from the sale of capital assets belonging to Sri

Lankan emigrants and non-nationals were continued to be kept

in blocked accounts and the release of such funds were

permitted through commercial banks up to Rs.750,000 per

person, subject to a ceiling of Rs.l million per family. During

the year 1999 ECD permitted capital transfers in a sum of Rs.48

million from blocked funds on the basis of 86 applications for

such transfers. In 1999, the commercial banks were permitted

to pay interest in respect of blocked funds in accounts

maintained with them, and to remit the accrued interest to the

account holders.

(2) Registration of Freight Forwarders and Issue of Permits for Foreign Exchange Transaction

ECD continued to register freight forwarders, issue/renew

permits to Money Changers, issue/renew permits to

establishments such as hotels, duty free shops, travel agents,

to accept payment in foreign currency for goods sold or services

provided by them to tourists. The activities of freight forwarders

and the foreign exchange transactions carried out by

establishments to which permits were issued were monitored

by ECD as in the previous years.

a. Authority for Travel Agents to issue Travellers' Cheques

During the year no new permits were issued to travel agents

to issue travellers cheques to residents of Sri Lanka who travel

abroad. Hence, the number of travel agencies permitted to issue

travellers cheques remained at 6.

b. Appointment of Money Changers

The criteria for appointing Money Changers were revised

during the year under review. Accordingly, only the companies

incorporated in Sri Lanka with at least an issued and paid-up

capital of Rs. 1 million with a good track record qualified to be

considered for appointment as Money Changers. At the end of

1999, there were 30 approved Money Changers.

(3) Monitoring

With the liberalisation of exchange control, Authorised Dealers

(ADD) and approved Travel Agents were permitted to release

foreign exchange without restriction for current transactions,

exercising their judgement and discretion and after satisfying

themselves with the bona-fides of the requests.

All ADD and approved travel agents are required to report

to ECD foreign exchange releases, on a regular basis, to enable

ECD to monitor the transactions. In the absence of a specific

procedure laid-down with regard to Electronic Fund Transfer

Cards (EFTCs), the ADD had not reported to ECD, the releases

of foreign exchange in respect of payments made abroad by

residents of Sri Lanka through EFTCs. Therefore, in order to

monitor such transactions, the ECD introduced a reporting

system, similar to the reporting procedure which was in

operation in respect of releases of foreign exchange in the form

of foreign currency, travellers' cheques etc. for travel abroad.

Accordingly, ADD were required with effect from 17

December 1999 to report to ECD all issues of EFTCs to Sri

Lankan residents for use abroad. ADD were also required to

furnish a monthly report on expenditure in foreign exchange

incurred abroad by each cardholder in excess of US dollars

5,000 or its equivalent in any other foreign currency per month.

ECD continued to monitor payments made in advance for

imports in order to ensure the receipt of goods and services in

the country against such advance payments. Credits and debits

made in rupee current accounts maintained by shipping and

airline agents as well as freight forwarders on behalf of foreign

principals continued to be monitored. Capital transfers made

through Share Investment External Rupee Accounts (SIERA)

were also monitored by ECD.

(4) Investigations

The ECD conducted several investigations into violations of

provisions of the Exchange Control Act by some resident and

non-resident companies as well as individuals. Penalties were

imposed where offences had been committed, and the total

amount of such penalties imposed during the year amounted

to Rs.28 million. Several major investigations which were

carried out in 1999 have not been concluded as yet.

Public Debt

In terms of Section 113 of the Monetary Law Act, the Central

Bank is entrusted with the issuance, management and servicing

of domestic debt and the servicing of foreign debt of the

Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL). These activities are handled

by the Public Debt Department (PDD) of the Central Bank. In

discharging its responsibilities, the PDD continued to issue

domestic debt instruments, namely Rupee loans, Treasury bills

and Treasury bonds in 1999. In addition to the issuance and

servicing of public debt, the PDD handles the activities relating

to issuance and servicing of Central Bank securities (CBSs), a

monetary policy instrument. However, there were no CBSs

issued in 1999. The PDD also handled the service payments

of Tax Reserve Certificates (TRCs) and debenture issues on

behalf of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB), the

National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) and the

Urban Development Authority (UDA).

Development Activities

During 1999, the PDD took several steps to further develop the

domestic debt securities market. Regular meetings were held

( X X X I )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

with Primary Dealers (PDs) with a view to maintaining a

continuous rapport between the Central Bank and PDs on

current developments in the debt securities market.

The electronic bidding system, which was introduced on

a trial basis in June, 1998, commenced operations in May 1999.

The releasing of results of primary Treasury bill auctions was

also done through this system.

Arrangements were made to introduce a semi-scripless

system with a view to activating the secondary market for

government debt securities. Software for this system was

developed by the Department of Information Technology of the

Bank. The system would facilitate transactions such as outright

sales and purchases, repos and reverse repos and lending and

borrowing of securities. The Central Depository System (CDS)

which will be installed at the PDD will operate on-line with

the settlement system of the Banking Department. Test runs of

the system using dummy portfolios commenced in November

1999 to test the software. Operating instructions on the

semi-scripless Depository and Trade Recording System were

prepared and circulated by the PDD among PDs during the

year. Further, the PDD jointly with PDs took initial steps to

introduce an Electronic Front-end Trading (Screen Broker)

System for PDs.

During the year under review, the PDD engaged in

developing the modalities to improve the primary issue and

trading of debt instruments in the secondary market. One such

activity relates to issue of Treasury bills, effective from October

1999, on a day count basis in conformity with international

practice. Accordingly, an actual/364 days basis for Treasury

bills was adopted both in the primary and the secondary

markets. The issue of Treasury bills on this basis commenced

with maturities of 91 days, 182 days and 364 days in place of

3 month, 6 month and 12 month maturities hitherto issued. In

order to adopt this uniform practice in the market, PDs were

expected to comply with the new day count basis (actual/364

days) in their secondary market transactions relating to Treasury

bills as well. Treasury bills which had been issued in the past,

will remain in the market with 3, 6 and 12 months maturities

until maturity. The procedures for calculating yield rates etc.

in the primary market were amended accordingly.

The database on the activities of the government debt

market continued to be updated and maintained. Data were

analysed and published by the PDD for the information of the

public. In order to improve public awareness of government

debt securities, information was released regularly to the market

in the form of press releases through both print and electronic

media. The data were also used to compute indicators on

performance of PDs as well as market activities. This

information, among other things, enabled the PDs to ascertain

their positions in relation to total market activities. The database

has also been used to prepare the Annual Review of

Performance of PDs since 1995.

As a part of the public and investor awareness programme,

the PDD jointly with the three Regional Offices of the Bank,

organised workshops on government debt securities during

1999. Further, two half day work-shops were conducted by the

PDD in collaboration with the USAID for the PDs and

institutional investors.

The PDD obtained the services of a foreign consultant who

conducted several training sessions for the Bank staff, PDs and

institutional investors, during 1999. Further, initial steps were

taken by the PDD to obtain a consultancy service with World

Bank assistance to design a framework and system for PD

surveillance.

In order to improve the Central Bank's open market

operations and domestic debt management, the Monetary

Operations Unit (MOU) was replaced by three committees,

namely the Liquidity Assessment Committee (LAC), the Open

Market Operations Committee (OMOC) and the Domestic Debt

Management Committee (DDMC). These were established in

November 1999. The DDMC, chaired by the Superintendent

of Public Debt, was assigned the responsibility of making

recommendations on issues relating to the management of

domestic public debt. This Committee met once a week to

review the Treasury cash flow with a view to ascertaining the

borrowing requirements and determining the volume,

composition and the maturity structure of the issues of domestic

public debt securities.

With the objective of further developing the government

debt securities market, it was decided, in principle, that separate

legal entities be set up to undertake PD activities, and that these

entities should have an initial capital of Rs.150 million.

Accordingly, 14 PDs consisting of 7 commercial banks and 7

non-bank financial institutions agreed to form separate legal

entities with dedicated capital. Regulations to be promulgated

by the Hon. Minister Finance and Planning in terms of the

Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance and the Local

Treasury Bill Ordinance were drafted and guidelines to be

issued under these Regulations and criteria for appointment of

PDs were formulated during the year. The number of PDs

remained unchanged at 18 at end 1999, and there was also no

change in the composition of PDs which comprised 11

commercial banks and 7 non commercial bank financial

institutions.

With a view to making government debt securities more

market oriented, a significant proportion of debt was issued in

the form of Treasury bonds during 1999. A marketable, coupon

bearing, medium to long-term sovereign debt instrument, in the

form of Treasury bonds, was first introduced in March, 1997.

While Treasury bonds with maturities ranging from two years

to six years were issued in 1999, it is significant to note that

Treasury bonds with five and six year maturities were issued

for the first time in 1999. The issue of Treasury bonds with

longer maturities is expected to bring about greater stability to

the long-term debt securities market.

Within a short period of time since the first issue in 1997,

Treasury bonds have become a popular debt security among

dealers for investment and a flexible instrument for trading in

the secondary market. The market determined yield rates of Treasury bonds, both in the primary and secondary markets, have enabled the establishment of a long term yield curve, thus providing bench mark yield rates for corporate debt securities.

Operational Activities

The total outstanding gross public debt serviced by the PDD at end 1999 amounted to Rs. 1,004,822 million. This indicated an increase of Rs.l 17,271 million or 13.2 per cent as compared with 1998. The public debt outstanding as at end 1999 consisted of Rs.491,937 million (49 per cent) of domestic debt and Rs.512,885 million (51 per cent) of foreign debt. The domestic component of public debt increased by Rs.72,437 million (17.3 percent) whilst foreign debt rose by Rs.44,834 million (9.6 per cent) over the level at end 1998.

Treasury Bills

Total Treasury bills outstanding at end 1999 was Rs. 124,996 million as compared with Rs.l 19,996 million at end 1998. This increase was due to new issues of Rs.5,000 million of Treasury bills to the Central Bank during 1999. The authorised limit of Treasury bills remained unchanged at Rs. 125,000 million during the year.

The Monetary Operations Unit (MOU) serviced by the Public Debt, Banking and Economic Research Departments, which functioned till end of November 1999, continued to make recommendations on the amounts of Treasury bills to be offered in the weekly primary auctions, their maturity distribution and any advance reservation of Treasury bills to the Central Bank and the maturity structure of Treasury bills purchased by the Central Bank at primary auctions. It also formulated the Rupee loan and Treasury bond programmes on a monthly basis and made recommendations to the Monetary Board. Since December 1999 the functions of the MOU have been performed by the newly formed Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC).

Access to primary auctions of Treasury bills was confined to the PDs with the exception of funds managed by the Central Bank who were allowed to purchase Treasury bills at the weighted average yield rate. Total sales of Treasury bills at primary auctions amounted to Rs.214,290 million during 1999. The commercial bank PDs, (the largest single category of buyers of Treasury bills at the primary market) purchased

Rs. 134,745 million or 62.9 per cent of total sales, followed by non-bank PDs who purchased 14 per cent. In 1999, the Central Bank managed funds accounted for 4.6 per cent of the bids accepted at primary auctions. The total amount of Treasury bills purchased by the Central Bank during the year amounted to Rs.39,725 million or 18.5 per cent of the total. Table 11-19

The Centre for Banking Studies

The Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) continued to offer

training programmes for officials in the financial sector to equip

them with necessary skills to meet the challenges arising from

the changing environment. CBS also provided training

programmes to public sector officials engaged in financial

management. In 1999, CBS conducted 71 training programmes

covering 2,328 training hours for 1,842 participants. About half

of the participants, numbering 924, were from the Central Bank,

while 29 per cent of participants were from commercial banks.

The rest of the participants were drawn from the Regional Rural

Development Banks and Regional Development Banks (6 per

cent) and Ministries and other financial institutions (15 per

cent). In the year 1999, several officials of Central Banks in

the SAARC region also participated in CBS training

programmes.

The focus of the training programmes in 1999 was on

banking supervision and regulation to create sound financial

systems and management. Accordingly, coverage of the training

programmes was expanded to include Banking Supervision

Techniques, Risk-based Supervision, Risk Management and

Internal Controls. These topics were covered in a series of

short-term training courses and seminars. In addition, several

other training programmes were offered on new and re-oriented

themes.

For the second successive year, CBS conducted its

diploma courses on Central Banking and Commercial Banking.

In 1999, there were 16 computer training courses designed to

train mainly the Central Bank employees on the use of personal

computers. These training courses included certificate courses

in application software for new recruits to the Central Bank and

special programmes for newly recruited trainee fund managers

of the Employees' Provident Fund Department. CBS conducted

fifteen skills development programmes, of which three were

exclusively for the officers of the Currency Department of the

Central Bank.

Specially designed programmes were offered primarily for

the staff of the Regional Rural Development Banks and

Regional Development Banks. These training programmes were

on the subjects of Lending on Pledge of Jewellery, Project

Appraisal, Identification and Rehabilitation of Sick Projects and

Accounting Procedures. Other training programmes which

Banking and Financial Services. The participants in these

courses were officers of the Bank Supervision Dept. The

remaining 9 programmes included seminars on Swaps and

Derivatives, Taxation and Fiscal Policy, World Bank

Procurement Rules, and Money Laundering as well as

Orientation Programmes conducted for the new recruits to the

Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance. In 1999, CBS also

co-ordinated the SEACEN seminar on 'Systemic Financial

Sector Restructuring and Macroeconomic Policy in the

SEACEN Countries' hosted by the Central Bank in Colombo.

CBS also organised several commemoration lectures and

public seminars/lectures in 1999. The commemoration lectures

were designed to disseminate new ideas and to provide a forum

for professionals and academics in the relevant fields to

exchange views and share experiences on issues pertaining to

economic and financial sector developments. Three

are given in Table 11-28.

The Self Access Centre (SAC) of CBS continued to offer

its facilities to Central Bank employees to improve their

knowledge of English. To supplement these facilities, classes

were also held on oral communication and writing reports. The

CBS Library continued to provide its services to Central Bank staff, trainees and researchers from other institutions. The

library added 325 new books to its collection and subscribed

to 52 periodicals.

Secretariat

The administrative services to the Bank in the areas of finance,

supplies and travel etc. were provided by the Bank's Secretariat

Department.

In 1999, a system of self-monitoring of departmental

expenditure was introduced by issuing guidelines to the

departments of the Bank, in addition to the control of

expenditure through the Bank's budget. The budget ensures

strict financial controls over expenditure within the framework

of the corporate plan of the Bank. Expenditure of the Bank is

monitored in relation to the budget in order to achieve efficient

use of funds and cost effectiveness.

The preparation of the income and expenditure budget for

capital and administrative expenditure is co-ordinated by the

Secretariat Department and is based on information furnished

by the Bank's departments with regard to expenditure to be

incurred by each department during the year. The requests of

the departments are reviewed by a Budget Review Committee

consisting of senior officers of the Bank before the budget is

finalised and the approval of the Monetary Board is obtained

for it. Any expenditure that may arise during the course of the

year for which no provision is made in the budget could be

incurred only with the specific approval of the Monetary Board.

The total administrative expenditure in 1999 amounted to

Rs. 1,567 million, and notes and coin issue expenses were

Rs.772 million. Of the total administrative expenditure, the

personnel cost, which includes salaries, allowances, overtime

payments and medical benefits, amounted to Rs. 1,203 million

or 76.8 per cent, while the administrative and the establishment

costs amounted to Rs.170 million or 10.8 percent and Rs.194

million or 12.4 per cent, respectively.

The total staff strength of the Bank as end of 1999 was

2026, which included 546 Staff Officers. There were 60 retirees

from the Bank service during the year.

(XXXVIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

Capital expenditure in 1999 was Rs.2,909 million

compared with. Rs. 1,622 million in 1998. The bulk of the

expenditure, amounting to Rs.2,872 million, was for

construction of the New Extension Building and the

rehabilitation of the Old Building at Janadhipathi Mawatha. The

amounts spent on the New and the Old Buildings were Rs. 1,275

million and Rs 1,597 million respectively. The Bank met the

cost of these building projects out of funds in the Bank's

Building Reserve account which had been fed with funds over

a period of time by transferring a part of the Bank's annual

profit to that account at the time profits were appropriated each

year. The other major capital projects undertaken by the Bank

were the installation of a new PABX system for the Bank and

the establishment of a back up site for the Sri Lanka Automated

Clearing House.

Legal

The Legal Department, which earlier functioned as a division

of the Secretariat Department, was established as a separate

department on 15 April 2000.

The Department attends to the legal work of the Bank and

advises the other Departments of the Bank on legal issues. It

also attends to litigation in court and legal matters before other

fora. In addition to such work of a routine nature, the

Department was associated in 1999 in preparing preliminary

drafts of legislation, including those relating to amendments to

the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988, the Monetary Law Act

(Cap. 422) and fresh legislation in respect of finance leasing

and prevention of money laundering.

Premises

During the year 1999, the Premises Department continued the maintenance work and up-keeping of the premises taken on lease to accommodate the Bank's Head Office until the completion of the extension building and rehabilitation work of the Old Head Office building, and also the Central Bank's own premises. The maintenance and up-keep of the new extension building was also undertaken by the Premises Department in November/December 1999. In addition, the Department continued to provide support services, such as transport and communication facilities to the Bank.

In the second half of 1999, the department commenced modifications to the second hostel block at the Centre for Banking Studies. The Department also commenced conservation work on the Chatham Street Light House Clock Tower in the last quarter of 1999 in consultation with the Department of Archaeology and the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau. The maintenance of the Clock Tower by the Bank eliminated a security risk the Bank may have had to face if outsiders were in charge of the work.

New Buildings

The New Buildings Department which was established on 18

November 1997, is entrusted with the task of attending to work

connected with the construction of the Central Bank Extension

Building and the rehabilitation of the damaged old Headquarters

building at Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo.

Extension to the Central Bank Building

The construction work of the Extension to the Central Bank

Building was substantially completed. All departments located

in the World Trade Center moved into the Extension Building

in November and December 1999.

The Extension Building comprises two main towers each

containing fifteen floors (inclusive of basement and mezzanine

floors). The building covers a total office and ancillary floor

area of approximately 202,360 sq.ft. and is served by four

passenger lifts and three other special purpose lifts. The offices

in the building are linked to an integrated modern

telecommunication system. The Centre for Banking Studies

(CBS) and the Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House (SLACH)

are also linked to this integrated system. A Money Museum

will be established on the ground floor of the building.

Rehabilitation of the Damaged Building

The rehabilitation work of the damaged Central Bank building,

which commenced in December 1997 continued during 1999.

The repaired building will be fully integrated with the extension

building and will, among other things, have a modern

conference hall.

At the end of 1999, the progress in respect of major areas

of work were as follows :-

Progress

Demolition - 100% completed

Structural Repairs - 100% completed New Concrete Works - 100% completed Mechanical & Electrical - 75% completed Finishing Works - 80% completed

Overall completion - 80% completed

The rehabilitation work in the building is expected to be

completed by the middle of 2000.

Security Services

The Security Services Department provided security for all operations of the Bank, including special assignments such as shifting of offices to the new building and the transport of currency to Regional Offices and other locations where currency operations are carried out. On a regular basis, security officers were detailed for duty at various locations where the Bank's operations were carried out, including the Regional Offices at Anuradhapura and Matara.

(XXXIX)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

In addition to the above, additional security measures were

taken in liaison with government security and intelligence

agencies. Further, a scheme was implemented to provide

security for the transport of building materials and water to the

construction site at Janadhipathi Mawatha.

Information

The dissemination of information pertaining to matters of the Bank among the Bank's personnel and the public through the multi-media is the function of the Information Department of the Bank. The Information Department acts as a collector, storer and disseminator of information.

In the dissemination of information within the Bank, an Internal Newsletter was published fortnightly throughout the year under review.

In the dissemination of information to the outside world, the department released, on a regular basis, the daily exchange rates, weekly and monthly economic indicators, consumer price indices, information on domestic debt instruments such as Treasury bills, Treasury bonds and Rupee loans, to the print and electronic media. The department was also responsible for the issue of press releases and for organising press conferences on matters of public interest and the issue of the Bank's Annual Report, Consumer Finance and Socio Economic Survey report, Sri Lanka Socio Economic Data, the Monthly Bulletin, Economic and Social Statistics, Satahana and the News Survey. The Department also produced Tsuru Woman', a documentary video programme on 'Empowerment of Woman' under the Isuru Loan Project undertaken by the Rural Credit Department.

Other services provided by the Information Department includes printing of publications for the Bank and the Government at the Bank's printing press, and providing the services of a photographer and an artist.

The Information Department is also actively involved in the Bank's Heritage Project set up to collect items of historical interest pertaining to the Bank.

The Printing Press of the Central Bank continued to meet the bulk of the printing requirements of the Bank. In addition to the regular Central Bank publications such as the English version of the Annual Report, Satahana and News Survey, the Press undertook the printing of the publication 'Trends in Public Finance' for the Ministry of Finance and Planning. The printing of seven volumes of 'Laws Relating to Banking and Finance in Sri Lanka', which consolidated the laws governing the banking and financial sector, was also undertaken by the press.

The Library

The Library which had to be rebuilt after its destruction in January 1996, moved into is permanent premises in the new Central Bank Headquarters Building in November 1999. Further, a project launched with assistance from the World Bank to create a new technologically sophisticated modern library and information facility so as to support the research and information requirements of the Central Bank staff as well

as to provide facilities for economic research in the country

neared completion at the end of the year.

The library has built up a collection of 7,862 books, 385

periodical titles and over 131 CD ROMs as at December 1999.

The Library provides the following services:

• current articles - titles with abstracts

• web alert service

• current news on banking and finance around the

world

• compilation of special bibliographies

The Library also provided repographic services, reference

services, lending services, internet searching to the Bank Staff

and inter-library loan facilities.

During the year under review, the services of two

consultants were obtained for the programmes on modernisation

and capacity building of the Library. A software package named

'LIBSYS' was installed and the Library was connected to a

Local Area Network and Library operations were automated.

Information Technology

The main activities of the Bank's Information Technology

Department during the year under review involved the

development of required infrastructure for making the day to

day operations of the Central Bank more efficient using

computer technology, and the monitoring of the Y2K

compliance programme of commercial banks, specialised banks

and the Central Bank.

The Department continued to develop several AS/400 and

personal computer based systems. An on-line real time current

account system developed for the Banking Department was

made fully operational in January 1999. This system is a

prerequisite for the introduction of an Electronic Funds Transfer

system for developing the government debt securities market.

A monitoring system for the release of foreign exchange was

also developed for the Exchange Control Department.

A system was developed and implemented to collect

provident fund contributions from employers through the

electronic media, where the EPF Department creates a direct

debit on information provided by them and using the SLIPS

(Sri Lanka Inter-bank Payment System) at the SLACH, debits

the employer's account at a bank and credits the proceeds to

the employees' accounts at the EPF Department. This is the

first time the direct debit facility of the SLIPS has been used

and it is expected to improve the efficiency and accuracy of

collecting funds and crediting contributions to member

accounts.

A computer system was implemented at the Labour

Department to process refund applications and trigger necessary

action to make payments to the beneficiary. This uses

telecommunication lines for data transfer between the Labour

Department and the EPF Department. The process of mid-year

printing of statements was also implemented for the first time.

Y2K Project

The Y2K compliance project of the Central Bank involved the

testing of all AS/400 and PC based computer systems. Some

PC based systems were made Y2K compliant by effecting the

necessary modifications.

The Department was also responsible for the development

of departmental contingency plans and, at a macro level, an

overall plan for the Central Bank. This contingency plan can

be made use of in the event the main site becomes inaccessible.

Further, the Department together with the Bank

Supervision Department monitored Y2K related activities of all

commercial and specialised banks to ensure adequate

preparations for the year 2000 rollover.

A workshop for 60 officers of all banks was organised to

develop standard procedures for Y2K testing, based on Bank

of England guidelines. A further workshop was organised for

40 bank officers for contingency planning. The World Bank

funded these two workshops for which resource personnel were

obtained from a consultancy firm in Ireland. Further, with

financial assistance from the World Bank, the services of two

reputed international audit firms were obtained to audit the Y2K

projects of domestic and specialised banks and the Central Bank

and to report periodically on the project status. The Information

Technology Department also prepared a contingency plan for

the banking sector. An Event Management Centre, for

monitoring the rollover to year 2000 of local banks and related

events was also established in the Department. The Centre was

manned by personnel from the Bank Supervision Department

and the Information Technology Department.

Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House (SLACH)

During the year under review, the volume of cheques processed by SLACH was 32,764,350 with a daily average of 134,833, which is an increase of 1,407,810 from 1998. Despite the increase in cheque volumes, SLACH has been able to process them without increasing staff, thereby minimising operational costs.

The Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLIPS) has seen a significant increase of 68 per cent in the transactions processed. Furthermore, the direct debit system, which authorises the debiting of one's funds up to a limit and crediting to a beneficiary account through the SLIPS system was introduced, and is used by EPF for collecting contributions from employers.

In October 1999, in view of the crucial nature of its operations, the SLACH set up a second site to ensure the continuity of operations in the event of a disruption at the main site.

The SLACH achieved Year 2000 compliance and helped the banking sector rollover to Year 2000 successfully.

Management Audit

In accordance with the annual audit programme of the Bank, the Management Audit Department carried out its internal audit and management service functions during 1999 with the objective of increasing the efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the performance of the Central Bank.

During the year, the Department audited about 85 million unserviceable and damaged currency notes of various denominations prior to their destruction. The destruction processes of shredding and burning of unserviceable currency notes were supervised in order to ensure that they were properly carried out.

The Department also carried out the annual verification of stocks of currency notes and coins held in the Central Bank vaults in Colombo and in the Regional Offices. The stock registers of currency were checked and certified by the audit officers after reconciling receipts and issues. In addition, the Department carried out surprise checks on 15 occasions at the public exchange counters of the Currency Department. The Department also supervised the destruction of the remaining waste material after the printing of currency notes by De La Rue Lanka Currency & Security Print (Pvt.) Ltd., and pre-audited the payments made to this Company for supply of currency notes. Operations of the Banking Department were also post audited with a view to ensuring accuracy of transactions and records.

In addition to auditing of all emoluments paid to Bank employees, the annual financial statements prepared by the Secretariat and Welfare Departments relating to the Pension Fund, Provident Fund, Widows' and Orphans' and Widowers' and Orphans' Pension Funds and other welfare schemes of the Central Bank were pre-audited. The income and expenditure statements of the Centre for Banking Studies and the Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House were also pre-audited before submission to the Management. Deficiencies in the statements were pointed out and rectified and procedural and policy issues that arose in these areas were attended to.

Audits were conducted on the computation of provident fund balances and pensions of Central Bank employees on termination of their employment, to ensure accuracy and recovery of all liabilities due to the Bank. All loans granted under the welfare schemes and records relating to concessionary travel facilities, medical benefit scheme and the activities of the Central Bank canteen were audited.

Further, all refunds made to the beneficiaries of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) were pre-audited and statements of annual accounts of the EPF were also audited.

All payments made under the New Extension Building and the Rehabilitation of the Head Office Building Projects of the Central Bank and the expenses incurred by the Secretariat and Premises Departments for purchase of goods and services and for maintenance of vehicles were also audited. Further, leave records of all employees of the Central Bank were also post-audited.

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

Welfare

The welfare facilities provided by the Bank to the staff are

administered by the Welfare Department of the Bank. Medical

facilities to the staff and their registered dependants and

pensioners and their spouses, as well as to victims of the bomb

explosion, continued to be provided. Several concessional loan

schemes for housing, purchase of vehicles and other purposes

were made available to employees. The size of the vehicle loan

and the Staff Benefit Scheme (Category B) loan was increased

during the year.

The subsidised Railway and Bus Season Ticket Scheme

and the Railway Warrant Scheme continued as in the past.

However, the provision of canteen facilities remained limited,

as the departments of the Bank were located in several places.

Canteen facilities were provided, as far as possible, having

regard to the circumstances.

The Central Bank Medical Clinic continued to provide

in-house medical facilities during working hours.

The computerisation of welfare administration continued

with improved facilities in the accounting and payment system.

This has improved the efficiency of the department and reduced

the cost involved in welfare management.

Personnel

The Establishments Department continued to perform its functions with regard to recruitments, appointments, promotions, retirements and other related matters during 1999 in keeping with its vision of "maintaining a competent and capable work force developed to its true potential, with an ability to clearly understand their role and responsibilities and discharge them efficiently and effectively and meet unhesitantly the emerging needs and challenges".

During 1999, a Chief Librarian and two Assistant Librarians were appointed to the Bank service. The services of two Consultants were also secured to undertake specific assignments on the Central Bank Heritage Project and the Central Bank Currency Museum.

The Department organized a workshop for the Deputy Heads of Departments at the Centre for Banking Studies during 1 6 - 1 7 January 1999. The workshop highlighted the challenges and prospects for Year 2000 and beyond and matters relating to leading subordinates in organizations and the scientific approach to preparation of job descriptions and performance appraisal.

In October 1999 an Open Competitive Examination was conducted by the Post Graduate Institute of Management of Sri Jayawardenapura University to select suitable persons for appointment to Staff Class from among candidates who had applied in response to a press advertisement.

During the year,, the Department continued with the evaluation of the performance of employees on the basis of the new performance evaluation scheme introduced in 1998 on trial basis.
