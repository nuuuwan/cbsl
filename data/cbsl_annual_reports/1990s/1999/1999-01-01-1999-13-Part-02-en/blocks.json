This was mainly due to the increase in the Treasury bills holding of the Bank as a part of its Open Market Operations implemented with a view to reduce the tightness of rupee liquidity associated with Y2K concerns and the end-year seasonal factors. The medium and long-term credit facilities granted to commercial banks and other credit institutions, on the other hand, declined by 32.9 per cent in 1999, partly due to repayments of such loans and partly due to the provisions made for non-performing loans. Short-term advances to commercial banks also declined by 51.2 per cent in 1999.'",

Hence, the total loan disbursements from the inception of the projects amounted to only Rs.l.6 million. Considering this poor performance, a team of consultants engaged by the ADB to study the issues involved had reported that PCIs should be provided with refinance to fund sub-loans. Accordingly, the possibility of refinancing sub-loans by using the funds of the National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) was explored by the Bank during 1999. The negotiations with the NDTF for this purpose proved successful and refinancing sub-loans through the NDTF is expected to commence shortly.",

The project relies on the credit plus approach which includes the linkage banking system, strengthened by the group lending strategy to achieve its objectives. The Central Bank functions as the executing agency of the Project on behalf of the Government. Although foreign funding for the Project was closed in December 1997 as originally scheduled after achieving the targets set for the Project at the design stage, the Project activities continued to be carried on by the Bank during 1999 by recycling the loan recoveries as provided for in the Loan Agreement signed with IFAD.",

    "text": "The EPF also commenced investing in the equity market in 1998 as a part of its strategy to diversify its investment portfolio. These investments were continued during the year under review on a very modest scale, selecting only good stocks for investment. Table H-15 below presents the position of the equity investments as at the end of 1999, together with the return from them. Though the operation was very modest, the equity portfolio yielded a rate of return of 28 per cent during the year.",
