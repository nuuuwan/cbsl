    "text": "1 Financial markets displayed some instability in the latter part of 1997 and in the first half of 1998 as a consequence of the uncertainties generated by the East Asian financial crisis. However, a significant degree of stability was achieved by the second half of 1998, and this relative stability generally continued into 1999. With the exception of a short period in April, when market uncertainty increased and interest rates fluctuated considerably as a result of elections and labour unrest, both the call market and the exchange market exhibited a healthy degree of stability. This stability and the continuous decline in inflation enabled the Central Bank to relax its monetary stance somewhat in the second half of the year. However, the relaxation was carried out cautiously, so as to avoid the possibility of a re-emergence of inflationary pressure or the possibility of instability in the foreign exchange market. The additional liquidity the market received through this relaxation served primarily to offset the drain of liquidity caused by the outflow in the balance of payments. The combination of several factors, viz., seasonal volatility, elections and the Year 2000 issue, presented challenges to policy markers in maintaining market stability in December. Open market operations continued to be the major tool for implementing monetary policy and the Central Bank's repurchase (repo) rate and the reverse repurchase (reverse repo) rate were the primary means of conveying signals to the market. As a further step in improving the market orientation of the monetary policy mechanism, by reducing the use of direct instruments, the statutory reserve requirement (SRR) was reduced in August. The Bank Rate was reduced, by one percentage point, to 16 per cent.",

    "text": "An important change in monetary policy was the reduction, in August 1999, of the SRR on rupee deposits and foreign currency deposits lent domestically from 12 per cent to 11 per cent. In addition to reducing the Central Bank's reliance on the SRR as a monetary policy tool, the reduction would also reduce the effective cost of funds of commercial banks and enable them to reduce their lending rates. This measure resulted in a release of around Rs.2,000-2,500 million of funds sterilised by the Central Bank to the market. The expansionary impact of this release was judged not to be adverse, as it primarily offset the contractionary effect of a deficit in the balance of payments on market liquidity. It had the added advantage of mitigating any crowding out effect that would result from the increased credit obtained by government from the banking sector.",

The combination of seasonal fluctuations, Presidential elections and the uncertainties connected with the Year 2000 issue created an environment where the possibility of market volatility, particularly in interest rates, was likely. The Central Bank used its operations in the primary market for Treasury bills and its operations in the secondary market to provide additional liquidity to the market. In order to avoid any excessive increase in interest rates due to market aberrations, the interest rate applicable to the Bank's reverse repurchase facility was maintained at a fixed level throughout the second half of December. In addition, the tenor of reverse repurchase transactions, which is usually restricted to one day, was extended upto 30 days. Further, the Bank purchased Treasury bills at the primary auctions. These measures achieved their objectives by providing confidence to the market and prevented any undue pressure on interest rates or excessive volatility in liquidity.",

Its increasing popularity has also been nourished by a growing consensus on the fact that there is no long-term trade-off between inflation and output and_ that price-stability fosters 'economic growth.",

While the ultimate objective is supporting economic growth through the promotion of monetary and price stability, there is no explicit inflation targeting framework used; in the conduct of monetary policy. If Sri Lanka is to adopt inflation targeting there would be a need to a clear commitment-for- the Central Bank to allow the exchange rate to float freely instead of the current managed float. Existing high fiscal deficits make it impractical to ignore the reality of the financing needs of the government in the conduct of monetary policy. While policy instruments should be effective in influencing the economy, money and capital markets must be sufficiently developed so as to react quickly to the use of such instruments. Questions however, remain as to whether the effects of policy actions could efficiently be transmitted to target variables in the somewhat rigid market conditions that prevail, particularly in respect of lending rates.

The Central Bank's overnight repo rate and reverse repo rate served as the primary ^signalling mechanism for the expected direction of market interest rates and were instrumental in restraining volatility in the call money market. Over-subscriptions at all Treasury bill auctions, excluding one, and at all Treasury bond auctions reflected the improved liquidity conditions in the market throughout the year. This availability of liquidity partly caused by slower growth in private sector credit and declining inflation, helped to keep yields on government paper stable, despite increased borrowing by the government.

This is in contrast to 1998, when increased profits enabled government corporations to reduce their liabilities to banks. Net credit to the government from commercial banks increased in 1999. Increased government expenditure, partly in respect of capital projects, and reduced inflows of foreign funds led to the government having greater recourse to the domestic banking system to obtain funds. In terms of total value, the largest growth in assets was increased provision of credit to the private sector.",

In order to offset the impact of shortage of liquidity resulting from the outflow in the balance of payments and the need to ensure adequate liquidity in the market to facilitate economic activity, the Central Bank provided liquidity through its operations in the primary and secondary markets for government securities. Consequent on this and the desire on the part of commercial banks to hold higher cash balances at the end of the year, largely due to Y2K related issues, the Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank increased significantly by Rs.16,933 million in 1999.",

The government repealed the Agriculture Insurance Law No.27 of 1973 and enacted new legislation - the Agriculture and Agrarian Services Act No.20 of 1999 (See Box 3 for details). Second, for the first time in the history of agrarian services in the country, steps were taken to rely on the private sector to provide extension services for the agricultural sector. This was to be achieved as a pilot scheme under the Second Perennial Crops Development Project funded by the ADB. The objective of the new policy measure was to provide a more effective extension service to farmers through a 'user payee' system, thereby developing a market based extension service in the country.",

While continuing its former business, steps were taken by the new AAIB to design new insurance schemes for seed farms, model farms, seed stores, livestock, fisheries,^ floriculture and coconut. The insurance schemes designed by the AAIB on the request of the Perennial Crops Development Project for perennial crops, Department of Export Agriculture for export agriculture crops, Southern Development Authority for maize cultivation in the Southern region and the Tea Research Institute and Tea Small Holding Development Authority for smallholder tea plantation continued to be in operation during the year under review.

    "text": "The extent of paddy land insured by the AAIB in 1999 amounted to 11,000 hectares when compared to 14,000 hectares in 1998. This reduction has mainly been due to the difficulties in providing coverage for paddy lands in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country and a fall in the volume of loans granted under the NCRCS. Out of the districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces, AAIB could cover only a limited land area in the districts of Jaffna, Ampara, Batticaloa and Vavuniya. Insurance coverage for paddy and subsidiary food crops in the other parts in these districts was not provided by the AAIB. Therefore, the insurance premia collected and indemnities paid under paddy stood at Rs.6.7 million and Rs.1.5 million, respectively, during the year. The area insured under other crops by the AAIB stood at 2,138 hectares. The premia collected in this field was Rs.1.3 million. The amount of indemnities paid for other crops was Rs.0.3 million. The CICL insured an extent of 2,672 hectares of paddy land and collected premia to a value of Rs.2.4 million. The payment of indemnity for paddy farmers stood at Rs.0.4 million. In",

These programmes were supported by action programmes that included mobile libraries to promote reading habits, home-gardening, dairy farming and anti-drug campaigns. The beneficiaries are taken through a social mobilisation programme that help them to develop habits of thrift and leadership capabilities and achieve both social and human development through a participatory approach. The microfinance programme that provided small loans with minimal procedures, but on market interest rates, helped the beneficiary women to free themselves from the clutches of the village money lenders.",

The objective of the GPS is to develop the potential micro scale borrowers and provide financial facilities to strengthen their existing economic activities and create new avenues for income generation. The total cumulative amount of loans granted under the scheme upto the end of 1999 amounted to Rs.1.2 billion covering 32,505 small and micro projects throughout the country. The outstanding loan balance at end 1999 stood at Rs.283 million in respect of 9,876 current projects. The scheme has maintained a recovery rate of 97 per cent, a very satisfactory record for a high risk micro-finance activity. The GPS also mobilised savings to a value of Rs.700 million during the entire project period.",

These banks were primarily the banking arms of the Multi\u00adpurpose Co-operative Societies (MPCSs), which had spread their business activities to almost all the sectors in the economy. Since the establishment of People's Bank in 1962, CRBs were nurtured by that Bank providing a host of services, banking facilities, supervision of activities, training of personnel and absorption of surplus funds. Hence, CRBs continued to play a vital role in retailing agricultural credit among rural farmers as a junior partner of People's Bank until the early 1990s. However, this relationship came under strain after People's Bank gradually moved into commercial banking proper, leaving CRBs in a state of isolation. Hence, to fill the vacuum, it was necessary to set up some kind of an apex institution to lead CRBs to play their role as viable retail banking institutions.",

The functions of DCBUs are to accept deposits from MPCSs, grant loans to MPCSs and invest their excess funds in suitable investments. Loans were granted to MPCSs for both working capital and investment capital purposes. The working capital loans were granted for settling bank loans, promoting customer activities, purchase of paddy etc. Investment capital loans were granted for the purchase of buildings, vehicles and equipment. The average interest rate charged from MPCSs stood between 12 per cent and 14 per cent, a concessionary rate when compared with prevailing market rates.",

The main activities of the CRBs were mobilisation of savings, extension of credit, engagement in pawning activities, collection of utility bills such as electricity bills, payment of salaries to school teachers and payment of pensions to farmers. At end 1999, CRBs had over 5.3 million savings accounts recording an increase of 12 per cent during the year. The deposits of CRBs also increased, by 15 per cent, from Rs. 11,234 million in 1998 to Rs. 12,914.7 million in 1999. Though the total deposit base showed an appreciable increase during 1999, trie fixed deposit component remained more or less stagnant; due to the failure of CRBs to compete effectively with other financial institutions which offered more attractive long term savings products.",

On the loan portfolio side, a similar picture was also shown, with 1.2 million borrowers receiving an average loan size of Rs.5,874 per borrower. Though it is encouraging for CRBs to cater to the lowest stratum of the depositors and borrowers in the rural areas, the high administration costs of handling such a voluminous number of accounts will undoubtedly erode the viability and solvency of CRBs in the long run.",

These purchases included Treasury bills reserved for the Central Bank, amounting to Rs.22,800 million in 1999 compared to Rs. 11,600 million, in 1998, at the primary Treasury bill auctions. There were three special issues amounting to Rs.5,000 million, which were purchased entirely by the Central Bank. These operations resulted in the book value of the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills increasing from Rs.8,233 million at end 1998 to Rs.25,165 million at end 1999. It should be noted that a significant portion of this increase was in December, as the Bank injected liquidity into the market to provide stability in the context of the Year 2000 problem.",

Many Asian and international markets improved during the year as the East Asian countries recovered from the financial crisis in 1997 and 1998. However, a corresponding improvement was not seen in the Sri Lankan market. Market sources attributed this to the uncertainty associated with elections and the poor performance of some major listed companies during the first half of the year. Of the 16 sectors in the market, only 5 sectors showed an improvement in prices during the year. The All Share Price Index declined by 4.2 per cent and the new price index, the Milanka Price Index, introduced in place of the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) with effect from 4 January 1999 (1998=1000), declined by 6.2 per cent. However, the decline in prices was less than in 1998, which recorded a 15 per cent decline in the ASPI and a 13 per cent decline in the SPI.

In selecting companies to be included in the MPI, the major criteria used were market size, which is measured by market capitalisation, and liquidity, which is the frequency of transactions. In addition, the returns on shares, which is the difference between the nominal price and market price, the dividend record of the company and the earnings per share have also been taken into consideration. Based on these factors, 25 companies are included in the MPI. The sectors represented in the MPI include banks, finance and insurance, beverages, food and tobacco, construction and engineering, diversified, hotels and travels, manufacturing and plantations. These 25 companies account for approximately 10 per cent of all listed companies and 55 per cent of the total market capitalisation. The CSE plans to revise the companies included in the MPI annually. According to a study done by the CSE, the correlation between the ASPI and the MPI is 99.5 per cent, which shows that the MPI reflects the movement of the market.",

    "text": "Another major development in the Treasury bond market in 1999 was the issue of longer maturities of Treasury bonds, viz., 5-year and 6-year Treasury bonds, in March 1999 and in September 1999, respectively. This was a further step in providing a medium-term risk free yield curve. The coupon rates for these issues were 11.75 per cent and 12.00 per cent, respectively. Jumbo issues which were introduced in 1998, continued in 1999 with the issues of 18 series of Treasury bonds. These issues comprised 4 series of 2-year bonds (13 issues), 6 series of 3-year bonds (24 issues), 5 series of 4-year bonds (17 issues), 2 series of 5-year bonds (7 issues) and 1 series of 6-year bonds (one issue) during the year. In contrast to the rising trend observed in 1998, yield rates on Treasury bonds were relatively stable in 1999. The yield on 2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year Treasury bonds were in the ranges of 12.64-13.42 per cent, 12.79-13.95 per cent and 13.21-14.02 per cent and 13.30-13.97 per cent, respectively. The yield on 6-year bonds at the single auction held for that maturity was 13.65 per cent. The total gross value of Treasury bonds issued under the different series amounted to Rs.63,452 million in 1999, while Treasury bonds are gradually replacing Rupee loans as the means by which the government borrows long-term. New Treasury bond issues, which amounted to Rs. 10,000 million in 1997, were Rs.28,915 in 1998 and Rs.55,952 in 1999. At end 1999, the total value of outstanding Treasury bonds stood at Rs.l 13,822 million. Reverse repo transactions in Treasury bonds at the Central Bank secondary window increased substantially from Rs.381 million in 1998 to Rs.75,634 million in 1999.",

In addition to the initial rating fee, regular borrowers in international debt markets are required to pay an annual fee for the review and maintenance of rating. Sometimes these fees are waived or are subject to concessions, depending on the frequency of debt issues. There are also other fees, generally linked to the size of the issue.",
