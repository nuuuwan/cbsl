10. FINANCIAL SECTOR

10.1 Monetary Policy

A sharp fall in inflation, a significant deficit in the overall balance of payment, increased government borrowings and potential problems related to the Year 2000 date change were the major challenges faced in designing and implementing monetary policy in 1999. In this environment, monetary policy continued to focus on maintaining stability in the financial market. Further efforts were made to enhance the market orientation of the instruments of

monetary policy.

i

1 Financial markets displayed some instability in the latter part of 1997 and in the first half of 1998 as a consequence of the uncertainties generated by the East Asian financial crisis. However, a significant degree of stability was achieved by the second half of 1998, and this relative stability generally continued into 1999. With the exception of a short period in April, when market uncertainty increased and interest rates fluctuated considerably as a result of elections and labour unrest, both the call market and the exchange market exhibited a healthy degree of stability. This stability and the continuous decline in inflation enabled the Central Bank to relax its monetary stance somewhat in the second half of the year. However, the relaxation was carried out cautiously, so as to avoid the possibility of a re-emergence of inflationary pressure or the possibility of instability in the foreign exchange market. The additional liquidity the market received through this relaxation served primarily to offset the drain of liquidity caused by the outflow in the balance of payments. The combination of several factors, viz., seasonal volatility, elections and the Year 2000 issue, presented challenges to policy markers in maintaining market stability in December. Open market operations continued to be the major tool for implementing monetary policy and the Central Bank's repurchase (repo) rate and the reverse repurchase (reverse repo) rate were the primary means of conveying signals to the market. As a further step in improving the market orientation of the monetary policy mechanism, by reducing the use of direct instruments, the statutory reserve requirement (SRR) was reduced in August. The Bank Rate was reduced, by one percentage point, to 16 per cent.

' The Central Bank's views of the expected direction of interest rate movements were generally indicated to the market through the changes in its repo rate. The continuous sharp decline in inflation and the stability in the exchange market enabled the Bank to effect a 200 basis point reduction, in several steps, in the repo rate in 1999. The repo rate was reduced from 11.25 per cent at end 1998, to 9.25 per cent at end 1999. Some downward movement was

seen in most market interest rates. i

An important change in monetary policy was the reduction, in August 1999, of the SRR on rupee deposits and foreign currency deposits lent domestically from 12 per cent to 11 per cent. In addition to reducing the Central Bank's reliance on the SRR as a monetary policy tool, the reduction would also reduce the effective cost of funds of commercial banks and enable them to reduce their lending rates. This measure resulted in a release of around Rs.2,000-2,500 million of funds sterilised by the Central Bank to the market. The expansionary impact of this release was judged not to be adverse, as it primarily offset the contractionary effect of a deficit in the balance of payments on market liquidity. It had the added advantage of mitigating any crowding out effect that would result from the increased credit obtained by government from the banking sector.

Policy makers faced a challenging task in maintaining financial market stability in December. The combination of seasonal fluctuations, Presidential elections and the uncertainties connected with the Year 2000 issue created an environment where the possibility of market volatility, particularly in interest rates, was likely. The Central Bank used its operations in the primary market for Treasury bills and its operations in the secondary market to provide additional liquidity to the market. In order to avoid any excessive increase in interest rates due to market aberrations, the interest rate applicable to the Bank's reverse repurchase facility was maintained at a fixed level throughout the second half of December. In addition, the tenor of reverse repurchase transactions, which is usually restricted to one day, was extended upto 30 days. Further, the Bank purchased Treasury bills at the primary auctions. These measures achieved their objectives by providing confidence to the market and prevented any undue pressure on interest rates or excessive volatility in liquidity.

The Central Bank's own securities were available for mopping up operations or investment by commercial banks with surplus cash. However, as the Central Bank had sufficient government paper in its portfolio, these were not required by the market.

The policy of not granting refinance under the Medium and Long-Term Credit Fund or any other short-term facility was maintained, in order to avoid the market distorting effects of refinance. The outstanding amount of refinance granted in the past by the Central Bank declined from Rs. 1,122 million at the end of 1998 to Rs.748 million at the end of 1999.

10.2 Money Supply

The growth in money supply was relatively stable and

monetary aggregates moved within a comparatively narrow

range in 1999 as faster growth in domestic assets was partly

offset by a decline in net foreign assets. Consolidated broad

money (M 2 b), which includes the operations of foreign

currency banking units (FCBUs), had a monthly point to

point growth in the range of 13 - 15 per cent and ended

the year at 13.4 per cent. Narrow money (M) moved in a

slightly wider range of 8-14 per cent. The moving average

growth was more stable, with M moving within a range

of 13.2 per cent to 14.2 per cent and M within a range of

11-13 per cent. The greater volatility in Mt was due to an

increased demand for cash in April/May and November/

December due to market uncertainties and seasonal factors

discussed elsewhere.

Monetary expansion was held down by the decline in

net foreign assets of the banking system. The deficit in the

balance of payments was reflected in a reduction in the net

foreign assets of the monetary authorities by approximately

Rs. 12.5 billion. In contrast, the commercial banks built up

their foreign asset position. The FCBUs, in particular,

reduced their foreign currency exposure to the domestic-

sector, thus improving their net foreign assets. Some

increase in international rates, together with comparatively

low domestic rates reduced the interest differential in favour

of foreign currency lending in domestic entities. In addition,

the uncertainties caused by the East Asian crisis have made

banks cautious in lending in the region.

A sharp growth in net credit to the government

(NCG) and credit to government corporations, together with

continued credit expansion to the private sector, led to a

considerable increase in net domestic assets. Lower than

expected budgeted revenues, a shortfall in privatisation

proceeds and reduced foreign borrowing caused the

government to borrow more from the domestic banking

system. The larger portion of growth in NCG was from the

Central Bank as the Bank's holdings of government paper

increased substantially by approximately Rs.17,500 million.

Credit to government corporations increased sharply in

1999, in contrast to the decline in 1998. Increased

international oil prices, a growth in the use of domestic

funds for investment and expanded retail activity by some

key state corporations were the main causal factors for this

increase. Credit to the private sector showed a growth of

around 10 -14 per cent during the year. The contraction in

imports and exports and the slower overall growth in the

economy tended to exert a dampening effect on the demand

for credit. It should be noted however, that in addition to

Box 8 Inflation Targeting as a Framework for Monetary Policy

The concept of inflation targeting has become increasingly popular in both academic and policy circles since its introduction in New Zealand in 1990. Since then, a number of other industrial countries have also adopted this framework for monetary policy, in most cases after unsuccessful attempts to target some monetary aggregate or the nominal exchange rate. Its increasing popularity has also been nourished by a growing consensus on the fact that there is no long-term trade-off between inflation and output and_ that price-stability fosters 'economic growth.

In an inflation targeting framework the prime objective, is- the achievement of a specific inflation target which could be either a point target or a target band or could even be a ceiling (see Table below). The authorities typically set an inflation target for the medium term, often with annual intermediate targets. Regular forecasts of expected inflation are made and if the projected inflation over a medium term time horizon falls outside the announced range, a change in the monetary policy stance is indicated.

- " Inflation targeting is forward looking in nature and as such it is inherently non-transparent. This necessitates the need for compensating institutional features to, ensure a high degree of transparency of monetary policy and accountability of the central bank.

In many countries, which have adopted inflation targeting, steps have been taken to explain clearly the goals of monetary policy and describe and.justify5the policy measures being taken. Explanations of the actual performance of monetary policy and the dissemination of information relating to decisions on monetary policy to the public have also helped enhance the transparency of monetary policy. Inflation targeting also provides a yardstick against which a central bank's action can be evaluated. This, together with efforts to enhance the degree of transparency of monetary policy, implies that,central banks have:

naturally become more accountable for their actions under an inflation targeting framework.

There are several advantages of adopting inflation targeting as a framework for monetary policy over the targeting of monetary aggregates or the exchange rate. The main advantage is that an inflation targeting framework raises the probability of achieving and maintaining a low and stable rate of inflation, with potential beneficial effects on economic growth. ' This is facilitated by the reduced uncertainty among price and wage-setters about the future path of the inflation' rate emanating from the explicit mandate of. the central bank to achieve a target low inflation together with a high degree of transparency of monetary, policy and accountability.

An inflation targeting regime could also lead to a better cyclical adjustment of the economy as a typical inflation targeting framework enables a central bank to conduct a discretionary monetary policy with

a flexibility to deal with aggregate demand and supply shocks.; An inflation targeting framework also reduces the vulnerability of the domestic exchange rate to speculative attacks as the monetary authority does not Jiave a commitment to an exchange rate target and the exchange rate will be determined by market forces.

Another advantage is the greater flexibility in targeting inflation rate over other targeting mechanisms, which is achieved through several means. First, the price index on which the inflation targeting is based could be defined to exclude the effects of supply shocks. Second, the inflation target could be specified as a range rather than a point target (see Table above). This inflation target could be adjusted to accommodate the changes in the inflation rate due to supply shocks or other exogenous changes. The successful adaptation of an inflation targeting framework would eventually yield a more credible; and sustainable policy approach over other alternative policy regimes. .This could facilitate the operation of monetary policy itself and would also improve investor sentiments.

Yet, inflation targeting is not devoid of disadvantages: An inflation targeting framework does:: not guarantee that a,central bank-will successfully use its discretion for setting monetary policy appropriately as inflation targeting is more complicated and difficult to implement than targeting money growth or the exchange rate. The success of inflation targeting

i depends heavily on the central bank's ability to forecast' inflation accurately, and the availability of policy instruments that affect the inflation forecast with reasonable precision. In effect, the latter depends on the existence.of well developed capital and money

,;,marketsstwhich: facilitate the transmission of effects of:,

' policy actions to target variables.

Inflation targeting could also lead to inefficient output stabilisation, particularly in the event of large exogenous shocks. There could also be short-term output declines due to initial disinflation if the private : sector does not: consider the policy framework to be credible. These drawbacks however, could be reduced by introducing provisions to minimise such risks in the inflation targeting framework and also by targeting a sufficiently wide band:rather than a point target. The question: of policy credibility could be addressed by the government by explicitly endorsing the inflation targeting regime and taking efforts to consolidate fiscal

Box (contd.)

policy so as to eliminate fiscal dominance of monetary policy.

In such a scenario how would Sri Lanka fit into an inflation targeting framework? As mentioned earlier; the prerequisites needed to adopt an inflation targeting framework for monetary policy include i) a fair degree of independence ii) absence of. a commitment to target any other nominal variable, iii) absence of fiscal dominance of monetary policy iv) the ability of the central bank to forecast the inflation rate v) availability of policy instruments and vi) the existence of sufficiently developed capital and money markets.

At present, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka enjoys a fairly high degree of instrument independence, which enables it to use the policy instruments at its disposal in the pursuit of achieving the targeted inflation rate. Recently, Central Bank autonomy has been reiterated by the government, and action is being taken to amend the Central Bank law (the Monetary Law Act) to make price stability the prime objective of the Central Bank. These reflect the desire of both the government and the Central Bank to give priority to achieving price stability as a basis for sustainable economic growth. At present, the Central Bank targets the monetary

aggregates in the context of a financial programming exercise. Interest rate become an intermediate target! The Central Bank also intervenes in the exchange -market help maintain exchange rate stability as and when necessary. While the ultimate objective is supporting economic growth through the promotion of monetary and price stability, there is no explicit inflation targeting framework used; in the conduct of monetary policy. If Sri Lanka is to adopt inflation targeting there would be a need to a clear commitment-for- the Central Bank to allow the exchange rate to float freely instead of the current managed float. Existing high fiscal deficits make it impractical to ignore the reality of the financing needs of the government in the conduct of monetary policy. While policy instruments should be effective in influencing the economy, money and capital markets must be sufficiently developed so as to react quickly to the use of such instruments. Questions however, remain as to whether the effects of policy actions could efficiently be transmitted to target variables in the somewhat rigid market conditions that prevail, particularly in respect of lending rates. This may call for further financial sector reforms prior to the adoption of inflation.targeting in Sri Lanka. --w^'y.

There is also the need to develop a satisfactory forecasting framework and a forward looking

173

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

operations procedure to facilitate periodic assessments to expected inflation over the relevant time horizon, and systematic adjustments of monetary policy instruments to maintain the projected inflation rate in line with the target inflation. In this respect, the Central Bank has already taken steps to develop an econometric forecasting framework to guide its short term monetary policy objectives. It has been found that 60-70 per cent of the impact of money growth on inflation is felt with a lag of 8-9 months.

Country experiences suggest that the measure of inflation to target depends on individual country characteristics. While some countries have specified the inflation target in terms of 'headline' consumer

Box (contd.)

price index (CPI), others have used some form of 'underlying' inflation measures. The wide acceptance of the 'headline' CPI among the public and the psychological impact of an unfamiliar underlying inflation make the headline inflation a plausible candidate as the measure of the inflation rate, at least until a measure of underlying inflation becomes publicly available and widely accepted. This, however, would not be best suited in the medium to long-run as it could be quite volatile and adversely affect the public perception on Central Bank credibility. The risk of not being able to meet the specific inflation target could be minimised by having a target band instead of a point target.

sector from FCBUs declined in dollar terms. The reduced

attractiveness was also seen in the smaller amount granted

under the scheme of foreign currency loans to non-BOI

exporters (US dollars 177 million in 1998 as against US

dollars 124 million in 1999).

The Central Bank increased reserve money cautiously,

to avoid the resurgence of inflationary pressures. However,

a sufficient amount of reserve money was injected to

provide adequate liquidity to ensure the smooth functioning

of economic activity. Total reserve money increased by

Rs.7,578 million in 1999, in comparison to Rs.9,130 million

in 1998. The reduction of the SRR also helped to provide

additional liquidity of around Rs.2,000-2,500 million to the

market.

10.3 Interest Rates

Interest rates had relatively low volatility in 1999, and exhibited some downward movement. The reduction in interest rates was however, much less than the fall in inflation, resulting in an increase in real interest rates. The reduction in the SRR in August 1999 also helped to consolidate the stability of interest rates. The Central Bank's overnight repo rate and reverse repo rate served as the primary ^signalling mechanism for the expected direction of market interest rates and were instrumental in restraining volatility in the call money market. Over-subscriptions at all Treasury bill auctions, excluding one, and at all Treasury bond auctions reflected the improved liquidity conditions in the market throughout the year. This availability of liquidity partly caused by slower growth in private sector credit and declining inflation, helped to keep yields on government paper stable, despite increased borrowing by the government. The steady decline in inflation, enabled the Central Bank to reduce its overnight repo rate, which serves

as a leading indicator in determining other interest rates in

the market, in several steps in 1999.

Short-Term Interest Rates

Primary market yield rates on Treasury bills did not fluctuate greatly in 1999. A slight decline was seen, particularly around end of the third quarter of 1999. The 3-month Treasury bill rate, which was 12.01 per cent at end

1998, varied by less than 35 basis points in the first half of 1999 and then fell to 11.28 per cent by mid September

1999. A slight increase was seen in the third quarter, partly due to market uncertainties relating to the Year 2000 issue, and the 3-month yield rate rose to 11.79 per cent at end December 1999. In line with the same trend, the 6-month and 12-month Treasury bill rates decreased from 12.34 per cent and 12.59 per cent, respectively, at end 1998 to 11.79 per cent and 12.29 per cent at the beginning of September 1999, respectively, and then rose to 12.29 per cent and 12.77 per cent, respectively, at end 1999.

The other short-term rates, such as the discount rates and rediscount rates, repo and reverse repo rates offered by the Central Bank in the secondary market for its open market operations, which are generally linked to primary market interest rates varied within a relatively narrow range throughout the year. The 3-month discount rate was in a range of 11.13-11.86 per cent in 1999 while the 3-month rediscount rate varied in a range of 13.78-15.01 per cent. The maximum rates were witnessed at the beginning of the year 1999 while the minimum rates were recorded at mid September 1999. Following the same trend, the 12-month discount and rediscount rates fluctuated in narrow ranges during the year 1999. The 12-month discount rate, which was 12.41 per cent at the beginning of the year, declined gradually to 12.14 per cent in September, and then rose to 12.62 per cent at the end of the year, with slight fluctuations. Similarly, the 12-month Treasury bill rediscount rates also decreased to 14.79 per cent by early September 1999, before increasing to 15.27 per cent at end December 1999. The margin between the discount and the rediscount rate which was 3.15 per cent upto 06 May 1999, was reduced by 50 basis points to 2.65 per cent and was maintained at that level during the rest of the year.

In view of the declining interest rates and the stability of the foreign exchange market, the overnight repo rate, which is the Central Bank's main instrument for signalling the expected direction of the interest rates to the market, was reduced gradually several times during the year. The repo rate, which was 11.25 per cent at end 1998, was reduced by 25 basis points to 11.00 per cent on 06 January 1999 and then remained unchanged until 30 March 1999, when it was reduced by 10 basis points to 10.50 per cent. This level was maintained until mid June 1999. Following two downward revisions, 50 basis points on 30 July and 25 basis points on 17 November, it stood at 9.25 per cent at end December 1999.

Part I Central B a n k of Sri L a n k a A n n u a l Report - 1999

The reverse repurchase rate was generally adjusted in line with the movement in the 3-month Treasury bill yield rate during the year. It stood at 15.00 per cent at the beginning of the year 1999 and decreased to its lowest level of 13.41 per cent by mid December 1999. The Central Bank's reverse repo facility generally provides only for overnight reverse repo transactions. However, with effect from 21 December 1999, the tenor of reverse repo transactions was extended upto 30 days, in order to provide further stability to the money market in the context of the uncertainties created by the problems associated with the Year 2000 issue. In addition, the overnight reverse repo rate was maintained at 13.48 per cent by the Central Bank after 15 December 1999 to add further stability to call market rates.

Despite the slight upward movement in the first week of April 1999, with a peak of 32 per cent on 08 April 1999

inter-bank call market rates were generally stable. The presence of the Central Bank's repo and reverse repo facilities was primarily responsible for the stabilisation of the rates in the inter-bank call money market. Call money market rates, which were in a range of 13.00-14.00 per cent at the end of 1998, varied in a range of 11.13-17.00 per cent during the first two months of 1999. However, some volatility of rates was witnessed particularly in March and April, owing to a temporary shortage of liquidity in the market. Seasonal factors and other factors such as a 'go slow' in the banking sector and Provincial Council elections contributed to the call market rates moving within a wider range of 11.00-32.00 per cent during March and April 1999. In some instances, the non-availability, in the deficit banks, of the necessary collateral (i.e. Treasury bills and Treasury bonds) to have access to funds from the Central Bank's reverse repo window caused the call market rate to exceed

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

Box 9 Sri Lanka Inter Bank Offered Rates (SLIBOR)

Inter bank, offer rates are published in leading

international markets. The most welt known and widely

used are the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR),

European Interbank Offered Rates (EURIBOR) and

Singapore Interbank Offered Rates (SIBOR). These

rates are computed for different maturities and reflect

the funding costs of leading banks; Although all these

are offered rates, they are effectively used for many

transactions, including determining the yield rates for

many innovative financial instruments, and helped the

development of financial markets. LIBOR values are

computed fqrseveral: different maturities, e.g., .1-month,

3-months, 6rmonths and 12-months, for the. US dollar

and the sterling pound. The values, computed each

working day, are based on the offer rates made by 15

.banks, operating in London, to their best commercial

bank customers (i.e. prime banks). The LIBOR for any

single maturity is the simple average of the middle

nine offer rates of the rates quoted by those 15" banks.

EURIBOR was introduced by the European Banking

Federation to provide a benchmark rate for the euro.

A representative panel of 57 prime banks provide daily

quotes. EURIBOR is also computed as the simple

average of the balance middle rates after eliminating

the highest and the lowest 15 per cent of.the rates

quoted by these banks. EURIBOR rates too are quoted

for several maturities. SIBOR is computed as the

simple average of the rates quoted by seven banks in

Singapore for different maturities of US dollar

transactions.!

The reason for eliminating some of the highest and the lowest rates is to avoid distortions that could be caused by extreme values. Further, by taking a simple average (rather than a weighted average), the dominance of the rate by the extra large banks is avoided. All these rates are offered rates rather than realised rates, and are published by 11.00 a.m.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka commenced* publishing the Sri Lanka Inter Bank Offered Rates (SLIBOR) with effect from 7 June 1999. Three rates, i.e., overnight, 7-days and 1-month, are currently published. These rates are based on the rates offered for rupee transactions among commercial banks in Sri Lanka.

Prior to the introduction of SLIBOR, there were no daily published average offered rates for rupee transactions in Sri Lanka. The best available indicator for, offer rates on a daily basis was the interest rate

in the inter-bank call market, which is a rate for realised transactions. This, however, varies during the day and is not published formally by any organisation in the form of a single rate relating to a given day. Therefore, suggestions were made by»many interested parties that the Central Bank should compile and publish daily rupee interest rates to fill this lacuna. These rates are expected to reflect the most current lending rates among banks and therefore be good indicators of market liquidity. Over time, they would also serve as benchmark rates for many other transactions, as in other financial markets.

Although there are several average interest rates published in Sri Lanka such as the Central Bank's repurchase and reverse repurchase rates, the Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR) and the Treasury bill and bond rates, the SLIBOR values have several distinctive features. All the {other rates are realised rates generated after the event and hence reflect historical data. The SLIBOR however are forward looking. They also reflect the most current information available relating to liquidity in the inter­bank market. Further, as they relate to inter-bank transactions, the distortion caused by^an in built risk premium would be minimal. Thus, except for risk free rates on gilt instruments, they would be the most appropriate benchmark rates for other market transactions.

In computing SLIBOR, the methodologies adopted in the computation of the EURIBOR, LIBOR and SIBOR have been broadly followed. The computation of the SLIBOR values is presently based on the offers made by 12 commercial banks which play a leading role in the interbank market in Sri Lanka. These comprise the two state banks, four large domestic private banks and six foreign banks. These 12 banks have been requested to provide their rates for three maturities; 1-day (overnight), 7-days and 1-month, between 8.30 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. on each working day. s A simple; average SLIBOR is computed for each of the three maturities. The three highest and the three lowest values are excluded in the computation of the SLIBOR to provide a more central indicator of the daily interest rates at which commercial banks in Sri Lanka would offer funds to other commercial banks. The rates are for transactions in Sri Lanka rupees and not foreign currency. The.:.SLIBOR values are

published daily by the Centrals Bank between 10.30 a.m. and 11.00 a.m. through the Central Bank's Website and Reuters News Agency.

Box 9 (contd.)

The behaviour of SLIBOR rates in 1999 are shown in Chart I. The overnight SLIBOR moved within a range of 9.82-14.50 per cent, while the SLIBOR values for 7-days and 1-month maturities moved within a range of 10.67-14.48 per cent and 12.25-14.50 per cent, respectively. The overnight SLIBOR values are very closely related to the realised weighted average rate for the daily transactions in the call market which moved in a range of 9.60-15.00 per cent in this period (Chart II). The correlation coefficient between the overnight SLIBOR rate and the realised Weighted Average Call Market Rate in this period was 0.97. Meanwhile, the movements of 7-day SLIBOR values appears to have a similar pattern to the Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR),

which is an interest rate computed weekly on the basis of the rates offered by commercial banks to their prime customers (Chart III). The AWPR is usually higher than the 7-days SLIBOR, as could be expected given the risk premium that banks would charge even their best non-bank customers. The correlation coefficient between the 7-day SLIBOR values (averaged for a week for comparability) and the AWPR was 0.95.

Currently, SLIBOR values are computed only for overnight, 7-days and 1-month maturities. Market sources indicate that SLIBOR values have been useful as indicators of market interest rates. The Central Bank expects to compute SLIBOR values for longer maturities in the future.

the Bank's overnight reverse repo rate. However, the volatility subsidised towards the end of April and the maximum rate remained below 15.00 per cent during the rest of 1999. The rates varied within a range of 9.75 -14.25 per cent in December 1999 and within a range of 12.75 - 13.75 per cent at end December 1999.

Because of the availability of bills in the Central Bank's portfolio, there was no necessity to issue Central Bank securities for open market operations during 1999. However, these were available at rates linked to the 3-month Treasury bill rates.

Sri Lanka Inter Bank Offer Rates (SLIBOR), based on the rates offered for rupee transactions by 12 commercial banks, were published on a daily basis with effect from 07 June 1999 (see Box 9 for details). The overnight SLIBOR values varied within a range of 9.77-14.29 per cent, the 7-day rate in a range of 10.67-14.48 per cent and the 1-month rate in a rage of 12.25-14.50 per cent during the year.

Deposit Rates

In view of the steady decline in inflation rates and also the reduction in the SRR, which reduced the effective cost of funds of banks, commercial banks brought down their deposit rates marginally in 1999. However, these reductions were less than the fall in inflation, resulting in an increase in real deposit rates in 1999. Although the savings deposit rates in the j commercial banks remained unchanged, at the level recorded at end December 1998, the maximum rate on 3-month deposits was brought down from 13.00 per cent to 11.50 per cent, while the maximum rate on 12-month deposits was reduced from 13.00 per cent to 12.50 per cent. The Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR), which is based on all interest bearing deposits of commercial banks, declined gradually from 9.20 per cent at end December

1998 to 9.08 per cent at end December 1999. However, the Average Weighted Fixed Deposit Rate (AWFDR) stood at 10.72 per cent at end 1999, the same level as at end 1998, with slight changes during the year.

Interest rates on foreign currency savings deposits, which are based on international developments, moved upwards during the year, following changes in international rates. Savings deposit rates denominated in US dollars were in the range: of 2.25-6.00 per cent in 1999 as against 2.50-5.50 per cent in 1998. Sterling deposits, which generally carry a higher deposit rate, varied within a range of 2.25-6.25 per cent. US dollar 1-year fixed deposit rates varied within a range of 4.00-6.25 per cent in the first half of 1999, and moved to a range of 4.25-6.13 per cent in the rest of 1999. In contrast, 1-year fixed deposits denominated in Sterling which were at 4.00-6.75 per cent in January

1999 fell to a range of 3.50-6.50 per cent in December 1999. Meanwhile, the rates offered by FCBUs on US dollar deposits were in a range of 4.75-6.00 per cent and on deposits in. Sterling in a range of 5.00-6.50 per cent throughout the year.

Following market trends, the National Savings Bank

(NSB) also revised its savings deposit rates from 10.50 per

cent in December 1998 to 9.60 per cent in January 1999.

This rate was further brought down to 9.20 per cent in July

1999 and was maintained at that level during the rest of

1999. However, rates on 12-month fixed deposit rates

remained unchanged at 11.50 per cent, with a view to

attracting more fixed deposits to the NSB.

Lending Rates

In line with the declining trend in short-term rates, a slight

decline in general commercial bank lending rates was

observed in 1999. The reduction of the SRR was partly

responsible for pushing down lending rates of commercial

banks by about 0.5-1.0 percentage points. The Average

Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR), which indicates the

average lending rate applicable to the prime customers of

commercial banks, which was 14.90 per cent at end

December 1998, varied between 13.10 per cent and 17.10

per cent during the year and ended 1999 at 15.90 per cent.

The Average Weighted Lending Rate (AWLR) based on the

Quarterly Survey of Commercial Bank Loans and Advances

declined from 19.60 per cent at end September 1998 to

19.10 per cent at end June 1999 and further to 18.90 per

cent at end September 1999.

FCBU's lending rates to domestic customers did not

show a significant change during the year. Lending rates

in US dollars varied in a range of 4.00-9.00 per cent while

interest rates charged for non-BOI exporters were in the

range of 6.01-10.50 per cent in 1999 compared to the range

of 6.18-10.50 per cent in the previous year.

Rates on commercial paper, which are unsecured promissory notes issued by the corporate sector and financial institutions to raise short-term funds, also showed some decline and were in the range of 11.50-16.25 per cent during the year in comparison to the range of 11.00-18.00 per cent in 1998. In addition, interest rates charged on outstanding balances on credit cards were in the range of 24.00-32.40 per cent.

Under the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No.

6 of 1990 and in terms of Section 23 of the Debt Recovery

(Special Provisions) Act No.2 of 1990 the Central Bank

publishes the legal rate of interest and the market rate of

interest annually. Both rates for the year 1999 were 9.70

per cent, down from the 11.50 per cent in 1998.

Long-Term Rates

Long-term rates include interest rates on Rupee securities (Rupee loans) of the government, yield rates on Treasury bonds, lending rates of long-term credit institutions and debentures. The interest rates on Rupee loans, which are issued for the periods of 2 years, 7-8 years and 9-10 years were 12.00 per cent, 12.25 per cent and 12.50 per cent,

1 7 9

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

respectively. These rates were in a range of 11.00-12.25 per

cent in the previous year. These rates do not reflect market

trends as they are administratively determined.

The Central Bank increased the maturity of Treasury

bonds issued to the market by issuing 5-year and 6-year

bonds in 1999. Treasury bonds, which were first issued in

1997, hitherto had maturities of 2, 3i and 4 years. This

move further assists building up a longer-term yield curve

in the financial market by providing risk free medium-term

benchmark rates. The coupon rates for the respective

maturities were in the range of 11.00 - 12.25 per cent, with

the longer maturities carrying higher rates. The bonds are

sold by auction. The weighted average yield rate on 2-year

bonds was in the range of 12.64-13.42 per cent, while the

yield on 3-year bonds, varied in the range of 12.79-13.95

per cent. Meanwhile, yield rates on 4-year and 5-year bonds

were in the ranges of 13.21-14.02 per cent and 13.30-13.97

per cent, respectively. The yield rate on 6-yeaf Treasury

bonds was 13.65 per cent, at the single auction held for that

particular maturity in 1999.' The relatively flat yield curve

appears to indicate that the market's expectations of rising

inflation are gradually receding.

Interest rates charged by long-term lending institutions

including Licensed .Specialised Banks, other than the State

Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB), the National

Housing Development Authority (NHDA) and the National

Savings Bank (NSB), declined slightly during the year.

These rates were reduced particularly in the second half of

1999, Rates charged by the SMIB, the NHDA and the NSB

remained unchanged in the ranges of 15.00-18.00 per cent,

10.00-16.00 per cent and 14.00-15.00 per cent, respectively,

as in the previous.year. Long-term lending rates of DFCC

Bank were reduced from 13.00-20.50 per cent in December

1998 to 10.00-19.00 per cent in December 1999. The

minimum lending rates .charged by National Development

Bank (NDB). were brought down from 9.60 per cent to 6.30

per cent in 1999.

Two private; domestic commercial banks, one licensed specialised bank and three other financial institutions issued debentures during the year. A 5-year guaranteed redeemable debenture by, Mercantile Leasing Ltd. in February 1999 was the: first debenture issue by way of a rights issue by an institution. This debenture carried an effective annual interest rate, of 14.49 per cent. People's Merchant Bank issued a 5-year guaranteed redeemable debenture in April listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange at an effective annual interest rate'of 14,20 per cent. Vanik Incorporation Limited issued 3-year unlisted unsecured redeemable debentures with an effective annual interest rate of 17.55 per. cent in May.- Sampath Bank Ltd. issued 5-year unsecured subordinated redeemable debentures in July, with three interest rate options; 13.50 per cent per annum payable quarterly (effective rate of 14.20 per cent per

annum), 14.20 per cent per annum payable annually or a

floating rate of 1 per cent over the simple average of the

three month Weighted Average Treasury bill rate at the

previous four primary auctions (subject to a minimum of

12.00 per cent and a maximum of 16.00 per cent per

annum), payable quarterly. In September NDB issued 5-year

quoted unsecured subordinated redeemable floating rate

debentures, carrying a floating interest rate of one per cent

over the simple average of the one year Weighted Average

Treasury bill yield at the previous four primary auctions,

subject to a floor of 12.50 per cent per annum and a cap

of 16.00 per cent per annum, payable annually. In

November Seylan Bank Ltd. issued 5-year unsecured

subordinated redeemable debentures with two interest rate

options, either 13.35 per cent per annum payable monthly

or 14.20 per cent per annum payable annually.

10.4 Commercial Banking

The total assets/liabilities of the domestic units of

commercial banks registered a moderate growth in 1999,

while those of FCBUs declined. The slowing down in

external trade, uncertainties related to elections and a

cautious approach taken by banks on Y2K related issues

were responsible for the relatively slow growth in domestic

banking units. The lower demand for credit in foreign

currency, in view of the reduction in international trade,

lower domestic interest rates and uncertainties in the

international markets, tended to reduce the operations of the

FCBUs. The total assets of the domestic units grew by 13.8

per cent as compared to 13 per cent in the previous year.

However, the total assets of the FCBUs declined by 9.3 per

cent in comparison to a decline of 9 per cent in 1998.

A rise in foreign balances and domestic credit supported the increase in the assets of the domestic units. Significant increases were seen in credit extended to government corporations and to the government. Rising international prices of fuel, increased activity and higher levels of investment caused government corporations to increase their borrowing levels. This is in contrast to 1998, when increased profits enabled government corporations to reduce their liabilities to banks. Net credit to the government from commercial banks increased in 1999. Increased government expenditure, partly in respect of capital projects, and reduced inflows of foreign funds led to the government having greater recourse to the domestic banking system to obtain funds. In terms of total value, the largest growth in assets was increased provision of credit to the private sector.

The increase in liabilities, corresponding to the increase in assets, came about mainly through an increase in deposits, in other liabilities and in borrowings. Commercial banks maintained their growth in deposits at a level similar to the growth in advances, resulting in a relatively stable

180

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

credit to deposit ratio. Within deposits, time and savings

deposits increased at a faster rate compared to demand

deposits. Reflecting the reduced attractiveness of obtaining

credit in foreign currency, credit granted by FCBUs to the

private sector declined. Similarly, foreign currency loans

extended by commercial banks to non-BOI exporters

declined in comparison to 1998. Meanwhile the government

repaid a portion of the syndicated loan of US dollars 100

million obtained from the FCBUs in 1998.

The net foreign asset position of the domestic banking

units, as well as the FCBUs, improved during the year.

Caution on the part of banks in increasing their foreign

currency exposure to the domestic sector and reduced

demand for foreign currency credit mentioned above led to

foreign assets of commercial banks recording a larger

increase than foreign liabilities, resulting in an improvement

in the net foreign asset position.

With the reduction in the Statutory Reserve

Requirement (SRR) and in inflation, both deposit rates and

lending rates of commercial banks declined marginally.

However, the net interest income rose by 2 per cent in

1999. Fee based activities are becoming an increasingly

more important source of income for banks, and in 1999,

accounted for 17 per cent of the total income. Foreign

banks have a higher proportion of their income from fee

based activities than domestic banks.

Structure of Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks

Total resources of domestic units of commercial banks

increased by Rs. 69,173 million (13.8 per cent) in 1999,

in comparison to the Rs. 58,892 million (13.3 per cent) in

1998. Increases in private sector credit, credit to the

government, credit to public corporations and foreign assets

were primarily responsible for growth in commercial bank

assets. Total loans and advances, including commercial bills,

expanded by 15.6 per cent and contributed 59 per cent to

the total growth of commercial bank assets. However, there

was a substantial slowing down in the growth in

commercial bills, including local bills, import bills and

export bills, a result of the decline in international trade in

1999. The increase in foreign assets of the commercial

banks contributed 25 per cent of the growth in total assets,

in comparison to 18 per cent recorded in 1998.

Within the liquid assets category, there was a

significant increase in cash holdings of banks due primarily

to banks holding additional cash as a precautionary measure

in view of the uncertainties relating to the Year 2000

problem. Cash on hand grew by 41 per cent in 1999 as

against 12 per cent in the previous year. However, the

decline in deposits with the Central Bank and in

commercial bills more than offset the increase in cash on

hand. The ratio of total liquid assets to total assets

decreased from 33 per cent in 1998 to 28 per cent in 1999.

Within the liabilities category, deposit liabilities, which

grew by 14.8 per cent, contributed to 73 per cent of the

increase in total liabilities in 1999. This increase was 12.3

per cent in 1998. Indicating public preference to hold

interest bearing assets, time and savings deposits grew by

15.4 per cent as compared to the growth in demand deposits

of 12.1 per cent. Meanwhile, reflecting improved liquidity

in the banking system, and increased activity among banks,

interbank borrowing grew by 15.6 per cent in 1999 in

comparison to 17.6 per cent in 1998. In line with the slight

reduction in most other market interest rates, the weighted

average interest rate in the inter-bank market declined by

0.5 percentage points to 12.5 per cent in 1999 from 13.0

per cent in 1998.

Balances in the capital account grew marginally by 2.7

per cent (Rs. 1,351 million) in 1999, compared to the 13.2

per cent (Rs. 5,851 million) increase in 1998. However, two

domestic banks issued debentures to strengthen the overall

capital adequacy and to match the long-term asset base. The

banks were made aware that, in order to strengthen the

soundness of the banking system, the Capital Adequacy

Ratio (CAR) applicable on Tier II capital would be raised

from 8 per cent to 10 per cent, while the CAR on Tier I

capital would be raised from 4 per cent 5 per cent, in 2001.

Commercial banks improved their net foreign assets

position in 1999 as they sought to reduce their foreign

currency exposure and foreign currency borrowing became

less attractive to domestic customers. A growth was seen

in both foreign assets and liabilities. However, the growth

in assets was faster, leading to a net improvement. Foreign

assets of domestic units grew by 29.3 per cent in 1999

(21.5 per cent in 1998). Within these assets, deposits with

banks abroad rose by 28.8 per cent (25 per cent during

1998), while placements with FCBUs increased by 38.2 per

cent. However, other foreign assets, mainly export bills,

declined. Over 90 per cent of the foreign liabilities of

domestic banking units arise from foreign currency deposits

in the non resident foreign currency (NRFC) and resident

non national foreign currency (RNNFC) accounts, resident

foreign currency (RFC) accounts and foreign currency

deposits of exporters. These increased by 34 per cent in

1999. Domestic units continued to place the bulk of their

foreign currency deposits with the FCBUs.

Twenty five FCBUs continued to operate in 1999.

However, operations of the FCBUs further contracted during

the year with total assets/liabilities decreasing by US dollars

143 million (9 per cent). The major sources of resources

for FCBUs continued to be investment by DBUs of their

foreign currency deposits and deposits by BOI enterprises.

Investments with non-resident enterprises and loans and

advances to BOI enterprises were the main areas where

FCBU funds were deployed. With the decline in domestic

interest rates and some contraction in the growth of exports,

credit extended by FCBUs to BOI enterprises declined from

US dollars 728 million in 1998 to US dollars 680 million

1999. FCBUs granted a syndicated loan of US dollars 100

million to the government in November 1998, of which US

dollars 18 million was repaid in 1999. The FCBUs too

improved in their net foreign asset position to record a net

surplus of US dollars 133 million at end 1999. As in the

case of domestic units, a decline in liabilities compared to

assets of non-residents led to the net improvement.

The decline in the total gross assets of FCBUs was

seen in claims of non-residents and resident categories.

During the year, placement with banks abroad declined by

8 per cent, while claims on non-banks increased by 10 per

cent. Total lending to the private sector by FCBUs

amounted to US dollars 697 million at the end of 1999,

an 6 per cent decline in comparison to the previous year.

Of the total FCBU credit to the private sector, two thirds

were provided by FCBUs of domestic banks.

Within the assets, the major share of loans have been

granted to BOI enterprises. However, reflecting the slower

growth of Sri Lankan exports, the credit granted to BOI

enterprises declined by 6 per cent in 1999. Credit to other

approved residents also decreased.

Also reflecting the reduced attractiveness of obtaining

credit in foreign currency, the credit extended under the

special facility to non-BOI exporters ^was lower in 1999

than in 1998. A sum of US dollars 124 million was granted

in 1999, as against a sum of US dollars 177 million in

1998. Of this credit, only US dollars 25 million has been

granted through FCBUs.

1 8 2

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

On the liabilities side of the FCBUs, the decline was

a combined outcome of a decline in non-resident liabilities

(US dollars 132 million) and resident liabilities (US dollars

32 million) and an increase in internal accounts (US dollars

21 million). The major portion of resident liabilities was

through placements of funds by domestic units.

Sources and Users of Funds of Domestic Units of Commercial Banks

With the higher rate of growth in assets and liabilities seen

in 1999 in comparison to 1998, a corresponding increase

in available resources was also recorded. The total net

availability of resources to the commercial banks grew by

10.2 per cent to Rs. 17,451 million in 1999. On a net basis,

private sector and other assets and other liabilities were the

major sources of funds, while the government and

government corporations were the major users of funds.

Taken together, the domestic private sector and other assets

and other liabilities category contributed 90 per cent of the

net increase in funds. The government sector was the sector

which absorbed the largest proportion of the funds (84 per

cent - government 37 per cent and government corporations

47 per cent).

In contrast to the previous year, the use of funds as

reserves with the Central bank declined with the decline in

the reserve requirement. The CBSL, which absorbed 20 per

cent of funds during 1998, absorbed only a negligible

portion (under one per cent) of the increase in resources

in 1999. In contrast to 1998, the foreign sector became a

net user of funds as the domestic units of commercial banks

built up their net foreign asset position.

Continuing the trend observed in previous years, the

other assets and liabilities category was a net provider of

funds. Increases in capital and reserves of commercial banks

enhanced resource availability. In addition, other liabilities

too were a source of funds, partly due to inflows from

the debentures issued by the banks. The domestic private

sector continued to be a source of funds as in 1998. This

sector provided a net sum of Rs.8,506 million in 1999,

compared to the Rs. 1,229 million in 1998.

Government and government corporations were major

users of funds, as seen in the growth in credit to these

sectors. Government corporations absorbed 47 per cent of

the total increase in commercial bank resources in 1999.

Corporations were net users through both an increase in

credit obtained and a reduction in their deposits with

banks.

banks recorded a 12.4 per cent growth from end September

1998 to end September 1999, in comparison to a 12.1 per

cent growth in the 12 months"ending September 1998 and

a 10.5 per cent growth'during the first half of 1999. The

pick up in economic activity which is evident from the

higher growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.0

per cent in the third quarter of 1999, compared to a 3 per

cent growth in the first half of 1999 is reflected in the

increase in credit.

The commercial sector, which accounted for the largest

portion (41 per cent) of credit outstanding, experienced a

relatively slow growth in credit (8 per cent from end

September 1998 to end September 1999) due to the slowing

down of exports and imports. However, in the second

quarter and in the third quarter, reflecting some

improvement, credit extended for the export of processed

coconut products and handicrafts grew by 58 per cent, 55

per cent, respectively while credit for gem and garment

exports grew each by. 11 per cent. Similarly, with the

increase in some categories of imports e.g., motor vehicles,

machinery and equipment, building materials, consumer

durables arid intermediate goods such as raw-materials,

credit to these sectors rose. The reduction in the

international prices of petroleum products in 1998 resulted

in a smaller import bill and a greater profitability of the

Petroleum Corporation, enabling it to reduce its

commitments to batiks. Consequently, a considerable decline

was observed in credit provided for the import of petroleum

products until end second quarter 1999. However, the

subsequent sharp increase in international prices of

petroleum products is reflected in growth in credit provided

for importing petroleum products in the third quarter 1999.

Commercial banks' credit to the housing sector has increased and several banks raised long-term funds for this purpose. The housing and property development category, the second largest absorber of total credit, accounting for 13 per cent of total credit outstanding, recorded a growth rate of 8 per cent on a point to point basis from end September 1998 to end September 1999. A substantial portion (81 per cent) of the credit granted for housing and property development purposes was accounted for by personal housing.

At end September 1999, of the total credit given by commercial banks, about 11 per cent was absorbed by the consumption category. In that category, a large portion (93 per cent) of credit was absorbed by individuals for their personal needs. Meanwhile, a significant growth was observed (31 per cent point to point growth) in credit provided through credit cards, reflecting the increased use

1 The description in this,section depends on the information obtained through the Quarterly Survey of Bank Advances and Deposits and is based on domestic banking unit data upto end September 1999.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

of credit cards in response to aggressive marketing campaigns conducted by some commercial banks. The industrial sector too accounted for a share of 11 per cent in total credit outstanding. Although credit provided to the overall industrial sector showed a comparatively slow growth, credit provided for the engineering and building trade had grown significantly by end September 1999 in comparison to a decline recorded from end September 1997 to end September 1998. Credit to other manufacturing industries recorded a growth of 5 per cent at end September

1999. Among these industries, the sectors which recorded notable increases in utilisation of credit were food and beverages, leather industries, chemicals and petroleum.

In terms of sectoral distribution of credit, the highest growth in credit was recorded by the financial sector (44 per cent) and the services sector (35 per cent), although each of these sectors absorbed only around 5 per cent of total credit outstanding. Around 85 per cent of the total credit to the financial sector was absorbed by financial institutions and leasing companies. The growth in credit to the services sector was clearly reflected in the GDP, where the growth in value added in services grew from 2.4 per cent in the first half of 1999 to 4.1 per cent in the third quarter. In that sector, a large portion of credit was absorbed by passenger transport and commercial transport sub sectors.

The agriculture sector and the 'other' sector each absorbed around 6 per cent of total credit outstanding. Out of the total credit provided to the agricultural sector, the highest portion of credit was absorbed by the tea sector. Some recovery was seen in credit provided to the tourism sector, which grew by 9 per cent from end September 1998 to end September 1999. The continued increase in tourist arrivals has stimulated activities in this sector as seen from the increase in credit obtained for the construction of tourist hotels.

In terms of the maturity pattern, a large portion of loans and advances by the commercial banks continued to be in the form of short-term credit. At the end of September 1999, short-term credit (less than one year) accounted for 64 per cent in total credit while the shares of medium-term (2-5 years) and long-term (over 5 years) credit were 22.8 per cent and 13.3 per cent, respectively. This pattern generally holds for all sectors, except housing and property development and tourism. In the case of credit for housing purposes, 41 per cent was long-term and 36 per cent medium-term. For tourism, 38 per cent was in the form of long-term credit.

It is observed from the classification of loans and advances by security, that the proportion of credit given against different types of security is relatively stable. Approximately 26 per cent of credit was given against immovable property, plant and machinery. Personal guarantees and promissory note, other securities and

unsecured credit accounted 16 per cent, 17 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. The share of advances given against fixed, savings and other deposits was around 10 per cent at end September 1999, while the relative importance of credit extended against shares of joint stocks companies, bonds and debentures declined from 2 per cent at end September 1998 to 1 per cent at end September 1999. This can be attributed to depressed stock market prices and the consequent low value of shares that are used as collateral. Similarly, credit given against trust receipts also declined

from 5 per cent to 3 per cent during the same period. Stock

in trade (7 per cent) was the other important form of

security.

Keeping with the declining trend in other market interest rates, the Weighted Average Lending Rate, dropped from 19.6 per cent at end September 1998 to 19.1 per cent at end June 1999, and further to 18.9 per cent by end September 1999. The amount of credit granted at higher rates of interest continued to decline. The percentage share of total credit provided at interest rates above 25 per cent

dropped by 6 per cent from the level at end September

1998, while the percentage share of credit outstanding

granted at interest rates ranging between 21-25 per cent

declined by 1 per cent. The proportion of total outstanding

loans and advances provided at interest rates ranging

between 16-20 per cent increased from 14 per cent at end

September 1998 to 21 per cent at end September 1999.

10.5 Central Banking

The Central Bank's operations continued to focus on

maintaining stability in financial markets. As a part of the

ongoing process to move towards more market oriented

operations, the statutory reserve requirement was reduced.

The Bank Rate was also reduced. In monetary policy

operations, the Bank continued to use the repurchase facility

and the reverse repurchase facility extensively. In the

foreign exchange market, the Bank continued to quote daily

buying and selling rates for the US dollar, the intervention

currency, for transactions with commercial banks. These

rates were determined primarily by market developments.

The Bank does not enter into forward foreign exchange

transactions. The Central Bank introdued several measures

in the latter part of the year to ensure that issues related

to the year 2000 problem would not destabilise the market,

these measures and the close links maintained wih the

commercial banks ensured that the year 2000 issue was

dealt with no untoward incidents.

Structure of Assets and Liabilities

The total resources of the Central Bank increased by 6.3

per cent (Rs.11,913 million) to Rs.200,586 million during

the period compared to a 2.6 per cent (Rs.4,774 million)

growth in 1998.

When the assets side is taken into consideration, the

increase was entirely due to the rise in domestic assets of

the Central Bank. The total international reserve of the

Central Bank declined by Rs. 18,954 million (14.9 per cent)

reflecting the deficit in the BOP in 1999. This is in contrast

to the increase in foreign assets by 15 per cent (Rs. 15,755

million) in 1998.

Meanwhile, domestic assets of the Central Bank increased significantly by Rs30,886 million (50.2 per cent) in comparison to the Rs.3,401 million (5 per cent) decrease in 1998. Loans and advances to government through the revolving credit facility increased by Rs.2,777 million (13.3 per cent). In order to offset the impact of shortage of liquidity resulting from the outflow in the balance of payments and the need to ensure adequate liquidity in the market to facilitate economic activity, the Central Bank provided liquidity through its operations in the primary and secondary markets for government securities. Consequent on this and the desire on the part of commercial banks to hold higher cash balances at the end of the year, largely due to Y2K related issues, the Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank increased significantly by Rs.16,933 million in 1999.

1 8 6

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

In comparison, the increase in Treasury bill holdings in

1998 amounted to Rs. 1,885 million.

On the liabilities side, the deposits with the Central

Bank declined by 3 per cent (Rs.2,061 million), in

comparison to the decline of 5 per cent (Rs3,701 million)

in 1998. This was due to a decline in both government

deposits and commercial bank deposits with the Central

Bank. The deposits of commercial banks declined by 8 per

cent when compared with 1998, as a result of the reduction

of the statutory reserve ratio by one percentage point.

However, the deposits of international institutions,

international banks etc. increased by 3 per cent (Rs. 1,229

million).

The total currency issue of the Bank during the year

in 1999 increased by 16.8 per cent (Rs.10,123 million)

compared to a 13.2 per cent increase recorded in 1998. This

was partly due to the usual growth in the demand for

currency for economic activity and partly due to the desire

of commercial banks to hold higher cash balances for

precautionary purposes due to Y2K related problems at the

end of 1999. The issue of currency notes increased by 17.5

per cent in 1999 compared to the 13.8 per cent recorded

in the previous year, while the issue of coins increased by

10.8 per cent in 1999 in comparison to 12.3 per

centincrease in 1998. The efforts taken by the Central Bank

and commercial banks to reassure the public with regard

to the possibility of problems arising as a consequence of

the Y2K issue were successful, and the increase in currency

held by the public in this regard was much less than

originally anticipated.

10.6 Banking Development

The total number of commercial banks in operation at end

1999 was 25, comprising 9 domestic banks and 16 foreign bank branches (excluding the Colombo branch of Societe Generale, which ceased operations with effect from 31.12.1999). In comparison, at the end of 1998, there were 8 domestic banks and 18 foreign bank branches. During

1999, the Colombo branch of Korea Exchange Bank ceased its operations while a Canadian bank, viz., Nova Scotia Bank, established a branch in Colombo during the year. The business of the Colombo branch of the Overseas Trust Bank was transferred to the Nations Trust Bank, a domestic private bank which commenced operations in mid 1999.

Another significant development that took place in the banking sector during the period was the completion of the restructuring programme of Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) by setting up Regional Development Banks (RDBs), which commenced in 1998. All RRDBs operating in the country have now been absorbed into RDBs under the provisions of the Regional Development Bank Act No.6 of 1997. The Wayamba Development Bank, the Sabaragamuwa Development Bank and the Uva

Development Bank were established during the period,

bringing the total number of RDBs in operation to 6. The

banks have been issued licences as Specialised Banks under

the Banking Act. This resulted in increasing the total

number of licensed specialised banks to twelve.

Branch Network

The total branch network of commercial banks including main branches, Agrarian Service Centre (ASC) branches, kachcheri branches, extension offices and overseas branches (but excluding 185 pawning centres) increased from 1,038 at end 1998 to 1,054 at end 1999. Hatton National Bank Ltd. and Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. opened 6 branches each. Sampath Bank Ltd. opened 2 branches, while Pan Asia Bank Ltd. and Seylan Bank Ltd. opened a branch each. The total number of extension offices and pay offices increased from 65 per cent and 67 per cent at end

1999, while the number of ASC branches and kachcheri branches of Bank of Ceylon remained unchanged. These changes, together with setting up of Nations Trust Bank, resulted in increasing the total number of branches of domestic banks by 19 to 1,012 at end period. In addition, Hatton National Bank Ltd. set up 27 Student Saving Units in schools during the year. The total number of foreign bank branches decreased from 45 to 42 at end 1999. This resulted from the closure of the branch of Korea Exchange

187

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

Bank, the branch of Societe enerale and two extension

offices of Mashreq Bank and Indian Bank, the opening of

a branch of Nova Scotia Bank and the take over of the

branch of the Overseas Trust Bank by Nations Trust Bank.

Meanwhile, Citibank opened a counter at the US embassy.

The total number of persons served by a commercial bank

branch (excluding pawning centres) decreased from 18,086

persons at end 1998 to 18,067 persons at end 1999. The

total number of RDB branches was 176 at end 1999. The

National Savings Bank opened two mini branches (Savings

Shops) during the year.

Banking Facilities

Commercial banks increased the provision of facilities

through the introduction of new products and the use of

rapid advances in technology. Banks expended considerable

efforts to ensure that they were Y2K compliant.

Standard Chartered Bank introduced the concept of

'Room Service'. Under this facility, when a prospective

customer wishes to open an account, an officer from the

bank visits the person and provides assistance in opening

the account. In addition, cheque books are also delivered

to customers under this scheme. The 'Royalty Banking'

concept was introduced by Hatton National Bank, under

which special banking facilities are provided for high

networth individuals. Pan Asia Bank introduced a new

service, named 'Speed Service (Door to Door) Spot Cash'

which offers same day delivery of foreign remittances

channelled through the bank.

People's Bank introduced a savings scheme, named 'Videsika', to encourage Sri Lankans employed abroad to save their foreign exchange earnings. Seylan Bank Ltd. launched three deposit schemes namely, a Three year fixed deposit scheme, the 'Tikiri Prasada' Children's Certificate Scheme and the 'Ranliya' Savings Scheme for women. Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. introduced a three year fixed deposit scheme, named 'Full Option Fixed Deposits'. Muslim Commercial Bank Ltd. commenced a new deposit scheme named 'Ranmuthu' Investment Savings Scheme, with maturities of 3, 6, 12 months. A new deposit scheme for children titled 'Pubudu Children's Savings Scheme' was introduced by Sampath Bank Ltd. Pan Asia Bank introduced a deposit scheme named 'Peramaga Students Progress Account' for students, while Standard Chartered Bank launched a 'Young Savers' Deposit Scheme' for minors.

<A housing loan scheme named 'Piyasa Suva Nivasa' for -medical professionals and a loan scheme for disabled persons named 'Senehevanthayo' were introduced by Seylan Bank. Hongkong Bank introduced a housing loan scheme during the year, while Commercial Bank of Ceylon also introduced a personal loan scheme. Nations Trust Bank introduced two term loan schemes, i.e., a personal loan

scheme for educational purposes, to purchase consumer

durables and for investment purposes, and a home loan

facility. Pan Asia Bank introduced a pawning scheme

named the 'Ransika' loan scheme. Bank of Ceylon and

People's Bank each introduced a credit scheme named

'Samurdhi Small Industries Development Programme' to

promote small industries through micro enterprises under

the Samurdhi Movement. The maximum loan granted under

this scheme is Rs.25,000 with an interest rate of 10 per cent

per annum. Bank of Ceylon has implemented concessionary

schemes for some defaulters of agricultural loans. Several

new loan schemes, namely, 'Sahan Eliya', a credit scheme

to purchase consumer durables, 'Randiriya', a pawn broking

scheme, and a cultivation loan scheme were introduced by

Sampath Bank in addition to launching refinance credit

schemes under the second perennial crops development

project, the ADB Tea Development Project and the

Environmental Friendly Solutions Fund.

Eleven commercial banks installed 44 new ATMs

during the year, thus raising the total number of commercial

Bank ATMs operating in the country to 311. Use of credit

cards in Sri Lanka shows a gradual increase since their

introduction in the early 1980s. Initially, cards were issued

only for local transactions. However, with the liberalisation

of the current account following acceptance of Article VIII

status of the IMF by Sri Lanka in 1994, banks began to

issue global access cards as well. Six domestic banks and

two foreign banks presently issue credit cards under well

known international trade names, such as VISA and Master

Card. Several cards, 'Classic', 'Global', 'Apsara' and

'Business' are issued by these banks.

The total number of credit cards issued by end 1999 was 122,911, an increase of 43 per cent over the previous year. Of these, 33,719 were local cards while 88,192 were global cards. The total outstanding amount of credit granted through

cards at end December 1999 was Rs.2,365 million, a 59 per

cent growth over the value at the end of 1998. Credit cards

are a convenient facility for customers and their use is a

normal development as financial markets mature. Yet they

have the potential to create a debt trap for some consumers,

as has been the experience in some countries. Thus, it becomes

necessary to monitor developments relating to credit obtained

through these cards. In this regard, the substantial reduction

in the proportion of credit in the overdue category is a healthy

development, though the slight increase in the past due

category warrants attention.

10.7 Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka

The Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka, which was established by Credit Information Bureau Act No. 18 of

1990, has been operative since May 1990. During this brief period, the year 1999 can be described as the most successful year in which the Bureau for rhe first time recorded an operational profit of Rs. 185,442 while the net profit for the year was 5,392 million. This is a 46 per cent increase compared to a profit of Rs. 3,683 million earned in the year 1998. The Bureau achieved this target without increasing its fees for credit reports since March 1996.

This increase in overall profit is attributed to the upsurge in the demand for credit reports from shareholding lending institutions. The Bureau issued 155,243 credit reports during 1999, a 23 per cent increase compared to 125,928 credit reports issued in 1998. This trend reflects the increasing patronage of the Bureau by its clientele.

The Bureau has been able to increase its coverage by collecting information for 138,930 borrowers which include

33.008 irregular advances of Rs. 100,000 and over and 42,712 regular advances of 500,000 and over as at 31.12.1999.

The Bureau endeavours to collect as much information as possible on borrowers and also to increase its membership with a view to providing up-to date and complete credit information to its members.

All Regional Development Banks have been enrolled as members of the Bureau in terms of Section 43(a) of the Regional Development Bank Act No.6 of 1997.

In terms of Section 29(g) of the Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka (Amendment) Act No.8 of 1995, two private Licensed Specialised Banks, four leasing Companies and a Merchant Bank have been enrolled as new members of the Bureau. The Bank of Nova Scotia became a member as a Licensed Commercial Bank. As a result, Bureau's membership has increased to 69 which comprise of the Monetary Board of Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 26 Commercial Banks, 25 registered Finance Companies, 6 Licensed Specialised Banks, 6 Regional Development Banks and 4 Leasing Companies and a Merchant Bank.

10.8 Rural Banking and Credit

Overall Trends and Developments

The conventional solution to the perennial problem of

fluctuating prices of agricultural produce from season to

season has been to introduce floor price schemes and

establish government marketing institutions. Both these

solutions have proved to be failures in the long run. Hence,

it was necessary to approach the problem of price

fluctuations through a market based mechanism that would

sustain itself in the long run. Accordingly, a system of

forward sale contracts was introduced in 1999 on a trial

basis (see Box 2 for details).

This forward market contract system was introduced to

the agricultural sector, while pursuing the rural credit policy

stance followed in recent years. The key features of this

policy stance were the following: encouraging the

establishment of a widespread rural banking network at

grassroots levels to make credit more accessible to rural

people, promoting the setting up of people-based

organisations to establish cost effective credit delivery

systems and providing credit plus services to the rural

populations so that they could effectively use credit funds

for income generating self-employment activities.

The formation of people based organisations as

conduits to provide micro-finance was continued during

1999. More Samurdhi Bank Societies were formed, while

the Isuru Development Societies were strengthened.

Farmers' organisations also continued to be formed under

the Agrarian Services Act. Action was also taken to set up

farmers' companies as people's companies under the

Companies Act to engage in agri-business activities.

The year under review also witnessed the establishment

of 3 new Regional Development Banks (RDBs), viz.,

Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Rajarata, bringing the total

of such banks to 6 by the end of 1999.

The existing agricultural credit scheme, i.e., the New

Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) and the self-

employment oriented micro-credit scheme (Surathura Phase

II) continued to be funded by lending banks with an interest

subsidy from government. The interest rates on loans

granted under NCRCS and Surathura Phase II remained

unchanged at 12 per cent per annum and 10 per cent per

annum, respectively. A special agricultural credit guarantee

fund was set up in the Central Bank with funds provided

by the government to extend credit guarantee cover upto

60 per cent in respect of loans in loss under NCRCS. Loans

granted under the ADB funded Second Perennial Crops

Development Project and the Tea Development Project,

which came into operation in the year under review, were

also made eligible for credit guarantees from the

Agricultural Credit Guarantee Fund.

Two major policy changes were made in the area of agricultural insurance and agricultural extension services during the year under review. The government repealed the Agriculture Insurance Law No.27 of 1973 and enacted new legislation - the Agriculture and Agrarian Services Act No.20 of 1999 (See Box 3 for details). Second, for the first time in the history of agrarian services in the country, steps were taken to rely on the private sector to provide extension services for the agricultural sector. This was to be achieved as a pilot scheme under the Second Perennial Crops Development Project funded by the ADB. The objective of the new policy measure was to provide a more effective extension service to farmers through a 'user payee' system, thereby developing a market based extension service in the country.

New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS)

During the year under review, the New Comprehensive

Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) continued to operate

throughout the country, providing short-term cultivation

loans for farmers for the cultivation of paddy and other

subsidiary food crops. The Participating Credit Institutions

(PCls) granted loans amounting to Rs.464 million in respect

of 23,271 farmers. Since the refinance scheme was

withdrawn in April 1994 and replaced by an interest

subsidy scheme, the PCIs have granted cultivation loans out

of their own funds at an interest rate of 12 per cent per

Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

annum with an interest subsidy of 10 percentage points per

annum made available by the government. The interest

subsidy was intended to cover the possible losses to PCIs

due to their having to lend at rates below cost of funds.

In view of the short production cycle, the maximum period

given to farmers for repayment of NCRCS loans was 270

days and PCIs could, therefore, claim an interest subsidy

only for that duration. During 1999, a sum of Rs.12 million

was paid by the government on this count.

The Farmers' Relief Scheme, which was introduced in

1994 by government to provide relief to farmers who had

failed to re-pay their cultivation loans, was continued in

1999. Under this scheme, eligible farmers could have their

outstanding loans written off by paying 25 per cent of the

amount in default including accumulated interest. The

balance 75 per cent was to be shared by the Central Bank

(37.5 per cent), lending banks (18.75 per cent) and the

government (18.75 per cent).

At end 1999, a cumulative total of 63,500 farmers had benefited under this Scheme. During the year under review, the PCIs were compensated with a sum of Rs.68 million by the government as its share, while a sum of Rs. 117 million was paid by the Central Bank under the provisions of its Credit Guarantee Scheme. The cumulative amount of compensation paid by both the government and the Central Bank upto end 1999 under the Relief Scheme amounted to Rs.342 million.

Crop Insurance Schemes

The Agricultural Insurance Law was repealed and the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board (AAIB) was established under Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Act (see Box 3). While continuing its former business, steps were taken by the new AAIB to design new insurance schemes for seed farms, model farms, seed stores, livestock, fisheries,^ floriculture and coconut. The insurance schemes designed by the AAIB on the request of the Perennial Crops Development Project for perennial crops, Department of Export Agriculture for export agriculture crops, Southern Development Authority for maize cultivation in the Southern region and the Tea Research Institute and Tea Small Holding Development Authority for smallholder tea plantation continued to be in operation during the year under review. Ceylinco Insurance Company Ltd. (CICL), which is the only private insurer operating in the agricultural sector, expanded its services to various sectors includingi life insurance for farmers during 1999 after the enactment of the new Act.

The extent of paddy land insured by the AAIB in 1999 amounted to 11,000 hectares when compared to 14,000 hectares in 1998. This reduction has mainly been due to the difficulties in providing coverage for paddy lands in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country and a fall in the volume of loans granted under the NCRCS. Out of the districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces, AAIB could cover only a limited land area in the districts of Jaffna, Ampara, Batticaloa and Vavuniya. Insurance coverage for paddy and subsidiary food crops in the other parts in these districts was not provided by the AAIB. Therefore, the insurance premia collected and indemnities paid under paddy stood at Rs.6.7 million and Rs.1.5 million, respectively, during the year. The area insured under other crops by the AAIB stood at 2,138 hectares. The premia collected in this field was Rs.1.3 million. The amount of indemnities paid for other crops was Rs.0.3 million. The CICL insured an extent of 2,672 hectares of paddy land and collected premia to a value of Rs.2.4 million. The payment of indemnity for paddy farmers stood at Rs.0.4 million. In

respect of other crops, CICL has insured an area of 3,099 hectares and collected premia of Rs.2.1 million. The indemnity paid by CICL against such crops was Rs.0.9 million.

Both the AAIB and CICL have provided increased coverage for livestock during the year under review. The total premia collected by AAIB in the sector was Rs.3.7 million as against the coverage provided for 10,296 animals, whereas the indemnities paid amounted to Rs.1.1 million. The CICL also extended its coverage in the livestock sector by giving coverage for 1,829 animals. The premia collected stood at Rs.0.6 million, while the indemnities paid were Rs.0.3 million.

Micro-finance and Savings Schemes

Samurdhi Development Credit Schemes

The Samurdhi Bank Societies (SBSs), which were set up as an integral part of the Samurdhi Movement, continued to focus on mobilising savings from and granting loans to Samurdhi members during the year under review. At end

1999, 840 SBSs had been established throughout the country. The paid up capital of the shareholders, numbering 1,198,167, amounted to Rs.548 million at end 1999. The value of other deposits made by the members amounted to Rs.656 million. The SBS had granted 182,695 loans to a value of Rs.805 million to members to start small-scale businesses in agriculture, agro-processing, petty trading, fisheries and meet consumption requirements. So far, there have been no reports of defaults of Samurdhi loans by borrowers.

In addition to the loans granted to Samurdhi members, other Samurdhi credit programs, viz., Samurdhi Development Credit Programme (SASANA), Samurdhi Animators Credit Programme, Refinance Credit Programme (PANA) and leasing programmes were also in operation during the year under review. The value of loans granted under all types of schemes including loans granted by SBSs stood at Rs.1,792 million in respect of 387,596 loans, at "end 1999.

Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies (TCCS) Credit Scheme

Mobilisation of savings from and granting of loans to the

TCCS members were continued by both the Sanasa

Development Bank (SDB) and the TCCS during the year

under review. The SDB, which was established in 1997,

provided loans to TCCS members and other customers

under several loan schemes designed by the SDB. The total

savings of the SDB at end 1999 stood at Rs.966 million.

It had also granted loans to a value of Rs.324 million

during 1999.

Janashakthi Banking Societies at Hambantota

Janashakthi Banking Societies (JBSs) were first set up in 1989 as informal savings and loan associations by the Women's Development Federation (WDF), a non­governmental organisation operating in the Hambantota District, with a vision to empower women in poor families in the area to become both socially and economically self-reliant. This vision was to be realised by employing a multi-pronged approach: participatory association, mutual help, inculcating awareness and education, and microfinance to commence income generating activities.

With regard to the development of target women into self-reliant and socially recognised individuals, JBSs have undertaken a number of programmes such as creating awareness of the value of nutrition, education of children and helping elders. These programmes were supported by action programmes that included mobile libraries to promote reading habits, home-gardening, dairy farming and anti-drug campaigns. The beneficiaries are taken through a social mobilisation programme that help them to develop habits of thrift and leadership capabilities and achieve both social and human development through a participatory approach. The microfinance programme that provided small loans with minimal procedures, but on market interest rates, helped the beneficiary women to free themselves from the clutches of the village money lenders.

JBSs increased both savings and lending in 1999. Savings mobilised in the form of deposits by members increased from Rs.40 million in 1998 to Rs.46 million in

1999. Similarly, loans granted increased from Rs.178 million during 1998 to Rs.228 million during 1999. The loan portfolio far exceeded the savings mainly on account of the external funding which JBSs received from donors, a sign that they would face a serious problem of funding in the future, if such external fund flows dry out.

Even though the JBSs are a commendable experiment

at developing a viable community-based approach toward

self-improvement, these societies requires managerial

expertise, sound accounting practices and reliable fund

flows in order to sustain them as prudent and viable savings

and loan associations in the long run.

Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services (SEEDS)

Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services

(SEEDS), the enterprise arm of the non-governmental

organisation .'Sarvodaya', continued its microfinance

activities during the year under review. SEEDS, with its

new mandate as a limited liability company by guarantee,

provided a package of microfinance services to target

groups, viz.,:the rural and semi-urban poor. The main

objective of SEEDS was to uplift the living standards of

the rural poor by supplying timely credit and credit plus

services so as to enable them to commence viable and

sustainable micro-enterprises. SEEDS had disbursed Rs.504

million as micro-credit at end 1999 and mobilised Rs.425

million in savings.

Garni Pubuduwa Scheme (GPS)

The GPS, which was introduced by Hatton National Bank (HNB) as a mechanism to reach out to a wider section of the rural population, completed its tenth year of operation in 1999. The scheme operates through the HNB branch network with 98 delivery units,located in both rural and semi-urban areas. The objective of the GPS is to develop the potential micro scale borrowers and provide financial facilities to strengthen their existing economic activities and create new avenues for income generation. The total cumulative amount of loans granted under the scheme upto the end of 1999 amounted to Rs.1.2 billion covering 32,505 small and micro projects throughout the country. The outstanding loan balance at end 1999 stood at Rs.283 million in respect of 9,876 current projects. The scheme has maintained a recovery rate of 97 per cent, a very satisfactory record for a high risk micro-finance activity. The GPS also mobilised savings to a value of Rs.700 million during the entire project period.

Farmers' Banking Societies (FBSs)

Farmers' Banking Societies (FBSs), which are informal credit and savings associations, continued to be established by the Department of Agrarian Services at the Agrarian Centres (Govi Jana Kendras), during 1999. At end 1999, there were 452 such FBSs set up throughout the country. The objective of establishing FBSs was to ensure the provision of timely credit and other services to small farmers under one roof, thereby reducing their transaction costs. The farmers in this category own less than 1 hectare of paddy land and account for about 40 per cent of the farming population.

FBSs adopt a participatory approach in lending and providing other services. The fund base of FBSs consists of the following: equity participation by farmers at the rate of Rs. 100 by each farmer, savings mobilised from farmer members, grants provided by the government from time to time through voted expenditure, and funds available in the

Agricultural and Marketing Development Fund (a revolving

fund) established in 1992 in the Ministry of Agriculture and

Lands. At end 1999, 88,788 farmers had joined FBSs

providing a capital base of Rs.9 million. The savings

mobilised upto the end of 1999 amounted to Rs.8 million.

The government grant for the year 1999 was Rs.25 million.

The funds available in the revolving fund amounted to

Rs.125 million. The total value of loans granted since the

inception of FBSs in 1998 amounted to Rs.60 million. The

FBSs charge an interest of 10.5 per cent from farmers for

loans and are reported to have maintained a recovery rate

of 85 per cent during 1999.

Delivery of Rural Credit through the Co-operative Movement

Co-operative Rural Banks (CRBs) have been an important retail banking agency operating in Sri Lanka for decades. These banks were primarily the banking arms of the Multi­purpose Co-operative Societies (MPCSs), which had spread their business activities to almost all the sectors in the economy. Since the establishment of People's Bank in 1962, CRBs were nurtured by that Bank providing a host of services, banking facilities, supervision of activities, training of personnel and absorption of surplus funds. Hence, CRBs continued to play a vital role in retailing agricultural credit among rural farmers as a junior partner of People's Bank until the early 1990s. However, this relationship came under strain after People's Bank gradually moved into commercial banking proper, leaving CRBs in a state of isolation. Hence, to fill the vacuum, it was necessary to set up some kind of an apex institution to lead CRBs to play their role as viable retail banking institutions.

Having recognised this need, beginning from 1992, District Co-operative Rural Banking Unions (DCRBUs) were set up as apex bodies of CRBs in each district under the auspices of the Co-operative Development Department. By the end of 1999, 14 such DCBUs had been formed in 14 districts representing 242 MPCSs. The functions of DCBUs are to accept deposits from MPCSs, grant loans to MPCSs and invest their excess funds in suitable investments. Loans were granted to MPCSs for both working capital and investment capital purposes. The working capital loans were granted for settling bank loans, promoting customer activities, purchase of paddy etc. Investment capital loans were granted for the purchase of buildings, vehicles and equipment. The average interest rate charged from MPCSs stood between 12 per cent and 14 per cent, a concessionary rate when compared with prevailing market rates.

At end 1999, total deposits mobilised by DCRBUs from MPCSs amounted to Rs.55 million while advances remained at Rs.9 million. Accordingly, the excess funds which DCBUs placed in other types of commercial investments amounted to Rs.46 million.

194

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

Meanwhile, MPCSs continued to operate their banking units through CRBs. CRBs have spread themselves over the entire rural areas making them readily accessible to the rural population. During 1999, 1,418 such CRBs operated in the country under 299 MPCSs. The main activities of the CRBs were mobilisation of savings, extension of credit, engagement in pawning activities, collection of utility bills such as electricity bills, payment of salaries to school teachers and payment of pensions to farmers. At end 1999, CRBs had over 5.3 million savings accounts recording an increase of 12 per cent during the year. The deposits of CRBs also increased, by 15 per cent, from Rs. 11,234 million in 1998 to Rs. 12,914.7 million in 1999. Though the total deposit base showed an appreciable increase during 1999, trie fixed deposit component remained more or less stagnant; due to the failure of CRBs to compete effectively with other financial institutions which offered more attractive long term savings products.

During the year under review, the value of loans granted by CRBs amounted to Rs.350 million, as in 1998. Thus, the cumulative outstanding balance increased to Rs.4,409 million at end 1999. The CRBs have been able to maintain the same credit momentum in 1999 through the introduction of better extension and recovery services by the DCRBUs. The pawning activities of the CRBs increased significantly from an outstanding level of Rs.2,332 million in 1998, to Rs.2,824 million in 1999, an increase of 21 per cent during the year.

CRBs, as in the past, continued to serve the very micro-level depositors and borrowers in rural areas. The depositors numbering 5.3 million had maintained a total deposit level of Rs. 12,900 million, i.e., on average, a micro deposit of Rs.2,420 per depositor. On the loan portfolio side, a similar picture was also shown, with 1.2 million borrowers receiving an average loan size of Rs.5,874 per borrower. Though it is encouraging for CRBs to cater to the lowest stratum of the depositors and borrowers in the rural areas, the high administration costs of handling such a voluminous number of accounts will undoubtedly erode the viability and solvency of CRBs in the long run.

10.9 Other Financial Institutions

Savings institutions

The National Savings Bank (NSB) expanded its activities during the year. This was accompanied by a high growth in deposits and investments as well as in total resources. The total resources of the NSB grew by 11 per cent during the year compared to a growth of 9 per cent in the previous year. The NSB expanded its deposit base through its efforts in mobilisation deposits with new deposit products, opening 'savings shops', branch computerisation, aggressive advertising campaigns and also by adjusting interest rates in response to market forces in a competitive manner.

Diversification of the NSB's investment portfolio continued

with significant increases in investments in market based

government debt instruments, investments in shares and unit

trusts, debentures, commercial paper and zero coupon

bonds.

The total deposits of the NSB increased by 11 per cent

during the year and stood at Rs.93,272 million at end 1999.

In comparison, savings and fixed deposits of commercial

banks increased by 15 per cent in 1999. Savings deposits

of the NSB increased by 10 per cent, fixed deposits by 11

per cent, and other deposits including National Savings

Certificates, premium savings bonds, and the NSB pension

scheme, by 15 per cent. The NSB introduced two new

deposit schemes, the 'Prarthana Savings Account Scheme'

for children and Tthuru Mithuru Savings Scheme' for youth

during the year.

The NSB reduced its interest rates several times during the year in line with market trends. The savings deposit rate was reduced from 10.5 per cent at end December 1998 to 9.2 per cent at end December 1999. The rate on 12-month fixed deposits was maintained at 11.5 per cent throughout the year. This enabled the NSB to mark a faster rate of growth in fixed deposits than commercial banks.

Investments of the NSB increased by 10 per cent during the year and was accompanied by a diversification of its investment portfolio towards more market oriented debt instruments. Investments in Treasury bonds, which accounted for 22 per cent of total investments at end 1999, increased by 94 per cent during the year. Investments in Treasury bills, which accounted for a share of 8 per cent of total investments, increased by 17 per cent. Meanwhile, investments in other government securities increased only marginally by 0.1 per cent. Investments in debentures and unit trusts and shares increased by 26 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively. In addition, the NSB invested in commercial paper, and zero coupon bonds issued by a leasing company.

The country's main superannuation fund, the Employee's Provident Fund (EPF) recorded an increase in its activities in 1999. The total contribution received by the EPF amounted to Rs. 13,600 million during the year, an increase of 13 per cent over the level in the previous year. The total member balances of the EPF increased by 15 per cent to reach Rs. 172,000 million at end 1999, while the refunds paid to members amounted to Rs.7,500 million in 1999. The total value of EPF investments at end 1999 stood at Rs.188 billion. The EPF is the largest single investor Fund in the country. It has invested the major share of its funds in government paper.

The country's second superannuation fund, the Employee's Trust Fund (ETF), also recorded significant growth in 1999. Total assets of the ETF increased by 7 per cent to reach Rs.24,350 million at end 1999. Total

total investments compared with a 71 per cent in the

previous year. Investments in Treasury bonds and Rupee

securities rose by 89 per cent and 53 per cent, respectively,

while investments in Treasury bills decreased by 25 per

cent. Time and savings deposits with commercial banks

showed a four fold increase. Other investments, including

investments in debentures, shares, unit trusts, commercial

paper and corporate bonds, decreased by 10 per cent in

1999.

Long-Term Lending Institutions

Reflecting some slowing down in the lending activities of DFCC Bank in 1999, the value of loans approved decreased by 17 per cent to Rs.7,005 million in 1999. The number of loans approved during the year also fell from 1,418 in 1998 to 1,163 in 1999. However, the total amount of loans disbursed increased by Rs. 1,294 million to Rs.5,571 million. The total loans outstanding also increased by Rs. 1,541 million to Rs. 15,054 million at end 1999. The majority of loans disbursed during the year were to the financial sector (45 per cent) and for industrial purposes (40 per cent). The agriculture sector absorbed 10 per cent of total loans granted. The tourism sector, housing sector and commercial sector utilised 2 per cent, 1 per cent and 0.1 per cent of total loan disbursements, during the year, respectively. Of the total loans granted, loans granted for other purposes including community and social services, electricity, gas and water, and transport services accounted for 2 per cent of total loan disbursements. DFCC Bank provided Rs.l37

million for equity financing during the year. A major share (84 per cent) of equity financing was to the industrial sector.

Of the total loan outstandings, 33 per cent were long-

term, 49 per cent were medium-term and 18 per cent were

short-term. Of total loans outstanding 91 per cent were

above Rs.l million and the majority were secured loans.

Meanwhile, 88 per cent of total loan disbursements in the

year were at an interest rate in the range of 13-19 per cent

per annum.

The main sources of funds of DFCC Bank during the

year were lease amortisation (22 per cent), repayment of

loans by customers (18 per cent), NDB refinance (13 per

cent), IDA, ADB Credit Lines (12 per cent) and sale of

shares (11 per cent).

The other major long-term lending institution National Development Bank (NDB) also showed a downturn in its lending activities. The total value of loans approved dropped significantly from Rs.21,903 million in 1998 to Rs. 12,411 million in 1999. Following the same trend, the total loans granted during the year dropped by 19 per cent and stood at Rs.l 1,760 million, while the total loans outstanding decreased by 6 per cent to reach Rs.20,584 million at end 1999.

As in the previous year, the industrial sector received the largest portion of credit from the NDB and accounted for 47 per cent of total loans approved during the year. The commercial sector, the housing sector and the tourism sector accounted for 14 per cent, 7 per cent and 5 per cent of total loans approvals, respectively. The agriculture sector received 4 per cent of total loan approvals. Loans for other purposes, including electricity, gas and water, transport, shipping and warehousing accounted for 23 per cent of total

loan approvals of the year. Compared with the previous year, total loan approvals to the agriculture sector, industrial sector, tourism sector and financial sector showed a decline, while total loan approvals to the commercial sector, housing sector and other sectors indicated an improvement. All loan approvals were loans below Rs.l million and 98 per cent loans were with interest rates in the range of 12-19 per cent. Of the total loans outstanding 80 per cent were medium-term, 16 per cent were long-term and 4 per cent were short-term. The main sources of funds of the NDB were the issue of debentures (37 per cent), the repayment of loans by customers (29 per cent), and international credit lines (12 per cent).

The State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB), which focusses mainly on housing finance, increased its long-term lending activities during the year. Total loan approvals increased by 6 per cent to Rs.l,679 million, while loans granted during the year also rose from Rs. 1,248 million to Rs.1,736 million. Total loan approvals to the housing sector, which accounted for 95 per cent of total loan approvals, increased by 4 per cent during the year. Of the total 16an approvals, 87 per cent of loans were long-term (i.e. over 5-years) and 12 per cent loans were medium-

term. The majority of loan approvals were above Rs. 100,000 and secured against land and property. The total deposits of the SMIB increased from Rs.2,516 million to Rs.3,093 million at the end of 1999. The one year fixed deposit rate offered by the SMIB, which was 12 per cent at the beginning of the year, was increased to 12.5 per cent in February 1999. Lending rates remained at 15-17 per cent during the year. The total assets of the SMIB increased to Rs.7,459 million, an increase of 12 per cent during the year. The main sources of funds of the SMIB were repayment of loans by customers (67 per cent) and fixed deposits (25 per cent of total sources of funds).

Loans approved and granted by the two private savings and development banks (PSDBs) decreased to Rs. 1,720 million, a decrease of 18 per cent over the year. The major recipients of credit were the commercial sector (55 per cent), industrial sector (12 per cent) and housing sector (4 per cent). Of the total loan oustandings, 68 per cent were medium-term, 27 per cent were short-term and 5 per cent were long-term. The majority of loans were above Rs.l million loans and carried an interest rate above 20 per cent. The main sources of funds of the PSDBs were deposits and repayments of loans by customers and new capital contributions.

than in 1998 (17 per cent). In comparison, total assets of

commercial banks increased by 14 per cent in 1999 and 13

per cent in 1998. Finance company assets amount to

approximately 5 per cent of the assets of the domestic units

of commercial banks.

Loans and advances form the most important

component of assets (65 per cent), followed by investments

(14 per cent), and fixed assets (8 per cent). Although slight

variations are seen, this composition has remained stable.

On the liabilities side, fixed deposits accounted for 59 per

cent of the total in 1999, while capital and reserves

provided 15 per cent, other liabilities 12 per cent and

borrowings accounted for 7 per cent. Borrowings increased

in importance as a source of funds in 1998 and have

remained approximately at the same level in 1999. Although

provisions for bad and doubtful debt recorded a moderate

growth in 1999, the bad and doubtful debt as a percentage

of total assets remained unchanged at a 3 per cent level in

1999. Capital and reserves have increased as a proportion

of total liabilities. This is a healthy development in that it

increases the stability of the sector by increasing its ability

to withstand short-term fluctuations in profitability.

Loans and advances, the major category of assets of

FCs, recorded a slightly lower growth in 1999 (17 per cent)

The Housing Development Finance Corporation of Sri

Lanka (HDFC), whose primary function is to provide loans

for housing development in Sri Lanka, approved 3,115

loans to the value of Rs.540 million in 1999. In

comparison, 4,908 loans to the value of Rs.684 million

were approved in 1998. The total value of loans disbursed

during the year was Rs.525 million, a marginal decrease

from the previous year. The term structure of loans

indicates that 97 per cent of loans were long-term. The

majority of loans were above Rs. 100,000 and were secured

against a property mortgage and carried an interest rate of

16-19 per cent. The major source of funds for the HDFC

were recovery of interest, repayments of loans by customers

and new capital contributions. The National Housing

Development Authority (NHDA) also continued to engage

in providing credit facilities for housing activities. The

NHDA approved Rs.2,140 million in 1999. Total loans

granted increased from Rs.860 million to Rs.1,116 million.

All the loans granted were below Rs.50,000 and carried an

interest rate of 10-16 per cent.

Finance Companies

The total assets/liabilities of finance companies (FCs)

expanded at a slightly higher rate in 1999 (17.7 per cent)

198

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

than in 1998 (18 per cent). In comparison, credit to the

private sector from the domestic banking units of

commercial banks was 13 per cent in 1998 and 12 per cent

in 1999. Some diversification has been seen in the structure

of the portfolio of loans and advances. The share of credit

given for leasing has increased at the expense of credit for

hire purchase and real estate development though the

finance companies face stiff competition in leasing activities

from some commercial banks and other specialised

institutions in this field. The imposition of the Goods and

Services Tax (GST) has affected the hire purchase business,

as customers are required to bear the GST for the total

market value of the vehicle without regard to the amount

of the refinance facility, when a hire purchase contract is

entered into with a FC. The reduced lending for real estate

development is attributed to the prevailing sluggish market

conditions in real estate activity.

The portion of investments in FCs assets amounted to

14 per cent, of which more than one half is invested in

government paper. However, investments in government

paper slowed down in 1999. Other assets of FCs increased

by 46 per cent in 1999, in comparison to the 9 per cent

growth recorded in 1998, attributed mainly to an increase

in trading activities in some imported goods, resulting in

the holding of increased stocks. Meanwhile, cash and bank

balances of FCs rose by 20 per cent in 1999, in comparison

to a drop by 22 per cent in 1998.

Total deposits of FCs (including fixed deposits and certificates of deposit), the major component of liabilities, increased at a faster rate in 1999 (19 per cent) than in 1998 (14 per cent). Correspondingly, the growth in borrowings slowed down, although borrowings remained a more important source of funds than in 1997. Meanwhile, provision for bad and doubtful debt of FCs increased by 14 per cent in 1999, in comparison to a drop by 34 per cent in 1998. The capital base of FCs increased by 25 per cent in 1999, with a surge in undistributed profits.

10.10. Specialised Financial Institutions

Merchant Banking

The total number of merchant banks remained at 10 in

1999. A mixed performance was seen among the companies, with the industry as a whole recording a net loss on operations, although a growth in total assets was experienced. The downturn in economic activity in the first half of the year and the depressed stock market affected merchant bank profitability adversely. The total assets of the 10 merchant banks increased by 11 per cent to reach Rs.21,830 million. The total income of merchant banks stood at Rs. 1,940 million, an increase of 30 per cent in

1999. The major sources of income were leasing, interest on Treasury bills, interest on discounting trade bills and

interest on loans. Given the lacklustre performance of the

share market, merchant banks focussed their operations and

funds on other activities and investments. Consequently, the

growth in income was mainly through increased income

from leasing and interest on Treasury bills. Profits on

investment in shares however, amounted to Rs.21 million

in 1999, in contrast to a loss of Rs.431 million in 1998.

Decreases were recorded in dividends received, income

from financial and marketing consultancy services, interest

on discounting trade bills and interest on loans. The pre­

tax profit of merchant banks declined further during the

year, from a loss of Rs.40 million in 1998 to a loss of

Rs.503 million in 1999. Of the 10 merchant banks in

operation, five incurred losses. One had a substantial loss,

accounting for more than 75 per cent of the total pre-tax

loss in the industry.

Leasing Companies

Five specialised leasing companies engaged in leasing

activities during the year. A growth in the industry was

seen as evident from the growth in total lease finance

provided and total assets. The total assets of the leasing

industry reached Rs. 12,308 million, an increase of 23 per

cent over the previous year. The total lease finance provided

by the companies increased by 16 per cent and stood at

Rs.5,417 million at end 1999. As in the previous year, lease

finance was mainly for commercial vehicles (56 per cent)

and passenger vehicles (20 per cent). Lease financing for

commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles increased but

decreased for plant and machinery and for office equipment.

In terms of the sector-wise classification, as in the

previous yean the trading sector received the major portion

of finance, provided (40 per cent) and showed an increase

of 54 per cent over the previous year. Leasing facilities to

the services sector, which accounted for 19 per cent of total

finance, showed a 5 per cent decrease in 1999. Finance

facilities to the transport sector and industry sector, which

accounted, respectively, for 18 per cent and 16 per cent of

total lease financing provided, increased by 1 per cent and

10 per cent, respectively. Lease financing to the agriculture

sector and other sectors showed a decline in 1999.

Leasing companies indicated that the industry faced

problems such as the high cost of funds, non-availability

of long-term funds, increased overdues, and GST imposed

on leases. The need for a regulatory and legislative

framework governing the leasing industry was also noted.

Venture Capital Companies

The total, number of venture capital companies (VCCs)

operating in the country remained seven in 1999. Activities

of the venture capital companies showed some setback

during the year. Funds, used for investment purposes

decreased by, 15 per cent. VCCs continued to provide long-

term capital for the commencement of new business,

expansion of existing ventures, acquisitions and buyouts, in

addition to investing in shares and'other financial

instruments. Investments in equity came down from

Rs.1,639 million in 1998 to Rs.1,327 million in 1999.

Equity investment for commencement of operations, which

holds the major share (57 per cent) of equity investments,

decreased by 68 per cent during the year. Financing for

expansion of ventures stood at Rs.322 million, an increase

of 3 per cent over the previous year. Provision of funds

for acquisition and buyouts increased from Rs.84 million

to Rs. 162 million in 1999. The total number of projects

assisted by the VCCS increased from 136 in 1998 to 232

projects in 1999. The increase of 96 was accompanied by

a large number of projects under the Graduate Entrepreneurs

Loans Programme, and the Non-Graduate Educated Youth

Programme. In terms of the sectors that received funds, the

manufacturing sector and the services sector were the major

recipients of funds. Total assets of the VCCS grew by 1

per cent during the year.

VCCs are required to invest in specified risk ventures

under Inland Revenue Department guidelines, if they wish

to obtain certain tax advantages. The Budget for the year

2000 introduced a proposal to amend the Inland Revenue

Department guidelines to enable approved venture capital

companies to opt out of the tax holiday during the balance

part of the tax holiday period and to expand investments

in diversified activities such as in the priority sectors, and

the software industry.

Insurance Companies

The insurance industry became more competitive in 1999

with the establishment of two new insurance companies,

thereby increasing the total number of insurance companies

to nine. The two new companies are the Co-operative

Insurance Co. Ltd. and the Asian Alliance Insurance Co.

Ltd. The activities of the insurance institutions increased

during the year in the midst of intense competition. Growth

was seen in the total assets base. Total assets of insurance

companies (excluding Asian Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd.

which commenced its business activities in January 2000)

increased by 2 per cent to reach Rs.26,375 million at end

1999. However, net profits decreased by 1 per cent in 1999.

The total branch network increased from 270 to 285 at end

1999, while the total employment in the industry was 7,075

as at end 1999. Life insurance activities as well as general

insurance activities showed an improvement during the year.

The life assurance fund increased by 19 per cent to

Rs. 19,353 million at end 1999. The total premium collected

in respect of new business increased to Rs. 1,438 million,

an increase of 9 per cent during 1999. The sums insured

for new business also rose by 13 per cent. Meanwhile, the

total number of policies of business in force increased to

903,000 at end 1999. The total sums insured and the total

premium collected in respect of business in force rose by

12 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. Total benefit

payments on maturity, death and disability, surrender and

others increased from Rs.l,309 million to Rs.l,701 million

as at end 1999.

Net premia for policies in force with regard to general insurance increased by 9 per cent to Rs.4,969 million. Motor insurance and general accident insurance were the biggest sectors in general insurance category. Net premia on motor insurance and general accident insurance rose by

13 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. Net premia for fire insurance rose from Rs.561 million to Rs.577 million at end

1999. Following the same trend net premia on marine insurance rose by 4 per cent during the year.

Major changes are being effected in the policies relating to the insurance industry, including legislation which would lead to basic changes in the regulatory framework. The Budget for the year 2000 proposed permitting non-nationals to participate more in financial sector activities in the domestic economy. As a part of this process, the present restrictions on foreign equity holdings in insurance companies will be relaxed by allowing foreign ownership of upto 90 per cent in insurance companies.

10.11 Money Market

Overall Trends

Financial market stability was maintained throughout the

year, despite some uncertainty resulting from factors such

2 0 0

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

as elections, labour unrest, increased government borrowing and the Year 2000 issue. Although some volatility in call market rates were observed in March and April due to Provincial Council elections and labour unrest, the call money market and foreign exchange market were stable with the call market rates fluctuating within a relatively narrow range. The call market was generally liquid in 1999. Towards the latter part of the year the Central Bank took several steps to ensure the availability of liquidity in the market to counter any destabilising effects that could arise due to the Year 2000 problem. These measures achieved their intended purpose and the money market experienced no untoward developments in December.

Inter Bank Call Money Market

The improved liquidity situation in the market, particularly

in the early part of the second half of 1999 due to the

reduction of the SRR, and increased inter-bank activity led

to a rise in the total turnover in the call money market from

Rs.880,567 million in 1998 to Rs.955,054 million in 1999.

Apart from some volatility of call market rates observed in

March and April 1999, call market rates varied within a

relatively narrow band of around 9.25-17.00 per cent

throughout the year. The stability arose mainly because of

the open ended repo and reverse repo facilities maintained

by the Central Bank.

Primary Treasury Bill Market

Primary market yield rates on Treasury bills were generally

stable throughout the year, compared to the slight rise in

Treasury bill yield rates experienced, particularly in the second half, in 1998. The availability of liquidity in the market led to the over-subscriptions at all Treasury bill auctions, excluding one held in June. The total value of Treasury bills offered in the primary market was Rs. 186,490 million in 1999 compared to Rs.217,022 million in 1998. The total outstanding level of Treasury bills increased from Rs. 119,966 million at end 1998 to Rs. 124,996 million in 1999. The current limit on government borrowing through Treasury bills, approved by Parliament, stood at Rs. 125,000 million.

As a part of its monetary policy operations, and on one occasion, due to the under-subscription at the auction, the Central Bank purchased Rs.34,725 million worth of Treasury bills at the primary market auctions as against purchases of Rs.25,999 million in 1998. These purchases included Treasury bills reserved for the Central Bank, amounting to Rs.22,800 million in 1999 compared to Rs. 11,600 million, in 1998, at the primary Treasury bill auctions. There were three special issues amounting to Rs.5,000 million, which were purchased entirely by the Central Bank. These operations resulted in the book value of the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills increasing from Rs.8,233 million at end 1998 to Rs.25,165 million at end 1999. It should be noted that a significant portion of this increase was in December, as the Bank injected liquidity into the market to provide stability in the context of the Year 2000 problem.

A new day count formula for Treasury bills, based on international norms, was introduced with effect from 20

October 1999. Accordingly, Treasury bills were issued thereafter with 91 days, 182 days and 364 days of day counts to maturity instead of the 3-month, 6-month and 12-month Treasury bills issued upto 15 October 1999. This is intended to bring about uniformity with regard to day count without any time lag. Moreover, no 3-month Treasury bills were offered at the auctions on 22 September, 29 September and 06 October 1999, in order to reduce the amount of bills maturing towards the end of December 1999, as a precautionary measure to address any shortage in market liquidity arising from the Y2K issue.

Central Bank Secondary Market for Treasury Bills

The sales (discounting) of Treasury bills from the secondary window of the Central Bank declined substantially from Rs. 1-1,390 million in 1998 to Rs.6,826 million in 1999. Similarly, purchases (rediscounting) of Treasury bills also fell significantly from Rs. 14,862 million to Rs.1,426 million during the period under review reflecting the improved liquidity in the market.

Discount and rediscount rates in the secondary window of the Central Bank followed the trends witnessed in the primary market rates. With a view to encouraging the open market operations, the spread between the discount and rediscount rates, which was 3.15 percentage points at the beginning of the year was adjusted downward to 2.65 percentage points on 07 May and was maintained at the same level during the rest of the year.

Central Bank Repurchase (Repo) Market for Treasury Bills

During 1999, the major instrument of monetary policy continued to be open market operations, and as such, the Bank's repo and reverse repo windows were used extensively for these operations. Most commercial banks, and to a smaller extent non bank Primary Dealers, who also have access, to the Central Bank's repurchase window, continued to make use of this facility to invest their short-term funds.

In view of steady decline in inflation and stable foreign exchange market, the overnight repo rate was gradually adjusted downward in several steps in 1999 and stood at 9.25 per cent at end 1999 compared to 11.25 per cent at end 1998.

• Repo sales amounted to Rs. 307,636 million in 1999 in comparison to Rs.728,335 million in 1998.

Central Bank Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Market for Treasury Bills

The Central Bank's reverse repurchase facility was

reintroduced in 1998. It is generally restricted to overnight

transactions, but is open ended. Commercial banks and

Primary Dealers are permitted to obtain liquidity, provided

they have the required collateral, i.e., Treasury bills and

bonds. High volumes were transacted particularly in April

and December 1999, due to the temporary shortage of

liquidity that prevailed during that period. This resulted in

reverse repurchase sales in 1999 of Rs. 124,956 million

when compared with Rs. 1,065 million in 1998. The reverse

repo rate is linked to the yield on 3-month Treasury bills.

The overnight reverse repo rate which was 15.00 per cent

at end 1998, moved in a range of 13.41-15.00 per cent

during 1999 and was 13.48 per cent at end December 1999.

From the mid December 1999, the Central Bank

extended the maturity period for reverse repo transactions

from overnight to 30 days and maintained the reverse repo

rate at a fixed level, to reduce volatility in the call market

rates, due to uncertainties and aberrations caused by the

Y2K issue.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The Central Bank continued to operate in the domestic

foreign exchange market, by trading its intervention

currency, the US dollar, against Sri Lanka rupee. The Bank

quotes daily spot buying and selling rates for the US dollar

for transactions with commercial banks. The spread between

the spot buying and selling rates which was revised upward

in 1995 from 1 per cent to 2 per cent, was maintained at

the same level. The Central Bank middle rate depreciated

by 6.0 per cent from Rs.67.7800 per US dollar at the end

of 1998 to Rs.72.1150 per US dollar at the end of 1999.

Purchases by the Central Bank from commercial banks

declined from US 61.1 million in 1998 to US dollars 0.4

million in 1999. Meanwhile, sales of foreign exchange by

the Central Bank to commercial banks was also low in

1999, amounting to US dollars 58.2 million, in comparison

to US dollars 214.8 million in 1998. Hence, net purchases

of foreign exchange from the Central Bank by commercial

banks declined from US dollars 154 million in 1998 to US

dollars 57.8 million in 1999. Total inter-bank turnover

amounted to US dollars 2,382 million in 1999 compared to

US dollars 4,409 million in 1998. The inter-bank forward

transactions declined from US dollars 696 million in 1998

to US dollars 458 million in 1999.

With a view to providing exporters with relatively low cost funds to improve their international competitiveness, a scheme was introduced with effect from January 1997, permitting commercial banks to grant foreign currency loans to non-BOl exporters either from their domestic units or from their FCBUs. Under this scheme, a gross sum of US dollars 124.1 million (approximately Rs.8,754 million) was granted as credit during 1999 as against US dollars 177 million (approximately Rs.11,425 million) granted in 1998. This resulted from the decline in attractiveness of domestic borrowers obtaining foreign currency loans. Under this

2 0 2

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

scheme, a gross sum of US dollars 555.4 million

(approximately 35,195 million) had been granted upto end

1999. The outstanding level of credit stood at US dollars

34.6 million at end December 1999.

Central Bank Securities

In view of availability of government paper in the Central

Bank's portfolio for open market operations, there was no

necessity to issue Central Bank securities in 1999.

Commercial Paper (CP)

Commercial paper continued to be issued during the year as a way of meeting short-term liquidity requirements of corporates at attractive rate of interest. Listed companies as well as merchant banks issue commercial papers with maturity periods of 3-6 months. Such paper can be supported by commercial banks, subject to the guidelines issued by the Central Bank.

The gross issues of commercial paper, including reissues, in 1999 was Rs. 16,203 million compared to Rs. 16,457 million in 1998. (This value relates only to CP issued with the involvement of either commercial banks or merchant banks). During 1999, merchant banks issued Rs.642 million of commercial paper on their own account, while they supported companies to issue commercial paper totalling Rs. 1,337 million. However, the bulk of commercial paper, amounting to Rs. 14,224 million (88 per cent), was issued with the support of the commercial banks. The outstanding value of commercial paper at end 1999 was Rs.4,356 million. During the year, the yield on commercial paper varied within a range of 11.50-18.00 per cent per annum.

10.12 Capital Market

Although some improvements in stock prices were seen at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in some months of 1999, the year as a whole saw an overall decline in share prices. Many Asian and international markets improved during the year as the East Asian countries recovered from the financial crisis in 1997 and 1998. However, a corresponding improvement was not seen in the Sri Lankan market. Market sources attributed this to the uncertainty associated with elections and the poor performance of some major listed companies during the first half of the year. Of the 16 sectors in the market, only 5 sectors showed an improvement in prices during the year. The All Share Price Index declined by 4.2 per cent and the new price index, the Milanka Price Index, introduced in place of the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) with effect from 4 January 1999 (1998=1000), declined by 6.2 per cent. However, the decline in prices was less than in 1998, which recorded a 15 per cent decline in the ASPI and a 13 per cent decline in the SPI. Foreign investors continued to be net sellers, with the net outflow amounting to US dollars 13 million, compared1 with a net outflow of US dollars 23 million in

1998. Meanwhile, market capitalisation decreased by 3 per cent in 1999. There were 4 new listings and 7 delistings of companies during the year, resulting in the number of companies listed on the CSE declining to 237 at the end of 1999, from 240 at the end of 1998. Three plantation companies, a bank and a hotel sector company made Initial Public Offers (IPO). Only two of these offers, were over­subscribed.

A positive feature of the capital market was a further development in the corporate debt market during the year. Five listed debenture issues were made by five companies, viz., two commercial banks, a merchant bank, a development bank and a leasing company, during the year. The total value of issues amounted to Rs. 1,770 million. In contrast to the equity IPOs, all debenture issues were over­subscribed. By end 1999, the market capitalisation of listed debenture amounted to Rs.4.6 billion compared to Rs.3.7 billion at the end of 1998. This expansion in listed corporate debt instruments is encouraging as it broadens the capital market and provides an alternative avenue of investment for savers, while helping companies to raise funds.

A continued expansion in market based government bond issues was seen during the year. The issue of market oriented Treasury bonds commenced in 1997 and by end 1998 issues had been made for three maturities, i.e., 2, 3 and 4 years. During 1999, 5-year and 6-year bonds were also introduced. Treasury bonds carry a coupon rate and are sold by auction. The total issue of new Treasury bonds, which amounted to Rs. 10,000 million in 1997, rose to Rs.38,915 million in 1998 and Rs. 63,452 million in 1999.

Primary Market

During 1999 five IPOs were made by three plantation companies, (Metropolitan Resource Holdings Ltd. and Namunukula Plantations Ltd. and Talawakele Plantations

The par value per share of all five issues was Rs.10, while Namunukula Plantations Ltd. (premium Rs.5), Metropolitan Resources Holdings Ltd. (premium Rs.l5) and the Nations Trust Bank Ltd. (premium Rs.2) issued shares at a premium. The issues made by Nations Trust Bank Ltd. and Talawakele Plantations Ltd. were over-subscribed. The total value of shares subscribed by the public and the underwriters was Rs.441 million. The total value of rights issues made during 1999 was Rs.1,008 million compared with Rs. 1,960 million during 1998. Meanwhile, bonus issues were made by 17 companies to the value of Rs.858 million.

The debt securities market saw a further development with five listed debentures being issued during the year. These issues were made by 5 listed companies, viz., Mercantile Leasing Ltd., People's Merchant Bank Ltd., Sampath Bank Ltd., National Development Bank and the Seylan Bank Ltd. The maturity period of the debentures varied from 4-5 years, while they carried interest rates ranging from 13.5 per cent to 16.0 per cent per annum. The National Development Bank offered a floating rate of interest. All the issues were over-subscribed and the total amount raised through these issues was Rs. 1,770 million.

reached 572.5 and 937.5 respectively, at the end of the

year. This decline was attributed mainly to investor caution

due to uncertainty generated by elections and the poor

performance recorded by many major listed companies

during the early part of the year.

Market capitalisation of the CSE fluctuated during the

year, reflecting the movements of share prices. Following

some improvement in prices, the highest level of market

capitalisation recorded during the year, Rs. 113,600 million,

was seen in July. The lowest level during the year was

recorded in March (Rs. 104,900 million). For the year as a

whole, market capitalisation declined by 3 per cent and

stood at Rs. 112,800 million at the end of December 1999.

Nearly 40 per cent of market capitalisation in Sri Lanka

comes from 10 institutions, namely, John Keells Holdings,

Ceylon Tobacco, DFCC Bank, HNB, NDB, Commercial

Bank, Hayleys, Aitken Spence, Nestle Lanka and Coca

Cola. Four of these are financial institutions, including two

commercial banks.

Total turnover too declined, from Rs.18,130 million in

1998 to Rs.14,294 million in 1999. The average daily

turnover decreased from Rs.75 million in 1998 to Rs.59

million in 1999. The highest monthly turnover, amounting

to Rs.2,109 million, was recorded in July while the lowest

turnover, Rs.481 million, was recorded in April. The largest

share (30 per cent) of the total turnover was in the banks,

finance and insurance sector. The market price earnings

ratio (PER) remained at a low level. During January-May

1999, it was in the range of 8-9, but declined to 5.8 in

June, the lowest level recorded during the year. Thereafter,

it saw a slight improvement and remained in the range of

6-7. PER at the end of December was 6.6.

Foreign investor participation at the Colombo Stock Market continued to be at a low level during the year. Although major regional and international stock markets recovered from the adverse impact of the Asian crisis and recorded healthy returns in 1999, a net foreign outflow continued to be recorded at the CSE. Overall foreign transactions during the year recorded a net foreign outflow of Rs.902 million (US dollars 13 million), although this was much less than the net outflow of Rs.1,517 million (US dollars 23 million) recorded in 1998. As in 1998, foreign participation accounted for approximately 35 per cent of the total turnover during 1999.

Sectoral Performance

Sectoral price indices saw declines in prices for most sectors during the year. Of the 16 sectors, price decreases were recorded in 11 sectors. The trading sector was the biggest loser with prices decreasing by 18 per cent. Among the other sectors which had significant decreases in prices were construction and engineering, footwear and textile, banks, finance and insurance, manufacturing, beverage, food and tobacco and services. The oil palms sector indicated the highest growth in prices (41.2 per cent). Motors, hotels and travel, stores and supplies and diversified also achieved price improvements during the year.

Regional and Major International Stock Markets

Most regional and Western stock markets performed well in 1999. Among the regional markets significant improvements in prices were seen in Singapore (73 per cent), Seoul (65 per cent), Jakarta (64 per cent), Hong Kong (63 per cent), Bombay (61 per cent), Karachi (48 per cent) and Kuala Lumpur (45 per cent). Among others, Bangkok, Sydney, Taipei and Manila recorded improvements in price indices.

In the developed markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index for the New York Stock Exchange recorded a 30 per cent growth, while the Nikkei Stock Exchange

Index for Tokyo and the Financial Times Stock Exchange

Index for London recorded 29 per cent and 21 per cent

increases, respectively.

Developments in the Market

The Colombo Stock Exchange, expanded its activity beyond Colombo opening its first Investor Services Centre (ISC) in Matara in June 1999, with the objective of improving the domestic investor base. The ISC will provide investors in the Southern Province with facilities similar to those enjoyed by investors in Colombo, such as access to online trading, share prices and online information, stock broking services and other connected facilities, including the opening of accounts in the Central Depository System

(CDS) and deposits of share certificates. The ISC will also act as an information centre for market information and listed company information and will conduct awareness programmes for the benefit of investors and other interested parties on the activities of the capital market.

A new price index, the Milanka Price Index (MPI), was introduced on 04 January 1999 in place of the Sensitive Price Index (SPI). Its base value was set at 1000 on 31 December 1998. In selecting companies to be included in the MPI, the major criteria used were market size, which is measured by market capitalisation, and liquidity, which is the frequency of transactions. In addition, the returns on shares, which is the difference between the nominal price and market price, the dividend record of the company and the earnings per share have also been taken into consideration. Based on these factors, 25 companies are included in the MPI. The sectors represented in the MPI include banks, finance and insurance, beverages, food and tobacco, construction and engineering, diversified, hotels and travels, manufacturing and plantations. These 25 companies account for approximately 10 per cent of all listed companies and 55 per cent of the total market capitalisation. The CSE plans to revise the companies included in the MPI annually. According to a study done by the CSE, the correlation between the ASPI and the MPI is 99.5 per cent, which shows that the MPI reflects the movement of the market.

The Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Limited (MBSL) introduced a new share price index named the 'Midcap Index' in September 1999 to measure the price movements of medium size companies. This index is based on 25 stocks, selected on the basis of market size, liquidity and the profitability. The base index was set at 1000 at 31 December 1998. The index increased by 0.6 per cent to reach 1006 at the end of December 1999.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also plans to permit brokers to engage in margin trading and dealing activities to provide stock brokers additional ways of generating revenue. At present, the only source of revenue of stock brokers is the transaction commissions. With effect from November 1999, the SEC introduced a set of new rules to activate the debt market.

Duff and Phelps Credit Rating Lanka Limited (DCR Lanka), the first credit rating agency in Sri Lanka, was established during the year as a public limited liability company. Duff and Phelps Credit Rating Company, USA (DCR USA),which is a global rating agency, is the major shareholder and is also the technical partner in DCR Lanka Limited. (See Box 10).

Medium and Long-term Government Securities

Treasury Bonds

The issue of Treasury bonds, which commenced in 1997, continued to expand in 1999, giving signals to the market

on the expected direction of medium-term interest rates. The

issue of these bonds provides the private sector with

medium-term benchmark interest rates and also provides a

risk free yield for a period of beyond the one year provided

by the Treasury bills. Reflecting the popularity of Treasury

bonds among the public, all auctions were over-subscribed.

It also appears that customers at the reverse repurchase

window at the Central Bank prefer to use Treasury bonds

rather than Treasury bills as collateral. This is possibly due

to these bonds currently being held mainly as long-term

investments.

Another major development in the Treasury bond market in 1999 was the issue of longer maturities of Treasury bonds, viz., 5-year and 6-year Treasury bonds, in March 1999 and in September 1999, respectively. This was a further step in providing a medium-term risk free yield curve. The coupon rates for these issues were 11.75 per cent and 12.00 per cent, respectively. Jumbo issues which were introduced in 1998, continued in 1999 with the issues of 18 series of Treasury bonds. These issues comprised 4 series of 2-year bonds (13 issues), 6 series of 3-year bonds (24 issues), 5 series of 4-year bonds (17 issues), 2 series of 5-year bonds (7 issues) and 1 series of 6-year bonds (one issue) during the year. In contrast to the rising trend observed in 1998, yield rates on Treasury bonds were relatively stable in 1999. The yield on 2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year Treasury bonds were in the ranges of 12.64-13.42 per cent, 12.79-13.95 per cent and 13.21-14.02 per cent and 13.30-13.97 per cent, respectively. The yield on 6-year bonds at the single auction held for that maturity was 13.65 per cent. The total gross value of Treasury bonds issued under the different series amounted to Rs.63,452 million in 1999, while Treasury bonds are gradually replacing Rupee loans as the means by which the government borrows long-term. New Treasury bond issues, which amounted to Rs. 10,000 million in 1997, were Rs.28,915 in 1998 and Rs.55,952 in 1999. At end 1999, the total value of outstanding Treasury bonds stood at Rs.l 13,822 million. Reverse repo transactions in Treasury bonds at the Central Bank secondary window increased substantially from Rs.381 million in 1998 to Rs.75,634 million in 1999.

Meanwhile, a special issue of 3-year Treasury bonds

amounting to Rs. 1,500 million was made in May, 1999.

This issue enabled the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd.

to reinvest its maturing rupee loans amounting to Rs. 1,500

million. Moreover, no bids were accepted at the auction

held on 07 October 1999, owing to bid rates being

unacceptably high.

Rupee Loans

Under the Rupee loan programme, government obtains medium-and long-term funds to finance its expenditure. In

Box 10 Credit Rating

Credit rating is an assessment of the creditworthiness

of an issuer of a debt or. equity instrument. The issuer

could be a firm or a sovereign government. Credit

rating is a product that has developed in the market

to counter problems of 'asymmetric information'.

? Asymmetric information is the term used to describe

a situation where, when two parties are involved in

a transaction, one party may have more information

than the other about factors affecting the performance

of the market, such as the product quality arid the

nature of the market. The existence of asymmetric

, information could give rise to two problems, 'adverse

selection' and 'moral hazard'.

Adverse selection refers to a situation where, in

a selection process, those with higher than average risk

get selected!-Adverse selection occurs before a

transaction takes place. Adverse selection arises since

it is difficult at: the outset to distinguish between good

and. bad .'credit risks.; In the financial field potential bad

credit risks are the ones who.most actively seek out

. loans. Thus, the parties who are the most likely to

produce an undesirable outcome are those that are the

most likely to want to engage' in the transaction. • Because adverse selection increases the chances- that a

-loan might be made to a bad credit risk,;lenders may

decide not to make any loans, even though there are

good credit risks in the market place'.

Moral hazard refers to a situation.where a individual or firm takes advantage of special knowledge, while engaging in socially uneconomic behaviour.. Moralshazard arises after the transaction; occurs. The lender runs the risk that the borrower will engage in activities that are undesirable from the lender's, point of view because they make it less likely that the loan will be paid back. Thus, lenders may decide that they would rather not make a loan.'

Asymmetric information problems could lead to market failure as illustrated in the seminal work by Akerlof2. Akerlof showed that any doubts or lack of information on the quality of goods could lead to demand suppression. Thus, buyers of goods are only willing to pay a lower price. However,,suppliers with ' good quality products1 are not willing to supply at those

1 Mishkin, F.S.,-1995, 'The Economics of Money, Banking . and Financial Markets', Fourth Edition, Harper Collins;

New York 2 Akerlof,' G., 1970, 'The Market for Lemons: Quality i -' Uncertainty and Market Mechanism', Quarterly Journal ; o f Economics, 89:488-500

prices. Thus, the absence of; any mechanism to verify

the quality will lead to the failure of the market.

One of the solution's to the asymmetric

information problem is the production of private

information. Credit information and credit rating

provide information on the repayment. capability of

borrowers and.avoids the adverse selection problem to

a large extent. Since the beginning of the nineteenth

century,: individuals and organisations have; been

engaged in producing private information in the United

States of America. For example, in 1909 John Moody

(1868-1958) published Moody's Manual of Industrial

and Corporate Securities.: Duff and Phelps Corporation

has provided credit rating services to its-research

clients since 1932.

The production and dissemination of private

information on a formal basis began in Sri Lanka in

1990 when the Credit Information ,Bureau was

established. The Bureau provides credit information on

borrowers to banks. DCR Lanka Credit Rating

Company established in 1999 provides credit rating.-i.e.

information on the financial strength and risks

associated with corporate borrowers including banks.3

:; ; Credit rating is an opinion of a rating company

on the creditworthiness of an issuer of a debt orrequity

and the risk involved with such an instrument. The

most creditworthy issuer and the least risky instrument

is rated AAA. The least creditworthy issuer, and most

risky -instrument is rated DDD. However, different

rating agencies could use different symbols as

illustrated in Table 1. Borrowers with lower credit

ratings would generally have to offer an additional

premium to cover the increased risk of default.

Although there are many rating agencies

operating in the world, the four major ones are,

Moody's, Standard and Poor, Duff and Phelps and

Fitch IBCA. The two agencies, DCR and Fitch IBCA

merged in March 2000. A company or a sovereign

nation could attain ratings from one or more rating

agencies. Generally, the ratings given by different

agencies for the same institution or country tally

closely, though there could be differences at times.

Credit ratings are provided on business firms as

well as on sovereign governments. Sovereign ratings

are usually provided at the request of sovereign

governments. Often, when governments have a need to

raise funds by issuing debt instruments in international

capital markets they obtain sovereign ratings.

According to the DCR Rating Company, long-term

debt instruments issued by many developed countries

are rated AAA, whereas debt instruments of middle

income countries are rated BBB. These are indicative

of sovereign ratings of those countries. Sri Lanka has

not yet obtained a sovereign rating. Any corporate

issuer in a country is rated in relation to the domestic

market situation. For example, a debt instrument in a

country could be rated AAA in the domestic market,

although the sovereign rating could be BBB.

However, the international rating of the domestic debt

is conducted by taking into account the sovereign

rating., Rating scales adopted in Sri Lanka are given

in Table 2.

The rating process adopted by DCRL relies on an exchange of ideas between DCRL and the management of the Turn requiring the rating. The process begins when a firm formally requests a rating and provides necessary preliminary information. Discussions are held with the management to obtain a thorough understanding of the issuer's operational, financial and strategic goals. Once a rating is formulated, it is presented to the Credit Rating Committee for discussion of relevant issues. The Rating Committee comprises the chief executive officer of DCRL, DCR regional heads and industry specialists and is independent of the Board of Directors of DCR. The rating is then communicated to the firm along with the key rating considerations. If the firm disagrees with the rating, there is an appeal process whereby the firm is able to provide additional information. Subsequently, the final rating is announced, and a detailed credit analysis is made available to the public. The firm may

Box 10 (contd.)

keep the rating private, if it so wishes. The first debt

market issue rated by DCRL was a listed debenture

issue by Sri Lanka Telecom for Rs. 2 billion. This

issue was rated AA+.

DCRL will continue to monitor economic,

industry and corporate events to ensure that the offered

rating is an accurate reflection of the firm's credit risk

at all times. A long term approach is adopted with

regard to revision of any ratings. If a significant

change occurs in the underlying fundamental credit

strength of the firm or specific debt issue, then the

ratings may be placed under review.

The availability of credit rating will enhance

financial market efficiency through investor confidence

and market transparency. It encourages issuers of debt

instruments to be cautious and disciplined. It

dissipates the adverse selection problem and the

continuous re-assessment of rating may also discourage

moral hazard. Efficient and transparent financial

market will further encourage channelling funds from

domestic savers to investors, and will also encourage

foreign investment. This will enhance the capital

formation of a country, which formation will help a

developing country like Sri Lanka to realise catch-up

growth and enhance the degree of economic

development.

However, it should be clearly understood that a credit rating is not a guarantee of the performance of the rated company or country. It is an assessment made by the rating company based on the information available to it. Thus, though investors could certainly benefit from such ratings, it would be unwise for investors to following ratings blindly.

Many countries, which regularly raise funds in international debt/capital markets, obtain sovereign ratings from at least two major rating agencies, mainly from Moody's and Standard and Poor. Some countries have obtained ratings from three or more rating agencies. Similarly, most international debt/capital market issues by non-sovereign borrowers, i. e. major companies, are rated by those rating agencies. Rating is costly. In addition to the initial rating fee, regular borrowers in international debt markets are required to pay an annual fee for the review and maintenance of rating. Sometimes these fees are waived or are subject to concessions, depending on the frequency of debt issues. There are also other fees, generally linked to the size of the issue.

1999, subscriptions for these loans amounted to Rs.22,985

million compared to Rs.52,300 million in 1998. These loans

are sold at par and carry a fixed rate of interest which is

administratively determined, taking the trends in market

interest rates into consideration. As in the past, the

Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and the National Savings

Bank (NSB), which together accounted for 70 per cent of

total subscriptions, were the major subscribers to the Rupee

loan programme in 1999. The interest rates on these loans

were in the range of 12.00-12.50 per cent, while the

maturity periods were 2-years, 7-8 years and 9-10 years.

Unit Trusts

The total number of Unit Trusts (UTs) increased to 12 in

1999, with1 the commencement of operations of two new

UTs, Vanik Sashrika Index Fund and Vanik Sashrika

Income Fund, in May 1999. Although income funds

performed relatively well, a slight setback was seen in the

performance of the industry as a whole as the activities of

growth funds recorded a downturn.

The combined Net Asset Value (NAV) dropped by one per cent in 1999, in comparison to a decline of 13 per cent in 1998. The proportion of investments in equities declined by 5 per cent in 1999, compared to the 21 per cent drop recorded in, 1998. The number of unit holders and the number of units in issue also dropped marginally by one per cent each in 1999. Meanwhile, the NAV per unit declined from Rs. 6.77 in 1998 to Rs. 6.72 in 1999.

The combined NAV of growth funds dropped by 3 per cent in 1999, compared to the 19 per cent drop recorded in 1998. In contrast, the combined NAV of income funds moved up by 20 percent in 1999, compared to a three fold increase recorded in 1998. Correspondingly, the NAV per unit of growth funds, which was in the range Rs.5.18-9.14 in 1998, dropped to a range of Rs.4.82-8.50 (excluding Vanik Sashrika Index Fund) in 1999. This downturn in the NAV per unit in growth funds is mainly attributed to the decline in share prices in the stock market in 1999 as more

than 70 per cent of their total investment portfolio is in

shares. The All Share Price Index in the Colombo Stock

Exchange (CSE) declined by 4 per cent in 1999, in

comparison to a drop of 15 per cent in 1998. The NAV

per unit in income funds was approximately in a range of

Rs.10.60-11.20 in both 1998 and 1999. Out of the total

investment of income funds, 57 per cent was invested in

Treasury bills and 41 per cent in other fixed income

instruments, particularly in debentures, commercial paper

and asset backed notes, in 1999.

The maximum buying price per unit of growth funds

moved in a range of Rs.5.22-12.00, while that of income

fund was in a range of Rs. 10.27-11.22 during 1999. The

minimum selling price per unit of growth funds in 1999

was in a range of Rs.4.79-10.26, while for income funds

it remained within Rs.10.12-10.31. The total number of unit

holders of growth funds dropped by 2 per cent while the

units in issue also dropped by 1 per cent at end 1999. In

contrast, the total number of unit holders and the number

of units in issue of income funds moved up by 48 per cent

and 20 per cent, respectively, in 1999.

In response to the developments in the market, fund managers of growth funds have taken steps to diversify the investment portfolio with a view to minimising possible

losses to the unit holders. The share of investments in

equities, which was around 75 per cent of total investments

in 1998, has been reduced to around 71 per cent at end

1999,' while the share of investments in debt market

instruments such as- Treasury bills, debentures and

commercial paper has been increased from 25 per cent in

1998 to 28 per cent in 1999. Growth funds are not only

concerned about the changes in the overall investment

portfolio but also about the changes in the sectors of equity

investments, of these funds. Accordingly, the proportion of

equity investments in the banking, finance and insurance

and plantation sectors has been reduced, while increased

investments are seen in the diversified holdings, motors,

trading, hotels and travel and manufacturing sectors.

Given the downturn in the stock market, and the

usefulness of unit trusts, some measures are taken to

promote the activities of the industry. Accordingly, the

possibility of opening investments in Unit Trusts to non-

nationals, with some precautionary limits, was being

considered.
