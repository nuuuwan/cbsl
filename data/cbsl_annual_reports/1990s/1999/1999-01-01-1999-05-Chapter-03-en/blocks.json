In addition, the process could also be financed by the bank by extending a direct loan or providing an indirect facility. In the former case, a direct loan could be extended to the farmer to finance cultivation. Once the goods are delivered, the same process could be financed further by extending a loan to the buyer. The bank could help the parties involved by discounting an inland bill of exchange, iwhich is drawn by the;seller on the buyer and accepted by the buyer. On the due date, the bank which discounted the bill will forward it to the buyer for'payment. A further refinement to the operational process is the introduction of an internal letter of credit which could be opened by the buyer on the seller.",

Output in the high elevations, which declined by 9 per cent during 1998. improved by 7 per cent in 1999 to 81 million kg. Favourable weather conditions that prevailed in the hill country tea growing areas and improved agricultural practices and management contributed to this satisfactory performance. Output in the low elevation area declined by 1 per cent to 149 million kg. In spite of this drop in production, the low grown teas accounted for 52 percent of the total output.

This increasing trend continued till the end of year in the wake of a production shortfall in major producing countries such as India and Kenya and the active participation of Russia at the Colombo Auctions. Tea production in India and Kenya declined by about 100 million kg in 1999 owing to unfavourable weather conditions.

As a result, sesame production dropped by 16 per cent. Sesame oil has a very high demand locally, as it is free of cholesterol. Sesame also has a very high potential export market. The export market demands white sesame while the locally popular variety is black or the mixed seeds. Because of the cross-pollination in sesame, it is difficult to maintain pure white seeds, in areas where black sesame is also cultivated.",

    "text": "and Badulla districts. Total employed in the two factories and the nucleus estates is about 15,000 while another 30,000 families are involved in growing cane as smallholders. Despite these employment opportunities, domestic sugar production is adequate to meet less than 15 per cent of the total consumption requirement. The short fall in domestic supply was met from the import of 479 thousand metric tons during the year. The average international price of sugar dropped by 9 per cent to US dollars 222 per metric ton during the year. However, there was only a 12 per cent drop in the retail price of sugar in the local market. At present the local sugar industry is heavily protected by an import duty of Rs.3,500 per metric ton. Despite this protection, the financial viability of the sugar industry in Sri Lanka has been threatened by the high costs of production compared with that in other countries in the region. The high cost of production could be attributed to the poor sugar recovery rates and the high cost of overheads in the factories. The sugar recovery rates in India (over 10 per cent) are much higher than in Sri Lanka. Recovery rates are directly related to the sugar content in the cane and the processing efficiency. The sugar content in the local cane is low mainly due to poor field management. One of the biggest drawbacks to improving the quality of cane is the existing pricing mechanism for cane. At present, the payment for cane is based purely on the tonnage at Pelwatte. Though a quality based payment system for cane is available at Sevanagala, it does not identify the individual grower's cane quality as the payment is based on the overall seasonal average. There is no distinction between the cane with a high sugar content and a low sugar content at the time of purchase. Hence, the individual cane grower has no incentive to improve the quality of his cane through better field management.",

The off shore and deep-sea sector, which accounts for about one third of the total marine fish production, showed a significant improvement of 20 per cent over the previous year. This improvement is attributed to the increased assistance received by fisherman in the form of day and multi-day boats, traditional craft, outboard motors and fishing gear. Meanwhile, fish production in the coastal and the inland/ aquaculture sectors expanded by 3 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.",

This was mainly the result of a significant decline in the exports of prawns due to the outbreak of white spot and yellow head diseases, particularly in the Western and Northwestern provinces. Over crowding of the farms beyond the capacity of the water body of the Dutch canal and contravention of environmental regulations lead to the rapid spread of diseases. Consequently, several prawn farms were closed during the year. Prawn farming became a very lucrative business, which resulted in several unauthorised farms being established over the years. At present, there are over 1,300 farms, of which nearly half (48 per cent) are unauthorised.",
