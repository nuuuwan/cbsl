3.1 Production Trends

Agricultural output grew by 4.5 per cent in 1999 with major

sectors responding well to the very favourable weather

conditions throughout the year. Favourable weather helped

to increase the extent of cultivation under field crops and

production. Paddy production at 2.9 million metric tons, the

highest output ever, grew by 7 per cent in 1999, following the

20 per cent growth in 1998. Tea reached a new peak

production levelof 284 million kg from the peak level of

1998, recording a 1 per cent growth in 1999. However, tea

could not generate an increase in export earnings as a result

of low prices resulting from the Russian crisis. Tea prices

improved during the latter part of 1999 with the recovery in

Russia and a global decline in production caused by fall in

output in India and Kenya. Coconut output of 2,808 million

nuts, the highest production since 1986, recorded a 10 per cent

growth in. 1999. The lagged effects of the favourable weather

conditions that prevailed during the previous year, well

distributed rainfall in 1999 and increased application of

fertiliser contributed positively towards the enhanced coconut

output. Among other export crops coffee, cinnamon quills,

cloves, cardamoms, nutmeg and mace and citronella registered

higher output. Among other field crops, big onion output

increased threefold while potato and kurakkan production

increased by 5 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. Chillies,

black gram, sesame and green gram registered lower

production levels than in the previous year. Fish production

increased by 8 per cent during 1999. The production of poultry

and sugar also improved during the year.

3.2 Agricultural Policy

Agricultural policy continued to evolve broadly in the direction of gradual government withdrawal from the production of crops and seeds, liberalisation of extension services and insurance, while developing market based methods of enhancing farmer welfare and safety nets.

In line with the National Seed Policy of

commercialising the seed and planting material sector

announced in 1996, the Seed Act is being drafted and will

be presented to Parliament in the near future. The Seed Act

focuses on enhancing the production and marketing of high

quality seeds. Government has already initiated the duty free

import of seed and planting material. In order to develop

the production of quality seeds within the country, the

government granted Rs.100 million in 1999 to strengthen

seed production centres at Maha Illuppallama, Batalagoda,

Ambalantota, Bata-Ata and Nikaweratiya. The private sector

is expected to play an important role in the seed industry.

Government has privatised in 1998 the Hingurakgoda seed

farm owned by the Department of Agriculture (DOA) and

the preliminary work connected with the privatisation of the

Pelwehera seed farm was completed. The privatised seed

farm at Hingurakgoda is progressing well and positive results

are evident from the fact that there was no scarcity of seed

paddy during the last Maha season.

In order to enhance the scope of agricultural insurance

activities, a new act, the Agriculture and Agrarian Services

Act was enacted during the year. With the enactment of the

new act, the former Agricultural Insurance Board (AIB) was

reconstituted with a wider scope and was named the

Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board (AAIB). The new

act will permit private insurance companies to take up crop

insurance activities, which were a monopoly of the former

AIB.

Agricultural extension services, provided solely by the government as a free service, was subject to liberalisation in 1999. With a view to improving efficiency and to making agricultural extension activities competitive, a fee based private extension service was initiated as a pilot project during the year, under the Second Perennial Crop Development Project funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Privatisation of state owned plantation companies, which commenced in 1995, continued during the year. The remaining government owned shares of the Namunukula and Talawakelle plantations, amounting to 20 per cent each, were sold to the public through the Colombo Stock Exchange in

1999. In the long-term interests of the viability of the plantation sector the Golden Shareholder was expected to monitor closely the activities of the plantation companies.

In the context of unsuccessful guaranteed price schemes to alleviate problems faced by small farmers in securing a reasonable price, the Central Bank initiated a forward contract mechanism for agricultural produce under the 'Govi Sahanaya Scheme' in a few districts. Forward contracts allow

Box 2

Forward Sales Contracts for Agricultural Produce: Price Stablisation through the Market

Mechanism

A disturbing feature in the agricultural sector in many

countries has been wide fluctuations in prices of ; agricultural produce between the season and the off­

season. In season, prices fall sharply, usually below the

cost of production, making agricultural activities

unprofitable and unviable. In contrast, offseason, short

supply pushes prices up giving wrong signals-to farmers,

on the one hand, and raising the cost of living of the

consumers, on: the other. In Sri Lanka, the amplitude

of such price fluctuations between season and offseason

in major agricultural produce has been unusually high.

Greater ^stability of the prices of agricultural ;produce

. would sustain the farmer and ease the burden on the

consumer.

The conventional solution to this problem has taken two forms: the introduction of floor,price schemes and j the establishment of government marketing institutions. Though1'these measures have been effective in the very short:run in achieving their objectives, in the long-run, both strategies have proved to be self-defeating. This has be'enmainlydue to difficulties in maintaining a dual price system continuously and the inefficiency of government marketing boards in functioning as effective marketing institutions. It has become necessary to approach the problem through a system, which would be effective both in the shortgun and in the long-run. Many countries have achieved this by establishing forward sales contract systems for agricultural produce to guarantee an acceptable price for both the seller and the buyer in the market.

.A forward sale contract is a legally binding ^agreement between a buyer and a seller. By this; agreement, the.seller agrees to sell (and the buyer to buy) a .given quantity ..of agricultural produce.of a specified quality on a given future date at a pre-deterrnined" price. Such contracts amount to marketing arrangements in advance,': which would secure a confirmed order to the seller, on the one hand, and an. assured supply to the buyer, on the other. A system of that nature was" promoted by the Central Bank in 1999 under the promotional title of 'Govi-Sahanaya' (relief to the farmer). Although Sri Lanka has had such ."forward marketing arrangements for selected perennial crops; on an informal basis for a long time, the Govi Sahanaya was the first attempt to introduce a forward

contract system on a formal basis. The forward:contracts

derive their legal status from the Sale of-Goods

Ordinance,.enacted in 1896. In the system introduced

in Sri Lanka, in addition to the buyer and the seller, -

provision has been made for a bank tosparticipatesas a

facilitator of the contract; Hence, it can be called a

tripartite arrangement among the farmers, buyers and

the bank. A forward sale contract is purely a voluntary

action: *The three parties involved would enter into the,,

contract of their own accord. It is a system of stabilising

prices through the market.

The contract;helps the farmer by assuring actable price for his produce. The price can be fixed by a mark­up over the cost of production, thereby giving an assured net profit to the farmer, depending on market • conditions.. At the same time, it assures a guaranteed supply to the buyer at a given price, thereby helping him to pre-plan his procurement process and the cash flow properly. The role of the banker in the contract is simply to ^disseminate information on the cost of production and the time of availability of products; and; bring together potential buyers and sellers. For these services, the banker; is entitled to charge a commission from both the buyer and the seller. In addition, the process could also be financed by the bank by extending a direct loan or providing an indirect facility. In the former case, a direct loan could be extended to the farmer to finance cultivation. Once the goods are delivered, the same process could be financed further by extending a loan to the buyer. The bank could help the parties involved by discounting an inland bill of exchange, iwhich is drawn by the;seller on the buyer and accepted by the buyer. On the due date, the bank which discounted the bill will forward it to the buyer for'payment. A further refinement to the operational process is the introduction of an internal letter of credit which could be opened by the buyer on the seller.

v A schematic presentation of the operation of a

Forward Sale Contract System is given in the Chart.

In order to encourage the use of forward contracts by farmers and buyers of the agricultural produce, the government announced in its; Budget 2000. a waiver of the.stamp duty on Sale Contracts, Inland Bills of Exchange;and Internal Letters of Credit that may be generated to facilitate a Forward Sale Contract.

farmers and traders to enter into agreements for the purchase

of pre-determined quantities of produce at pre-determined

prices on a future date. Forward contracts facilitate farmers

to reduce fixed marketing risks and realise less unstable

prices. They will also benefit traders and consumers with

stable supplies and prices.

3.3 Export Crops

Tea

The upward trend in tea production since 1993 continued in 1999 and reached a new record level of 284 million kg. This was an increase of one per cent over the peak production of the preceding year. This improvement in production was entirely due to good performance reported from the high elevation areas. Output in the high elevations, which declined by 9 per cent during 1998. improved by 7 per cent in 1999 to 81 million kg. Favourable weather conditions that prevailed in the hill country tea growing areas and improved agricultural practices and management contributed to this satisfactory performance. Output in the low elevation area declined by 1 per cent to 149 million kg. In spite of this drop in production, the low grown teas accounted for 52 percent of the total output. Production in the medium elevation area declined by 1 per cent to 53 million kg.

Tea production in the smallholder sector declined by 1 per cent to 164 million kg in 1999 when compared to 1998. Majority of the smallholders who had neglected pruning their tea fields during the last few years resumed pruning during the first half of 1999. Poor prices also discouraged the application of fertiliser by smallholders, with a negative

impact on the average yield, which declined by 1 per cent

to 2,166 kg per hectare. However, resumed pruning will

improve productivity in the long run. The average yield in

the estate sector was 1,087 kg per hectare. The average

national yield was 1.514 kg per hectare.

The downward trend in tea prices recorded since September 1998 triggered off by the rouble crisis as well as the global over supply continued until June 1999. Tea prices, which remained depressed during the first half, recovered after July 1999 with the onset of the quality season. This increasing trend continued till the end of year in the wake of a production shortfall in major producing countries such as India and Kenya and the active participation of Russia at the Colombo Auctions. Tea production in India and Kenya declined by about 100 million kg in 1999 owing to unfavourable weather conditions. Despite a significant improvement in prices in the second half of the year, the annual average price of tea at the Colombo Tea Auctions was 14 per cent lower in 1999 than in 1998.

Export earnings of tea in 1999 declined by 15 per cent to Rs.43,700 million largely due to low export prices during the first half of the year. The average export price of tea declined by 12 per cent to Rs. 162 (US dollars 2.30) per kg from Rs. 185 (US dollars 2.88) per kg. The quantity of tea exported was slightly lower than in 1998. Five major buyers including Turkey. Syria and the UK purchased 51 per cent of total tea exports from Sri Lanka. The UAE and Russia bought 30 per cent of the total tea, each accounting for about 15 per cent.

Exports of 'value added tea' did not show a promising performance in 1999 in spite of the incentives provided to

promote value added tea production. The export share of

tea in packs and tea bags declined to 30 per cent and 4.2

per cent, respectively from 34 per cent and 4.4 per cent in

1998. The share of bulk tea exports, which stood at 49

per cent in 1995, increased gradually to 59 per cent in 1998

and 64 per cent in 1999. Value added products such as tea

bags, ready to serve cold tea and flavoured tea have good

potential for development in local and international markets.

curative aspects of tea should be used in the international

promotional campaigns of tea. Some private companies

initiated organic tea production to cater to markets in

Germany, France, and the UK. There was a growing demand

for organic tea in the world and India has planned to increase

the production of organic tea to cater to health conscious

consumers in the USA, Europe and Japan.

Tea imports for blending purposes amounted to 1.9

million kg in 1999, a decline of 56 per cent from 1998.

Total imports accounted for less than one per cent of

domestic tea production.

Most private tea factory owners faced financial

difficulties owing to the drop in prices of tea in the early

part of the year. As a relief measure, the Ministry of

Plantation Industries proposed a short-term loan scheme to

tea factory owners amounting to two months of working

capital. Loans up to Rs.7 million and repayable within two

years with a grace period of three months, at a concessionary

rate of interest were distributed through commercial banks.

The Sri Lanka Tea Board assisted the commercial banks to

determine the capacity of tea factories and the Treasury

provided a guarantee. At end December 1999, Rs.162 million

had been granted under that loan scheme.

The Tea Small Holder Development Authority

(TSHDA) continued to assist the tea industry by

implementing subsidy schemes for replanting and new

planting of tea, and providing advisory and extension

services. In addition, the TSHDA also continued programmes

for 1,153 Tea Small Holder Development Societies in which

the total membership amounted to 130,460 at end 1999.

TSHDA continued to implement in 1999 the 'Tea Shakthi'

scheme, which covers insurance, savings, and investment and

pension benefits for smallholders. Total membership at end

1999 was 100,924 while total savings and investment under

the scheme amounted to Rs.86 million and Rs.80 million

respectively. At end 1999, insurance benefits of Rs.14

million were paid to 438 beneficiaries under the Tea Shakthi

pension scheme. The 1998 budgetary allocation of Rs.200

million for the Tea Shakthi Investment Project was

completely utilised, for upgrading the transport network,

purchase of colour separators and establishment of tea

factories. There was a target to establish 21 tea factories in

selected locations for the benefit of small growers. Under

the 'Development Fund' programme, tea smallholders were

provided with credit facilities to purchase necessary inputs.

The maximum extent for replanting of tea for which a

subsidy could be received was limited to one acre per permit

holder under the tea replanting subsidy scheme implemented

by the TSHDA. In addition, a productivity improvement

programme was implemented in order to increase the average

yield per hectare up to 2,300 kg in the year 2000.

The TSHDA continued the implementation of the

Fertiliser Credit Scheme through Tea Development Societies.

35

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

The administration of the "scheme was handed over to the

TSHDA from the Tea Commissioner's Division in 1999.

During-the year 11,936 metric tons of fertiliser was supplied

under this scheme.

Rubber

Rubber production, which, has been declining since 1996,

recovered by 1 per cent to 97 million kg in 1999. Favourable

dry weather conditions that prevailed in rubber growing areas

made possible an increase in the number of tapping days.

The abolition of the cess in 1998 and the depreciation of

the currency helped smallholders to withstand the sharply

declining prices to some extent.

The annual average prices of RSS 1 and latex crepe

IX dropped by 10 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively,

compared to the previous year. However, there was an

improvement in prices at the Colombo Auctions during the

last quarter reflecting international market trends. The

average price of RSS 1 was Rs.52 per kg during the last

quarter of the year compared with the annual average price

of Rs.45 per kg. A similar trend in prices was witnessed in

the case of latex crepe IX where the average price during

the last quarter was Rs.61 per kg while the annual average

price was only Rs.52 per kg. In response to relatively poor

prices fetched for latex crepe and the RSS grades, processing

of rubber has shifted towards the manufacture of centrifuged

latex, increasing its share from 5 per cent in 1998 to 18 per

cent in 1999. •

Sri Lanka decided to withdraw from the International

Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) in 1999. Malaysia and

Thailand too have withdrawn from the agreement. This was

in response to the failure of the price stabilising arm of

INRA, the International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO)

to prevent the gradual deterioration of international rubber

prices, which affected all rubber producing countries

including Sri Lanka. As a. result of these withdrawals, the

INRA was terminated in 1999.

An improvement in the price of natural rubber is expected with increased demand from the USA, South Korea

and China. Further, the demand for natural rubber will

increase with the increase in synthetic rubber prices along

with rising petroleum prices.

Replanting of rubber, which has shown a declining trend

since 1996, continued further in 1999 due to the poor prices,

that prevailed during the year. In fact, some of the

smallholders are planting other crops in the uprooted rubber

lands adversely affecting replanting activity. The area under

new planting declined drastically by 58 per cent to 218 ha.

during the year.

The national average yield of rubber in Sri Lanka

(900kg/ha.) is far below the potential yield in the range of

1,500-2,000 kg/ha as estimated by the Rubber Research

Institute. Non-application of recommended levels of fertiliser

as well as the non-use of rain guards by a majority of rubber

growers had led to depressed yield levels.

Rubber is an important raw material in the rubber based

manufacturing industries. The domestic consumption of

rubber in the industrial sector, which has shown a steady increase over the last few years, continued in the same direction during 1999. Domestic consumption increased marginally to reach 54 million kg and accounted for 56 per cent of domestic rubber production. At present Sri Lanka is the world's largest industrial tyre manufacturer. However,

36

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

a shift towards the manufacture of quality pneumatic tyres

is desirable, as the value added in pneumatic tyres is higher

than in industrial tyres. Treated rubber wood is used in

several countries for the manufacture of high quality

furniture. There is high potential to expand the treated rubber

wood based furniture industry in Sri Lanka.

Coconut

Coconut production, estimated at 2,808 million nuts, recorded

a significant improvement of 10 per cent in 1999. This is

the highest output since 1986. The improvement in

production could be attributed to the increased use of

fertiliser, the lagged effect of the favourable weather

conditions that prevailed throughout 1998 and the well

distributed rainfall in the coconut growing areas during 1999.

With increased production, the output of all kernel products

except coconut oil increased during the year. The most

significant improvement was reported in the desiccated

coconut (DC) industry, which reported an almost 50 per cent

increase compared to the previous year. The production of

coconut cream and milk powder too showed a 35 per cent

increase compared to the previous year, while the export of

copra and fresh nuts improved by 41 per cent and 20 per

cent, respectively.

The price of DC remained attractive throughout the year

on account of global shortages. Output in Indonesia and

Philippines was hampered by the adverse impact of the El-

Nino and La - Nina climatic phenomena, which affected

these countries during the last two years. As a result, the

annual average price of DC at the Colombo Auction

improved by 23 per cent over the previous year. The

improved prices of DC helped to increase the output of DC

at the expense of coconut oil production.

The price of coconut oil, which remained attractive during the first1 half of 1999, commenced declining during the second half due to the availability of cheap substitute oils such as palm oil, as well as the recovery of the coconut .oil industry in the Philippines during the latter part of the year. The price of copra, which remained attractive at the beginning of the year, suffered a temporary setback during the later stages of the second and the third quarters due to the unstable.political situation in Pakistan, the major buyer of copra. The j annual average price of copra recorded a 15 per centimprovement over the price reported in the previous year.

The average export price (f.o.b) of the three kernel

products increased by 20 per cent to Rs.9.95 per nut. The

export earnings from kernel products increased by 64 per

cent in rupee terms and 52 per cent in US dollar terms. The

export earnings from non-kernel products increased by 27

per cent to Rs. 3,146 million.

The coconut development loan scheme (Kapruka Ayojana) implemented by the Coconut Cultivation Board

(CCB) in June 1998 was a significant departure from the

traditional cess assisted subsidy schemes. The scheme

introduced 11 categories of loans for coconut cultivation,

inter cropping, rehabilitation, irrigation, provision of farm

machinery, nurseries etc. The Kapruka Ayojana scheme will

assist the development of 25,000 acres of coconut lands over

a period of 5 years with an anticipated investment of

Rs.1,300 million. During the year, over 1,600 preliminary

applications were received from the farmers, of which 724

have been submitted to the participating credit institutions.

During the year 461 loans amounting to approximately Rs.50

million were granted under the programme. Coconut lands

replanted during the year increased by 17 per cent to 698

hectares, while the newly planted extent reported a marginal

increase to 660 hectares. During the year, the CCB

distributed over 780,000 plants for cultivation in homesteads.

The Coconut Research Institute (CRI) made a major

breakthrough to develop a few whole plants under a tissue

culture research programme. This technique could be used

in future to propagate high yielding seedlings for commercial

cultivation. A study carried out by the CRI revealed that

the yield gap between the potential and the actual output in

estates (less than 20 acres) has widened over the years. The

non-adoption or the incorrect adoption of the recommended

cultural practices is identified as the main cause contributing

to this increasing gap in yield. CRI is planning to organise

a training programme to educate the farm managers on all

aspects of coconut cultivation including recommended

cultural practices to arrest the widening yield gaps and to

improve the productivity of coconut lands.

Other Export Crops

The other agricultural exports sector has gained importance since 1990, recording earnings higher than rubber and coconut exports. In 1999, earnings from other export crops grew by 5 per cent and amounted to Rs.l 1,5.98 million. Traditionally, other export crops include spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, pepper, cardamoms, commodities such as coffee, cocoa, sesame seeds, cashew kernels and other agriculture products such as arecanuts, betel leaves and essential oils. Cinnamon is the single most important item in this category. Unmanufactured tobacco and pepper were other important items and these three items together contributed to 65 per cent of the earnings from the other export crops sector in 1999.

Among other export agricultural crops, cinnamon accounts for the largest extent under a single crop. Sri Lanka is the largest producer of cinnamon in the world and contributes about two thirds of the global production. About 90 per cent of the production is exported. Mexico is the major market for cinnamon. USA and Spain are the other

important markets. Sri Lanka also exports cinnamon oil to

USA, France, UK and India. Export earnings from cinnamon

quills and chips amounted to Rs.3,530 million, a 9 per cent

increase compared to the preceding year. In addition,

earnings from cinnamon oil exports amounted to Rs.l68

million. Farm gate prices of cinnamon quills were lower in

1999, while leaf oil prices were higher than in 1998.

In view of the higher international prices, cultivation of pepper has increased rapidly in recent years. However, production declined in 1999 owing to rainy weather conditions experienced during the flowering season. Consequently, there was a decline in the volume of exports. Export earnings from pepper declined by 24 per cent despite an increase in the average farm gate price by 10 per cent to Rs.300. Sri Lanka exports pepper and a small quantity of pepper oil mainly to India, Canada and USA.

According to estimates of the Department of Export Agriculture, production of cardamoms, cloves, coffee, nutmeg and mace increased in 1999. Farm gate prices of cloves, cardamoms and nutmeg and mace too increased significantly. The price of cloves improved significantly due to a global shortage owing to reduced production in Indonesia, the world's largest clove producer. With increased prices and export volumes, export earnings from cloves, nutmeg and mace increased by 194 per cent and 152 per cent, respectively.

Exports of cashew nuts declined markedly during the year. A drop in production owing to rain during the flowering period, as well as a significant rise in domestic consumption, led to a reduction in exports. The domestic price of cashew increased sharply in this tight supply situation. The new subsidy scheme initiated in 1997 for cultivation of cashew continued in 1999 as well. There were approximately 3,660 hectares in 13 districts selected under the subsidy programme. The rate of subsidy was Rs.8,645 per hectare and is disbursed over a period of 3 years.

Currently, Sri Lanka produces cinnamon leaf oil and

citronella oil in fairly large quantities and also exports small

quantities of other varieties of essentials oils from spices

such as pepper, nutmeg, mace, cardamoms, mustard and

cloves. These are high value-added products, which are

widely used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and perfumery

industries. The Export Development Board (EDB) assisted

producers of spices in organic farming and assisted exporters

to participate in trade fairs on essential oils and spices.

Commercial cultivation of foliage and cut flowers has

increased in recent years and exports of these have a good

potential as a source of foreign exchange. Major markets

for live foliage plants are Netherlands and Japan. Cut flowers

such as carnations, roses and anthuriums are exported to

Japan and the Middle East. Export earnings from foliage

and cut flowers amounted to Rs.573 million in 1999. The

EDB assisted the floriculture sector by providing field

training under test cultivation programmes to anthurium

growers and marketing assistance to exporters to participate

at exhibitions on floriculture held in France, Japan and UAE.

The EDB initiated a long-term rapid multiplication

programme for anthurium plants and aquatic plants with the

Royal Botanical Gardens at Peradeniya.

The land area under spices and citronella is estimated

to have increased by 1 per cent to 91,106 hectares in 1999.

From the newly planted extent of 1,252 hectares 78 per cent

was under pepper. Subsidies disbursed for this sector

amounted to Rs.53 million, while 64 per cent of the total

amount was disbursed for the cultivation of pepper.

The second Perennial Crop Development Project

(PCDP) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, which

commenced in September 1998 to assist commercialisation

of cultivation of perennial fruits, spices, flowers and foliage,

continued to assist cultivators and processors through a

scheme of financial and technical assistance. This project is

operational in 17 districts, excluding the Northern and

Eastern provinces. In 1999, the project has approved 320

loans to the value of Rs. 155 million through selected

commercial banks and Rs.105 million has been disbursed.

The majority of these loans have been approved for the

cultivation of fruits in the Gampaha and Kurunegala districts.

In addition, Rs.2.3 million has been spent on awareness

programmes under the project and Rs.5.4 million has been

utilised for perennial crop related research by the Council

for Agricultural Research Policy (CARP).

3.4 Domestic Agriculture

Paddy

Paddy production during the 1999 cultivation year improved by 7 per cent and reached a peak output level of 2.9 million metric tons (137 million bushels). This surpassed the previous best output level reported in 1995 by 2 per cent. While there was an improvement in the extents sown and

harvested, especially during the Yala season, the average yield also was higher on account of increased fertiliser application.

Paddy output during the 1998/99 Maha season declined

by 2 per cent to 1.7 million metric tons. Delays in the

onset of the North East monsoon rains resulted in a reduction

of the extents sown and harvested during the season. Areas

mainly affected were minor irrigated and rainfed areas.

Crop damage was reported from the North Central and the

Eastern provinces due to floods, which occurred during the

latter stages of the crop. Estimated crop loss due to flood

damages was in the region of 1.2 million bushels (25,000

metric tons).

Compared to the previous Maha season, the most

notable improvements were seen in the districts in the

Northern Province. Paddy output in the districts of Jaffna,

Mannar and Vavuniya indicated significant increases of 28

per cent, 32 per cent and 93 per cent respectively. Removal

of the restrictions on the transport of kerosene and fertiliser

to the Jaffna peninsula and certain districts in the Northern

province resulted in a recovery in agricultural activities in

the region. In addition to the increase in the extents

cultivated, some of these districts also reported significant

improvements in yields. Accordingly, paddy yields in the

districts of Vavuniya, Trincomalee and Jaffna rose by 30

per cent, 28 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively.

Meanwhile delays in monsoon rains had a negative effect

on paddy cultivation in the districts of Kurunegala,

Anuradhapura and the Mahaweli 'H' areas. Paddy output

in these areas declined by 16 per cent, 20 per cent and 15

per cent, respectively.

Paddy output during the 1999 Yala season recorded a 23 per cent improvement over the previous Yala output and reached 1.1 million metric tons. This was the best Yala output ever recorded and surpassed the previous best reported in 1984 by 6 per cent. This was achieved mainly on account of a 29 per cent increase in the extent harvested during the season. The paddy output in all districts, except Badulla, Ampara, Hambantota and Mannar were better

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

during the 1999 Yaia season compared to the previous Yala

season. For the sixth consecutive year, the Ampara district

recorded the highest Yala output and accounted for almost

one fifth of total Yala production. The three districts of

Ampara, Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala together accounted

for nearly half of the Yala output (47 per cent).

The increasing trend in annual average yields continued

for the third consecutive year and reached 3,672 kg per

hectare, an improvement of 1 per cent over the previous

best yield,reported during the 1998 cultivation year.

The average yield during the Maha season improved

by 2 per cent to 3,618 kg per hectare, while it declined by

1 per cent in the Yala season to 3,760 kg per hectare.

Although the overall yield in the Yala season indicated this

decline, yield levels in nearly two thirds of all paddy growing

districts had improved compared to the previous season.

During the Maha season too, the yield levels in the majority

of the districts were better than those in the previous Maha

season. The best average yield during both Maha and Yala

seasons was in Uda Walawe, with the Mahaweli 'H' area in

second place.

The 'yaya' demonstration programme organised by the

Extension Division of the Department of Agriculture

continued for the fourth consecutive year. During the year,

nearly 1700 'yaya' demonstrations for over 37,000 farmers

were conducted, compared with 668 demonstrations for

16,000 farmers in the previous year. The objective of this

demonstration programme is to introduce a package of

practices with new technologies to increase productivity.

These demonstration programmes have contributed

positively to the improvement in productivity. The yield

levels achieved by farmers involved in the demonstration

programmes have been, on average, over 20 to 30 per cent

higher than by other farmers. The package includes timely

cultivation, using quality seeds coupled with the application

of straw and green manure along with inorganic fertilisers.

The attractive prices, which prevailed for paddy

throughout the year, encouraged farmers to apply adequate

levels of fertilisers which had a positive impact on the yield

levels. Hence, fertiliser issues to the paddy sector increased

during both Maha and Yala seasons. The fertiliser issues

on a cultivation year basis increased by 23 per cent to 311

thousand metric tons.

Credit granted under the New Comprehensive Rural

Credit Scheme (NCRCS) to the paddy sector during the

1998/99 Maha season amounted to Rs.208 million, compared

with Rs.230 million, during the previous Maha season.

Credit granted during Yala 1999 remained at Rs.110 million.

Rice imports during the year amounted to 214,000

metric tons. Of the total imports, over two thirds were

imported during the months of November and December

during which period a partial reduction of duty on imported

rice was granted. The import duty on rice was reduced to

10 per cent.from 35 per cent for the period 23 October 1999

to 31 December 1999, with a view to help stabilise domestic

rice prices.

Other Field Crops

As in the previous year, the other field crops sector reported

a mixed performance during 1999. The output of both big

and red onions, soya beans, kurakkan and potatoes increased,

while the production of green gram, cowpea, black gram

and sesame declined.

The production of big onions showed the most

significant improvement, increasing more than three-fold to

62,700 metric tons. A three-fold increase in the extent

cultivated and a 9 per cent improvement in the yield were

the main factors contributing to this growth. The attractive

domestic prices that prevailed during 1998 on account of a

ban on exports by India prompted many farmers in the

Matale District and Mahaweli 'H' area to cultivate big onions

during the 1999 Yala season. The Mahaweli 'H' area and

the Matale District together accounted for 80 per cent of

the extent under big onion cultivation while the balance was

cultivated in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts.

As a result of a glut in production during the Yala season,

some farmers faced difficulties in marketing their product

and the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) had

to intervene and purchase big onions from the local market.

In keeping with the increased output, big onion imports

declined by 16 per cent to approximately 84,000 metric tons.

Potato production during the year increased by 5 per

cent from the very low level of production in the previous

year indicating that the' sector is gradually adjusting to

changed ground rules after the elimination of import

licensing requirements. Output increased purely on account

of an improvement in yield levels, in spite of a drop in the

extent cultivated. The extent under potato, which has been

declining since 1996 with the removal of the ban on imports,

declined by a further 7 per cent to 2,171 hectares by end

1999.

Kurakkan is gradually gaining popularity as a health food. The extent cultivated increased by 6 per cent for the second consecutive year and the output increased by 9 per cent in 1999. Sesame being a drought tolerant crop, the extent under this crop declined due to the well-distributed rainfall in the low country dry zone districts. As a result, sesame production dropped by 16 per cent. Sesame oil has a very high demand locally, as it is free of cholesterol. Sesame also has a very high potential export market. The export market demands white sesame while the locally popular variety is black or the mixed seeds. Because of the cross-pollination in sesame, it is difficult to maintain pure white seeds, in areas where black sesame is also cultivated.

Maize is a main ingredient in the provender industry and has a very high potential domestic demand. However, the extent cultivated and the output of maize declined by 3 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, in 1999. Maize is used as an important input in the preparation of poultry feed. Unlike most of the other agricultural products, there was no

tariff protection for maize. While this helps the poultry

industry, the local producers have been at a disadvantage.

Taking this into consideration, Budget 2000 introduced a 5

per cent import duty on maize. The quantity of maize

imported during the year amounted to approximately 128,000

metric tons indicating the high shortfall in domestic supply.

Vegetables and Fruits

The available preliminary estimates indicated a 6 per cent

increase in vegetable production during 1999. The total

volume has been estimated at 554,641 metric tons. Up

country vegetables such as cabbages, carrots, leeks, tomatoes

and beet are grown extensively in the Badulla and Nuwara

Eliya districts. Production of up country vegetables increased

by about 10 per cent, reflecting farmer preference to grow

more vegetables in place of potatoes. Accordingly, there

has been an increase in the extent under cultivation of

vegetables. Low country vegetables such as brinjals, ladies

fingers, bitter gourd, snake gourd and pumpkins are widely

grown in Hambantota, Matale, Ratnapura and Kurunegala

in both the Yala and Maha seasons. The production of low

country vegetables too increased by about 5 per cent. In

response to the increase in supply, vegetable prices during

the year 1999 were relatively lower and more stable than in

1998.

Vegetables are exported in fresh, semi processed and

processed forms to different markets such as the Middle East,

the Maldives and Europe. Among fresh vegetable exports,

the main items are leeks, capsicum and mixed vegetables.

Among processed vegetables, semi processed gherkins and

processed gherkins were the major items. Japan was the

major market for processed gherkins.

Cultivation of fruits in Sri Lanka is done in a non­commercial manner, except for pineapples and bananas. Pineapples are commercially grown throughout the year in the Gampaha and Kurunegala districts, while bananas are grown in the Hambantota and Ratnapura districts. Mangoes, rambutan, mangosteen and durian are seasonal fruits, which have good demand from domestic and foreign consumers.

Approximately 7,000 metric tons of fresh and dried fruit

including tamarind were exported in 1999. The export

earnings from these amounted to Rs.476 million. Pineapples

were the major export item while mangoes, papaw, avocado

and watermelon were exported in relatively small quantities

to the Middle East, the Maldives and Europe. Fruit juices,

jellies, jams, marmalades and other canned forms too were

exported to these markets. Some amounts of local fruits

are processed into jams, cordials, chutneys, ready to serve

drinks etc. to cater to the domestic market. There is a very

good potential to expand the processing of fruits and

vegetables for both domestic and export markets. However,

this has not been exploited due to insufficient infrastructure

facilities to store produce during the glut season, failure to

4 1

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri L a n k a A n n u a l Report - 1999

link producers and processors and poor marketing systems. The new liberalised environment, together with the incentive to develop a more forward formal market for agriculutral products under the 'Govi Sahanaya' introduced recently is expected to improve the marketing network and help the development of infrastructure facilities.

There was a significant increase in fruits imported to Sri Lanka and the quantity imported more than doubled during the last four years. During 1999, Sri Lanka imported nearly 40,000 metric tons of fruits worth one billion rupees, an increase of 43 per cent over the quantity imported in

1998. Apples, dates, grapes and oranges were the main varieties of fruits imported.

Sugar

Sugar production in 1999. at 65,220 metric tons, was 6 per cent higher than in 1998. As in the previous year, sugar was produced only at the Sevanagala and the Pelwatte factories. The Hingurana factory remained closed for the second consecutive year. The improvement in overall output was achieved solely on account of a 9 per cent improvement in output at the Pelwatte factory. This is the second best production level ever achieved at the Pelwatte factory since its commissioning in 1986. Meanwhile, production at the Sevanagala factory declined by 2 per cent during the year due to a reduction in the quantity of cane harvested.

The average yield at Pelwatte registered a further 27 per cent improvement to 56 metric tons per hectare during

1999. Yield improvements in Pelwatte are attributed to the favourable weather conditions during the year. The average yield at Sevanagala declined by 3 per cent to 79 metric tons per hectare. Yet the yield levels achieved at Sevanagala are

C h a r t 3.5

T o t a l Sugar A v a i l a b i l i t y

1990 1996 1997 1998 1999

still superior to that at Pelwatte because the fields at Sevanagala are irrigated while at Pelwatte. it is mainly rainfed cultivation.

The total quantity of cane crushed improved by 2 per cent to 745 thousand metric tons in 1999. The overall improvement was achieved purely on account of a 4 per cent increase in the quantity of cane crushed at Pelwatte. The quantity of cane crushed at Sevanagala declined by 3 per cent to 192 thousand metric tons in 1999 compared to the previous year. Almost half the cane crushed (49 per cent) at Pelwatte is accounted for by private purchases while at Sevanagala the private purchases account for about 1 per cent of the cane crushed. The sugar recovery rate at both Sevanagala and Pelwatte factories improved to 8.74 per cent compared to 8.37 in 1998.

The sugar industry provides employment opportunities for a large number of people in the Ampara, Moneragala

and Badulla districts. Total employed in the two factories and the nucleus estates is about 15,000 while another 30,000 families are involved in growing cane as smallholders. Despite these employment opportunities, domestic sugar production is adequate to meet less than 15 per cent of the total consumption requirement. The short fall in domestic supply was met from the import of 479 thousand metric tons during the year. The average international price of sugar dropped by 9 per cent to US dollars 222 per metric ton during the year. However, there was only a 12 per cent drop in the retail price of sugar in the local market. At present the local sugar industry is heavily protected by an import duty of Rs.3,500 per metric ton. Despite this protection, the financial viability of the sugar industry in Sri Lanka has been threatened by the high costs of production compared with that in other countries in the region. The high cost of production could be attributed to the poor sugar recovery rates and the high cost of overheads in the factories. The sugar recovery rates in India (over 10 per cent) are much higher than in Sri Lanka. Recovery rates are directly related to the sugar content in the cane and the processing efficiency. The sugar content in the local cane is low mainly due to poor field management. One of the biggest drawbacks to improving the quality of cane is the existing pricing mechanism for cane. At present, the payment for cane is based purely on the tonnage at Pelwatte. Though a quality based payment system for cane is available at Sevanagala, it does not identify the individual grower's cane quality as the payment is based on the overall seasonal average. There is no distinction between the cane with a high sugar content and a low sugar content at the time of purchase. Hence, the individual cane grower has no incentive to improve the quality of his cane through better field management.

3.5 Fish and Livestock

Fish

According to estimates provided by the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, the total fish production in the marine and inland sectors improved by 8 per cent to approximately 280 thousand metric tons. The off shore and deep-sea sector, which accounts for about one third of the total marine fish production, showed a significant improvement of 20 per cent over the previous year. This improvement is attributed to the increased assistance received by fisherman in the form of day and multi-day boats, traditional craft, outboard motors and fishing gear. Meanwhile, fish production in the coastal and the inland/ aquaculture sectors expanded by 3 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.

The fisheries sector plays a vital role in the economy of Sri Lanka, not only because nearly one million people depend on the fishing industry for their livelihood, but also because it helps to alleviate the problem of malnutrition in

the country. The country is rich with fisheries resources,

having a coast line of about 1,700 km. and an exclusive

economic zone (EEZ) extending to 200 km. from the coast,

covering an area of over 500,000 sq. km. Marine fishing

has been traditionally concentrated in the coastal areas, which

accounts for less than one eighth of the EEZ.

Though the country has a high potential to develop the

fishery industry, a large quantity of dry fish and canned fish

is imported into the country. The total imports of fishery

products during 1999 amounted Rs.3,933 million compared

with Rs.3,923 million in 1998.

With a view to harnessing the potential marine fishery

resources, the government has taken the initiative to

encourage deep-sea fishing. In this respect the promotion

of the use of multi-day boats with improved cold storage

facilities and the ability to stay longer at sea is contributing

to increased production. Under the producer subsidy scheme,

assistance has been granted for 56 multi-day boats and 233

day boats during the year as against 44 and 56, respectively,

in the previous year. Further, 459 traditional craft and 577

sets of fishing gear were also made available to fishermen

under the subsidy programme during the year. Investments

were also directed towards the development of infrastructure

facilities related to the fishery industry. Three new fisheries

harbours are being constructed at Kudawella, Hikkaduwa and

Panadura under the Fisheries Sector Development project,

funded by the ADB, in collaboration with the Ceylon

Fisheries Harbour Corporation. Meanwhile, the existing

harbours at Beruwala, Mirissa and Puranawella were

rehabilitated and provided with all essential shore facilities

and services.

The government, having identified the potential for developing the inland fisheries and aquaculture sector, established the National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA) on the 29 January 1999. The Authority is responsible for the management and development of aquaculture resources within the country. During the year, over 3 million fingerlings have been produced under aquaculture development and community based programmes and released to 80 rural tanks.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

The quantity and the value of fish and fishery product exports, however, declined by 14 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, during the year. This was mainly the result of a significant decline in the exports of prawns due to the outbreak of white spot and yellow head diseases, particularly in the Western and Northwestern provinces. Over crowding of the farms beyond the capacity of the water body of the Dutch canal and contravention of environmental regulations lead to the rapid spread of diseases. Consequently, several prawn farms were closed during the year. Prawn farming became a very lucrative business, which resulted in several unauthorised farms being established over the years. At present, there are over 1,300 farms, of which nearly half (48 per cent) are unauthorised.

Another sector with a high potential for expansion is the breeding and export of ornamental fresh water fish. Appropriate measures need to be taken to develop this industry as it has a high value addition component and provides considerable employment opportunities. During the year, the exports of ornamental fish amounted to Rs.559 million, an increase of 6 per cent over the previous year. The main markets for ornamental fish are Japan, USA, Germany and France. Sri Lanka's market share in the international ornamental fish market is less than 1 per cent. This is an indication of the potential for expansion in this industry.

The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development undertook four fisheries housing programmes for uplifting their living standards. About 20,000 housing units were constructed under the 'Diyawara Gamnana' housing programme, 'Diyawara Pura' housing scheme, 'Wisiri Nivasa' housing programme and the fisheries housing projects implemented with the collaboration of the National Housing Development Authority. Over 90,000 people have so far benefited from these programmes.

The Ministry also undertook several other development programmes during the year, which include the setting up of a Fishery Gene Bank at Negombo, establishment of a fisheries museum at Hambantota, the education of fishermen on satellite communication and the recruitment of 200 coast guards for coast conservation activities.

Livestock

The livestock sector consists mainly of the dairy and the poultry sub sectors. In the dairy sector both cow milk and buffalo milk production increased by 2 per cent each to 260 million liters and 82 million liters, respectively. Milk collection by the main processing companies namely, Kiriya Milk Industries of Lanka (Pvt.) Limited (KMILL), Nestle Lanka Limited (NLL), International Dairy Products Limited (IDPL) and other processors together amounted to 109 million litres indicating a 5 per cent reduction compared to the previous year. The main reason for the reduction in the collection of milk was the drop in collection by KMILL

due to an industrial dispute, which hampered its milk

collection programme. Of the total milk collection, KMILL

accounted for 43 per cent while NLL and IDPL accounted

for 26 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.

KMILL had formed over 400 'Farmers Managed

Societies' (FMS) by the end of the year to improve and

promote milk collection at the village level. Under this

system of milk collection, the quality of milk supplied by

individual farmers is tested separately on a daily basis, and

the payments are based on the fat percentage and SNF (solids

non fat) percentage. This has resulted in an improvement in

the quality of milk and an improvement in the incomes of

the individual dairy farmers who supplied milk direct to

KMILL rather than through a middleman.

At present, the country's milk supply is adequate to meet only about 20 to 25 per cent of the requirements. The balance is imported mostly in the form of powdered milk. During the year 54,000 metric tons of powdered milk were imported incurring an expenditure of Rs. 7,118 million.

The possibility of improving milk production by way

of upgrading the local cattle stock and improving veterinary

services should be looked into from the point of view of

enhancing the nutritional standards of the population.

According to the estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics, national egg production during the year rose by 3 per cent to 898 million eggs. A major problem faced by the small-scale poultry producers is the high cost of feed. The cost of production of an egg is estimated to have risen by about 7 per cent to Rs.3.50 per egg.

Poultry meat production has shown a steady increase in the recent past and is fast becoming a common source of animal protein in the diet of the people. According to the estimates of the Ministry of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure, poultry meat production during the year increased by 10 per cent to approximately 57,000 million kg. In the face of import competition, some uneconomical poultry farmers have abandoned poultry farming.

Livestock is an essential component of agricultural activities and should come within the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture. Having both crops and livestock within the same ministry will be conducive to better crop livestock integration.

3.6 Inputs and Credit

Fertiliser

The use of fertiliser increased by 9 per cent to 612,000 metric tons during 1999. The most notable increase in the use of fertiliser was in the paddy sector, which showed a 25 per cent improvement. Attractive prices for paddy, which prevailed throughout the year, and the favourable weather conditions which helped increase the area under cultivation, led to higher demand for fertiliser by farmers. Issues to the

4 4

Part 1 Central B a n k of Sri L a n k a A n n u a l Report - 1999

coconut sector also increased by 11 per cent due to the same

reasons.

Fertiliser application to tea, rubber, other field crops

and other export crops declined by 9 per cent, 31 per cent,

7 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively. In the case of tea

and rubber, the smallholders in particular reduced the

application of fertiliser in response to poor prices which

prevailed in the first half of the year.

Chart 3.6 Fertiliser Appplicalion-Major Crop Categories (1990=100)

The fertiliser subsidy, which has been confined to urea

only since 1997, continued during the year. The quality

control programme initiated by the National Fertiliser

Secretariat to check the adulteration of fertilisers in 1998

was continued during the year.

Seeds

High quality seeds are an important input to increase the productivity of agricultural crops. In this respect the proposed Seed Act will play an important role as it will give the Seed Certification Service legal authority to regulate the quality of locally produced and imported seed and planting material. The Act specifies minimum standards for seeds and planting material. The authority for implementation will be the Director General of Agriculture. Though seed certification is voluntary, minimum quality standards specified under the

Act will have to be maintained when marketing seeds and

planting material.

According to the National Seed Policy, the Department

of Agriculture (DOA) is entrusted with the responsibility of

producing and disseminating high quality basic seed to

private sector seed producers for multiplication purposes.

With the intention of providing low cost seed potato to

farmers, the DOA commenced a special seed potato

production programme using the Rapid Multiplication

Technique. The quantity of seed paddy issued by the

government and private sector organisations together

amounted to approximately 11,200 metric tons, a 2 per cent

increase compared to the previous year.

The issue of Other Field Crops (OFC) seeds, vegetable

seeds and potato seeds by the DOA increased by 25 per

cent, 38 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. Some private

companies produce and sell OFC and vegetable seeds.

Private sector seed importers dominate the import and

distribution of exotic vegetable seeds.

During the year, four new rice varieties bred at the Rice

Research and Development Institute at Batalagoda were

released to farmers for commercial cultivation. One of the

varieties is a 3 months variety while the other three are

3 months varieties. A new high yielding pole bean variety

named 'Keppetipola Nil' and a high yielding green gram

variety named 'Ari' were also released to the farmers during

the year.

Agro-chemicals

The use of agro chemicals became popular with the introduction of new high yielding varieties, which were susceptible to various pests and diseases. According to provisional estimates of the Pesticide Registrar the use of pesticides, which includes insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, increased by 13 per cent during the year. The quantity of insecticides used increased by 25 per cent, while fungicide sales increased by 32 per cent.

The Department of Agriculture is conducting an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programme with the aim of reducing the use of pesticides. During the year the Department conducted 235 field days. Over 4,500 paddy farmers have been trained under this programme. It is important to conduct IPM programmes for vegetables as well, since very high doses of pesticides are applied on certain intensively cultivated vegetables.

Credit

Cultivation loans granted under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) by the Regional Development Banks, the two state banks and the domestic private banks continued in 1999. Under the NCRCS, loans to farmers are granted at an interest rate of 12 per cent, from funds available with the Participating Credit Institutions. The

45

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

government gives an interest subsidy of 10 percentage points

to the banks.

The total amount of credit granted during the 1998/99-

cultivation year declined by 1 per! cent to Rs. 463 million.

Of the total loans granted, the Maha season accounted for

61 per cent and the Yala season for the balance. As in the

previous year, the major share of the loans was obtained by

paddy farmers who accounted for two thirds of the loans

(Rs.318 million). Even though the extent under paddy during

the Yala season increased by over 26 per cent over the

previous Yala season, the credit granted for paddy increased

marginally. Loans to the subsidiary food crops sector during

the year amounted to Rs. 145 million.

The two state banks continued to dominate the loans

granted under the NCRCS and accounted for nearly 60 per

cent of the total loans granted. About 25,000 farmers have

benefited under the NCRCS during the year. However, this

is only a small fraction of the credit needs of the farming

population. A large percentage of the farmers still depend

on informal sources for their credit needs.

3.7 Forestry

The Forest Department (FD), with the assistance of foreign

donor agencies, carried out several projects for forestry

related activities with special emphasis on the conservation

of forests and environment management. With the initiative

of the FD, the ADB completed the preparation of project

proposals for the five year implementation programme of

the Forestry Sector Master Plan, viz. the Forest Resource

Management Project (FRMP), and a memorandum of

understanding was signed. A loan of up to US dollar 30

million will be available for 7 years starting from the year

2000 for the above project.

ADB. and Australian Aid (Aus-aid) provided funds worth Rs 99 million and Rs 71 million, respectively, for the implementation of the Participatory Forestry Project during the year 1999. Under this project, 11 million seedlings were produced and forest plantations were raised through homestead development (4,948 hectares), farmers wood lots (2,566 hectares), protective wood! lots (740 hectares) and miscellaneous tree planting programmes (482 hectares) during 1999. Under forestry extension, 1.2 million seedlings

were raised and 4,765 kg of seeds were collected. The FD

completed silviculture treatment in 3,699 hectares, surveys

in 1,430 hectares and post felling inventory in 1,973 hectares

under forest inventory management during 1999.

The FD continued the Sinharaja and Knuckles

Conservation Project and the Mangrove Conservation Project

in 1999 under the Environment Management Project.

Conservation area management, buffer zone management,

extension and awareness programmes, training programmes,

maintenance of buildings, construction and maintenance of

roads were the activities carried out under the above projects.

The FD received funds from the World Bank and Global

Environmental Fund (GEF) for forestry related activities

under the Medicinal Plant Conservation Project. Medicinal

plant conservation activities were implemented in the Matale,

Ratnapura, Galle, Anuradhapura and Moneragala districts.

The volume of illicitly felled timber increased by 12 per cent to 2,912 cubic meters. However, the recorded number of forest offences declined by 6 per cent to 3,928 during 1999. The FD continued the monitoring of regulations relating to the transportation of timber and surveillance checks to restrict illegal deforestation.

Box 3 Deregulation of Agricultural Insurance in Sri Lanka

The Agricultural Insurance Board (AIB) was established

in 1973 to extend'comprehensive insurance coverage

. for paddy and subsidiary food crop cultivation and

' livestock farming in the country. As the insurance

business was a monopoly of the government at that time

under the Agricultural Insurance Law (AIL), the AIB

was given the monopoly power of providing agricultural

insurance in respect of paddy cultivation by making it

mandatory for. a farmer engaged in paddy cultivation

to obtain insurance cover from the AIB. With regard

to other crops and livestock farming, farmers were

permitted to obtain insurance cover on a voluntary basis.

Over the years, the AIB provided insurance cover

for paddy cultivation but since the premia collected was

not sufficient; to meet the indemnity payments, a

substantial sum of money had to be provided by the

Treasury to the.AIB-to meet the deficit: This shortage

of funds restricted, to a large extent, the expansion of

services of the AIB. Consequently, when the payment

of indemnities [was decided; the AIB was forced to

match the payments with the resources available,

; thereby making- the insurance coverage inadequate for

the insured farmers to meet their actual crop losses.

In the early 1980s, the general insurance business in Sri Lanka was- opened to private sector insurance companies. However, along with this liberalisation, no matching liberalisation was effected.in the agricultural insurance sector..As a result, the AIB continued to enjoy its monopoly power with respect to paddy cultivation. Even though the other subsidiary crops and livestock farming sectors did not have such restrictions, the low volume of business did not attract private insurance companies for agricultural insurance. It has been reported that only one private company, which started a limited insurance scheme in selected areas, has entered the field since the opening up of agricultural insurance to the private sector.

As agricultural insurance for paddy cultivation can be provided only by the AIB, lending banks are required to accept only AIB insurance policies as collateral for loans granted for paddy cultivation under officially sponsored loan schemes. In respect of loans for other crops and livestock farming there is no such restriction.;;

However, as private insurance companies have not

entered the field, there have been no opportunities for

lending banks to accept such policiessas collateral for

loans. ;

In order to establish a viable and sustainable crop

insurance sector in the country, it is necessary to

promote competition among different insurance

companies which will give the farmers a wider choice

of insurance policies. It is, therefore,* necessary .to

remove this monopoly power vested with the AIB in

respect of crop insurance for paddy cultivation. . ,

Having recognised the recommendations made by

the relevant authorities, the government took measures

to repeal the AIB Act and enacted new legislation in

the form of 'The Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance

Act No.20 of 1999' with a view to achieving the

following objectives.

(a) To broaden the scope of the AIB and establish

an Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board

(AAIB) to provide insurance for agricultural

and horticultural crops and medicinal plants,

livestock, fisheries and forestry, agricultural

equipment and implements, the storage and

preservation of agricultural and horticultural

• produce and products of medicinal plants,

^ fisheries and forest produce.

(b) To provide medical benefits and social,

security schemes for agriculturists; and

(c) To repeal the Agricultural Insurance Law

No.27 of 1973, thereby permitting private

insurers to undertake crop insurance.

With the implementation of the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Act from 16 August 1999, the activities hitherto handled by the Agricultural Insurance Board (AIB) were transferred to the newly established Agricultural and'Agrarian Insurance Board (AAIB). Since the monopoly of the AIB in respect of agricultural insurance was eliminated by the new Act, other insurance companies involved in the sector have the opportunity to enter agricultural insurance.

Farmers are now able to obtain agricultural

insurance from an insurer of them choice, -v
