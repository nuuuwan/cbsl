During 1999, malaria spread in the North Eastern and North Central provinces. The number of positive malaria cases reported in 1999 increased by 25 per cent to 265,401. However, the number of deaths due to malaria decreased by 13 to 102 in 1999. Several measures were taken to bring the situation under control. These included conducting mobile clinics, spraying chemicals against mosquito breeding and health education programmes. The health authorities expect to reduce the incidence of malaria substantially under the Roll Back Malaria Campaign (RBMC) with assistance from the World Health Organisation (WHO). An outbreak of measles was also reported in 1999. The out-break was brought under control mainly through public awareness programmes and by encouraging people to obtain the second dose of vaccine against measles. Moreover, with the objective of eradicating polio by the year 2000, a National Immunisation Day was held in 1999 for the fifth consecutive year. In order to facilitate public health education programmes in the provinces, a new Health Education Mobile Van Service, with necessary audio and video facilities, was introduced in all districts in 1999. Further, the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine conducted 2 Suwa Udana programmes with the participation of health specialists under which preventive and curative health services were provided in under-served areas. Action was initiated to control the consumption of alcohol, drugs and tobacco under the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco.",

Further, computer education is also being strengthened in schools and steps were taken to establish sophisticated Computer Education Centres on a regional basis. The shortage of teaching materials and educational equipment due to resource constraints hindered the efficient implementation of reforms. At the same time, the utilisation of foreign funds was not at a satisfactory level. Delays and other shortcomings in the administration procedures also slowed down the implementation of reforms. Despite these shortcomings, the overall response to the general education reforms was satisfactory. In the higher education sector, the Wayamba University was established in 1999. The progress of university education reforms has been slow as there was much diversity in the responses to the proposals for university education reforms. The implementation of tertiary education reforms, based on the recommendations made by the Presidential Task Force on technical education and vocational training, was continued in 1999.",

The balance will be trained at Teachers Colleges and the backlog of untrained teachers is expected to be cleared by 2002. Further, a policy decision has been made not to recruit untrained teachers thereafter. The necessary training for new teachers will be provided in the National Colleges of Education. A comprehensive teacher re-training programme is to be implemented by setting up 84 Teacher Centres (TCs), of which 72 TCs had been set up by end 1999. The required funds for the teacher training programme were provided by the World Bank under the Teacher Education and Teacher Deployment project. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Education (NIE) conducted a number of courses for training teachers. A total of 30,704 teachers, in service advisers, principals and educational managers participated in these courses during 1999.",

Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and Economic Development Co-operation Fund (EDCF) of Korea. The Regional Telecommunications Development Project I (RTDP I) was in progress to provide new connections and connect 15 Secondary Switching Centres (SSC) with an optical fiber ring in Kandy, Matale, Kalutara and Hatton areas. The cost of the project has been estimated at Rs.3,466 million. The Telecommunications Network Expansion Project I (TNEP I) was also in progress to develop the telecommunications infrastructure in the Colombo metropolitan area. The estimated investment for this project is Rs.5,920 million. The '150,000 Line Telecommunications Development Project' (150K project), which is being implemented by Sri Lanka Telecommunication Services Ltd. (SLTS), a subsidiary of SLT, continued in 1999. The 150K project is aimed at improving the telecommunications infrastructure in townships and rural areas covering almost all the provinces. The project was commenced in 1996. and by end 1999, about 220,535 exchange lines and 296,735 main cable pairs have been added to the network. During 1999. a total of 30 exchanges with a total capacity of 127.161 lines were commissioned. In addition, the traffic carrying capacity of the network too has been augmented to cater to the expanding market.",

    "text": "The total revenue of the; SLT increased by 9 per cent to Rs. 18,574 million in 1999. The growth in revenue is largely attributable to the increase in the number of connections given during the year and to the upward revision of the telephone tariff with effect from June 1999. The main objective of the tariff revision was to rationalise the domestic and international call charges. Accordingly, international call charges were reduced by about 8 per cent, while domestic call charges were raised from Rs.1.65 per unit to Rs.2.25 per unit, but applicable only to those who consume more than 500 units per month. However, domestic telephone charges applicable for calls during the discount period were significantly reduced to as low as 12 cents per minute, particularly for the benefit of Internet users. Meanwhile, the operating cost of SLT rose by 8 per cent to Rs. 13,825 million. With these developments, the operating profit of SLT increased by 7 per cent to Rs.",

First, in view of the high thermal power generation by the CEB, fuel costs expanded by 26 per cent to Rs. 3,554 million in 1999. However, CEB was able to contain fuel costs as it received diesel from the CPC at duty exempted prices. Second, with increased power purchases from the IPPs, power purchasing costs of CEB increased by 33 per cent to Rs.3,297 million in 1999. Consequently, the average purchasing price of electricity rose from Rs. 6.00 per unit to Rs.6.28 per unit between the two years. Third, in respect of hydro - power generated by the private sector, the purchasing price was relatively high at Rs. 3.22 per unit in the dry season (February - April) and at Rs. 2.74 per unit in the wet season. With these developments, the average cost of electricity to the CEB rose to Rs. 4.05 per unit in 1999",

Commuters continue to complain that the private operators are exceptionally profit motivated and do not consider the comfort of passengers. However, private bus operators indicate various sector specific difficulties that they face. The high cost of spare parts, the Goods and Services Tax and exchange rate variations are said to be the main reasons for the relatively high expenses. The issue of commuter comfort has been resolved to some extent with the introduction of luxury and semi luxury buses. The rapid increase in the number of luxury and semi-luxury buses indicate that passengers are willing to pay a higher price for a relatively more comfortable bus ride. However, there are growing concerns regarding the safety of the luxury services due to the increasing number of accidents. The normal service has not been able to overcome its difficulties",

Therefore, the government in its budget for 2000 proposed to liberalise the bunkering trade by opening it to the private sector. Accordingly, private operators will be allowed to supply bunkers to ships on an offshore basis. The government is also planning to set up a new Maritime Authority by amalgamating existing bodies and streamlining the regulations to oversee the ports and shipping industry.",

According to some preliminary estimates, the number of newly constructed houses and number of housing loans granted under various public and private sector housing programmes totalled to nearly 80,000 during 1999. A large proportion of these housing units were located in the rural and estate sectors. The demand for housing, especially in the urban sector, is growing rapidly along with the population expansion, urbanisation and rising income levels. Public sector housing programmes mainly focus on meeting the housing needs of the low and middle income families, while private sector housing programmes are largely for the middle and high income categories. The government strategy towards housing development encompasses rendering direct assistance to low income families to build or upgrade their housing, revitalising the housing finance system and encouraging the private sector to undertake housing development projects with appropriate incentives.",

In contrast, the population density in the whole country was 292 persons per sq. km. The limited housing supplyhas led to the spread of slums and shanties all over the city on vacant public lards. There were about 1,500 under served settlements in the Colombo City with 66,000 households in which about 51 per cent of the city's population lived. These settlements are spread over a land area of 963 acres occupying 11 per cent of the total land area of the Colombo City, which could otherwise be used for commercial, industrial and property,, development purposes. People living in these settlements have never had the legal right to their dwellings and could not find better shelter.
