As reflected in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator, the rate of increase in the overall price level declined to 4.4 per cent in 1999 from 8.4 per cent in the previous year. Prices declined at a faster rate than anticipated at the beginning of the year. This was due to improved domestic food supplies, containment of monetary expansion to below 15 per cent, lower import prices of food commodities and the moderation of the cascading effects in indirect taxation following the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST). Significantly higher positive real interest rates also reduced demand pressure to some extent.",

The reduction of the fiscal deficit in 1999 came mainly through the containment of non-interest expenditure, including security expenditure, while maintaining investment expenditure close to last year's level. The security expenditures declined from 5.7 per cent of GDP to 4.9 per cent of GDP. There was also a marginal improvement in the revenue buoyancy of the tax system after indicating a declining trend in the last few years. This was attributed to the measures put in place to improve tax administration, particularly to stop the leakage of GST revenues through refunds. As the availability of net foreign resources was lower than in 1998, a larger portion of the deficit was financed through domestic sources, mainly through bank borrowings.",

The overnight reverse repurchase rate was also reduced from 15 per cent at end 1998 to 13.48 per cent at end 1999 in line with market trends. The Central Bank purchased Treasury bills in the primary market to meet the increased demand for liquidity towards the end of the year on account of Y2K related uncertainty. Although currency in circulation increased by a maximum of Rs. 9,000 million in December, the increase was less than originally anticipated as the market had confidence in the country's preparedness for the changeover. The Bank absorbed the additional liquidity through open market operations when the financial market conditions returned to normal in January 2000. The broad money supply increased by 13.4 per cent in 1999. This was within the range of 13-15 per cent envisaged in the financial programme prepared at the beginning of the year.",

    "text": "view to further promoting financial system stability. While the regular on-site supervision of individual banks was intensified, quarterly off-site supervision was developed as an early warning system. The banks have been informed of the desirability of improving their disclosure standards and maintaining capital adequacy ratios at 10 per cent even above the level of 8 per cent recommended under the Basle guidelines, from the beginning of 2001. Steps are being taken to improve provisioning for non-performing loans from 6 months to 3 months. Auditors of banks have been given instructions regarding the specific aspects on which they should report. While some slowing down of private sector credit growth in 1999 could be attributed to this enhanced emphasis on prudential norms, the anticipated improvement in credit culture is expected to improve the stability and soundness of the banking system. Regular monthly meetings with banks and financial institutions have also helped to solve problems and improve practices.",

Interest rates indicated lower volatility with a slight decline in most interest rates, including yields on medium-term government bonds. The reduction of interest rates was in the range of 1-2 percentage points. While there was some pressure on the exchange rate during the first half of the year, it eased during the second half as the rate of inflation continued to decline. Real interest rates became more attractive for savers and investors in financial instruments. Meanwhile, there was build up of net foreign assets of commercial banks. The annual average depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar was 8.2 per cent in 1999, while the depreciation from end December 1998 to end December 1999 was 6 per cent. This behaviour of the exchange rate reflected the somewhat weaker balance of payments position in 1999.",

Although this growth rate was lower than the long-run annual average growth rate of around 5 per cent, it was a satisfactory rate given the difficult environment in which the country had to manage its affairs. An acceleration of the quarterly economic growth rates was clearly seen during the year. This was reflected in all major sectors. The fourth quarter results showed an impressive growth rate of 6.9 per cent and the indications are that this growth momentum has continued into 2000, particularly in the case of industrial and trading activities. This high growth rate was achieved largely by a further improvement in productivity in the manufacturing as well as services",

The Agriculture sector has tended to move from subsistence production to high value-added products based on improved technology and rational cultivation practices. This process will lead to commercialisation of agriculture and the development of agro-processing and agro-business activities. Further, with a view to improving the marketing network and assisting the small farmers, a forward market mechanism was initiated by the Central Bank during the year. Under this mechanism named the 'Govi Sahanaya', farmers are encouraged to enter into forward contracts with buyers at pre-determined remunerative prices. This scheme is expected to reduce the volatility of farmer incomes and to promote agro-business and agro-processing enterprises. In",

Therefore, while the private sector is called upon to play a vital role, given our stage of development, the public sector would also need to play a major role in infrastructure devlopment in areas where private sector participation is not forthcoming. Public sector leadership is essential in large infrastructure projects such as roads, railroads, dams, water supply and port development. Along with rapid improvement in economic infrastructure, investment in human resources has also become a pressing need to improve labour productivity. In this respect, education and health sector reforms are being implemented. The current strategy for improving the availability and quality of infrastructure includes construction of new infrastructure, rehabilitation and modification of existing facilities, institutional and management reforms and privatisation.",

The installed capacity of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was augmented by 3 per cent with the commissioning of a 40 MW thermal power plant at Sapugaskanda. The reliance on hydropower in 1999 remained at 67 per cent of total power generation. Improvement in the passenger transport sector was only moderate. Public and private sector bus fleets have expanded slightly. Further consolidation of public sector passenger transportation was under consideration to improve operational efficiency. Steps have been taken to augment the rolling stock of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR). However, more fundamental reforms of the SLR appears to be necessary to reduce its large operational losses and to improve the service. The operating loss of the SLR increased further to Rs. 1,848 million in 1999 from Rs. 1,066 million in 1998. Meanhile, fares have not been revised since 1996. With regard to road transport, the construction of the proposed expressways is expected to ease traffic congestion and improve access to regions. Several projects were underway to expand the capacity of the Port of Colombo. However, demand for port services has been almost stagnant during last two years, mainly due to competition from regional ports. In an analysis of port efficiency, the problem of staffing in the Port of Colombo would need to be examined. Further, as there could be competition between the SAGT and the rest of the port in the future, there is a need to appoint a regulator for the industry.",

The increased investment was financed through higher national savings and increased foreign savings, reflected mainly in higher private capital inflows. The gross national savings ratio increased from 23.4 per cent of GDP in 1998 to 23.9 per cent in 1999, while the gross domestic savings ratio, i.e. savings excluding overseas employee remittances increased, to 19.8 per cent of GDP.

These two indices as well as the Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index (GCPI). showed substantial deceleration in the increase in consumer prices. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) reflected a decline of 0.3 per cent in 1999. The rate of increase in food prices in the CDCPI decelerated sharply from 8.9 per cent in 1998 to 2.4 per cent in 1999, owing to improved domestic supply of rice, vegetables, coconuts and fish and improved marketing, as well as increased availability of imported food.",

Financial markets in emerging economies displayed a return to stability with the gradual build up of investor confidence stemming from firm implementation of reforms in domestic markets. Although the risk of a global recession appears to have receded, market conditions point to the continuation of economic slowdown in many regions, particularly in Japan, Europe, Russia and most developing countries. The sharp increase in oil prices, particularly since August 1999, could have serious adverse implications on the world economy, particularly on oil-importing countries.",

The ASEAN-4, (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand), which suffered the brunt of the currency turmoil with a contraction of 9.5 per cent in output in 1998, recovered with an estimated growth of 2.5 per cent.

Increased rice production reduced international prices of rice by 8 per.cent, while fertiliser prices declined by 3 per cent in 1999. Meanwhile, despite a drop in production as a result of weather related setbacks to production in Kenya, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia, tea prices declined by about 4 per cent in 1999 due to surpluses carried over from the previous year and a fall in demand from Russia, due both to falling real income levels and foreign exchange payment restrictions. International prices of tea indicated some improvement after July, but remained lower than in the previous year. The declining trend in rubber prices continued with a decline of about 8 per cent in 1999. Rubber prices reflected some improvement towards the end of the year due to improved demand and disruption to supply. Meanwhile, adverse weather affected coconut production in the two largest coconut exporting countries, the Philippines and Indonesia. As a result, coconut prices registered an improvement of 12 per cent in 1999. In",

The G-24 made a critical evaluation of the world economy following the unprecedented crisis in financial markets and called for, among other things, an international lender of last resort, more frequent use of SDRs to supplement international liquidity, a cautious approach to capital account liberalisation and a more co-ordinated approach by industrial countries in their macroeconomic management to reduce excessive volatility of exchange rates among key currencies. It stressed the need to keep developed country markets open for developing country exports. Developing countries also emphasised the need for an equitable burden sharing of costs adjustment and private sector involvement in forestalling and resolving financial crisis.",

Consequently, the deficit in the current account widened from US dollars 226 million in 1998 to US dollars 495 million in 1999. The current account deficit in the balance of payments as a ratio of GDP increased from 1.4 per cent in 1998 to 3.1 per cent in 1999. Gross private long-term capital inflows recovered significantly. However, there was a decline in long-term capital flows to the government. Total gross long-term capital inflows were much higher than in the previous year. Altogether, the overall balance of payments registered a deficit of US dollars 263 million in 1999.",

    "text": "The instability displayed in financial markets since late 1997 continued into the first half of 1998, as a consequence of the uncertainties generated by the global financial crisis. However, a significant degree of stability was achieved by the second half of 1998, and this stability was maintained into 1999. With the exception of a short period in April, when market uncertainty increased and interest rates fluctuated considerably as a result of elections and labour unrest, both the call market and the exchange market exhibited considerable stability because of better co\u00adordination between interest rate and exchange rate policies. Even in December, when general elections and the Year 2000 uncertainties created the potential for market instability, the markets remained relatively stable. This stability and the continuous decline in inflation enabled the Central Bank to relax its monetary stance continuously in the second half of the year, when the statutory reserve requirement (SRR) was reduced by 1 percentage point, from 12 to 11 per cent, in August. The Bank Rate was also reduced, by one percentage point, to 16 per cent. The additional liquidity the market received through the relaxation of the SRR served primarily to offset the drain of liquidity caused by the outflow in the balance of payments and any excess liquidity was mopped up through open market operations. This helped to avert a re-emergence of inflationary pressure or instability in the foreign exchange market. Open market operations continued to be the major tool for implementing monetary policy and the",
