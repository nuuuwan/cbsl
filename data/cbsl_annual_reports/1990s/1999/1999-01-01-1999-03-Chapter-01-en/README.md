Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

1. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, POLICIES AND ISSUES

1.1 Overview

Sri Lanka registered a moderate economic growth rate of

4.3 per cent in 1999. Economic activities, particularly in the

industrial sector, gradually regained their growth momentum

after experiencing a difficult period in the wake of the

recent global economic crisis. The world economy was on

a path towards steady recovery. The intensity of the recent

global economic turmoil was contained by strong but

painful adjustment efforts by crisis hit countries, the active

role played by international organisations and regional banks

in managing the crisis and assisting the crisis hit countries

in their adjustment efforts, the strong economic growth of

the United States and the continuation of robust economic

growth in the European Union.

The recent experiences in East Asia and Latin America

reveal that rapid shifts in market psychology from extreme

optimism to extreme pessimism can create financial market

turmoil. The experiences also showed that there are more

fundamental; factors leading to financial market crises. They

include inconsistent monetary, fiscal and exchange rate

policies, weak regulatory and supervisory standards,

premature liberalisation of financial markets, lack of

transparency in financial policies, weak corporate

governance and weaknesses in the international monetary

and financial system, including the absence of an

international lender of last resort with sufficient financial

resources to meet crises. Increased attention is now being

paid to addressing most of these problems both by the

countries themselves and international organisations.

World trade and output recovered significantly in 1999.

World output is estimated to have grown by 3.3 per cent

in 1999 compared with 2.5 per cent in 1998. The gross

domestic product of developing countries has grown by 3.8

per cent compared with 3.2 per cent in 1998. The crisis hit

East Asian economies too were recovering faster than

earlier expected, except for Indonesia, which had to contend

with a multiplicity of other internal problems. While capital

flows to higher-rated emerging market economies have

started to recover cautiously from their very low levels in

the previous two years, the flows to many other developing

countries failed to show any promising signs of recovery.

Non-oil commodity prices remained depressed in 1999.

Combined with a 40 per cent increase in crude oil prices

during the year, this has led to a sharp deterioration in the

terms of trade of oil importing developing countries. The

US Federal Reserve Board increased interest rates three

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

times during 1999 to avoid a possible overheating of the US economy due to concerns that the recent high rates of economic growth were not underpinned by a structural or sustainable growth in productivity. Several other industrial countries also raised interest rates in 1999. Although the successful introduction of the euro in 1999 reduced the number of major currencies that countries have to deal with in managing their exchange rates, international exchange market conditions remained highly uncertain, particularly with the euro losing its value sharply against the US dollar and the yen/US dollar rate showing high volatility. Amidst these complexities, the faster recovery of the global economy provided some relief to developing countries including Sri Lanka.

With its improved macroeconomic policy co-ordination, the Sri Lankan economy benefited from the recovery of external demand. Sri Lanka's economic growth rate of 4.3 per cent in 1999 was higher than the developing country average growth rate of 3.3 per cent. After a slow growth of 3 per cent during the first quarter, Sri Lanka's economic performance gathered momentum to reach a growth rate of 6.9 per cent in the fourth quarter.

Sri Lanka's industrial production and export activities, which suffered from depressed global market conditions since late 1997, showed clear signs of recovery during the second half of 1999. Inflation declined steadily throughout the year. Consumer price inflation declined to 4.7 per cent in 1999 from 9.4 per cent in 1998 according to the widely used Colombo Consumers' Price Index. As reflected in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator, the rate of increase in the overall price level declined to 4.4 per cent in 1999 from 8.4 per cent in the previous year. Prices declined at a faster rate than anticipated at the beginning of the year. This was due to improved domestic food supplies, containment of monetary expansion to below 15 per cent, lower import prices of food commodities and the moderation of the cascading effects in indirect taxation following the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST). Significantly higher positive real interest rates also reduced demand pressure to some extent.

The unemployment rate continued to decline, reflecting the growth of employment in the private sector, particularly in tourism, manufacturing and small businesses, in a more liberalised economic environment and new recruitment to the public sector. Unemployment during the first three quarters of 1999 was recorded at 8.8 per cent of the labour force, compared to 9.7 per in the first three quarters of the previous year.

On the external front, the current account deficit widened from 1.4 per cent of GDP in 1998 to 3 per cent in 1999, reflecting the import of three aircraft as part of capacity expansion of SriLankan Airlines and a terms of trade loss of 7 per cent. The export volume increased by 6 per cent, but earnings declined by 4 per cent as export

unit values declined by 10 per cent in a more competitive environment. Private long-term capital inflows, excluding privatisation proceeds, doubled from US dollars 296 million in 1998 to US dollars 555 million in 1999. Total long-term net capital inflows increased by lfcper cent to US dollars 396 million. The balance of payments showed an overall deficit of US dollars 263 million (1.7 per cent of GDP) due to the decline in exports, higher short-term capital outflows and a reduction in external liabilities of the commercial banks. However, the decline in the country's net foreign assets was less as there was a build up of net foreign assets by commercial banks. The country's gross foreign assets were sufficient to cover 5.3 months of current imports, while gross official reserves had an import coverage of 3.3 months.

The overall deficit in the budget declined significantly from 9.2 per cent of GDP in 1998 to 7.5 per cent in 1999, making further progress towards the medium-term goal of containing the deficit to around 5 per cent of GDP by 2002. The reduction of the fiscal deficit in 1999 came mainly through the containment of non-interest expenditure, including security expenditure, while maintaining investment expenditure close to last year's level. The security expenditures declined from 5.7 per cent of GDP to 4.9 per cent of GDP. There was also a marginal improvement in the revenue buoyancy of the tax system after indicating a declining trend in the last few years. This was attributed to the measures put in place to improve tax administration, particularly to stop the leakage of GST revenues through refunds. As the availability of net foreign resources was lower than in 1998, a larger portion of the deficit was financed through domestic sources, mainly through bank borrowings.

Considering the declining trend in inflation, the Central Bank signalled the desirability of somewhat lower interest rates by adjusting the repurchase rate downward from 11.25 to 9.25 per cent in several steps during the year and a reduction of the statutory reserve requirement from 12 to 11 per cent in August 1999. The overnight reverse repurchase rate was also reduced from 15 per cent at end 1998 to 13.48 per cent at end 1999 in line with market trends. The Central Bank purchased Treasury bills in the primary market to meet the increased demand for liquidity towards the end of the year on account of Y2K related uncertainty. Although currency in circulation increased by a maximum of Rs. 9,000 million in December, the increase was less than originally anticipated as the market had confidence in the country's preparedness for the changeover. The Bank absorbed the additional liquidity through open market operations when the financial market conditions returned to normal in January 2000. The broad money supply increased by 13.4 per cent in 1999. This was within the range of 13-15 per cent envisaged in the financial programme prepared at the beginning of the year.

Bank credit to private sector increased by 10 per cent, which was a rate consistent with the growth of private sector activities in 1999 and the trends in inflation. Provisional estimates of a comprehensive financial survey undertaken recently showed a 12 per cent growth in credit to the private sector from all financial institutions including commercial banks, development banks, finance companies, savings banks and regional development banks. It shows that private sector reliance on institutional credit is about 34 per cent of GDP. The net increase in credit to the private sector was Rs.47 billion in 1999. Credit to government from the banking system increased at a faster rate during the year, as further sales of shares of Sri Lanka Telecom were postponed for 2000. According to the financial survey, credit to government accounted for 26 per cent of the total domestic credit from institutional sources.

The Central Bank has recently strengthened the

monitoring and supervision of banking institutions with a

view to further promoting financial system stability. While the regular on-site supervision of individual banks was intensified, quarterly off-site supervision was developed as an early warning system. The banks have been informed of the desirability of improving their disclosure standards and maintaining capital adequacy ratios at 10 per cent even above the level of 8 per cent recommended under the Basle guidelines, from the beginning of 2001. Steps are being taken to improve provisioning for non-performing loans from 6 months to 3 months. Auditors of banks have been given instructions regarding the specific aspects on which they should report. While some slowing down of private sector credit growth in 1999 could be attributed to this enhanced emphasis on prudential norms, the anticipated improvement in credit culture is expected to improve the stability and soundness of the banking system. Regular monthly meetings with banks and financial institutions have also helped to solve problems and improve practices.

The financial market remained relatively stable during 1999. Interest rates indicated lower volatility with a slight decline in most interest rates, including yields on medium-term government bonds. The reduction of interest rates was in the range of 1-2 percentage points. While there was some pressure on the exchange rate during the first half of the year, it eased during the second half as the rate of inflation continued to decline. Real interest rates became more attractive for savers and investors in financial instruments. Meanwhile, there was build up of net foreign assets of commercial banks. The annual average depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar was 8.2 per cent in 1999, while the depreciation from end December 1998 to end December 1999 was 6 per cent. This behaviour of the exchange rate reflected the somewhat weaker balance of payments position in 1999.

1.2 Output

Economic Growth

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in real terms, grew by 4.3 per cent in 1999. Although this growth rate was lower than the long-run annual average growth rate of around 5 per cent, it was a satisfactory rate given the difficult environment in which the country had to manage its affairs. An acceleration of the quarterly economic growth rates was clearly seen during the year. This was reflected in all major sectors. The fourth quarter results showed an impressive growth rate of 6.9 per cent and the indications are that this growth momentum has continued into 2000, particularly in the case of industrial and trading activities. This high growth rate was achieved largely by a further improvement in productivity in the manufacturing as well as services

sectors, resulting from wider use of telecommunications and

information technology. In addition, activities such as retail

trade, light engineering, hotel and catering services,

automobile maintenance services, air-conditioning, computer

hardware and software engineering and personal services

have contributed notably to economic growth. A 15 per cent

increase in tourist arrivals in 1999 supported a growth in

related services. The export oriented industries regained

competitiveness as the real effective exchange rate

depreciated further in 1999 with the gradual appreciation of

some of the competitor country currencies and lower

domestic inflation. The continuation of favourable inflation

trends has helped to subdue wage pressures during the year.

GDP at current market prices increased by 9.1 per cent

to Rs. 1,111 billion. As the mid-year population is estimated

at 19 million, this indicated an increase in per capita annual

income to Rs.58,323 in 1999 from Rs.54,220 in 1998. In

foreign currency terms, this indicated a per capita income

of US dollars 829.

All sectors contributed to economic growth in 1999.

The Transport, storage and communications sector made the

highest contribution of 23 per cent to economic growth. The

Agriculture sector contributed 25 per cent and the

Manufacturing sector 19 per cent, while domestic trade,

tourism and informal services contributed 15 per cent. The

other sectors contributed the balance 18 per cent.

Manufacturing

Overall industrial output grew by 4.4 per cent in 1999. The output of medium and large scale factory industries, which account for about 84 per cent of total industrial output, showed a moderate growth of 4.5 per cent in 1999 amidst increased competition faced by the export sector. The processing of tea, rubber and coconut products showed a positive growth of 3.8 per cent. Manufacturing sector output contributed 16 per cent to overall economic growth in 1999, compared to 23 per cent in the previous year. The growth momentum in the industrial sector was improving steadily in the latter part of the year. The industrial output rising by 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter. The recovery was prominent in export-oriented industries as world demand was picking up with the continued high growth in the U.S. economy, the robust growth in the EU and the recovery in Japan and East Asia. They also benefited from the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate.

The apparel industry, the largest of Sri Lanka's industries, registered an 8 per cent growth in output in 1999, despite a further decline in export prices by 9 per cent in the face of growing competition. It contributed 63 per cent to industrial sector growth in 1999. Other export industries such as processed diamonds, footwear, plastics, processed fruits, machinery and equipment also recovered significantly in the latter part of 1999. Industries catering

mainly to the domestic market showed a mixed

performance, with high output growth in wheat flour, meat,

plastics, pharmaceuticals, detergents, cement, building

materials and basic metal products, but with a decline in

the output of liquor, spirits, tobacco and petroleum products.

Labour productivity increased further by 1.9 per cent in

1999. The production capacity of private sector industries

increased by 2.1 per cent, reflecting new investment.

The improved industrial performance in the latter part

of 1999 is also attributed to modernisation of factories

facilitated partly by fiscal incentives offered for adoption

of new technology. Further stimulus came from improved

telecommunications and the development of other

infrastructure facilities under the regional industrial parks

programme. While the foreign currency loans facility for

non-Board of Investments (BOI) sector exporters continued,

its relative attractiveness diminished on account of the

easing of domestic interest rates since 1997.

A total of 153 new enterprises registered under the

Board of Investment (BOI) and the Ministry of Industrial

Development commenced commercial operations during the

year. The additional employment generated in the BOI

sector was estimated at 33,000 in 1999. Many industrialists

achieved increased efficiency and cost reduction by subยญ

contracting and better procurement practices. The advantage

of lower import prices were more or less off-set by the

reduction in export prices. Wage costs could be moderated

because of lower domestic inflation. Lower interest costs

and the exchange rate depreciation also helped to improve

competitiveness.

Agriculture

Value added in agriculture increased by 4.5 per cent in 1999 reflecting higher output in paddy, tea, rubber, coconut, sugar and fish. Paddy output improved by 7 per cent and recorded the highest paddy production in recent years. The increase came from both an increase in yield and an increase in area under cultivation. Yield improvements were around 1 per cent. Rice prices remained relatively attractive during the year and fertiliser application increased by 25 per cent. With a view to stabilising domestic prices a partial duty waiver on the import of rice had been granted temporarily towards the latter part of the year. Despite the satisfactory performance in paddy production, Sri Lanka had to import 214,000 metric tons of rice in 1999.

Tea production with a further 1 per cent growth reached a new peak of 284 kg million in 1999. Tea prices improved during the second half owing to active participation by Russia at the Colombo auctions and a drop in global production reflecting lower output in India and Kenya. Nearly 60 per cent of the tea output came from smallholders. Despite a significant improvement in tea prices during the second half of the year, the annual

6

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

average price at the Colombo auctions showed a decline of

14 per cent in 1999. The average export price of tea was

12 per cent lower. As the quantity of tea exports was also

marginally lower, export earnings from tea declined by 13

per cent.

Coconut production improved by 10 per cent and

reached the highest output level since 1986. Lagged effects

of favourable weather conditions in the previous year, as

well as well distributed rainfall and increased fertiliser use

contributed to increasing output. Value added in coconut

increased by 9 per cent, compared with a 3 per cent decline

in 1998. Export earnings from coconut kernel products

increased by 64 per cent, while the earnings from other

coconut products increased by 27 per cent in 1999.

Rubber production showed a small recovery after

declining for several years. Owing to continued depression

of prices, the rate of new planting has declined by 58 per

cent, fertiliser use too has declined. However, the rubber

based domestic industry has been growing recently and this

trend continued during 1999 as well. Domestic use of

rubber by the industrial sector accounts for about 56 per

cent of total production. The tyre industry, particularly the

production of industrial tyres, has been performing well and

Sri Lanka appears to have a high potential in this area. It

is expected that natural rubber prices will pick up with the

recovery of world demand.

Among other export crops, coffee, cinnamon quills,

cloves, cardamom, nutmeg and mace and citronella

registered higher output levels. Among other field crops, big

onion output increased threefold while potato and kurakkan

production increased by 5 and 9 per cent, respectively.

Chillies, black gram, sesame and green gram production

was lower. Fish production increased by 8 per cent during

1999. Production of poultry meat and sugar also improved

during the year.

The Agriculture sector performed well in 1999 as the combined outcome of shifting cultivation to crops with higher comparative advantage, trade liberalisation, better plantation management under privatisation, improved cultivation practices and more efficient distribution systems. The Agriculture sector has tended to move from subsistence production to high value-added products based on improved technology and rational cultivation practices. This process will lead to commercialisation of agriculture and the development of agro-processing and agro-business activities. Further, with a view to improving the marketing network and assisting the small farmers, a forward market mechanism was initiated by the Central Bank during the year. Under this mechanism named the 'Govi Sahanaya', farmers are encouraged to enter into forward contracts with buyers at pre-determined remunerative prices. This scheme is expected to reduce the volatility of farmer incomes and to promote agro-business and agro-processing enterprises. In

addition, in keeping with the government's broad policy of liberalisation and encouraging private sector participation in economic activities, further liberalisation of the agricultural input and support services such as seed, planting materials, insurance and extension activities, created a more market friendly atmosphere.

Increased attention is being paid to the development of high quality seeds in Sri Lanka. In this regard the government has already initiated several measures, which include the duty free importation of seed and planting materials. The government allocated Rs.100 million to help strengthen the basic seed production centres at Maha Iluppallama, Batalagoda, Ambalantota, Bata-Ata and Nikaweratiya in 1999. The private sector is expected to play an important role in the seed industry. The Hingurakgoda seed farm of the Department of Agriculture was privatised in 1998 and the preliminary work connected with the privatisation of the Pelwehera seed farm has been completed. The privatised seed farm at Hingurakgoda is progressing well. There has been some improvement in seed paddy availability during the last Maha season.

During the year, four new rice varieties were released by the Rice Research and Development Institute at Batalagoda. One of these was a three month variety, while the others were three and a half month varieties. A new high yielding pole bean seed and a high yielding green gram variety were also released during the year.

New legislation has been enacted in 1999 to enhance the scope of agricultural insurance activities. The former Agricultural Insurance Board (AIB) was reconstituted with

7

Part 1

wider scope and-:re-named the Agricultural and Agrarian

Insurance Board (AAIB). The new law will also permit

private insurance companies to undertake crop insurance

activities.

Agricultural extension services have hitherto been

provided free of charge by the public sector. However, with

a view to improving efficiency and make the extension

activities competitive and vibrant, a fee based private

extension service was initiated as a pilot project during the

year under the Second Perennial Crop Development Project.

Under the programme for privatisation of the

management of state owned plantation companies, which

commenced in 1995, the remaining shares in the

Namunukula and Talawakelle plantations were sold to the

public through the Colombo Stock Exchange during 1999.

Granting of cultivation loans under the New

Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) continued in

1999. Under the NCRCS, loans to farmers are granted at

an interest rate of 12 per cent by participating credit

institutions. The government gives an interest subsidy of 10

percentage points to the banks. The total amount of credit

granted during the 1998/99 cultivation year amounted to

Rs.463 million.

Economic and Social Overheads

Improvement of infrastructure has been a top priority in the

country's economic development strategy. With the

declining share of security expenditure due to improved

financial discipline, public investment in infrastructure was

speeded up during the last two years, albeit not as much

as expected. The declining trend in public investment was

reversed in 1998, while also encouraging private sector

participation in this area. Public investment increased by

about one per cent of GDP, while investment by the private

sector in infrastructure development also expanded.

Government investment was mainly in the water supply and

sanitation, roads, housing and transport sectors. Construction

of the proposed highways from Colombo to Matara,

Katunayake, and Kandy is expected to be expedited.

Private sector participation <in infrastructure services increased further in 1999 with the commencement of the Queen Elizabeth Quay (QEQ) port terminal development project by South Asia Gateway Terminals (Pvt.) Ltd. (SAGT). The QEQ project will increase the present container handling capacity of the Port of Colombo by 750,000 container units per year. This is the largest ever privately funded project commenced on a BOT basis. The re-fleeting programme of SriLankan Airlines commenced in 1999 and three new aircraft were brought in during the year. Private investment in other areas, particularly telecommunications, housing, and power, expanded further. Private infrastructure projects attracted about 60 per cent of the foreign direct investment realised during 1999 under

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

BOI facilities. The Bureau of Infrastructure Investment (BII) continued to facilitate private investment in infrastructure development, while the Private Sector Infrastructure Development Company Ltd. (PSIDC) provided financial assistance to private infrastructure projects.

Despite these improvements, however, the present level of investment in infrastructure is yet inadequate. Therefore, while the private sector is called upon to play a vital role, given our stage of development, the public sector would also need to play a major role in infrastructure devlopment in areas where private sector participation is not forthcoming. Public sector leadership is essential in large infrastructure projects such as roads, railroads, dams, water supply and port development. Along with rapid improvement in economic infrastructure, investment in human resources has also become a pressing need to improve labour productivity. In this respect, education and health sector reforms are being implemented. The current strategy for improving the availability and quality of infrastructure includes construction of new infrastructure, rehabilitation and modification of existing facilities, institutional and management reforms and privatisation.

In line with the above strategy, public investment in the power sector increased by an estimated 27 per cent in 1999. The installed capacity of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was augmented by 3 per cent with the commissioning of a 40 MW thermal power plant at Sapugaskanda. The reliance on hydropower in 1999 remained at 67 per cent of total power generation. Improvement in the passenger transport sector was only moderate. Public and private sector bus fleets have expanded slightly. Further consolidation of public sector passenger transportation was under consideration to improve operational efficiency. Steps have been taken to augment the rolling stock of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR). However, more fundamental reforms of the SLR appears to be necessary to reduce its large operational losses and to improve the service. The operating loss of the SLR increased further to Rs. 1,848 million in 1999 from Rs. 1,066 million in 1998. Meanhile, fares have not been revised since 1996. With regard to road transport, the construction of the proposed expressways is expected to ease traffic congestion and improve access to regions. Several projects were underway to expand the capacity of the Port of Colombo. However, demand for port services has been almost stagnant during last two years, mainly due to competition from regional ports. In an analysis of port efficiency, the problem of staffing in the Port of Colombo would need to be examined. Further, as there could be competition between the SAGT and the rest of the port in the future, there is a need to appoint a regulator for the industry.

Investment in housing and water supply further expanded during 1999. The housing finance market needs to be developed further. Currently, bank lending to the real

8

Part 1 Central B a n k of Sri L a n k a A n n u a l Report - 1 9 9 9

estate sector is about 12 per cent of its loan portfolio.

However, these loans are for largely employee owned

houses. Three large housing projects approved by the BOI

commenced in 1999. A record number of new water

connections were provided in 1999. The high share of non-

revenue earning water has been the major problem in this

sector. More realistic pricing of urban water would be

necessary if private investment is to be encouraged.

Private sector participation in the power sector

improved significantly in 1999. Three major private thermal

power projects with a capacity of 265 MW were approved

and are to be commissioned within the next two years. This

will significantly reduce the heavy dependency on

hydropower. There are a large number of small private

sector hydropower projects with about 100 MW of capacity

at various stages of construction. The robust growth seen

in the telecommunications sector during the last 3 years

continued in 1999. Fixed telephone lines increased by 29

per cent, while the mobile telephone network expanded by

47 per cent. Investment by Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT)

increased by 31 per cent, while other private sector

investments in telecommunications rose by 19 per cent in

1999.

General education reforms, implemented on a pilot

basis in 1998, were implemented islandwide in 1999 and

are progressing satisfactorily, although there were some

problems relating to resource constraints and training. The

teaching of English and computer education have been

accorded high priority under the reforms. Implementation

of university education reforms was rather slow due to slow

response from the universities.

Implementation of health reforms was also slow, mainly due to financial constraints and non-adherence to a specific time frame. However, some progress has been made in the areas of developing one major hospital in each district and in training.

1.3 Investment and Savings

Gross domestic investment increased to 27.1 per cent of GDP in 1999, up from 25.1 per cent in 1998. As public investment remained around the same level as in the previous year, the higher investment came from the private sector, mainly the acquisition of aircraft by SriLankan Airlines. The increased investment was financed through higher national savings and increased foreign savings, reflected mainly in higher private capital inflows. The gross national savings ratio increased from 23.4 per cent of GDP in 1998 to 23.9 per cent in 1999, while the gross domestic savings ratio, i.e. savings excluding overseas employee remittances increased, to 19.8 per cent of GDP. These were reflected in the reduction of fiscal dissavings, i.e., or a reduction in the current account.

1.4 Prices

The decline of inflation to its lowest since 1985 was one

of the major favourable developments on the

macroeconomic front during the year. The low inflation in

1999 was a combined outcome of improved monetary

controls and fiscal discipline, rationalised tax and tariff

structures, greater agricultural production, low world market

prices for imported food items and improved domestic

marketing network and dissemination of price information

systems using modern communication media. The low

inflation trend helped to ease the pressure on interest rates,

wages and the exchange rate considerably while improving

international competitiveness and thereby eased the task of

overall macro economic management. However, inflationary

expectation continued to remain high, apparently the

aftereffect of a long period of high inflation in the recent

past. This reinforces the need to persevere with low

inflation for some time, so that public perceptions could be

fashioned appropriately.

Chart 1.5 Consumer Prices 1982 -1999

-All Items Food Clothing

As measured by the Colombo District Consumer Price Index (CDCPI), computed by the Central Bank , the annual average inflation in 1999 was 3.6 per cent. The Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI) computed by the Department of Census and Statistics, indicated an inflation rate of 4.7 per cent in 1999. These two indices as well as the Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index (GCPI). showed substantial deceleration in the increase in consumer prices. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) reflected a decline of 0.3 per cent in 1999. The rate of increase in food prices in the CDCPI decelerated sharply from 8.9 per cent in 1998 to 2.4 per cent in 1999, owing to improved domestic supply of rice, vegetables, coconuts and fish and improved marketing, as well as increased availability of imported food.

The narrowing of regional price variations during 1999

was a favourable outcome emerging from the development

of regional marketing centres, which have gradually helped

to improve efficiency in wholesale marketing and

distribution of agriculture commodities. Wider dissemination

of information on market conditions and prices through the

media appears to have helped reduce price fluctuations.

There was also a significant drop in the prices of all

varieties of fish, owing to both marine and inland fisheries

continuing to improve as a result of the growth in

investment in fishing vessels, including multi-day boats, and

expansion of infra-structure facilities such as fisheries

harbours. Coconut prices too dropped in 1999 reflecting

increased production. The monetary measures aimed at

easing domestic demand pressures also helped to moderate

inflation. The containment of the growth of money supply

to around 13-14 per cent, despite a somewhat higher than

originally anticipated demand for domestic resources by the

government, prevented a build up of excessive demand

pressure in the economy. The relatively slower growth in

wages in both public and private sectors also helped to ease

inflation.

Although the rupee depreciated against the US dollar

by 6 per cent in 1999, the drop in the world market prices

of major imported consumer items such as rice, sugar and

wheat grain more than compensated for the upward pressure

on prices through the currency depreciation. The price of

imported rice in terms of US dollars dropped by 13 per

cent. Sugar and wheat prices dropped by 26 per cent and

by 10 per cent, respectively. Following the world market

trends, the domestic price of wheat flour was reduced

administratively to extend a part of the benefit to

consumers. This was a refreshing change from the past

policy of holding wheat flour prices.

1.5 Wages

There were no significant wage increases in the public sector during 1999. However, wages in the organised private sector were raised at different rates for different categories, resulting in an overall increase of 2.5 per cent. Workers in agriculture, commerce and industry experienced

Chart 1.6 Wage Rate Indices (1991 = 100)

10

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

an increase in nominal wages. There was an increase of

10.6 per cent in nominal wages in the services sector. In

the unorganised sector, the nominal wages of those involved

in paddy, coconut and rubber cultivation as well as building

construction, experienced significant increases.

1.6 Unemployment

The rate of unemployment continued to decline, reflecting

growth in both the private sector and the public sector. The

proportion of public sector employment in total employment

increased, indicating a deviation from the recent trend of a

declining share of public sector employment. Tentative

estimates based on available information indicate that the

economy created about 85,000 - 90,000 new employment

opportunities in 1999. The problem of high unemployment

among youth continued to be a prominent feature. The

number who left for employment abroad in 1999 has been

estimated at 178,000.

1.7 Fiscal Policy and Budgetary Operations

Despite the constraint of the ongoing conflict in the North

and the East, the fiscal performance improved significantly

in 1999. The overall deficit declined from 9.2 per cent of

GDP in 1998 to 7.5 per cent of GDP in 1999. The current

account of the budget showed a lower deficit of 1 per cent

of GDP from 2.4 per cent in 1998. While the revenue

performance improved marginally as a percentage of GDP,

arresting the declining trend seen during the last few years,

current expenditure was contained at 18.7 per cent of GDP

compared with 19.6 per cent of GDP in the previous year.

Public investment as a ratio of GDP was 6.4 per cent

compared with 6.7 per cent in 1998. As a further sale of

shares of Sri Lanka Telecom was postponed and foreign

resources available were lower in 1999, nearly 90 per cent

of the overall deficit was financed from domestic sources.

As credit to the private sector from the banking system was

relatively sluggish and there was a decline in net foreign

assets, largely reflecting the adverse terms of trade, the

higher domestic resource absorption by the government in

1999 was met without creating a serious expansionary

impact on money [supply.

On the expenditure side, it is particularly noteworthy

that growth of current expenditure has been kept below the

growth of nominal GDP and its ratio to GDP has been

declining since 1995. This trend continued in 1999,

confirming the government's commitment to maintain fiscal

discipline. Accordingly, non-interest current expenditure was

maintained around the same level as in 1998. The growth

of the wage bill was contained at 9 per cent compared to

21 per cent in previous year. The expenditure on purchases

of goods and services declined by 9 per cent in 1999.

Capital expenditure did not reach the originally expected

level owing to) significant shortfalls in expenditures in

several major projects in ports, agriculture, railways and

energy. As a percentage of GDP, investment expenditure

indicated a marginal decline, but remained higher than the

levels in 1996 and 1997.

On the revenue side, import tariffs were further

rationalised with the maximum rate for non-agricultural

products being reduced to 30 per cent. Raw materials and

machinery not manufactured in Sri Lanka were subjected

to a tariff rate of 5 per cent, while food items were kept

at 10 per cent. Crude oil and petroleum imports were

brought under a 30 per cent rate and the import tariff on

motor vehicles was unified at 30 per cent. Excise tax

adjustments were made to bring the overall tax incidence

on petrol motor vehicles to 73 per cent and diesel vehicles

to 172 per cent, except utility vehicles. In this process, an

excise tax on petrol driven motor vehicles was introduced

while the excise tax on diesel driven motor vehicles, except

utility vehicles, was increase by 10 per cent. The national

security levy was raised to 5.5 per cent from 4.5 per cent.

Upward revisions were also made to excise taxes on

cigarettes and hard liquor. The excise tax on malt liquor

was rationalised by introducing the universally accepted tax

based on alcohol strength. Measures were also introduced

to improve tax administration, including the introduction of

a voucher system for GST refunds.

Fiscal incentives were granted to improve capital and

debt markets and for development of information

technology and training in various skills. The tariffs on

agricultural products were kept at 35 per cent to provide

protection under the current liberalised trade policy

framework, while infrastructure development programmes

were undertaken to develop the sector. The poverty

reduction programme through Samurdi income supplements

and grants and schemes to help displaced families in the

North and East were continued during 1999.

The government debt securities market was made more market oriented, by placing greater reliance on marketable Treasury bonds and extending the maturity structure of debt instruments up to 6 years. In addition, preparatory work to set up a dedicated primary dealer system for government debt securities was completed and measures were under way to introduce scripless debt securities.

Steps were also taken to improve the transparency in fiscal operations further. The publication 'Budget at a Glance' provided a concise summary of the government's annual budget proposals, public investment and development programmes and incentives for targeted groups and sectors. It also provides a medium-term fiscal policy scenario and a strategy for achieving these targets. 'Trends in Public Finance' provides information on fiscal developments, he broad policy direction of economic reforms and key economic indicators. Moreover, the publicaion 'Path to Development' gives a detailed presentation of the

1.8 The International Environment and External Sector

International Environment

The global economy, which has faced highly turbulent times since the eruption of the East Asian crisis in July 1997 and a host of other disruptions in Japan, Russia and South America, has shown signs of slow recovery since the middle of 1999. Financial markets in emerging economies displayed a return to stability with the gradual build up of investor confidence stemming from firm implementation of reforms in domestic markets. Although the risk of a global recession appears to have receded, market conditions point to the continuation of economic slowdown in many regions, particularly in Japan, Europe, Russia and most developing countries. The sharp increase in oil prices, particularly since August 1999, could have serious adverse implications on the world economy, particularly on oil-importing countries.

The world economy is estimated to have grown by 3.3 per cent in 1999, up from the slow growth of 2.5 per cent in the previous year under very adverse and volatile market conditions. Output in industrial countries rose by 3.1 per cent in 1999 owing largely to robust growth in the United States and Canada and a mild recovery in Japan. Flexible markets, prudent fiscal and monetary policies and a remarkable growth in high technology industries helped the United States to withstand the global financial turbulence and sustain an impressive growth of 4.2 per cent in 1999, while the positive spillover effects have resulted in a growth of the same magnitude in Canada.

The Japanese economy indicated signs of a turn around from the recession and is estimated to have grown by 0.3 per cent in 1999 due to a rebound in private demand as well as increased public investment under the fiscal stimulus package put in place in 1998. Newly Industrialised Asian economies grew by 7.7 per cent in 1999 against a contraction in output by 2.3 per cent in the previous year, due to faster recovery in Korea and Singapore supported, inter alia, by mildly expansionary fiscal policies. The emerging economies of Asia registered a growth of 6.0 per cent in 1999 against 3.8 per cent in the previous year. The ASEAN-4, (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand), which suffered the brunt of the currency turmoil with a contraction of 9.5 per cent in output in 1998, recovered with an estimated growth of 2.5 per cent. Continued high growth in China (7.1 per cent) and India (6.8 per cent) also contributed to the recovery in Asia. While fiscal and monetary stimuli played an important role in the economic

recovery of Malaysia and Thailand, the revival in

economies in Indonesia, India and the Philippines was

driven mainly by a turnaround in agriculture. Meanwhile,

China, aided by the fiscal stimulus introduced in mid 1998,

was able to weather the effects of the Asian crisis relatively

well. As a result, the growth in developing countries

improved from 3.2 per cent in 1998 to 3.8 per cent in 1999.

However, economic growth in the Euro area reflected

a slow down from 2.8 per cent in 1998 to 2.3 per cent in

1999 as a result of tight macro economic policies

introduced to stem signs of overheating. Growth in the

Western Hemisphere declined to 0.1 per cent owing largely

to economic slowdown in Argentina, Chile, Colombia,

Ecuador and Venezuela as a result of political uncertainties

and fragile market conditions. The slow down in Southern

America was partially off-set by improved performance by

Brazil and a relatively strong growth in Mexico under the

impact of stabilisation policies and positive spillover effects

of robust North American economies.

After an improvement in growth in 1998, economic

growth in the African region declined marginally to 2.3 per

cent owing to a host of factors such as drought, weak

market confidence and slippages in fiscal and monetary

policies. Meanwhile, the continued economic and political

uncertainties prevailing in Russia, which resulted in capital

flight and a sharp decline in foreign direct investment,

resulted in a further contraction in economic activity, with

negative effects on neighbouring economies.

Inflation in many regions reflected a convergence to lower levels. Evidently, strengthened global consensus on the merits of low inflation and the positive effects of low and stable prices on growth has induced self discipline in fiscal and monetary management. The deregulation of markets under open economic policies, the benefits of integration into economic blocs and improvements in information have also contributed to firming the commitment to achieve low inflation. Meanwhile, an increasing number of countries had either adopted or were in the process of adopting, inflation targeting in their monetary policy framework in an effort to achieve low and stable inflation. These efforts were also supported by declining commodity prices during most of the year. In this backdrop, global inflation declined to its lowest level in four decades. Consumer price inflation in advanced economies declined from 1.5 per cent to 1.4 per cent in

1999, while in developing countries it moderated from 10.1 per cent to 6.5 per cent. However, inflation in countries in transition increased sharply from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 43.7 per cent in 1999 due to supply constraints and deteriorating fiscal positions.

International trade is estimated to have accelerated from 4.2 per cent in 1998 to 4.6 per cent in 1999, owing to a partial recovery in imports and exports in advanced

13

- Paraยญcentral Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

economies, with th&vplume of imports increasing from 5.5

per-cent to 7.4 percent and the volume of exports growing

from 3.7 per cent to 4.4 per cent. The major impetus for

the growth in imports came from Japan with a growth of

5.2 per cent against a drop of 7.6 per cent in the previous

year, Canada with an improvement to 9.7 per cent and the

newly industrialised Asian economies with an improvement

of. 7.3 per. cent. Imports by developing and transition

economies, however, are estimated to have declined by 0.3

per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively in 1999. In contrast,

growth in exports registered a further slowdown in 1999

with a notable strain on exports by developing countries and

countries in transition, which grew by only 1.7 per cent and

3.9 per cent, respectively. Exports by advanced economies

increased,by 4.4 per. cent, marginally higher than the 3.7

per cent registered in 1998. Notable improvements in

exports were registered by the United States and the

emerging Asian economies withl growth rates of 3.8 per

cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively. Terms of trade moved

mainly in favour of developing countries with an

improvement of 3.6 per cent in 1999 against a deterioration

by 6.2 per cent in the previous year. However, gains in

terms of trade by developing countries as a whole contained

a further deterioration in terms of trade for Asia and

countries in transition. As a result of these changes in

international trade, current accounts of the balance of

payments in advanced countries deteriorated from a surplus

to a deficit in 1999, while those in developing and

transition economies improved somewhat owing to better

performance in the export sectors.

Meanwhile, the decline in non-fuel commodity prices seen in 1998 continued with an overall drop of 7 per cent in 1999. Sugar prices declined by 27 per cent owing to excess supply and a slowdown in demand, while wheat prices dropped by 10 per cent as a result of increased production.in the US and the EU, two major producers of wheat. Increased rice production reduced international prices of rice by 8 per.cent, while fertiliser prices declined by 3 per cent in 1999. Meanwhile, despite a drop in production as a result of weather related setbacks to production in Kenya, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia, tea prices declined by about 4 per cent in 1999 due to surpluses carried over from the previous year and a fall in demand from Russia, due both to falling real income levels and foreign exchange payment restrictions. International prices of tea indicated some improvement after July, but remained lower than in the previous year. The declining trend in rubber prices continued with a decline of about 8 per cent in 1999. Rubber prices reflected some improvement towards the end of the year due to improved demand and disruption to supply. Meanwhile, adverse weather affected coconut production in the two largest coconut exporting countries, the Philippines and Indonesia. As a result, coconut prices registered an improvement of 12 per cent in 1999. In

contrast to many non-fuel commodity prices, crude oil

prices, which remained relatively low until July, registered

an increase of 39 per cent during 1999 in response to a

production cut-back by the OPEC countries and the non-

OPEC countries such as Mexico, Norway and Russia, and

an improved demand by the east Asian economies.

The major developments in international exchange

markets during the year were the launch of a single

currency, the euro, in eleven European Union member

countries on 1 January 1999, return of market stability to

most East Asian economies after high volatility observed

since the eruption of the currency turbulence in 1997 and

noticeable variation among the three major currencies.

Robust economic conditions in the United States in an

uncertain global economic environment and increased

acceptance as a store of value strengthened the dollar

against all major currencies except the yen during the year.

After a successful launch, the euro could not maintain its

initial rate of 1.17 per US dollar and depreciated by 14 per

cent against the background of a weakening economy in the

euro area. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen, which depreciated

by 5 per cent until early July, began to appreciate thereafter

as a response to signs of economic recovery. The yen

appreciated by 8.8 per cent against the US dollar during

the year as a whole. Meanwhile, the exchange markets in

the East Asian countries exhibited relative stability during

the year. The Indonesian rupiah reflected a correction and

appreciated by 12 per cent against the dollar in comparison

to a depreciation of 31 per cent in the previous year, while

the Korean won and the Singapore dollar appreciated

marginally by 2 and 1 per cent, respectively. The Philippine

peso and the Thai baht depreciated by 5 per cent and 3 per

cent, respectively. Meanwhile, Malaysia continued with its

fixed exchange rate policy with capital controls throughout

the year. Worsening financial sector conditions and

exchange restrictions resulted in a further depreciation of

the Russian rouble by 24 per cent in 1999. The Brazilian

real depreciated by 32 per cent, while the Mexican peso

appreciated by 4 per cent against the dollar during 1999.

Short-term interest rates reflected an upward movement

during the year due to tight monetary policies adopted by

industrial economies in an attempt to addressing overheating

economic conditions. The six month LIBOR increased from

5.06 per cent at the end of 1998 to 6.05 per cent at the

end of 1999. In response to movements in short-term

interest rates, long-term interest rates increased by about 0.9

percentage points during the year. For example, the 30 year

US Treasury bond rate increased from 5.59 per cent in 1998

to 6.47 per cent in 1999.

With the restoration of stability in many emerging

market economies in response to corrective policies,

investor confidence improved substantially during the year

with significant reductions in risk perceptions regarding

14

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

their bond issues. This was a welcome development, given

the prohibitively high risk premiums factored into emerging

market bond issues during the past two years. For example,

interest spreads declined by over 575 basis points (bps) for

international bond issues by Malaysia, by 325 bps for issues

by Korea and 225 bps for issues by India and Thailand.

The spreads narrowed by 175 bps for bond issues by the

Philippines while those for China and Hong Kong declined

by about 160 bps and 65 bps, respectively. On average,

interest spreads for bond issues by these countries fell from

a range of 180 - 2,150 bps at the end of 1998 to a range

of 85 - 600 bps at the end of 1999. In response to these

developments, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand reยญ

entered to tap international capital markets in a big way

after a lapse of more than a year. On the whole, the year

witnessed a marginal improvement in net private capital

flows to emerging market economies from US dollars 75

billion in 1998 to US dollars 81 billion in 1998. However,

Asia continued to suffer from a net outflow of private

capital, albeit on a smaller scale than in the previous year,

reflecting the still high risk perception in the region and

the interest rate hikes in the United States and Europe.

The need for a new international financial architecture

capable of addressing emerging issues and the problems

faced by developing countries in the face of their economic

and financial needs received renewed global emphasis.

While there was a virtual consensus on the need for reform

of the international financial system, how to accomplish this

continued to be a much debated issue. Several noteworthy

developments aimed at strengthening the international

financial system were seen during the year.

While the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

continued its efforts to increase the transparency in the

conduct of policies by member countries by declaring a

code of good practices on transparency in monetary and

financial policies, increased emphasis was placed on

strengthening the Special Data Dissemination Standards

(SDDS) by including more comprehensive information on

external debt and investment and also by encouraging

member states to join, by providing technical assistance. In

April, the IMF introduced a Contingency Credit Line (CCL)

as a precautionary line of defence for member countries that

are implementing sound economic policies but would be

vulnerable to the contagion effects of financial crises

elsewhere. The CCL was intended to serve as an instrument

of crisis prevention. Meanwhile, the Group of Seven (G-7)

nations created the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) in

September 1999 with a view to establishing more formal

co-ordination among the lending economies to promote

more orderly conditions and reduce systemic risks.

A notable development witnessed during the year was the increased focus on poverty reduction. The World Bank

and the IMF proposed the adoption of an enhanced

framework for poverty alleviation, especially among the

poorest countries. The World Bank introduced a

Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) which calls

for a long-term development vision which incorporates

improvements in the economic and social sectors.

Meanwhile, the IMF transformed the Enhanced Structural

Adjustment Facility (ESAF) into a Poverty Reduction and

Growth Facility (PRGF) with a view to giving a greater

prominence to poverty reduction efforts in structural reforms

undertaken by countries. As these initiatives were linked to

the write off of debts of the poorest countries, concerns

have emerged on the possible neglect of countries which

are not classified in the poorest category.

The IMF's Eleventh General Review of Quotas, which

was completed in January 1998 took effect on 22 January

1999. This raised the total quotas (capital) of the Fund by

35 per cent to SDR 312 billion. Sri Lanka's quota would

increase from SDR 304 million to SDR 414 million.

Meanwhile, the International Development Association

(IDA) successfully accomplished its twelfth replenishment

during the year. This would enable IDA to enhance its soft

lending for poverty reduction programmes in poor countries.

The World Trade Organisation (WTO), which continued to

emphasise improved market access and further reducing

barriers to trade, received worldwide criticism for not being

able to address the concerns of the developing countries

adequately.

The international community, including the Group of 24 (G-24,) in which the chairmanship was held by Sri Lanka during 1999, emphasised the need for developing countries to become active partners in the next round of trade negotiations to make use of the international trading system effectively to promote growth and reduce poverty. The G-24 made a critical evaluation of the world economy following the unprecedented crisis in financial markets and called for, among other things, an international lender of last resort, more frequent use of SDRs to supplement international liquidity, a cautious approach to capital account liberalisation and a more co-ordinated approach by industrial countries in their macroeconomic management to reduce excessive volatility of exchange rates among key currencies. It stressed the need to keep developed country markets open for developing country exports. Developing countries also emphasised the need for an equitable burden sharing of costs adjustment and private sector involvement in forestalling and resolving financial crisis.

Despite the signs of a global economic recovery many challenges remain unresolved, which if not addressed efficiently, would be a threat to the sustainability of recovery. Uneven growth patterns in industrialised countries, international payments imbalances and large variation among major currencies pose serious challenges for

15

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri L a n k a A n n u a l Report - 1999

maintaining macroeconomic stability. As such, the world economic outlook for the next couple of years depends much on how, the industrialised countries, in particular, face the challenges arising from the global economic slowdown during the past two years and commitments by countries to structural reforms to foster stronger and more stable growth in the world economy. Policy strategies and growth performance in the United States, Japan and the euro area, the three key players in the global economy, would have significant influence on the direction of the global economy particularly at a time when the world economy is witnessing a slow turnaround after a depressed period of two years.

External Sector Developments

Sri Lanka's external sector developments during 1999 were dominated by the lagged effects of depressed global demand and the resultant decline in commodity prices. The external trade and balance of payments weakened somewhat during

the year. The trade deficit widened owing largely to the import of three aircraft by SriLankan Airlines during the year. The services account indicated an improvement reflecting the rapid recovery in the tourism sector. Net current transfers registered a marginal increase of 1 per cent mainly due to the combined effect of an increase in net private transfers and a decline in net official transfers during 1999. Consequently, the deficit in the current account widened from US dollars 226 million in 1998 to US dollars 495 million in 1999. The current account deficit in the balance of payments as a ratio of GDP increased from 1.4 per cent in 1998 to 3.1 per cent in 1999. Gross private long-term capital inflows recovered significantly. However, there was a decline in long-term capital flows to the government. Total gross long-term capital inflows were much higher than in the previous year. Altogether, the overall balance of payments registered a deficit of US dollars 263 million in 1999.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

The impact of declining global commodity prices on

Sri Lanka's external trade as a result of depressed global

demand during the first half of the year moderated towards

the latter part of the year with improvements in both

exports and imports. Exports which declined by as much

as 11 per cent during the first eight months of 1999,

registered a significant recovery thereafter to reduce the

annual decline to 4 per cent. Export prices declined by 10

per cent while export volume increased by 6 per cent,

mainly due to the resilience of the garments sector.

Meanwhile, imports excluding aircraft declined by 5 per

cent due both to lower international commodity prices and

a decline in the volume of imports. Imports including

aircraft increased by 0.2 per cent in 1999. Consequently,

the trade deficit widened by 19 per cent to US dollars 1,299

million in 1999. The trade deficit as a percentage of GDP

thus increased from 7 per cent in 1998 to 8.2 per cent in

1999.

Increased tourist receipts helped to generate a surplus

of US dollars 147 million in the services account. Port

related services, which contributed heavily to the services

account in the past, remained somewhat stagnant owing

largely to competition from neighbouring ports. The deficit

in the income account widened from US dollars 180 million

to US dollars 254 million due to lower income on

investments and a 3 per cent increase in interest payments

on foreign debt. Private transfer receipts increased by 6 per

cent to US dollars 1,056 million, which included

compensation payments amounting to US dollars 112

million received by over 50,000 Sri Lanka expatriates in

Kuwait who were displaced during the Gulf war. Overall,

the current account deficit increased from US dollars 226

million to US dollars 495 million during 1999.

The capital account showed higher gross inflows of US dollars 905 million in long-term capital compared with US dollars 845 million in 1999, reflecting mainly the financing of aircraft by SriLankan Airlines. There were net outflows of US dollars 13 million on account of portfolio investment. In addition, external liabilities of commercial banks declined by US dollars 120 million during the year. These short-term capital investments and higher debt repayments reduced the net capital inflows by US dollars 84 million.

The external debt stock of the country, the major portion of which consists of concessional loans, increased by 3 per cent in 1999, mainly reflecting the significant appreciation of the yen towards the latter part of the year. The debt/GDP ratio increased from 56 per cent to 57 per cent in 1999. The debt service ratio increased from 11 per cent in 1998 to 12.5 per cent in 1999.

Exchange markets remained stable during the year in

contrast to the high volatility observed in the previous year.

The declining trend in inflation eased the pressure on the

exchange rate particularly towards the latter part of the year.

The Sri Lanka rupee depreciated by 6 per cent against the

US dollar during 1999, a lower rate of depreciation than

in the previous year. The real effective exchange rate of

the Sri Lanka rupee against the 24 currency basket

depreciated by 7 per cent in 1999, indicating a protection

of the external competitiveness of the economy.

Gross external assets of the country, at US dollars

2,582 million at the end of 1999, were sufficient to finance

5.3 months of imports for 1999, while gross official

reserves, at US dollars 1,640 million, were sufficient to

finance 3.3 months of imports for 1999.

1.9 Financial Sector

Monetary Policy

Monetary policy was essentially directed at maintaining

financial stability by containing monetary expansion to

moderate inflation. A decline in net foreign assets due to

weakening of the balance of payments had a contractionary

impact on money supply, while liquidity had to be provided

to meet the Y2K related additional demand for liquidity.

Also, the domestic financing needs of the government

increased significantly during the year. Further efforts were

made to improve the market orientation of monetary policy

management.

The instability displayed in financial markets since late 1997 continued into the first half of 1998, as a consequence of the uncertainties generated by the global financial crisis. However, a significant degree of stability was achieved by the second half of 1998, and this stability was maintained into 1999. With the exception of a short period in April, when market uncertainty increased and interest rates fluctuated considerably as a result of elections and labour unrest, both the call market and the exchange market exhibited considerable stability because of better coยญordination between interest rate and exchange rate policies. Even in December, when general elections and the Year 2000 uncertainties created the potential for market instability, the markets remained relatively stable. This stability and the continuous decline in inflation enabled the Central Bank to relax its monetary stance continuously in the second half of the year, when the statutory reserve requirement (SRR) was reduced by 1 percentage point, from 12 to 11 per cent, in August. The Bank Rate was also reduced, by one percentage point, to 16 per cent. The additional liquidity the market received through the relaxation of the SRR served primarily to offset the drain of liquidity caused by the outflow in the balance of payments and any excess liquidity was mopped up through open market operations. This helped to avert a re-emergence of inflationary pressure or instability in the foreign exchange market. Open market operations continued to be the major tool for implementing monetary policy and the

17

C h a r t 1.9

M o n e y a n d C r e d i t

Chart 1.10.1 Chart 1.10.2 Monetary Aggregates (Annual) Money Supply (M2b) and Private Sector Credit

repurchase (reverse repo) rate were the primary means of

conveying signals to the market.

The continuation of the decline in inflation and the

stability in the exchange market enabled the Bank to effect

a 200 basis point reduction in the repo rate in 1999. The

repo rate was reduced from 11.25 per cent at end 1998, to

9.25 per cent at end 1999 in several steps. As a result,

some downward movement was seen in most market

interest rates.

The reduction of the SRR was also a step toward enhancing market orientation of monetary policy. It also helped to reduce the effective cost of funds of commercial banks and enabled them to reduce their lending rates. This measure resulted in a release of around Rs.2,000-2,500 million of funds sterilised by the Central Bank, to the market. The expansionary impact of this release was offset by the contractionary effect of the deficit in the balance of payments. It had the added advantage of mitigating any crowding out that would result from the increased credit obtained by the government from the banking sector.

In November and December 1999, the Central Bank used its operations in the primary and secondary markets for Treasury bills particularly to provide additional liquidity needed to meet high seasonal credit demands and liquidity needs of the Y2K transition. In order to avoid any excessive increase in interest rates due to market aberrations, the interest rate applicable to the Bank's reverse repurchase facility was maintained at a fixed level throughout the second half of December. In addition, the tenor of reverse repurchase transactions, which is usually restricted to one day, was temporarily extended upto 30 days. These measures achieved their objectives by providing confidence to the market and prevented any undue pressure on interest

rates or excessive volatility in liquidity. Despite expectations

in some sectors of the market for higher interest rates in

December, the interest rates remained relatively stable

without addition of too much liquidity.

The policy of not granting refinance under the Medium

and Long-Term Credit Fund or any other short-term facility

was continued to prevent market distortions.

Money Supply

The growth in money supply was relatively stable and

monetary aggregates moved within a comparatively narrow

range of 13-15 per cent as programmed at the beginning

of the year. A faster growth in domestic assets was partly

offset by a decline in net foreign assets. The growth of

consolidated broad money (M 2 b), which includes the

operations of foreign currency banking units (FCBUs), was

13.4 per cent in 1999. Narrow money (M :) moved in a

slightly wider range of 8-14 per cent.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

BOX1 Financial Survey

The coverage of monetary statistics was improved

recently by introducing a consolidated monetary survey

incorporating' the accounts of foreign currency banking

units into mbneary aggregates. Accordingly, a broad

money supply called M^'was presented. As a further

step forward, a financial survey has now been

produced to incorporate accounts of the nonยญ

commercial bank financial institutions in the monelary

aggregates.

In the generally accepted framework for

classifying financial statistics, monetary and financial

data are presented on three levels.- The first level

contains a consolidation of financial data into three

functional groups with the preparation of separate

balance sheets for monetary authorities (MAs), deposit .

money banks or licensed commercial banks (LCBs)

and other financial institutions (OFIs).. The second

level consolidates the data for monetary authorities and

the commercial banks into the monetary survey swhich;

provides a measure, of the volume of liquidity and

; covers the accounts of the banking sector whose.

activities are of the greatest importance in finance and

in liquidity creation. Finally, the third level and most

consolidated level combines the monetary survey and

โข-. the balance'sheets of OFIs into a 'financial survey' by

which one expects to capture the dynamic interlinks

between the, banking system and "the rest of the

organised financial sector. It measures overall private

sector liquidity' arid provides an explanation of the

origin of liquidity, assisting analysts and policy makers

to make more focussed decisions.

The need for the compilation of a comprehensive financial sector survey encompassing not only the monetary authorities and LCBs, but also OFIs, arises because in;a deregulated environment, with the.rapid growth of the financial sector and financial innovations, the distinction; between LCBs and OFIs becomes blurred, making it important to widen the institutional categories which could be the focus of policy. This development, is clearly seen in Sri Lanka in recent years. In the Sri Lankan context, the financial system consists of the banking system, OFIs and the ^unorganised financial sector. The banking system, which consists of the monetary authorities and commercial banks, is the core of the financial system. Information from these institutions is used to compute narrow money ( M ) and broad money (M 2), which

have hitherto been the main,variables considered in determining monetary policy. The changing conditions in Sri Lanka are reflected when one considers the "treatment of the foreign currency banking units (FCBUs) of commercial banks. Initially, these were - excluded from the computation of broad money aggregates, as their interaction with the domestic economy was limited. However, over time, the impact " of their operations on the domestic economy increased, and the concept of consolidated broad money (M 2 b), which includes FCBU transactions, was introduced in the second half of the 1990s.

Apart from monetary authorities and the commercial banks, the most important segments in the financial sector in Sri Lanka are Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs) and finance companies, whose liabilities include a considerable amount of deposits. The LSBs comprise 6 Regional Development Banks, the National Savings^Bank, National Development Bank; DFCC Bank, "the State Mortgage and Investment Bank and , , two private savings and development banks. There are 25 finance companies registered with the Central Bank and authorised to accept deposits from the public. The importance of LSBs and finance companies in the domestic economy has grown substantially over the years. For example, total assets of OFIs increased by more than threefold from 1990 to 1998, with their total assets amounting to Rs.223 billion at end 1998.

, They, provide a variety of services similar to those of commercial banks. although they do not provide . chequing facilities to their customers. Another - important feature of LSBs is that most,of their liabilities are medium-term to long-term in nature.

In view of these developments in the financial sector, a preliminary financial survey has been compiled, which consolidates the operations of the monetary authorities, licensed commercial banks, licensed specialised banks,.and ;the 25 finance companies. This is designed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the operations of the financial sector in formulating policies.

The new monetary aggregate that is generated in this exercise has been named M, rather than M,.

4 5 Although the definition of M 3 varies from country to country, it generally includes broad money (M2),ยซplus a wider range of instruments and issuing institutions, e.g., travellers' cheques and commercial paper. M 4, however, is generally defined to include the liabilities of other financial intermediaries as well. Hence, the

1 9

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

BOX 1 (Contd.)

new monetary aggregate has tentatively been named M 4. Computation of M,. is to be developed.

Some of the highlights of the financial survey and differences from the consolidated monetary survey as currently computed are :

. 1. An increase in money supply - The significant amount of public deposits placed with the NSB and finance companies leads to .. an increase in the monetary aggregates. However,, the growth in this - more comprehensive measure of money (M 4) in 19.98 and 1999 is very close to the growth in the currently computed consolidated broad money (M 2 b) (M 4 - 13.5 per cent and 13.0 per cent; M 2 b - 13.6 per cent and 13.4 per . cent). v

. . 2. A decrease in net foreign assets (NFA) - ;The two development financial institutions (NDB . and DFCC Bank) have obtained funds from foreign sources for .their domestic long-term lending activities. This liability results in โข . โข NFA in the financial survey being less than โข ' NFA in the consolidated monetary survey and provides a more accurate assessment of 'โข the foreign exposure of the country.

โขโข" 3. An increase in net credit to the government (NCG) - The LSBs, in particular the NSB, and to a lesser extent the finance companies, ' h o l d significant amounts of government '" paper, which is reflected in this increase. This measure provides a better assesment of the amount of,resources absorbed by the government from the financial sector, and the growth'in such absorption, than the current measure contained in the consolidated monetary survey.

4. An increase in claims on the private sector -A substantial increase is seen in the amount โข of funds provided to the private sector, indicating that the financial resources available to the- private sector are significantly higher rather than the values reflected in the consolidated monetary survey. Economic activity is financed by not only by

.credit from commerical banks, but also from ; LSBs and finance companies.

Monetary expansion was held down by the decline in

net foreign assets of the banking system. The deficit in the

balance of payments was reflected in a reduction in the net

foreign assets of the monetary authorities by approximately

Rs.12.5 billion. In contrast, the commercial banks built up

their foreign asset positions.

A sharp growth in net credit to the government (NCG)

and credit to government corporations, together with

continued credit expansion to the private sector, led to a

considerable increase in net domestic assets. Lower than

expected budgeted revenues, a shortfall in privatisation

proceeds and reduced foreign borrowings caused the

government to borrow more from the domestic banking

system. Credit to government corporations increased sharply

in 1999, in contrast to the decline in 1998. This increase

was due mainly to increased international oil prices, a

growth in the use of domestic funds for investment and

expanded retail activity by some key state corporations.

Credit to the private sector increased by 10-12 per cent

during the year. The contraction in imports and exports and

the slower overall growth in the economy tended to exert

a dampening effect on the demand for credit. The two long-

term lending institutions (i.e., NDB and DFCC Bank) also

provided approximately Rs.6,400 million of credit to this

sector. Foreign currency borrowing was less attractive to

domestic borrowers and credit to the domestic sector from

FCBUs declined in dollar terms. This was due to a decline

in interest rate on rupee credits and a slowing down of

exports.

While being concerned about additional credit needs

and the need to contain excessive monetary expansion, the

Bank provided sufficient amount of reserve money to ensure

the smooth functioning of economic activity. Total reserve

money increased by Rs.7,578 million in 1999, in

comparison to Rs.9,130 million in 1998. The reduction of

the SRR also helped to provide additional liquidity to the

market.

Interest Rates

The Central Bank's overnight repo rate and reverse repo

rate served as the primary signalling mechanisms for the

expected direction of market interest rates and were also

instrumental in restraining volatility in the call money

market. The steady decline in inflation enabled the Central

Bank to reduce its overnight repo rate, which serves as a

leading indicator in determining other interest rates in the

market, in several steps in 1999. Interest rates were broadly

stable in 1999 with some downward movement. The

reduction in interest rates was, however, much less than the

fall in inflation, resulting in an increase in real interest

rates. The reduction in the SRR in August 1999 also

contributed to the stability of the interest rates. The regular

over-subscriptions at Treasury bill and Treasury bond

auctions reflected the improved liquidity conditions in the

market throughout the. year. This availability of liquidity,

partly caused by slower growth in private sector credit and

declining inflation, helped to keep yields on government

paper stable, despite increased | borrowing by the

government.

1.10 Policies and Issues

The medium-term economic policy objective of the

government as consistently stated in several policy

documents is to promote sustainable non-inflationary

economic growth in a market friendly framework, while

ensuring balance of payments viability and protection for

vulnerable groups. As elaborated byi the President in her

Vision 21 policy statement as well as in the presentation

of the Budget 2000, the growth rate of the economy is to

be accelerated to 7-8 per cent during the first decade of this

new millenium by creating an environment for accelerated

domestic investment and higher domestic savings. While

statistical estimates are already available to show that higher

investment, a lower fiscal deficit, | a flexibly managed

exchange rate; proper co-ordination of macroeconomic

policies and productivity^ improvements could generate the

desirable outcome in terms of higher per capita income,

lower unemployment, lower inflation, declining poverty

levels and stronger balance of payments, there are serious

challenges that have to be overcome' to make the process

practicably feasible;

The greatest challenge to the above outcome is the

ongoing armed conflict jn the North and the East. While

some estimates can be made of the direct and as well as

some of the indirect costs of the armed conflict, it is not

easy to quantify other costs such as the loss of human life,

dislocation of families and the general disruption of the

social fabric. In the absence of the;conflict, Sri Lanka's

annual investment would have been about 2 to 3 percentage

points higher due to higher private investment, supported

by accelerated foreign direct investment and higher public

investment. All sectors in the economy would have grown

faster to generate an economic growth about 2 to 3

percentage points higher. Such higher growth during the last

16 years of conflict would have elevated Sri Lanka from a

low income country status to a low middle income country

status in 1994 with a per capita annual income of about

US dollars 800 in that year. The country's per capita

income wouldhave reached approximately US dollars 1,200

in 1999 instead of US dollars 829. This means that the

monthly income of an average Sri Lankan would have been

Rs. 7,040 in 1999 instead of Rs. 4,875. These approximate

figures underscore the paramount need to take all steps to

end the senseless conflict. If allowed to continue, the

conflict could seriously drain the resources and energies of

the people and marginalise the country in the international

community.

The government's economic policies during the past

few years have played more than a damage minimising role,

in this context, to generate an annual economic growth rate

of around 5 per cent of GDP. The policies implemented

have been successful in maintaining a considerable degree

of monetary and financial market stability and addressing

some of the major structural weaknesses in the economy.

These policies included the privatisation of gas, plantations,

telecommunications, the national airlines, simplification of

the tariff and tax structure including the introduction of a

goods and services tax, reduction of the tax rates, financial

sector reforms to improve efficiency and the soundness of

the system, provision of greater operational autonomy for

the state owned banks, flexible management of the

exchange rate, making the government debt management

more market oriented, rationalisation of the welfare

programmes and many more reforms. These policies not

only helped to promote market oriented economic growth

under very difficult conditions, but also helped to protect

the economy to a large extent against the adverse spillover

effects of the recent global economic recession.

Despite these positive developments on the economic

policy front, Sri Lanka has been lagging behind many other

fast growing developing countries, although she has

performed relatively better than developing countries as a

whole. For example, during 1982-91, the developing

economies in Asia grew by 6.9 per cent, while Sri Lanka's

average growth during that period was only 4.2 per cent.

During 1992-96, Sri Lanka's annual economic growth rate

of 5.2 per cent was 4 percentage points lower than the 9.1

per cent growth achieved by the developing countries in

Asia. In 1999, the Asian countries grew by 6 per cent,

particularly reflecting higher growth in India and China,

while Sri Lanka registered a growth rate of 4.3 per cent.

Growth promoting economic policies alone cannot narrow

this growing gap without effectively seeking a solution to

the conflict.

Despite the recent favourable trends in inflation, fiscal

and other economic indicators, the continuing conflict has

made these achievements less appealing to most of the rest

of the world, although the achievements are commendable,

given the difficult environment in which the government has

to conduct its economic policies. The overall fiscal deficit

in Sri Lanka has been considerably higher than the average

in the rest of the world. During 1992-96, the average fiscal

deficit of developing countries was 2.8 per cent of GDP,

while Sri Lanka had a fiscal deficit of 10.1 per cent of

GDP. Although the average fiscal deficit in developing

countries in general has increased somewhat recently, Sri

22

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

Lanka's fiscal deficit continued to be much higher than the

developing country average. The developing country

average fiscal deficit has been estimated at 4.4 per cent

of GDP in 1999, while Sri Lanka had a fiscal deficit of

7.5 per cent of GDP- Although the high deficits in Sri

Lanka are dictated by the cost of the conflict, it is the

potential costs and uncertainties associated with high fiscal

deficits that discourage investment. High fiscal deficits

make the investment climate uncertain due to their adverse

effects on inflation,' interest rates and exchange rates. It

is due to these concerns and in order to release more

resources to the private sector that recent policy statements

of the government, including the medium-term fiscal

framework presented with the budget expect to contain the

overall fiscal deficit significantly in the medium-term.

Early peace settlement to the on going conflict is essential

if these medium-term fiscal and other macro-economic

targets are to be realised. In this context, the current

attempts to find a solution to the conflict through a process

of national consensus building as well as outside

facilitation should be welcomed.

The Government of Sri Lanka has proven its

commitment to implement some of the essential economic

policy reforms effectively. However, there are major

reforms that need to be undertaken to accelerate the

economic growth process to ensure that Sri Lanka will not

lag behind in the process of increasing globalisation of

product and factor markets. It needs to be mentioned that

it is only through improved national productivity that a

country can remain competitive in the global market.

Investment in economic and social infrastructure becomes

crucial in this context. Unfortunately, the resources

available for investment in infrastructure is constrained by

the larger need o f resources for national security. In this

connection, the government has commendably sought

private sector partnership in infrastructure investment in the

fields of energy and communications.

Although the global economic conditions have

improved, uncertainties still remain about their

sustainability. Despite the high growth in the United States

and signs of recovery in Japan, these two large countries

appear vulnerable. The unbalanced growth among major

industrial countries and lack of progress in policy coยญ

ordination among them to reduce their impact on world

commodity and financial markets remained a major

concern for developing countries including Sri Lanka.

There is already a spate of macro economic policy

adjustments taking place, which have reflected in increases

in interest rates in, the United States and some of the major

industrial countries and pressures for fiscal stimulus in

Japan. In this context, the future direction of international

interest rates, exchange rates and capital flows to

developing counties are highly uncertain. The implications

of possible adverse external shocks arising from such

uncertainties can be minimised only through sound

management of the economy while strengthening the market

friendly economic policy regime.

A recent phenomenon in the world has been the

renewed move towards formation of trading blocs with

exclusive benefits to their members. Despite claims to the

contrary, these trade blocks could result in considerable

trade creation. In such an environment, Sri Lanka also has

moved a step forward in this direction. The recent Free

Trade Agreement with India provides enormous potential

for access to a large market which can facilitate higher

economic growth not only through greater trade, but also

through investment and tourism.

As indicated in the 'Sri Lanka Economy in 1999 and

the Medium-term Prospects' published by the Central Bank

in February 2000, the economic reform agenda in the next

few years needs to include the following:

โข Improving the efficiency of the public sector

through the introduction of productivity based

incentive schemes; training and re-training of

workers as well as managers; reducing the size

of the public sector; elimination of bureaucratic

delays and controls and disengaging the public

sector from activities which could be more

efficiently be provided by the private sector.

โข Pension reforms to protect the retirement

benefits of people, which tend to be eroded by

inflation, and to make the system financially

viable in the future.

โข Education reforms, as currently planned, for the

system to be able to produce an easily trainable

and productive labour force to meet the demands

of a growing economy.

โข Health reforms to improve the efficiency and

financial viability of the sector and provide

adequate health services in rural, estate and

urban areas.

โข Further encouragement of private sector

participation in commercial activities currently

undertaken by the government.

โข Development of infrastructure through private

sector participation.

โข Improvement of the operational efficiency of the

state banks.

โข Further development of the domestic debt and

capital market by permitting foreign investors to

23

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

invest in listed debt instruments and further

improving the market orientation of medium and

long-term government debt.

โข Gradual relaxation of exchange controls on

capital payments, with adequate safeguards.

โข Making further progress towards equalisation of

the incentive structure between BOI and non-

BOI sectors.

โข Reforming the controls of labour markets so as

to promote private employment.

โข Gradual move towards a complete free float of

the exchange rate system.

The government's commitment to undertake these

difficult reforms is commendable. One of the top priorities

in the reform programme shou|d be public sector reforms

to improve the efficiency of public service. This could be

combined with a reform of the pension system, a

consolidation of the national contributory provident funds

and liberalisation of the insurance sector.

While emphasising the importance of the above medium-

term measures, there are several i other short-term issues that

need urgent attention. One of these relates to the transport

sector which affects the lives of all people. There are long

standing issues in this sector which arise from inadequacies

in policy co-ordination among different modes of transport.

Maintenance of roads and railway track needs urgent attention.

With inadequate competition and inflexible fare structures, the

road and rail passenger transportation suffers from inadequate

investment and poor quality of service. As a result, people

have to resort to expensive private means of transport, which

inflict high congestion and environmental costs as well. It

raises the costs of transportation and affects the

competitiveness and regional dispersion of economic

activities. Although the. road passenger transportation sector

has undergone several major changes in its organisational

structure during the last two decades, the most appropriate

formulation is yet to be achieved. The rail transport system

incurs substantial losses and needs to be reformed to make it

efficient and commercially viable. In this respect,

improvement to the existing rail track, electrification and

expansion of rolling stock, along with restructuring of the

Railways as had been proposed earlier is critical for it to be

able to provide a better service. It is highly irrational not to

have increased the rail fares since 1996 despite significant

increases in costs.

Another on going problem is the weakness in the electricity tariff structure where tariff adjustments have not been flexible relative to cost increases and one group of consumers is being subsidised at the expense of others. The cost of power generation has increased with increasing reliance on thermal power. The share of thermal power in total power generation increased to 33 per cent in 1999 from 6 per

cent in 1995. In 1999 alone, thermal power generation

expanded by 16 per cent, while the cost increased by 39 per

cent. By 2005, the share of thermal power is likely to be in

the region of 60 per cent of the total and it has been projected

that it further increase to 83 per cent by 2017. Despite the

increased cost of power generation, the tariffs have not been

revised since 1997. The existing tariff structure enabled the

CEB only to generate a 4.9 per cent rate of return, which was

below the financially viable rate of 8 per cent agreed with the

lending institutions. The CEB was able to arrest a drastic

deterioration in its financial position in 1999 due to the

availability of internal funds and diesel at duty exempted

prices. This rising cost of electricity generation is one of the

major problems that need to be addressed early. The other

problem is the imbalanced tariff structure where industrial and

commercial enterprises are required to pay higher charges

making it difficult for them to remain competitive in

international markets. Therefore, the tariff policy has to be

reviewed to establish a more reasonable and flexible tariff

structure. There is a'so a need to explore cost minimising

measures, as frequent sharp increases in tariff may not be

possible. In this context, large scale power projects will have

to be added to the national grid in accordance with a properly

designed and executed generation plan. The coal power plant,

which was scheduled to be commissioned in 2004, was

postponed to 2006, while the Kukule Ganga project is

expected to be commissioned only in 2004, after signing the

loan agreement in 1995. An improvement in efficiency in the

power sector, particularly through minimisation of losses in

generation, transmission and distribution, which have reached

20 per cent, and a rational management of water supply should

be given priority.

The recent increase in world petroleum prices has

sharply raised the import bill and has generated a large

financing gap in the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. A part

of the cost increase has been shifted to the consumers, who

will eventually have to bear the burden. The adjustment has

been inadequate considering the financing gap of around Rs.

8,000 million for this year. While a further adjustment of

domestic prices cannot be avoided, it would be desirable

to make the petroleum prices flexible, with more frequent

changes in prices to reflect international petroleum price

trends, adjusted for exchange rate variations.

While monetary, exchange rate and fiscal policies, i.e.

the key macro economic policies, have a large role to play

in creating a climate favourable for accelerated private

investment to push the economy forward to be able to

achieve a real income growth of 7-8 per cent in the present

decade, each institution should have a clear vision and

strategy to improve its performance, whether it be a public

sector or a private sector entity. The strategy should include

mechanisms to improve work ethics and performance, with

appropriate performance evaluation systems, training and

24

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

retraining schemes, financial and other incentives based on

performance, accountability and transparency of operations

and other mechanisms to ensure adaptability to changing

conditions including absorption of new techniques and

technology. This will help to enhance productivity and

external competitiveness, which is essential for achieving

sustainable economic growth, raising living standards and

eliminating poverty within this decade.

The financial services industry is increasingly

becoming more dynamic and competitive. The Central Bank

will continue to focus primarily on price stability while

strengthening its financial sector regulatory, supervisory and

monitoring functions to ensure domestic financial market

stability. In this context, financial sector reforms will

include an amendment to the Monetary Law Act to provide

greater flexibility to conduct monetary policy.
