7. POPULATION, LABOUR FORCE AND EMPLOYMENT

7.1 Overview

In 1999, the growth rate of the mid year population

increased, consequent on higher net migration. Both the

crude birth rate and the crude death rate declined further

during the year. The rate of unemployment continued to

decline, with growth in both private sector and public

sectors. The proportion of public sector employment in total

employment increased, indicating a deviation from the recent

trend of a declining share of public sector employment.

Tentative estimates indicate that the economy created about

85,000 - 90,000 new employment opportunities in 1999. The

problem of high unemployment among the youth continued

to be a prominent feature. Placements abroad for

employment increased to 178,000 in 1999.

7.2 Population

The mid year population in 1999 is provisionally estimated

at 19,043 thousand, indicating a population growth of 1.4 per

cent over 1998 compared with 1.2 per cent in the previous

year. The higher population growth resulted from an increase

in net in-migration. The natural increase in the population,

i.e., births less deaths, declined to 209,000 persons in 1999

from 215,000 in 1998. Meanwhile, net in-migration increased

to 60,000 persons in 1999 from 7,000 in the previous year.

This resulted in an addition of 269,000 persons to the mid

year population in 1999. The density of population, which

is the number of persons per sq. km. of land, increased from

299 in 1998 to 304 in 1999.

Following the past trend, both the crude birth rate and

the crude death rate continued to decline in 1999. This has

led to a further of ageing of the population with a continuous

increase in the share of the old aged. The share of the

population in the age group 60 years and above in the total

population is projected to increase to about 18 per cent by

2021 from 8 per cent in 1991. In contrast, the population

share in the age group below 15 years is expected to fall

from 31 per cent to 19 per cent during this period.

Accordingly, the index of ageing of population, i.e., the

number of persons aged 60 and over, per hundred persons

in the age group of 0-14, is projected to increase from 26

in 1991 to 95 by end of next two decades. The resulting

increase in old age dependency will require a planned social

security system to care for the elderly. The health care

system would need to be geared to cope with health

problems of the elderly. It would also be necessary to

develop institutional means of caring for the aged since the

traditional means of an extended family system alone may

not be adequate. The promotion of retirement benefit

schemes such as contributory pensions, insurance plans and

provident funds would also be a prime need for the caring

of the elderly in order to avoid imposing an excessive burden

on the working population and an erosion of the standard

of living of the aged.

7.3 Labour Force

The labour force is the segment of population available for

current production activities and represents the total supply

of labour in the labour market. A large proportion of the

labour force is employed in the on-going economic activities

with the rest either actively seeking or awaiting employment.

The unemployed consist of the excess supply of labour over

the total demand for labour at current wage rates. Every

year, school leavers join the labour force; those reaching

retirement age leave the labour force. The demand for labour

is determined by the level of economic activity.

According to the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey of the

Department of Census and Statistics, the average household

labour force in the first three quarters of 1999 is estimated

to be around 6,646,000 persons. The labour force

participation rate (the ratio of labour force to household

population aged 10 years and above) was 51 per cent. It

to the definition adopted in the Labour Force Survey, an

employed person is one who worked for pay, profit or

unpaid family gain for one hour or more during the week

preceding the survey. Persons who are temporarily absent

from work due to factors such as illness, bad weather and

labour-management disputes are also considered as employed.

should be noted here that the increase in the labour force

participation rate since 1998 is partly a result of the

expansion of the data coverage by the Department of Census

and Statistics to include unpaid female family workers in the

labour force.

7.4 Employment

On average, nearly 91 per cent of the labour force was in employment in the first three quarters of 1999. According

Employed persons are categorised into employees, employers, self-employees (own account workers) and unpaid family workers.

According to the Survey, total employment rose from 84 per cent of the labour force in 1990 to 91 per cent by the end of the third quarter 1999. The major employment generating sectors were manufacturing, light engineering, construction, transportation and communications, trade, food outlets and catering, automobile repair services and personal

services. The expansion of small scale business enterprises

contributed significantly to employment generation. This is

reflected in the expansion of the non-employee categories of

self-employed and unpaid-family workers who are engaged

in small scale business activities. This category represented

nearly 41 per cent of total employment in 1999, a significant

expansion compared with a share of 37 per cent in 1994.

The share of the .public sector (government and semi-

government) in total employment has been declining due to

the ongoing privatisation and restructuring programmes of

semi-government institutions and a faster expansion of the

private sector.' This trend reversed somewhat in 1999.

According to the Labour Force Survey of the Department of

Census and Statistics, the share of the public sector in total

household employment had declined from 21 per cent in

1990 to 14 per cent in the third quarter of 1999. However,

the share of public sector employment increased to 14.5 per

cent during the first three quarters of 1999, compared with

14 per ceritduring the first three quarters of 1998.

According to the annual employment survey conducted by

the Central Bank, employment in the public sector covering

the central government, provincial and local governments and

semi-government institutions such as corporations and boards,

is estimated at 1,120,000 persons in 1999, an increase of 3

per cent oyer the. previous year. Of the total increase in 1999

amounting to around 29,224, nearly 10,000 were graduates

recruited under the Graduate Training Programme.

Employment in government institutions in 1999 was 822,000,

an increase.of 4 per cent from 1998. Employment in semi-

government institutions declined by about 1 per cent to

298,000 in 1999. v

The majority of public sector employees (85 per cent)

were in-regular cadres (inclusive of employees on probation);

the other employees were under contractual and other non-

regiilar categories. This share dropped by nearly 1 per cent

in 1999. Employees in staff officer/executive grade and

professional grades, inclusive of doctors, engineers, teachers

and others, were: 30 per cent of total public sector employees

whereas non-minor employee grades constituted 51 per cent.

The percentage of minor employees in total public sector

employment declined marginally in 1999.

According to the Board of Investments (BOI),

enterprises operating under the BOI generated direct

employment for nearly 32,700 persons during the year.

Enterprises in textile and garment industries contributed

nearly 84 per cent of new employment in ventures operating

under the BOI.

7.5 Unemployment

According to the Labour Force Survey, the rate of

unemployment continued to decline. The rate, which had

declined from 15.9 per cent in 1990 to 9.5 per cent in 1998,

was 8.8 per cent during the first three quarters of 1999. The

measure of unemployment is based on the current status or

labour force activity during a one week reference period. To

a certain extent, there is an ambiguity of a downward bias

of the rate of unemployment due to two factors, namely,

inclusion of unpaid family workers in the employed work

force and the short reference period (one week) in the

survey. This downward bias is more prominent since 1998

due to a change of definition made in the survey to include

unpaid family workers in the employed labour force.

Accordingly, some unpaid family workers such as

housewives, particularly in the rural sector, who are engaged

in family income generating activities but were counted as

'not in the labour force' in the previous surveys have been

included as employed since 1998. Due to this adjustment,

there is a downward bias in estimating the proportion of the

unemployed after 1998. However, the declining trend in

unemployment is apparent even when unpaid family workers

are excluded from the labour force. This adjusted

unemployment rate declined from 18 per cent in 1990 to

10.2 per cent in the third quarter of 1999. The declining

trend in unemployment was evident even when employed

and unemployed persons were identified on the basis of

labour force activities of persons during a one year reference

period. Under this definition in the Survey, a person was

considered unemployed if he/she had no employment for a

period of twenty six weeks or more during the period of

twelve months preceding the survey. The unemployment rate

corresponding to this definition also recorded a noticeable

decline from 17.4 per cent in 1990 to 10.2 per cent in the

third quarter of 1999.

Both male and female unemployment rates have

declined, female unemployment rate at a faster rate. The

female unemployment rate declined from 23.4 per cent in

1990 to 12.6 per cent in the third quarter of 1999 whereas

the male unemployment rate fell from 11.8 per cent in 1990

to 7.4 per cent in the third quarter 1999. The sharp decline

in female unemployment could be attributed to growing

employment opportunities for females in sectors which have

experienced rapid growth in recent years, namely

manufacturing, finance, communications, retail trade and

of 1999. The high incidence of unemployment among the educated was partly an outcome of the conventional education system which, based on the testing of book knowledge of students, has tended to create white collar job aspirants not compatible with labour market needs in a competitive environment. The rate of unemployment among those with lower qualifications was less. In spite of these disparities between different educational levels, the declining trend in unemployment was evident in all groups. The on­going educational reforms are expected to further ease the pressures in the labour market by re-orienting school and higher education systems to meet the changing manpower demands, particularly in the nrvatc sector.

personal services.

As regards age specific unemployment, a rather disturbing feature is the high concentration of unemployment among the younger age groups. The rate of unemployment is 32 per cent in the age cohort of 15-19 years. The situation may have been worse but for the liberalisation of the economy and greater participation by the private sector in economic activities, which have tended to generate widespread employment opportunities for youth, mainly in the manufacturing and services sectors.

The incidence of unemployment is high among the educated. The unemployment rate among persons with GCE(A/L) and above was 16.9 per cent in the third quarter

Licensed agents played a key role in securing

employment opportunities abroad. In 1999, about 68 per cent

of placements were arranged by these agents. There were

500 registered agents at the end of 1999 and 70 new licences

were issued during the year. Meanwhile, the SLBFE

cancelled 8 licences in 1999. The spread of agencies outside

Colombo has helped to expand benefits to the outstations.

In 1999, only 60 per cent of agencies were in Colombo,

compared with 70 per cent in 1995. The share of the

Colombo District in total departures for foreign employment

declined from 20 per cent in 1995 to 12 per cent in 1999.

The SLBFE continued its functions of (a) supervision

of employment agencies and (b) provision of selective

welfare measures i to overseas workers and their families.

Employment agencies and migrant workers are required to

register themselves with the SLBFE for surveillance

purposes. The welfare officers stationed in the Middle

Eastern countries and Singapore continued to assist Sri

Lankan workers. Training in household work such as use of

household appliances was provided to female domestic aides

through a number of training centres. Nearly 5,000 females

are trained each month at these centres and a total of 36,841

females were trained in 1999. The minimum monthly wage

level in employment contracts was maintained at US dollars

130. A free insurance scheme, provision of air tickets to

destitute workers for repatriation, implementation of a loan

scheme at low interest rates in collaboration with People's

Bank and Bank of Ceylon and a scholarship programme for

children were some other welfare measures which were in

operation in 1999. Under the free insurance scheme, total

compensation amounting to Rs. 85 million was paid to

6,659 workers by end 1999. During the year, 1,189 workers

who were destitute due to loss of employment were

repatriated at a cost of Rs. 20 million. Under the scholarship

programme, 1,369 children were provided with assistance

amounting to Rs.26 million by end 1999. Payment of

compensation to Sri Lankan workers displaced from Kuwait

by the Gulf War continued in 1999. During the year, Rs.

5,404 million was paid to 32,585 workers. The total

compensation paid by end 1999 amounted to Rs. 10,806

million to 68,708 workers.
