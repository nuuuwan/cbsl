    "text": "The Agriculture sector grew by 4.5 per cent in 1999, the highest'growth achieved since 1993. This was mainly due to the increased production in paddy, coconut, vegetables and fisheries. Overall, the improved performance of agricultural activities was well reflected in stable domestic food prices, mitigating the inflationary pressure in the economy. The combined paddy production in the 1998/99 Maha season and 1999 Yala season is estimated at 2,868 thousand metric tons, an increase of 6.6 per cent over the previous year. This is the highest production ever recorded. An increase in the average yield in the Maha season, as well as an increase in the extent harvested by 29 per cent in the Yala season, contributed towards the overall improvement. Output in the 'Other agriculture' sub-sector, largely consisting of vegetables, subsidiary food crops, minor export crops and animal husbandry, increased by 3.4 per cent in 1999, contributing almost one third of the growth in the agriculture sector. Vegetable production grew by 6.4 per cent, partly due to a shift to vegetable cultivation from potatoes and chillies, which have become less remunerative under the present trade policy regime. Output in the subsidiary food crops sub sector grew by 1.3 per cent supported by a bumper big onion crop and an increase in the production of red onions in the Yala season. Meanwhile, the performance of the animal husbandry sub-sector was mixed, with eggs and poultry production increasing, while milk production received a setback due to intermittent disruptions to milk collection by the major milk processing factories.",

This had an adverse impact on several industries, mainly rubber and leather products, ceramic-ware and jewellery. Reflecting the recovery of industrial exports, the performance in most industrial categories was better during the second half of the year. The apparel industry recorded growth of 6.9 per cent compared to 4.5 per cent in 1998, largely due to greater diversification into non-quota items and expansion in the production of higher value-added items. Non-metallic mineral products also grew at a faster rate compared to the previous year due to substantial growth in the output of building materials and diamond processing, where the export demand has recovered.",

SLT was able to provide around 133,700 new telephone lines in 1999. The number of subscribers for cellular phones increased by 47 per cent while that for wireless local loop telephones grew by 35 per cent. Accordingly, telephone density (the number of fixed phones per 100 persons) increased by 26 per cent from 2.79 in 1998 to 3.52 in 1999. These improvements were possible with substantial capital investments and new development projects handled by SLT and private sector operators. In addition, the quality of services in the industry improved with the application of new technology and increased competitiveness among service providers. The number of applicants on the waiting list for SLT telephone facilities indicates that this industry has potential to grow further in the coming years. Meanwhile, current expansion projects in the telecommunications sector jointly handled by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and SLT, aim to provide universal telecommunication facilities, emphasizing the rural sector of the country. Postal services also improved during the year, with the expansion of the post office network and service quality.",
