Part 1 Central B a n k of Sri Lanka A n n u a l Report - 1999

4. INDUSTRY

4.1 Overall Trends

Industrial output, measured as the output of factory

industries, showed a moderate growth of 4.5 per cent in

1999. Industrial output accounted for 84 per cent of the

manufacturing sector output and contributed 17 per cent to

overall economic growth in 1999. In the latter part of 1999,

the industrial sector showed a significant recovery marked

by a 7.7 per cent output growth in the fourth quarter. The

recovery was more prominent in export-oriented industries

resulting from robust growth of the USA and EU and

recovery in Japan and East Asian countries. Growth in the

USA and EU and the recovery in Japan generated greater

demand for Sri Lanka's exports, while the appreciation of

some of the East Asian currencies enhanced Sri Lanka's

competitiveness.

The thrust of industrial policy in 1999 was on the

development of private sector-led, export oriented industries,

with sufficient diversification in relation to both products

and geographical location. To develop a transparent and

simplified industrial policy, the Budget for 2000 emphasises

the need to unify incentives granted to BOI and non-BOI

industries. Incentives granted to the private sector to

develop a skilled labour force were continued in 1999.

Recognising the catalytic roles played by 'thrust' industries,

such as electronics and components for electronic

assembling, ceramics, glassware and mineral based products,

rubber based industries and light and heavy engineering

industries in economic growth, development incentives

granted to them were continued. Fiscal incentives granted

to develop advanced technology industries were also

continued in 1999. The Budget 2000 proposed further

measures to strengthen information technology.

The apparel industry, the largest of Sri Lanka's

industries, registered an 8.4 per cent volume growth during

the year, despite the decline of export prices by 9.2 per

cent. The apparel industry contributed 63 per cent to

industrial sector growth in 1999. Other export oriented

industries, such as processed diamonds, footwear, plastics,

processed fruits and machinery and equipment, also

recovered significantly in the latter part of 1999. Industries

catering mainly to the domestic market showed a mixed

performance with high output growth in the production of

wheat flour, meat, plastics and PVC, pharmaceuticals,

detergents, cement, building materials, basic metal products

and fabricated metal products. There was a decline in the

output of liquor, spirits, tobacco and petroleum products.

Labour productivity in 1999 increased by 1.9 per cent in

the non-BOI industrial sector. Capacity expanded by 2.1 per

cent in 1999.

The improved performance in the latter part of 1999

is also attributed to the modernisation of some industries.

The modernisation was facilitated partly by fiscal incentives

offered under the Advanced Technology Programme. Under

this programme, 356 manufacturers had imported machinery

worth Rs. 9,520 million by end 1999. Many industrialists

sought ways of cost reduction such as sub-contracting, out-

sourcing, waste reduction, waste recovery, labour

re-organisation and more efficient procurement procedures.

The global trend of declining raw material prices also

helped to lower the cost of production. Lower production

costs helped manufacturers to offer higher discounts to

buyers to remain competitive. Several large manufacturers

continued to receive export orders as they had established

strong marketing links with major international buyers.

Establishing joint ventures and adhering to stipulated

delivery dates and product standards contributed to the

inflow of export orders. Domestic market conditions were

favourable as inflation declined, interest rates remained

relatively stable and the real effective exchange rate

depreciated by about 4 per cent against competitor

countries.

Further stimulus to industrial growth came from

developments in telecommunications and the development

of other infrastructure facilities under the regional industrial

parks programme, the improvement of apparel quota

administration, availability of foreign currency loans to non-

BOI firms, and the textile sector restructuring programme.

A total!of 153 new enterprises registered under the BOI and

the Ministry of Industrial Development commenced

commercial operations during the year. The pressures for

wage increases in 1999 were relatively low due to the

prevalence of lower inflation and reduced profitability in many industries. Nevertheless, structural problems in the industrial sector, such as labour market rigidities, inadequate development of infrastructure such as roads and security related problems persisted during the year. The introduction of free market oriented labour reforms is necessary to further enhance productivity and to create employment. The scarcity of skilled and non-skilled labour is also emerging as a major impediment to faster industrial growth. The environmental pollution created by industrial waste, particularly in the rubber, plastics, metal, wood and food processing industries has also become a cause for serious concern.

4.2 Production

The basis for estimating industrial growth in 1999 was a combination of three sources i.e., the Annual Industrial Production Survey-1999 conducted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka covering 475 non-BOI enterprises, the output of public sector industries and export data on BOI industries. The estimate covers only one component of the manufacturing sector, i.e., factory output, and does not cover the other two sectors of processing of tea, rubber and coconut and small industries. Industrial output grew by 4.5 per cent in real terms and 8 per cent in nominal terms, resulting in an implicit price deflator of 3.4 per cent.

industries grew by 5.7 per cent, compared to a 6.4 per cent

growth in the previous year. Output in the non-BOI sector

grew by 5.0 per cent in 1999. compared to 7.5 per cent in

1998.

Although capacity increased, capacity utilisation of the

non-BOI sector declined marginally from 84 per cent in

1998 to 83 per cent in 1999. Profitability declined from

13.3 per cent in 1998 to 12.2 in 1999. Overall employment

in the industrial sector increased by 9 per cent. Employment

in the BOI and non-BOI industries increased by 11 per cent

and 2 per cent, respectively, in 1999.

Performance in Major Sectors

Textiles, wearing apparel and leather products

The textiles, wearing apparel and leather products category

(TWLP) accounted for nearly 41 per cent of the total

industrial production and grew by 7.3 per cent in 1999.

This growth compares well with a 4.5 per cent growth in

the previous year. The competition for lower end market

items continued during the early part of the year owing to

strenuous export efforts made by new apparel exporting

countries. The major apparel manufacturers managed to

secure sufficient export orders for winter clothes,

particularly with the recovery of world trade in the second

half of the year. The gradual shift towards up market items

had beneficial effects in securing a large number of export

orders in competitive markets. In those markets the low-

The growth in industrial output arose mainly in textiles, wearing apparel and leather products; non-metallic mineral products; food, beverages and tobacco products and fabricated metal products. These categories accounted for 95 per cent of the growth in industrial output.

Private Sector Industries

Private sector industrial output increased by 5.3 per cent in

priced apparel segment is dominated by low-cost producers

including Bangladesh, Vietnam and China.

During the latter part of the year, the quota utilisation

rate increased as a result of a decision by the Textile Quota

Board (TQB) to issue the remaining unutilised quota of

slow moving categories on a first-come-first-served-basis.

The rate of quota utilisation increased from 74 per cent in

1998 to 80 per cent in 1999. The availability of quota

C h a r t 4.3 Private Sector Industrial Volume Index

increased from 372.7 million pieces in 1998 to 388.3

million pieces in 1999. During the year, the TQB also

introduced the 'Electronic Visa Information System

(ELVIS)' for issuing export visas for exports to the USA.

This increased speed and accuracy in transmission of data,

simplification of export documentation, reliability of

transmitted information and a speedy import clearance

process in the USA. The elimination of import duties on

fabrics in 1998 helped reduce customs delays.

Total apparel and textile exports to the USA amounted to 560i square meters equivalent (SME) million, worth US dollars' 1,470 million in 1999. This amounts to 2 per cent of the total requirement in the US market. Exports of

apparel and textiles to the USA in 1999 increased by 6.1

per cent in volume and declined by 1.2 per cent in value,

indicating a 7.3 per cent drop in prices. Prices of textile

and apparel exports to US market from other countries

declined by 4.9 per cent in 1999. Apparel exports from Sri

Lanka to the US market increased from 332.5 SME million

in 1998 to 337.2 SME million in 1999, indicating 1.4 per

cent growth. Of these, 76 per cent were exported under

quota. Exports of quota items declined by 1 per cent while

non-quota apparel items increased by 9.4 per cent in 1999.

Other types of textile exports to the USA increased by 14.2

per cent from 195.2 SME million in 1998 to 223 SME

million in 1999. Of these, 94 per cent were non-quota

exports.

Overall availability of quota increased by 4.2 per cent

in 1999. There was an increase of 3.8 per cent in the US

market, 7.3 per cent in the EU countries and 1 per cent in

Canada. At present, Sri Lanka exports 50 different apparel

and textile items under quota to those markets. The quota

availability increased over 10 per cent in apparel categories

such as coats, non-suits, dresses, knit-shirts and blouses,

skirts, coveralls and overalls, dish towels, sweaters, poplin

fabrics and non-knit shirts and blouses in the USA. In the

EU, the availability of quota increased by 15 per cent in

the categories of trousers, shorts and breeches, parkas,

anoraks and windcheaters in 1999. However, the amount of

quota in respect of men's and boy's woven shirts declined

by 13 per cent in 1999 owing to low utilisation in the

previous year. The quota availability in Canada remained

unchanged in 1999 except for winter outerwear, which

increased by 54 per cent.

The trend for higher utilisation of quota in respect of

up-market items such as non-suit coats for men and boys

and suits for men and boys continued during 1999. The

quota utilisation rate in the US market increased from 78

per cent in 1998 to 85 per cent in 1999. In respect of 13

quota items, over 85 per cent was utilised during 1999.

Quotas in respect of skirts, trousers and dresses were fully

utilised during the year, while the utilisation rate was over

90 per cent in respect of knit shirts and blouses, shirts and

gowns (non-knit), terry and other pile towels and shop

towels in the US market. In the EU market, quota

utilisation rates, were high in respect of men's and women's

trousers, men's shorts and breeches and knitted and woven

blouses. However, the quota utilisation rate was below 30

per cent in quota items of parkas, anoraks and windcheaters

during the last three years. The most popular quota items

in the Canadian market were winter outerwear, trousers,

overalls and shorts and knitted and woven shirts and

blouses. The utilisation of quota in respect of coats, jackets

and rainwear, fine suits, T-shirts, athletic wear, sleepwear

and bathrobes, and swimwear were below 25 per cent due

to the inability of manufacturers to supply these products

in the required quality.

Sri Lanka will continue to face increased competition

due to the-opening up of the economies in Eastern Europe,

increased exports from new entrants, phasing out of the

Multi Fibre Agreement and growing preferential trade in the

world. In particular, exports to the USA will face stiff

competition from Mexico due to geographical proximity,

lower labour costs and duty advantages conferred under

NAFTA. New entrants are also posing1 a threat to the

expansion of Sri Lanka's apparel exports to the US market,

in particular the lower end of the market. Thus, it is

necessary for Sri Lanka to move away from the export of

quota category garments and to capture niche markets. This

will require the introduction of new technology,

improvements in information technology and increased use

of e-commerce, development of marketing relationships with

buyers of non-quota, items and timely delivery of export

orders. If the industry responds promptly to the changing

global trading environment, the Sri Lankan apparel industry

could foresee a higher growth potential.

The textile industry has not recovered fully to face import competition. Liberalisation of textile imports and reduction of textile prices in the world market following the depreciation of Asian currencies, in addition to inherent problems such as the use of old machinery, high cost of production and low quality of final products, aggravated the difficulties faced by manufacturers. However, under the textile restructuring programme, 98 enterprises submitted modernisation proposals, of which 73 enterprises were endorsed by their banks for financial facilities required for the implementation of modernisation proposals. Nearly 25 manufacturers had commenced implementing restructuring" projects.

The output of the.footwear industry increased by 3.5 per cent in 1999 owing to the increased domestic and export demand. Manufacturers introduced attractive new

designs to the domestic market during the year and those

products were well received by consumers despite the

availability of imported products in the market. Footwear

exports expanded with increased orders received from USA

and Middle Eastern countries.

Food, Beverage and Tobacco

Output of the food, beverage and tobacco industries, the

second largest in the industrial sector, grew by 2.4 per cent.

This category contributed 12 per cent to industrial sector

growth in 1999. The food sub sector grew by 5.7 per cent

and liquor production declined by 3.8 per cent, beverages

by 2.4 per cent and tobacco by 2.5 per cent. Output

increased in wheat flour, milk products, fruit processing,

biscuits, packeted tea, coconut products, sugar, beer and

meat products. The processed meat product industry grew

by 11 per cent. The introduction of new technologies in

production processes enabled manufacturers to produce and

offer various new varieties to the market. There was a

significant demand for these new products as the fish

supply was insufficient and prices were high in 1999. The

growing popularity of processed meat among the urban

population, attractive packaging, advertising and ease of

preparation helped stimulate demand for these products.

Changes in eating habits, a gradual increase in the urban

population and the introduction of new small sized packets

boosted demand for biscuits in 1999. Encouraged by the

incentives provided by government, the export oriented fruit

processing industry invested in advanced technology and

modernised factories to meet growing international demand.

However, the growth of this industry is still constrained by

the non-availability of suitable land for commercial

cultivation and high quality seeds.

Milk powder packing and manufacturing industry grew

by 4 per cent during the year. The demand for domestically

manufactured milk powder increased owing to the relative

price advantage over imported milk products as well as due

to quality improvements. This industry has high growth

potential as over 80 per cent of the total milk powder

requirement of the county is imported at present. Supported

by the recent capacity expansion and strong domestic

demand, the beer industry continued to grow despite the

increase of excise duty on liquor in 1998. The improvement

in the tourism industry also contributed to increase demand

for beer. New brands of beer were well received by

consumers. Major producers in this industry invested

heavily in advanced technology and relocated their plants

to meet the growing demand. As the consumption of beer

in the total alcohol consumption in Sri Lanka is low,

compared to other countries, there is potential for this

industry to grow in the future. Production of liquor spirits

declined in 1999 due to recent price increases as well as

the increased availability of illicit liquor.

5 2

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri L a n k a A n n u a l Report - 1 9 9 9

The beverage sub sector declined due to unusual wet

weather in 1999 which lowered the demand for soft drinks.

The production of cigarettes, especially low priced

cigarettes, also declined following the recent increase of

excise duty on tobacco and an increase in imported brands.

Generally, the demand for cigarettes has declined or

stagnated in the recent past as a result of the greater

awareness of tobacco related health problems, especially

among the youth.

Chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products

Production of chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic goods

increased by 4.6 cent in 1999. Relatively high growth was

seen in the output of industries catering largely to the

domestic market, such as soap, cosmetics, toothpaste and

detergent, pharmaceuticals, paints, varnish, fertiliser, poly

bags, rubber tyres and tubes, adhesives, plastic products,

PVC products, aryurvedic drugs and polythene. Among the

factors responsible for higher growth were the strengthening

of the distribution network, attractive packaging and low

raw material prices. The output of pharmaceuticals

registered substantial growth owing to competitive prices

compared to imported items. Quality improvements also

helped stimulate demand. The ayurvedic drug manufacturers

improved their production technologies, product quality and

packaging. They also introduced several new products

during the year. The growing demand for natural products,

especially among the urban population, stimulated the

demand for ayurvedic drugs.

As in the previous year, the plastic industry registered significant growth in 1999 due to increased domestic demand. Substitution of plastic products for wood products boosted the demand for plastic furniture, household items, ceiling sheets, other building materials and boxes used for packaging. The output of PVC and pipe fittings grew due to increased demand from the construction industry. Rubber tyres and tubes manufactured for the domestic market registered a relatively higher growth despite the increased availability of imported items in the market due to lower prices. The export oriented activated carbon industry, which faced difficulties during the last two years, declined further due to increased competition. Increased freight rates to major markets such as USA during the year aggravated the difficulties faced by this industry.

Other Products

The non-metallic mineral product category grew by 7.9 per

cent, contributing 14 per cent to industrial sector growth in

1999. The output of processed diamonds, cement, asbestos

and glass and concrete products registered a higher growth

in 1999. The diamond processing industry showed a

significant growth of 15.2 per cent with the recovery of

world trade during the second half of the year.

Manufacturers received more export orders form Japan.

Thailand, USA, Hong Kong and Belgium. The continuous

expansion of the construction industry stimulated the

demand for cement, asbestos roofing and ceiling sheets,

concrete and terracotta products. Processed silica quartz and

granite slabs also registered a higher growth in 1999.

Despite the intensified competition in the global market,

certain ceramic products have carved out niche markets in

the world market due to high quality. An increased level

of building renovation and the growing popularity of tiles

stimulated the domestic demand for floor and wall tiles.

Some manufacturers withdrew themselves from BOI status

in order to increase domestic sales that were earlier

restricted under agreements with the BOI. In the recent past

the productivity of the industry has increased significantly

with the introduction of modern plant and machinery and

modern management techniques. However, the depletion of

stocks of an essential raw material, china clay, may become

a major problem for the ceramic industry in the long-run.

The output of fabricated metal products grew by 5.4

per cent reflecting better performance in the sector catering

to the domestic market. Major products of this sector were

electrical and agricultural machinery, cables, metal furniture,

filing cabinets and office cupboards, solar water heating

panels, metal spandrels, corrugated roofing sheets, cans,

automotive batteries, light fittings, transformers, antennae,

buzzers and receivers and kitchen sinks. The demand for

office and household furniture registered a considerable

growth in 1999 mainly due to the switch over from wood

furniture to metal furniture. Improved quality and growing

popularity of television sets stimulated the demand for

antennae, buzzers and receivers. In the construction

industry, there is a shift toward the use of aluminium from

wood for windows, doorframes and partitions. Lower prices,

durability and appearance were the major reasons.

Continuous expansion of the construction industry also

boosted the demand for light fittings and electric cables.

The shipbuilding and repairing industry has improved its

infrastructure facilities, technology and skills over the years.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

However, output increased only marginally in 1999 due to

the reduction of orders placed by government. The output

of automotive batteries showed a substantial increase

indicating an expansion of domestic demand despite the

greater availability of imported batteries.

The output in the paper and paper products industry

declined by 1 per cent due to the drop in output of some

BOI industries manufacturing corrugated cartons and

printing materials. Meanwhile, the paper product industry

catering1 to the domestic market expanded by 5.5 per,cent

with the expansion of demand for newspapers, magazines,

children's books and maps, computer paper, diaries, posters

and calendars. The circulation of newspapers increased by

5 per cent in 1999 compared with 2 per cent in 1998.

Several new magazines and tabloid papers were published

during the year. The growing reading habits of school

children and inclusion of additional reading material in

school syllabi stimulated the demand for children's books.

The demand for calendars and diaries increased as a large

number of business organisations presented diaries and

calendars to their customers to mark the dawn of the new

millennium. The growing popularity of using posters for

advertising purposes boosted the demand for these products.

The output of exercise books grew moderately during the

year owing to improved quality despite the availability of

imported substitutes in the market. Output in the wood and

wood product industry grew by 3.3 per cent in 1999 to

meet demand in both export and domestic markets. The

furniture and other wood product industries benefited from

the duty waiver on the import of timber until end 1999.

Several manufacturers in the wood and furniture industry

installed new machinery during the year. However, faster

growth of the wood and furniture industry is constrained

by the scarcity and high cost of raw materials, lack of

skilled workers and shifting of consumer demand from

wood based items to steel, plastic and fiber glass based

furniture.

Public Sector Industries

The output of the public sector industrial enterprises, in real

terms, declined by 12 per cent in 1999, in contrast to the

14 per cent growth in 1998. The reduction of output of the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, due to the closure of the oil

refinery for about two months in the first half of the year

for routine maintenance, was the major reason for this

decline. The output of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

accounts for over 90 per cent of the total output of public

sector industries. Public sector industrial output, excluding

petroleum products, also decreased by 26 per cent owing

to the reduction of output in the State Rubber

Manufacturing and Export Corporation Ltd. (78 per cent),

the National Paper Co Ltd. (47 per cent), Lanka Phosphate

Ltd. (17 per cent) and Sevanagala Sugar Industries Ltd.

(2 per cent).

The output of Lanka Salt Ltd. increased by about 86

per cent in 1999, mainly due to favourable weather

conditions that prevailed during most of the year. The

relative price advantage over the competitive products in the

market, attractive packaging and gradual improvements of

quality over the years helped to increase the market share

of Lanka Salt Ltd. The output of the State Timber

Corporation increased by 4 per cent after the allocation of

more forest areas by the Forest Department for felling

operations. The output of furniture and building materials

such as door and window frames manufactured by the

corporation increased during the year owing to the increased

demand from government departments and corporations.

The output of the Sri Lanka State Rubber

Manufacturing and Export Corporation Ltd. declined mainly

due to the suspension of production for installation of new

machinery under the on-going modernisation programme.

Since July 1999, the corporation has stopped the production

of pale crepe due to the lower demand and high cost of

production of this product. Under the modernisation

programme, the production lines are now being converted

to produce rubber based final products. The National Paper

Co Ltd. experienced marketing difficulties in the face of

greater competition from imports, high cost of production

and relatively poor quality of final products arising from

outdated production processes. The output of Lanka

Phosphate Ltd. declined in 1999, mainly due to lower

demand for phosphates from the plantations sector during

the early part of the year. The output of Sevanagala Sugar

Industries Ltd., declined marginally by about 2 per cent in

1999 due to the short supply of sugarcane in 1999. It

declined to 192,000 metric tons in 1999 from 197,000

metric tons in 1998. The poor quality of the sugarcane was

also responsible for the reduction of output.

4.3 Value Addition and Capacity Utilisation

The value added in the industrial sector in nominal terms

increased by a 10.8 per cent in 1999. Value added, as a

percentage of value of production in the industrial sector,

increased from 35.2 per cent in 1998 to 36.0 per cent in

1999. The improvements in value addition during 1999 was

attributed to the reduction of raw material costs and

efficient pricing policies of the enterprises. In real terms,

the value added increased by 4.5 per cent during the year.

Improvements in value addition were in the industrial

categories of textiles, wearing apparel and leather products

and wood and wood products due to the application of

advanced technologies and the reduction of cost of

production. Value added ratios were above 45 per cent in

the industrial categories of wood and wood products; non-

metallic mineral products; fabricated metal products; food,

beverage and tobacco products and paper and paper

products. The value added ratio of the textiles, wearing

apparel and leather product category was 30.9 per cent in

1999. The lowest value added ratio of 22.1 per cent was

in the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products

categories.

The existing capacity of the non-BOI industries

expanded further by 2.1 per cent in 1999. Encouraged by

the fiscal incentives for utilisation of advanced technologies,

such as lower duty rates and lower national security levy

for importation of machinery, many industries expanded

their production capacity during the year. The capacity in

the non-metallic mineral product category expanded by 5.3

per cent reflecting the expansion of capacities in the cement

and ceramic product industries. Capacity in the textile

industry increased during the year with the expansion of

capacities of textile factories under the textile restructuring

programme. Capacity expansion was relatively high in the

industrial categories of paper and paper products (4.1 per

cent), fabricated metal products (5.0 per cent), chemical,

rubber and plastic products (3.5 per cent), and food,

beverage and tobacco products (1.2 per cent), the overall

capacity utilisation of the industrial sector declined

marginally from 84 per cent in 1998 to 83 per cent in 1999

mainly due to the slower industrial production in the early

part the year.

4.4 Cost of Production, Profitability and Employment

The average profit ratio of the non-BOl sector declined

from 13.3 per cent in 1998 to 12.2 per cent in 1999. The

profit ratio of the non-BOI sector was estimated on the

basis of the difference between the value of production and

total cost of production of the 475 firms surveyed in 1999.

The reduction of profitability is attributed to the slower

growth of prices in the international and domestic markets,

the manufacturers offered higher discounts to international

buyers to remain competitive, while the output prices in the

domestic market declined due to the availability of imported

items particularly from East Asian countries at lower prices.

However, the negative impact of lower output prices on

profitability was partly offset by the reduction of raw

material prices in the depressed global market. The cost of

raw material as a percentage of total cost of production

declined by 2.5 percentage points in 1999. The introduction

of cost reduction methods and improvements in efficiency

in many industrial categories reduced the downward

pressure on profitability in the face of lower output prices.

The cost reductions were most apparent in the industrial

categories of food, beverage and tobacco; textiles, wearing

apparel and leather products and chemical, rubber and

plastic products. Profitability varies from 17 per cent in the

textiles, wearing apparel and leather product category to 8^8

per cent in the non-metallic mineral product category.

Profitability in the food, beverage and tobacco category, the

largest sub sector in the non-BOI industries, increased from

12.5 percent in 1998 to 12.8 per cent in 1999, reflecting

prudent pricing policies as well as the reduction in the cost

of raw materials. Profitability in the miscellaneous industrial

category also increased marginally from 10.4 per cent in

1998 to 11.8 per cent in 1999. Profitability in all other

industrial categories declined in 1999. The largest decline

of 3.9 percentage points was in the textiles, wearing apparel

and leather products category due to declining export prices.

However, the profitability ratio of 17 per cent in this

category in 1999 was the highest profit ratio among all

other categories.

The total labour cost in the non-BOI industries

increased by 11.8 per cent in absolute terms in 1999. This

increase is a result of the expansion of output by 5.2 per

cent, increases in the general price level by 4.9 per cent,

expansion of the labour force by 2.1 per cent and

improvement in labour productivity by 1.9 per cent. The

labour cost as a percentage of total cost of production

remained unchanged at 12.2 per cent in 1999. The relatively

stable wage rates that prevailed in the context of lower

inflation in 1999 contained the growth of the wage bill in

the non-BOI industries. The wage bill, as a percentage of

total cost of production declined in the industrial categories

of food, beverage and tobacco; wood and wood products;

paper and paper products and fabricated metal products.

However, the share of labour cost increased in the industrial

categories of textiles, wearing apparel and leather products;

chemical, rubber and plastic products; non-metallic mineral

products and basic metal products mainly due to the

increase in the labour force. The share of labour cost in

the total cost of production is relatively high in the

industrial categories of textiles, wearing apparel and leather

products; wood and wood products and non-metallic mineral

products. The share of labour in the total cost of production

is low in the industrial categories of food, beverage and

tobacco products; basic metal products and fabricated metal

products.

Energy cost increased by 8.1 per cent during the year.

Energy costs, as a percentage of total cost of production,

declined marginally from 4.7 per cent in 1998 to 4.6 per

cent in 1999. The share of energy cost in the total cost of

production declined in many industrial categories including

textiles, wearing apparel and leather products; food,

beverage and tobacco products and chemical, rubber and

plastic products. The share of energy in the total cost of

production is over 15 per cent in the non-metallic mineral

products category. Energy also forms the principal elements

in the total cost of production in wood and wood products

and basic metal products. The share of energy costs in the

total cost of production was low in the industrial categories

of food, beverage and tobacco products and paper and paper

products.

Interest cost in the non-BOI industrial sector increased by 11 per cent in 1999. The share of interest cost in the total cost of production remained unchanged at 2.8 per cent. The capacity expansion in existing enterprises and establishment of new projects under the advanced technology incentive programme stimulated the demand for credit during the year. The share of interest cost in the total cost of production is over 4 per cent in the industrial categories of wood and wood products; paper and paper products; non-metallic mineral products and chemical, rubber and plastic products. The share of interest cost is lower in the industrial categories of food, beverage and tobacco products and textiles, wearing apparel and leather products.

Labour Productivity in Industry

Labour productivity, estimated on the basis of the change in the real value added per man-hour, increased by 1.9 per cent in 1999 in the non-BOI industries. The introduction of new technology and modern machinery, the greater awareness among middle and low level management of the advantages of improving labour productivity, a gradual increase of capital per worker, provision of training,

adoption of superior management techniques and in some

cases retrenchment of excess labour, enhanced labour

productivity in the industrial sector. The various strategies

adopted by manufacturers, such as waste reduction

programmes, energy saving methods, improvement of the

working environment and creation of good relations among

employees, also helped improve labour productivity.

However, the industrial sector was not able to reap the full

benefit of those measures due to the reduction on capacity

utilisation in many industries owing to depressed market

conditions in the early part of the year. In many industrial

categories there was a positive correlation between the

increase in value addition and productivity improvements.

Labour productivity improved in the industrial categories of

food, beverage and tobacco products (2.8 per cent),

fabricated metal products (4.3 per cent), non-metallic

mineral products (2.9 per cent) and textiles, wearing apparel

and leather products (1.1 per cent). The labour productivity

declined in the industrial categories of basic metal products

and other manufactured products.

Employment in Industry

Industrial sector employment in 1999 increased by 9 per

cent signifying the creation of more employment

opportunities in export oriented industries. Employment in

the BOI and non-BOI industries rose by 11 per cent and 2

per cent respectively. In the BOI sector, more labour was

absorbed by the apparel industry with the implementation

of the Fifty Garment Factory Programme and expansion of

existing industries. Apparel manufacturers in the export

processing zones and urban cities were not able to fill all

the vacancies in their factories due to the non-availability

of skilled and non-skilled labour. Employment in all

industrial categories in the non-BOI sector increased during

the year. Labour absorption is higher in the industrial

Employment in the food, beverage and tobacco industry

grew by 1.9 per cent due to higher labour absorption in the

meat processing, biscuits and milk product industries despite

the reduction of excess labour following the introduction of

new machinery. Employment in the tobacco processing

sector declined substantially due to the voluntary retirement

scheme introduced by a major manufacturer. Employment

in the fruit processing and sugar manufacturing industry

also declined during the year. Employment in the paper and

paper products industry grew by 4.6 per cent reflecting

higher labour absorption in the printing and packaging

industries. In the category of chemical, rubber and plastic

products more employment opportunities were created in the

sub sectors of drugs and medicine, plastics and rubber

products.

4.5 Investment

Foreign Investment

Sri Lanka continued to attract a substantial amount of

foreign investment in 1999. The amount of foreign direct

investment, defined as net foreign equity inflow into new

projects and advances by foreign shareholders, increased by

68 per cent from Rs.9,689 million in 1998 to Rs. 16,261

million in 1999, the highest amount recorded in a single

year. The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), the key

government organisation responsible for promotion of

investment, has been successful in attracting considerable

investment from Australia, the UK, Japan, India, Indonesia,

and the USA in 1999. The BOI organised several

investment promotion missions to the Republic of Korea,

India, Sweden, Norway, Singapore, Australia, the USA,

Taiwan, Italy and Switzerland in 1999. These missions were

successful in promoting investment in a number of large

scale projects including new projects such as Sun Micro

Systems of the USA with an envisaged investment of

Rs. 1,408 million, three mini hydro projects at Maduruoya

with an envisaged investment of Rs.70 million and Mast

Industries expansion project with an envisaged investment

of Rs.2,816 million. The realised investment of BOI

industries increased by 17.2 per cent in 1999 from

Rs.176,020 million in 1998 to Rs.151,206 million in 1999.

The BOI approved 342 new investment projects in 1999 with an investment commitment of Rs.103,915 million under Section 17 of the BOI Law, compared to 405 projects with an investment commitment of Rs. 104,024 million approved in the previous year. The total number of projects approved was 3,003 at end 1999. The foreign component of approved investment in 1999 was Rs.57,142 million or 55 per cent of the total approved investment. Of the approved investments in 1999, 82 enterprises were entirely foreign owned, 100 were joint venture collaborations and

160 were entirely domestic owned ventures. The employment generation capacity of these approved projects was estimated at 60,950 persons. The number of projects approved in the textiles, wearing apparel and leather products category declined from 132 in 1998 to 51 in 1999. The number of projects approved in the services sector was

185, a majority of them being software development projects. The software development industry was given special incentives by the government in 1999. A significant portion of investments were approved in chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products; food, beverage and tobacco products and non-metallic mineral products industries.

Investments in projects contracted with BOI increased

by 45 per cent in 1999. During the year, the BOI signed

agreements in respect of 207 projects with a total

investment commitment of Rs. 67,998 million compared to the 230 projects with total investment commitments of Rs.46,772 million in 1998 bringing the total number of agreements to 1,887 by end of 1999. The average contracted investment per project increased from Rs.203 million in 1998 to Rs.328 million in 1999. The foreign components of contracted investments was Rs.42,350 million or 62 per cent of the total investment in the contracted projects. The potential employment generation of these contracted projects was estimated at 42,838 persons. The major industrial categories that would absorb these investments are textiles, wearing apparel and leather products; chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products; food, beverage and tobacco products and the service sector including 34 projects in software development. There were 11 projects with total investment commitments of over Rsl,000 million. These projects include South Asia

Of the approved total investment in 1999, Rs.2,481 million or 73 per cent will come from foreign sources. Of these, 72 enterprises were entirely foreign owned and 64 are joint venture collaborations. The number

of enteiprises that were in commercial operation as at end 1999 was 471. The total estimated investment of these enterprises was Rs.19,668 million, of which Rs.10,561 million or 54 per cent was from foreign sources. The estimated employment generation capacity of these projects is 38.889 persons. The areas of investment were mainly in textiles, wearing apparel and leather products; food, beverage and tobacco products; chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products and fabricated metal products.

Local Investment

The share of local investment in projects approved under

Section 17 of the BOI Law increased marginally from 42

per cent in 1998 to 45 per cent in 1999. The local

investment commitment of these projects approved during

1999 was Rs.46.773 million compared to the Rs.43,303

million in the previous year. Meanwhile, the estimated local

investment commitment of the projects signed during the

year was Rs.25,648 million compared with Rs.20,924

million in the previous year. The share of the local

investment in the 1,070 commercially operated projects

under the BOI amounted to Rs. 63,652 million or 44 per

4.6 Availability of Credit to the Industrial Sector

During the year, more funds were available than in 1998 to the industrial sector at relatively low interest rates. Several international credit lines operated through the development banks granted low cost credit. Improvement of liquidity in the commercial banks also resulted in supplying industries with relatively low cost credit. Commercial banks continued to provide short-term as well as medium and long-term credit facilities to the industrial sector while the two development banks, National Development Bank (NDB) and DFCC Bank provided long and medium-term credit facilities in the form of direct loans, equity participation and credit facilities under certain special projects. During the year, NDB provided refinance facilities under the Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project (SMAP) launched in October 1997, using funds obtained from foreign commercial sources and the Asian Development Bank. In addition to this, NDB also provided refinance under another credit programme introduced in June 1998, namely the Small and Micro Industries Leader and Entrepreneur Promotion Project,(SMILE) with financial assistance amounting to US dollars 46 million from the Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund of Japan.

According to the Quarterly Survey of Commercial Banks Advances and Deposits, commercial bank credit to the industrial sectoriduring the first nine months of 1999 increased by 7.3 per cent to Rs.28.7 billion from Rs.26.7 billion in 1998. NDB and DFCC Bank approved financial facilities amounting ito Rs. 15,298 million to the industrial

sector in 1999. Although this was a reduction from the

Rs.22,016 million approved in 1998, the number of projects

approved in 1999 increased to 5,266 from 2,564 projects

approved in 1998. This was mainly a result of providing

refinance facilities by NDB exclusively to micro, small, and

medium-scale industries under the SMAP and SMILE credit

schemes. Of the approved credits, a sum of Rs.4,318

million was given in respect of 1,276 projects in the

chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products; Rs.2,439

million in respect of 1,366 projects in the food, beverage

and tobacco products and another Rs. 1,922 million in

respect of 461 projects in the textiles, wearing apparel and

leather products categories.

Under various credit schemes, NDB approved Rs.8,103

million in respect of 1,201 projects in 1999. Of this,

Rs.3,260 million was approved in respect of 223 projects

in the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products

category, Rs. 1,454 million in respect of 99 projects in the

textiles, wearing apparel and leather products category and

another Rs.1,122 million in respect of 207 projects in the

food, beverage and tobacco products category. NDB also

approved Rs.2,557 million refinance under the SMAP and

SMILE schemes in respect of 3,292 projects in 1999. Of

this, Rs.794 million was approved in respect of 1,056

projects in the food, beverages and tobacco products

category, Rs.674 million in respect of 1,011 projects in the

chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products category

and another Rs.494 million in respect of 493 projects in the

fabricated metal products, machinery and transport

equipment category.

Financial facilities approved by DFCC Bank in 1999

increased to Rs.4,638 million; from Rs.4,488 million in

1998, indicating an increase of 3.3 per cent. These facilities

consist of Rs.4,538 million direct loans and Rs.100 million

equity finance. During the year, DFCC Bank provided

equity finance amounting to Rs.100 million for a single

project in the food, beverage and tobacco products category.

The number of projects approved in 1999 increased to 772

from 430 projects in 1998. Under the direct loan scheme,

Rs. 1,160 million was approved in respect of 52 projects in

the fabricated metal products, Rs.423 million in respect of

102 projects in food, beverage and tobacco products and

Rs.384 million in respect of 42 projects in chemical,

petroleum, rubber and plastic products categories.

4.7 Industrial Policy

The government continued with its policy of private sector led export oriented industries. Its aim was the expansion, diversification and upgrading of the domestic industrial base, creation of new employment opportunities, efficient management of physical and manpower resources and the promotion of regional industrialisation. With a view to attracting investment, enhancing productivity and improving competitiveness, the government offered a wide range of incentives to both local and foreign investors. The National Productivity "Decade Programme launched in 1997 and the fiscal incentive scheme for the introduction of advanced technology introduced in 1996 helped increase productivity in the industrial sector and reduce unit cost of production. These, policy measures, combined with the relatively low interest and inflation rates, helped mitigate the adverse spillover effects of the recent crises in the external economy to some extent.

In order to accelerate industrial sector growth and to diversify the industrial base the government took initiatives to prepare a Master Plan for Industrialisation and Investment Promotion in 1999 with the assistance of the JICA and UNIDO. The Ministry of Industrial Development was entrusted with the responsibility of the formulation of the Master Plan for the period 2000-2010 in collaboration with these two institutions. The Master Plan is expected to be finalised in mid 2000. The: field work of the study on the Master Plan commenced in February 1999 and Stage I of the Master Plan has been: completed. A total of six sectors, namely agro-based industry, apparel industry, leather and footwear industry, rubber and plastic processing industry; general machinery industry, electric/electronic industry and information technology service industry have been identified for detailed studies as target industries. In Stage II of the Master Plan, national industrialisation programmes and strategies and programmes for development of selected target industries will be formulated.

A committee of experts from both the public and the

private sector was appointed to undertake a complete review

of the Customs Ordinance and systems and procedures, as

proposed in the Budget for 1999. While the duties on

textiles and other related materials were abolished to

overcome the Customs related problems faced by the export

oriented garment manufacturers, the duty on all imported

industrial raw materials and machinery was placed at 5 per

cent to assist domestic producers to reduce the cost of

production and enhance the competitiveness of Sri Lanka's

products.

Deficiencies in commercial and social infrastructure

facilities have been a major impediment to the growth of

the industrial sector as well geographic diversification.

Having recognised the importance of efficient and quality

infrastructure facilities, the government encouraged the

private sector involvement in developing infrastructure

facilities such as power generation, telecommunications, port

development, highways, industrial parks, and industrial

townships on BOO/BOT basis. To overcome the deficiency

of skilled labour in some major industries the Skills

Development Fund was established in 1999. The objectives

of this Fund are to encourage employers to conduct job

entry training, upgrading and retraining of their employees,

and to improve enterprise based training. With a view to

encouraging private sector involvement in setting up training

facilities in priority sectors such as gems and jewellery,

electronics, computer software and garments, a 5 year tax

holiday was granted, provided that each training institute

undertakes training for a minimum of 300 persons.

Identifying information technology as one of the thrust areas

for industrial development, a 5 year tax holiday and other

BOI incentives were granted to the software development

industry in the 1998 Budget. In order to provide further

incentives for skills development in this sector, the 1999

Budget provided tax exemptions for a 5 year period for

software training institutions which have a minimum

investment of Rs.15 million and the capacity to train a

minimum of 300 persons per year.

Incentives to the Industrial Sector

The fiscal incentive scheme introduced in 1996 to promote the use of advanced technology by domestic manufacturers was extended for a further two year period in the 1999 Budget. This scheme offers duty free import of approved machinery and equipment for new enterprises investing over Rs.4 million, for existing enterprises investing over Rs.l million and a five year tax exemption on incremental profits. The minimum investment requirements with respect to the importation of approved machinery and equipment were removed in 1999 to encourage utilisation of advanced technology in small-scale enterprises. Under this scheme, approvals were granted by the Ministry of Industrial Development for 40 new projects with an investment commitment of Rs.1,914 million and for 40 existing projects with an investment commitment of Rs.l, 121 million, in

1999. The total number of new and existing projects

approved since the commencement of this scheme amounts

to 179 and 418 respectively, with a total investment

commitment of Rs.38,557 million. These projects were

estimated to generate direct employment for about 36,649

persons. Under this scheme, machinery worth Rs.9,520

million, relating to 356 approved projects, had been

imported up to end 1999.

The 'Restructuring Programme for the Domestic Textile Industry' introduced in 1998 to encourage domestic textile manufacturers to undertake modernisation of their textile mills and to introduce a new generation of technology continued into 1999. According to the Ministry of Finance and Planning, a total of 128 applications had been received under this programme, by end December

1999. Of these, 124 applications had been considered for relief measures, while 4 applications were being processed. At end December 1999, the total outstanding debt, amounting to approximately Rs.3,998 million, had been identified for transfer to the Textile Debt Recovery Fund (TDRF) and upon the finalisation of the Tripartite Agreement for Debt Recovery, the total debt outstanding of 65 manufacturers, amounting to approximately Rs.2,910 million, has been transferred to the TDRF, in 1999. As at end December 1999, the government had paid approximately Rs.517 million to the banks and other financial institutions in respect of the debts transferred to the TDRF. By end December 1999, 98 enterprises had submitted restructuring/modernisation proposals. Of these 73 enterprises had been endorsed by their banks/financial institutions for financial facilities required for the implementation of restructuring/modernisation proposals. Of these 73 enterprises, 25 have commenced implementing their restructuring projects. The Treasury, the Ministry of Industrial Development and the BOI have already discussed the modality of' implementing the second phase of the

418 25,670 22,961 597 38,557 36,649

Source: Ministry of Industrial Development

Restructuring Programme. A decision has been made to form a Monitoring Committee and arrangements are now being made for the constitution of the Committee. Domestic textile manufacturers who do not qualify for any relief under the restructuring programme are permitted to import project related machinery, equipment, spare parts and accessories for the textile industry on a duty free basis. In addition, textile and ancillary industries undertaking domestic or export market oriented projects are permitted to obtain BOI status by meeting the minimum investment requirement, which has been lowered to Rs.5 million for small-scale projects. The Domestic Textile Quota Allocation Committee, functioning under Ministry of Industrial Development, commenced the implementation of the procurement plan in 1999. Although the procurement plan aimed to procure fabric materials for several government departments and security personnel, in 1999 the quota had been allocated only in respect of fabric requirements of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. During the year quota had been allocated to six domestic textile manufacturers for about 3.9 million meters of fabric materials.

In order to diversify both industrial and export bases, certain industries such as electronics and electronic components for assembling, ceramics and glassware, rubber and rubber based industries, light and heavy engineering, cutting and polishing of gems, diamonds and manufacture of jewellery have been declared as 'thrust industries' and special incentives were introduced to promote such industries. New enterprises which establish such industries in a designated zone with a minimum investment of Rs.50 million, create 50 new employment opportunities and export over 90 per cent of output, are eligible for a 10 year tax holiday with other BOI incentives and concessions. Non-BOI enterprises that have already engaged in a thrust industry are permitted to import plant and machinery on a

13,688

63

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1999

duty free basis to modernise the existing factories. In

addition to these duty free concessions, a 5 year tax holiday

is granted to those enterprises which reach the 50 per cent

export requirement within a period of 5 years, while a 10

year tax holiday and full BOI status would be granted to

those enterprises which comply with the 90 per cent export

requirement. A tax/exchange control amnesty was also

declared for those who invest their undisclosed accumulated

income in such thrust industries.

An incentive scheme for promoting the geographical

dispersion of industries introduced in the 1998 Budget was

extended until 31 December 1999. Under this scheme, any

enterprise in commercial operation would be entitled to

receive incentives offered under the BOI, provided that such

enterprise sets up an expansion unit or relocates in a zone

designated as a 'difficult area' or a 'most difficult area'

before 31 December 1999, employs a minimum of 150

persons and exports a minimum of 50 per cent of the

output. The minimum export requirement in the case of the

garment' industry is 90 per cent. Under this scheme, an

enterprise setting up an expansion unit or relocating to a

'difficult area' or 'most difficult area' is entitled to receive

a 5 to 8 year tax holiday along with other BOI incentives.

BOI enterprises already located in 'difficult' or 'most

difficult' areas and manufacturing garments, ancillary or

other related products for the garment industry and

operating specialised training centres are eligible for an

additional "5 year tax holiday provided that such expansion

units are commissioned before 31 December 1999 and

provide employment for a minimum of 100 persons.

National Productivity Decade Programme

The Decade of National Productivity Programme (1997-2006) which was declared in 1997 with the objective of improving productivity in both private and public sectors, continued during 1999. The theme for the year 1999 was 'Productivity Through Employer Employee Co-operation'. This was identified as being of critical importance for creating peace and harmony in the workplace. A number of radio discussions, panel discussions and TV discussion programmes were organised, highlighting the importance of employer-employee co-operation in productivity improvement. Further, meetings of employers, employees, trade union leaders, officials of Chambers of Commerce, business leaders and ILO and Labour Department officials were organised to discuss the issues involved in creating sound employer-employee co-operation. In addition, a -workshop was organised to educate public sector trade union officials on* the concept. Radio discussions on productivity were conducted in all three languages. A total of 51 English, 52 Sirihala and 10 Tamil programmes and 52 children's programmes were conducted. A TV series oh productivity was started during 1999 and 4 English and 20 Sinhala programmes were telecast. During the year, 6

seminars were organised to educate senior public officers

at the provincial and district levels, including regional

political authorities on the subject of productivity and its

applications. Workshops and lecture programmes were also

organised to educate officers of Ministries and affiliated

organisations during 1999.

4.8 Industry Location

Generally, industrialists prefer to locate their factories in

close proximity to sea and airports to reduce transport cost

and save time. This reason, together with the availability

of relatively better infrastructure facilities and incentives

provided under the Katunayake and Biyagama EPZs,

encouraged industrialists to locate their factories in the

Gampaha and Colombo districts. By the end of 1999,

approximately 75 per cent of the enterprises registered

under Sections 16 and 17 of the BOI Law and the Ministry

of Industrial Development were located in these two

districts. Excessive concentration of industries in these two

districts has created problems such as scarcity of labour,

road congestion and poor quality roads, escalation of real

estate prices, environmental pollution and congestion in the

main cities in the Western Province. Although government

in the past had taken several measures to disperse the

industries throughout the country, inadequacy of

infrastructure facilities outside the western province has

become a major obstacle to attract investors to other

regions. Having identified the urgent need of solving this

issue, the government has recently launched several key

programmes such as the Industrial Parks Development

Programme, Fifty Garment Factory. Programme, Southern

Development Programme and mini-EPZs programmes in

regions. During the year the government allocated

approximately Rs. 1,400 million for development of

infrastructure in EPZs, industrial parks and township at

regional level. Government also provided various fiscal and

financial incentives to promote the setting up of industries

in the difficult areas.

The BOI,established regional mini-EPZs in Malwatte, Mirigama, Watupitiwala, Polgahawela, Mawathagama and Horana by providing regional infrastructure facilities. The total area coverage in the Mawathagama mini-EPZ is 48 acres, and it has the capacity for setting up 16 investment plots. The Polgahawela mini-EPZ will accommodate 12 factories in an area of 36 acres. The Horana mini-EPZ extends over 412 acres and has a capacity for 60 investment projects. The employment generation capacity of these projects is estimated at 25,000 persons. The Horana industrial township project consists of housing schemes, a commercial complex, banks, hotels and recreational facilities in addition to the factories. The Malwatta mini-EPZ will accommodate 11 industries after completion of construction work. The potential employment of this project is estimated at 5,000 persons. The Mirigama mini-EPZ extending over

90 acres has the capacity for 15 industrial units. The first

phase of construction of this park was completed in mid

1999. The Watupitiwala mini-EPZ consist of 67 acres for

20 industrial plots.

Under the industrial estates/parks development

programme government established several industrial parks

by providing basic infrastructure facilities. According to the

Ministry of Industrial Development, the development work

in respect of nine industrial estates has been completed and

the development work on another six sites is nearing

completion. Nine additional sites have been earmarked for

development in the near future. When all these industrial

estates are completed, they will accommodate around 390

industrial units and provide both direct and indirect

employment for about 121,200 persons. The allocation of

blocks of land to potential investors to set up their

industrial units has already been commenced in the

industrial estates at Dankotuwa, Makandura, Kuruwita,

Karandeniya, Udukawa, Minuwangoda, Homagama, Beliatta,

Madawala-Ulpatha, Lakshauyana, Nawagampura and

Kolonnawa. At end 1999, nearly 106 blocks had been

allocated to potential investors. Forty industrial projects in

these industrial estates are in commercial operation

providing around 5,500 employment opportunities. A further

23 factory buildings were on the construction stage at end

December 1999. In addition to these programme, the

Ministry of ^Industrial Development has established

Dedicated Economic Centres (DEC) to promote economic '• activities in the regional centres. Under this programme, the

first DEC was established at Divulupitiya and the second

at Dambulla, while preliminary studies are being undertaken

to explore the possibility of setting up DECs in

EmbilipitiyaJ Monaragala, Keppetipola and Pamunuwa.

Ninety per cent of the construction work at Keppetipola has

been completed and the balance is expected to be completed

before the end of March 2000. This Centre will provide 100

vegetable stalls and two open buildings for farmers to sell

their products.

The Seethawaka Industrial Park extending over 415

acres, provides facilities for 71 factories. The direct

employment capacity of this project is estimated at 20,000

persons, while the indirect employment capacity is 25,000

persons. As at end 1999, 62 lots were allocated among the

investors and 6 factories were in commercial operation.

There were 25 projects at various stages of implementation

as at end 1999. The Seethawaka Industrial Park attracted

projects from the UK, Japan, Germany, Canada, Malaysia,

India, Korea, Hong Kong, France, Belgium and Sri Lanka

with a total investment of Rs.6,812 million generating

employment for 17,000 persons by end 1999.

Showing wider regional dispersion, 167 garment

factories were in commercial operation under the Two

Hundred Garment Factory Programme in 21 districts at end

1999. Of these, 145 (87 per cent) were located outside the

Colombo and Gampaha districts. There were 11 factories

in most difficult districts such as Monaragala, Ampara,

Trincomalee and Batticaloa. At December 1999, there were

16 factories in the Ratnapura District, 14 in the

Anuradhapura District and 12 factories in the Nuwara Eliya

District. Under the Fifty Garment Factory Programme

introduced in the 1998 Budget, 51 garment factories were

in commercial operation in 18 districts, mostly in the

Southern Province at end 1999. Of these, 21 factories (42

per cent) were located in the Galle, Matara and Hambantota

districts. Meanwhile, the Southern Development Authority

of Sri Lanka, which was established in 1996 with a view

to developing existing and new industries in the area, had

approved 246 enterprises by end 1999. Of these enterprises,

205 were in commercial operation at end 1999. With a

view to re-locating all the tanneries in a single industrial

complex, the Ministry of Industrial Development has

initiated an Industrial Park at Bata-atha in the Southern

Province. The Central Environment Authority (CEA) has

granted clearance for the implementation of this complex.

The Government of Norway in 1999 agreed to provide

finical assistance of Rs.65 million to set up a Central

Effluent Treatment Plant at Bata-atha. The UNDP started

a study on an Integrated Leather Development Programme

for Sri Lanka in August 1999, to explore possibilities for

promoting the leather products industry.
