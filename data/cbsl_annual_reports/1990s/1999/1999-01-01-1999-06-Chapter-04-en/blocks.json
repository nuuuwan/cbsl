The output of PVC and pipe fittings grew due to increased demand from the construction industry. Rubber tyres and tubes manufactured for the domestic market registered a relatively higher growth despite the increased availability of imported items in the market due to lower prices. The export oriented activated carbon industry, which faced difficulties during the last two years, declined further due to increased competition.

Several international credit lines operated through the development banks granted low cost credit. Improvement of liquidity in the commercial banks also resulted in supplying industries with relatively low cost credit. Commercial banks continued to provide short-term as well as medium and long-term credit facilities to the industrial sector while the two development banks, National Development Bank (NDB) and DFCC Bank provided long and medium-term credit facilities in the form of direct loans, equity participation and credit facilities under certain special projects. During the year, NDB provided refinance facilities under the Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project (SMAP) launched in October 1997, using funds obtained from foreign commercial sources and the Asian Development Bank. In addition to this, NDB also provided refinance under another credit programme introduced in June 1998, namely the Small and Micro Industries Leader and Entrepreneur Promotion Project,(SMILE) with financial assistance amounting to US dollars 46 million from the Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund of Japan.",

Its aim was the expansion, diversification and upgrading of the domestic industrial base, creation of new employment opportunities, efficient management of physical and manpower resources and the promotion of regional industrialisation. With a view to attracting investment, enhancing productivity and improving competitiveness, the government offered a wide range of incentives to both local and foreign investors. The National Productivity \"Decade Programme launched in 1997 and the fiscal incentive scheme for the introduction of advanced technology introduced in 1996 helped increase productivity in the industrial sector and reduce unit cost of production. These, policy measures, combined with the relatively low interest and inflation rates, helped mitigate the adverse spillover effects of the recent crises in the external economy to some extent.",
