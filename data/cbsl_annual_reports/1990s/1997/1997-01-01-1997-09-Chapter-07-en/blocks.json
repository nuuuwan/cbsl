According.to the Registrar General's Department, the mid year population in 1997 is estimated to be 18.6 million, an increase of. 1.3 percent over the previous year, due to a natural increase in population and increase in net migration. The addition of nearly 237,000 persons to the population during the year resulted in raising the density of population from 292 persons per square kilometer in 1996 to 296 persons in 1997. Although the population growth decelerated significantly during the 1990s, the population increase has created major problems such as high unemployment, high population density and land fragmentation. The available long-term population projections indicate several noteworthy features that are likely to emerge over the next few decades. They are the ageing of population and a rising dependency ratio. Among these, the ageing of the population and related economic and social policy issues need immediate attention.",

The share of population aged 65 and above has reflected an increasing trend since 1946. The proportion of that age group'increased from 3.5 per cent of the total in 1946 to 4.3 per cent in 1997. According to the latest projections, this ratio will continue to rise to 11.7 per cent by 2021. This change has resulted in a transformation of the population pyramid from a broad-based shape to a cylindrical shape. The share of children aged 0-14 years has been declining both in absolute and relative terms, as against an increase in the aged population.",

The future rate of growth of the labour force is expected to decline significantly and reach a steady state of zero growth from the year 2010 onwards. The number of youth entering the labour force will peak before 2020 and will fall thereafter. As a consequence, the problem of labour scarcity is likely to emerge in the first decade of the next century. This change in the labour market and the immediate problem of absorbing those who are currently unemployed into productive employment need to be g i v e n due consideration in the design of economic policies for the next twenty five years. In the short run there is an urgent need to promote investment, particularly in the private sector, for it to be able to provide productive employment to the currently unemployed. Labour market policies are complementary to this promotion of investment, as making the labour market more flexible and the labour force more productive and easily adaptable to industry demands would encourage private investment. If the economic growth is accelerated and new employment opportunities are generated faster through higher productive investment, a part of the ageing population, i.e., retirees after the compulsory retirement age of 60, could still be able to be actively engaged in economic activity. The education and training systems would also need to be reoriented towards promoting new skills to keep pace with technological developments.",

In Sri Lanka, successive governments have continued to implement a Luge number ol subsidy schemes and poor relief programmes such as public assistance, food rations, food stamps, Janasavija and Samurdhi, with the objective of providing economic and social security lo these gioups. In addition, there are pension schemes and schemes such as the hmployees' Provident Fund and Employees* Tnist Fund, which provide income support lo those who have passed their working age Today, governments find that it is becoming increasingly difficult to continue these social security programmes on the same scale as in the past, mamK due to iesotirce constraints.

Expansion of informal sector activities, creation of new job opportunities in the fields of computer, electronic media, and financial services and a continuation of high migration for foreign employment appeared to be the major contributory factors to the decline in unemployment. However, youth unemployment still remains high. Another feature of unemployment in Sri Lanka is the occupation desired.by the unemployed. In the 3rd Quarter of 1997, only 0.6 per cent of job aspirants desired agriculture based occupations while about 33 per cent preferred 'white collar jobs'. A continuation of high unemployment while some economic sectors experienced labour shortages has been another special feature in the Sri Lanka labour market. Therefore, a major challenge ahead is to reduce unemployment by reformulating the education system so as to match the growing labour force to the changing needs of the economy, particularly the needs of the private sector.",

This was solely due to a decline of 24 per cent in semi-government sector employment. The transfer of 22 plantation companies in 1997 to the private sector under long-term lease agreements, coupled with the public sector reform policies, led to the decline in employment in the semi-government sector. However, following the trend observed during the past years, employment in the government sector, which includes the central government, provincial councils and local authorities, registered a 1 per cent increase in 1997. The increase in government sector employment was largely reflected in the categories of clerical and related workers and administrative and managerial workers. However the occupational category of professional, technical and related workers recorded a 2 per cent drop over the preceding year mainly due to a decline of 4 per cent in the sub category of teachers as a result of retirements.",
