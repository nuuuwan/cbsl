The value of these exports increased by 8.7 per cent, from US dollars 1,204 million in 1997 to US dollars 1,308 million in 1998. There was a price gain of 5.5 per cent. This is a favorable development compared with a decline in the overall import price of apparel to the USA from all countries. Manufacturers were moving to higher value added items and Sri Lanka's apparel attracted higher prices in the USA under a highly competitive market environment.

In the EU market, the availability of quotas, except for men's and boys' woven shirts, increased in 1998. The reduction of quotas in the men's and boys' woven shirt category did not have significant impact on apparel exports because the utilisation rate of this category has been below 50 per cent. There were significant increases in the quotas for coats, jackets and rainwear, underwear, sleepwear and bath robes and bed sheets to the Canadian market.

The largest demand for other quota items in 1998 was in the categories of skirts, nightwear, underwear, shop towels and trousers. The utilisation rates in respect of low value added items such as pillowcases, dish towels, not-knit shirts and blouses were low as manufacturers shifted into high value added items. However, the lower utilisation rates in respect of parkas, anoraks, windcheaters and fine suits has been mainly due to the inadequacy of the necessary technology and skills in Sri Lanka to manufacture these items with the required quality at competitive prices.",

    "text": "The food, beverage and tobacco sub-sector grew by 9.6 per cent and contributed 28 per cent to private sector industrial growth in 1998. Sub sectors such as food, liquor and beverage in this category registered higher output levels. The food sub sector grew further, reflecting higher production of wheat flour, milk products, animal feed, biscuits, sweets and desserts, sugar and processed meat products. The demand for wheat flour increased due to the increased price of rice and growth in food preparation industries. Improvement in quality and more effective distribution channels helped the milk products industry to grow. Some leading manufacturers in this industry operated three production shifts in order to meet the growing demand. The expansion of small scale poultry farming throughout the country increased the demand for animal feed. The introduction of a range of new products in chocolates, biscuits, confectioneries and processed meat were well received by the consumers. Effective advertising and improvements in packaging also helped to raise the demand for these products. With the expansion of capacity, the output of liquor grew by 9 per cent in 1998. A capacity expansion in the beer industry in 1998 enabled it to meet the growing demand effectively. Several new brands and varieties of beer were introduced during the year. Even though prices increased, this did not depress the demand for beer significantly. In Sri Lanka, beer consumption accounts for less than 10 per cent of the total alcohol consumption, whereas in developed countries this ratio is around 80 per cent. Hence, there appears to be untapped potential in the beer industry in Sri Lanka. The growth of this industry ca be facilitated by issuing more licences to increase the network for retail sales of beer.",

The cost of imported raw materials as a percentage of total cost of production, declined marginally to 42.5 per cent in 1998 from 43.0 per cent in 1997. Many exporters had offered higher discounts to retain their export orders. The increase in the electricity cost following the imposition of GST also affected the profitability of the industrial sector. The profitability declined in many industrial categories during the year. Improvements in labour productivity in many industrial categories helped to avoid larger decline in profitability in the face of increased costs. The highest profitability was in the textile, apparel and leather product category (20.7 per cent). However, this was a decline from the 23.9 per cent in 1997. Profitability of the non-metallic mineral products category declined from 14.8 percent in 1997 to 9.4 percent in 1998. The profitability of the paper and paper products category improved from 10.9 per cent in 1997 to 11.5 per cent in 1998 owing to a reduction of cost.",

According to BOI sources, although employment opportunities for skilled labour were available in the export processing zones, the vacancies could not be filled due to shortage of workers with the required skills. Some industries were able to reduce their casual labour without affecting the production during the year. The introduction of capital intensive new technology also helped to reduce the less productive workers. Employment in the industrial categories of wood and wood products and fabricated metal products increased by over 7 per cent. Employment increases were also seen in food, beverage and tobacco products (3.4 per cent), textile, apparel and leather products (3.7 per cent), and basic metal products (4.5 per cent). There has been a reduction of employment in non-metallic mineral products by 2.3 per cent in 1998.",

The standard duty rates of 10, 20 and 35 per cent were replaced with 5, 10 and 30 per cent, respectively. Accordingly, all imported industrial raw material and machinery were brought under a duty rate of 5 per cent.

Upon transferring the outstanding debt to the Fund the enterprises become eligible to obtain new financial assistance for modernisation and restructuring of the mills against the collateral/mortgage already furnished as security for previous loans. By end 1998, about 128 entrepreneurs had submitted applications to avail themselves of relief offered under this restructuring programme. Of these, 101 applications have been considered favorably and their total debt outstanding, amounting to Rs.3,781 million, has been transferred to the Textile Debt Recovery Fund (TDRF). Of the claims relating to these 101 entrepreneurs, five have already been finalised and the rest are being processed. The government has already paid Rs.204.2 million to the banks, (Rs.97.6 million principal and Rs. 106.7 million interest) in respect of the debts transferred to the TDRF.

    "text": "Many industrialists prefer to locate their factories in the Colombo and Gampaha districts, owing to the availability of relatively better infrastructure facilities in these districts and the close proximity to the sea and air port. The concentration of industries in these districts has created several economic and social problems, including congestion in the capital city, scarcity of labour for industries, environmental pollution and escalation of real estate prices. The government has taken several policy measures in the recent past to minimise excessive concentration of industries in these areas and to discourage migration of people to those areas for employment and investment purposes. The most important measures taken by the government in this regard include the introduction of the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme and the Fifty Garment Factory Programme, the establishment of mini Export Processing Zones or Parks in Kandy, Malwatta, Watupitiwala, and Mirigama, the introduction of the regional industrial parks, industrial estates and industrial township programme, the implementation of the Southern Development Programme and the provision of fiscal incentives to set up industries in designated difficult and most difficult areas of the country.",

The Seethawaka Industrial Park established under this programme has completed its construction work in 1998 by providing infrastructure facilities such as factory buildings, access roads, electricity, water, telecommunication and waste disposal facilities. Selling of factory lots in the Seethawaka Industrial Park commenced in July 1998. The more environment friendly industries such as food processing, gems and jewellery, garments, electronic and electronic products, wooden furniture, rubber based industries and assembling of electronic components are encouraged in this park. A preliminary report on the construction of the Matugama Industrial Park, covering 300 acres, has already been prepared. State land, 105 acres in extent in Bata-atha in the Southern province, is being developed to set up an industrial park for the tanning industry, with the necessary infrastructure facilities including waste water disposal plant, chrome recovery units and a solid waste disposal system.",

These parks will cover 324 acres and will have the capacity to accommodate around 225 industrial units. At end 1998,80 blocks of land had been allocated to potential investors and 17 industrial projects in these sites were in commercial operation, employing 3,460 persons. Setting up of 15 more industrial estates in the Kurunagala, Anuradhapura, Nuwara-Eliya, Ampara, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, Jaffna, Moneragala and Kandy districts was being considered. The total extent of land to be developed under this programme has been estimated at 335 acres. The envisaged employment opportunities in these industrial estates were estimated at 15,000 persons. The 1999 Budget also proposed to set up several 'Dedicated Economic Centres' in regions in order to promote economic activities giving more consideration to area specific problems. The construction of the Divulapitiya and Damdulla Dedicated Economic Centres commenced in 1998.",
