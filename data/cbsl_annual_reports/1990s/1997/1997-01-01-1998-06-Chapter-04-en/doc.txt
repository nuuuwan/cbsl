4. INDUSTRY

4.1 Overall Trends

Industrial output grew by 7.5 per cent in 1998 as against 10.2

per cent in 1997, reflecting a strong performance of domestic

market oriented industries, such as refined petroleum products,

cement, building materials, wheat flour, animal feed, liquor,

milk products, pharmaceuticals, beverages and chemicals.

Export oriented industries experienced a mixed performance.

Fish and rubber products maintained positive growth rates, while

diamonds, gems and jewellery indicated export declines. Exports

of the apparel industry, which continued to expand in the face

of global competition, tended to slow down towards the end of

the year. Factory industries, which accounted for 84 per cent of

the manufacturing sector, contributed 28 per cent to the overall

economic growth in 1998. Capacity in the industrial sector

increased by 4 per cent in 1998. The labour productivity in the

non-BOI sector is also estimated to have increased by 4 per cent

in 1998.

The growth in the industrial sector was achieved in the

midst of a depressed global trading environment where the

growth of international trade had declined by about two thirds

following the East Asian financial crisis and subsequent

economic problems in many countries including Russia, Japan

and South and Central America. The larger devaluations of East

Asian currencies caused by the crisis, lower labour costs and

moderate inflation in the rest of the world intensified

competition. But the faster depreciation of the rupee helped to

maintain the competitiveness of domestic industry. The

economic downturn in the Asia-Pacific region depressed the

demand for exports of processed diamonds, jewellery and

ceramic products. However, several key export oriented

industries continued to perform reasonably well, as the major

buyers, who looked for product quality and reliable supply

sources, continued to place orders with Sri Lankan

manufacturers. Several large exporters had strong marketing

links with the major international buyers through their joint

ventures. Nevertheless, industrialists had to offer higher

discounts to remain competitive.

The series of policy measures introduced by the successive

budgets, including fiscal incentives for advanced technology in

industries, provision of foreign currency loans to non-BOI

exporters and the liberalisation of textile imports, together with

relatively low interest rates compared to the high rates in the

past, had a favourable impact on industrial growth. Production

capacity has expanded and the industrial base has become more

diversified. Benefiting from a removal of the duty on capital

goods, imports of investment goods increased by 12 per cent to

refurbish existing factories and to start new industries during the

year. The increased spending on advanced technology has

improved productivity in many industries, which has helped to

offset a modest acceleration of wages and salaries.

Some industrialists have adopted strategies through

awareness programmes, waste reduction methods and skills

development programmes to improve productivity. The

moderate depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee, reduction of

domestic inflation and the relatively low cost of bank borrowings

have also helped to improve external competitiveness. As

considerable amounts of raw materials for manufacturing

industries are imported from East Asian countries, the larger

devaluation in some East Asian currencies has helped to reduce

the cost of intermediate inputs. An improvement in labour

relations in the manufacturing sector was also a favorable

development in 1998. The significant improvements in basic

industrial infrastructure such as electricity, telecommunication

and port facilities and the progress made in improving

infrastructure under the industrial parks programme encouraged

new entrants to industrial activities. A total of 201 large

enterprises registered under the BOI and Ministry of Industrial

Development commenced commercial operations during the

year. Meanwhile, 37 enterprises ceased commercial operations

temporarily owing to management problems and various other

difficulties. Further development of the road and transport

systems, port facilities and the communication network, in

addition to timely upgrading of human skills and equipment,

would be necessary for faster growth in this sector. The

mismatch between demand for and supply of labour, and

rigidities in the labour market have been a constraint to faster

industrial expansion.

of BOI enterprises, the growth of industrial output in 1998 has

been estimated at 7.5 per cent. According to the survey, the

overall industrial output at current prices increased by 14 per

cent. This gives an implicit price deflator of 6 per cent for factory

industries. This reflected the rate of increase in cost of

production in the industrial sector. The growth in industrial

output in 1998 came mainly from the industrial categories of

private sector industries was in food beverage and tobacco;

chemicals, rubber, petroleum and plastic products; textiles,

apparel and leather products and fabricated metal products.

Employment in the non-BOI sector increased by 2.7 per cent

during the year. The capacity utilisation of this sector was around

84 per cent, as in the previous year, while profitability declined

from 14.9 per cent in 1997 tol2.5 per cent in 1998.

Textiles, Apparel and Leather Products

The growth of the textiles, wearing apparel and leather products

category (TWLP) in 1998 is estimated at 4.5 per cent, a

significant slowing down from the 18.7 per cent in the previous

year. This category contributed to 24.4 per cent of the growth

in private sector industrial production in 1998. Shipments in

excess of quotas, in the case of some quota items, to the USA

became a matter for concern in quota administration and some

manufacturers had to defer their exports until 1999. Hence, there

was a stock build up at the end of the year. Year end stocks with

the BOI firms increased by 12 per cent. The BOI apparel and

textile industries registered a moderate output growth of 4.6 per

cent during the year. The availability of apparel and textile

quotas increased by 4.5 per cent in 1998. The rate of quota

utilisation increased from 73.6 per cent in 1997 to 74.1 per cent

in 1998. The elimination of duties on imported textiles helped

to reduce Customs delays and price increases of clothing in the

domestic markets., but exposed the textile industry to open

import competition. The problems of some factories were

food, beverage and tobacco; chemical, rubber, petroleum and

plastic products and textiles, wearing apparel and leather

products. These categories contributed 86 per cent of the growth

in industrial output.

Private Sector Industries

Private sector industrial output grew by 6.9 per cent, down from the 12.1 per cent growth in the previous year and accounted for 93 per cent of total industrial production in 1998. The output growth of BOI industries is estimated at 6.4 per cent in 1998, compared to 19 per cent in the previous year. The domestic market oriented non-BOI industries expanded by 7.5 per cent compared to a 5.2 per cent growth in 1997. The expansion of

Chart 4.3 Private Sector Industrial Volume Index (% change)

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1998

compounded, leading to the stoppge of operations and the redundancy of about 3,000 employees (Veytex and Pugoda). However, salaries continued to be paid to these employees.

Exports of textiles and apparel from Sri Lanka to the USA accounted for 2.1 per cent of the USA requirement and 60 per cent of total apparel and textile exports by Sri Lanka in 1998. Exports of apparel to the USA increased by 3.4 per cent from 322 million square meter equivalents (SME) in 1997 to 333 SME in 1998. Of these, 77 per cent are under quota. The value of these exports increased by 8.7 per cent, from US dollars 1,204 million in 1997 to US dollars 1,308 million in 1998. There was a price gain of 5.5 per cent. This is a favorable development compared with a decline in the overall import price of apparel to the USA from all countries. Manufacturers were moving to higher value added items and Sri Lanka's apparel attracted higher prices in the USA under a highly competitive market environment. Other textile exports to the USA increased from 157 SME in 1997 to 195 SME, indicating 24 per cent growth. Exports of non-quota items increased by 25 per cent.

The total availability of quotas in 1998 increased by 4.5 per cent with a 3.2 per cent increase in the US quota, 13.3 per cent increase in the EU quota and 7.8 per cent increase in the Canadian quota. The quotas in respect of shirts and blouses, nightwear, underwear, terry and other pile towels, shop towels and fabrics, such as spun cell, woven and poplin, to the USA increased significantly during the year. In the EU market, the availability of quotas, except for men's and boys' woven shirts, increased in 1998. The reduction of quotas in the men's and boys' woven shirt category did not have significant impact on apparel exports because the utilisation rate of this category has been below 50 per cent. There were significant increases in the quotas for coats, jackets and rainwear, underwear, sleepwear and bath robes and bed sheets to the Canadian market. However, the quota in respect of high value added items such as coats for women and men, dressing gowns and trousers, did not reflect an adequate growth in 1998.

As in the previous year, the rate of utilisation of quotas shifted from low value added items to higher value added items. The quotas in the US market were fully utilised in respect of some items of coats, men's and boys' non-suits, women's and gents' coats, dresses, knit shirts and blouses, men's and boys' not-knit shirts, trousers and dressing gowns. In the Canadian market, the utilisation rates were high in the case of quota items of trousers, overalls and shorts. The largest demand for other quota items in 1998 was in the categories of skirts, nightwear, underwear, shop towels and trousers. The utilisation rates in respect of low value added items such as pillowcases, dish towels, not-knit shirts and blouses were low as manufacturers shifted into high value added items. However, the lower utilisation rates in respect of parkas, anoraks, windcheaters and fine suits has been mainly due to the inadequacy of the necessary technology and skills in Sri Lanka to manufacture these items with the required quality at competitive prices.

When the quota system is fully phased out by 2005,

•international competition is likely to be intense. In order to face this future challenge successfully, the industry needs to invest in new technology and enhance its skills to improve productivity. Improved information systems, would help the industry respond quickly to changing market conditions, particularly in preferences and designs.

Food, Beverage and Tobacco

The food, beverage and tobacco sub-sector grew by 9.6 per cent and contributed 28 per cent to private sector industrial growth in 1998. Sub sectors such as food, liquor and beverage in this category registered higher output levels. The food sub sector grew further, reflecting higher production of wheat flour, milk products, animal feed, biscuits, sweets and desserts, sugar and processed meat products. The demand for wheat flour increased due to the increased price of rice and growth in food preparation industries. Improvement in quality and more effective distribution channels helped the milk products industry to grow. Some leading manufacturers in this industry operated three production shifts in order to meet the growing demand. The expansion of small scale poultry farming throughout the country increased the demand for animal feed. The introduction of a range of new products in chocolates, biscuits, confectioneries and processed meat were well received by the consumers. Effective advertising and improvements in packaging also helped to raise the demand for these products. With the expansion of capacity, the output of liquor grew by 9 per cent in 1998. A capacity expansion in the beer industry in 1998 enabled it to meet the growing demand effectively. Several new brands and varieties of beer were introduced during the year. Even though prices increased, this did not depress the demand for beer significantly. In Sri Lanka, beer consumption accounts for less than 10 per cent of the total alcohol consumption, whereas in developed countries this ratio is around 80 per cent. Hence, there appears to be untapped potential in the beer industry in Sri Lanka. The growth of this industry ca be facilitated by issuing more licences to increase the network for retail sales of beer.

The beverage sub sector grew by 9 per cent, reflecting the growth of the tea processing and soft drinks industries. The tea processing industry benefited from attractive prices, particularly during the first half of the year. The output of the soft drink industry grew by 29 per cent. Effective advertising campaigns, introduction of new products and improvements in product packaging led to increased demand. The industry also saw improvements in productivity and in the distribution network. Improvements in refrigeration facilities and an increase in the vehicle fleet strengthened the distribution network. An improvement in the supply of fruits due to favorable weather conditions helped the fruit processing industry. With the introduction of new technology and the expansion of production capacity, the production of cordials, canned fruits and jams for export markets increased in 1998. However, the growth potential of this sector has not been fully exploited due to insufficient

52

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1998

storage facilitates, lack of commercial cultivation, quality seeds and closer integration between agriculture and industry. Tobacco processing remained sluggish for the second consecutive year. Smuggled cigarettes continued to be a major threat to this industry. The legal restrictions on advertising tobacco products and the greater awareness of tobacco related health problems also reduced the demand for cigarettes especially among the youth. The value of cigarette sales declined by 3.7 per cent, while production declined by 1.5 per cent in 1998.

Chemical, Petroleum, Rubber and Plastic Products

The chemical, rubber and plastic products industry continued to grow, with an 11 per cent increase in output in 1998. Both BOI industries and domestic market oriented industries in this sector grew appreciably. In pharmaceuticals, the high quality and lower prices of domestic products helped the domestic industry to maintain its advantage over imports. Improvements in quality, better packaging and aggressive advertising campaigns helped to increase the demand for consumer products such as detergents, soaps, cosmetics and toothpaste.

The expansion of construction activities in 1998 raised the demand for paints, varnish, PVC and chemical products. The plastic products industry grew as an ancillary industry, supplying packaging materials to the other growing industries and trade. In addition, the domestic production of plastic furniture also increased in 1998. The demand for ayurvedic drugs continued to increase during the year.

Other Products

The fabricated metal product category grew by 11 per cent. Despite the price competition in international markets, BOI manufacturers were able to sell their products in western markets due to the strong marketing links they had with major buyers. The domestic oriented industries, such as those manufacturing furniture and light engineering products, grew further in 1998. The increased substitution of steel based furniture for wooden

items due to the scarcity of supply and high price of wood helped the steel furniture industry. Similarly, in construction activity, the use of aluminum instead of wood for products such as door and window frames and partitions increased owing to advantages of price, durability and appearance. The output of building materials increased by 9 per cent in 1998. The demand for electrical items and cables also increased with the growth in construction activities. The manufacture of boats and boat repair activities continued to inert tse in 1998 owing to increased orders placed by the government. However, as in the previous year, the fabrication of motor coaches and lorries and the manufacture of bulbs declined owing to competition from imports.

The output of non-metallic mineral products increased by 5 per cent, a slightly higher rate than the 4.4 per cent in 1997. The output of processed diamonds, gems and diamond studded jewellery and some ceramic products continued to decline due to depressed demand for these products from the Asia-Pacific region. The output of cement, concrete works, terra-cotta products, ceramic products and asbestos roofing and ceiling sheets increased in 1998. The production capacity of the cement industry expanded in 1998. The growth in building construction increased the demand for asbestos, concrete products and ceramic products such as wall and floor tiles, mosaic wall tiles, sanitary ware and insulators. Productivity in the ceremic sector improved with the use of new machinery. The domestic sales of ceramic tiles increased with intensified sales promotion. Sri Lanka at present supplies less than 2 per cem. of the total requirement in the world market. There is substantial growth potential in this industry and attempts should be made to improve Sri Lanka's market share by improving its capacity to meet the requirements of a growing and competitive market.

The output of paper and paper products showed a significant growth owing to growing demand for printed materials, labels, exercise books and calendars, the increase in the circulation of newspapers and the introduction of new magazines. The expansion of other industries stimulated the

demand for labels, corrugated cartons and paper boxes. Despite

the increased supply of imported items, exercise book

production increased owing to the improvement of quality as

well as the price advantage over imported exercise books. The

output of the wood and wood product category showed a slight

decline in 1998, despite the total elimination of import duty on

timber in 1996. The export oriented manufacturers were not able

to reap the full benefit of this measure owing to increased

competition in the international market for wood products.

Although the domestic oriented wood products category

registered a moderate growth during the year, the growth

potential of the industry is severely constrained by the shortage

in the domestic supply of timber.

Public Sector Industries

The public sector industrial output grew by 16 per cent in 1998 compared to a contraction of 15 per cent in 1997. The higher growth reflected the contribution from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, which accounts for over 90 per cent of total public sector industrial output. The uninterrupted operation of the petroleum refinery resulted in an 18 per cent increase in the output of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in 1998. All public sector manufacturing enterprises, except Lanka Salt Ltd. and the National Paper Co. Ltd., have registered higher output levels during the year. Non-metallic mineral products registered the highest growth (30 per cent) followed by wood and wood products (23 per cent), chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products (18 per cent) and food, beverages and tobacco (5 per cent). However, production in the public sector paper and paper products category declined by 23 per cent.

With the establishment of latex collecting centers in rubber growing areas in 1997, the Sri Lanka Rubber Manufacturing and Exports Corporation Ltd. was able to purchase an increased volume of raw rubber, which enabled it to increase its output by 10 per cent in 1998. The output of the State Timber Corporation rose by 23 per cent. The Forest Department allocated more forest areas for felling operations during the year. The output of Sevanagala Sugar Industries Ltd. rose by 16 per cent in 1998, reflecting the increased supply of sugarcane. The area harvested

by the Sevenagala factory increased to 2,422 hectares in 1998

from 2,377 hectares in 1997, while the quantity of cane crushed

rose to 197,000 metric tons from 169,000 metric tons. The

output of Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd. rose by nearly 51 per cent

owing to the availability of more storage facilities and

uninterrupted production in 1998, compared to the previous year

in which production had been suspended for more than seven

months due to the security related problems in the East. The

output of Lanka Phosphate Ltd. increased by 24 per cent, mainly

due to growing demand for phosphate, particularly from the

domestic agricultural sector.

The output of Lanka Salt Ltd. declined by 22 per cent in

1998 mainly due to bad weather conditions. Output of the

National Paper Co. Ltd. declined by 23 per cent due to the

disruption to the power supply in the Valachchenai mill and the

frequent break down of machinery at Empilipitiya.

4.3 Value Added and Capacity Utilisation

The value added in the industrial sector increased in nominal

terms by 15.4 per cent in 1998 owing mainly to a reduction in

the cost of imported raw materials. Value added, in real terms,

increased by 7.5 per cent during the year. The value addition,

as a percentage of total value of production, increased marginally

to 37.5 per cent in 1998. The value added ratios in wood and

wood products, non metallic mineral products and fabricated

metal products were above 50 per cent. In the chemicals,

petroleum, rubber and plastic products it was 24 per cent. In

basic metal products it was 25 per cent. The value added ratios

were relatively high in food, beverages and tobacco products;

paper and paper products and other industrial products.

Domestic value addition in the textiles, wearing apparel and

leather products was 34 per cent. This has been increasing over

the last five years.

The installed capacity of the non-BOI industrial sector

expanded by a further 4.0 per cent in 1998. Benefitting from the

removal of import duties on machinery and equipment under the

Advanced Technology Incentive Programme and the

continuation of the policy of a lower National Security Levy (0.5

per cent), the non-BOI industries have imported a considerable

amount of machinery. As in the previous year, the highest capacity expansion (of 5.5 per cent) was in the textile, apparel and leather product sub sector. The installed capacity in many industrial categories showed improvements during the year. The major improvements were in food, beverage and tobacco products (3.9 per cent); paper and paper products (4.3 per cent); chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products (2.8 per cent); non-metallic mineral products (2.3 per cent) and basic metal products (3.1 per cent). The overall capacity utilisation ratio of the industrial sector remained unchanged at 84 per cent in 1998.

4.4 Cost of Production, Profitability and Employment

The average ex-factory profit ratio (profits as a percentage of ex-factory value of industrial production) of the 475 non-BOI firms declined from 14.9 per cent in 1997 to 12.5 per cent in 1998. This is due to the increase in cost of production as well as slow growth or decline in output prices. In absolute terms,

Sources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

wages, energy, raw material and other costs increased in 1998. The cost of imported raw materials as a percentage of total cost of production, declined marginally to 42.5 per cent in 1998 from 43.0 per cent in 1997. Many exporters had offered higher discounts to retain their export orders. The increase in the electricity cost following the imposition of GST also affected the profitability of the industrial sector. The profitability declined in many industrial categories during the year. Improvements in labour productivity in many industrial categories helped to avoid larger decline in profitability in the face of increased costs. The highest profitability was in the textile, apparel and leather product category (20.7 per cent). However, this was a decline from the 23.9 per cent in 1997. Profitability of the non-metallic mineral products category declined from 14.8 percent in 1997 to 9.4 percent in 1998. The profitability of the paper and paper products category improved from 10.9 per cent in 1997 to 11.5 per cent in 1998 owing to a reduction of cost.

The labour cost, as a percentage of total cost of production, declined slightly from 11.8 per cent in 1997 to 11.6 in 1998. The share of energy costs increased from 4.5 per cent in 1997 to 4.7 per cent in 1998. The energy cost, in nominal terms, increased by 24.2 per cent during the year. Energy formed the principal element in the total cost of production of non-metallic mineral products; wood and wood products and basic metal products. The share of energy in the total cost of production is low in food, beverage and tobacco products and paper and paper products. The proportion of expenditure on interest declined slightly in

1998, from 3.0 per cent in 1997 to 2.5 per cent in 1998. Some companies however had obtained capital for investment in new projects at comparatively high costs and this share of interest cost in the total cost of production was relatively higher.

Labour Productivity in Industry

The industrial production survey of the Central Bank of Sri

Lanka indicated an improvement of labour productivity by 4.1

per cent. Increases were seen in all major industrial categories.

Measures have been put in place to improve labour productivity.

These took the form of skills development programmes for

workers. Upgrading of machinery, improved work conditions

and improved management which have contributed to labour

productivity. The labour productivity improved in food, beverage and tobacco products (5.3 per cent); textile, apparel and leather product (3.7 per cent); non-metallic mineral products (5.0 per cent) and paper and paper products (3.1 per cent).

Employment in Industry

Employment in the industrial sector increased by 10.5 per cent in 1998, reflecting increased labour absorption in BOI and non-BOI industries. Employment in BOI industries increased by 14 per cent, while the employment in the non-BOI sector increased by 2.7 per cent. According to BOI sources, although employment opportunities for skilled labour were available in the export processing zones, the vacancies could not be filled due to shortage of workers with the required skills. Some industries were able to reduce their casual labour without affecting the production during the year. The introduction of capital intensive new technology also helped to reduce the less productive workers. Employment in the industrial categories of wood and wood products and fabricated metal products increased by over 7 per cent. Employment increases were also seen in food, beverage and tobacco products (3.4 per cent), textile, apparel and leather products (3.7 per cent), and basic metal products (4.5 per cent). There has been a reduction of employment in non-metallic mineral products by 2.3 per cent in 1998.

Foreign Investment

The international environment for foreign private investment in the Asian region remained depressed. Nevertheless, Sri Lanka continued to attract a slightly higher amount of foreign private investment in 1998. The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), which functions as the main government agency for the promotion of foreign investment, undertook several investment promotion missions, to the USA, India, Singapore, Germany,

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1998

Italy, Thailand and Belgium, in 1998. Business delegations from the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Confederation of Asia Pacific Chambers of Commerce visited Sri Lanka to search for new investment opportunities. Special missions from Australia, Germany and China also visited Sri Lanka to look for investment opportunities. The realised investment of the BOI industries increased by 17.6 per cent in 1998, from Rs. 27,375 million in 1997 to Rs.32,209 million in 1998.

The BOI, under Section 17 of the BOI Law, approved 400 new investment projects, as compared to 328 projects approved in the previous year. The total investment commitment of approved projects increased from Rs.73,607 million in 1997 to Rs. 158,107 million in 1998. Of the projects approved in 1998, 82 were entirely foreign owned, 108 were joint ventures and 210 were entirely domestically owned. The expected employment generation of these projects was estimated at 92,012 persons. The foreign component of these projects was about 72 per cent of the total approved investment in 1998. Australia, China, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and the USA were the source countries for this investment. Among the approved projects in 1998, 131 projects were in the textile, apparel and leather product category, 34 in the food, beverage and tobacco category and 25 in the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic product category, while the balance was in various other categories including services.

As in the previous year, the number of contracted projects also registered a considerable improvement. The BOI signed agreements in respect of 229 projects with an investment commitment of Rs.48,635 million in 1998 compared to 185 projects with an investment commitment of Rs 39*820 million in 1997. The foreign component was estimated at Rs.25,847 million or 53 per cent of the total investment of the contracted

investment component of these projects was estimated at

Rs.73,836 million or 62 per cent of the total investment. The

potential employment of these projects is estimated at 254,505

persons. By the end of 1998, there were 96 projects in the Export

Processing Zone (EPZ) in Katunayake, 58 in the Biyagama EPZ,

11 in the Koggala EPZ, 2 in the Mirigama EPZ, 4 in the

Malwatta Export Processing Park, 4 in the Kandy Industrial Park

and 752 enterprises outside the export processing zones, of

which most are in the garment sector.

During 1998, the BOI had approved 90 projects under

Section 16 of the BOI Law (normal Law). The total investment

commitment of these projects amounted to Rs.5,205 million,

while the foreign component was Rs.2,645 million or 50 per

cent. The estimated employment of these projects was 3,164

persons, compared to 4,046 persons in the projects approved in

the previous year. Of the total approved projects, 42 projects

were entirely foreign owned and 47 projects were joint ventures.

58

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1998

Under Section 16 of the BOI Law, 397 projects were in

commercial operation at end 1998. The total estimated

investment in these projects was Rs. 18,416 million, of which

Rs.9,689 million or 52 per cent was from foreign sources.

Local Investment

The domestic investment commitment of the 400 projects

approved under Section 17 of the BOI Law during 1998 was

Rs.44,122 million and accounted for 28 per cent of the total

investment commitment. The estimated local investment of the

projects that signed agreements in 1998 was Rs. 19,787 million

or 40 per cent of the total investment. The share of the local

investment in 927 commercially operated projects under the BOI

amounted to Rs.44,370 million or 38 per cent of the total

investment at end 1998. A significant portion of the investments

was in enterprises located outside the EPZs.

The total investment in 1,731 enterprises registered under

the Ministry of Industrial Development amounted to Rs. 89,728

million as at end 1998. The employment potential of these

industries is estimated at 292,841 persons. These investments

were mainly in the industrial categories of textile, apparel and

leather products; chemical, rubber and plastic products; food,

beverage and tobacco products and non-metallic mineral

products.

4.6 Availability of Credit to the Industrial Sector

The amount of credit available to the industrial sector from

commercial banks and long-term lending institutions increased

during the year. The National Development Bank (NDB) and

DFCC Bank continued to provide long-term financial facilities

in the form of direct loans and equity participation, while the

commercial banks provided mostly short-term financial facilities

as working capital. In addition, the NDB provided refinance

under the Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project

(SMAP), which was launched in 1997, using the funds raised

by the NDB jointly from foreign commercial sources and the

Asian Development Bank (ADB).

During 1998, the NDB and DFCC Bank together have

approved financial facilities amounting to Rs.22,016 million to

the industrial sector compared to Rs. 15,575 million approved in

1997, an increase of 41 per cent. The food, beverages and

tobacco product category and chemical, petroleum, rubber and

plastic products category received a large portion of these

financial facilities. Rs.3,864 million has been approved in

respect of 439 projects in the food, beverages and tobacco

category, while Rs.2,743 million has been approved in respect

of 277 projects in the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic

products category. During the first nine months of the year,

commercial banks provided credit facilities amounting to Rs.27

billion to the industrial sector, as against Rs.25 billion lent during

1997. The rate of growth of industrial credit granted by

commercial banks during the first three quarters of 1998 was

approximately 12 percent.

During the year, the NDB approved Rs. 1,336 million of

refinance under the SMAP in respect of 1,313 projects. Of this,

credit amounting to Rs.263 million was approved in respect of

225 projects in the food, beverages and tobacco products

category, Rs.170 million in respect of 127 projects in the

chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products category and

Rs.107 million in respect of 97 projects in the wood and wood

products category. The NDB provided equity finance amounting

to Rs. 1,229 million for 12 projects in 1998, compared to Rs.418

million for 8 projects last year. Of this Rs. 1,229 million, about

Rs.530 million was provided for 3 projects in the chemical,

petroleum, rubber and plastic products category. Direct financial

assistance remains the major source of industrial credit from the

NDB. During the year, the NDB approved Rs. 14,963 million

worth of direct financial assistance in respect of 809 projects,

(b) Projects and Equipment Finance Loans only up from Rs. 11,647 million approved in respect of 733 projects in the previous year. The amount of loans approved increased by 29 per cent over the previous year, while the number of projects approved increased by 10 per cent. A large number of projects in the food, beverages and tobacco products category and chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products category have absorbed a significant amount of this financial assistance.

The number of projects and the amount of credit approved by DFCC Bank increased considerably in 1998. During the year, DFCC Bank approved credit amounting to Rs.4,488 million in respect of 430 industrial projects compared to Rs.3,380 million approved in respect of 337 projects in 1997. Of the Rs.4,488 million, Rs. 1,559 million was approved in respect of 148 projects in the food, beverages and tobacco products category, Rs.1,039 million was approved in respect of 66 projects in the textiles, wearing apparel and leather products category and Rs.824 million was approved in respect of 53 projects in the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products category.

4.7 Industrial Policy

The main objectives of the industrial policy of the government are expansion, diversification and upgrading of the domestic industrial base, efficient management of physical and manpower resources, creation of new employment opportunities in both rural and urban sectors, export promotion and the promotion of industrialisation at the regional level. These objectives are expected to be achieved by making the macro economic environment conducive to rapid industrial growth, encouraging private sector participation, promoting direct foreign investment, facilitating the expansion of small and medium sector industries, promoting regional industrialisation, encouraging

commercialisation of research and development and promoting linkages between large and small firms.

A Presidential Trade and Tariff Commission was appointed to rationalise the existing tariff structure. The Commission recommended a reduction of the prevailing tariff rates and a move towards a two band tariff structure in two stages. The government Budget for 1999 also indicated that a two band tariff structure would be introduced in the year 2000. The standard duty rates of 10, 20 and 35 per cent were replaced with 5, 10 and 30 per cent, respectively. Accordingly, all imported industrial raw material and machinery were brought under a duty rate of 5 per cent. This measure is expected to reduce the cost of production and thereby enhance the competitiveness of Sri Lankan products.

The Presidential Trade and Tariff Commission has also recommended a complete review of the Customs Ordinance and systems and procedures to improve Customs administration. The improvement of the efficiency of the Customs would assist export oriented industries by way of timely delivery of finished products and quick access to raw materials, which are crucial to maintaining competitiveness in the global market. In this regard, the 1999 Budget proposed the appointment of a committee of experts from both the public and the private sector to undertake a complete review of the Customs Ordinance and systems and procedures. The 1999 Budget also proposed extending the servicing hours of Sri Lanka Customs and the Ports Authority without any additional cost to the exporters.

The government took several measures to improve industrial and social infrastructure facilities. The expansion of telecommunication services, power generation, port development, industrial parks and industrial townships are

expected to encourage industrial investment. In order to overcome the problem of a lack of skilled labour, the 1999 Budget proposed to set up a Skills Development Fund to encourage employers to conduct job entry training, upgrading and retraining of their employees, as well as to improve enterprise based training. In addition, measures are needed to make the labour market more flexible. This would include the introduction of necessary reforms to the existing labour laws, which are often viewed as discouraging private investment.

The duties on textiles and other related raw materials were abolished in the 1998 Budget to overcome the Customs related problems faced by the export oriented garment manufacturers who rely heavily on imported raw materials. Accordingly, the import of yarn, fabrics and all related intermediate and capital goods was made duty free from November 1997. This measure is expected to eliminate Customs delays, smuggling and under invoicing and also to reduce the lead time of exports. A 10 per cent Customs duty was imposed on imports of ready-made garments to encourage the domestic garment industry, while a restructuring programme for the textiles industry was launched to assist the industry to modernise its mills and to introduce new generation technology.

Incentives to the Industrial Sector

The fiscal incentives offered through the 1996 Budget were extended for a further period of two years in the 1998 Budget in order to encourage the use of advanced technology. This scheme offers duty free importation of approved machinery and equipment for new enterprises investing over Rs.4 million and Rs.l million for existing enterprises and a five year tax exemption on incremental profits. The minimum investment requirements relating to the importation of approved machinery and equipment were removed in the 1999 Budget with a view to encouraging small scale enterprises to acquire advanced technology. However, income tax concessions are extended only if the investment proposals are above the prevailing minimum level of investment. Under this scheme, approvals have been given for 142 new enterprises with a total investment commitment of Rs. 10,883 million, and for 378 existing enterprises with a total investment commitment of Rs.23,270 million as at end 1998. During this period, Rs.22,465 million worth of machinery and equipment has been imported under this scheme. The potential employment of these projects is estimated to be 31,771 persons.

With a view to encouraging private sector involvement in training facilities in priority sectors such as gems and jewellery, electronics, computer software and garments, the 1999 Budget proposed to amend the BOI incentives to grant a 5 year tax holiday, provided that each training institute undertakes training for a minimum of 300 persons. Prior to this amendment, the BOI provided a preferential tax rate of 15 per cent and a duty free facility to establish training facilities. It was also proposed to provide financial assistance to expand and improve existing training institutions and to establish new training facilities. The

proposed Skills Development Fund is expected to support employers to conduct job entry training, upgrading and retraining of their employees as well as to improve enterprise based training.

Following the recommendations made by the Development Review Committees of the Advisory Councils for Industry, certain industries such as electronics and components for assembling, ceramics and glassware, rubber based industries, light and heavy engineering, cutting and polishing of gems, diamonds and manufacture of jewellery were declared as 'thrust industries'. Special incentives were made available to promote such industries in 1998. New enterprises, which establish such industries in designated zones with a minimum investment of Rs.50 million, create 50 new employment opportunities and export over 90 per cent of output, are eligible for a 10 year tax holiday with other BOI incentives and concessions. Non-BOI enterprises that have already engaged in a thrust industry are permitted to import plant and machinery on a duty free basis to modernise existing factories. In addition to these duty free concessions, a 5 year tax holiday is granted to those enterprises which reach the 50 per cent export requirement within a period of 5 years, while a 10 year tax holiday and full BOI status would be granted to those enterprises which comply with the 90 per cent export requirement. Further, investors investing their undisclosed accumulated income in thrust industries were declared eligible for a tax/exchange control amnesty. Those engaged in the gold, gem and jewellery industry were also given a host of other incentives, including exemption from income tax and National Security Levy and duty free import of gems and gold.

The 'Restructuring Programme for the Textile Industry', introduced after the liberalisation of textile imports in 1998, is expected to encourage domestic textile manufacturers in introducing new generation technology to increase efficiency and competitiveness. A special fund known as the Textile Debt Recovery Fund was set up to transfer all outstanding loans, together with accrued interest of the textile manufacturers. Upon transferring the outstanding debt to the Fund the enterprises become eligible to obtain new financial assistance for modernisation and restructuring of the mills against the collateral/mortgage already furnished as security for previous loans. By end 1998, about 128 entrepreneurs had submitted applications to avail themselves of relief offered under this restructuring programme. Of these, 101 applications have been considered favorably and their total debt outstanding, amounting to Rs.3,781 million, has been transferred to the Textile Debt Recovery Fund (TDRF). Of the claims relating to these 101 entrepreneurs, five have already been finalised and the rest are being processed. The government has already paid Rs.204.2 million to the banks, (Rs.97.6 million principal and Rs. 106.7 million interest) in respect of the debts transferred to the TDRF. By the end of 1998, one entrepreneur had already undertaken a modernisation project and it is expected that more will start modernisation of their factories, once the relevant agreements

are signed. A full interest subsidy for those textile manufacturers who are classified as good customers of the banks was also introduced. These manufacturers were also allowed to import project related machinery, equipment, parts and inputs, including raw materials and accessories for the textile industry, on a duty free basis. The government has also decided to procure from these manufacturers the requirements of fabric materials for school uniforms, uniform requirements of service personnel and items such as bandages and gauze for the health sector and uniform requirements of the Postal and Railway Departments etc., commencing from January 1999, until their products reach the quality standards demanded by international markets. For the purpose of implementing this procurement plan, a Domestic Textile Allocation Committee (DTAC) has been set up in the Ministry of Industrial Development to assess the fabric requirements of government institutions and to identify the manufacturers eligible to receive these orders on a quota basis.

To promote regional industrialistion the government has also introduced an incentive scheme aimed at promoting geographical dispersion of industries. Accordingly, any BOI or non-BOI enterprise in commercial operation would be entitled to receive incentives offered by the BOI, provided that such enterprise sets up an expansion unit or relocates in a zone designated as a 'difficult area' or a 'most difficult area' before 31 December 1998, employs a minimum of 150 persons and exports a minimum of 50 per cent of the output. The minimum export requirement will be 90 per cent in the case of the garments industry. An enterprise in commercial operation setting up an expansion unit or relocating to 'difficult area' or a 'most difficult area' will be entitled to 5 year and 8 year tax holiday periods, respectively, along with other BOI incentives. It was also proposed to grant an additional 5 year tax holiday and other incentives to existing BOI enterprises currently located in difficult and most difficult areas for expansion at the same

location for the manufacture of garments, ancillary products or other related items for the garment industry and for setting up of specialised training centres in advanced technology, provided that such enterprises are commissioned before 31 December 1998 and the enterprise provides employment for a minimum of 100 persons. Although this incentive scheme was to expire in 1998, it has been extended till 31 December 1999, in the 1999 Budget.

National Productivity Decade Programme

The National Productivity Decade Programme, launched in 1997 with the objective of improving productivity in both the private and public sectors, continued in 1998. The year 1998 was considered an important year in the implementation of the productivity programme, in view of the emphasis placed on productivity improvement in the public sector, carrying the message of productivity to peripheral areas and formulating a strategic Five Year Plan for productivity improvement. The Five Year Plan aims to improve productivity in the public, private and non-corporate sectors through leadership improvement, human resource development, information technology (IT) improvement, improvement of utilisation of finances and introduction of reforms to rules, regulations and procedures. According to the Ministry of Industrial Development, the Five Year Plan will be implemented from 1999. The Ministry of Industrial Development paid special attention to popularising worker participation techniques and enhancing awareness on productivity themes among employees, manufacturers and the general public. Productivity cells have been set up in almost every ministry and liaison officers have been appointed to co­ordinate the productivity improvement activities of the respective ministries, departments and public sector organisations. Radio discussion programmes that stressed the need for awareness creation among the public on productivity

improvement themes were given priority. During 1998, 50 English programmes, 50 Sinhala programmes and 52 children's programmes were broadcast.

4.8 Industry Location

Many industrialists prefer to locate their factories in the Colombo and Gampaha districts, owing to the availability of relatively better infrastructure facilities in these districts and the close proximity to the sea and air port. The concentration of industries in these districts has created several economic and social problems, including congestion in the capital city, scarcity of labour for industries, environmental pollution and escalation of real estate prices. The government has taken several policy measures in the recent past to minimise excessive concentration of industries in these areas and to discourage migration of people to those areas for employment and investment purposes. The most important measures taken by the government in this regard include the introduction of the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme and the Fifty Garment Factory Programme, the establishment of mini Export Processing Zones or Parks in Kandy, Malwatta, Watupitiwala, and Mirigama, the introduction of the regional industrial parks, industrial estates and industrial township programme, the implementation of the Southern Development Programme and the provision of fiscal incentives to set up industries in designated difficult and most difficult areas of the country.

To overcome inadequate infrastructure facilities in the regions, the government launched the regional industrial parks programme. The Seethawaka Industrial Park established under this programme has completed its construction work in 1998 by providing infrastructure facilities such as factory buildings, access roads, electricity, water, telecommunication and waste disposal facilities. Selling of factory lots in the Seethawaka Industrial Park commenced in July 1998. The more environment friendly industries such as food processing, gems and jewellery, garments, electronic and electronic products, wooden furniture, rubber based industries and assembling of electronic components are encouraged in this park. A preliminary report on the construction of the Matugama Industrial Park, covering 300 acres, has already been prepared. State land, 105 acres in extent in Bata-atha in the Southern province, is being developed to set up an industrial park for the tanning industry, with the necessary infrastructure facilities including waste water disposal plant, chrome recovery units and a solid waste disposal system.

The BOI has taken steps to set up mini Export Processing Zones in Malwatta, Mirigama and Watupitiwala by providing

the required infrastructure facilities. The Malwatta mini EPZ will accommodate 11 industries, after completion of its construction work. The potential employment of this project is estimated at 5,000 persons. The Mirigama mini EPZ, extending over 40 hectares has a capacity for 15 industrial units. The first phase of the construction of this park is expected to be completed in mid 1999. The Watupitiwala mini EPZ consists of 27 hectares for 20 industrial plots.

Under the regional industrial estate development programme, construction work in twelve industrial estates at Homagama, Minuwangoda, Karandeniya, Beliatta, Pannala, Udukawa, Matale, Dankotuwa, Ampara, Kuruwita, Kalutara, and Thamankadawa commenced in 1997 and 1998. These parks will cover 324 acres and will have the capacity to accommodate around 225 industrial units. At end 1998,80 blocks of land had been allocated to potential investors and 17 industrial projects in these sites were in commercial operation, employing 3,460 persons. Setting up of 15 more industrial estates in the Kurunagala, Anuradhapura, Nuwara-Eliya, Ampara, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, Jaffna, Moneragala and Kandy districts was being considered. The total extent of land to be developed under this programme has been estimated at 335 acres. The envisaged employment opportunities in these industrial estates were estimated at 15,000 persons. The 1999 Budget also proposed to set up several 'Dedicated Economic Centres' in regions in order to promote economic activities giving more consideration to area specific problems. The construction of the Divulapitiya and Damdulla Dedicated Economic Centres commenced in 1998.

There were 160 garment factories registered under the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme in 21 districts at the end of the year. The location of these factories shows wide regional distribution with 138 factories or 86.2 per cent of the total of 160 factories being located in districts other than Colombo and Gampaha. There were factories in difficult districts such as Moneragala, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Ampara. Under this programme, the Ratnapura and Anuradhapura districts had 15 factories each, while the Puttalam and Kandy districts had 12 factories each. However, of the 1,274 enterprises registered under Section 16 and 17 of the BOI Law, 939 or 73 per cent were located in the Colombo and Gampaha districts. Of the 1,747 factories registered with Ministry of Industrial Development under the Industrial Promotion Act of 1990, 1,511 factories were also located in these two districts.
