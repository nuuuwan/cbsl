    "text": "Export of plantation crops increased by 10 per cent in 1997 and contributed to 20 per cent of the total as in 1996. In 1997, Sri Lanka regained its position as the world's largest tea exporter by overtaking Kenya. The export volume of tea increased by 10 per cent to 269 million kg. with tea production at a record level of 277 million kg. in 1997. Meanwhile tea prices increased by 6 per cent to US dollar 2.68 per kg. reflecting a supply shortage in the world tea market and a quality improvement in Sri Lanka's tea production. The value of tea exports rose by 17 per cent and contributed 15 per cent to total exports in 1997. Tea prices remained strong due to production shortfalls in Kenya, Indonesia, China and Bangladesh and increased world demand. Higher output in tea production in India and Sri Lanka was not sufficient to compensate for the sharp production drop in these countries. Rising demand from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Turkey, coupled with the improvement in the quality of Sri Lanka's",

    "text": "Being a small producer and exporter of rubber, accounting for only about 2 per cent of the world natural rubber market, Sri Lanka is a price taker in the international market for sheet rubber although it has a price advantage in certain grades of crepe rubber used in the manufacture of specialised articles such as surgical gloves, apparel and clothing accessories. The average export price of Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) rubber, which accounted for about 43 per cent of total exports, declined by 20 per cent in 1997. However, the average price of latex natural rose by 5 per cent owing to the high quality of this product, while crepe grades too recorded higher prices. All other grades of rubber recorded lower prices. Relatively lower prices of rubber in the East Asian countries have made imported rubber more attractive recently for Sri Lanka's domestic manufacturing industry. The existing import duty of 10 per cent and turnover tax of 20 per cent with the upliftment of import value by 25 per cent for turnover tax and national security levy of 4.5 per cent together provided some degree of effective protection for domestic rubber producers. Imports of latex rubber increased from 63,690 kg. in 1996 to 270,891",

    "text": "With a view to achieving high productivity, efficiency and expansion in economic activities by managing the trade and tariff policy in an effective manner, duty free facilities were made available by the 1998 Budget for several sectors to obtain raw material, plant and machinery. The textile and garment sector, which accounted for nearly 50 per cent of Sri Lanka's export earnings, spends more than 60 per cent of its earnings on importation of inputs. However, as more than 86 per cent of textile and garment imports hitherto were by the BOI enterprises on a duty free basis, the ratio of duty collection to total imports was as low as 0.8 per cent. The higher duty applicable to this sector was paid only, by non-BOI, mainly medium and small scale, industries. Therefore, in line with the present policy direction of rationlisation of the tariff structure to simplify and minimise anomalies, imports of yarn, fabrics and all related intermediate and capital goods were made duty free with effect from 6 November 1997. The complete removal of duty on this sector will reduce the work load of the Customs, simplify Customs procedures and eliminate Customs delays, corruption and smuggling.",

Meanwhile imports of seed cleaning, sorting and grading machines, seed testing equipment and seed packing machines were also made duty free. The tea manufacturing sector will also benefit by the removal of duty on tea packing machinery and colour separators. The transport sector was given high priority. In addition to the duty concessions provided in the 1997 Budget, importation of agricultural tractors, lorries and refrigerated trucks were made duty free to assist in marketing and goods transport. Items imported for manufacturing tractors and lorries were made duty free towards further strengthening this objective while encouraging local industries to produce these items in a competitive environment. Large commercial organisations were provided with a duty free facility to import buses and coaches for providing transportation to their employees.",

A marginal reduction in the machinery and equipment category was partly due to a duty waiver on generators effective from June 1996 to July 1997.",

    "text": "The performance based quota system continued in 1997 with priority given to new exporters and those who expanded their existing capacities, in allocating pool quotas. No major revisions in quota allocation took place in 1997. Quota availability to the USA, the EU and Canada rose by 5.6 per cent, 11.4 per cent and 0.9 per cent, respectively. As a result, overall quota availability increased by 6.2 per cent in comparison to the 13.5 per cent increase recorded in 1996. However, the overall quota utilisation rate declined to 65 per cent from 70 per cent in 1996 mainly due to weak demand for some quota categories. Meanwhile, a shift was also seen from low value added to high value added items. The utilisation of quotas varied widely across different categories and countries. To the USA market, quota availability and utilisation both increased significantly for certain items such as coats, trousers and play suits. To the same market, for other items such as night-wear, fabrics and suits for women, utilisation was higher than that in 1997 despite a lower quota allocation. Even though the quota availability was raised for items such as gloves, knitted blouses, shirts and shop towels, utilisation was much lower for those items. The quota utilsation rates for all items to the EU declined despite the rise in the available quota. With regard to the Canadian quota, only a few categories indicated satisfactory quota utilisation. The above performance was partly due to insufficient demand for some items which come under quota, indicating that an increase in quota availability also needed to be supported by demand for those items in those specific markets.",

The UK, which became the main single source of arrivals outnumbering Germany in 1996, continued to maintain its position in 1997. The substantial appreciation of the sterling pound against the Sri Lankan rupee which lowered the cost of vacationing in Sri Lanka for UK nationals may have led to this turnaround. Arrivals from Asia, the second largest source grew by 10 per cent. A growth in arrivals from most countries in the Asian region except Indonesia. Thailand and Pakistan, was seen. The lower arrivals from Indonesia and Thailand may be partly a reflection of the financial crisis in these countries. Arrivals from Australasia, North America and Eastern Europe too increased by 34 per cent, 28 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, increasing the diversification of tourist arrivals.",

The remainder were for purposes such as business and visiting friends and relatives. Reflecting the potential for the promotion of novel aspects of pleasure tourism such as eco-tourism and culture tourism, the revenue from foreign visitors who visited wild life parks, botanical gardens, zoological gardens and the cultural triangle continued to increase in 1997. The number of tourists who visited the zoological gardens grew by 35 per cent and earnings increased by 53 per cent in US dollar terms. Revenue received from visits to botanical gardens and wild life parks rose by 22 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively. The number of tourists visiting the cultural triangle grew by 40 per cent while the income from sale of tickets showed a 43 per cent increase, also due to an upward revision in prices of tickets by US dollars 2.50 to US dollars 32.50. The Sri Lanka Convention Bureau continued to promote meetings, incentive travel, conventions and exhibitions (MICE ) tourism in 1997. The number of tourists who visited under the MICE category grew by more than four fold over 1996 as the number of conferences and exhibitions held in 1997 had doubled.",
