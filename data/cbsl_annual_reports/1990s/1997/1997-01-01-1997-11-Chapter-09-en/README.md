9. TRADE, BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND TOURISM1

9.1 Overview

The balance of payments showed a significant

improvement in 1997 mainly reflecting increased exports,

services receipts, private transfers and higher capital and

financial inflows. With the recovery of economic activities

from the depressed conditions in the previous year, exports

grew faster than imports thereby narrowing the trade deficit

considerably. The services account registered a larger surplus

mainly due to the growth of tourism and port services.

Increased interest earnings reduced the net outflow on

account of investment income. Reflecting an improvement in

investor confidence there were higher capital inflows both

in terms of privatisation proceeds and foreign direct

investment. Meanwhile, the maintenance of some capital

controls, the low exposure to short-term foreign debt, the

flexibly managed exchange rate system, short-term monetary

policy reform through a higher repurchase rate and enhanced

surveillance of financial market activity helped to avoid the

contagion effect o f the East Asian crisis on Sri Lanka's

financial markets. Accordingly, a lower trade deficit, a

significantly lower current account deficit, a respectable

surplus in the overall balance and a relatively stable foreign

exchange market were the highlights of the external sector

developments in 1997.

, On the external policy front, Sri Lanka continued with

further cautious liberalisation of the capital account and

rationalisation of the trade regime. In January, commercial

banks were permitted to grant foreign currency loans to all

direct and indirect exporters either through their domestic or

foreign currency banking units, subject to a limit on net

foreign exposure of commercial banks. Hitherto, the foreign

loan facility had been available mainly to BOI exporters for

imported inputs. Further moves were also made in the tax

and tariff system to remove anomalies and facilitate the shift

to a Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 1998. The 'managed

floating exchange rate regime was maintained; with a 2 per

cent band between the Central Bank's buying and selling

rates, allowing the currency to depreciate gradually keeping

in mind the need to minimise erratic movements in the

exchange rate. The annual average real effective exchange

rate showed some appreciation in 1997 reflecting the sharp

depreciation of East Asian currencies during the second half

of 1997. This indicator alone may not reveal the complete

picture with regard to the external competitiveness of Sri

Lankan products, particularly given the inflationary impact

of the large depreciation of East Asian currencies, which is yet to be seen.

The resilience displayed by the external sector in the

previous year amidst difficult conditions was strengthened in

1997, with a rapid recovery in the economy. Exports

increased by 13 per cent while imports grew by 8 per cent.

Reflecting favourable prices for exports and declining prices

on imports, the terms of trade improved by 4.2 per cent. As

a result, the trade deficit narrowed, for the third consecutive

year, from 10 per cent of GDP in 1996 to 8 per cent in

1997. The net service receipts increased by 51 per cent due

to a strong recovery in the tourist industry and expansion

of port related activities. Net factor income outflows declined

by US dollars 38 million as there were higher inflows on

account of interest earnings in respect of external assets

invested abroad. Net current transfers increased by 10 per

cent due to higher receipts from private transfers partly on

account of compensation payments to Sri Lankan workers'

who were displaced from Kuwait by the Gulf war in 1990.

The current account deficit of the balance of payments

declined.sharply to 2.5 per cent of GDP in 1997 or US

dollars 387 million from 4.9 per cent of GDP or US dollars

683 million in 1996 continuing its downward trend for the

third consecutive year.

Net private investment inflows increased substantially

from US dollars 221 million to US dollars 341 million due

mainly to privatisation proceeds. Foreign funds received by

the National Development Bank (NDB) for its lending

activities and foreign sale o f NDB shares and 35 per cent

of the shares of Sri Lanka Telecom, totalling US dollars 376

million, were the major sources of foreign private capital

inflows to the country in 1997. Despite an increase in short-

term trade credits of the private sector, net short-term

liabilities declined as there was an increase in the net

external assets of commercial banks in the context of

declining domestic interest rates. The Government

successfully raised US dollars 50 million through a Floating

Rate Note issue in the international capital market after 15

years. However, net official capital inflows declined by about

35 per cent during the year due to weak utilisation of foreign

aid and higher outpayments. Net capital transfers, too

declined by 9 per cent due to a reduction in project grants.

The overall balance of the balance of payments registered a

healthy surplus of US dollars 163 million according to the

BPM5 during 1997. Gross official external assets at US

Part I Central Bank .of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Prusi-iifutimi of BOP Statist its according to the Fifth (1993) Edition of the IMF BOP Manual and External Sector Data in US Dollars

The Balance of Payments t.BOP) statistics of Sri Lanka have hitherto been published according to the Fourth (1977) Edition format of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM4) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Moreover, the BOP data as well as all other external sector data of Sri Lanka have been published by the Central Bank in Sri Lanka rupees and Special Drawing Rights (SDR). Henceforth, the Central Bank will i) publish the BOP statistics according to the Fifth (1993) Edition format of the Balance Payments Manual (BPM5); and ii) present external scctoi data in L'S dollars instead ol" SDRs. The rationale for this change as well as the major differences in presentation in the proposed new foimat are discussed in the remainder of this article

I. Presentation of BOP Statistics According to BPMS

With the publication ol the revised (Filth Edition) Balance of Payments Manual by the IMF in 1993. all member countries arc expected to publish their BOP statistics in accordance with the new foimat intioduv.cd in the manual. The salient features of the changes between the BPM4 and the BPM5 had been published in Box 9 of the Central Bank Annual Report of J 99b. The majoi changes as they would appear in the text and Statistical Appendix tables of the Annual Kepoit arc as follows:-

1. The former Services account will be divided into two separate sectors . i.c. die Sen ices scctoi consisting of trade m seivices and the Income sectot which would consist of compensation of employees statistics and investment income (profits, dividends and interest). The Fieight and Merchandise Insurance item shown in the old format wijl be disaggregated and Freight will be shown separately in the new format. Merchandise Insurance together with Non-meichandise Insurance, fornicily shown undei "Otlici Services", will be shown a& Insurance Services in the new format.

2. Transfers will be divided into Current Transfers and Capital Translers. Cuirent transfers will consist oi migrants' current transfers and non-project grants and will form part of the current account, while capital transfers consisting of project grants and migrants' capital transfers will be in the capital account,

3. The present Non-monctaiy sector will be redesignated as the Capita] and Financial Account

4. The commcicial banks assets and liabilities which were hitherto included in the Monetary sector and were taken into considctation when computing the country"s overall balance in the balance of payments will be shifted to the new Financial Account as part of shoit-tcrm capital.

5. As .i result of the shift of commercial bank assets and liabilities to the Financial Account mentioned in 4

above, the overall balance in the balance of payments will show the change in net official reserves (i.c. assets held by the Central Bank and the Government) only.

These changes in format are in keeping with changes [hat have taken place over time in the nature of international financial transactions and are therefore relevant and timely. Moreover, the changes will enable' comparison of Sri Lanka's BOP statistics with the rest of the world in the future,

II. Publication of External Sector Data in US Dollars

During the sixties and early seventies external sector data were published, when; necessary, in US dollars in addition to Sri Lanka rupees. Even after the establishment ol the SDR in 1970 the same practice was continued as the US dollar and SDR were on par. However, with the dc facto devaluation of the US dollar in 1971 and devaluation proper in 1973, the US dollar remained devalued in terms of the SDR. As the SDR, which repiesentcd a basket of major currencies, was considered to be a more stable unit of account and a reserve asset, the IMF expectation at that time was thai the SDR would become one of the leading icsecve assets in the world economy, in time

Although the SDR is still used as the unit of account ol the IMF. it has not icceivcd the prominence among reserve assets in the global economy as emisaged. In spite of the relatively high volatility of the US dollar compared to the SDR. the US dollar enjoys a prestigious position among the world's key currencies and accounts for the largest shaie of world trade and unestmcnt. In Sii Lanka too. US dollar denominated trade transactions account for about 75 pci cent of the total. The IMF itself has leverted to presenting external sector data in US dollais. The 1MF\ Balance of Payments Ycai Book, which formerly presented individual country data in SDRs. now presents those data in L'S dollar terms. The data presented in US dollars arc easily understood by most users.

Considering the above, it is advisable to publish external sector data in US dollars. Such a change for Sri Lanka would facilitate comparison of data with other countries of the world. However, it should be noted that the presentation of external scctoi data in a single currency would reflect the volatility of cross currency changes more than m a presentation in SDR which icprcscnLs a basket ot currencies that is far more stable against cioss currency fluctuations. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate to follow world trends tor data presentation and publishing. Hie 1997 Annual Report of the Central Bank will thcieloie present all external sector statistics in US dollars as a staning point to this change of presentation in the Annual

Industrial exports, dominated by textiles and garments, have become far more important over the last two decades in the composition of Sri Lanka's exports. In 1997, industrial exports accounted for 74 per cent of total exports as against 14 per cent in 1977. Earnings grew shaiply by 14 per cent in 1997 compared to a moderate 5 per cent in 1996. Textiles and garments grew by 20 per cent. The unit price of textiles and garments increased by 8 per cent, partly attributable to

quality improvements. The volume of garment exports

increased by 11 per cent in comparison to 4 per cent in

1996, reflecting mainly the recovery from the setback in

1996. Textile and garment exports continued to be the

leading export sub-category, contributing 66 per cent to total

industrial exports in 1997. Nearly 90 per cent of textile and

garment exports were by BOI companies. Export earnings

of BOI enterprises increased by 18 per cent, while those of

non-BOI enteiprises rose by 34 per cent partly reflecting the

relatively higher adverse impact of last year's power cuts on

the latter category. Net foreign exchange earnings from this

sub sector increased by 21 per cent over the previous year

reflecting higher domestic value addition. Of the earnings

from this sub sector, garments, the major contributor, which

accounted for 90 per cent, increased by 21 per cent, while

textiles grew by over 11 per cent. The textile and garment

industry benefited from the duty waiver granted on the

import of yarn in March 1997 and the removal of turnover

tax on yarn used in the handloom industry in April 1997.

In addition, a package of incentives was introduced in the

1998 Budget announced in November 1997 making all

intermediate and capital goods used in the textile and

garment industry non-dutiable.

The value of petroleum product exports declined by 7

per cent in 1997, with a 19 per cent decline in volume, due

to the temporary closure of the refinery for maintenance

purposes from 15 January to 2 March.

Reflecting further diversification of industrial exports,

machinery, mechanical and electrical equipment exports

increased by 32 per cent, mainly due to a growth in the

exports of parts and accessories for office machines such as

word processing and data processing machines and floppy

disks, electrical transformers, static converters and parts,

electric filament and discharge lamps, machine tools,

weighing machines and electric generating sets. Export

earnings of this category almost tripled during the last five

years raising its sectoral share in total industrial exports to

6 per cent.

Rubber based products increased by 5 per cent despite the severe competition experienced in the international markets during the latter part of the year owing to the East Asian financial crisis, and accounted for about 5 per cent of total industrial exports. Export volumes of rubber based products such as tyres, non-surgical gloves, floor covering and mats, and some forms of vulcanised rubber increased substantially. Earnings from surgical gloves remained at the. same level as in the previous year while exports of inner-tubes of tyres declined by 18 per cent. Within this sub sector, surgical and other gloves together accounted for 43 per cent, while tyres and tubes accounted for 41 per cent.

Export earnings from the food, beverages and tobacco

sub sector declined by 5 per cent owing to an 11 per cent

drop in the earnings from crustaceans and molluscs, which

contributed 56 per cent to this sub category. The outbreak

132

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

of the White Spot disease in major producing areas since late

1996 and increased salinity of water in prawn farms near the

Negombo lagoon resulted in the closure of several prawn

farms. However, a recovery of the industry was seen in the

last quarter of 1997 after the disease was contained. Shrimp

feed was made duty free with effect from August 1996 as

a relief measure to shrimp farmers.

. There was a marked reduction in jewellery (52 per cent)

and diamond (20 per. cent) exports due to lower demand.

This was largely due to the major setback in the Japanese

market resulting from the closure of two major jewellery

companies in Japan. The increase in sales tax in Japan in

1997 and the financial crisis in East Asia, where major

markets for diamonds and jewellery existed, were other

factors responsible for this reduction. Diamond exports to

Belgium, the largest market for Sri Lanka, declined by 18

per cent due to lower demand for their exports from the

depressed Japanese and East Asian markets. In addition to

the duty free facility granted in 1996 for precious metal for

the manufacture of jewellery for export, the import of gems

and gold was made duty free while the gem and jewellery

industries were exempted from income tax and the national

security levy from November 1997 with a view to

encouraging the industry.

Other manufactured exports that showed increases were

leather and footwear (32 per cent), table ware (9 per cent),

wall tiles (14 per cent) and plastics (28 per. cent). Earnings

from chemical products declined marginally, while wood

products dropped substantially with a significant decline in

many categories, including wooden jewellery cases, due to

lower demand.

Plantation Crops

Export of plantation crops increased by 10 per cent in 1997 and contributed to 20 per cent of the total as in 1996. In 1997, Sri Lanka regained its position as the world's largest tea exporter by overtaking Kenya. The export volume of tea increased by 10 per cent to 269 million kg. with tea production at a record level of 277 million kg. in 1997. Meanwhile tea prices increased by 6 per cent to US dollar 2.68 per kg. reflecting a supply shortage in the world tea market and a quality improvement in Sri Lanka's tea production. The value of tea exports rose by 17 per cent and contributed 15 per cent to total exports in 1997. Tea prices remained strong due to production shortfalls in Kenya, Indonesia, China and Bangladesh and increased world demand. Higher output in tea production in India and Sri Lanka was not sufficient to compensate for the sharp production drop in these countries. Rising demand from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Turkey, coupled with the improvement in the quality of Sri Lanka's

tea under private sector management contributed to higher

tea prices throughout 1997 and this is likely to continue,

reflecting one of the benefits of replacing state involvement

by the private sector, in economic activities in which the

private sector can perform better.

In the composition of Sri Lanka's tea exports, more

than 49 per cent was in bulk form, while 36 per cent was

in packed form. Tea bags, Sri Lanka tea blended with

foreign teas and instant and green tea accounted for the

remainder - less than 15 per cent of the total. As in the

previous year, the CIS countries, which continued to be the

prime destination for Sri Lanka's tea, accounted for 23 per

cent of exports, while Turkey remained the second largest

importer accounting for 13 per cent. The other major buyers

were U.A.E (7 per cent), Syria (5 per cent), Egypt, Jordan

and Libya (4 per cent each).

Export earnings from rubber declined by 24 per cent

owing to lower prices (11 per cent) and a decline in exports

volumes by 15 per cent. International rubber prices had

already declined by 12 per cent between December 1996 and

June 1997, even before the East Asian currency turmoil.

Production surpluses in major producing countries, such as

Thailand and Indonesia and the release of stocks led to lower

prices. Sharp currency depreciations in Thailand (46 per

cent), Indonesia (57 per cent) and Malaysia (35 per cent),

which contribute more than 85 per cent of world rubber

exports, also exerted downward pressure on international

rubber prices during the latter part of the year. Rubber

production was also adversely affected by heavy rains in the

last quarter of 1997.

Being a small producer and exporter of rubber, accounting for only about 2 per cent of the world natural rubber market, Sri Lanka is a price taker in the international market for sheet rubber although it has a price advantage in certain grades of crepe rubber used in the manufacture of specialised articles such as surgical gloves, apparel and clothing accessories. The average export price of Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) rubber, which accounted for about 43 per cent of total exports, declined by 20 per cent in 1997. However, the average price of latex natural rose by 5 per cent owing to the high quality of this product, while crepe grades too recorded higher prices. All other grades of rubber recorded lower prices. Relatively lower prices of rubber in the East Asian countries have made imported rubber more attractive recently for Sri Lanka's domestic manufacturing industry. The existing import duty of 10 per cent and turnover tax of 20 per cent with the upliftment of import value by 25 per cent for turnover tax and national security levy of 4.5 per cent together provided some degree of effective protection for domestic rubber producers. Imports of latex rubber increased from 63,690 kg. in 1996 to 270,891

133

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

kg. in 1997. However, it was only a small fraction ( 3 per

cent) of local production.

Exports of coconut kernel products increased by 2 per

cent. Higher production due to favourable weather conditions

generated.an exportable surplus of coconut kernel products.

Exports of other coconut products (coir products, shell

products etc.) also increased by 20 per cent in 1997. The

average price of major coconut exports declined in 1997 by

4 per cent.

from this category. Exports of all other agricultural products

except betel leaves and other oil seeds, recorded increases.

Export quantities of cinnamon, cloves, pepper, arecanuts and

cardamoms grew significantly due to increased production

resulting from favourable weather conditions. Prices of

pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg and mace increased due mainly

to improved demand from India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Saudi

Arabia. Export prices of essential oils too rose substantially

due to higher prices of cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg and

mustard oil.

Other Agricultural Products Mineral Products

Exports of other agricultural products increased by 10

per cent and contributed to 3 per cent of total exports in

1997 despite a decline in export earnings from un­

manufactured tobacco. Meanwhile, earnings from cinnamon

exports rose by 34 per cent, benefiting from increased prices

and higher volumes. These two products contributed 56 per

cent to the total earnings from other agricultural products.

Earnings from the fresh and dried fruit category declined by

32 per cent. Reduced earnings were due to low prices despite

a four fold volume increase of tamarind exports, largely

exported to Pakistan, which accounted for 70 per cent of the

total volume of fresh and dried fruits. The volume of other

fruit exports declined, contributing to the lower earnings

The export earnings from all mineral products decreased

by 6 per cent and contributed 2 per cent to exports in 1997

owing to lower earnings from precious and semi precious

stones (3 per cent). Within this sector 'geuda' exports were

adversely affected by the reduced participation of Thai

buyers in the gem trade due to the financial crisis in

Thailand. From the supply side, gem mining was adversely

affected by the dispute between the Gem and Jewellery

Authority and plantation companies, in respect of sharing

proceeds from the auctioning of leases of lands under the

plantation companies for mining. Since this dispute has not

been settled, the reduction in legal mining in 1997 would

be reflected in future gem exports. Precious stone export

volumes declined, although marginally, in 1997, as against

a 20 per cent increase in 1996. Earnings from other mineral

exports fell by 33 per cent due to lower earnings from

metallic ores and iron pyrites and other mineral product

exports. However earnings from ilmenite and natural graphite

grew, containing the decline in the mineral sector export

earnings.

9 3 Imports

.Total outlay on imports, at US dollars 5,852 million,

registered a moderate growth of 8 per cent, compared With

3 per cent in 1996. Imports of intermediate goods grew by

11 per cent while those of investment goods grew by 10 per

cent. Imports of consumer goods declined by 1 per cent, due

to lower outlay on rice, wheat and milk imports. As in the

case of the export structure, the import structure too has

changed drastically over the last two decades shifting from

the import of consumer goods to more development-oriented

intermediate and investment goods. The share of investment

and intermediate goods imports as a percentage of total

imports had risen from 56 per cent in 1977 to. 75 per cent

in 1997.

Consumer Goods

Within the consumer goods category, imports of food

and drink declined by 2 per cent reflecting mainly the partial

recovery in rice production, while non-food consumer goods

imports increased by 2 per cent reflecting improved domestic

demand for consumer durable goods. Expenditure on rice

imports dropped by 20 per cent in 1997 due to a reduction

in the quantity as well as lower prices. The improved harvest

in 1997 enabled a 10 per cent quantity reduction over 1996.

During the year, 306,101 metric tons of rice were imported

at a cost of US dollars 73 million to meet the additional

demand not met by domestic production. Reduction in

international prices by 11 per cent and the removal of the

full duty waiver on rice on 30 January 1997, which had been

effective for a nine and half month period from mid-April

1996, also contributed to lower the import outlay. The

volume of wheat imports too declined by 14 per cent to

789,027 metric tons, while 10,674 metric tons of wheat flour

were imported to meet a temporary shortage in the domestic

market. The lower import of wheat reflected a drop in

domestic demand due to the removal of the subsidy on

wheat flour resulting in an increase in the retail price of

wheat flour from Rs.l3.95 per kg. to Rs.l6.95 per kg. on

27 August 1996 and further to Rs.l 8.95 per kg. on 10

August 1997. The outlay on milk and milk products declined

by 12 per cent due to lower prices. The quantity of sugar

imports increased by 43 per cent to 545,000 metric tons to

supplement the shortfall in domestic production, which fell

by 14 per cent, and to meet the increased demand. A duty

waiver of 17 per cent, which came into effect from 27

November 1996 for ten months, and a 10 per cent duty

waiver that was effective thereafter, together with the

withdrawal of turnover tax on sugar with effect from 6

November 1996 contributed to higher imports. International

prices of sugar declined by 11 per cent in 1997. All other

food imports increased by 15 per cent, with substantial

increases in imports of dried and other fish, potatoes and big

onions. The increases in potato and big onion imports are

attributable to the removal of the licensing requirement in

July 1996 and duty waivers introduced from 4 December

1996 to 31 January 1997 when supply shortages occurred.

In the durable consumer goods category, imports of

motor cars and motor cycles continued to decline in 1997,

while imports of radio receivers and television sets showed

an increase of 7 per cent. Medical and pharmaceutical

products increased marginally due to higher prices, in spite

of the drop in the import volume of medicaments indicating

135

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

the higher utilisation of locally produced items. Other

consumer durable imports that increased during 1997 were

articles of plastic, printed matter, electrical home appliances,

florescent lamps and clothing accessories.

Intermediate Goods

Imports of intermediate goods grew by 11 per cent, a

growth similar to the average annual increase in imports

during the previous three years, reflecting substantial

increases in imports of refined petroleum products (58 per

cent) and textiles (19 per cent). However, fertiliser imports

declined sharply for the second consecutive year due to

lower international prices and reduced application of

fertiliser. The substantial increase in refined petroleum

product imports was largely due to the higher volume that

had to be imported for thermal power generation as well as

to meet the supply shortfall resulting from the routine

temporary closure of the refinery mentioned earlier. Crude

oil imports declined by 10 per cent also due to the closure

of the refinery. A partial duty waiver of 10 per cent was

granted on crude oil, petrol and diesel and a full waiver on

LP gas with effect from 15 January 1997 as a relief measure

in the face of high international prices in the early part of

the year. On average, however, annual crude oil prices

declined from US dollars 20.19 per barrel in 1996 to US

dollars 19.42 in 1997. In line with the growth in the textile

and garment industry, textile imports increased by 19 per

cent. Of the total textile imports, the BOI companies

accounted for 86 per cent. Reflecting the setback in the

diamond industry, diamond imports declined by 20 per cent

in 1997. Among other intermediate goods, paper and

paperboards (10 per cent), dyeing, tanning and colouring

materials (14 per cent), unmanufactured tobacco (62 per cent)

and palm oil (33 per cent) recorded increases.

Investment Goods

Imports of investment goods rose by 10 per cent in 1997 showing an improvement in the domestic investment climate. The growth in investment goods was largely due to increases in the import of machinery and equipment (14 per cent), transport equipment (17 per cent) and building materials (3 per cent). Increases in the import of machinery and equipment were observed in almost all sub-categories, with more pronounced growth recorded in the irhports of telecommunication machinery, equipment and parts such as cellular telephones and other transmission apparatus for radio telephony and telegraphy reflecting a fast expansion in telecommunication services in the country. Higher imports were also seen of machines and parts used in the textile and garment industry for winding, weaving, knitting and sewing; industrial washing machines and tools; air and vacuum pumps; air conditioners; office equipment and parts, mainly

for data processing; and machinery for filling, sealing,

packing and labelling. The full duty waiver extended to

diesel power generators in June 1996 was in effect till mid

July 1997. There were further imports of 3,060 diesel power

generators worth US dollars 32 million. However, generators

and electrical transformers to the value of US dollars 18.5

million and US dollars 6.2 million were re-exported in 1997.

Higher imports of transport equipment were reflected in

imports of passenger buses and other goods transport

vehicles such as lorries and bowsers largely due to the

decline in duty on diesel engines and other parts and

accessories of passenger and goods transport vehicles since

November 1996.

9.4 Services and Income

The services account registered a significant

improvement during 1997. Reflecting relatively larger growth

of receipts vis-a-vis that of payments, the-surplus in the

services account rose by 51 per cent to US dollars 159

million in 1997. Service receipts increased by 14 per cent

owing to a turnaround in receipts from tourism, which

registered a 25 per cent growth, and increased earnings from

port services and passenger fares. The tourist industry

recovered in 1997 to register a net receipt of about US

dollars 29 million. Despite the terrorist attack in the Colombo

city in October 1997 tourist arrivals increased by 21 per cent

in 1997. Earnings from tourism grew by US dollars 42

million during the year.

The receipts from transportation services rose by 15 per

cent reflecting the incteases in receipts from passenger fares,

freight and other port related services. Increase in air fares

by the national carrier and a marked increase in tourist

arrivals contributed to higher receipts from passenger fares

while a record volume of trans-shipment cargo handled (26

per cent increase in volume) and growth in other cargo

handling led to higher inflows from freight and other port

related services.

The income category, which consists mainly of interest

income, foreign direct investment income and compensation

to employees according to the BPM5 presentation, grew by

25 per cent during the year, reversing the decline in 1996.

Among the major contributory factors for the higher interest

income inflows were the securities and foreign exchange

trading profits of the Central Bank which more than doubled

between 1996 and 1997. A drop in interest payments in US

dollar terms by US dollars 5 million on account of medium

and long-term loans of the Government, mainly as a result

of the appreciation of the dollar against the yen and the

SDR, also had a positive impact on the net income outflows

during the year. Outflows on account of profits and

dividends increased by 20 per cent during the year owing

to the higher investment stock following high inflows in the

recent past. In summary, net income outflows in dollars

terms declined from US dollars 204 million to US dollar 166

million during 1997.

95 Current Transfers

Net current transfers rose by 10 per cent entirely due

to private transfer receipts, which increased by 11 per cent

during the year. The latter growth mainly reflected the

receipt of US dollars 64 million as compensation payments

to employees at the rate of US dollars 2,500 per worker

received by 26,101 Sri Lankan workers who were displaced

from Kuwait during the Gulf war in 1990. Meanwhile,

private transfer payments grew by 10 per cent. As a result,

net private transfers increased by 11 per cent to US dollars

787 million in 1997 which was sufficient to finance 65 per

cent of the deficit in the goods, services and income account

compared with 49 per cent coverage in 1996. Official current

transfers, consisting mainly of food and commodity grants,

declined by 10 per cent in 1997. Japan (31 per cent)

continued to be the major donor, while the World Food

Programme (15 per cent), Sweden ( 13 per cent) and

Australia ( 10 per cent) also made noteworthy contributions

during the year.

9.6 Capital Movements

In 1997. capital and financial flows increased by 6 per

cent mainly due to privatisation proceeds of US dollars 301

million and increases in both private short-term and long-

term investment inflows. Foreign direct investment and the

Floating Rate Note (FRN) issues of the Government and a

development bank also contributed to the capital inflows

during the year. As a result, after netting out the increases

in net foreign assets of commercial banks, the overall

balance of the balance of payments reflected a surplus of US

dollars 163 million in 1997 against a deficit of US dollars

68 million in the previous year, thereby improving the net

official assets of the country.

Capital Transfers

Net capital transfers declined by US dollars 9 million

due to a 10 per cent drop in official project grants as a result

of a lower utilisation of concessional assistance. Japan (48

per cent), Norway (26 per cent) and the United States of

America (14 per cent) continued to be the major donors

during the year.

Long-Term Capital

Long-term capital inflows almost doubled during 1997.

With the decline in outflows due to a drop in amortisation

payments in respect of private long-term loans, net longrterm

137

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

private capital inflows increased from US dollars 123 million

to US dollars 491 million during the year largely due to

privatisation proceeds. The divestiture of a 35 per cent

government stake in Sri Lanka Telecom to Nippon Telegraph

and Telephone Corporation (NTT) of Japan in August and

the sale of debentures of the National Development Bank

held by the Government, raised US dollars 225 million and

US dollars 73 million, respectively.

Meanwhile, long-term loan capital to the private sector

declined by 3 per cent. Major disbursements took place on

account of long-term loan contracts by Sri Lanka Telecom

(US dollars 37 million) to finance a series of projects for

the installation of 150,000 new telephone lines and to the

National Development Bank (NDB) (US dollars 28 million)

along with the Floating Rate Notes, (guaranteed by the Asian

Development Bank) issued by the NDB for US dollars 50

million in the international capital markets to expand their

long-term lending activities in Sri Lanka. This was supported

by lending to BOI enterprises by FCBUs and by non-FCBU

sources during the year. The year also witnessed a decline

in long-term capital outflows due to a decline in amortisation

payments by US dollars 50 million following the

extraordinary loan repayments in 1996 on account of two

hotel projects and Air Lanka. This resulted in an increase

in net long term private loan capital inflows by US dollars

58 million during the year.

The investment friendly macro-economic environment

throughout the year appeared to have lent support to build

foreign investor confidence. Foreign direct investment inflows

are estimated at US dollars 133 million during the year

which reflected an increase of 34 per cent over the previous

year. Investment outflows of US dollars 5 million took place

for four investment projects overseas approved on a case-

by-case basis by the authorities in keeping with the cautious

policy of liberalisation of the capital account.

At the disaggregated level, telecommunication (over US

dollars 75 million), garments (over US dollars 17 million)

and power generation (over US dollars 17 million) were the

major sectors which attracted foreign investment through the

BOI, through both equity and loans, in 1997.

Meanwhile, long-term capital inflows to the Government

declined by 8 per cent due to the combined effect of a drop

in long-term concessional assistance by 22 per cent to US

dollars 333 million and an increase in long-term non-

concessional borrowings to US dollars 88 million during the

year. Japan (36 per cent), the Asian Development Bank (29

per cent), and the International Development Association (

24 per cent) continued to be the major sources of

concessional assistance to Sri Lanka during the year. The

drop in concessional assistance to the Government as a result

of lower utilisation, was partially offset by a successful

launch of the Floating Rate Note issue for US dollars 50

million by the Government in the international capital market

at a very attractive rate of LIBOR plus 1.5 per cent. This

issue, which was meant to raise funds for infrastructure

development, also aimed at establishing a bench mark rate

for foreign borrowing and laying the foundation for a

sovereign rating for Sri Lanka. This, together with a USAID

funded Housing Guarantee Loan of US dollars 15 million

. resulted in a significant increase in total long-term non-

concessional capital inflows to the Government. Despite

higher repayments the outcome was a decline in net outflows

of non-concessional long-term capital from US dollars 66

million in 1996 to US dollars 42 million in 1997.

Short-term Capital

Net short-term liabilities declined by US dollars 150

million during 1997 reflecting mainly the improvement in net

foreign assets held by commercial banks (International

transactions of commercial banks are treated as short-term

financial transactions in the capital account of the balance

of payments under the new BPM5 format. These had been

treated as monetary sector transactions under the BPM4

format). The decline in interest rates on domestic assets and

the uncertainty created by the East Asian currency turmoil

prompted commercial banks to sharply reduce their external

net liability position by portfolio adjustments towards foreign

assets. Foreign assets held by commercial banks, mainly in

the form of time deposits, rose by US dollars 290 million,

which was US dollars 200 million more than the increase

in foreign liabilities during 1997.

Net private short-term capital inflows increased by US

dollars 12 million, reflecting higher trade credits to the

export sector. The policy decision to allow commercial banks

to lend in foreign currency to non-BOI exporters received

only a moderate response with regard to FCBU lending,

disbursements amounting to only US dollars 9 million during

the year. However, as the interest rates on rupee loans

continued to decline while the rupee continued to depreciate

gradually, the relative attractiveness of foreign currency loans

diminished. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) also

did not increase its short term borrowings in 1997.

Reflecting the recovery in the economy in general, and

the attractive stock prices, in particular, short-term capital

inflows by way of portfolio investment registered an

impressive overall growth of 82 per cent to US dollars 140

million. However, the regained foreign investor confidence

was reflected in a continuous net inflow of foreign capital

only throughout the period from February to July 1997 for

investments in the Colombo Stock Exchange. A continuous

net outflow was seen after August reflecting the impact of

138

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

the East Asian currency turmoil which caused falls in most

of the stock and currency markets in the region, and the

resulting expectation of a large depreciation of the domestic

currency. Although some of the early gains in net inflows

were off-set by these outflows, the year as a whole registered

a net inflow of US dollars 13 million in terms of portfolio

investment, following US dollars 7 million in 1996.

9.7 Exchange Rate Movements

Foreign Exchange markets, the East Asian region in

particular, faced severe uncertainty during the latter part of

1997, triggered by the currency crisis in the region. Countries

that were most affected by the turmoil were Indonesia,

Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the currencies

of which depreciated by 57 per cent, 50 per cent, 35 per

cent, 35 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, against the

US dollar during the year.

The currency turbulence in East Asia had little impact

on the Sri Lanka rupee mainly due to existing capital

controls, very small exposure to short-term external debt and

the continuous depreciation of the rupee under the flexibly

managed exchange rate system. The exchange market and

money market developments were closely monitored taking

into account the need to maintain stability in the market.

The Sri Lanka rupee depreciated by 7.5 per cent against the

US dollar, the intervention currency. This, together with the

significant appreciation of the US dollar against almost all

major currencies during the year, resulted in a depreciation

of the rupee against the SDR by 1.6 per cent.

Sri Lanka's Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)

index with twenty four trading partners (1995=100) indicated

an appreciation of 6 per cent from end December 1996 to

end December 1997. The Real Effective Exchange Rate

(REER) index based on the estimated inflation differentials

appreciated by 14 per cent in 1997. However, the erratic

behaviour of cross rates where the US dollar witnessed

significant appreciation against most major currencies,

particularly against the currencies of Sri Lanka's competitors

in East Asia, following the East Asian currency crisis and

the fact that the impact of currency depreciation on prices

has not yet been fully reflected in their inflation indicators

make the REER index a less reliable indicator of external

competitiveness. This is particularly so when there are large

changes in nominal exchange rates as seen in East Asia since

mid 1997. Considering the time lag in the adjustments of

cost of production and prices to exchange rate depreciation

in those countries, it would be more appropriate to assess

the changes in competitiveness in terms of a moving average

of effective exchange rate indices. Such an index would

smooth out some of the extreme volatility of day-to-day

cross-rate changes and would also capture this lagged effect.

The NEER calculated with trading partners on that basis

depreciated by 0.7 per cent. The REER appreciated by 6 per

cent. The managed float in Sri Lanka has the flexibility to

capture these effects while also allowing exchange market

conditions to be reflected in the exchange rate.

With the impact of other favourable developments in the real sector of the economy, the devalued Asian currencies had little short-run impact on Sri Lanka's external trade as seen by the high export growth and declining trade deficit. Highly import biased industries such as garments may even be in an advantageous position due to lower relative prices of imported raw materials from the Asian region. The competitive edge of the initial devaluation in Asian

currencies after the crisis is expected to be partly offset by high domestic inflation, rising interest rates and other supply side constraints which are already seen in those economies. Sri Lanka's flexibly managed exchange rate policy in line with underlying macro economic fundamentals, cautious approach to liberalisation of capital transactions and the limited exposure to short-term external debt have helped to cushion the economy against possible adverse effects of the East Asian currency crisis. An improved performance in the balance of payments and external assets position, a manageable level of external debt and a relatively attractive stock market showed that the Sri Lankan economy was able to withstand the adverse implications of potentially lower export competitiveness and large capital outflows, at least in the short run. Under the flexibly managed exchange rate system, the exchange rate could depreciate faster, if that is necessary, to restore any long lasting adverse effects of large

currency'depreciations in East Asia on Sri Lanka's external

competitiveness.

9.8 External Assets

Sri Lanka's gross external assets rose by 16 per cent

to a new record level of US dollars 2.822 million at the end

of 1997 turning around the declining trend recorded in the

previous few years. External assets of the Central Bank

grew by 5 per cent to US dollars 2,009 million and of the

commercial banks by 57 per cent to US dollars 793 million.

Gross official reserves, comprising foreign assets held by the

Central Bank and the Government, rose by 5 per cent to US

dollars 2,029 million during 1997. Gross external assets at

the end of 1997 were sufficient to finance 5.4 months of

imports projected for 1998, while gross official reserves were

sufficient to finance 3.9 months of projected imports.

another 22 per cent of the total debt outstanding, reflecting the impact of the appreciation of the US dollar against some of the major currencies. The external debt to GDP ratio, which declined from 72 per cent in 1995 to 62 per cent in

1996, declined further to 56 per cent improving the credit worthiness of the country. The net inflow of both long-term and short-term loan capital to the Government and the private sector was US dollars 240 million, most of which came in the form of long-term concessional assistance to the Government mainly from Japan, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Development Association (IDA).

The medium and long-term debt stock was US dollars

7,506 million, or 89 per cent of the total debt stock. Total

debt outstanding to the IMF declined in US dollar terms by

US dollars 97 million.

Government debt accounted for about 74 per cent of the total debt stock or 83 per cent of the medium and long-term debt of the country. Private sector debt without government guarantees represented about 2 per cent of total debt. Short-term debt outstanding at the end of the year reflected an increase of 4 per cent in US dollar terms mainly due to borrowings by BOI enterprises from FCBUs. Short tenn debt accounted for only 11 per cent of the total debt. They are largely suppliers' credits for raw materials supplied to the export processing industries and trade credits to the CPC.

9.9 External Debt

The developments in Sri Lanka's external debt in 1997

reflected the improvement in the balance of payments,

particularly a sharp decline in the current account deficit and

the changing composition of the capital account. Total

external debt at around US dollars 8,397 million at the end

of the year reflected a decline (about 3 per cent) for the

second consecutive year. Of the total debt stock, loans in

SDRs accounted for 38 per cent, while those in yen

represented 26 per cent. US dollar loans accounted for

declined from 15.7 per cent in 1996 to 13.7 per cent in

Debt service payments, which consist of amortisation of

foreign loans, declined by 2 per cent to US dollar 754

million in 1997. Amortisation payments declined by US

dollars 3 million and interest payments have declined by US

dollars 8 million. Repayments to the IMF, entirely reflecting

those on account of the Structural Adjustment Facility taken

between 1988 and 1990, amounted to US dollars 66 million.

Import and Export Controls

Sri Lanka's external trade policy continued to focus on achieving a liberalised trade regime by simplifying the tariff system while progressively reducing non-tariff barriers (NTBs). Quantitative restrictions on foreign trade are now limited to a well defined narrow list (a negative list) considered necessary mainly for reasons of national security, public health, environmental protection and domestic producer protection in a few selected areas.

maize remained under licence for reasons of domestic producer protection while paddy in husk remained under licence for phyto-sanitary reasons. Imports of wheat and meslin and wheat and meslin flour continued to remain under licence control in 1997 in order to fulfill the contractual obligations between the Government and Prima Ceylon Ltd., a milling company. During the year, ozone depleting substances such as carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and methyl bromide were brought under import licences for environmental reasons, namely, the protection of the Ozone layer. In summary, ab'out 300 items of a total of about 6000 items at 6 digit Harmonised System Code (HSC) level remained under import licence at end 1997.

Only four categories of exports, i.e. coral chunk and

shells, wood and article of wood (ebony), ivory and ivory

products and passenger motor vehicles first registered in Sri

Lanka prior to 1945, remained under licence with the

objectives of environmental protection and preservation of

antiques.

Tariffs and Taxes on External Trade

The thrust of the tariff policy in the past was oh the establishment of a simple and transparent tariff structure with lower rates and the improvement of Customs administration

to create an environment conducive to promoting economic development. In this context, Customs duty has been rationalised to a three band tariff system with 10, 20 and 35 per cent rates for imports effective since February 1995. Only a few import items, namely tobacco, liquor and some categories of motor vehicles, remain outside the three band system.

The export sector has continued to be free from all

export and ad-valorem sales taxes since end 1992, while

export cesses and royalties on some items continued to

remain in 1997.

Further consolidation of the tariff structure to a two band system with the primary focus on effective protection to local industries on a uniform basis remained a medium-term objective. The major emphasis on trade and tariff issues in the 1998 Budget was on improvements in the Customs administration, trade procedures and practices through the Customs modernisation programme. This programme envisages improvement of. the automated data entry processing Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA-H-) to a highly flexible and user friendly facility. This will also increase the effectiveness of Customs controls and the efficiency of the clearing process. The Customs administration will also expand into the field of

143

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

trade promotion by establishing an investor facilitation unit.

Improved surveillance, least inconvenience to exporters and

importers and prevention of illicit traffic are the objectives

of the proposed Cargo X -Ray system which is to be

implemented in the Port of Colombo to examine

containerised cargo using the most globally advanced system

of cargo examination.

In 1997, the Government appointed a Presidential

Commission of Inquiry of Trade and Tariff to study and

recommend further appropriate changes.to the tariff structure.

The Government has also appointed a Committee to examine

the implications of the proposed movement towards

preferential trade arrangements leading to free trade among

South Asian countries.

With a view to achieving high productivity, efficiency and expansion in economic activities by managing the trade and tariff policy in an effective manner, duty free facilities were made available by the 1998 Budget for several sectors to obtain raw material, plant and machinery. The textile and garment sector, which accounted for nearly 50 per cent of Sri Lanka's export earnings, spends more than 60 per cent of its earnings on importation of inputs. However, as more than 86 per cent of textile and garment imports hitherto were by the BOI enterprises on a duty free basis, the ratio of duty collection to total imports was as low as 0.8 per cent. The higher duty applicable to this sector was paid only, by non-BOI, mainly medium and small scale, industries. Therefore, in line with the present policy direction of rationlisation of the tariff structure to simplify and minimise anomalies, imports of yarn, fabrics and all related intermediate and capital goods were made duty free with effect from 6 November 1997. The complete removal of duty on this sector will reduce the work load of the Customs, simplify Customs procedures and eliminate Customs delays, corruption and smuggling.

To provide necessary assistance to agriculture, the imports of NPK fertiliser and agro-chemicals were exempted from Customs duty. Meanwhile imports of seed cleaning, sorting and grading machines, seed testing equipment and seed packing machines were also made duty free. The tea manufacturing sector will also benefit by the removal of duty on tea packing machinery and colour separators. The transport sector was given high priority. In addition to the duty concessions provided in the 1997 Budget, importation of agricultural tractors, lorries and refrigerated trucks were made duty free to assist in marketing and goods transport. Items imported for manufacturing tractors and lorries were made duty free towards further strengthening this objective while encouraging local industries to produce these items in a competitive environment. Large commercial organisations were provided with a duty free facility to import buses and coaches for providing transportation to their employees.

Furthermore, expenditure on account of these activities were

deductible from taxable income. Private sector bus operators

were allowed to import buses with a seating capacity over

40, free of duty. All these items were under the duty rate

of 10 per cent until 6 November 1997.

The fisheries industry was provided with duty free

imports of navigation equipment, spare parts for fishing

boats, fish finding devices and raw material for fishing nets.

These items were also at the 10 per cent rate earlier. Imports

of computers, software and related components,

telecommunication equipment and accessories were also

made duty free with a view to reducing the cost of modern

technology and communication facilities which are essentials

for rapid economic development. To reduce the cost of

medical services and to encourage private sector participation

in health services, capital goods including medical and dental

equipment and accessories, which were at 10 per cent duty

earlier, were exempted from Customs duty, In addition to the

duty free import of rough gemstones, tools, machinery and

equipment for cutting and processing of gems provided in

the 1996 Budget of November 1995, the gem and jewellery

industry was provided with duty free imports of gold,

gemstones and accessories used in manufacturing jewellery

for exports in the 1998.Budget. Furthermore, the gem and

jewellery industry was exempted from income- tax and the

national security levy. Import duty on rattans and bamboos

were made duty free to assist the local cane industry and

to safeguard the environment, while a programme to increase

the supply of local raw material is envisaged.

The mark up of 25 per cent imposed on the

computation of turnover tax on imports was also reduced to

10 per cent with effect from 6 November 1997. All items

which were made duty free were also exempted from

turnover tax.

In line with the present policy objectives, the granting of duty waivers on imports was limited to very essential items in the national interest. As a relief against the rising cost of living due to high food prices, full duty waivers on red split lentils (35 per cent), dried fish, dried sprats and dried prawns (10 per cent each) and partial waivers on full cream milk powder (10 per cent) and canned fish (5 per cent) continued throughout the year. A full duty waiver (20 per cent) was introduced on wheat with effect from 10 October 1997. A full duty waiver (35 per cent) on rice, which was introduced on 15 April 1996, was removed on 30 January 1997 following the successful Maha harvest. A partial duty waiver of 15 per cent, granted as a relief measure in the excess demand situation for onions, potatoes and dried chillies, which was effective from 4 December 1996, was withdrawn on 31 January 1997. A duty waiver of 17 per cent effective on sugar imports since 27 November

144

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

1996 was reduced to 10 per cent on 11 August 1997. A

duty waiver of 30 per cent granted on edible oils and copra

for a period of 7 months from 15 June 1996, to reduce the

domestic edible oil prices and also to assist the local

industries in the wake of high international prices of coconut

kernel products, was reduced to 20 per cent with effect from

16 January 1997. However, these ad hoc duty waivers create

uncertainty in the trade policy regime and hinder the

development of efficient markets. The minimum protection

that should be given to.the non-plantation agricultural sector

should be clearly defined and pre-announced for a given

period of about five years with further phasing out plans in

the long-run so that all producers, traders and consumers can

function in a more predictable policy environment. This

would lead to market efficiency which would improve

welfare gains to all.

With regard to intermediate goods, a limited number of duty waivers were granted as relief measures. Duty waivers were granted on yarn and poultry feed to help local producers of textiles and to poultry .farming. A-full'duty waiver was granted on shrimp food for the period 24 August

1996 to 24 February 1997 as a relief measure to shrimp cultivators. In the face of increased international prices of petroleum products, a full duty waiver (10 per cent) and partial duty waiver (10 per cent) were granted for LP gas and other petroleum products, respectively, from 15 January

1997 to 15 July 1997. To encourage the use of energy saving bulbs in order to conserve electricity, a full duty waiver (10 per cent) was granted on fluorescent lamps from 18 April 1997.

A full duty waiver on generators (10 per cent), which

was granted on 1 June 1996 with a view to encouraging the

use of generators by the private sector, was continued till

15 July 1997.

The effective import duty rate, the ratio of import duty collection to total adjusted imports, declined from 8.5 per cent in 1996 to 7.4 per cent in 1997, reflecting decreases in dutiable imports in relation to total imports, particularly in intermediate goods. The share of dutiable imports in total imports declined from 41 per cent in 1996 to 38.5 per cent in 1997 largely attributable to the increase in BOI imports, which amounted to 40 per cent of the total in 1997 in comparison to 35 per cent in 1996. In the intermediate good category, the effective duty rate dropped substantially, following the duty reductions granted on certain raw materials in the 1997 Budget and grant of duty waivers on LP gas and petroleum products from 15 January 1997 to 15 July 1997. Reflecting the impact of the duty waiver on petroleum products, effective duty rates for both crude oil and other petroleum categories dropped substantially. Although relatively high duty rates were applied (35 per

cent) on textiles and clothing, effective duty rates weie rather

small (0.8 per cent), as 86 per cent of the total amount were

imported duty free by BOI enterprises.

Effective duty rates on investment goods too declined in 1997, particularly on transport equipment. This was due to lower duty rates offered by the 1997 Budget for parts and accessories of transport equipment and passenger vehicles which showed substantial increases in import outlay during the year. A marginal reduction in the machinery and equipment category was partly due to a duty waiver on generators effective from June 1996 to July 1997.

In the consumer goods category the average effective

import duty rate rose significantly for food and drink imports

while that of non-food consumer goods declined marginally.

The increase in the effective import duty rate of the food

and drink category mainly reflects imports of rice and sugar.

The impact of removal of a full duty waiver of 35 per cent

on rice which was enjoyed for eight and a half months in

1996 and reduction of the duty waiver on sugar from 17 per

cent to 10 per cent on 11 August 1997 were reflected in

significantly higher duty rates in 1997. Only a very marginal

change can be seen in the effective rate of non-food

consumer goods.

Textile and Garment Quota Allocation

The performance based quota system continued in 1997 with priority given to new exporters and those who expanded their existing capacities, in allocating pool quotas. No major revisions in quota allocation took place in 1997. Quota availability to the USA, the EU and Canada rose by 5.6 per cent, 11.4 per cent and 0.9 per cent, respectively. As a result, overall quota availability increased by 6.2 per cent in comparison to the 13.5 per cent increase recorded in 1996. However, the overall quota utilisation rate declined to 65 per cent from 70 per cent in 1996 mainly due to weak demand for some quota categories. Meanwhile, a shift was also seen from low value added to high value added items. The utilisation of quotas varied widely across different categories and countries. To the USA market, quota availability and utilisation both increased significantly for certain items such as coats, trousers and play suits. To the same market, for other items such as night-wear, fabrics and suits for women, utilisation was higher than that in 1997 despite a lower quota allocation. Even though the quota availability was raised for items such as gloves, knitted blouses, shirts and shop towels, utilisation was much lower for those items. The quota utilsation rates for all items to the EU declined despite the rise in the available quota. With regard to the Canadian quota, only a few categories indicated satisfactory quota utilisation. The above performance was partly due to insufficient demand for some items which come under quota, indicating that an increase in quota availability also needed to be supported by demand for those items in those specific markets.

Incentives to Exporters

The Government introduced several policy measures during 1997, with a view to improving the competitiveness and profitability of the export sector. In order to reduce administrative delays and cumbersome procedures, implementation of existing schemes such as the Duty Rebate Scheme, the Inward Processing Scheme, Bonded Warehouse Scheme and Exemptions on Fiscal Levies Scheme through the Committee on Exemption of Fiscal Levies was abandoned in 1997. These schemes were thereafter

implemented directly by the Sri Lanka Customs and the

Ministry of Finance. As proposed in the 1997 Budget, the

scheme for exemption of fiscal levies on capital and

intermediate goods for export processing was amended.

Under this scheme, a 100 per cent exemption of duty and

taxes was granted on imports of capital and intermediate

goods by exporters who export over 50 per cent of their

production. A 50 per cent exemption was granted to those

who export between 25 per cent and 50 per cent. The

extension of the coverage of this scheme reduced the up­

front cost of investment, especially of small and medium

scale exporters (SMEs) in undertaking new investments,

upgrading existing machinery and increasing productivity.

With a view to reducing interest rates and making more

funds available to private sector investors, non-BOI

exporters were permitted to borrow in foreign currencies

from FCBUs as well as domestic banking units. In order

to stimulate investment, the depreciation allowance on plant,

machinery and equipment which was hitherto recovered at

33 1/3 per cent per annum was increased to 50 per cent

allowing investors to recover their investment expenditure

within two years. In addition, with a view to reducing the

up-front cost of investment, the national security levy on

imports of machinery and equipment which was reduced

from 4.5 per cent to 2 per cent in 1995, was further reduced

to 0.5 per cent in January 1997.

Exporters are able to take advantage of the fiscal incentives provided by the 1998 Budget to promote computer technology and train computer personnel, and the reduction of the minimum investment requirement for advanced technology from Rs.2.5 million to Rs.l million for existing companies and from Rs.10 million to Rs.4 million . for new companies. This helped SMEs to become eligible under this scheme and encouraged adoption of new technology. As an incentive to encourage further expansion of the garment industry, a three year extension of the existing tax holiday, proposed in the 1997 Budget, was granted to garment factories in difficult and most difficult areas, subject to creation of 150 extra jobs. A 100 per cent rebate was granted on the quoted freight rates for foliage, cut flowers, fruits and vegetables exports with effect from August 1997.

In the 1998 Budget, various incentives were proposed

to promote small and medium scale agricultural products,

fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, the gem and

jewellery industry and the textile and garment industry.

Existing and new companies engaged in the export of fresh

and processed fruits and vegetables which undertake the

cultivation of a minimum area of 5 hectares, were granted

a 10 year tax holiday together with duty free imports of

machinery and equipment. In addition to duty free imports

of gold, gem stones and accessories, the gem and jewellery

146

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

industry was exempted from income tax and the national

security levy. With the complete duty free status given to

the textile industry, the manufacture-in-bond scheme for

textiles was eliminated.

Institutional Support to Exporters

The Export Development Board (EDB) continued to

provide a wide range of services to further develop and

promote exports and to assist in improving the policy climate

for exports. With a view to developing and promoting mainly

non-traditional exports; the EDB advised exporters in various

aspects such as supply development, quality improvement,

productivity, export packaging and penetration of new

markets. Under technical and skills development

programmes, the EDB conducted several programmes and

workshops to assist exporters. Under market promotion,

several product specific fairs and general trade fairs were

conducted in addition to contact promotion programmes and

inward/outward buying missions for a wide range of products

including jewellery, garments, wooden handicrafts, handloom

products, footwear, coir products, spices,, ceramic giftware,

floriculture and aquarium fish. The EDB provided assistance

to develop export oriented SMEs in the provinces through

its provincial offices in Kandy, Kurunegala and Galle and

organised the participation of SMEs at the 'Jana Nipayum'

trade exhibition organised by People's Bank. Under the

Export Processing Village (EPV) programme, a delegation

from the European Fair Trade Association (EFTA), which

buys a major share of production, visited Sri Lanka to

explore the possibilities of diversifying the product range.

Expo'97 held in November 1997 helped to generate new orders worth US dollars 3 million. In addition, a single country exhibition was organised by the EDB in Belgrade in association with the Sri Lanka Tea Board, Ceylon Tourist Board, Bank of Ceylon and Air Lanka to promote business and trade relationships in Yugoslavia. The EDB, in collaboration with the International Trade Centre (ITC), organised a conference of all Trade Promotional Organisations (TPOs) in the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC), with the objective of enhancing regional trade linkages and opportunities for technical co-operation in trade among TPOs in the SAARC region.

During 1997, the Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation (SLECIC) continued to assist exporters by providing support services of export credit insurance and guarantees for the development and diversification of exports. During 1997, there were 214 policies in force for a value of Rs.l ^89 million in addition to 1,436 guarantees in force for a value of Rs.2,195 million. However, SLECIC's

business activities indicated a setback in 1997 following the

temporary closure of some export-oriented industries due to

losses carried forward from the end of the preceding year

following power cuts and labour unrest. Furthermore, the

cost of export credit insurance and guarantee services

remained high when turnover tax and the national security

levy were added to the premium. The existing small scale

insurance policy of the SLECIC was amended in February

1997, in order to make it more attractive to small scale

exporters and' perform competitively in the international

market.

Freight Rates

During 1997, shipping freight rates for several

destinations moved further downwards due to competition

among shipping lines following the continuation of the

liberalised shipping trade policy adopted in 1996. Shipping

lines covering nearly all destinations have adopted the

Freight of All Kind (FAK) system except to the USA and

East Canada, which have commodity based freight systems.

The average freight rates for all commodities shipped to the

UK, the North Continent, the Mediterranean, France, Egypt,

Syria, the Far East, Kuwait, Pakistan and Australia dropped.

The Ceylon Association of Ships' Agents (CASA) imposed a mandatory Terminal Handling Charge (THC) on exports in March 1997. Exporters strongly opposed this charge on the grounds that the THC would make Sri Lanka's exports less competitive. After several unsuccessful negotiations with the relevant authorities exporters made a complaint through the Ceylon Chamber Of Commerce to the Fair Trading Commission (FTC) against alleged anti­competitive practice by the CASA of imposing a THC on export shipments. The FTC is investigating the complaint and an order will be issued after the investigations are completed.

9.12 Trade Relations, Trading and Clearing Arrangements

Sri Lanka has gradually removed all non-tariff barriers, except for the import of wheat and wheat flour which are still under licensing requirements, and a few other goods which require licensing for non-economic reasons. Tariffs have been reduced to a three rates band, consisting of 10, 20 and 35 per cent. Thus, Sri Lanka has the most liberal trade and payments policy regime in the South Asian region.

To facilitate its commitments to the World Trade.

Organisation (WTO), sub-committees set up under the Inter-

Ministerial Co-ordinating Committee (IMCC) were

strengthened with participation from the private sector and

trade chambers. Sub-committees prepared draft legislation to

Sri Lanka Submits Offers to WTO on Financial Services

The General Agreement on Trade in Services tGATS) which covered 155 service sectois including financial services, was one of the Agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round. At the end of the Uruguay Round, the negotiations on financial services as with a few other service sectors did not achieve a satisfactory outcome. Hence, it was decided to continue the negotiations in this sector after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) was established on 1 January 1995 as an outcome of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff tGATT) negotiations with the objective of promoting globalisation of trade in goods and services. At the Singapore Ministerial Conference of the WTO held in December 1996. « was agreed that the nicmbcis would conclude the negotiations on the financial services sector by December 1997. Accordingly, a time frame was agreed upon and the first phase of negotiations commenced in Geneva m April 1997.

Sri Lanta's commitments under GATS v\ere, until recently, limited to just a tew hoiizontal commitments on 'commercial presence' (foreign investment) and 'presence of natural pci sons' (employment) and some specific commitments in tourism and travel related set vices. In February 1997. Sri Lanka submitted its commitments in the telecommunication sector.

Under the GATS, schedules of honzontal (applicable lo all sectors) commitments oi specific (applicable to a specific scclorl commitments are to be submitted by WTO member1; to be used as the basis for bilateral or multilateral negotiations towards the global liberalisation of sen ices. For each sector, such commitments, apply to 4 modes of supply (cross border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence and picscncc of natural persons) and 2 categories of limitation-, ion maiket access and on national treatment). While the tctm 'market access' is >elf explanatory, the national treatment obligation is to accord to the services and service suppliers of any other member, ticatmcnt no less favourable than is accorded to domestic sci vices and service suppliers A member wishing to maintain any limitation must indicate these limitations in the schedule of commitments.

In the schedules of commitments, domestic regulations which do not discriminate between the home country suppliers of the service and other service suppliers, either in terms of market access or national ticatmcnt, need not be included. In the case of financial services, such commitments are not expected to include measures faken

by authorities for puidenttal purposes. Further, the use of temporary non-discriminatory resuielions in payments and transfers in the event of serious balance of payments and external financial difficulties is permitted. In addition, the management of monetary and exchange rate policy falls outside the scope of the GATS.

In teims of Article II of the GATS, with Tespect to any measure covered by the Agreement, each member should immediately and unconditionally accoid to services and service supplieis of any other mcmbci, treatment no less favourable than it accords to like services and service suppliers of any other country. This ts known as Most Favoured Nafion (MFN) Treatment If any membra maintains a measure inconsistent with MFN Treatment, such a measure has to be listed as an exemption.

Once a specific commitment is liled by a eounuy under the GATS, it would be difficult to withdraw such a commitment, although specific L o m m t t m c n t s would not bar further hbeialisation.

During the Uruguay Round, the following activities were listed as financial services under two broad categories, namely, i.|) insuiance and related services and (2) banking and othci financial services (excluding insuiance) Life and non-life insurance services, re­insurance and rctioccssion. insurance intermediation such as broking and agency services and services' auxiliary to insurance were categonsed under the tormcr. Banking and other financial services (excluding insurance) included acceptance of deposits: lending of all types including consumer credit, mortgage ciedit. factoring and financing of commercial transactions, financial leasing: all payment and money transmission services: guarantees and commitments, trading in money market instruments; foreign exchange, derivatives, exchange rate and interest rate instruments such as swaps and forwaid rate, agreements, securities, other negotiable instruments, and othci assets such as gold: participation in issues of new securities, money bioking: asset management such as portfolio management or pension fund management, settlement and clearing services for financial assets: piovision and tianst'er of financial information and financial data pioi.cssing, advisor, and other uuxiliaiy financial services

Sri Lanka's policies in the aiea of financial services have been moic liberal than many countries. At present, Sri Lanka is not a major exportci of financial services.

but has great potential and expects to grow in the luturc. Thus, it was felt that the inclusion of a schedule o! specific commitments by Sri Lanka based on existing policies would enhance international iccognition ot the ltbcial policies m place in Sii Lanka's financial sector.

Accordingly. Sri Lanka submitted its draft conditional offers on insurance and banking and other linancial sciviees in December 1997 In the insurance sector, offers weie made m 3 sub scctois, i o (a) Life insurance, tbt Non-life insurance and (c) Rc-insurance and Retrocession.

Sri Lanka continued to negotiate concessions under the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA). The concessions received in 1996 were made effective from 15 July 1997 by a Gazette notification. The third round of trade negotiations began in July 1997 in Kathmandu. Sri Lanka's objective was to expand the list of products covered under SAPTA and to deepen the tariff concessions already received. Sri Lanka submitted its request list at the first meeting. The negotiations under the third round are expected to be concluded by April 1998. Meanwhile, at the SAARC summit held in Male in May 1997, Heads of SAARC member countries agreed to advance the South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) by the year 2001. However, this seems too ambitious when the very modest results obtained at SAPTA negotiations over the last two years are considered. The major contributory factor to slow progress in SAPTA

negotiations is the reluctance to abolish non-tariff barriers by

other member countries.

Sri Lanka also completed its commitments under Phase II of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement phasing out procedures by submitting a list of items to the Textile Monitoring Body of the WTO. With this list, Sri Lanka has completed 17 per cent of the phasing-out requirement, due to be completed by December 2004.

The Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP)

among the Group of 77 made further efforts to expand the

GSTP membership, product coverage and the depth of tariff

reductions. However, the results of negotiations remained

insignificant in 1997.

The Bangkok Agreement which was signed in 1975 is expected to be one of the important regional trade agreements in Asia once China accedes to it. China has Concluded bilateral meetings to exchange tariff concessions with a majority of the members including Sri Lanka. During

149

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

the negotiations China agreed to offer concessional tariffs for

over 40 products covering almost all the items currently

exported by Sri Lanka to China.

The. International Natural Rubber Agreement III that

came into force in December 1995 remained in force during

1997. However, there have been no significant developments

under this Agreement during 1997. Sri Lanka maintained its

position of not acceding to the International Coffee

Agreement in 1997 as well.

On a bilateral level, Sri Lanka had discussions with four joint commissions for economic and technical co-operation from India, Kuwait, Iran and the European Union in 1997. Lowering tariffs and removing non-tariff barriers for products of export interest to Sri Lanka were discussed at bilateral meetings with India. India offered to extend concessions on a unilateral basis for at least 70 products. Sri Lanka prioritised 84 products from the list of 182 products originally submitted to India for trade concessions. A response to this has not yet been received.

At the first session of the Sri Lanka-Kuwait joint commission, possibilities for joint marketing arrangements between Sri Lanka and Kuwait companies to promote Sri Lankan products in the countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) were explored. The two countries agreed to encourage companies in both countries to establish joint ventures with the aim of undertaking business ventures in the two countries, the rest of the GCC and SAARC. Sri Lanka also sought the assistance of the Government of Kuwait to encourage the Kuwait Investment Authority to invest in public quoted companies and infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka.

The Sri Lanka-Iran joint commission held its fifth session in Colombo in 1997. At the session the possibilities of establishing joint ventures for the manufacture of melamineware, chandeliers and machine made carpets were discussed.

The 13th Session of the Sri Lanka-European Union joint

commission was also held in Colombo in 1997. The session

focused on the development of economic, trade and

commercial co-operation.

The joint commissions with Egypt, China and Cyprus

did not meet in 1997. The next set of meetings of those

commissions is scheduled to take place in 1998;

9.13 Internal Trade and Institutional Arrangements

The internal trade policy of the country is to allow the market mechanism to determine prices and quantities and to

intervene in the market only to avoid harmful price and

quantity fluctuations of selected important goods. The

Ministry of Internal and International Commerce and Food,

the Ministry of Agriculture, the Treasury and affiliated

departments had given due consideration to avoid excessively

low prices that could affect local producers and to avoid too

high prices that may affect consumers. Bonded warehousing

systems, guaranteed price schemes, tariffs and the use of

public sector agencies such as the Co-operative Wholesale

Establishment (CWE), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC)

and State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) were employed

in the procurement, import and distribution of these items.

The Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE)

continued local purchases of important agricultural products

as a relief measure to local producers and to supply their

retail outlets. Big onion purchases increased from 1,088

metric tons in 1996 to 1,570 metric tons in 1997 recording

a 44 per cent increase. The local purchases of dried chillies

decreased marginally from 1,849 metric tons in 1996 to

1,797 metric tons in 1997. Local purchases of sugar showed

a drastic decline from 4,608 metric tons in 1996 to 290

metric tons in 1997 due to lower domestic production.

The Government uses the CWE to control imports of

important food items, when such items are under import

licence. The removal of licensing on dried chillies, big

onions and potatoes in July 1996 resulted in the CWE

importing no dried chillies at all, because of heavy private

. sector imports. However, 5,863 metric tons of big onions

were imported by the CWE, to supply their retail outlets.

Reflecting a movement in the right direction, a market take­

over of imports as a result of removing the licensing

requirement is seen in the declining share of imports by the

CWE. The share of rice imports by the CWE fell from 11

per cent in 1996 to 8 per cent in 1997. The share of big

onions dropped from 7 per cent in 1996 to 5 per cent in

1997, while dried chillies dropped from 5 per cent to no

imports at all in 1997.

Wheat flour production is still monopolised by Prima

Ceylon Ltd. The wheat grain is imported by the CWE and

processed by the Prima mill. However, when milling is not

sufficient or if there is a scarcity, the CWE imports wheat

flour. The distribution of wheat flour was liberalised and the

entire consumer subsidy was removed by August 1997. The

price per kilogram of wheat flour rose to Rs.18.15 on 10

August 1997 from Rs.16.15 per kilogram that had prevailed

since December 1996.

The number of retail shops operated by the CWE increased to 147 in 1997 from 145 in 1996. The total number of wholesale shops remained at 35. The combined turnover of wholesale and retail shops increased from

150

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Rs.4,680 million in 1996 to Rs.5,392 million in 1997.

However, the franchise shops reported a low turnover in

1997. Sales dropped from Rs.698 million in 1996 to Rs.432

million in 1997. The CWE has appointed 14 field officers

to look into the causes of the reduction in sales. The number

of operating franchise shops was 3,500 in 1997.

The other wing of the Government's food distribution

network, the Co-operative Movement, has also shown a

development since 1996. The total number of primary co­

operative societies grew from 12,283 in 1996 to 12,410 in

1997. The membership of the societies grew from 5 million

members in 1996 to 5.1 million members in 1997.

Maintenance of the free market system necessitates

probing into unfair trading practices, violations of product

quality standards and consumer welfare measures stipulated

by the Government. This function is carried out by the

Department of Internal Trade (DIT) and the Fair Trading

Commission (FTC), affiliated to the Ministry of Internal and

International Commerce and Food.

The DIT, formerly the Price Control Department,

maintained price controls on imported pharmaceuticals, on

which price orders are drawn by the FTC, and entered into

an agreement on the maximum prices of beef and mutton

with traders of beef and mutton in 18 districts with effect

from 26 September iV37. Penal sections of the Price Control

Act were enforced on imported drugs, and pharmaceuticals

during 1997. A total of 151 inspections were carried out, in

the course of which 73 offences were detected.

The DIT also conducted 2,262 raids on-business enterprises fo inspect their adherence to the conditions laid down by the Consumer Protection Act. The DIT assisted the Agricultural Development Ministry to investigate fertiliser adulteration and non-conformity to the standards set forth with formula categorisation, and violation of regulations in the context of selling, distribution and storage. The successful number of raids was 1,965 out of which 1,404 offenders were prosecuted in 1997.

The DIT conducted several programmes to enhance consumer protection and awareness, and improve the quality of the market place. The DIT intervened to resolve disputes due to sale of substandard goods, and non-availability of after-sales services. Several programmes have been launched to create awareness among consumers on consumer rights. The DIT also issued two directions to enhance consumer protection. Direction 100 requires all cigarette packs to contain one of the two health warnings given by the Government in all three languages. Direction 101 requires all milk powder packs to contain the date of manufacture, date of packing and the date of expiration in a conspicuously legible manner.

The DIT is also a member of Consumers International

(CI), an organisation closely collaborating with the UN

Economic and Social Council (UNECOSOC). Sri Lanka,

represented by the DIT, has been in the steering committee

of the Asia and Pacific Region of the CI.

The Fair Trading Commission (FTC) determined the

prices of pharmaceuticals, investigated seven anti-competitive

practices and was also involved in food security matters and

consumer awareness activities. The FTC investigated anti­

competitive practices against firms engaged in the poultry

industry, supply and distribution of liquor, importation of

glass bottles, importation of lubricants, production of plastic

water bottles, cargo handling at the port and ground handling

at the Bandaranaike International Airport. A draft Bill was

introduced in 1997 to amalgamate the activities of the DIT

and FTC, in order that one unified institution would be able

to carry out probing activities more effectively in the future.

9.14 Tourism

The tourism sector, recovered further during 1997

reflecting the resilience in the industry. Tourist arrivals in

1997 grew by 21 per cent to 366,165. The gross earnings

from the tourist industry rose at an even higher rate of 26

per cent reflecting an increase in the average income earned

per tourist. The bomb attack which occurred in Colombo at

the start of the peak season in November affected the

industry somewhat in 1997.

Following the recovery in arrivals, foreign guest nights grew by 31 per cent, while the overall occupancy rate rose to 49 per cent, compared with 40 per cent in 1996. On a region wise basis, all regions recorded growth, with more pronounced increases in the South coast followed by the hill country. The improvement in the ancient cities was mainly attributed to a rise in the occupancy rates of the hotels at Habarana, Sigiriya and Dambulla. The increase in local guest nights by more than 20 per cent brought further relief to the industry which has suffered due to the country's security situation over the past few years.

The number of hotel units in the graded accommodation

sector increased from 144 to 158, mainly in the South coast

and in the ancient cities. With the increased number of hotel

units, room capacity grew from 11,600 to 12,370.

Employment in the sector also showed an improvement.

Direct employment grew from 31,963 to 34,200 persons,

while indirect employment increased from 44, 748 to 47, 880

persons.

Tourist arrivals from all major regions showed increases

over 1996. Western Europe, which continued to be the

leading source of tourist traffic to the country, accounting

151

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

for 58 per cent of the total arrivals, recorded a 27 per cent increase. Higher arrivals were recorded from all countries in Western Europe. The UK, which became the main single source of arrivals outnumbering Germany in 1996, continued to maintain its position in 1997. The substantial appreciation of the sterling pound against the Sri Lankan rupee which lowered the cost of vacationing in Sri Lanka for UK nationals may have led to this turnaround. Arrivals from Asia, the second largest source grew by 10 per cent. A growth in arrivals from most countries in the Asian region except Indonesia. Thailand and Pakistan, was seen. The lower arrivals from Indonesia and Thailand may be partly a reflection of the financial crisis in these countries. Arrivals from Australasia, North America and Eastern Europe too increased by 34 per cent, 28 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, increasing the diversification of tourist arrivals.

As in the past, vacation was the main purpose of arrivals in 1997, accounting for about 95 per cent of total arrivals. The remainder were for purposes such as business and visiting friends and relatives. Reflecting the potential for the promotion of novel aspects of pleasure tourism such as eco-tourism and culture tourism, the revenue from foreign visitors who visited wild life parks, botanical gardens, zoological gardens and the cultural triangle continued to increase in 1997. The number of tourists who visited the zoological gardens grew by 35 per cent and earnings increased by 53 per cent in US dollar terms. Revenue received from visits to botanical gardens and wild life parks rose by 22 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively. The number of tourists visiting the cultural triangle grew by 40 per cent while the income from sale of tickets showed a 43 per cent increase, also due to an upward revision in prices of tickets by US dollars 2.50 to US dollars 32.50. The Sri Lanka Convention Bureau continued to promote meetings, incentive travel, conventions and exhibitions (MICE ) tourism in 1997. The number of tourists who visited under the MICE category grew by more than four fold over 1996 as the number of conferences and exhibitions held in 1997 had doubled.

Arrivals Tourist Nights

1995

Year

Of the total arrivals, 69 per cent travelled by scheduled

inter-regional flights, while another 25 per cent arrived by

intra-regional flights. Air Lanka flights brought in 46 per

cent of the total number of tourists in 1997 compared with

48 per cent in 1996. Charter flights brought in 6 per cent

of the total and recorded an increase of 48 per cent over

1996. As charters play a vital role in developing leisure

destinations, the industry will benefit immensely by increased

charter operations.

In the 1998 Budget, the Government granted a series

of concessions to the tourism industry in order to' promote

Sri Lanka as a tourist destination and to exploit its full

potential for national economic development. Turnover tax

(1 per cent) on hotel accommodation charges has been

removed. Imports of goods for refurbishment and upgrading

of hotels and import of vehicles for transport of tourists were

exempted from import duty for a period of one year with a

view to improving the quality of facilities in tourist hotels

and expanding transport facilities in the tourist sector.

Moreover, corporate income tax on the tourist industry has

been reduced from 35 per cent to 15 per cent to ensure a

reasonable after tax rate of return for the investor in the

tourist hotel industry.
