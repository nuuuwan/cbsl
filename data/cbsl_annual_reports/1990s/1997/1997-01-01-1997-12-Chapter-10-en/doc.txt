10. FINANCIAL SECTOR

10.1 Monetary Policy

Monetary management in 1997 faced the challenge of

supporting the economic recovery, without disturbing the

declining trend in inflation in the early part of the year, and

maintaining a proper balance between the money market and

foreign exchange market. In the context of the East Asian

currency turmoil, the domestic financial system had to be

guarded against speculative attacks through close monitoring

of market developments and appropriate policy responses.

Accordingly, the highlights of monetary policy in 1997 were

some relaxation of its tightness at the beginning of the year

to support an orderly reduction in interest rates and a slight

tightening towards the end of the year, to preserve stability

in the domestic financial market amidst some uncertainty in

the market following the East Asian currency crisis.

Towards the end of 1996, the economy was gradually

recovering from the ill effects of the severe drought.

Economic activity was picking up. The high levels of

monetary expansion seen in the early part of the year had

been controlled. Inflationary pressures were abating, as

economic activities recovered. Government borrowing from

the banking system was reduced as fiscal management

improved and the deficit was narrowed. However, credit

growth to the private sector was slow and some liquidity

constraints were being observed in the market.

The monetary policy was relaxed somewhat in the

first few months of 1997 after some years of continued

tightness. The statutory reserve requirement (SRR) was

reduced twice, the first reduction after 1992. On 17 January,

the SRR on rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks

was reduced from 15 per cent to 14 per cent. The SRR on

foreign currency deposits placed abroad, which stood at 5

per cent, was abolished. However, the SRR on foreign

currency deposits lent domestically was maintained at 15 per

cent. On 28 March, a second reduction was effected. The

SRR on rupee deposits was reduced from 14 per cent to 12

per cent, while the SRR on foreign currency deposits lent

domestically was reduced from 15 per cent to 12 per cent.

The SRR on foreign currency deposits placed abroad was

maintained at the zero level.

A further measure of relaxation of monetary policy was

instituted in January, when, following the announcement

made in the Budget 1997, commercial banks were permitted

to provide foreign currency loans to direct and indirect non-

BOI exporters either from their domestic units or from their

Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs). This measure also

represented a further liberalisation of the capital account of

the Balance of Payments. However, in providing this facility,

due precaution was taken by placing specific limits and

restrictions to contain the foreign currency exposure of the

economy. Foreign borrowings by commercial banks were

limited to 15 per cent of their capital. The conversion of

domestic currency to repay these loans was not permitted,

requiring borrowers to repay only in foreign currency.

Several reasons underlay these measures. In the first

instance, the reductions in the SRR were designed to provide

an immediate injection of liquidity into the system by

releasing around Rs.8,000 million of reserve money held by

the Central Bank, to the commercial banks. The consequent

increase in the money multiplier would then create the

potential for commercial banks to increase their credit levels

ultimately by about Rs.20,000-Rs.25,000 million which

would help boost credit to the private sector and support the

recovery of the economy. Moreover, the reduction in the

SRR would reduce the effective cost of funds of commercial

banks, thus enabling them to reduce their lending rates. This

measure also represented a further step in the Central Bank's

move away from the use of direct controls to the use of

more market oriented instruments in the implementation of

monetary policy. The provision of foreign currency loans to

non-BOI exporters was designed to increase liquidity in the

market and to enable them to obtain credit at relatively low

rates to improve their international competitiveness.

Following the reductions in the SRR, as expected,

liquidity in the commercial banks increased significantly.

This was initially invested in Treasury bills through

purchases from the secondary window of the Central Bank.

Gradually, however, the funds moved back into the credit

operations of the commercial banks. Commercial banks also

reduced their lending rates on many of their loan schemes,

reflecting the impact of the reduction in the SRR on their

cost of funds. However, as has been observed by many

economists, while increases in SRR are effective in reducing

credit if there is no excess liquidity, reductions in SRR do

not necessarily lead to corresponding increases in credit

unless there is additional demand for credit. Thus, due to

caution on the part of both borrowers and lenders, the

realised credit expansion consequent on the reduction in SRR

was slower than expected. Together with additional liquidity

arising from the inflow of foreign funds into the system, this

led to a situation where commercial banks began increasing

their portfolio of government securities and reducing the rates

offered on deposits, resulting in lower interest rates at

Treasury bill auctions. Overall, the reduction in deposit, rates

153

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

exceeded the reduction in lending rates, as evidenced by a

fall in the average weighted deposit rate from 12.3 per cent

in December 1996, to 10.0 per cent in December 1997, in

comparison to a fall in the average weighted lending rate

from 21.0 per cent to 20.1 per cent in the same period.

However, the average prime lending rate declined faster from

18.4 per cent to 14.2 per cent during the same period.

A considerable inflow of foreign assets was experienced

through the receipts from the Government's privatisation

efforts, mobilisation of foreign funds by the development

finance institutions and international compensation to victims

of the war in Kuwait. These inflows added to the liquidity

in the system and led to a further reduction in interest rates.

Monetary policy during the second and third quarters of

1997 was therefore directed towards ensuring an orderly

reduction in interest rates. Towards this end, open market

operations (OMO) were engaged in to mop up excess

liquidity. When the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills

was exhausted, the Bank issued its own securities for OMO:

This is the first occasion since 1994 when the Bank has

issued its own securities. Short-term Central Bank securities,

with maturities of 7 days and 28 days were issued to

stabilise the lower end of short-term rates. The total gross

value issued amounted to Rs.7,835 million. Implementation

of monetary policy was assisted by improved fiscal

management. The potential for monetary expansion due to

the inflow of privatisation proceeds was dampened to a large

extent by an immediate retirement of Rs.10,000 million

worth of Treasury, bills held by the Central Bank and the

build up of government deposits with the Central Bank.

Towards the end of the year, with inflation being a little higher than expected, and some uncertainty being experienced in the foreign exchange market due to the East Asian Currency crisis, policies were implemented to increase short-term interest rates slightly. The repurchase rate, which had been gradually reduced to 7 per cent by April, and stood at 9 per cent during most of the fourth quarter in line with market trends, was increased to 11 per cent by end December. This was .both to ensure a positive real rate of return in the short-end of the market as a slight increase in inflation was' seen in November and December, and to discourage the use of relatively cheap call market funds for the speculative purchase of foreign exchange. The margin between the Central Bank's discount and rediscount rate for Treasury bills was also increased to influence the cost of liquidity provided by the Bank.

The policy of not granting refinance under the Medium

and Long-Term Credit Fund (MLCF) or short-term refinance

schemes, except to distressed finance companies, was

maintained. However, the outstanding level of past refinance

granted declined from Rs.2,259 million at end 1996 to

Rs.l,691 million by end December 1997, due to larger

repayments.

10.2 Money Supply

Despite a sharp increase in the net foreign assets of the

banking .system, the deceleration in monetary expansion

experienced in the second half of 1996 continued into 1997,

due to a repayment of government credit to the banking

sector utilising privatisation proceeds, and a slower than

expected pick up in bank credit to the private sector. The

rate of monetary growth remained low throughout 1997,

despite some relaxation of the monetary policy stance in the

early part of the year. Although, in contrast to the

developments in the previous two years, a large increase in

the net foreign assets of the banking system was experienced

in 1997, slower growth, in domestic credit helped contain

monetary expansion. In fact, net credit to government

contracted in 1997. The growth of Board Money (M2) stood

at 13.8 per cent on a point to point basis at end December

1997 (10.8 per cent at end December 1996), having fallen

to a low of 8.0 per cent at end April. With the sharp decline

in interest rates and inflation in 1997. the opportunity cost

of holding cash or demand deposits declined and Narrow

Money (Ml) grew at a faster pace than in the past two

years. At end December 1997, the point to point increase

in Ml was 9.8 per cent, in comparison to 4.0 per cent at

end December 1996.

increase in money supply in 1997 was this increase in NFA.

NFA of the banking system grew by Rs.27,425 million (44

per cent) in 1997, accounting for 78 per cent of the increase

in M2, in contrast to a contraction of Rs.4.671 million (7

per cent) in 1996. Declining domestic interest rates and the

East Asian currency crisis encouraged commercial banks to

improve their net foreign assets position. NFA of the

commercial banks increased by Rs.l 1,281 million, while their

gross foreign assets increased by Rs.20.047 million.

Net domestic assets of the banking system increased by

only 4 per cent in 1997 in comparison to a much higher

increase of 18 per cent in 1996, and accounted for only 22

per cent of the increase in M2. A contraction in credit to

the Government from the banking system and slower growth

in private sector credit were primarily responsible for this

dampened growth. A reduced deficit following improved

fiscal management and assisted by receipts exceeding

Rs.22,000 million from the privatisation programme enabled

the Government to reduce its liabilities to the banking sector

by Rs.2,172 million. This was the net result of a reduction

of Rs.l3.991 million of credit from the Central Bank and

an increase in credit of Rs.l 1,819 million from commercial

banks. This implies a significant reduction in the

expansionary impact of government borrowing as credit from

the Central Bank expands the stock of high powered money

(reserve money), creating the potential for even greater

expansion in money supply and consequent inflation.

Furthermore, the increase in credit from commercial banks

represented a discretionary change in the asset portfolio of

commercial banks, rather than new credit obtained by the

Government. Commercial banks exercised greater caution in

their lending operations in 1997 and demonstrated a

preference for investment in government securities, which are

assets without default risk. Commercial bank holdings of

government securities increased by Rs.6,736 million, in

comparison to an increase of Rs.3,978 million in 1996,

despite the lower yield on these instruments in 1997 than

in 1996.

Private sector credit grew at a slow pace of 11.4 per

cent or Rs.22,188 million in 1997, as against 7.8 per cent

or Rs.25,736 million in 1996. Both supply and demand

factors contributed to this moderate growth. Commercial

banks displayed greater caution in extending credit from their

domestic units. Demand too was constrained, with some

borrowers adopting a wait and see approach towards large

scale investments, while others resorted to credit from

FCBUs or development finance institutions. Some corporate

borrowers also obtained funds directly from investors through

rights issues and the issue of commercial paper due to a

downward rigidity in commercial bank lending rates,

reducing the demand for bank credit. However, a somewhat

different picture emerges when one considers total lending,

inclusive of credit from FCBUs. as discussed below.

Credit expansion picked up in the last two months of

the year. Of the total increase in credit to the private sector

from the domestic units of commercial banks. 40 per cent

(Rs.8,894 million) was granted in November and December.

Credit to government corporations increased by 4 per cent

in 1997, in comparison to an increase of 17 per cent in

1996. due to high credit utilisation by the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation and the C.W.E.

In view of the increasing impact of FCBU transactions on the domestic economy, a consolidated monetary survey including both the domestic units and the FCBUs of commercial banks was compiled for the first time in 1996. This was continued in 1997. The consolidated monetary survey indicated a 13.2 per cent point to point growth in broad money at end 1997, in comparison to a growth of 11.3 per cent at end 1996. An analysis of the causal factors of this growth indicted that 58 per cent of the growth was due to the growth in NFA and 42 per cent due to growth in net domestic assets, whereas in 1996, the change in NFA contributed to a 5 per cent decline in money supply. As in the case of the conventional monetary survey including the domestic units alone, net credit to the government from the banking system showed a contraction (of Rs.l,881 million). However, in contrast to the results in the domestic unit monetary survey, credit to the private sector has grown by 14.3 per cent in 1997. in comparison to 8.9 per cent in 1996. Total credit extended to the private sector amounted to Rs.32,878 million in 1997, as against Rs.30,789 million in 1996, indicating an increase in the credit from FCBUs. This credit from FCBUs is obtained mainly by BOI firms. With approximately 16 per cent of

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

GDP coming from the manufacturing sector and 82 per cent

of industrial exports being accounted for by BOI firms, it

is clear that FCBUs have provided a significant amount of

credit for the economic activity in the country. The

consolidated monetary survey also indicates that the slower

growth in credit from the domestic units of commercial

banks is offset by the additional credit provided by the

FCBUs.

Reserve Money

Reserve money (high powered money or base money)

decreased by Rs.l,773 million (2.1 per cent) in 1997 to

Rs.83,736 million at the end of December, in contrast to an

increase of Rs.6.922 million (8.8 per cent) in 1996. However,

this decrease must be viewed in the context of the decreases

in the statutory reserve requirement (SRR). which released

around Rs.8.000 million of reserve money (RM) held with

the Central Bank to the commercial banks for their usual

operations. On the sources side, the decrease in reserve

money was primarily due to a decrease in net credit to

government of Rs.13.991 million, which was mainly a

consequence of the retirement of Rs.l0.000 million worth of

Treasury bills held by the Central Bank and the build up of

deposits with the Central Bank through the use of the

proceeds from privatisation. This was offset by a significant

increase in the net foreign asset holdings of the monetary

authorities. From the perspective of uses, commercial bank

deposits held with the Central Bank decreased by Rs.5.370

million as the effect of the reduction in SRR overrode the

effect of the additional reserves required on increased

deposits with commercial banks. Currency in circulation

increased by Rs.3,655 million. Reflecting the impact of the

reduction in the SRR. the money multiplier (M2/RM)

increased and remained in the range of 3.12-3.63 in 1997.

compared with 2.88-3.01 in 1996. The income velocity of

money increased slightly to 3.3 in 1997, from 3.2 in 1996.

103 Interest Rates

The year 1997 was characterised by a fall in interest

rates, mainly due to increased liquidity in the market,

declining inflationary expectations, improved fiscal

performance and a relatively low interest rate volatility due

to active open market operations by the Central Bank. The

introduction of market oriented medium-term Treasury bonds

by the Government provided a medium-term risk free yield

curve to the public. After a sharp decline in interest rates

in the early part of the year, rates stauiiised and interest rate

volatility was very low.

Short-term Interest Rates

The main short-term interest rates are the overnight

Repo rate, the secondary market Treasury bill rates, inter­

bank call rates, the 3, 6, 12 months Treasury bill rates, and

the deposit and lending rates for periods under one year.

During 1997. almost all short-term rates declined sharply due

to improved Treasury cash management, assisted by inflows

from privatisation, a favourable balance of payments position,

the reduction in SRR by the Central Bank and the

permission granted to non-BOI exporters to obtain foreign

currency loans. Many of these factors worked to reduce the

yield on Treasury bills of all maturities. This led to a general

downward movement in the interest rate structure of the

country, demonstrating the importance of Treasury bill yields

as a leading indicator in determining other interest rates in

the market. The rates applicable to Central Bank Treasury

bill transactions (i.e., repo and secondary markets) also

moved in line with market rates.

Primary Market Treasury Bill Rates

• At the beginning of 1997, the 3-month Treasury bill rate

was 17.14 per cent. It declined to 12.86 per cent at end

January 1997. This rate gradually declined further thereafter

as inflation fell rapidly and liquidity was released to the

market through the reduction in the SRR and further

improved due to foreign inflows. The 3-month yield fell to

a low of 9.91 per cent at end October, following the

retirement of Rs.10,000 million of Treasury bills held by the

Central Bank in August and the inflow of proceeds from

privatisation, before rising marginally to 9.97 at end

December 1997. In line with the same trends, the 6-month

and 12-month Treasury bill rates also declined from 17.03

per cent to 10.09 per cent and 17.11 per cent to 10.21 per

cent, respectively, during the year 1997. Almost all the

auctions were over-subscribed, despite the fall in yields,

indicating the improvement in market liquidity.

Secondary Market and Repo Market Rates

The secondary market in Treasury bills plays an

important role in the open market operations of the Central

Bank. The yield rates offered by the Central Bank for its

repo, discount and rediscount operations also directly affect

the short-term interest rate structure in the money market.

In line with the primary market rate trend, repo, discount and

rediscount rates were reduced. During January 1997, the 3-

month discount rate of the Central Bank varied between

12.61-16.89 per cent, while the 3-month rediscount rate

varied between 14.36-18.64 per cent. However, after

February, the 3-month discount rate declined gradually from

12.53 per cent to 9.62 per cent in October, before rising to

9.97 per cent at end December 1997. The 3-month rediscount

rate varied in the range 18.64 - 14.36 per cent in January

and then declined gradually from 13.99 per cent in the first

week of February to 10.95 per cent in the first week of

September and thereafter increased to 12.97 per cent at end

December 1997. The stability in the discount and rediscount

rates assisted in stabilising rates in the inter-bank call money

market. The margin between the discount rate and the

rediscount rate was maintained at 1.75 percentage points

during the first five months of 1997.

The Central Bank was a net seller in the secondary market (the volume of bills discounted exceeded the volume of bills rediscounted) during this period, indicating that the economy was experiencing additional liquidity. From the last week of May 1997 to end August the margin between the discount rate and the rediscount rate was reduced to 1.25 percentage points to ease a temporary liquidity shortage in the market, evidenced by a rise in the call market rates towards the end of May. In June 1997, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was a net purchaser of Treasury bills in the

secondary market, thus injecting liquidity into the market.

With the subsequent improvement in market liquidity, the

Central Bank again became a net seller in the secondary.

. market towards the end of the third quarter and the margin

between the discount rate and the rediscount rate was raised

to the earlier level of 1.75 percentage points.in September.

The financial crisis in East Asia and the sharp

depreciation of certain currencies in the region appeared to

cause some concern that a similar depreciation would be

experienced by the Sri Lankan rupee. This led exporters to

delay repatriating their export proceeds and importers to

obtain forward cover for the payment of their import bills.

The fall in domestic interest rates also reduced the

opportunity cost of using rupee funds. Commercial banks,

who thus faced a shortage of foreign exchange for

transactions, purchased exchange from the Central Bank.

Banks obtained rupee funds for these purchases partly by

selling Treasury bills to the Central Bank. Therefore, to

discourage speculative activity, and because a slight increase

in inflation was experienced towards the end of the year, the

Central Bank raised' its repo rate and the rediscount rate. The

margin of 1.75 percentage points between the discount rate

and the rediscount rate was increased to 2.25 per cent at end

November and again by 1.00 percentage point during

December to reach 3.25 per cent at end 1997, raising the

overnight rediscount rate to 12.85 per cent.

The Central Bank's overnight repo rate, which was

12.75 per cent at the beginning of the year, was reduced to

11.00 per cent by the end of February 1997 and to 7.00 per

cent in April in line with market trends and in view of the

liquidity in the market. Thereafter, until the end of

November, the repo rate was maintained in a narrow range

of 8.00-9.00 per cent. In December, for the reasons indicated

above, it was gradually increased to reach 11.00 per cent at

the end of the year.

Deposit Rates

Deposit rates of commercial banks play a vital role in determining their cost of funds as well as the return to the deposit holders of the bank. In line with the reduction in Treasury bill rates, and because of the availability of liquid funds in the market, commercial bank deposit rates declined by 4.00-7.00 percentage points for many deposits during the year. Savings deposit rates of commercial banks, which were in the range of 4.50-13.00 per cent in 1996, declined to 3.00 to 11.00 per cent by end 1997. Fixed deposit rates of commercial banks declined from 9.00-17.75 per cent to 8.50 to 15.25 per cent in 1997. The Average Weighted Deposit 'Rate (AWDR), which is estimated by using all savings, time and other deposit rates of commercial banks, declined from 12.3 per cent at end December 1996 to 10.00

159

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

per cent at end December 1997. The Average Weighted

Fixed Deposit Rate (AWFDR) declined from 14.3 to 11.5

per cent during this period.

The National Savings Bank (NSB), showing greater

flexibility in its interest rates than in the past, revised its

deposit rates on 12-month fixed deposits downward from

15.00 per cent at end February 1997 to 14.00 per cent in

March and to 13.20 per cent in May, following market

trends. In August 1997, this rate was further decreased to

12,00 per cent, and in November to 11.00 per cent.

Furthermore, in line with the declining trend in short-term

rates, the interest on savings deposits was also decreased to

10.80 per cent in May 1997, from 12 per cent.

Lending Rates

Lending rates of banks declined on average by about

1-2 percentage points during the year. This reduction could

be seen mainly in the priority sectors. The Average Weighted

Lending Rate (AWLR), which is based on the Quarterly

Survey of Bank Advances, declined from 21.1 per cent in

September 1996 to 20.5 per cent in September 1997. This

indicates that the benefit obtained from the SRR reduction

by the banks has still not been fully transferred to their

customers. Hence, the gross interest spread throughout much

of 1997 has been higher than in the previous year.

The Average Prime Lending Rate (AWPR), the rate

which commercial banks apply on loans to their prime

customers, however, declined sharply from 20.2 per cent at

end December 1996 to 14.5 per cent at end December 1997.

The monthly average of the AWPR declined by 4.2

percentage points (18.4 per cent in December 1996 to 14.2

per cent in December 1997). This reveals that prime

customers of commercial banks were the main beneficiaries

of the interest rate reduction during the year. ,

. The inter-bank call market, which provides short-term

working capital for the commercial banks, provided cheaper

funds for the banks in 1997 than in 1996. During the major

part of 1997, call market rates were in the range 9.00-28.00

per cent, in comparison to a range of 9.00-35.00 per cent

in 1996. On a few days in February, April and May, the

rate rose above 20 per cent. An increasing trend' was seen

again in the last 3 weeks of the year following the

uncertainty in the foreign exchange market and the reduction

of market liquidity resulting from the purchase of foreign

exchange by commercial banks from the Central Bank. Call

rates reached 20 per cent at the end of •the year due to a

liquidity shortage, arising from seasonal factors as well as

the behaviour of the exporters and importers reacting to the

regional crisis.

Interest rates charged by FCBUs are based on the

London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Most FCBUs

lend money to their customers at LIBOR plus a mark-up of

1 to 4 percentage points. The deposit rates of FCBUs on

US dollars were 5 to 6 per cent, sterling pounds 6 to 7 per

cent and Deutsche marks around 5 per cent. In case of the

foreign currency loan facility to non-BOI exporters, lending

rates were slightly higher and were in the range 6.26 to

10.50 per cent.

In recent years, commercial paper, which are unsecured

promissory notes, have become a popular financial

instrument in the corporate sector and the commercial

banking sector. The rate on commercial paper was in the

range of 12-24 per cent during the year and many

commercial banks were involved with this business during

the year.

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate, which are

published by the Central Bank under the Civil Procedure

Code (Amendment) Act No .6 of 1990 and in terms of

Section 23 of the Debt Recovery (Special Provision) Act

No.2 of 1990, respectively, were 12.7 per cent in 1997 (18.0

per cent m 1996).

Long-Term Rates

Long-term rates include yields on Government securities

and Treasury bonds, lending rates of specialised banks, and

rates of other long-term credit institutions. The interest rate

on Government securities (Rupee Loans), which are

administratively determined, showed a declining trend in

1997. The rate on Rupee Loans with maturities of 2-4 years

issued during the first five month period declined from 14.5

per cent to 12.50 per cent. Interest rates on Rupee Loans,

of 5-7 years and 6-7 year maturities, which were 14 per cent

in 1996, declined to a 11.25 - 12.25 per cent range during

1997. .

In 1997, the Government introduced a new market oriented medium-term financial instrument, namely Treasury bonds, to the market. The maturity of the Treasury bonds issued ranged from 2 to 4 years. The weighted average yield rate on this new instrument, which started at 14 per cent per annum for 2-year bonds in March, fell to 11.56 per cent by September. The yield on the last issue, a 4-year bond issued in October was 11.36 per cent per annum. These yields are market determined and provided some indication of the movement in long-term rates. The availability of these Treasury bond yields further helps to build up a longer-term yield curve in the financial market, and provides risk free benchmark rates for the private sector.

Interest rate, charged by specialised banks and the other

long-term credit institutions also declined during the year.

The Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon Bank

(DFCC), State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB) and

National Development Bank (NDB) reduced interest rates

from 16.40 - 24.00 per cent in December 1996 to 13.00-

22.00 per cent by December 1997. The lending rates of the

National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) remained

unchanged in the range of 10-15 per cent during the year.

Long-term lending rates of the NSB declined from 17.00-

20.00 per cent in December 1996 to 15.50-16.50 per cent

in December 1997. The rate offered by the SMIB on one

year deposits was reduced from 17 per cent per annum at

the beginning of 1997 to 14 per cent in May and to 11 per

cent in December 1997.

During the year, one listed public company issued long-

term debt instruments (debentures) quoted on the Colombo

Stock Exchange. The debenture interest rate declined from

18 per cent at the beginning of the year to 15 per cent at

the end of 1997, in comparison to an interest rate range of

17.5 - 20.9 per cent for debentures issued in 1996.

10.4 Commercial Banking

With the recovery of the economy in 1997, commercial banks showed an improved performance. The reduction in the SRR increased the loanable funds in commercial banks while enabling them to reduce their lending rates. At the same time, the availability of liquid funds in the market and the decline in yield rates on government, debt instruments led to a reduction in their deposit rates. Commercial banks preferred to invest in low risk government securities rather than lend aggressively to the private sector. Commercial bank holdings of Treasury bills and government securities showed an increase of 41 per cent in 1997 when compared to the increase of 33 per cent in 1996, in spite of the decline in yields. Private sector investors were also cautious about making large scale investments. Credit from the FCBUs to the private sector has expanded. Non-BOI exporters benefited from the new foreign currency loan facility which came into effect from January 1997. Gross lending under this facility amounted to approximately US dollars 254 million.

assets of commercial banks grew by 14 per cent in 1997

compared to a rise of 16 per cent in 1996. Net external

assets increased by RsJ 1,281 - million, in their attempt to

restore foreign assets after a decline in the previous year.

The decline in domestic interest rates, the inflow of foreign

funds through the capital account and the uncertainty in

exchange markets in East Asia have all contributed to

commercial banks improving their net foreign asset position

substantially.

Structure of Assets and Liabilities

The total resources of commercial banks increased by Rs.52,994 million or by 13.6 per cent in 1997, reflected mainly in the growth of loans and advances and foreign currency holdings. Reflecting the economic recovery in 1997, total loans and advances of commercial banks excluding advances to the Government expanded by 13.7 per cent and contributed 51 per cent of the growth of their assets. The increase in foreign assets contributed 38 per cent of the growth in total assets, while also helping to improve the liquidity of banks. The overall liquid asset to total assets ratio increased from 25 per cent in 1996 to 27 per cent in 1997.

Holdings of commercial bills, which consist of export

bills, import bills and local bills grew at a slower rate of

95 per cent in 1997 compared to 26.6 per cent in 1996,

Investments in export bills, however, increased by 12.2 per

cent compared with an increase of 10.6 per cent in 1996.

In line with the slower growth of imports, investments in

import bills increased at a lower rate of 8.7 per cent.

On the liabilities side, a major development was a 7.8 per cent reduction in domestic interbank borrowings, as the liquidity of banks had improved significantly after the reduction in the SRR. In addition there was also a 15.4 per cent growth in deposits compared with a slightly lower rate of expansion of loans and advances. This phenomenon helped to stabilise interest rates.

Capital account balances increased by 13.1 per cent (Rs.5,131 million) in 1997, compared to the 17.3 per cent (Rs.5,778 million) increase in 1996. The banks continued to maintain the ratio of shareholders funds to total assets unchanged at 10 per cent in 1997.

Foreign assets during the year recorded a large increase

of 70.2 per cent compared with only 4 per cent in 1996.

Assets with banks abroad increased from Rs.8,736 million

at end 1996 to Rs.18,260 million at end 1997. Foreign assets

with FCBUs at Rs.12,935 million at end 1996, increased by

76.4 per cent to Rs.22,817 million at end 1997. The capital

inflows that resulted from the privatisation process and the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

compensation paid to Kuwaiti workers, together with the

uncertainty associated with the crisis in currency markets in

East Asia encouraged commercial banks to maintain higher

levels of foreign assets. Moreover, the decline in domestic

interest rates made it much less profitable for commercial

banks to shift their portfolio holdings from foreign currency

to rupees. Foreign liabilities, which consist mainly of Non

Resident Foreign Currency (NRFC), Resident-Non National

Foreign Currency (RNNFC) and Resident Foreign Currency

(RFC) deposits, increased by 21.7 per cent in 1997 compared

to a 15 per cent increase in 1996. The reduction of the

interest rate differential in favour of the domestic currency

deposits caused by the decline in domestic interest rates,

mainly the reduction in Treasury bill yields, together with

the speculation of a large depreciation in the rupee, would

have encouraged these deposit holders to retain their savings

in foreign currency accounts, rather than converting them to

rupees.

As the commercial banks changed the structure of their portfolios of investments by increasing their Treasury bills and Treasury bond holdings from Rs.15,530 million in 1996 to Rs.22,266 million (43.4 per cent increase) in 1997, net credit to government from commercial' banks increased to Rs.l 1,819 million.

Sources and Users of Funds

Reflecting the strong recovery in the economy and the

corresponding increase in economic activity, the total net

availability of resources to the commercial banks rose by

Rs.30,074 million in 1997, in comparison to an increase of

Rs.20,945 million in 1996. As has been the case in the past,

the domestic private sector was the major source of funds,

contributing over half the increase in 1997. In addition, the

Central Bank and other assets and liabilities were important

sources of funds. The government sector and the foreign

sector were the major users of funds.

The domestic private sector continued to be the biggest

source of resources to the commercial banks, providing

Rs.15,081 million of funds. These funds came primarily from

the placement of deposits with the banks. A noteworthy

feature in 1997 was that the Central Bank, which usually

absorbs funds through the imposition of SRR, released funds

to the banks with the reduction in the SRR from 15 per cent

to 12 per cent. The co-operative sector was a net provider'

of resources to the banking system, as in the previous year.

An increase in the capital and reserves held by the banks

and an increase in other liabilities caused other assets and

liabilities to become a net supplier of funds to the banks,

in contrast to 1996, when this sector was a net user of funds.

The major users of funds were the government sector

and the foreign sector. As commercial banks increased their

holdings of government securities and extended additional

credit to the Government through the discounting of import

bills and the provision of short-term credit, the government

sector absorbed 43 per cent of the total increase in

commercial bank resources in 1997. The large reduction in

the differential between domestic interest rates and foreign

interest rates and the uncertainty in foreign exchange markets

due to the East Asian financial crisis in the latter part of

the year encouraged banks to build up their foreign assets,

while increasing their foreign liabilities by a much smaller

amount. Reflecting this significant improvement in the net

foreign asset position of commercial banks, the foreign sector

became a net user of foreign resources. In contrast, this

sector was a net supplier of funds in 1996. Government

corporations too were net users of funds in 1997, whereas

they had been net suppliers in the previous year.

Commercial Bank Loans and Advances1

The Quarterly Survey of commercial banks loans and advances showed little change in the composition of loans and advances. There has been a marginal increase in the share of consumption credit, from 75 per cent to 8.8 per cent of the total. Consumption loans increased by 20.2 per cent compared with 13.4 per cent in 1996. This increase in consumption credit could be attributed to both the reduction in interest rates in 1997 and the increase in income arising from a robust growth in the economy.

Confirming the importance of trading activity to commercial banking, this sector continued to absorb the largest amount of bank credit. The trading sector accounted for 42.4 per cent of the total credit outstanding, as at end September 1997.

The industrial sector was the second largest recipient of credit. Its share in total credit accounted for 12.3 per cent of the total, compared to 13.7 per cent in 1996. It is noteworthy, that a major share of industrial sector credit is now obtained from FCBUs and the two development finance institutions.

Credit to housing and property development fell marginally by 0.6 per cent in the 12-month period ending September 1997, as compared to the 27 per cent growth during the previous period, reflecting reduced investment in this sector. Consequently, its share in total loans decreased slightly from 12.8 per cent at end September 1996 to 12.4 per cent at end September 1997.

In respect of collateral, 89 per cent of the loans were

secured, while 25 per cent of the total loans were issued

1 The analysis is based on data for the first three quarters of 1997.

per cent of the loans were covered by personal guarantees

and promissory.notes.

The maturity structure reflected a slight increase in

short-term credit from 64.4 per cent to 65.2 per cent of the

total.

Foreign Currency Banking Units

Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) expanded

more vigorously in 1997 than in 1996. As in 1996, 26

FCBUs were in operation in 1997. However, the total assets/

liabilities increased by 26 per cent, in comparison to an

increase of only 1.6 per cent in 1996. Both the international

activities of FCBUs and their interaction with the domestic

economy grew in 1997, in comparison to 1996 when

activities had been at a comparatively low level. FCBUs

obtained significant amounts of resources from resident

sources, as well as non-resident sources. Foreign currency

deposits with domestic banking units and deposits by BOI

enterprises were the main avenues of obtaining funds from

resident sources, both banks and non-banks were non-resident

sources. These funds were deployed by FCBUs in two major

areas, viz., investments with non-resident enterprises and

loans and advances to BOI enterprises. The net foreign

liabilities of FCBUs (i.e., net liabilities to non-residents)

declined from US dollars 109.5 million at end 1996 to US

dollars 20.4 million at end 1997, which is a considerable

improvement. At end 1997, 41 per cent of the assets of

FCBUs were placed with non-residents, while 42 per cent

of the liabilities were to non-residents.

Total gross assets of FCBUs increased by US dollars

233.8 million to US dollars 1,663.4 million. Of this

increase, 63 per cent was due to an increase in claims on

non-residents. Placements with banks abroad represented 80

per cent of the increase in claims on non-residents while the

balance 20 per cent were claims on non-banks. It is

important to monitor carefully the changes in the net

liabilities (or net exposure) of FCBUs, particularly with non­

residents, as well as the asset quality. In addition, as the

FCBUs are increasingly being integrated with the domestic

economy as more and more enterprises are entitled to FCBU

facilities, prudential norms will have to be set to help

improve their performance.

FCBUs continued to be a significant source of funds to

BOI enterprises, thus fulfilling one of the purposes for which

these Units were permitted to be established. Credit provided

to BOI enterprises increased by 28.4 per cent (US dollars

117-9 million) in 1997. Credit to other approved enterprises,

however, decreased by 13.3 per cent (US dollars 31.4

million), primarily on account of reduced credit to public

corporations. A sum of US dollars 4.2 million had been

extended by FCBUs to non-BOI exporters under the special

scheme which commenced in January 1997 with the

implementation of the 1997 Budget proposal to extend

foreign currency loans to non-BOI enterprises. Most of the

loans under that facility, however, were extended through the

domestic units, rather than through FCBUs.

On the liabilities side, 39 per cent of the increase was

to non-residents and the balance increase was largely on

account of placement of funds by domestic units. This

increase was US dollars 141 million. Liabilities to BOI

enterprises increased by US dollars 60.2 million, while the

liabilities to other approved (non-BOI) organisations declined

by US dollars 18 million.

10.5 Central Banking

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, continued to perform

its functions throughout 1997 to achieve.its objectives of

maintaining the internal and external stability of the rupee

and promoting economic growth. In particular, the Bank

worked to ensure the availability of money and credit and

stabilise their cost in the economy throughout 1997 in line

with national macro economic objectives. In this regard, a

substantial reduction in the cost of money (interest rates),

with minimising of volatility, could be regarded as important

achievements of the Central Bank during the year.

The major changes in the Central Bank's balance sheet

reflect these developments. Deposit liabilities of the Central

Bank declined by 4.1 per cent during 1997. This is mainly

due to some adjustment made to the SRR by the Central

Bank in early 1997. Due to the above developments the base

money decreased by 2.1 per cent in comparison to a rise of

8.8 per cent in 1996. .

Structure of Assets and Liabilities

The total resources of the Central Bank at Rs.l83,895

million at end December 1997 recorded a marginal increase

of 1.3 per cent (Rs.2,332 million) during the. year compared

to a moderate increase of 4.6 per cent (Rs.8,053 million) in

1996.

Viewed from the assets side, the increase was entirely

in foreign assets of the Central Bank. Reflecting a favourable

improvement in the balance of payments, the foreign assets

of the Bank reached Rs.l 18,999 million recording a

Rs.l5,755 million increase (15.3 per cent) during 1997. In

1996, foreign assets declined by Rs.2,652 million (2.5 per

cent). The growth in foreign assets mainly reflected the

proceeds from the Government's privatisation programme.

Domestic assets of the Central Bank recorded a decrease

of Rs.l ,423 million (77 per cent) in 1997 compared to an

increase of Rs.10,710 million (15.8 per cent) in 1996. A

decline in the fiscal deficit, better cash management of the

Treasury and receipts from the Government privatisation

programme reduced borrowings by the Government from the

Central Bank during 1997, thus helping to reduce the

inflationary pressure in the economy. Loans and advances to

the Government increased by 2.2 per cent (Rs.614 million)

in 1997. The Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank

declined by 58 per cent (Rs.9,878 million) compared to an

increase of 37 per cent in 1996. The decline was mainly due

to the retirement of Rs.10,000 million worth of bills by the

Government using the proceeds received under privatisation.

On the liabilities side, total deposit liabilities of the

Central Bank recorded a 4 per cent (Rs.3,277 million)

decline during 1997 entirely reflecting a decline in

commercial bank deposits by 15 per cent..Despite an

increase in customer deposits with commercial banks in

1997, the statutory reserves held by these banks with the

Central Bank declined as a consequence of the reduction in

the SRR in the early part of 1997. As a part of the

privatisation proceeds obtained by the Government was

retained as deposits to avoid destabilising the money market,

Government deposits with the Central Bank increased by

Rs.2,910 million.

Total currency issues by the Bank during the year

increased by 7.4 per cent (Rs.3,655 million) compared to a

6 per cent (Rs.2,796 million) increase in 1996. A greater

usage of currency notes by the public was seen in 1997. The

note issue increased by 7.5 per cent in 1997 compared to

6.0 per cent in 1996. Coin demand recorded an increase

of 7.8 per cent (Rs.150 million) in 1997 in comparison to

6.4 per cent (Rs.l 15 million) in 1996.

10.6 Banking Development

A new foreign bank, Societe Generale, commenced its

operations in Colombo while Indo-Suez Bank Ltd. ceased its

operations and was taken over by Hatton National Bank Ltd.

The total number of commercial banks operating in the

country at end 1997 stood at 26, consisting of 2 state banks,

6 domestic private banks and 18 foreign banks.'Another

important development that took place in the banking field

was the establishment of two Licensed Specialised Banks

(LSBs), namely, Sanasa Development Bank and Pramuka

Savings and Development Bank, to engage in savings and

development banking.

Branch Expansion

An upsurge was seen in bank branch expansion in 1997.

The steady growth of opportunities in the financial sector and

the expansion of activities of non-commercial bank financial

institutions had led to intensified competition among banks.

The total number of commercial bank branches including

main branches (excluding 171 pawning centres), Agrarian

Services Centre (ASC) branches, Kachcheri branches,

extension offices and overseas branches increased to 996 at

end 1997, from 958 at end 1996. The increase in branch

network mainly arose through the opening of 26 branches

by domestic private banks. The opening of 12 branches by

Hatton National Bank Ltd. (HNB) and 8 branches by

Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. increased their main

branches to 84 and 28, respectively. Sampath Bank Ltd.

opened 3 branches during the year thus raising its branch

166

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

network to 30 including 2 extension offices. Union Bank

Ltd. set up two branches, while Pan Asia Bank Ltd.

established one branch during the year. However, the main

branches of People's Bank (PB) and Bank of Ceylon (BoC)

remained unchanged at 325 and 275, respectively. The total

number of foreign bank branches including extension/sub

offices increased from 39 to 42 with the opening of a branch

by Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corporation the

establishment of Societe Generate Bank, the opening of two

extension offices by foreign banks and closing of the

Indosuez Bank. In addition, PB opened 70 pawning centres

during the year. With the expansion in the branch network,

the number of persons served by a commercial bank branch

(excluding pawning centres) declined from 19,182 in 1996

to 18,750 persons in 1997.

RRDB increased to 176 with the opening of one new branch

in 1997. The National Savings Bank established 2 hew

branches, thus raising the total number of branches to 99 in

the year of its silver jubilee.

Banking Facilities

Automation and innovation increased in the banking sector, further enhancing the quality of facilities provided by commercial banks to customers. In addition to providing a

wide range of innovative deposit products and lending facilities, commercial banks extended their services in areas such as endorsing, guaranteeing and underwriting commercial paper, leasing, pawn broking, tele-banking, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), credit cards and debit cards facilities and electronic money transfers.

Most commercial banks have computerised their

activities. Commercial Bank of Ceylon implemented a

programme named 'ComServe' which offers on line cash

management services. This helps customers to access their

accounts at any time' during the day via personal computers

installed in their offices. Standard Chartered Bank offered

tele-banking facilities which allows customers to

communicate with banks to obtain a wide array of basic

banking services.

The ATM network expanded while services provided

through ATMs also increased during the year. Overseas Trust

Bank expanded its services by installing an ATM. There

were 38 new ATMs installed during the year, thus raising

the total number of ATMs to 197, installed by ten

commercial banks. Moving a step further towards a cashless

society, Sampath Bank Ltd. launched the SET/CIRRUS/

MAESTRO debit card which is an improved version of its

existing SET card which was launched ten years ago. This

is a convenient way to access deposit accounts. The new

card can be used to pay for goods and services on line by

directly debiting a card holder's bank account at Point of

Sale (POS) machines installed in merchant outlets, t h e new

card also provides access to the global ATM network of

"CIRRUS" which would facilitate card holders to withdraw

money from any ATM displaying the "CIRRUS" logo in any

country in the currency of that country. With this linkage

with the international debit card marketer "CIRRUS/

MAESTRO", ATMs installed by the Sampath Bank Ltd. also

joined their world wide network. In addition, foreigners

having the "CIRRUS/MAESTRO" facility can use the

facilities in Sri Lanka.

By end 1997, nine commercial banks were issuing credit cards. These banks were issuing well known brands of cards, i.e., Master Card, Visa Card and American Express, which can be used both locally and internationally. At end 1997, the total number of credit cards issued by 9 banks was approximately 53,000, of which approximately 30jj0O could be used only for local transactions while the rest were meant for both local and international transactions. Total outstanding credit as at end 1997 was Rs.875 million and the rate of interest charged on credit cards was around 30 per cent. There are differences between a credit card and a debit card. Credit card is a form of short-term credit facility with a limit that can be enjoyed by card holders who are not necessarily account holders. A credit card holder can

167

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

make purchases on credit as well as obtain cash advances

from the bank and interest is charged by the bank for such

facilities. Only an account holder is eligible to obtain a debit

card, which allows card holders to pay for purchases at

merchant outlets by debiting his account instantly while no

credit is provided.

Deviating from traditional activities, commercial banks

expanded their leasing and pawn broking facilities. HNB

introduced foreign currency leasing facilities in 1997 to meet

the needs of BOI enterprises. Leasing facilities were provided

in US dollars, Sterling pounds, Deutsche marks and French

francs. HNB also introduced a "Gold Certificate" against the

value of gold jewellery deposited by customers. Holders of

the Certificate are entitled to obtain 75 per.cent of the value

of the Certificate as a loan. Pan Asia Bank Ltd. entered the

pawning business during the year. People's Bank expanded

its pawning activities through the establishment of 70 new

pawning centres.

Commercial banks also expanded their traditional forms of business. New deposit products which were linked to credit schemes or targetted to specific groups of people, were introduced. New loan schemes for various purposes such as housing, agriculture and self employment commenced. "Kantha Ran Divimaga", a special credit scheme which is linked to a "Kantha Ran Ginum" savings programme, was inaugurated by Seylan Bank Ltd. to set up, improve or expand micro enterprises in small scale industries, handicrafts, trade, animal husbandry, agriculture etc. Another special loan scheme for women who go to Brunei or the Seychelles for employment has been commenced by People's Bank. HNB introduced a new deposit scheme named "Saubhagya". The new scheme is designed to enable depositors to make regular deposits for a period of sixty months and is linked to a loan facility. Another loan scheme was launched by Seylan Bank, called the "Tikiri" Loan Scheme, under which credit facilities have been provided to "Tikiri" Savings Account holders, i.e. children, for higher education and self employment.

Seylan Bank Ltd. introduced a new deposit scheme

named "Rewards Plus 3". Account holders who meet certain

requirements specified by the bank are eligible to lucky

draws and are entitled to receive rewards plus cards. The

owners of reward plus cards would enjoy facilities such as

concessions on commissions charged on travellers' cheques

and bank drafts, interest rate rebates on loans, free cheque

books etc. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation

Ltd. introduced a personal loan scheme for its customers

employed by Hong Kong Bank approved employers for the

purpose of financing expenses on overseas travel, family

weddings, home improvement and other household expenses.

Under this scheme, the borrower will be able to borrow up

to six times the monthly salary, with a repayment period of 3 years. PB introduced two loan schemes, one for consumption purposes and the other a loan scheme for pensioners. Pan Asia Bank implemented a new savings scheme ''Sovereign Accounts", while PB introduced a new deposit scheme named "Pranama" savings scheme, which is linked to a loan scheme. Meanwhile, Citibank N.A. introduced a loan scheme named Vendor Financing to finance the imports of garment exporters.

Commercial Bank introduced the "Nivahana" housing loan scheme. A loan scheme was implemented by Seylan Bank , named the "Piyasa" housing loan scheme, to provide credit facilities for housing purposes. The maximum amount granted under this scheme is Rs.10 million and it carries an interest rate in the range of 17-19 per cent. PB granted a loan facility for housing purposes to the people resettled in Jaffna, while another housing loan scheme was initiated by PB for rehabilitation of houses which were affected by the civil disturbances.

Short-term loan facilities have been granted by Seylan Bank Ltd. for maize cultivation in the Anuradhapura and. Badulla districts and for cashew processing in selected areas of the country. "Ran Govi Thanpath Ginum", a special deposit scheme for farmers, was implemented by BoC in the North Central Province in order to encourage the savings and thrift habits of farmers. This has been extended in other provinces as well. A Credit scheme was launched by the BoC in the Anuradhapura and Moneragala districts to grant financial assistance to farmer organisations and community based organisations for on lending to their member farmers for the cultivation of soya beans. A special loan scheme for farmers in Jaffna was introduced by BoC to provide credit facilities for cultivation of paddy and other subsidiary crops. In addition, BoC implemented the Tea Shakthi savings mobilisation programme, while HNB introduced a credit scheme for sugar cane cultivation.

Self-employment project loans and the Singer sewing machine project loans were launched by Seylan Bank Ltd. in selected areas. These loans are granted against personal guarantees and carried an interest rate of 23 per cent. Further, Seylan Bank introduced the pottery producer loan scheme and the "Seylan Sarusara" loan scheme during the year.

10.7 Credit Information Bureau

Though the Credit Information Bureau incurred heavy

financial expenses in 1996, 1997 was a successful year for

the Bureau. The Bureau supplied 102,175 credit reports

during 1997 to its shareholders. The report floors for loans

remained unchanged at Rs.100,000 for irregular loan

accounts and Rs.500,000 for regular loan accounts. The

updating of irregular loans continued to be on a monthly

168

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

basis. The updating of regular loans of non-Western Province state banks was on a quarterly basis, while for Western Province state banks, it was on a monthly basis.

In the latter part of 1997, the Bureau started collecting information on loans/facilities granted by Foreign Currency Banking Units of licensed commercial banks and information on finance leases granted by leasing units of the commercial banks and finance companies in order to improve the coverage of data and for better credit evaluation. The Bureau is considering the need to enrol leasing companies registered under the proposed leasing law as members of the Bureau!

In 1997, on the request of the Task Force for Security and Risk Management for Credit Card Centres, the Bureau commenced maintaining a database of delinquent credit card holders to which lending institutions have access when processing an application.

During the year another licensed commercial bank was admitted as a shareholder of the Bureau, bringing the total number of shareholders to 59.

10.8 Rural Banking and Credit

Overall Trends and Developments

The programme for generating, self-employment opportunities among the rural poor came of age in 1997 with

the successful completion of the Small Farmers and the

Landless Credit Project (Isuru Project), a pilot credit scheme

for the rural poor introduced in 1989. Under these

arrangements, provision of credit is preceded by a social

mobilisation programme, the main elements of which are the

encouragement of beneficiaries to form themselves into self-

help groups, a compulsory savings programme and the

provision of opportunities to improve their trade and

vocational skills. The completion of this process of social

mobilisation makes the otherwise unbankable rural poor

creditworthy and acceptable to formal lending institutions

which normally have to strike a balance between the credit

risk and their social responsibilities when extending credit

to the rural sector. The Isuru Project, operated in partnership

with the Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) and

a host of development oriented non-governmental

organisations (NGOs), was successful in establishing a cost-

effective credit delivery system for the poor in rural areas.

The experiences of this Project can now be replicated and

adopted by other institutions and agencies which are engaged

in credit activities in the rural sector.

The strategy of the Government to gradually move away

from state-funded rural credit schemes to a system of self-

funding credit schemes in the rural sector was further

reinforced during 1997. The agricultural credit scheme

covering paddy and subsidiary food crops was continued by

lending banks using- their own funds and with the support of an interest subsidy provided by the Government. Similarly, the Surathura Scheme - Phase I, a micro-finance scheme for generating self-employment among the unemployed, funded out of a budgetary allocation of Rs.350 million, was converted in Phase II to a bank funded scheme with an interest subsidy during the year.

Several institutional changes were effected in 1997. The Regional Development Bank (RDB) Act was enacted in Parliament amalgamating the district based Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) into province-based Regional Development Banks (RDBs). This reform is expected to re­capitalise RRDBs, expand their resource and operational base, strengthen internal control systems, inject professionalism to management and broad-base ownership. In addition, two privately owned rural based specialised banks were also licensed by the Central Bank during 1997: the Sanasa Development and Savings Bank and the Pramuka Development and Savings Bank.

The informal self-help groups of the Isuru Project were formalised by establishing Isuru Development Societies

which are limited liability corporate bodies registered with

the Registrar of Companies under the Societies Ordinance.

During 1997, 110 such development societies were set up,

with an issued share capital of Rs.l.3 million and 3,500

shareholders. Similarly, the number of Samurdhi Bank

Societies increased from 125 at end 1996 to 261 at end

1997. Hatton National Bank (HNB), a private commercial

bank, continued to expand its Garni Pubuduwa Scheme in

partnership with NGOs and self-help groups (SHGs).

Janashakthi Banking Societies in Hambantota, another

people-based organisation composed exclusively of women,

expanded their activities considerably during the year. The

expansion of these people-based organisations at the grass­

roots level can be viewed as a salutary development, since

they would fill the vacuum created by the withdrawal of

direct Government participation in the rural credit system,

on the one hand, and establish a viable institutional system

at the grassroots level with which formal lending banks could

collaborate when extending rural credit in the future, on the

• other.

New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS)

The value of credit disbursed by banks under the

NCRCS in 1997 amounted to Rs.586 million, roughly the

same level as in 1996. Of the total credit disbursed, Rs.398

million was for Maha 1996/97, while the balance Rs.188

million was in respect of Yala 1997. Although the value of

loans granted in 1997 remained static compared to the

previous year, the number of loans granted declined from

30,816 in 1996 to 28,643 in 1997. As usual, the major share

of credit (70 per cent) was absorbed by paddy, leaving the

balance for subsidiary food crops.

The Government continued to pay the interest subsidy

of 7.5 percentage points per annum for cultivation loans

under the NCRCS to enable the lending banks to lend their

own funds to farmers at an interest rate of 16 per cent per

annum. The interest subsidy so paid to banks in 1997 in

respect of loans granted during Yala 1994 and Yala 1996

amounted to Rs.3 million.

The payment of compensation to banks under the

Farmers' Relief Scheme introduced by the Government in

1994 was continued during the year under review. Under this

scheme, defaulting fanners between Yala 1986 and Maha

1993/94 have been offered relief under the Government's

relief package subject to the condition that the farmer agrees

to make a down payment of 25 per cent of the amount in

default to the respective lending bank. The Government's

relief package required the Central Bank to relax its credit

guarantee rules by waiving the requirement that a bank

should institute legal action in order to be eligible for the

full amount of the credit guarantee. In terms of this waiver,

the Central Bank agreed to pay half of the principal amount

of the loss remaining after the collection of the advance of

25 per cent from the farmers. During 1997, the Central Bank

paid Rs.83.3 million to the RRDBs as the Central Bank's

share under the Relief Scheme. The Government absorbed

a sum of Rs33.2 miUion as its share on account of the loans

written-off by the RRDBs under the scheme.

Crop Insurance Schemes

During the year under review, the Agricultural Insurance

Board (AIB) continued to offer its agricultural insurance

schemes for paddy, other agricultural food crops and

livestock. A special insurance scheme was implemented for

paddy farmers in Farmers' Organisations in the Mahaweli

areas. Another insurance scheme, titled 'Sarubima Scheme',

was implemented in a selected village in each electorate with

the assistance of governmental and non-governmental

organisations. One of the objectives of this scheme is to

enroll all the farmers in the age group of 18 - 59 years in

selected villages in a Farmers' Pension Scheme, so that they

could earn a permanent monthly income after 60 years of

age and offer them a free insurance cover worth Rs.50,000.

In addition, the other insurance schemes for paddy, livestock,

coconut, fruits (pineapples) and flowers (anthuriums) will

also be implemented in these villages. The Ceylinco

Insurance Company Ltd. (CICL), the only private insurance

company operating in this field, continued to offer insurance

schemes for agriculture during the year under review.

The extent of paddy land insured by the AIB in 1997

was 21,000 hectares recording a 19 per cent decrease when

compared with the previous year. At the same time, the area

insured by CICL has increased by 34 per cent between the

two years. The premia collected by the AIB in 1997

amounted to Rs.12.8 million while indemnities paid

amounted to Rs. 5.6 million. The CICL collected premia for

paddy amounting to Rs.0.46 million and paid compensation

to the value of Rs.0.10 million. In the case of the other

crops, the AIB collected premia amounting to Rs.0.79 million

in 1997 and paid indemnities to a value of Rs.0.36 million.

The comparable figures for CICL were Rs.l.5 million and

Rs. 0.14 million, respectively. In the livestock insurance

scheme of the AIB, the covered animals were cows, goats

and calves. The total premia collected for livestock amounted

to Rs. 1.8 million, while the indemnities paid were Rs.0.80

million. As a whole, the agricultural and livestock insurance

schemes offered by both AIB and CICL have continued to

expand in terms of coverage in the recent past.

Micro Finance and Savings Schemes

Self-Employment Promotion through Micro-Enterprises Credit (Surathura Scheme)

The Surathura Programme inaugurated in September

1996 by the Government, aimed at providing micro-finance

to the educated unemployed to undertake self-employment

income generating activities. A sum of Rs.350 million was

allocated by the Government for refinancing the Surathura

loans granted by the three Participating Credit Institutions

(PCIs), viz., Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank and Hatton

National Bank. The scheme was operated throughout the

island.

The entirety of the allocation of Rs.350 million was

fully utilised by the 3 PCIs during the year to extend 9,059

loans to the target group. These collateral-free loans, with

an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum and a maturity of

3 years, enabled youths to commence new projects or expand

their existing businesses mainly in trade and commerce,

micro industrial activities; agriculture and livestock

development. An islandwide sample survey conducted by the

171

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - .1997

Central Bank in April 1997 revealed that 88 per cent of the

borrowers had utilised the loan proceeds for the intended

project, while 12 per cent of borrowers had misused funds.

With the high demand for such micro loans continuing unabated, the Government introduced Phase II of the Surathura Scheme in September 1997 with a target of 10,000 further loans to a value of Rs.500 million. However, in line with the Government's policy to convert gradually such state funded credit schemes to. self-funding schemes, Phase II was designed to be funded by the 3 PCIs out of their own resources. Taking into account the concessionary interest rate of 10 per cent per annum and the high transactions costs and credit risks involved in micro loans, the Government agreed to support PCIs with an interest subsidy of 10 per cent per annum on every performing loan. At end 1997, 4,542 loans to a value of Rs.171 million, had been.granted by PCIs under Phase II of the Surathura Scheme.

Samurdhi Development Credit Scheme or SASANA Scheme

The Sasana Scheme, which was inaugurated in 1996,

also aimed at promoting income generating self-employment

opportunities among Samurdhi beneficiaries so as to raise

their income levels, and thereby make them self-reliant and

self-supporting. Under this Scheme, Samurdhi beneficiaries

are eligible to obtain loans of up to Rs.10,000 for

undertaking new income generating activities or expanding

an existing business. During 1997, 4,990 sewing machines

were distributed among selected Samurdhi families to enable

them to commence small scale garment industries by using

textile offcuts of large garment factories, in the initial stage.

As a part of the Samurdhi Movement, Samurdhi Bank

Societies (SBSs) were setup throughout the country to

promote savings and disburse credit. At end 1997, 261 such

SBSs had been established, consisting of 68,577 Self Help

Groups (SHGs) with a total membership of 404,738. Each

SHG maintained its own savings fund that collected sayings

on a weekly basis. These savings, which were placed as

deposits in SBSs, amounted to Rs.49.2 million at the end

of 1997.

An issue that may arise with the placement of such

savings with unregulated and unsupervised informal societies

will be the consequential risk to which the savers are

exposed. Hence, it is of utmost importance to take

precautionary measures by linking these SBSs to a state bank

and placing the funds in deposit with such a bank.

Gami Pubuduwa Scheme : An Experiment in Linkage Banking

Linkage banking is a novel method developed by banks

for extending micro credit to a large number of retail

borrowers by .engaging the services of a community based

voluntary organisation as an intermediary to link the

borrowers to the bank. It helps the lending banks to lower

transaction costs, reduce credit risks and reach a normally

unbankable clientele in the rural sector. Lending banks have

thus been able to tap the business potential in the rural sector

and contribute to a balanced development in different sectors

of the economy.

Hatton National Bank (HNB) experimented with a

hybrid of linkage banking by inaugurating its Gami

Pubuduwa Scheme (GPS) in 1989. In this scheme, HNB has

successfully gone into partnership with a number of NGOs

and SHGs, which introduce potential borrowers to the bank,

monitor loans and take follow up action and help the bank

to recover the loans on the due dates. The GPS is operated

and directed by specially trained permanent officers attached

to the relevant branch of the Bank. At the end of 1997, the

GPS had covered 93 villages reaching 23,011 borrowers with

a total loan portfolio of Rs.608.5 million. The overall

recovery rate in GPS at 97 per cent has been well above

the normal recovery performance of banks in rural lending

in the country.

Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies (TCCSs) Credit Scheme

TCCSs, popularly known as SANASA Societies,

perform a useful function in the rural sector by mobilising

funds from the rural population for developmental purposes,

raising rural savings and extending micro and small loans

to members. It also functions as a linkage agency in rural

lending by going into partnership with a number of national

and regional credit schemes. The culmination of SANASA

activities was witnessed in 1997 when the SANASA Savings

and Development Bank was set up as a specialised banking

institution.

At the end of 1997, SANASA had disbursed loans

amounting to Rs.2,181 million and mobilised savings

amounting to Rs.2,807 million. Both these have recorded a

progressive increase over the past few years. By making a

concerted effort in loan monitoring and taking follow up

action, SANASA has been successful in maintaining a very

high loan recovery rate of 85 per cent.

Janashakthi Banking Societies in Hambantota

Janashakthi Banking Societies (JBSs), which are informal savings and loan associations, were set up in 1989 by the Women's Development Federation (WDF) in Hambantota with the objective of empowering the women in poor families in the area to become both socially and economically self-reliant. To achieve this objective,

172

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

participating women are put through an awareness

programme on health, nutrition, thrift and viable economic

activities. Savings are mobilised as an integral part of the

programme and re-lent to women members at above market

rates (36 per cent per annum) to enable them to undertake

micro-scale income generating activities. At the end of 1997,

there were 67 JBSs with 26,000 members spread over 463

villages in 5 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in Hambantota.

During 1997, JBSs mobilised savings amounting to Rs.

10.6 million raising the total savings to Rs.44.6 million by

the end of the year. Total loans disbursed during the year

amounted to Rs. 268.8 million in respect of predominantly

agricultural, trading, fisheries and livestock activities. With

concerted supervisory and follow up action, JBSs managed

to maintain a recovery rate of 100 per cent during the year.

Sarvodaya Economic Enterprises Development Services (SEEDS)

Sarvodaya Economic Enterprises Development Services

(SEEDS), which is the economic arm of the Lanka Jathika

Sarvodaya Shramadana Sangamaya (SSS), is a pioneer in

rural economic development through peoples' participation.

This was established as a separate division of SSS in 1986.

The mission of SEEDS is to alleviate poverty among the

rural poor in Sri Lanka by raising the economic conditions

and income levels of the membership of the SSS, to

strengthen each SSS to become a self reliant, self funding

and self managing institution and ensure their sustainability

as alternative development institutions. This programme,

operated in 18 districts, covers 2,083 shramadana societies.

SEEDS also functions as a link, institution in the credit

schemes implemented by the Central Bank, National

Development Trust Fund (NDTF) and the National

Development Bank (NDB). At the end of 1997, SEEDS had

disbursed 17,246 loans to a value of Rs.l,010 million^

maintaining a recovery rate of 89 per cent.

Tea Shakthi Movement (TSM)

The Tea Shakthi Movement (TSM) is a scheme

inaugurated by the Tea Small Holding Development

Authority (TSHDA) in 1989 in collaboration with the Bank

of Ceylon to raise the fund base of the Tea Small Holder

Societies (TSHSs) and thereby make them self-reliant and

sustainable. These societies were formed by TSHDA under

the Small Holder Tea Development Project (SHTDA) funded

by the ADB.

Under the scheme, every tea smallholder is encouraged

to save the value of at least 1 kilogram of green leaves per

week so that, in lean years they have accumulated savings

to fall back on. These savings are, in turn, deposited by

TSHSs with the BOC, which functions as the banker to the

scheme. To enhance the range of benefits, the TSM has

introduced a free life and accident insurance scheme and a

pension scheme for tea smallholders. In addition, opportunity

has been afforded to them to participate in equity in related

projects involving green leaf transportation, private tea

factories and tea packing plants. As at end 1997, 75,000 tea

smallholders had joined the TSM with a total savings of

Rs.75 million.

10.9 Other Financial Institutions

Savings Institutions

The National Savings Bank (NSB), the premier savings

institution in Sri Lanka, celebrated its silver jubilee in 1997.

It increased its deposit base by 17 per cent to Rs.77,865

million, while its total assets reached Rs.83,775 million at

end 1997, displaying its financial stability and strength in a

competitive banking environment. Attractive interest rates,

together with large advertisement campaigns and the'

implementation of new deposit instruments/schemes

contributed to the deposit growth of the bank. The NSB

mobilised savings through already existing instruments such

as pass book savings, fixed deposits, pension schemes,

endowment schemes, premium savings bonds and also

through new deposit schemes namely 'Ridee Reka' and

'National Savings Certificates'. Fixed deposits increased by

Rs.6,545 million or 16 per cent, while savings deposits

increased by Rs.3,788 million or 15 per cent during the year.

This compares with a 9 per cent increase in fixed deposits

and a 26 per cent increase in saving deposits of commercial

banks. Other deposits of the NSB, which include National

Savings Certificates, Savings Certificates, Premium Savings

Bonds, and the NSB Pension Scheme, rose from Rs.98

million to Rs.794 million.

NSB interest rates were revised downward several times in line with trends in the market. Interest rates on savings deposits were reduced from 12 per cent at the beginning of 1997 to 10.8 per cent in May. Interest rates on one year fixed deposits paid at maturity decreased from 15 per cent to 14 per cent in March, to 13.2 per cent in May, to 12.0 per cent in August and to 11.0 pet cent in November 1997.

Amendments made to the NSB Act allowed

diversification of the investment portfolio of the bank. Total

investments of the bank increased to Rs. 73,771 million,

which reflected an increase of Rs. 10,241 million for the year.

Investment in government and government guaranteed

securities continued to dominate the investment portfolio and

amounted to Rs.62,217 million, representing 84 per cent of

the total investments. Within the government securities, the

NSB has moved more towards market oriented securities

(i.e.Treasury bills and Treasury bonds) in its new investments

reducing its allocation for investment in Rupee Securities.

The Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), the country's

main superannuation fund and the largest single investor in

the market has undergone modernisation during the year

through the establishment of electronic systems. The total

members' balance of the EPF increased by approximately 20

per cent to Rs.104 billion. The total contributions received

by the EPF amounted to Rs.9,763 million compared to Rs.

9,302 million in 1996. Refunds paid to members increased

by 30 per cent to Rs.4,576 million. The total investments

of the Fund increased by Rs.23,212 million and stood at

Rs.137,584 million at end 1997. The EPF invested

Rs.135,104 million in government paper which accounted for

98 per cent of total investments.

The Employees' Trust Fund (ETF) recorded a significant growth in 1997 with improved resources and activities. Total assets of the Fund reached Rs.19,676 million at end 1997, which reflected an increase of Rs.2,552 million for the year. Total contributions received by the ETF rose by Rs.263 million in 1997, while outstanding members' balances in the Fund increased by 6 per cent to Rs.l7,853 million. Total superannuation benefits paid to members during 1997 amounted to Rs.936 million. The total number of ETF member accounts was approximately 2.2 million, of which 1.7 million were active accounts. There were 26,427 employers contributing to the Fund in 1997 compared with 27 780 in 1996. The total investments of the Fund increased by 18 per cent and stood at Rs.l8,698 million by end 1997. As in the previous years, the major share of investments was

in the category of government paper, which accounted for

66 per cent of total investments at end 1997. Investments

in Rupee Securities increased significantly by Rs.2,254

million or 94 per cent, while investments in Treasury bills

and Treasury bonds rose by 11 per cent in response to the

decision taken by the Fund to invest in longer term

instruments as a hedge against a downturn in interest rates.

Investments in shares, which accounted for 16 per cent of

the total investments in 1997, also rose substantially by

Rs.l,092 million or 55 per cent over the previous year, while

investments in Unit Trusts also increased by 12 per cent

during the year. Investments in debentures rose by 10 per

cent to Rs.l,539 million and amounted to 8 per cent of total

investments at end 1996. Meanwhile, investments in asset

backed notes and commercial paper were Rs. 99 million and

Rs. 24 million, respectively, at end 1997.

Long-term Lending Institutions

The total number of long-term lending institutions

increased to 8 with the establishment of two licensed

specialised banks, namely, Sanasa Development Bank Ltd.

and Pramuka Savings and Development Bank Ltd.

The DFCC Bank, one of the major development finance

institutions, enhanced its development banking activities by

providing medium and long-term credit for industrialists with

a view to boosting medium and small enterprises. Total loans

approved by the DFCC Bank increased from Rs.4,259

million in respect of 878 loans to Rs.6,631 million for 1.066

loans in 1997. Total loans granted by the DFCC Bank grew

by 29 per cent to Rs.3,684 million. The bulk of loan

facilities provided by the DFCC Bank was obtained by the

industrial sector. During the year, Rs.3,806 million was

Non-Bank Financial Institutions

The definition of non-bank or 'other" financial institutions (OFIs) varies ftom country to country Generally, they are defined in an indnect way as all those institutions which do not conduct 'banking business' or all those financial intermediaries which arc not 'banking institutions'. However, as commercial banks also divcisity their activities from traditional banking practii.es to activities such as leasing, direct pioject fmam.c and equity funding. the major differences between commercial banks and OFIs have been gradually fading.

In the current Sri Lankan context. OFIs can broadly be identified as follows :

- deposit taking institutions (National Savings Bank, finance companies, RRDBs) - long-term lending institutions (SMIB. DFCC,

The history of OFIs dates back lo the late lvih Century with the setting up of savings institutions, such a"; the Ceylon Savings Bank (1832), the Post Office Savings Bank (IS85) and small Thrift and Ciedit Co­operative Societies (1906) in the early 20th Century Although those OFIs weie initially meant to enhance savings and inculcate thrift habits through the acceptance of interest bearing term deposits from the public for lending, with the sophistication in financial facilities and services, their horizons weie broadened. Typically, OFIs flourish in open economies Thus, with the increasing control of the economy by the State in the 1960s and 1970s, their activities declined. Ho*cvcr. the Government itself and some public sector institutions did set up some public sector OFIs, such a* Co-opcrauve Rural Banks, the National Savings Bank and the Insurance Corporation of Sii Linka, during this period. Following the economic policy reforms in 1977. die private sector took the initiative in establishing different types of OFIs to cater to varying needs of society. The expansion in finance companies and the emergence of meicltant banks, ventuic Ldprtal companies, iwsmg companies and money brokcts have been the result of this trend. This ted to a more dynamic financial system and improved the quality and the efficiency of the financial intermediation process.

As economic development occurs in any economy, in particular, one that follows free matket principles, the needs of its vauous sectors increase and become more

complex and specialised. In order to meet these growing rcquiicments. new facilities and institutions should spring up as the traditional hanking system is inadequate to piovidc all these requirements. This is seen in Sn Lanka

as well. The non-avMilability or credit from the traditional financial sector to certain calegoi ie.s of borrowers due to either the nature of the business of such borrowers* or the non-acceptability of the collateial they could provide, contubuicd to the rapid growth of finance companies. The development of the money market, the secondary market in government securities and the stock market led to the cmeigcncc and expansion of merchant banks, venture capital companies, money brokcts and share brokcts They play a significant role m the economy, performing functions siidi as deposit mobilisation, lending (shoit, medium and long-term), hiic purchase, rc-fmancc and leasing, granting rural credit, project financing, loan syndication, discounting of bills, property development financing, consultancy and advisory services, portfolio fund management, insurance services ett. Two major OFIs. i e.. NSB and the hPF, are important souiccs of funds foi financing the fiscal deficit The growth in importance of OFIs can be seen in the inciease in their relative share of total assets of the financial system from 26 5 per cent in

1970 to U 9 pei Lent in 1996.

The growth ol OFIs. while bringing many benefits lo the economy, also creates a ntiniKn of challenges to the aiitlunities engaged in foi mutating monetary policy. Monctaiy policy and the tools Used in implementing monetary-policy have, in the past, been focusscd to operate in the framework of traditional commercial banking. However, as the OFIs gmw, mam financial activities take place outside the commercial banks. For instance, a significant amount of ciedit is now extended to enterprises by finance companies and long-term lending institutions such as the DFCC. NDB ..nd the SMIB. private savings and development banks have been established, which take deposits and engage in medium and long-term lending, and even some short tenn trade financing, traditionally done by commercial banks; listed companies have begun to raise funds directly fiom the public through share issues, rathci than obtain ciedit fiom eommeieial banks Consequently, the monctaiy authorities need to focus on these OFIs too when determining monetary policies which aic intended to influence economic activity.

In addition, the cmeigcncc ot these institutions and thcii impact add to the icsponsibilttics of the Central Bank tn its function as the icguiator and supeivisor of the financial system of the country. The icccnt evpeiience in many countries in both Asia and elsewhere clearly demonstrate the importance of the stability of the financial

system. Thus, the major challenge in the years to come pioviding much needed depth and efficiency to the would be to ensure that white these OFls expand. financial maikct. they aie adequately supervised and icgiilated to ensuie the stability of the financial system

was made at Rs.250 per share, while the balance of 0.917 million shares was transferred to an Employees' Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust. This share transaction resulted in increasing NDB's share capital from Rs.175 million to Rs.358 million. Further, the bank raised funds in the international market during the year through a syndicated loan of US dollars 55 million denominated in US dollars and Japanese yen. The enhanced resource base enabled the bank to increase its total assets from Rs.l9,918 million at end 1996 to Rs.26,275 million at end 1997. Total loans approved by the NDB increased to Rs.l 1,647 million for 733 loans at end 1997, an increase of 57 per cent from the previous year's approvals. The increase in total loan approvals was 14 per cent in 1996. As in the previous year, the industrial sector received the largest portion of credit, accounting for 57 per cent of total credit approvals. Loan approvals to the industrial sector increased from Rs. 3,979 million to Rs. 6,679 million in 1997. Loan approvals to the tourism sector increased marginally, while credit approvals to the agriculture sector declined by 23 per .cent and stood at Rs. 815 million at end 1997. The NDB also provided Rs.322 million for five projects during the year. The main sources of funds were foreign borrowings (40 per cent) and repayment of loans by customers (37 per cent). Of the total loans outstanding, 57 per cent were for medium-term financing, 29 per cent were for short-term financing and 14 per cent were for long-term financing. Meanwhile, the majority of loan approvals (74 per cent) were for loans above Rs.25 million.

The State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB), which concentrates mainly on providing financing facilities for housing purposes, approved the vast majority of loans for the housing sector. Total loans approved by the SMIB in 1997 amounted to Rs.l,360 million. All the loans approved by the SMIB were less than Rs.5 million. Of the total approvals, 18 per cent were loans below Rs.100,000, while 82 per cent were in the range of Rs.l00,000 - Rs.5 million. The majority, of loans provided by the SMIB (93 per cent) were of a long-term nature, and were secured by property mortgages and EPF balances.

In line with market trends, the SMIB revised its deposit rates and lending rates several times during the year. At the beginning of the year, the rate on one year fixed deposits was 16.00 per cent per annum. This was gradually reduced to 12.00 per cent by end 1997. Interest rates on lending for housing were also reduced several times during the year. At the beginning of the year, rates on loans up to Rs. 500,000 were in the range of 19.00 - 20.00 per cent per annum. These rates were revised downwards in July and October. By end 1997, the rate charged on loans up to Rs .500,000 was 17.00 per cent per annum and on loans above Rs.500,000 it was 19.00 per cent per annum. Total loans granted by the SMIB. amounted to Rs.l,211 million, while

total deposits raised by the bank amounted to Rs.2,716

million at end 1997, an increase of 39 per cent over the

previous year. The increase in total deposits partly resulted

from the relatively high interest rates offered and the

aggressive advertisement campaigns launched by the SMIB.

Total assets of the SMIB stood at Rs.5,767 million at end

1997, an increase of 11 per cent over the previous year. In

1996, total assets grew by 16 per cent.

Two private licensed specialised banks, engaged in long-

term funding activities, were established during the year.

These were the Pramuka Savings and Development Bank

Ltd. and the Sanasa Development Bank Ltd. The loans

disbursed by these two banks amounted to Rs.599 million,

of which Rs.40 million was long-term financing (over five

years). The major sectors which obtained funds were,

commerce (59 per cent), property development (13 per cent),-

housing (10 per cent) and industry (3 per cent). The majority

of the loans had interest rates in excess of 20 per cent. The

major sources of funds for both banks were fixed deposits

and capital contributions.

The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA)

and Housing Development Finance Corporation of Sri Lanka

Ltd. (HDFC) enhanced their lending activities for housing

purposes. The HDFC approved 3,478 loans to the value of

Rs.484 million in 1997, of which Rs.362 million was

disbursed during the year. This compares with Rs.544 million

approved in 1996 in respect of 4,105 loans. The main

sources of funds of the HDFC were international financial

agencies (ADB and USAID) and the issue of investment

bonds.

The NHDA approved loans to the value of Rs.l,463 million for housing purposes compared with Rs.l ,276 million approved for the same purpose in the previous year. The total number of loans granted was 32,520 and these were . below Rs.25,000 each. All these loans have been granted against personal guarantees and carried an interest rate of 14.00 - 15.00 per cent per annum. The sources of funds of the NHDA were government grants (42 per cent), sale of houses (30 per cent) and recovery of loans (28 per cent).

Finance Companies

Total assets of 25 finance companies operating in the country increased by 24 per cent, compared with a 19 per cent increase in 1996 and reached Rs.22,295 million at end 1997 reflecting a considerable improvement in their activities. In comparison, total assets of commercial banks increased by 14 per cent in 1997 and 16 per cent in 1996.

Total loans and advances including hire purchase and leasing increased by 20 per cent to Rs.14,544 million. The

increase in total advances of commercial banks was 14 per cent in 1997. Investments of finance companies, consisting of investments in government securities, subsidiaries, associated companies and parent companies and other investments increased by 50 per cent to Rs.3,231 million. The bulk of these new investments was in Treasury bills and shares. Investments in Treasury bills, which accounted for 47 per cent of total investments, rose by 36 per cent bringing the investments in Treasury bills to Rs.l ,534 million at end 1997. Meanwhile, other assets of finance companies increased by Rs.783 million (21 per cent) in 1997.

On the liabilities side, deposits with finance companies moved up by Rs.3,835 million (38 per cent) in 1997 compared to Rs.l ,975 million (24 per cent) in 1996 reflecting an improvement in public confidence following the measures taken by the Central Bank to regulate their activities. Consequently, the dependence on borrowings by finance companies declined from Rs.l,454 million to Rs.558 million. Meanwhile, capital, reserves and retained earnings of finance companies increased by Rs.519 million during the year. Other liabilities of finance companies also increased by 23 per cent to Rs.4,576 million in 1997.

Following the declining trend observed in the deposit rates of commercial banks, deposit rates of finance companies have also been gradually reduced, particularly during the second half of the year. Interest rates on fixed deposits maturing in one year, which were in the range of 17.00-21.00 per cent per annum in the first part of year, were reduced to a range of 14.00-21.00 per cent per annum in the latter part of 1997. Interest rates on one year fixed deposits in 1996 were in the range of 18.00-21.00 per cent per annum. Interest rates on fixed deposits maturing in three

months and six months were in the range of 8.00-19.00 per cent per annum and 12.00-20.00 per cent per annum, respectively, during the year. Meanwhile, interest rates on fixed deposits maturing in more than one year were in the range of 15.00-24.00 per cent per annum. Interest rates on one year and two year certificates of deposits were in the range of 13.00-22.00 per cent per annum during the period under review.

Lending rates on hire purchase financing were in the range 11.00-30.00 per cent per annum during the period under review, in comparison to a range of 16.00-30.00 per cent per annum in 1996, while the rate charged by most companies was 25.00 per cent per annum or above, reflecting the risks associated with such lending. Interest rates on leasing were in the range of 13.00-30.00 per cent per annum though the rates charged by most of the companies were less than 20.00 per cent per annum. Loans granted on hire purchase and leasing activities as a percentage of total loans and advances were 18 per cent and 53 per cent, respectively, at end December 1997, in comparison to 20 per cent and 54 per cent, respectively, at end 1996. the lending rates on secured loans and overdrafts of commercial banks were in the range of 11.00-29.00 per cent per annum while on unsecured loans and overdrafts they were in the range of 10-36 per cent during the period under review.

10.10 Specialised Financial Institutions

Merchant Banking

The total number of merchant banks in operation

increased to ten in 1997. Two new merchant banks,

179

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

including one run on Islamic banking principles, opened during the year, while another merchant bank, which had been established previously, commenced operations during the year. Merchant banks engaged in fund based and fee based activities. The performance of the merchant banking sector, as a whole, faced a setback in 1997, primarily due to the very large losses suffered by one merchant bank, which is currently implementing a major restructuring programme. The total income of merchant banks had decreased by 11 per cent in 1997 over the previous year. The major part of this income was derived from fund based activities such as leasing (25 per cent), discounting trade bills (18 per cent), and financial and marketing services (10 per cent). With the opening of the two new merchant banks, the total assets of merchant banks rose from Rs.l3,002 million at the end of 1996 to Rs.18,647 million at end 1997.

Leasing Companies

There were five leasing companies, including three specialised leasing companies and two leasing companies which are subsidiaries of the two state banks, which were engaged primarily in leasing business in 1997. Activities of leasing companies were affected by competition from commercial banks, finance companies and development banks. Total assets of leasing companies increased from Rs.6,084 million in 1996 to Rs.7,028 million in 1997. The total new lease finance provided by these companies increased by 63 per cent and reached Rs.3,217 million. The bulk of lease finance was for commercial vehicles (38 per cent of the total finance), passenger vehicles (32 per cent), and plant and machinery (12 per cent).

In terms of sectors, trade and transport sectors each

accounted for 30 per cent of the total lease financing, while

the industrial sector and the services sector received 17 per

cent and 15 per cent, respectively. Financing for the

construction sector decreased by 31 per cent.

Venture Capital Companies

The total number of venture capital companies (VCCs)

operating in the country increased to seven with the

establishment of a new company in 1997. Total assets of

VCCs grew by 2 per cent to Rs.2,348 million at end 1997.

Total investments of VCCs rose from Rs.l 252 million in

1996 to Rs.l ,588 million in 1997. As in the previous year,

their investment portfolio continued to consist mainly of

equity in new companies for commencement of operations.

Of the total investments, 58 per cent were in equity for

commencement of operations. The expansion of existing

projects absorbed 21 per cent of total investments of VCCs

in 1997, compared to 27 per cent in the previous year. VCCs

invested funds mainly in ventures in the agriculture,

manufacturing and services sectors. Investments in the

manufacturing sector, which accounts for 55 per cent of the

total, increased by 17 per cent to Rs. 799 million. Investment

in the services sector rose by 12 per cent and absorbed 31

per cent of total finance provided. Equity financing for

projects in the agriculture sector rose from Rs.163 million

to Rs. 208 million and accounted for 14 per cent of total

funds provided.

Insurance Companies

There were six insurance institutions operating in the

country. Of the six, five. companies engaged in life and

general insurance activities, while one company conducted

life insurance activities only. Life insurance activities, as well

as general insurance activities, showed an increase during the

year. Legislation is currently being prepared to improve the

regulation of the insurance sector and its activities.

The total life premia collected by the six companies increased to Rs.2,209 million, an increase of 18 per cent over the previous year. This compared with a 22 per cent increase in 1996. The total value, of the life funds of the insurance companies increased from Rs.10,892 million to Rs.13,400 million in 1997. Total benefit payments under life insurance rose by 25 per cent during the year. The total number of life policies in force increased by 17 per cent in 1997.

General insurance, which consists of fire, accident,

marine and motor insurance activities also showed an

increase during the year under review. Net premia for

general insurance rose from Rs.3,398 million to Rs.3,782

million. Net premia in the motor insurance sector, which is

180

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

the biggest non-life sector, rose by 10 per cent or to Rs.l,726

million. Meanwhile, net premia for fire insurance and general

accident insurance rose by 15 per cent and 22 per cent,

respectively. The net premia in marine insurance dropped by

17 per cent to Rs.329 million.

10.11 Money Market

Overall Trends

The Sri Lankan economy recovered strongly in 1997

after the setback in the middle of 1996. With this recovery

and the injection of funds to the market that resulted from

the reduction in the statutory reserve requirement (SRR),

large inflows of foreign funds from privatisation proceeds to

the Government, foreign loans obtained by development

financial institutions, the Government's issue of Floating Rate

Notes and compensation to workers in Kuwait, liquidity

conditions improved and money market rates tended to

stabilise at a lower range while activities of the money

market grew. This trend was clearly reflected in the Treasury

bill market which had a high degree of over-subscription at

most primary Treasury bill auctions. The increased liquidity

due to the above factors, in conjunction with a moderate

demand for credit from both the private sector and the

Government and a decline in inflationary expectations, also

caused a decline in interest rates in the market. The yield

on 12-month Treasury bills fell from 17.38 per cent at end

1996 to 10.21 per cent at end 1997. With a view to absorbing the excess liquidity experienced during the middle of the year, the Central Bank issued its own securities, thereby stabilising short-term interest rates. In the domestic foreign exchange market, the Central Bank's, middle rate for the US dollar depreciated by 7.5 per cent in .1997, while the spot market rates depreciated by 8.0 per cent. Following the downward trends in domestic interest rates, the premium in the forward foreign exchange market declined from about 11.64 per cent per annum for 3 month forward sales at end 1996, to 6.35 per cent per annum at end 1997. The foreign exchange market was active and stable in 1997 though some speculative behaviour was seen towards the latter part of the year as a result of the financial crisis in some East Asian countries.

Inter-Bank Call Money Market

Following the liquidity developments in the money

market, the activities in the inter-bank call money market

expanded substantially while call market rates were generally

stable within a lower range. This was mainly attributed to

improved liquidity resulting from the reduction in the

Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) twice during 1997,

large foreign inflows from the receipts of privatisation

proceeds, and the foreign loans obtained by development

financial institutions. An improved fiscal performance which

reduced government domestic borrowing pressure also

contributed to commercial bank liquidity. Call market rates

which were in the range of 17.50-28.00 per cent per annum

at end December 1996, declined to a narrow and lower range

of 8.00-10.25 per cent at end March 1997. They narrowed

further to a range of 9.50-10.00 per cent at end June and to

8.87-9.00 per cent at end September. Some increase in both

volatility and the level of rates was seen in December, as a

result of uncertainty in the foreign exchange market. Call

market rates fluctuated within a range of 9.00-16.00 per cent

during December 1997 except on three days when the rate

was in the range 18.00-20.00 per cent. Reflecting the active

participation by investors in the call market, the annual

turnover amounted to Rs.l,015,457 million in 1997, an

increase of 7.5 per cent when compared with Rs.944,814

million in 1996.

Treasury Bill Market

Primary Market for Treasury Bills

The major developments in the primary market for

Treasury bills in 1997 was the significant decline in Treasury

bill rates during the year and the retirement of Rs.l0,000

million worth of bills by the Government. The improved

liquidity condition in the market led to the low yield rates

while open market operations of the Central Bank helped to

stabilise interest rates. The increased liquidity in the system

was reflected in the high degree of over-subscription at most

Treasury bill auctions in 1997. The total value of Treasury

bills offered in the primary market during 1997 stood at

Rs.194,866 million as against Rs.219,254 million in 1996.

The Central Bank purchased bills amounting to Rs.9,276

million at the auctions while Treasury bills reserved for the

Central Bank totalled Rs.l6,021 million and were mainly

maturing bills in its portfolio. The Government retired

Treasury bills amounting to Rs.10,000 million on 06 August

with a part of the sales proceeds of Sri Lanka Telecom. In

addition to reducing the Government's interest cost, this also

increased the availability of financial resources to the private

sector. The retirement of Treasury bills was effected by

paying off bills held by the Central Bank, which not only

curtailed the expansion of high powered money, thus

reducing the inflationary pressure in the economy, but also

avoided destabilising the money market. Accordingly, the

total Treasury bills outstanding declined to Rs.l 14,996

million at end of 1997 from Rs.124,996 million at the end

of 1996. The reduction in the portfolio of Treasury bills held

by the Central Bank, however, affected its ability to use

Treasury bills for its open market operations (OMO),

compelling the Bank to issue its own securities for OMO.

The Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills stood at

Rs.6,691 million at end 1997 as against Rs.17,114 million

at end 1996. Treasury bills purchased by commercial banks

in the primary market amounted to Rs.123,313 million in

1997 as against Rs.129,838 million in 1996. Primary market

Treasury bill yields, which were in the range of 17.45-18.17

per cent per annum for 3-month bills in December 1996, fell

significantly to a range of 9.96-9.98 per cent in December

1997, while the yields on 12-month bills decreased from a

range of 17.38-17.93 per cent to a range of 10.17-10.21 per

cent.

Central Bank Secondary Treasury Bill Market

The sales (discounting) of Treasury bills from the

secondary window of the Central Bank rose to Rs.l8,821

million in 1997 from Rs.16,111 million in 1996, while

purchases (rediscounting) of Treasury bills increased to

Rs.17,220 million in 1997 from Rs.16,822 million in 1996.

In the context of declining money market rates, the Central

Bank gradually reduced the discount and re-discount rates

applicable in the secondary window of the Treasury bill

market. Accordingly, discount and re-discount rates for 3-

month bills declined sharply from 17.20 per cent per annum

and 18.95 per cent per annum, respectively, at end 1996 to

9.72 per cent and 12.97 per cent at end 1997. The spread

between the discount rate and the rediscount rate, which was

1.75 percentage points at the beginning of the year, was

varied during the year to influence secondary market activity

and market liquidity, and stood at 3.25 percentage points at

the end of December 1997.

Central Bank Repurchase Market for Treasury Bills

Factors such as primary and secondary, market rates, call

market rates, market liquidity, foreign exchange. market

developments, general economic conditions and policy

considerations were taken into account in setting the repo

rate daily by the Central Bank. Following the declining trend

in the interest rate structure, in the country, the repo rate was

adjusted during 199J. The overnight repo rate, which stood

at 12.75 per cent at end 1996, was reduced to 7.00 per cent

per annum by end March 1997, before being raised to 9.00

per cent by end June. Consequent to the improved liquidity

conditions in the market, the repo rate was reduced again

to 8.25 per cent at end August, and followed by an increase-

to 9.00 per cent at end September. The repo rate was

gradually raised from 9.00 per cent at the beginning of

December to 11.00 per cent by end 1997. The repo rate was

adjusted upward in order to adjust the short-term interest

rates to permit investors to obtain a positive real rate of

return as inflation rose slightly in November and December,

and to discourage domestic speculators from obtaining

relatively low cost rupee funds for the speculative purchase

of US dollars.

Reflecting increased liquidity in the market, high

volumes were transacted in the repo market. This resulted

182

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

in repo sales in 1997 of Rs.446,423 million, when compared

with Rs.403,595 million in 1996. In view of the high

liquidity conditions in the market, the reverse repurchase

scheme of the Central Bank continued to be inactive in 1997.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

During 1997, the Central Bank continued to operate in the domestic foreign exchange market by trading US dollars against Sri Lanka Rupees. The Central Bank announced daily spot buying and selling rates for the US dollar for transactions with commercial banks. The spread between spot buying and selling rates, which was set at 2 per cent in 1995, remained unchanged during 1997. At the end of 1997, the Central Bank middle rate per US dollar was Rs.61.2850 as against Rs.56.7050 at end 1996, a depreciation of 7.5 per cent. Foreign exchange purchases of the Central Bank from commercial banks moved up from US dollars 96.2 million in 1996 to US dollars 136.6 million in 1997, while sales to commercial banks declined from US dollars 198 million to US dollars 154.6 million during the same period. Thus, for the year as a whole, the Central Bank had net sales of US dollars 18 million to commercial banks, in comparison to net sales of US dollars 101.8 million in 1996.

Commercial banks were permitted to grant foreign currency loans to non-BOI exporters, with effect from January 1997, either from their domestic units or from their FCBUs. This provided these exporters with relatively low cost funds, for improving their international competitiveness. Under this scheme, a gross sum of US dollars 254 million had been granted up to end December. At end December, the outstanding level of loans was US dollars 70.7 million.

The financial crisis in East Asia and the sharp depreciation of the exchange rates of these countries had some effect on the Sri Lankan market. Some volatility was seen in the domestic foreign exchange market towards the end of the year with speculation of a large depreciation. This led to the inter-bank spot rate for the US dollar depreciating more than the Central Bank's middle rate and to a purchase of foreign exchange by commercial banks from the Central Bank in December. Commercial banks purchased US dollars 58 million in December from the Central Bank. Market sources indicated that a part of this was to hedge against the forward sales of foreign currency by the banks.

Inter-bank foreign exchange activity also increased, partly due to the uncertainty caused by the East Asian financial crisis. Total inter-bank turnover amounted to US dollars 3,881 million in 1997, in comparison to US dollars 2,367 million in 1996. The uncertainty in the market was clearly reflected in the increase in the volume of forward transactions, which increased to US dollars 3,082 in 1997 from US dollars 1,473 in 1996. The uncertainty was most

marked in November and December. Forward sales averaged US dollars 352 million per month in these two months compared with an average of US dollars 238 per month in the first ten months of 1997. The inter-bank spot rate for US dollars depreciated from Rs.56.6995 at end 1996 to Rs.61.6518 at end 1997, a depreciation of 8.0 per cent.

Central Bank Securities

Consequent on the excess liquidity which resulted from

the receipt of an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan by

a development finance institution and the repayment of some

of the Government's outstanding liabilities to commercial

banks in August, the issue of Central Bank securities

commenced on 1 September 1997, to sterilise the impact of

this excess liquidity. Short-term Central Bank securities, with

maturities of 7 and 28 days were issued, primarily with the

intention of stabilising interest rates in the inter-bank call

market. The issue was open ended with regard to the

quantity. Total issues of 7 day and 28 day securities during

the period 1 September- 29 December were Rs.7,825 million

and Rs.10 million, respectively. The securities were sold at

par, with interest rates based on the overnight repo rate.

Accordingly, the interest rates for 7 days and 28 day issues

were in the range of 8.35-10.91 per cent per annum and 9.21

per cent, respectively.

Commercial Papers (CP)

Commercial paper (CP), which are unsecured

promissory notes issued by companies to raise short-term

funds, have become a significant source of funds to the

private sector and have gained in popularity in the recent

past, due to the downward stickiness of the lending rates

charged by commercial banks for traditional credit. CP are

issued primarily by listed companies and financial institutions

such as merchant banks. They are usually underwritten,

endorsed or guaranteed by a commercial bank or a merchant

bank. The maturity of CP.is usually 3-6 months and they

are almost always issued on a discount basis, rather than

with a coupon.

The gross issues, including reissues, of CP in 1997

amounted to Rs.10,085 million. Merchant banks issued their

own paper amounting to Rs.2,215 million and on behalf of

clients totalling Rs.853 million. Commercial banks supported

CP issues amounting Rs.7,016 million. The bulk of these

issues were 3-month bills. The outstanding value of

commercial papers supported by commercial banks stood at

Rs.1,618 million at end 1997 compared with Rs.l,181

million at end 1996. The yield on commercial paper was in

the range of 10.75 - 24.00 per cent per annum.

10.12 Capital Market

The activities in the Colombo stock market which

remained at a depressed level in 1995 and 1996, showed an

improvement in 1997. A recovery in the economy, improved

foreign investor sentiment, favourable corporate performance,

an increase in domestic demand for shares.with a decline

in interest rates on fixed income securities, the continuation

of the privatisation programme and regional market

developments, contributed largely to increased market activity

and rising share prices, in the first half of 1997. During July

1997, the indices reached their highest levels since August

.1995. However, terrorist activities in Colombo and foreign

investor caution due to the financial crisis in South East

Asian countries led to a slowing down in the stock market

activities during the second half of the year. Net purchases

of foreign investors increased significantly during April to

June, before these investors became net sellers during the

latter part of the year. Two plantation companies and three

non-plantation companies had initial public offerings (IPOs)

during the year. With high tea prices and resultant increased

profits in the plantation companies, the IPOs of the plantation

companies were heavily over-subscribed, whereas those of

non-plantation companies (two hotel sector companies and

a financial sector company) were under-subscribed. Under

the privatisation programme of the Government, a 51 per

cent stake of a plantation company was sold, on an all or

nothing basis, through the Colombo Stock Exchange. In

addition, a part of the Government held debentures in the

NDB were converted into 916,700 shares and offered to the

public through the Colombo'Stock Exchange at Rs.250 per

share (par value Rs.10) in September 1997. The Government

also converted the balance of its holdings of debentures in

the NDB into equity and offered these shares internationally

at the dollar equivalent of Rs.260 per share. The offer was

fully subscribed, demonstrating the confidence reposed in the

Sri Lankan economy by international investors. A net sum

of US dollars 73 million was realised by the Government

through this sale. Meanwhile, the .number of listed

companies at end December 1997 increased to 239 with five

new listings on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).

A major development in the capital market in 1997 was

the issue of Treasury bonds with maturities of 2, 3 and 4

years. These Treasury bonds carry a coupon rate and are sold

by auction. Meanwhile, Vanik Incorporation Limited issued

1.5 million of unsecured 3-year redeemable debentures to the

public in September 1997, which was over-subscribed by 15

per cent. These were sold at a par value of Rs.100 per

debenture while it carried an interest of 18 per cent per

annum payable half yearly. One of the salient features of

these debentures was the tradability in the secondary market

through the Colombo Stock Exchange.

There was a total of five IPOs in 1997 in comparison

to eight in 1996. Of these, three were non-plantation

companies, viz, Marawila Resorts Ltd., Light House Hotel

Ltd. and L.B. Finance Ltd., while two were plantation

companies, viz., Maskeliya Plantations Ltd. and Watawala

Plantations Ltd. The total market value of the five IPOs,

(inclusive of share premium) was Rs.583 million compared

with the market value of Rs.2,178 million of eight IPOs

made in 1996. Meanwhile, the total value of rights issues

was Rs.l,078 million in 1997 compared with Rs.3,064

Secondary Market

The All Share Price Index (ASPI) and Sensitive Price

Index (SPI), which declined in 1995 and 1996, showed

significant increases during the first seven months of 1997,

reaching a peak in July. From July to November both indices

declined continuously, while an upward movement was seen

again in December. The ASPI and SPI improved by 44 per

cent and 57 per cent from end December 1996 to end July

1997, rising from 603 to 870 and 898 to 1,411, respectively.

Eventhough share prices recorded some decline during the

second half of 1997, the year ended with an overall increase

of 16 per cent in the ASPI and 19 per cent in the SPI, which

were attractive increases when compared with the

performance in other markets in the region. . . , .

Market capitalisation of the CSE increased by 47 per

The total turnover showed a substantial increase from Rs.7,403 million in 1996 to Rs.18,315 million in 1997 (an increase of 147 per cent). The average daily turnover increased from Rs.30.6 million in 1996 to Rs.75.9 million in 1997. The number of trades also showed a substantial increase to 206,312 in 1997 from 98,191 in 1996. The largest share (41 per cent) in the total turnover was from the banks, finance and insurance sector, while DFCC Bank, NDB, Sampath Bank and Commercial Bank accounted for 72 per cent of the share of this sector, with a contribution of 48 per cent from two development banks, i.e. DFCC Bank and NDB. Monthly turnover fluctuated, showing significant increases in the months of April, June and July. The highest turnover amounting to Rs.2,243 million was recorded in April, while the lowest (Rs.445 million) was recorded in February. However, turnover fell during the latter part of the year, reflecting the uncertainty that developed in the regional capital markets.

ratio of 15.2 per cent was recorded in July 1997, while at

end December, it had declined to 12.5 per cent.

Improved political stability and recovery in economic

activities had a favourable impact on foreign investor

activities in the Colombo stock market, particularly in the

first seven months of the year. The outcome of foreign

investor activities during this period was a net purchase of

Rs.l,658 million. However, the East Asian crisis had a

dampening effect on foreign transactions in the stock market

in Sri Lanka during the latter part of the year. Net sales of

Rs.910 million were recorded during the period from August

to December. However, overall, foreign transactions

displayed a significant improvement from net purchases of

Rs.352. million in 1996 to Rs.748 million in 1997. During

the period under review, foreign participation accounted for

42.9 per cent of the total turnover compared to 54.7 per cent

in the previous year. The decline of the percentage share of

foreign participation was due to increased domestic activities

Sectoral Performance

The movements in the sectoral price indices showed that

prices in 11 of the total of 16 sectors have moved favourably

in 1997 compared with prices at end 1996. Plantations,

diversified, trading,, beverage, food and tobacco, services,

motors, oil palm, manufacturing, hotels and travel,

construction and banks, finance and insurance were the

sectors in which price improvements were recorded. The

price index of the plantations sector achieved the highest

growth of 61 per cent, boosted by high tea prices, while the

biggest loser was the footwear and textiles sector which

recorded a decline in its prices by 25 per cent. Stores and

supplies, chemical and pharmaceuticals, investment trusts and

land and property were the other sectors in which price

declines were recorded.

Regional Stock Markets

The problems in the financial sector in Thailand,

experienced since mid 1997, had a spillover effect on other

neighbouring countries particularly Malaysia, Indonesia,

Korea, the Philippines, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Together with comparatively strong growth in economies in

North America and Western Europe, this resulted in stock

markets in most countries in the Asia Pacific region being

adversely affected as investors were cautious and reallocated

their portfolios. The worst affected was the Bangkok stock

market which had a 57 per cent decline in the price index

by end December 1997, on a year on year basis. Declines

were recorded in stock markets in Kuala Lumpur (54 per

cent), Jakarta (42 per cent), Seoul (42 per cent), Tokyo (24

per cent), Singapore (30 per cent), Hong Kong (23 per cent)

and Manila (42 per cent). However, Sydney, Taipei,

Bombay, Karachi and Colombo markets recorded gains.

Meanwhile, the share price indicator for the New York stock

exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded a

growth of 23 per cent, while in London, the Financial Times

Stock Exchange Index grew by 25 per cent.

Developments in the Market

The CSE introduced a fully automated screen based

trading system during the second half of the year, eliminating

the old 'open outcry' system of trading that prevailed earlier.

With the introduction of the new system, the CSE became

one of the most technologically advanced stock exchanges

in Asia. Under the new system, the buy or sell order placed

through the broker will be transmitted electronically

immediately to the Stock Exchange. When a matching order

is received the trade would be executed electronically. About

20,000 transactions per trading day could be handled under

this screen based trading system, which, has 100 times the

capacity of the old (manual) trading floor. This has

introduced a new dimension in more competitive trading,

enabling brokers to match orders better and more quickly

which enhances the volume of transactions and gives better

pricing.

With the intention of providing facilities to expand stock

market activities in remote areas, the CSE is planning to set

up branch offices in the provinces. The advanced technology

of the current trading system has made it possible for the

CSE to set up branches with full on line trading capability

at a reasonable cost. Accordingly, stock brokers could be

given a trading desk at the branch office to carry out

transactions on behalf of their clients, eliminating the need

to contact a Colombo broking office. The CSE is also

hoping to introduce stock lending and borrowing to improve

liquidity in the market.

Variik Incorporation Ltd. (Vanik) was granted approval

to start merchant banking and stock broking operations in

Bangladesh, making it the first Sri Lankan institution to start

stock broking operations in a foreign country. For this

purpose Vanik has entered into a joint venture, named Vanik

Bangladesh Ltd.

Several proposals were made in the Budget 1998 with

a view to improving the activity and efficiency of the stock

market. In the previous two Budgets, broker's fees and share

transactions of investment companies and unit trusts had been

exempted from turnover tax, while quoted share transactions

had been exempted from stamp duty. In the 1998 Budget,

the stamp duty on initial public offers was reduced to a

nominal sum of 50 cents for every Rs.l,000. Companies

seeking and obtaining a listing on the CSE were to be given

a tax bonus of 5 percentage points over the prevailing tax

rate. Existing listed companies were also to receive this

concession, provided they maintained 25 per cent of their

issued capital with the public. Capital gains arising from the

sale of equity held in unquoted companies to enable a

company to obtain a listing on the CSE within a prescribed

period was to be exempt from income tax. In order to

encourage individual participation in stock market activity,

investments in new shares of listed companies were to be

allowed as a deduction from assessable income, subject to

certain limits, for a period of one year. The NSB, EPF and

ETF were to be permitted to invest a portion of their funds

in listed companies. The income of Unit Trusts was to be

made tax exempt, though the income distributed by these

would continue to be taxed in the hands of unit holders as

usual. A Settlement Guarantee Fund and a Compensation

Fund were to be established to facilitate market participation;

in trading transactions, with the Government's contribution

to these being limited to,a maximum of Rs.150 million.

Medium and Long-Term Government Securities

Treasury Bonds

A new development in the capital market was the issue

of market oriented government securities. These Treasury

bonds carry a coupon rate, with interest paid semi-annually,

and are also sold by auction. Thus, the yield on these bonds

is market determined. By varying the coupon rate, the

monetary authorities are also able to provide indications to

the market on the expected direction of medium- term

interest rates. The issue of these bonds will provide the

private sector with medium-term benchmark interest rates and

provide a risk free yield curve for a period beyond the one

year provided by Treasury bills. The Government is also thus

able to make its medium-term debt instruments more market

oriented.

The first issue of Treasury bonds, for Rs.500 million,

was made.on 1 March 1997. These bonds carried a coupon

rate of 14.00 per cent per annum and had a maturity of 2

years. The offer was fully subscribed at par. Thereafter,

auctions were held once a fortnight, with Rs.500 million

being offered at each auction. A total of Rs.10 billion worth

of Treasury bonds was issued in 1997. Of this total, Rs.7.5

billion of bonds had a maturity of 2 years, Rs.l billion of

bonds had a maturity of 3 years, and Rs.l.5 billion worth

of bonds were for 4 years. All auctions were over-subscribed

Following market trends and a reduction in inflationary

expectations, the coupon rate was reduced gradually from

14.00 per cent per annum for 2 year bonds at the first

auction, to 11.50 per cent per annum for 2 year bonds at

the last auction on 12 November 1997. The market's

growing acceptance of these Treasury bonds was discernible

in the bidding patterns. The over-subscription, which was

128 per cent at the first auction, was 339 per cent at the

187

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

last auction in November. Market perceptions of inflation and

future interest rates were also displayed at these auctions.

After October, many bids for Treasury bonds were received

at a premium and the weighted average yield fell below the

coupon rate. The weighted average yield on 2 year bonds

declined from 14.00 per cent per annum in February to 11.56

per cent per annum at the last auction in September.

Rupee Loans

The major portion of medium and long-term

Government borrowing continued to be obtained through

Rupee Loans. A total of Rs.48,500 million was raised

through Rupee Loans, in comparison to Rs.46,700 million

in 1996. Rupee Loans are sold at par and carry a fixed rate

of interest. The rate is administratively determined, taking

market trends in interest rates also into consideration.

took place, with several of the new UTs, specialising in

different types of investments, being established. The

expansion in the industry was greatly assisted by an

improved performance in the share market after two years

of price decreases, and to some extent, by a fall in interest

rates in the market. However, the value of their total assets

is still lower than the peak level recorded in 1994.

Five new Unit Trusts, viz. Namal Growth Fund, Namal

Income Fund, Eagle Gilt.Edged Fund, Eagle Income Fund

and Eagle Growth Fund were established. This increased

the total number of UTs operating in the country to 10 at

the end of 1997. Of these, Eagle Incpme Fund and Namal

Income Fund concentrate their investments in fixed income

securities, while Eagle Gilt Edged Fund will be invested

exclusively in Government securities. Namal Growth Fund

and Eagle Growth Fund concentrate their investment

particularly in equities which are expected to show a high

growth in the medium to long-term. The combined'Net Asset

Value (NAV) of UTs rose by 16.5 per cent, compared to a"

drop of 7.6 per cent in 1996. The performance of the UTs

was clearly related to the performance of the Colombo stock

market which recorded an increase of 16.5 per cent in the

All Share Price Index in 1997, compared to a drop of 9 per

cent in 1996.

Unit Trusts

An upsurge of activities in Unit Trusts (UTs) took place

in 1997. Not only did the number of UTs in operation

increase, but a diversification in their investment focus also

The structure of the asset portfolios of UTs has changed

considerably in 1997 compared to that of 1996. Investment

in equities, as a percentage of total net asset value, was 73

per cent in 1997 as against 61 per cent in 1996. The number

188

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

of unit holders also increased by 5 per cent in 1997

compared to a marginal drop in 1996. Proposals in the 1998

Budget are also designed to encourage UTs. The tax

exemption enjoyed by Unit Trusts was due to expire by 31

March 1998. The Budget proposed that the income of UTs

would not be taxed in the hands of the Unit Trusts. Income

distribution by UTs to unit holders would be taxed in the

hands of unit holders as normal income.
