This was continued in 1997. The consolidated monetary survey indicated a 13.2 per cent point to point growth in broad money at end 1997, in comparison to a growth of 11.3 per cent at end 1996. An analysis of the causal factors of this growth indicted that 58 per cent of the growth was due to the growth in NFA and 42 per cent due to growth in net domestic assets, whereas in 1996, the change in NFA contributed to a 5 per cent decline in money supply. As in the case of the conventional monetary survey including the domestic units alone, net credit to the government from the banking system showed a contraction (of Rs.l,881 million). However, in contrast to the results in the domestic unit monetary survey, credit to the private sector has grown by 14.3 per cent in 1997. in comparison to 8.9 per cent in 1996. Total credit extended to the private sector amounted to Rs.32,878 million in 1997, as against Rs.30,789 million in 1996, indicating an increase in the credit from FCBUs. This credit from FCBUs is obtained mainly by BOI firms. With approximately 16 per cent of",

The maturity of the Treasury bonds issued ranged from 2 to 4 years. The weighted average yield rate on this new instrument, which started at 14 per cent per annum for 2-year bonds in March, fell to 11.56 per cent by September. The yield on the last issue, a 4-year bond issued in October was 11.36 per cent per annum. These yields are market determined and provided some indication of the movement in long-term rates. The availability of these Treasury bond yields further helps to build up a longer-term yield curve in the financial market, and provides risk free benchmark rates for the private sector.",

The reduction in the SRR increased the loanable funds in commercial banks while enabling them to reduce their lending rates. At the same time, the availability of liquid funds in the market and the decline in yield rates on government, debt instruments led to a reduction in their deposit rates. Commercial banks preferred to invest in low risk government securities rather than lend aggressively to the private sector. Commercial bank holdings of Treasury bills and government securities showed an increase of 41 per cent in 1997 when compared to the increase of 33 per cent in 1996, in spite of the decline in yields. Private sector investors were also cautious about making large scale investments. Credit from the FCBUs to the private sector has expanded. Non-BOI exporters benefited from the new foreign currency loan facility which came into effect from January 1997. Gross lending under this facility amounted to approximately US dollars 254 million.

However, in line with the Government's policy to convert gradually such state funded credit schemes to. self-funding schemes, Phase II was designed to be funded by the 3 PCIs out of their own resources. Taking into account the concessionary interest rate of 10 per cent per annum and the high transactions costs and credit risks involved in micro loans, the Government agreed to support PCIs with an interest subsidy of 10 per cent per annum on every performing loan. At end 1997, 4,542 loans to a value of Rs.171 million, had been.granted by PCIs under Phase II of the Surathura Scheme.",

    "text": "The history of OFIs dates back lo the late lvih Century with the setting up of savings institutions, such a\"; the Ceylon Savings Bank (1832), the Post Office Savings Bank (IS85) and small Thrift and Ciedit Co\u00adoperative Societies (1906) in the early 20th Century Although those OFIs weie initially meant to enhance savings and inculcate thrift habits through the acceptance of interest bearing term deposits from the public for lending, with the sophistication in financial facilities and services, their horizons weie broadened. Typically, OFIs flourish in open economies Thus, with the increasing control of the economy by the State in the 1960s and 1970s, their activities declined. Ho*cvcr. the Government itself and some public sector institutions did set up some public sector OFIs, such a* Co-opcrauve Rural Banks, the National Savings Bank and the Insurance Corporation of Sii Linka, during this period. Following the economic policy reforms in 1977. die private sector took the initiative in establishing different types of OFIs to cater to varying needs of society. The expansion in finance companies and the emergence of meicltant banks, ventuic Ldprtal companies, iwsmg companies and money brokcts have been the result of this trend. This ted to a more dynamic financial system and improved the quality and the efficiency of the financial intermediation process.",

Further, the bank raised funds in the international market during the year through a syndicated loan of US dollars 55 million denominated in US dollars and Japanese yen. The enhanced resource base enabled the bank to increase its total assets from Rs.l9,918 million at end 1996 to Rs.26,275 million at end 1997. Total loans approved by the NDB increased to Rs.l 1,647 million for 733 loans at end 1997, an increase of 57 per cent from the previous year's approvals. The increase in total loan approvals was 14 per cent in 1996. As in the previous year, the industrial sector received the largest portion of credit, accounting for 57 per cent of total credit approvals. Loan approvals to the industrial sector increased from Rs. 3,979 million to Rs. 6,679 million in 1997. Loan approvals to the tourism sector increased marginally, while credit approvals to the agriculture sector declined by 23 per .cent and stood at Rs. 815 million at end 1997. The NDB also provided Rs.322 million for five projects during the year. The main sources of funds were foreign borrowings (40 per cent) and repayment of loans by customers (37 per cent). Of the total loans outstanding, 57 per cent were for medium-term financing, 29 per cent were for short-term financing and 14 per cent were for long-term financing.

With a view to absorbing the excess liquidity experienced during the middle of the year, the Central Bank issued its own securities, thereby stabilising short-term interest rates. In the domestic foreign exchange market, the Central Bank's, middle rate for the US dollar depreciated by 7.5 per cent in .1997, while the spot market rates depreciated by 8.0 per cent. Following the downward trends in domestic interest rates, the premium in the forward foreign exchange market declined from about 11.64 per cent per annum for 3 month forward sales at end 1996, to 6.35 per cent per annum at end 1997. The foreign exchange market was active and stable in 1997 though some speculative behaviour was seen towards the latter part of the year as a result of the financial crisis in some East Asian countries.",

The largest share (41 per cent) in the total turnover was from the banks, finance and insurance sector, while DFCC Bank, NDB, Sampath Bank and Commercial Bank accounted for 72 per cent of the share of this sector, with a contribution of 48 per cent from two development banks, i.e. DFCC Bank and NDB. Monthly turnover fluctuated, showing significant increases in the months of April, June and July. The highest turnover amounting to Rs.2,243 million was recorded in April, while the lowest (Rs.445 million) was recorded in February.
