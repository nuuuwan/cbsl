3. AGRICULTURE, FISHING AND FORESTRY

3.1 Production Trends

The agricultural sector grew by 3 per cent in 1997. This

mainly reflected a recovery from the depressed conditions in

1996 and the improved performance of the buoyant tea

sector which was attributed to improved management under

the private sector as well as attractive tea prices. Tea

production increased by 7 per cent in 1997 following the

peak output level in 1996. Coconut output showed a

moderate growth rate of 3 per cent. Rubber production,

however, declined by 6 per cent, mainly due to labour

shortages and heavy rains in the last quarter. Rubber prices

also declined sharply in 1997. In the domestic agricultural

sector, paddy recovered by 9 per cent with an improvement

in the yield. The other agricultural crops showed'a mixed

performance. Production of pepper, cloves, cinnamon quills

and'citronella is estimated to have increased in 1997. Among

subsidiary food crops, big onions, sesame, ground huts and

red onions showed higher output levels while chillie and

potato output declined as these crops became relatively less

attractive to high cost producers after the removal of

licensing on imports in 1996. Agricultural activities in the

Northern Province returned to near normalcy. With the

opening up of certain fishing areas in the North and East

and higher inland fish output, the total fish production is

estimated to have increased by 5 per cent in 1997.

32 Agricultural Policy

The present agricultural strategy is to increase

agricultural productivity, improve farm incomes and ensure

a continued supply of food at a reasonable price to

consumers in a competitive environment. The private sector

is expected to play the leading role in production, marketing

and provision of inputs such as planting material, while the

state sector is expected to play a supportive role to facilitate

the achievement of policy objectives.

In the plantation sector, the privatisation of the state-

owned Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) which

commenced in 1995 continued in 1997 as well. During the

year, 51 per cent of the shares of 7 companies were sold to

the highest bidder on an 'all or nothing basis' through the

Stock Exchange, bringing the total number of privatised

RPCs to 20 and reducing the state owned RPCs to 3. Due

to the buoyant tea prices which prevailed during the year,

the shares of all these issues fetched premium prices above

the fixed minimum of Rs.10 per share. Malwatta Valley

Plantations, which was bought by Wayamba Plantations,

fetched the highest price of Rs.61 per share. The other

plantations of which 51 per cent of the shares were sold

during the year were Maturata (at Rs.45.75 per share),

Elpitiya (at Rs.30.25 per share), Talawakelle (at Rs.40.00 per

share) and Pussellawa (at Rs.39.00 per share). Further, 20

per cent of the shares of Maskeliya and Watawala

Plantations were sold to the public through the Stock

Exchange at Rs.15 per share, while 19 per cent of the

balance shares of 5 companies, namely, Bogawantalawa,

Kegalle, Agalawatte, Horana and Kelani Valley, were sold

at prices ranging from Rs.31.11 per share to Rs.37.05 per

share. At end 1997, 90 per cent of the shares in 5 RPCs,

71 per cent of the shares in 3 RPCs and 51 per cent of the

shares in 12 RPCs had been sold to the private sector.

Paddy production, which suffered a severe setback during 1996, recovered only partially during 1997, resulting in a shortfall in production for the second consecutive year. Due to the shortfall in production, rice prices showed an upward movement in 1997. Pressure on rice prices was further aggravated towards the end of 1997 due to supply bottlenecks caused by heavy rains. Consequently, as in 1996, the Government intervened in the market and waived the 35 per cent duty on imported rice from 20 November 1997 until the end of January 1998 just prior to the commencement of the 1997/98 Maha harvest. The import tariff on potatoes, chillies and onions, which was reduced to 20 per cent from 35 per cent in December 1996, continued at that level until 31 January 1997, which resulted in a heavy influx of imports of these commodities.

Increase in chillie imports coupled with an increased

Maha harvest led to an excess supply situation, reducing the

domestic prices to unremunerative levels. Realising the need

to protect the rural farmers, the Government implemented a

minimum producer price scheme for some crops, including

chillies, in August 1997. The Co-operative Wholesale

Establishment (CWE) intervened in the market whenever the

market prices dipped below the minimum price. In

31

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

November 1997, the Government announced that this scheme

would be extended for a period of two years.

Sudden ad hoc tariff changes are not advisable for long-

term growth of the agricultural sector. It creates uncertainty

in the market as government policy becomes unpredictable

and scares away producers, importers and traders. A firm

commitment to transparent and consistent trade policy will

help the development' of the agricultural sector as well as

trading arrangements. An improvement in agricultural

productivity requires agriculture to be remunerative. It is

necessary for agricultural producers to be aware of the

returns to their investment prior to cultivation or

commencement of production activities. Therefore, policy

measures such as ad hoc duty waivers are not in the best

interests of the sector. The involvement of the CWE in the

procurement, trade and sale of agricultural commodities

should be gradually phased out, allowing the private sector

to play an effective role in the development of the sector.

The fertiliser subsidy scheme which was in force for the

four major varieties of fertiliser, viz. urea, sulphate of

ammonia, muriate of potash and triple super phosphate,

continued until September 1997. The subsidy was revised

during October 1997 and under the new scheme, the subsidy

was confined to urea only. The objective of this revision was

to target the subsidy to the more needy small farmers. Under

this scheme, the retail price of a 50 kg. bag of urea was

fixed at Rs.350. The scheme is subject to revision on a

seasonal basis.

In order to protect the local sugar industry, a normal

tariff rate of 35 per cent is imposed on imported sugar.

However, to reduce the local price in the wake of increasing

international prices, a 17 percentage point duty waiver was

imposed on sugar imports during 1996. With a drop in the

international price of sugar, the duty waiver was reduced to

10 percentage points from 11 August 1997. The present

duty is 25 per cent.

Recognising the importance of the dairy industry, the

Government sought the assistance of the National Dairy

Development Board (NDDB) of India to set up a joint

venture. The Indian Government responded positively and the

'Kiriya Milk Industries Company', a joint venture was

floated between the NDDB of India and the Milk Industries

of Lanka Company Ltd. (MILCO). The Indian Government

has also offered a line of credit to supply the required

machinery and equipment. Further, the Government of India

has agreed to use the dividend income from this project to

build a separate fund for the development of the dairy

industry..

3 3 Export Crops

Tea

Tea production has recorded an upward trend during the

last few years. This continued in 1997 as well and

production reached a new peak level of 277 million kg. This

was an improvement of 7 per cent over the previous year's

peak production. Enhanced production in the high elevational

areas by 16 per cent and mid elevational areas by 19 per

cent, attributed to improved management in estates under the

privatised plantation companies, coupled with well distributed

rainfall experienced during the year, was primarily

responsible for the increased tea output. Production in the

high and medium elevations, which suffered a setback with

the nationalisation of the plantation sector during the 1970s

appears to be bouncing back to higher levels of efficiency

with the privatisation of the former state owned Janatha

Estate Development Board (JEDB) and Sri Lanka State

Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) controlled estates. The high

and mid elevations registered the highest production level

after 1971 and 1981, respectively. In addition, as a result of

the attractive prices which prevailed throughout the year,

plucking had commenced even on the abandoned and

neglected marginal tea smallholdings, especially in the mid

elevational areas. The recommencement of agricultural

activities in the neglected tea lands contributed immensely

towards the substantial increase in production. However, after

four consecutive years of increased production, the output in

the low elevational areas dropped by 2 per cent due to a

dry spell.

Tea production of the smallholder sector continued to

increase and recorded a 1 per cent improvement over the

previous year. However, the share of the smallholder

contribution towards the overall output declined from 57 per

cent in the previous year to 54 per cent in 1997. The average,

yield of the smallholder sector, which recorded a 5 per cent

improvement in 1996, showed a further 2 per cent

improvement to 1,972 kg. per hectare in 1997. Meanwhile,

the average yields of the estate sector too have shown a

significant improvement. This has contributed to a 7 per cent

improvement in the national yield to 1,465 kg. per hectare.

However, the average yields of the estate sector are far from

satisfactory when compared with the smallholders. The yields

recorded by the smallholders are more than one and half

times that of the estate yields. The main reason for the poor

yields of the estate sector could be attributed to the large

extents of tea which are still under poor yielding seedling

tea compared to the high yielding vegetatively propagated

(VP) tea. Hence, the plantation companies will have to

embark on a vigorous replanting and infilling programme

with VP tea plants to be competitive and viable even if the

international prices take a downturn.

The production of cut, tear and curl (CTC) tea which

suffered a temporary set back in 1996, recovered during the

year and recorded a 15 per cent growth to 19 million kg.

The weighted average cost of production of made tea of the state owned plantations and 21 plantation companies increased by 4 per cent to Rs.90.26 per kg. As in the previous year, the cost of labour (up keep and cultivation) accounted for the biggest share of about 40 per cent in the cost of production (COP). Payment for bought leaf is calculated based' on the monthly sales average. Thus the increased payment to green leaf too raised the COP.

The upward movement in the tea prices, which

commenced during the latter part of 1995, continued

throughout 1997 as well. The buoyant tea prices were

attributed to the supply shortfall in the main competing

countries, viz., India and Kenya. Exportable surpluses of

Indian tea continued to be limited due to increasing domestic

demand. Meanwhile, tea production in Kenya suffered a

setback due to a severe drought experienced during the year.

As a result, Sri Lanka regained her position as the world's

premier exporter of tea relegating Kenya to second place.

The annual net sales average price realised at the Colombo

Auction, which grew by a phenomenal 44 per cent in the

previous year, recorded a further significant improvement to

Rs.l 19.40 per kg. to register the best price realised at the

Colombo Auction in rupee terms, surpassing the previous

year's peak price by a further 15 per cent. The annual

average export price, which improved by 36 per cent in the

previous year, recorded a further 13 per cent improvement

to Rs.158.39 per kg.

Year

The volume of exports during the year has increased by

10 per cent to 268 million kg. The increased volume of

exports, together with enhanced prices, realised a 25 per cent

improvement in the export earnings to reach about Rs.42,500

million. As a result, export earnings from tea accounted for

16 per cent of total export earnings in 1997. As in the

previous year, countries of the Commonwealth of

Independent States (CIS) continued to be the leading buyers

of Sri Lankan tea and accounted for 20 per cent of the

exports. Turkey was the second largest importer of Sri

Lankan tea. The Sri Lanka Tea Board opened a Promotional

Tea Bureau in Istanbul in September 1997.

The exports of tea in bags recorded an improvement and accounted for 4 per cent of total exports. However, black tea in bulk form was the largest category, accounting for over 55 per cent of total exports. The average price of value added tea in bags is nearly two and half times the average price fetched for bulk tea. Hence, Sri Lanka has a vast potential to improve export earnings through value addition. This will not only increase employment opportunities but also will minimise the risk of losses incurred due to fluctuations in international tea prices.

Fertiliser application in the tea sector, which increased,

with the improvement in prices, continued to grow by a

further 4 per cent during 1997. The distribution of fertiliser

through the fertiliser loan scheme implemented by the Tea

Small Holding Development Authority (TSHDA) increased

by 60 per cent compared to the previous year. For the third

consecutive year, the assistance for new planting remained

33

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

at the same level of Rs .36,000 per hectare which is adequate

to cover only a fraction (about 11 per cent) of the actual

cost of new planting. The extent newly planted during the

year declined from 479 hectares in 1996 to 340 hectares. The

amount disbursed by the TSHDA for smallholders amounted

to Rs. 8 million compared to Rs.16 million disbursed in

1996. Assistance for replanting too remained at the same

level as in the previous year at Rs.67,000 for mid and high

elevations, while the rate for low elevation was Rs.57,000

per hectare. The extent replanted by the smallholders too

diminished to 435 hectares and the amount disbursed was

Rs.30 million. Replanting activity would have been affected

because of the prevailing high prices as the loss of income

due to uprooting at a time of high prices will be substantial.

In addition to the assistance given to the tea smallholders

for replanting and new planting, the TSHDA also carried out

the Small Holder Tea Development Project under which a

sum of nearly Rs.300 million was given as loans for

replanting, new planting and nursery development. During

the year, the TSHDA also implemented a special savings

investment insurance scheme referred to as 'Tea Shakthi' for

smallholders. The number of members enrolled at end 1997

amounted to 55,648.

Tea is gaining popularity as a health drink in the developed countries, especially in the Western hemisphere. However, the industry should not be too optimistic about the prevailing buoyant prices because the recovery of Kenyan output could depress international prices. Therefore, to be viable, and competitive in the international market, improving productivity is essential. In this respect, high priority should be given to a systematic replanting programme.

Under the Factory Development Assistance Scheme, a total of Rs.44 million was disbursed among 93 factories during the year. In view of the increased prices received, the cess was increased by 50 cts. to Rs.2.50 per kg. from 2 April 1997. The total amount of cess collected during the year was Rs.538 million, which was 9 per cent higher than the previous year's collection.

Rubber

Rubber production during 1997, estimated at 106 million kg., was 6 per cent lower than the production recorded in 1996. The decline in production was due to lower fertiliser application and heavy rains in the last quarter. The prices also declined sharply in 1997. In addition, an increased number of rainy days towards the latter part of the year restrained rubber tapping to some extent. .

Sri Lanka is neither a major producer nor a major

exporter of natural rubber. However, it is a major supplier

of latex crepe rubber to the world market, which is sold at

a premium. According to 1996 world natural rubber

production and export statistics, Sri Lanka is ranked at

seventh and fifth positions-, respectively. Its production and

export shares are less than 2 per cent of the global

production and exports. Several factors accounted for the

decline in natural rubber prices in the international market.

The accumulation of large natural rubber stockpiles in

Thailand and China had weakened the strategic importance

it had and hence compelled the USA to release its natural

rubber stocks in February and May 1997. The International

Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO) which represents both

natural rubber producers and consumers, intervenes in the

market to stabilise rubber prices. However, such intervention

did not take place as the Daily Market Indicator Price

(DMIP) which is measured in terms of Malaysian/Singapore

cents had not come down below the threshold level.

Although, the price of natural rubber in terms of local

currencies went up especially in Thailand and in Indonesia,

in terms of the US dollar the prices declined sharply. This

encouraged certain domestic manufacturers to import large

quantities of natural rubber, particularly latex, from these

countries. As a result, domestic market prices fluctuated with

international prices. The declining price trend observed in the

international markets in 1997 was also reflected in the

domestic market. When compared with 1996 prices, the

About 66 per cent of coconut production is locally

consumed. The DC mills, oil mills and other kernel

processing industries as well as copra exporters compete for

the balance. Since output improved, copra imports dropped

by 51 per cent to 395,600 kg. With the decline in palm oil

prices in the international market and the granting of import

tariff and turnover tax concessions, an unprecedented volume

of palm oil, amounting to 37.7 million kg., was imported

during the year as against 21.9 million kg. imported in 1996.

However, palm kernel oil imports declined from 17 million

kg. in 1996 to 9 million kg. in 1997. Edible oils, other than

coconut oil, enjoyed an import duty waiver of 30 per cent

until 15 January 1997 when it was reduced to 20 per cent.

The general tariff rate was 35 per cent. Turnover tax on

edible oils was at 7 per cent (increased to 8 per cent in

November 1997) while for a majority of coconut products,

turnover tax was 20 per cent (reduced to 18 per cent in

November 1997). The availability of cheaper imported

vegetable oils has resulted in a decline in the quality of the

coconut oil sold in the local market since it is adulterated

with these vegetable oils.

Based on the last islandwide Census of Agriculture in

1982, the extent under coconut is estimated at around

417,000 hectares. However, according to the Coconut

Cultivation Board (CCB) the extent in bearing was around

363,000 hectares in 1997, the same as in 1996. Taking the

extent in bearing into consideration the average yield

improved marginally and is estimated at 7,198 nuts per

hectare in 1997. The optimum yield is around 15,000 nuts

per hectare. About 75 per cent of the extent under coconut

is in the hands of smallholders with holdings of less than 8

hectares. Hence, low yields are mainly the result of poor

cultivation practices by smallholders due to neglect of field

maintenance. The CCB is taking steps to increase the

productivity of coconut lands through their extension services

by a more systematic and scientific approach in the

application of various inputs, and the disbursement of

development assistance.

During the year, cess development assistance rates provided through the CCB for replanting (which includes moisture conservation and intercropping) was Rs.38,750 per hectare, while for new planting it was Rs.40,000 per hectare. Cess assistance services of the CCB are targeted at private sector smallholders and are not provided to public sector estates or plantations over 4 hectares in extent. Through CCB assistance, the extent replanted during the year was 1221 hectares, a more than twofold increase over 1996. The extent newly planted increased by 11 per cent to 931 hectares. In addition, the CCB provided coconut plants free of charge to home gardens (not exceeding 10 plants per cultivator) where the land had been prepared as stipulated by the CCB. The CCB aims to encourage home garden production for domestic use in order to release estate output for export oriented coconut kernel processing industries. The plants issued to home gardens increased marginally to 1.1 million plants. Favourable weather conditions enabled an improvement in these field activities in 1997. However, fertiliser issued to the coconut sector decreased by 11 per . cent to 34,700 metric tons. This is attributed to the reduction in the use of sulphate of ammonia (SA) fertiliser by about 40 per cent compared to 1996 on account of the removal of the subsidy on SA in September 1997.

The fragmentation of coconut land as a result of the increase in demand for industries, housing and development projects continued in 1997. The pressure for land is highest

36

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

in the low country wet zone areas where most of the coconut

as well as rubber lands exist (mainly in the Gampaha and

Kalutara Districts). The suitability of these lands for

purposes such as housing, together with the high

remuneration received on real estate, has led to a reduction

in the extent of highly productive coconut lands, thereby

reducing the average yields in the coconut sector. At present,

the Western Provincial Council (covering the Districts of

Kalutara, Colombo and Gampaha) controls the fragmentation

of high yielding coconut land through administrative

measures. The CCB has estimated that around 1.000 hectares

of coconut lands per year is lost to the coconut sector.

Assuming that only marginal lands are fragmented, the CCB

estimates that the loss in production per year is around 6

million nuts. To overcome the loss in production, the CCB

is popularising the cultivation of coconut in other areas such

as the Mahaweli Project areas.

According to the Coconut Development Authority (CDA) estimates, the cost of production (COP) had increased by 4 per cent to Rs.2.26 per nut in 1997: However, in large plantations, the COP had gone up to around Rs.3.50 per nut. Fresh nut retail prices were at record levels at an average of Rs.l3.15 per nut in the first four months of the year, compared to Rs.9.30 per nut in the previous year. This was mainly due to the spillover of the shortfall in supply experienced in 1996. Prices declined in mid 1997 with the improvement in supply and rose again in the last quarter of the year with the onset of the lean period. The average retail price in 1997 was Rs.l 1.85 per nut, an increase of 26 per cent. Coconut oil prices in the local market showed a declining trend from the record levels registered at the beginning of the year. Improved nut supply and enhanced imports of vegetable oil substitutes resulted in lower prices. International prices of coconut oil too declined shaiply in 1997 due to the improvement in coconut oil supplies from the leading exporter, the Philippines, as well as the increase in world supply of substitute vegetable oils. In January 1997, the average international price of coconut oil was US dollars 784 (c.i.f Rotterdam) per metric ton, while in the sanie month in 1996 it was US dollars 709 per metric ton. By December, the price declined to US dollars 584 (c.i.f Rotterdam) per metric ton. The currency crisis in East Asian countries also contributed to the drop in coconut oil prices. International prices of copra followed a similar pattern as for coconut oil.

The average export price (f.o.b) of the three major

coconut kernel products increased marginally to Rs.9.63 per

nut in 1997. Average export (f.o.b) price of DC was US

dollars 1,085 per metric ton, while those of coconut oil and

copra were US dollars 841 per metric ton and US dollars

824 per metric ton, respectively. The quality of Sri Lanka

DC is one of the world's best and as an exporter, Sri Lanka

is second only to the Philippines. The export of the three

major kernel products increased by 6 per cent to 505 million

nuts. The export earnings of all coconut products increased

by 14 per cent. A substantial increase of 28 per cent in

export earnings was recorded from non kernel export

products. Sri Lanka is a major supplier of coconut shell

activated carbon and coir/fibre products in the international

market.

300

The same cess rates as in 1996 were applied to different

categories of coconut products exported in 1997. The highest

cess rate was applied to DC, which was Rs.l,000 per metric

ton of DC exported. Total cess collection during 1997

increased by 9 per cent to Rs.l 10 million. The cess collected

is re-invested in the coconut sector through cess assistance

schemes. In 1997, Rs.12.9 million was granted for replanting,

Rs.12.2 million for new planting and Rs.22.6 million for

planting coconut seedlings in home gardens.

The DC Mill Development Programme to encourage the installation of new technology to improve the quality of DC was carried out in 1997 and a sum of Rs.5 million was granted to 17 mills as reimbursement for expenditure incurred. This programme is funded partly from the cess collected that is allocated to individual Mill Development Fund accounts of DC factories. Grant assistance not exceeding Rs.3 million per mill for DC mill modernisation to install a modern continuous process drying system and steam system was also provided. Accordingly, 20 DC mills at various stages of modernisation received a total sum of Rs.17.68 million in 1997. Grant assistance was also provided from cess funds for the Fibre Mill Modernisation scheme. A mill is granted a sum not exceeding Rs.250,000 for the installation of a defibering machine and a sum not exceeding Rs.225,000 for the installation of a husk crushing machine. In addition, a grant is provided to cover 50 per cent of the cost of obtaining the main supply of electricity, subject to a

37

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

maximum payment of Rs.250,000, while a maximum payment of Rs.75,000 per mill is available for internal electrification. The maximum grant assistance to a mill for installing a husk crushing machine and electrification is Rs.300,000: In 1997, grant assistance amounting to Rs.2.6 million under the Fibre Mill Modernisation Scheme was obtained by 21 fibre mills.

The Coconut Research Institute (CRI) carried out various research activities into improving yields, the application of different types of organic manure, methods of integrated control of major pests and diseases and the development of coconut based products (such as improving the shelf life of king coconuts for the export market). Farm rehabilitation and extension services to improve the knowledge and skills of coconut growers were also carried out by the CRI.

Other Export Crops

Other export crops consist of a wide variety of crops, which includes beverage crops such as coffee and cocoa, spices such as cloves, cardamom, pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg and essential oils such as citronella and cinnamon leaf oil. These crops are grown as mixed crops in home gardens, except cinnamon, which is cultivated in a more organised manner on large scale estates in the Southern Province.

According to the estimates of the Department of Export Agriculture, the production of cloves, pepper, citronella and cocoa during 1997 has improved over the previous year's production levels. The production of nutmeg, cinnamon leaf oil and coffee declined. Clove production, which has shown a declining trend over the years due to unremunerative prices, reported a significant improvement in 1997. Clove production is estimated to have increased by 62 per cent over the previous year, mainly due to favourable weather conditions that prevailed during the flowering season. However, most of the farmers do not pick the entire harvest due to the high cost of harvesting. India still continues to impose non-tariff barriers to restrict the entry of cloves. The removal of non-tariff barriers to improve the export of cloves to India should be a priority at the negotiations of the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA).

Pepper production is estimated to have increased by 12 per cent and this improvement in.output is attributed to an increase in the extent in bearing as well as an improvement in management due to the attractive prices that prevailed during 1996 and 1997. For the fourth successive year, the global consumption has outstripped production resulting in the stocks dwindling to' very low levels. As a result, the international prices of pepper had increased by 73 per cent to Rs.223 per kg. during 1997. Consequently, the average farmgate price and the auction prices have shown a more

than twofold increase to Rs.198.24 per kg. and Rs.224.89 per

kg., respectively. The international price of white pepper is about one and a half times that of black pepper. Hence, the conversion of black to white pepper would be a means of being competitive in the export market.

All the other crops in this category recorded improved

farmgate prices during the year, except coffee and cinnamon

leaf oil which declined by 9 per cent and 8 per cent,

respectively, to Rs.56 per kg. and Rs.366 per kg. The other

notable improvement in farmgate prices was recorded by

mace (78 per cent), nutmeg with shell (22 per cent) and

cinnamon quills (43 per cent).

Extents newly planted with coffee, pepper, cocoa,

cinnamon and cardamom increased by nearly 700 hectares

during 1997 and thereby increased the cumulative extent

under these crops by 1 per cent to 68,122 hectares. As in

the previous year, the largest extent newly planted was under

pepper and accounted for 77 per cent of the newly planted

extent during the year.

The development assistance under the Export

Agricultural Crop Assistance Scheme during 1997 increased

by 21 per cent to Rs.27 million. As in the two previous

years, pepper and cinnamon together accounted for the major

share, amounting to 65 per cent of the total disbursements.

The total export volume of these crops showed a 2 per

cent increase over the exports of the previous year. However,

the total export value showed a substantial increase of over

47 per cent to Rs.4,262 million, mainly on account of the

attractive international prices that prevailed during the year

for most of these commodities. Cinnamon accounted for over

two thirds of the export earnings of these crops. Export

earnings from these crops have increased over the. years and

at present have almost reached (about 92 per cent) the

earnings from rubber exports.

38

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

of crop failure and an improvement in the yield contributed

to the increased production.

Paddy output in Maha 1996/97 increased by 9 per cent

to an estimated 1.46 million metric tons (70 million bushels)

due to higher yield and an improvement in the extent

harvested, Production in a majority of the districts were

better than in the previous Maha season. All the districts in

the Northern Province showed improved performances

indicating that the security situation has improved after the

recapture of these areas by the Government security forces

and that agricultural activities appear to have returned to, near

normal levels.

The most notable improvement was from the

Kurunegala District which recorded an improvement of over

90 per cent to reach 193,000 metric tons compared to

102,000 metric tons harvested in the previous Maha season.

The highest production level of 215,000 metric tons was

recorded from the Ampara district and accounted for 15 per

cent of the total Maha output. Ampara, Kurunegala,

Polonnaruwa and Mahaweli 'H' area together accounted for

almost half (49 per cent) of the Maha production.

Paddy output in the Yala season, which recorded a 30

per cent drop in 1996, improved partially during Yala 1997

and recorded a 7 per cent increase to 782,000 metric tons

(37 million bushels). Both an improvement in the yield and

an increase in the extent harvested contributed towards the

improvement in output. All districts except eight recorded

Sri Lanka's share of world trade in spices except

cinnamon is less than 2 per cent. Hence, there is a potential

to increase the output of these spices without affecting the

prices. Production of most of the spices could be increased

by inter-cropping the coconut lands. Presently, only about 5

per cent of the coconut lands are inter-cropped with these

crops.

The Perennial Crops Development Project (PCDP)

which commenced operations in 1990 with Asian

Development Bank (ADB) funding completed its operations

in December 1997 as scheduled originally. The cumulative

loan approvals and disbursements as at end of 1997

amounted to Rs.824 million and Rs.642 million, respectively.

.In view of the satisfactory progress achieved by the Project, the ADB has agreed to finance the second Perennial Crops Development Project with a loan facility of SDR 14.7 million. The loan was successfully negotiated between the Government and the ADB in September 1997.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka

39

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

improved output levels during Yala 1997. The most notable

drop in production was recorded in the Ampara District

which showed a 25 per cent reduction in output to 162.000

metric tons. In spite of this drop in production, the Ampara

District recorded the highest Yala output for the fourth

consecutive year and accounted for 21 per cent of the total

Yala production. Ampara. Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala

Districts together accounted for 50 per cent of the Yala

production.

The annual average yield of paddy improved by 3 per

cent to reach the best average yield of 3,618 kg. per hectare.

The average yield during Maha increased by 4 per cent to

reach 3,670 kg. per hectare which is marginally below the

best Maha yield (3,678 kg. per ha.) of 1987. The average

yield during Yala improved by 1 per cent to 3,529 kg. per

hectare. This is the best Yala yield recorded since the peak

yield of 3,603 kg. per hectare recorded during Yala 1983.

The Uda Walawe area, which recorded the best Yala yields for 10 consecutive years, conceded its place to the Ampara District during Yala 1996. However, during Yala 1997, the Uda Walawe area regained its premier position and recorded the best average yield of 5,008 kg. per hectare (97 bushels per acre). During Maha 1996/97, the best yield of 5,138 kg. per hectare (100 bushels per acre) was, reported from the Mahaweli 'H' area. The entire extent cultivated under paddy in both the Uda Walawe area and Mahaweli 'H' area are under assured major irrigation regimes which reduces the risks in cultivation. Hence the farmers are not reluctant to invest in inputs such as fertiliser and other agro chemicals, resulting in improved yields.

The average yield of all three irrigation regimes, viz., major irrigated, minor irrigated and rainfed, increased during Maha 1996/97 compared to the previous Maha. The average yields of major and minor irrigated areas increased by 10 per cent each to 4.289 kg. per hectare and 3.369 kg. per

hectare, respectively. The average yield of rainfed areas

increased by 7 per cent to 2.843 kg. per hectare. The average

yields of the major irrigated areas which increased by 5 per

cent during Yala 1996 recorded a further 8 per cent

improvement to 4.139 kg. per hectare during Yala 1997. The

average yield of the rainfed areas during Yala, which

declined during the previous year, recorded a 10 per cent

improvement to 2.519 kg. per hectare. Meanwhile, the

average yield of the minor irrigated areas during Yala

declined by 5 per cent to 2,862 kg. per hectare.

The gross extent cultivated with paddy, which declined

by 18 per cent in the previous cultivation year, recorded a

further 3 per cent decline to 730,000 hectares during the

1996/97 cultivation year. The gross extent sown during the

previous Maha, which dropped by 12 per cent, recorded a

further 5 per cent decrease to 473.000 hectares. Meanwhile,

the gross extent sown during the 1997 Yala season increased

by 3 per cent to 257,000 hectares.

In spite of the decline in the extent sown, the extent

harvested during the 1996/97 cultivation year showed a 5 per

cent improvement over the previous year indicating a sharp

drop in the degree of crop failure. The degree of crop failure

in the cultivation year, which was 12 per cent in the previous

year, fell to 5 per cent during this year. The reduction in

crop failure could be attributed to improved weather

conditions compared to the drought stricken year of 1996.

The degree of crop failure, which was very high at 15 per

cent during 1995/96 Maha, dropped to 6 per cent during

1996/97 Maha. The number of farmers who had obtained

agricultural insurance against crop failures decreased to

20.229. The extent insured too had decreased to 20,896

hectares.

Fertiliser issues to the paddy sector during the cultivation year declined by 1 per cent to 230,000 metric tons compared to the previous year. On the basis of the extents sown, the fertiliser issues per hectare had improved by 1 per cent to 315 kg. per hectare compared to 311 kg. per hectare issued during the 1996 cultivation year. The improvement in the application of fertiliser could be attributed to the improved weather conditions that prevailed during the 1996/97 cultivation year compared to the previous cultivation year. The improvement in the intensity of fertiliser application had a direct impact on increasing the per hectare yield of paddy during the year. Fertiliser application during Maha 1996/97 decreased by 2 per cent' to 140,000 metric tons while the quantity applied during Yala 1997 increased by 1 per cent to 91.000 metric tons.

Credit granted to the paddy sector under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) declined by 3 per cent to Rs.383 million. The quantum of credit granted

40

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

during the 1996/97 Maha season was Rs.275 million

compared to Rs.308 million granted during the previous

Maha season. The amount of credit granted during Yala

1997 was Rs.108 million compared to Rs.88 million granted

during Yala 1996.

Though paddy output during the cultivation year

improved over the drought stricken previous year, it was

only a partial recovery. The production recorded during the

1997 cultivation year was 7 per cent less than the average

production recorded for the last decade. Owing to this drop

in production, the open market price of paddy remained well

above the guaranteed price of Rs.155 per bushel (Rs.7.42 per

kg.). The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) could not purchase

any paddy during the year as the State relied on farmer

organisations to purchase paddy. Credit facilities were

provided to these organisations by the state banks while a

few PMB stores were utilised by some of these farmer

organisations.

The rice equivalent of paddy produced after adjusting

for wastage and seed paddy requirements amounted to 1370

thousand metric tons. Based on the estimated annual

consumption, this accounted for about 74 per cent of the

requirement: The shortfall had to be imported. During the

year 306,000 metric tons were imported as against 341,000

metric tons imported in 1996. Over the years, the per capita

consumption ,of rice has dropped gradually. The

corresponding reduction in the calorie requirement appears

to have been met with an increase in the intake of wheat

flour based food items.

The rice trade experienced a considerable degree of

uncertainity in 1997 and prices varied excessively during the

year as trade policy relating to rice, as well as several other

food commodities remained unpredictable. After a 27 per

cent drop in production in 1996, the Maha harvest recorded

only a 9 per cent increase and the existence of a supply

shortage was known to the market. However, the private

sector appeared unwilling to place import orders in an

unpredictable policy.environment. As in the past, when the

domestic rice prices started to increase sharply, a duty waiver

was granted for a short period. This helped to improve

domestic supply as 181,025 metric tons of rice were

imported during the fourth quarter. Due to the uncertainty,

bondsmen also did not maintain any buffer stocks during

1997. Welfare gains to both producers and consumers could

be enhanced by giving a minimum degree of protection to

the paddy sector, possibly at the maximum rate under the

existing tariff structure, irrespective of whether there is a

shortfall in domestic production or not. It is advisable for

the Government to withdraw from its involvement in the rice

trade.

The recently released paddy variety, Bg 357, bred at the

Rice Research and Development Institute at Batalagoda is

resistant to all economically important pests and diseases and

is highly adaptable to varying climatic zones of the country.

The Department of Agriculture has also released a Basmathi

variety (At 5) which is of high quality and superior yield.

Under the Integrated Pest Management Programme for

Paddy, 'yaya' demonstrations had been held in all the 'Govi

Jana Kendras' except the North and East and a total of 7,770

farmers had been trained under this programme.

Other Field Crops

Other Field Crops (OFCs) consist of a heterogeneous group of crops varying from high value cash crops such as chillies, onions and potatoes, to low value cereals such as maize and kurakkan. Most high value crops are grown very intensively, at times under irrigated conditions, while low value crops are often grown in a very ad hoc manner in home gardens or in chena lands under rainfed conditions. Hence, most available data with respect to OFCs are crude estimates.

Provisional estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics indicate a poor performance of major OFCs during 1997, particularly of high value cash crops such as chillies (especially in Yala 1997) and potatoes. However, big onion production increased by 16 per cent from 19,400 metric tons in 1996 to 22,500 metric tons in 1997. This was mainly due to the improvement in the average yield by 4 per cent to 7.6 metric tons per hectare in 1997 and an increase in the extent under cultivation by 11 per cent. In contrast, potato production declined drastically during the year by 34 per cent to 66,500 metric tons in 1997 compared to 100,800 metric tons produced in 1996. This was attributed to the drop in extent cultivated from 7,900 hectares in 1996, to 6,400 hectares in 1997. The average yield of potatoes declined by 19 per cent. The production of chillies declined by 2 per cent from 18,400 metric tons in 1996 to 18,100 metric tons in 1997. However, the extent cultivated with chillies declined, by 8 per cent from 26,100 hectares in 1996 to' 24,100 hectares during the year under review. In the 1996/97 Maha season the extent cultivated with chillies increased by 2 per cent, while production increased by 10 per cent. However, in the 1997 Yala season the extent cultivated with chillies declined substantially by 23 per cent followed by a decline in production of 2l per cent. The average yield of chillies increased by 6 per cent. The poor performance of these two crops is attributed to the removal of excessive protection given to these crops in the past in the form of quantitative restrictions through import licensing.

Sesame production recorded a 74 per cent increase to

6,600 metric tons when compared to 3,800 metric tons

41

Part 1

produced in 1996. The extent cultivated under sesame too

increased by 55 per cent from 7,500 hectares in 1996 to

11,700 hectares in 1997. This may be attributed to increased

cultivation of sesame, especially in the Yala season; on land

earlier cultivated with cash crops such as chillies. Red onion

production increased marginally in 1997. Cowpea production

which was 17,000 metric tons in 1996, declined by 18 per

cent to 14,000 metric tons in 1997. The production of black

gram, maize, green gram and soya beans recorded decreases

of 8 per cent, 22 per cent, 10 per cent and 43 per cent,

respectively, in 1997 when compared to the previous year.

The drop in production of these crops during 1997 may be

attributed to reduced extents under cultivation.

It has been observed that the decline in production of high value cash crops such as chillies and potatoes was mainly due to farmers facing difficulties .in marketing their output due to the availability of cheaper imported varieties. The imports of these commodities were liberalised by the Government in 1996 while duty waivers were provided in an ad hoc manner to further bring down prices. The cost of production of local farmers is relatively high when compared to the cost of production of farmers in India, which is the source of most of the imported chillies, onions and potatoes, largely due to differences in yields, input subsidies and wage costs. Imports of consumption potatoes increased more than four fold from 25,740 metric tons in 1996 to 108375 metric tons in 1997. The CIF price had declined by 25 per cent in 1997. Seed potato imports declined by 78 per cent to 1,122 metric tons mainly due to the decrease in the cultivation of potatoes which is no longer a remunerative crop. The import of dried chillies increased by 36 per cent from 9,777 metric tons in 1996 to 13,269 metric tons in 1997. The import price had declined by 47 per cent in 1997. The bumper chillie crop in India also contributed to the drastic decline in import price. The import of big onions too increased by 34 per cent to 119,317 metric tons with import prices (CIF) declining by 10 per cent. Although the consumers benefitted, producers who were heavily protected earlier were adversely affected by the decline in import price.

The average producer price of chillies, was Rs.98.30 per

kg. in March 1996. This decreased by 16 per cent to

Rs.82.07 per kg. in March 1997. The average producer price

of potatoes also decreased by 23 per cent to Rs.l6.20 per

kg. in March 1997. Likewise the average producer price of

big onions, which was Rs.15.83 per kg. in September 1996,

declined by 13 per cent to Rs.13.83 per kg. in September

1997.

The Government, having realised the need to give a

certain degree of protection to local farmers, introduced a

producer price scheme for selected important OFCs in

August 1997. The recommended price ranges were: chillies

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1C::'

Rs. 55 - Rs. 70 per kg., big onion Rs. 12 - Rs. 14 per kg.,

potato Rs. 20 - Rs. 25 per kg., maize Rs. 10 - Rs. 12 per

kg., green gram Rs. 30 - Rs. 40 per kg., cowpea Rs. 15 -

Rs. 20 per kg., toor dhal Rs. 20 - Rs; 30 per kg., ground

nut Rs. 15 - Rs. 25 per kg. and red onion Rs. 15 - Rs.18

per kg. Under this scheme the Co-operative Wholesale

Establishment (CWE) is expected to purchase these

commodities within the price range whenever producer prices

fall. The price range provides the CWE with a certain degree

of flexibility to decide on the purchase price depending on

the quality of the commodity. The CWE purchases of dried

chillies in 1997 declined by 3 per cent to 1,797 metric tons

while purchases of big onions increased by 44 per cent to

1,570 metric tons.

Studies of the comparative costs of production of big

onions, chillies and potatoes in Sri Lanka and India

conducted in 1997 have revealed that the major reasons for

the low average cost of production in India are due to low

rural wages and the Indian Government providing extensive

subsidies for fertiliser, agro chemicals, power, irrigation and

high yielding seed varieties. Thereby, a larger share of actual

costs in India is borne by the State. In addition various

interventions by the State in the market reduce marketing

risks of the farmer. In Sri Lanka the largest cost component

of the cost of production of these agricultural crops is labour.

For example, in the case of big onions it is nearly 53 per

cent while in India it is about 26 per cent. The average

yields of onions and chillies in Sri Lanka are comparable

with those of India. Sri Lanka will have to substantially

increase productivity of resources employed in agriculture,

especially labour, in addition to rapid modernisation of

agriculture to be able to compete with cheaper imported

commodities. As an immediate step, a reasonable degree of

protection at the maximum tariff rate of 35 per cent may

be provided for a stipulated period with a plan for a gradual

reduction thereafter. These measures need to be transparent

so that farmers are well informed and prepared to allocate

resources at the optimum level.

The need to increase the availability of suitable quality

seed materials to farmers is also important to increase yields.

In keeping with the new policy on seed material, the private

sector should be able to produce or import an adequate

quantity of quality seed. However, there are various

constraints such as the non tariff barriers India has imposed

on the export of big onion seeds to Sri Lanka. Hence, the

big onion seeds imported to Sri Lanka are smuggled seeds

. which do not guarantee the quality of seeds. High cost and

poor quality of seeds will have a negative impact on

productivity. These issues need to be resolved at negotiations

of the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement

(SAPTA).

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Vegetables and Fruits

Vegetable cultivation can be broadly classified into low country vegetables (LCV) and up country vegetables (UCV). LCV are generally cultivated under rainfed conditions on small plots of land or in home gardens using little input by way of fertiliser or pesticides, except in paddy fields during the Yala season under irrigated conditions. Harvesting is on a seasonal basis. UCV are cultivated more intensively under irrigated conditions in the Nuwara Eliya, Bandarawela and Welimada areas and most of these vegetables are temperate varieties. The cultivation is staggered (not confined to the Maha and Yala seasons) and harvesting is carried out throughout the year. Commercial cultivation of vegetables with heavy capital investment has been started recently and is becoming increasingly popular due to higher returns. As vegetable production is carried out by a large number of small scale producers scattered throughout the country, the data on vegetable production are only rough estimates. According to estimates provided by the Department of Census and Statistics(DCS), vegetable production declined by about 2 per cent in 1997, to approximately 419,000 metric tons, when compared to production in 1996. This decline is mainly attributed to a 5 per cent decline in LCV production (e.g. okra, tomatoes, snake gourd, etc.) both in the Maha and Yala seasons, to 260,000 metric tons. In contrast, the production of UCV such as leeks and radish increased by 3 per cent to 159,000 metric tons. Sri Lanka does not have well managed fruit orchards as in other countries. However, pineapples are cultivated in a more organised manner as an inter-crop under coconut, especially in the Gampaha District. Production of fruits such as plantains, mango, papaw and pineapple declined by 5 per cent in 1997 to 6,646 million fruits. According to estimates of the DCS, plantains and cashew nuts accounted for 63 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, of this total.

Seasonal demand and continuous rain in the last quarter of 1997 which hampered the supply of vegetables, contributed to a sharp increase in prices. In addition to consumer demand for vegetables and fruits, there was increased demand for these items from the tourist industry as well as from the export sector. Vegetable and fruit (fresh and dried ) exports in 1997, which were 6,869 metric tons and 9,886 metric tons, respectively, increased by 2 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively, when compared to the previous year. Most vegetable exports are to countries in the Middle East, which have a very large South Asian population, and to the Maldives. In order to meet the supply shortfall of vegetables in the domestic market, 750 metric tons of vegetables were imported in 1997, compared to 695 metric tons imported in 1996. In addition, 19,511 metric tons of fresh and dried fruits (such as dates) were imported in 1997, in comparison to imports of 16,733 metric tons in 1996. Accordingly, Sri Lanka is a net importer of fruits.

The Department of Agriculture (DOA) is continually

investigating new food crops with better returns and greater

growth potential to replace traditional food crops cultivated

in the wet and dry zones. Grape and strawberry cultivation,

respectively in the dry zone and higher elevations and leafy

vegetable cultivation in the low country wet zone have been

explored. These crops are considered to have a very high

income generating ability. A study by the DOA to seek

alternatives to improve the productivity of paddy land in the

low country wet zone and increase farm incomes by the

cultivation of leafy vegetables in certain paddy lands in the

Colombo and Gampaha Districts had shown certain positive

. results. However, constraints such as environmental factors

(soil quality, drainage and salinity) and increased demand for

hired labour for field activities in the diversification of paddy

lands need to be resolved. Preliminary studies are being

conducted by the DOA on the profitability of vegetable

cultivation in« unproductive paddy lands.

Studies by the DOA have shown that farmers can

reduce the cost of cultivation of vegetables and increase their

incomes by adopting recommended seed rates of new

varieties, using straight fertilisers and application of

recommended pesticides. However, constraints such as the

availability of adequate irrigation water, difficulties in finding

hired labour as most farmers are part time cultivators,

remain. Encouraging farmers to participate in training and

demonstration programmes is considered necessary to

increase agricultural productivity.

Sugar

Sugar production during 1997, estimated at 63.897 metric tons, was 9 per cent lower than the 70,414 metric tons produced in .1996. All three factories, namely Hingurana, Sevanagala and Pelwatta, recorded lower output levels. The highest decline of 45 per cent from 10,830 metric tons in 1996 to 5,887 metric tons in 1997 was recorded at the Hingurana factory. The Sevenagala and Pel watte sugar

factories recorded an 8 per cent and 1 per cent drop in production, respectively, from 1996 to 1997. The Hingurana factory was beset with problems of mismanagement and labour unrest and the company was vested with the Government on 21 January 1997. During 1997, there was a drastic reduction in the area harvested (by 30 per cent) and the quantity of cane crushed (by 44 per cent). In most months the factory did not operate but due to pressure from private growers for a return on their investment in growing cane, the company purchased their cane and sent it to be crushed at the Pelwatta factory. In the second half of the year, the company started to produce wine spirits and alcohol. In 1997, the quantity of cane crushed at the Sevanagala factory declined by 5 per cent while at the Pelwatta factory it increased by 1 per cent. As in the last two years there was no production of sugar at the Kantale factory during 1997. .

. In 1997, the average yield of cane at Sevenagala increased by 8 per cent to 70 metric tons per hectare. In contrast, the average yield at the Pelwatta factory was very much less at 41 metric tons per hectare. However, when compared to 1996, the average yield at the Pelwatta factory had increased by 11 per cent in 1997. The increase in the average yield in nucleus estates as a result of favourable weather that prevailed during the year may have contributed to the yield increase at Pelwatta. The sugar recovery rate for both Hingurana and Sevenagala factories dropped by 3 per cent each in 1997, when compared to 1996. At the Pelwatte factory* the decline in the recovery rate was 2 per cent. The

overall sugar recovery rate declined marginally to 8.16 per cent.

At Sevenagala, private cane purchases, although small

in volume compared to the other two factories, increased

significantly by 39 per cent to 2,437 metric tons in 1997

from 1,754 metric tons in 1996. Cane purchases from the

private sector by the Pelwatte factory increased marginally

and reached 462,000 metric tons, while purchases by the

Hingurana factory were 26,000 metric tons.

In 1997, domestic sugar production was adequate to meet only about 10 per cent of the country's sugar consumption requirements compared to 15 per cent recorded in 1996. The quantity of sugar imported during 19.97 was .545,158 metric tons, a 43 per cent increase compared to 381,158 metric tons imported in 1996. Thus, the performance of the sugar industry in the country has been far below . . expectations and has deteriorated over the years. However, import duty has been maintained at higher levels to protect the industry. Presently, import duty is.at 25 per cent, increased from 18 per cent on 11 August 1997. The general level of import duty for sugar is 35 per cent. The 10 per cent duty reduction was to ease the burden on the consumer. In November 1997, a new sugar factory was established under Board of Investment regulations at Siyambalanduwa in the Moneragala District, with a capacity to crush 1,250 tons of cane per day (TCD). The capacity is to be further expanded to 2000 TCD.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

3.5 Fish and Livestock

Fish

Total fish production in 1997 has been provisionally

estimated by the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources

Development (MFARD) at 240,000 metric tons, an increase

of 5 per cent. Marine fish production (coastal, deep sea and

off shore) contributed 212,750 metric tons which was an

increase of 3 per cent over 1996. The resumption of fishing

in certain areas in the North arid East, where fishing was

banned earlier due to security reasons, helped to increase

marine fish production. The increase in the number of multi-

day boats in the deep sea fishing fleet also helped to step

up production. .

Aquaculture fish production (inland, coastal brackish

water prawn culture and cultured prawns) during 1997

showed a significant improvement of 22 per cent to register

27,250 metric tons. This was mainly due to improvement in

the inland fisheries sector resulting from an increase in the

release of fingerlings to tanks, adequate water in tanks due

to favourable distribution of rainfall, better management and

co-ordination and more awareness programs. During the year,

the MFARD continued with the rehabilitation work on the

Dambulla, Udawalawe and Iginiyagala inland fisheries

development centres. The Iginiyagala inland fisheries centre

was taken over from the private sector in September 1996,

after which repair work was initiated by the MFARD in

1997. Although the white spot viral infection affecting

prawns in the prawn farms in the North Western Province

was controlled in the third quarter of 1996, it broke out

again in mid December 1996. This had a negative impact

on prawn production in 1997 as nearly 90 per cent of the

farms became non-operational. There are nearly 900 prawn

farms covering an extent of about 3,000 hectares. The

majority of prawn farmers are small-scale operators with an

area less than 1 hectare in extent. Most farm operators were

not able to repay their loans or carry out remedial measures

due to lack of financial resources and this necessitated

government assistance. Financial assistance was channeled

through the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon

Bank (DFCC) for modification of affected farms. This

enabled the construction of sedimentation reservoirs (for

small farms) and recycling systems (for large farms) to arrest

the spread of the disease. In addition, under the Food and

Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Technical Co-operation

Programme, assistance has been provided to improve the

diagnostic capabilities of relevant institutions and train

research officers and scientists. Training is also provided to

prawn farmers on disease prevention and control. The Prawn

Farmers and Exporters Association provides resource

personnel and consultants for these training programmes.

The private sector dominates the fisheries sector.

However, the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation (CFC) is

involved in the supply of fish to consumers at a reasonable

price through its countrywide sales outlets. In 1997, total fish

supply of the CFC was 2,144 metric tons, which was an

increase of 3 per cent. The CFC is also engaged in the

production of ice for the fisheries sector. In. 1997, CFC ice

production increased by 2 per cent to 6,947 metric tons.

Considering the highly capital intensive nature of" the

fishing industry, MFARD continued to provide various

subsidies to the fishing industry to overcome constraints

faced in the modernisation of the fishing fleet and fishing

gear. Under the producer subsidy schemes 55 day boats, 52

multi-day boats and 383 traditional crafts were issued in

1997 when compared to 202 day boats, 53 multi-day boats

and 405 traditional crafts in 1996; The decline in the issue

of day boats was to discourage the over exploitation of

coastal fisheries resources in the Southern and Western seas

as a consequence of fishing being banned in the Northern

and Eastern coastal areas in the past few years. More

encouragement is provided to deep sea fishing. Productivity

is higher by fishing in multi-day boats that are able to stay

out in the deep sea for nearly 15 days. The subsidies issued

to the marine fisheries sector declined by 19 per cent to

Rs.65 million, while the subsidy issued to the aquaculture

sector increased by 33 per cent to Rs.4 million. The

aquaculture sector has the potential to meet the demand for

fish from the interior villages of the country and to provide

products for the export market. The reorganisation of

Fisheries Co-operative Societies (FCSS) commenced in 1996

and by 1997 there were 746 FCSS. The total membership

of the FCSS was 77,656. However, past experience has

shown that Government intervention in forming FCSS has

hindered the development of these institutions as self-

supporting peoples' organisations. State assistance is

disbursed through the FCSS.

The average producer price of all species of fish

increased by 10 per cent to Rs.l 10 per kg. in 1997. The

45

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

average retail price for all species of fish increased by 8 per

cent to Rs.154 per kg. in 1997 from Rs.143 per kg. recorded

in 1996. The highest retail price recorded for a kg. of fish

was Rs.297 for 'Seer' (a large species) while the lowest

average retail price recorded was Rs.65 per kg, for 'Salaya'

(a small species). In order to meet the increasing demand

for fish, which is a major source of protein of the population,

total fish imports increased by 18 per cent to 73,950 metric

tons in 1997. Canned fish imports increased significantly by

44 per cent to 21,925 metric tons and salted fish (dry fish)

imports increased by 11 per cent to 48,782 metric tons.

In the past, the major variety of fish exported has been

prawns. However, in recent years, the category of fresh and

frozen fish exports have increased significantly and in 1997

it increased by 30 per cent to 3,251 metric tons from 2,494

metric tons recorded in 1996. This is mainly attributed to

the export of fish landed by foreign vessels at harbours

managed by the Ceylon Fisheries Harbours Corporation.

These vessels that fish outside Sri Lanka's Exclusive

Economic Zone (EEZ) have established joint ventures in Sri

Lanka under the Board of Investment regulations. The export

of prawns declined by 18 per cent to 2,584 metric tons in

1997 mainly due to the drop in production as a result of the

white spot viral infection. However, earnings from prawn

exports declined by only 7 per cent as a result of favourable

prices received in foreign markets. There is a great potential

for prawn exports to the Japanese, USA and European Union

markets in spite of these importing countries enforcing strict

quality requirements. The MFARD is taking action to

improve fish landing sites and the quality and safety of fish

processing at fish processing establishments.

Livestock

Although the livestock industry comprises several sub-

sectors, dairy and poultry industries are the most prominent

and organised sectors at present. The livestock sector

contributes about 8 per cent to the gross value of agricultural

production and is dominated by the private sector. A small

contribution of about 2 per cent by the National Livestock

Development Board (NLDB) to total milk production

continued in 1997 as well.

. The Department of Census and Statistics estimates that

national cow milk production increased by 1 per cent from

approximately 249 million litres in 1996 to 252 million litres

in 1997. In contrast, buffalo milk production in 1997 had

decreased by 4 per cent to 79 million litres. In 1997, the

NLDB farms produced about 4.1 million litres of cow milk

which was a decrease of 7 per cent when compared with

1996 and about 0.7 million litres of buffalo milk which was

an increase of 8 per cent when compared to 1996.

Milk Industries of Lanka company Ltd. (MILCO), the

largest milk collector in the country accounted for about 50

per cent of the share in national milk collection, which

amounted to 57.5 million litres of milk in 1997. This was

an increase of 6 per cent over the previous yearis collection

of 54 million litres. This could be attributed to better prices

paid to producers since 1996 (Rs.l2.64 per litre) as well as

favourable weather conditions due to well distributed rainfall

in 1997 for pasture or fodder growth. The volume of milk

collected by Nestle Lanka Ltd. (NLL) decreased by 5 per

cent from 36.8 million litres in 1996 to 35.1 million litres

in 1997, while the volume collected by International Dairy

Producers Ltd. (IDPL) decreased by 24 per cent in the same

period. Other milk processing industries increased collection

by more than fourfold to 12 million litres in 1997.

Value added milk products of MILCO increased in

1997. Accordingly, the production of pasteurised full cream

milk declined marginally by 2 per cent, while flavoured milk

increased by 17 per cent. Full cream and flavoured sterilised

milk production increased by 17 per cent each since there

was a greater demand for these products. Cultured milk

products such as yoghurt and drinking yoghurt increased by

10 per cent and processed cheese production increased more

than twofold to 22,000 kg. In 1997 MILCO's full cream

milk powder production increased by nearly 10 per cent to

4.5 million kg. Output of milk products by NLL decreased

by 7 per cent from approximately 6,000 metric tons in 1996

to 5,600 metric tons in 1997. This was attributed to

utilisation of a large carried forward stock of 1996.

Milk production in 1997 remained around 20 per cent

of the country's requirement of milk and milk products. The

country has the potential to be self sufficient in milk and

milk products and steps have been taken to step up milk

production. On 30 September 1997, preliminary work relating

to change in ownership of MILCO to Kiriya Milk Industries

Co. Ltd., a joint venture between the Government of Sri

Lanka and the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)

of India was initiated.

The poultry industry, which is dominated by the private

sector, includes a large number of small producers and a few

large producers. It also has a conglomeration feature of a

combination of poultry feed manufacturers and producers of

poultry products. According to the Department of Census and

Statistics, egg production in the country decreased marginally

from 856 million in 1996 to 855 million in 1997. This was

attributed to the viral infection affecting chicks in mid 1997.

Egg production of the NLDB farms in 1997 was around 4

million which was a decrease of nearly 52 per cent oyer the

production in 1996. As a result of a drop in egg supplies

and greater demand for eggs due to the increase in the price

of fish in the third quarter of 1997, egg prices rose sharply.

46

P a r t 1 • Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

The price of eggs continued to remain high towards the end

of the year due to seasonal demand and the increase in

demand for eggs due to the outbreak of cholera in the

Negombo fishing areas. Favourable prices for eggs have

encouraged poultry producers to increase production. This

would have an impact in 1998. The cost of production has

been estimated at around Rs.3.50 per egg'. According to the

Ministry of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure

chicken production in 1997 was around 40,000 metric tons,

which was a 5 per cent increase over the production in 1996.

Attractive prices and increase in demand for chicken due to

the high prices of substitute animal protein such as fish and

mutton have provided a good market for poultry products.

The average retail price of broiler chicken which was Rs.l 13

per kg. in December 1996, increased by 24 per cent to

Rs.140 per kg. in December 1997.

The decline in international prices of raw materials used

in animal feed enabled the price of feed to be fairly stable

throughout 1997. Attractive output prices with fairly stable

input prices created a conducive environment to producers

in the livestock industry and the country's poultry market

recovered from its recession in 1996.

3.6 Inputs and Credit

The expectations of farmers regarding their farm income

are greatly influenced by the movements in input prices. Any

increase in input prices should generally be compensated by

a corresponding increase in the prices of the final product,

but this may not always be possible. It was also observed

that the existence of attractive producer prices influenced

proper utilisation of inputs on time.

Fertiliser

Fertiliser used during the 1997 calendar year increased

marginally to 524,558 metric tons. However, among

plantation crops, only tea recorded an increase in fertiliser

usage. Improved prices for tea which prevailed throughout

the year and favourable weather conditions contributed to

enhanced fertiliser application by 4 per cent. Fertiliser issues

to the rubber and coconut sectors declined by 28 per cent

and 11 per cent, respectively, compared to the previous year.

A significant decrease in fertiliser usage in the rubber sector

reported in 1997 could be attributed to the decline in rubber

prices. The decline in the issue of fertiliser to the coconut

sector may be attributed to reduced use of sulphate of

ammonia (SA) as a result of high prices after the removal

of the subsidy on SA. On a calendar year basis, fertiliser

used in the paddy sector increased by 3 per cent when

compared with the previous year. Increased application of

fertiliser in the paddy sector could be attributed to an assured

supply of irrigation water during the 1997/98 Maha season.

Fertiliser issues to the export agricultural crop sector also

recorded a 14 per cent increase, which may be attributed to

the overall improvement in producer prices that encouraged

fertiliser application.

The fertiliser subsidy scheme in respect of four major

varieties of fertiliser, namely, urea, sulphate of ammonia,

muriate of potash and triple super phosphate continued till

end September 1997. However, this scheme was revised with

effect from October 1997. Under the new scherne, the

fertiliser subsidy was confined to urea fertiliser only. The

objective of this revision was to provide a higher benefit to

small farmers. Approximately, 75 per cent of the urea

fertiliser used in the country is for the cultivation of paddy.

Under the revised scheme, the retail price was fixed at

Rs.7,000 per metric ton or Rs.350 per 50 kg. bag. The new

scheme is subject to revision on a seasonal basis.

Seed

The national seed policy (the policy of the Government

of Sri Lanka on the Seed and Planting Material Industry)

was officially declared in 1997. Guidelines have been

provided to encourage private sector participation in

producing the country's requirement of quality seed and

planting material. Viable seed industries are to be established

to facilitate the Sri Lankan farming community to gain easy

access to good quality seed and planting material from

domestic sources or through importation. Therefore, the new

policy is focussed towards the establishment of seed

enterprises, which will produce and market the seed and

planting material. The DOA will co-ordinate and provide the

required support to ensure quality of seed and planting

material. In this regard, several workshops were held in

Colombo and the outstations to explain the content and

facilities available to the public and private sectors.

In November 1997, the Government announced in the

1998 Budget various measures that would be taken to make

available an adequate quantity of quality seed material. The

. DOA, the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL),

farmers and private sector enterprises are expected to meet

the seed requirement through local production and imports.

In the case of seed paddy^ in the 5 major rice producing

districts of Ampara, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Anuradhapura

and Hambantota, five acre seed farms among paddy farmers

are to be developed to increase seed production. The DOA

would provide quality seed for reproduction as well as the

necessary extension services. The Pelwehera, Polonnaruwa

and Hingurakgoda seed.production farms of the DOA would

concentrate on developing high yielding seed. The DOA is

also expected to give certain seed farms On long term lease

to the private sector for commercial seed production. The

DOA is expected to enhance its extension services by a

mobile agricultural technology service in these 5 districts to

improve field level testing, fertiliser application and use of

quality seed that would result in increased yields. To

strengthen agricultural extension services, a performance

incentive by way of a reward is expected to be given to

those officers who achieve their production targets. In

November 1997, the Government further announced that the

import of seed cleaning machines, sorting and grading

machines, seed testing equipment and seed packing machines

would be made duty free.

The quantity of seed paddy issued by the DOA in 1997

declined by 2 per cent to 3,600 metric tons. The DOA is

able to fulfil about 3 per cent of the national seed paddy

requirement, while the balance is met by paddy farmers,

farmer organisations, co-operatives, private companies,

MASL and Provincial Councils. Only a part of the seed

paddy production of these institutions had been certified by

the DOA. The issue of OFC seeds such as chillies, black

gram, maize and groundnuts by the DOA increased

substantially in 1997. A major portion of the seed

requirements of OFCs is met by the farmers. However, the

seed requirements of potatoes and big onions are mostly

imported'.

A drought tolerant cowpea variety ('Dhawala') suitable

for cultivation in Yala and late Maha, another cowpea variety

('Sena') and a pigeonpea variety ('Prasada') giving excellent

ratoon yields were the new varieties released by the DOA

to farmers in 1997. In addition, two sweet potato varieties,

a few other root and tuber crops and a papaya variety

('Rathna') suitable for the dry and intermediate zones were

also released for cultivation by the DOA in 1997.

Agro Chemicals

According to provisional estimates provided by the

Registrar of Pesticides (ROP), the total quantity of agro

chemicals (insecticides, weedicides and fungicides) sales in

1997 declined by 6 per cent compared to the provisional

figures of 1996. The quantity of weedicides, which account

for about 50 per cent of total agro chemical sales, increased

by 6 per cent to 2,985 metric tons, while insecticide sales

declined by 10 per cent to 2,144 metric tons. The quantity

of fungicide sales also declined by 31 per cent to 579 metric

tons.

Increased sales of weedicides may be attributed to

increased dependency by farmers on chemical weed control

measures. The decline in sales of insecticides, may be due

to the promotion of Integrated Pest Management methods

(where straight application of insecticides are being

discouraged). In November 1997, the Government announced

the exemption of customs duty on agro chemical imports.

Credit

Low productivity, frequently referred to and highlighted

in the agricultural sector, could be partly attributed to poor

timing and inadequate utilisation of required inputs. In this

regard, credit constraint is a major factor that needs special

consideration. According to the available data, demand and

utilisation of agricultural credit in the informal sector appears

to be less encouraging.

In 1997, the commercial banks continued to grant cultivation loans with their own funds while the Government provided an interest subsidy of 7.5 per cent per annum. The total quantum of credit granted under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) during the 1996/97 cultivation year remained at the same level of Rs. 586 million when compared to the previous year.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Sixty eight per cent of the total loans granted amounting to Rs.398 million was on account of the 1996/97 Maha season, while the balance Rs.188 million was granted during Yala 1997. Loans granted during the Yala season increased by 33 per cent due to enhanced cultivation activities, when compared With the loans granted in 1996. As in the previous year, of the total loans granted two thirds amounting to Rs.383 million was granted for paddy and the balance was granted for other field crops. Two state banks, namely Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank disbursed 68 per cent of the total loan quantum which was a decline of about 10 per cent when compared to the previous year. The loans granted by the Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) during the year increased by 11 per cent to Rs.89 million.

3.7 Forestry

Forests and forest resources are vital for the sustenance and conservation of water resources, soils, animal and plant life and mitigation of atmospheric pollution, etc. Forest resources also supply economic requirements such as fuel wood, timber and medicine.

Based on a survey carried out in 1992 by the Forest Department (FD), total forest cover has been estimated at approximately 2 million hectares. Closed canopy forests including mangroves is estimated at around 1.6 million hectares, while sparse forest cover is about 0.5 million hectares. Viable forest plantations are estimated at around 72^50 hectares. The extent deforested (clear felled) from forest plantations fof the supply of timber in 1997 was 205 hectares. During the year this area was reforested by the FD.

Reforestation programs have been implemented by the FD to minimise the negative impact of deforestation on the environment, to protect environmentally sensitive areas and to provide for the increase in demand for fuel wood and timber.

The number of forest offences recorded in 1997 increased by 3 per cent to 5,158 as against 5,014 recorded in 1996. However, the volume of illicitly felled timber detected declined by 36 per cent to 2,488 cubic meters, while the value declined by 17 per cent to Rs.30 million. Increased surveillance and stringent regulations in the transportation of timber has had a positive impact on illegal deforestation.

Several projects in environmental management were undertaken by the FD in 1997. The Sinharaja and Knuckles Conservation Projects were carried out with foreign aid amounting to Rs.8 million from the Norwegian Development Programme (NORAD) which was completely utilised. NORAD assistance totalling Rs.l million of which 95 per cent was utilised was provided for the Mangrove Conservation Project. Activities under these projects included conservation area management, buffer zone management, survey of mangrove habitats, extension, awareness and training programs and the construction and maintenance of buildings and roads. The Asian Development Bank and Australian Aid (AUSAID) provided funds amounting to Rs.l 15 million of which 95 per cent was utilised for the Participatory Forestry Project. Under this.project 9.3 million seedlings were produced in 1997 and forest plantations were, raised through homestead development (7,857 hectares), farmer woodlots (2,035 hectares), protective woodlots (1,254 hectares) and through miscellaneous tree planting programmes (696 hectares block planting and 396 km. avenue planting). Tree improvement activities have also been carried out during 1997. In 1997 the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) had provided funds equivalent to Rs.100,000 for research activities which were fully utilised.

A Five Year Implementation Program has been prepared for the next 5 years, within the context of the Forestry Sector Master Plan by the FD. The programme comprises 7 major components.

• Forest land allocation and macro level zoning

• Forest conservation management

• Multiple use management of natural forests

• Commercial plantation development

• Social/agro forestry and extension

• Forest based industry development-

• Institutional development
