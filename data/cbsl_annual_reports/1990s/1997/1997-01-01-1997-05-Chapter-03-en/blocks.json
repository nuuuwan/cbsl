Due to the shortfall in production, rice prices showed an upward movement in 1997. Pressure on rice prices was further aggravated towards the end of 1997 due to supply bottlenecks caused by heavy rains. Consequently, as in 1996, the Government intervened in the market and waived the 35 per cent duty on imported rice from 20 November 1997 until the end of January 1998 just prior to the commencement of the 1997/98 Maha harvest. The import tariff on potatoes, chillies and onions, which was reduced to 20 per cent from 35 per cent in December 1996, continued at that level until 31 January 1997, which resulted in a heavy influx of imports of these commodities.",

Cess assistance services of the CCB are targeted at private sector smallholders and are not provided to public sector estates or plantations over 4 hectares in extent. Through CCB assistance, the extent replanted during the year was 1221 hectares, a more than twofold increase over 1996. The extent newly planted increased by 11 per cent to 931 hectares. In addition, the CCB provided coconut plants free of charge to home gardens (not exceeding 10 plants per cultivator) where the land had been prepared as stipulated by the CCB. The CCB aims to encourage home garden production for domestic use in order to release estate output for export oriented coconut kernel processing industries. The plants issued to home gardens increased marginally to 1.1 million plants. Favourable weather conditions enabled an improvement in these field activities in 1997. However, fertiliser issued to the coconut sector decreased by 11 per . cent to 34,700 metric tons. This is attributed to the reduction in the use of sulphate of ammonia (SA) fertiliser by about 40 per cent compared to 1996 on account of the removal of the subsidy on SA in September 1997.",

    "text": "According to the Coconut Development Authority (CDA) estimates, the cost of production (COP) had increased by 4 per cent to Rs.2.26 per nut in 1997: However, in large plantations, the COP had gone up to around Rs.3.50 per nut. Fresh nut retail prices were at record levels at an average of Rs.l3.15 per nut in the first four months of the year, compared to Rs.9.30 per nut in the previous year. This was mainly due to the spillover of the shortfall in supply experienced in 1996. Prices declined in mid 1997 with the improvement in supply and rose again in the last quarter of the year with the onset of the lean period. The average retail price in 1997 was Rs.l 1.85 per nut, an increase of 26 per cent. Coconut oil prices in the local market showed a declining trend from the record levels registered at the beginning of the year. Improved nut supply and enhanced imports of vegetable oil substitutes resulted in lower prices. International prices of coconut oil too declined shaiply in 1997 due to the improvement in coconut oil supplies from the leading exporter, the Philippines, as well as the increase in world supply of substitute vegetable oils. In January 1997, the average international price of coconut oil was US dollars 784 (c.i.f Rotterdam) per metric ton, while in the sanie month in 1996 it was US dollars 709 per metric ton. By December, the price declined to US dollars 584 (c.i.f Rotterdam) per metric ton. The currency crisis in East Asian countries also contributed to the drop in coconut oil prices. International prices of copra followed a similar pattern as for coconut oil.",

The production of nutmeg, cinnamon leaf oil and coffee declined. Clove production, which has shown a declining trend over the years due to unremunerative prices, reported a significant improvement in 1997. Clove production is estimated to have increased by 62 per cent over the previous year, mainly due to favourable weather conditions that prevailed during the flowering season. However, most of the farmers do not pick the entire harvest due to the high cost of harvesting. India still continues to impose non-tariff barriers to restrict the entry of cloves. The removal of non-tariff barriers to improve the export of cloves to India should be a priority at the negotiations of the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA).",

The improvement in the application of fertiliser could be attributed to the improved weather conditions that prevailed during the 1996/97 cultivation year compared to the previous cultivation year. The improvement in the intensity of fertiliser application had a direct impact on increasing the per hectare yield of paddy during the year. Fertiliser application during Maha 1996/97 decreased by 2 per cent' to 140,000 metric tons while the quantity applied during Yala 1997 increased by 1 per cent to 91.000 metric tons.",

    "text": "Provisional estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics indicate a poor performance of major OFCs during 1997, particularly of high value cash crops such as chillies (especially in Yala 1997) and potatoes. However, big onion production increased by 16 per cent from 19,400 metric tons in 1996 to 22,500 metric tons in 1997. This was mainly due to the improvement in the average yield by 4 per cent to 7.6 metric tons per hectare in 1997 and an increase in the extent under cultivation by 11 per cent. In contrast, potato production declined drastically during the year by 34 per cent to 66,500 metric tons in 1997 compared to 100,800 metric tons produced in 1996. This was attributed to the drop in extent cultivated from 7,900 hectares in 1996, to 6,400 hectares in 1997. The average yield of potatoes declined by 19 per cent. The production of chillies declined by 2 per cent from 18,400 metric tons in 1996 to 18,100 metric tons in 1997. However, the extent cultivated with chillies declined, by 8 per cent from 26,100 hectares in 1996 to' 24,100 hectares during the year under review. In the 1996/97 Maha season the extent cultivated with chillies increased by 2 per cent, while production increased by 10 per cent. However, in the 1997 Yala season the extent cultivated with chillies declined substantially by 23 per cent followed by a decline in production of 2l per cent. The average yield of chillies increased by 6 per cent. The poor performance of these two crops is attributed to the removal of excessive protection given to these crops in the past in the form of quantitative restrictions through import licensing.",

    "text": "It has been observed that the decline in production of high value cash crops such as chillies and potatoes was mainly due to farmers facing difficulties .in marketing their output due to the availability of cheaper imported varieties. The imports of these commodities were liberalised by the Government in 1996 while duty waivers were provided in an ad hoc manner to further bring down prices. The cost of production of local farmers is relatively high when compared to the cost of production of farmers in India, which is the source of most of the imported chillies, onions and potatoes, largely due to differences in yields, input subsidies and wage costs. Imports of consumption potatoes increased more than four fold from 25,740 metric tons in 1996 to 108375 metric tons in 1997. The CIF price had declined by 25 per cent in 1997. Seed potato imports declined by 78 per cent to 1,122 metric tons mainly due to the decrease in the cultivation of potatoes which is no longer a remunerative crop. The import of dried chillies increased by 36 per cent from 9,777 metric tons in 1996 to 13,269 metric tons in 1997. The import price had declined by 47 per cent in 1997. The bumper chillie crop in India also contributed to the drastic decline in import price. The import of big onions too increased by 34 per cent to 119,317 metric tons with import prices (CIF) declining by 10 per cent. Although the consumers benefitted, producers who were heavily protected earlier were adversely affected by the decline in import price.",

    "text": "Vegetable cultivation can be broadly classified into low country vegetables (LCV) and up country vegetables (UCV). LCV are generally cultivated under rainfed conditions on small plots of land or in home gardens using little input by way of fertiliser or pesticides, except in paddy fields during the Yala season under irrigated conditions. Harvesting is on a seasonal basis. UCV are cultivated more intensively under irrigated conditions in the Nuwara Eliya, Bandarawela and Welimada areas and most of these vegetables are temperate varieties. The cultivation is staggered (not confined to the Maha and Yala seasons) and harvesting is carried out throughout the year. Commercial cultivation of vegetables with heavy capital investment has been started recently and is becoming increasingly popular due to higher returns. As vegetable production is carried out by a large number of small scale producers scattered throughout the country, the data on vegetable production are only rough estimates. According to estimates provided by the Department of Census and Statistics(DCS), vegetable production declined by about 2 per cent in 1997, to approximately 419,000 metric tons, when compared to production in 1996. This decline is mainly attributed to a 5 per cent decline in LCV production (e.g. okra, tomatoes, snake gourd, etc.) both in the Maha and Yala seasons, to 260,000 metric tons. In contrast, the production of UCV such as leeks and radish increased by 3 per cent to 159,000 metric tons. Sri Lanka does not have well managed fruit orchards as in other countries. However, pineapples are cultivated in a more organised manner as an inter-crop under coconut, especially in the Gampaha District. Production of fruits such as plantains, mango, papaw and pineapple declined by 5 per cent in 1997 to 6,646 million fruits. According to estimates of the DCS, plantains and cashew nuts accounted for 63 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, of this total.",

In addition to consumer demand for vegetables and fruits, there was increased demand for these items from the tourist industry as well as from the export sector. Vegetable and fruit (fresh and dried ) exports in 1997, which were 6,869 metric tons and 9,886 metric tons, respectively, increased by 2 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively, when compared to the previous year. Most vegetable exports are to countries in the Middle East, which have a very large South Asian population, and to the Maldives. In order to meet the supply shortfall of vegetables in the domestic market, 750 metric tons of vegetables were imported in 1997, compared to 695 metric tons imported in 1996. In addition, 19,511 metric tons of fresh and dried fruits (such as dates) were imported in 1997, in comparison to imports of 16,733 metric tons in 1996. Accordingly, Sri Lanka is a net importer of fruits.",

    "text": "factories recorded an 8 per cent and 1 per cent drop in production, respectively, from 1996 to 1997. The Hingurana factory was beset with problems of mismanagement and labour unrest and the company was vested with the Government on 21 January 1997. During 1997, there was a drastic reduction in the area harvested (by 30 per cent) and the quantity of cane crushed (by 44 per cent). In most months the factory did not operate but due to pressure from private growers for a return on their investment in growing cane, the company purchased their cane and sent it to be crushed at the Pelwatta factory. In the second half of the year, the company started to produce wine spirits and alcohol. In 1997, the quantity of cane crushed at the Sevanagala factory declined by 5 per cent while at the Pelwatta factory it increased by 1 per cent. As in the last two years there was no production of sugar at the Kantale factory during 1997. .",

However, when compared to 1996, the average yield at the Pelwatta factory had increased by 11 per cent in 1997. The increase in the average yield in nucleus estates as a result of favourable weather that prevailed during the year may have contributed to the yield increase at Pelwatta.

The general level of import duty for sugar is 35 per cent. The 10 per cent duty reduction was to ease the burden on the consumer. In November 1997, a new sugar factory was established under Board of Investment regulations at Siyambalanduwa in the Moneragala District, with a capacity to crush 1,250 tons of cane per day (TCD). The capacity is to be further expanded to 2000 TCD.",
