The impact of releasing of liquidity through this measure was immediately felt on the short-term interest rates, mainly the Treasury bill rate and the prime lending rate. The deposit rates also declined, but remained above the inflation'rate. The banks were also unusually cautious in extending new credit, having experienced a rise in non-performing loans due to the effects of the drought and power cuts on some economic activities in 1996. Credit to the private sector gradually increased and the year ended with an 11.4 per cent credit growth. The money supply increased by 13.8 per cent in 1997, a somewhat lower rate than the targeted 14.5 per cent, but higher than the previous year's comparison of 10.8 per cent. The commercial banks, having experienced a decline in their net foreign assets in the previous year, used a major share of the increased liquidity to rebuild their net foreign asset position. The declining rate of return on domestic financial assets was another reason for this behaviour by commercial banks. ,",

    "text": "All available aggregate price indicators showed a substantial deceleration in inflation. The year on year increase in consumer prices, as reflected in the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), was 9.6 per cent in 1997. The Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index (GCPI), which has a wider coverage, indicated a faster decline in consumer price increases, from 14.7 per cent in 1996 to 7.1 per cent in 1997. A provisional price indicator prepared by the Central Bank, using data from the first round of the 1996/ 97 Consumer Finance Survey, indicated a consumer price inflation of 7.3 per cent in 1997. The Wholesale Price Index, which reflects the trends in all prices at the primary market level, showed a 6.9 per cent inflation compared to 20.5 per cent in 1996. The Gross Domestic Product Deflator, which is an implicit price indicator for the whole range of goods and services produced in the country, increased by 8.5 per cent in 1997, compared to 12.2 per cent in 1996.",

Meanwhile, the future rate of growth of the labour force is expected to decline significantly and reach a steady state of zero growth from the year 2010 onwards.

In the short run there is an urgent need to promote investment, particularly in the private sector, for the economy to be able to provide productive employment to the currently unemployed labour force. Labour market policies are complementary to investment promotion policies, as making the labour market more flexible and the labour force more productive and easily adaptable to industry demands would",

In the 1960s, two American economists.

The economy appears to be moving towards a long-run equilibrium low rate of unemployment. The remaining structural impediments mentioned elsewhere need to be eliminated for this trend to be sustained. On inflation, the Monetary Law Act indicates a month over month annual inflation rate of 10 per cent as the upper limit of the desirable rate. This is consistent with many economists' perceptions of a single digit inflation rate desirable for all economies. In the case of Sri Lanka, inflation rate.s of 4-5 per cent should be the medium-term target. Despite the",

In the early sixties, there seemed to have been a trade-off between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate. The adoption of a fixed exchange rate policy, price controls and subsidies and other inward looking policies led to suppressed inflation and high unemployment. After the early 1980s, the trade-off is less pronounced. The period after the early 1990s has seen no trade-off between unemployment and inflation, and in fact, the relationship was positive. The unemployment rate was declining with a declining inflation rate, except in 1996. when the inflation rate surged largely due to the effect of a severe drought (Chart 1). The estimated overall' relationship for the period 1963-1997 (excluding three extreme outlier data points), using a semi-log regression, shows a significant negative relationship (Chart 2).",

However, net credit to government by the entire banking system declined by Rs.2,172 million as commercial bank holdings of Treasury bills increased after the reduction of the SRR. In addition, the Government's stock of administrative borrowings was reduced by Rs.6,654 million in 1996 to Rs.4,584 million in 1997. The 1998 Budget has targetted an overall deficit of 6.5 per cent of GDP (before grants and privatisation). This deficit is expected to be reduced to 4 per cent of GDP by the year 2000.",

In addition, the reduction in the SRR would reduce the effective cost of funds of commercial banks, thus enabling them to reduce their lending rates. This measure also represented a further step in the Central Bank's move away from the use of direct controls to the use of more market oriented instruments in the implementation of monetary policy.

The funds moved back into the credit operations of the commercial banks. Commercial banks also reduced their lending rates somewhat on many of their loan schemes reflecting the impact of the reduction in the SRR on their cost of funds. However, as has been observed by many economists, while increases in SRR are effective in reducing credit, if there is no excess liquidity, reductions in SRR do not necessarily lead to corresponding increases in credit unless there is additional demand for credit. Thus, due to caution on the part of both borrowers and lenders, the realised credit expansion consequent on the reduction in SRR was slower than expected. Together with additional liquidity arising from the inflow of foreign funds into the system, this led to a situation where commercial banks began increasing their portfolio of government securities and reducing the rates offered on deposits, resulting in lower interest rates at Treasury bill auctions. Overall, the reduction in deposit rates exceeded the reduction in lending rates, as evidenced by a fall in the average weighted deposit rate (AWDR) from 12.3 per cent in December 1996, to 10.0 per cent in December",

Short-term Central Bank securities, with maturities of 7 days and 28 days were issued to stabilise the lower end of short-term rates.

Commercial banks exercised greater caution in extending credit from their domestic units. Demand too was constrained, with some borrowers adopting a wait and see approach towards large scale investments, while others resorted to credit from FCBUs or development finance institutions. Some corporate borrowers also obtained funds directly from investors through rights issues and the issue of commercial paper due to a downward rigidity in commercial bank lending rates, reducing the demand for bank credit. However, a somewhat different picture emerges when one considers total lending, inclusive of credit from FCBUs.",

    "text": "\u2022 Another factor which helped to maintain relatively stable financial markets in 1997 in the midst of the East Asian financial market turmoil, was the flexible management of the exchange rate; The exchange market plays a significant role in the rate determination, while the Central Bank intervenes to reduce excessive volatility of rates with a band of 2 per cent between its buying and selling rates. The rate determination is monitored on the basis of a large basket of 24 currencies of competitors and trading partners, while also taking into consideration underlying trends in the balance of payments and other macro economic indicators. However, given the degree of import dependence, particularly for some essential consumer goods, as well as intermediate goods, such as petroleum and fertiliser, and investment goods, the inflation feedback effects are relatively large. The current exchange rate management system has the flexibility to allow the exchange rate to change according to underlying macro economic fundamentals while also giving due consideration to the inflation/exchange rate feedback effect.",
