Part 1 Centra! Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

1. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND POLICIES IN 1997

1.1 Overview

The Sri Lanka economy grew by 6.4 per cent in 1997,

recovering strongly from the depressed conditions that

prevailed in 1996. All major sectors showed significantly

higher growth rates. The inflation rate, as indicated by the

implicit Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator, declined

from 12 per cent in 1996 to 9 per cent in 1997, reflecting

the improved domestic supply situation and a slow rate of

monetary expansion. The unemployment rate declined from

11.1 per cent of the labour force at end 1996 to around 10

per cent, reflecting increased labour absorption mainly in

export oriented manufacturing, tourism and trading activities.

The overall balance of payments showed a surplus of US

dollars 163 million, primarily due to increased earnings from

exports and tourism, higher private transfers and capital

inflows, including privatisation proceeds. Improved fiscal

discipline helped to reduce the budget deficit to 7.9 per cent

of GDP in 1997 from 9.4 per cent in 1996. The recent

improvement in Sri Lanka's macroeconomic conditions, the

maintenance of some capital controls, the low exposure to

short-term foreign debt, enhanced surveillance of financial

market activity and a rise in short-term interest rates towards

the end of the year helped to maintain a reasonable degree

of stability in the domestic financial market in a highly

volatile and uncertain external environment and to avoid a contagion effect of the East Asian crisis. However, it should be noted that the conflict in the North and East of the country continues to take a heavy toll on the economy.

With the recovery from the setback in 1996 and the

decline in the inflation rate, the Central Bank reduced the

statutory reserve requirement (SRR) from 15 per cent to 12

per cent during the first quarter of 1997. This was also a

move towards greater reliance on indirect instruments of

monetary control as well as a move towards a somewhat

lower interest rate regime in the context of improving

macroeconomic fundamentals. A new foreign currency loan

facility through the domestic banks to non-Board of

Investment (BOI) exporters was also introduced in 1997,

subject to the condition that commercial, banks do not

increase their net foreign exposure above 15 per cent of their

capital funds. The use of this facility, on a net basis, has

been within the expected limit - U.S. dollars 72 million,

compared with the expected US dollars 100 million.

The economy responded positively to the reduction of

the SRR as interest rates declined, although the lending rates

declined with a significant time lag. The banks had, among

their liabilities, a considerable share of fixed rate term

deposit liabilities. The impact of releasing of liquidity through this measure was immediately felt on the short-term interest rates, mainly the Treasury bill rate and the prime lending rate. The deposit rates also declined, but remained above the inflation'rate. The banks were also unusually cautious in extending new credit, having experienced a rise in non-performing loans due to the effects of the drought and power cuts on some economic activities in 1996. Credit to the private sector gradually increased and the year ended with an 11.4 per cent credit growth. The money supply increased by 13.8 per cent in 1997, a somewhat lower rate than the targeted 14.5 per cent, but higher than the previous year's comparison of 10.8 per cent. The commercial banks, having experienced a decline in their net foreign assets in the previous year, used a major share of the increased liquidity to rebuild their net foreign asset position. The declining rate of return on domestic financial assets was another reason for this behaviour by commercial banks. ,

Another important development in 1997 was the introduction of a medium-term marketable Treasury bond as a step towards developing a market for medium-term securities. This has become an attractive debt instrument for investors and Rs. 10,000 million worth of bonds were issued in 1997. A much higher volume is expected to be issued in

1998.

The stock market showed some improvement during

1997. The All Share Price Index (ASPI) increased by 16 per

cent in 1997 while the Sensitive Price Index rose by 19 per

cent. There were net inflows of foreign funds of US dollars

13 million through the stock market in 1997.

The fiscal situation improved significantly, primarily

owing to improved cash management. Current expenditure

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

has been contained at 20.7 per cent of GDP in 1997,

compared to 22.8 per cent in 1996, reflecting a reduction in

subsidies, transfers and defence and interest expenditure in

relation to GDP. The high level of privatisation proceeds

enabled the retirement of a part of the public debt and

provided the Government' with flexibility in the management

of its ca'shflow. Total security expenditure declined, as a

percentage of GDP, from 5.8 per cent in 1996 to 5.1 per

cent in 1997. Increases in tax exemptions, reductions in tax

rates and other tax concessions resulted in a reduction in

total revenue to 18.5 per cent of GDP from 19 per cent in

1996. However, mainly due to the strict discipline imposed

on expenditure, including capital expenditure, the overall

budget deficit (without grants and privatisation proceeds) was

reduced to 7.9 per cent of GDP from 9.4 per cent of GDP.

When privatisation proceeds are reckoned as revenue,

however, the deficit declined to 5.3 per cent of GDP

compared to 8.8 per cent in the previous year. The 1998

Budget expects to consolidate the achievements of 1997 and

the overall deficit without grants and privatisation proceeds

is targetted at 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1998, with a medium-

term target of 4 per cent of GDP by the year 2000. Further,

an important development in the last few years has been a

decline in the total public debt in relation to GDP. The stock

of debt declined to 85 per cent in 1997 from 92 per cent in

1996.

On the external front, the growth of exports continued

to be higher than the growth of imports, reflecting the

buoyancy in the tea sector and the dynamism of the

industrial sector. However, there were indications of a slight

slowing down of the growth rate of exports towards the end

of the year, as the deflationary impact of the East Asian

crisis began to be felt on the world economy. Exports grew

Chart 1.1

Income Growth

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

by 13 per cent in 1997 while imports grew by 8 per cent.

The trade deficit as a percentage of GDP declined from 10

per cent in 1996 to 8.0 per cent in 1997. With the

improvement in the services account and higher private

transfers, the current account deficit declined to 2.5 per cent

of GDP from 4.9 per cent in the previous year. The services

account also improved due to increased earnings from

tourism and port services. Earnings from tourism increased

by 25 per cent. Private transfers increased by 11 per cent

in 1997. Net foreign direct investment in 1997 is estimated

at US dollars 129 million. Foreign capital inflows on account

of privatisation amounted to US dollars 301 million. Sri

Lanka also entered the international capital market after

many years, in March 1997, raising US dollars 50 million

through a Floating Rate Notes issue. This was intended to

establish a benchmark interest rate for other potential

borrowers. Overall, the balance of payments showed a large

surplus in 1997. This surplus was reflected in an

accumulation of net foreign assets of commercial banks by

US dollars 200 million and an increase of net official

reserves by US dollars 163 million, the latter being shown

as the overall surplus according to the revised presentation

of the balance of payments.

1.2 Output

Economic Growth

The higher economic growth rate of 6.4 per cent in

1997 reflects not only the recovery of economic activities

from the slump experienced in 1996, but also a significant

improvement in business confidence, mainly due to the

improvement in economic fundamentals. The reduction in

inflation, improved fiscal discipline and the ability to

maintain relatively stable domestic financial markets,

particularly in the context of a highly uncertain international

environment, together with relatively low interest rates,

created a more favourable investment climate. There was a

slight upturn in the stock market and corporate profits

improved considerably during the year. There was also an

increase in the inflow of foreign direct investment, but

inflows from East Asia were below the anticipated levels.

However, inadequate infrastructure facilities and rigidities in

the labour market continued to affect the growth of private

investment. High security expenditure also diverted resources

away from productive investment. As a result, the gross

domestic investment ratio increased marginally from 24.2 per

cent to 24.4 per cent.

GDP at current market prices increased by 15.9 per cent

to Rs. 890,485 million in 1997. With a mid year population

of 18.6 million, this indicated a per capita nominal income

level of Rs. 47,999 (US dollars 814) compared to Rs. 41,940

(US dollars 760) in 1996. When this is adjusted for net

factor income from abroad, the per capita national product

amounted to Rs.47,409 compared to Rs.41,348 in 1996. Sri

Lanka is gradually approaching the income level of a middle

income country. Therefore, its access to concessional foreign

funds for further development work is.likely to diminish

gradually. Hence, in the future, a growing share of foreign

financing for development projects will have to be raised in

foreign capital markets unless domestic savings are raised

substantially.

As in the previous year, the largest contribution to

economic growth came from the Manufacturing sector, which

contributed to 29 per cent of GNP growth in 1997. The

Agriculture sector contributed to 8 per cent or about one

third of the contribution of the Manufacturing sector. The

Mining and quarrying sector contributed 1 per cent, while

the Construction sector contributed 6 per cent. The Services

sector, including utility services, contributed to 55 per cent

of the growth, reflecting mainly the high growth in

electricity, ports, trading and financial services. It is not

unusual for the Services sector to be the major sector of a

•growing economy-. However, there is-scope for further strong

development in the Manufacturing and Services sectors in Sri

Lanka.'

Agriculture

The Agriculture sector grew by 3 per cent. This mainly reflected the buoyancy of the tea sector due to improved performance of tea plantations under private management and attractive tea prices. The recovery of the paddy sector from the drought affected output level in 1996 also made a significant contribution. Further, agricultural activities in the Northern Province returned to near normalcy. The partial reopening of fishing areas in the North and East and the growth of inland fisheries also made a positive contribution to economic growth.

The tea sector continued to enjoy attractive prices in

international markets. Tea prices at the Colombo auctions

increased by 15 per cent, after a 44 per cent increase in

1996. Tea production increased by 7 per cent over the

previous year's peak output to reach 277 million kg. The

high and mid elevations registered their highest output levels

after 1971 and 1981, respectively. As a result of the

attractive prices, production had commenced even on

marginal tea smallholdings. The average yields in plantations

increased by 7 per cent to 1,465 kg. per hectare and in

smallholdings by 2 per cent to 1.972 kg. per hectare. The

cost of production increased by 4 per cent, compared to 14

per cent in 1996. The relatively low yield in the plantations

is attributed to the long years of neglect after land reform.

There are clear signs of improvement in this sector under

private management. Profitability in the tea sector increased

further owing to attractive prices, higher yields and the slow

increase in the cost of production.

Coconut production showed a moderate growth of 3

per cent, recovering partly from the impact of the 1996

drought. Although there was a tight supply situation in the

first few months of the year, the higher production during

the second and third quarters of the year eased this situation.

The fragmentation of coconut land as a result of the

increased demand from the growing industrial sector and

housing and development projects continued in 1997. The

coconut yields per hectare increased marginally. The cost of

production of coconut increased by 4 per cent. While export

4

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

prices increased marginally in rupee terms, the average

domestic price of fresh nuts increased sharply by 26 per cent

in 1997. Coconut oil prices declined sharply due to improved

supply and increased availability of oil substitutes both

internationally and locally. The price declines were also

partly attributed to the East Asian currency crisis.

Rubber production declined by 6 per cent mainly

because of the decline in prices, which affected the

profitability of the sector. There were also labour shortages

as the producers were unable to pay competitive wages.

Moreover, heavy and unseasonal rains in late. 1997 prevented

rubber tapping. The average cost of production increased by

10 per cent, Colombo auction prices declined by 17 per cent.

The yield declined by 11 per cent; The profitability of the

sector declined considerably in 1997.

Paddy production increased by 9 per cent with an

improvement in the yield. The other agricultural crops

showed a mixed performance: Production of pepper, cloves,

cinnamon quills and citronella is estimated to have increased

in 1997. Among subsidiary food crops, big onions, sesame,

ground nuts and red onions showed higher output levels.

However, chillie and potato production declined after the

removal of licensing restrictions in 1996 which led to

cheaper imports, reflecting lower productivity in Sri Lanka.

Mining and Quarrying

This sector grew by 3.4 per cent in 1997 reflecting the

growth of quarrying products, bricks and tiles as a result of

the growth in construction activities. This growth rate was

lower than in 1996. as there was a slowing down of the

export demand for gems and semi precious stones during the

second half of the year due to the drop in demand from

Japan and other countries following the East Asian financial

turmoil. Despite a volume decline, export earnings from

minerals (ilmenite, graphite etc.) remained at US dollars 90

million, as in 1996.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing output increased by 10.3 per cent during 1997. The textiles and garments sector grew by 19 per cent, raising its share in GDP from 4.5 per cent in 1996 to 5.1 per cent in 1997. During the last four years, the textiles and garments sector accounted for 38 per cent of the industrial sector output. This share increased to 41 per cent in 1997, indicating an increasing reliance on this sector. Evidently, Sri Lanka has established a strong presence in the international garments industry on account of high quality, efficiency and timely supply. It is noteworthy that 30 per cent of the exports were to countries outside the quota system.

Meanwhile, the production of many other industrial

items, such as plastics, paints, milk products, processed tea,

beverages, sweets, meat products, electrical items, batteries and rubber products also showed high growth rates. The growth rates of these items ranged from 5 to 28 per cent.

Based on the Central Bank's Annual Industrial

Production Survey of 470 firms, industrial sector capacity

was estimated to have increased by 5 per cent in 1997, in

line with the growth of overall private investment. The

Survey also revealed a 2.9 per cent increase in labour

productivity. The Manufacturing sector profitability ratio

increased to 15.6 per cent from 14.9 in 1996.

The coverage of industries for incentives, mainly in the

form of tax and import duty concessions, has been expanding

over the last three years to encourage investment. The

demand for Sri Lanka's industrial products, mainly for

apparel and textiles from western industrial countries,

continued to increase. The reduction of the statutory reserve

requirements by the Central Bank in early 1997, the new

foreign currency loan scheme to non-BOI exporters and a

reduction of the crowding out of resources by the

Government in 1997 helped to reduce interest rates, though

not as much as expected by industrialists. These, together

with the moderate depreciation of the rupee against major

currencies, helped the industrial sector.

The supply of credit to the industrial sector improved

in 1997. The two major development banks and commercial

banks continued to provide financing facilities to the

industrial sector in the form of direct loans and equity

participation. The National Development Bank (NDB) and

5

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC)

Bank approved Rs.15,575 million in 1997 as against

Rs.10,844 million in 1996. Commercial bank advances to the

industrial sector during the first nine months increased

marginally to Rs.25,400 million.

The Government's industrial policy continued to place

emphasis on private sector led industrialisation, as announced

in 1994. The industrial policy aims at expansion,

diversification and upgrading of the industrial base, efficient

management of physical and manpower resources,

employment generation and raising of income levels, export

promotion and regionalising of industries.

Exports of industrial products increased by 14.3 per cent

in 1997, with exports of textiles and garments increasing by

20 per cent. Employment in the Manufacturing sector

increased by 4 per cent. With the encouragement and

growth of manufacturing and investment activities, the

imports of intermediate and investment goods also increased

during the year.

Services

The Services sector continued to grow steadily.

Electricity, telecommunication, trading activities, port services

and tourism showed improved performance. In the power

sector, the addition of 177 MW of thermal power capacity

raised the power-generating capacity of the national grid for

the first time after five years, reducing the reliance on hydro

power from 81 to 71 per cent and thus improving the

reliability of supply. In addition, the first private sector

BOO power project, with a capacity of 22.5 MW, was begun

by Lakdhanavi Pvt. Ltd. Total electricity generation by all

duty waivers for selected consumer goods also helped to

contain inflation. The favourable impact of the above factors

on inflation was somewhat offset by the increase in

administered prices of wheat flour and the consequent rise

in bread prices in August, the upward revision of electricity

tariffs in September and increases in cigarette prices in June

1997. The depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee by about 7

per cent against the US dollar also contributed to inflation.

All available aggregate price indicators showed a substantial deceleration in inflation. The year on year increase in consumer prices, as reflected in the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), was 9.6 per cent in 1997. The Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index (GCPI), which has a wider coverage, indicated a faster decline in consumer price increases, from 14.7 per cent in 1996 to 7.1 per cent in 1997. A provisional price indicator prepared by the Central Bank, using data from the first round of the 1996/ 97 Consumer Finance Survey, indicated a consumer price inflation of 7.3 per cent in 1997. The Wholesale Price Index, which reflects the trends in all prices at the primary market level, showed a 6.9 per cent inflation compared to 20.5 per cent in 1996. The Gross Domestic Product Deflator, which is an implicit price indicator for the whole range of goods and services produced in the country, increased by 8.5 per cent in 1997, compared to 12.2 per cent in 1996.

1.5 Wages

Wage determination in the organised sector is based on

mechanisms established by statute or on mechanisms which

have evolved over the years. In the case of the public and

local government sector, sometimes Pay Review

Commissions are appointed and wage adjustments are made

according to Cabinet decisions. In the organised private

sector, wage adjustments are made on decisions of Wages

Boards and Remunerative Tribunals, which are binding on

the semi-government and co-operative sectors. In addition,

in the organised private sector, wages, are based on

arbitration and conciliation procedures, collective bargaining,

individual bargaining and unilateral employer decisions. In

the unorganised private sector, wage determination is based

on individual bargaining and unilateral employer decisions.

In 1997, the Government took the first step in a major

overhaul of public sector salaries by accepting the

recommendations of the Salaries Review Committee

appointed in 1994 with Mr. B.C.Perera as Chairman. This

was the first comprehensive review of public sector

emoluments in more than 20 years. Accordingly, the

proposed new salary scales entailed a unification of base

wages and allowances. The first stage of the salary increase

of 40 per cent of the proposed increase, subject to a

minimum of Rs.325 per month, was granted from 1 January 1997. The balance increase, for those in the higher end of the salary structure, which was to be effective from 1 January 1998, has been deferred until July 1998. Many public sector employees, except school teachers who received substantial wage increases in 1995, received significant nominal wage increases under these proposals. As a result, the Wage Rate Index of government employees increased by 10.8 per cent in 1997 compared to 3.2 per cent in 1996. Government school teachers received a modest nominal wage increase of 2.4 per cent in 1997. Correction of certain anomalies in the salary scales of government school teachers was under consideration.

In the organised private sector, minimum wages applicable to several wages boards were revised upwards by 5.9 per cent following an increase of 8.3 per cent in 1996. Minimum daily wages of workers in the tea sector have remained at Rs.83 since August 1996. The wage rate in rubber plantations reached Rs.83.22 by October 1997 with wage increases in line with the cost of living index, and was frozen at the level of 83 from November.. In the.unorganised sector, provisional data revealed that nominal wages had increased significantly, by 9-19 per cent, for most activities, such as building construction, paddy, tea and coconut cultivation.

Overall, given an average consumer price increase of

around 9.6 per cent, real wages increased significantly in

1997.

1.6 Population

According to the Registrar General's Department, the

mid year population in 1997 is estimated to be 18.6 million,

compared to 18.3 million in 1996. The addition of nearly

237,000 persons to the population during the year resulted

in raising the density of population from 292 persons per

square kilometer in 1996 to 296 persons in 1997. Despite

the slow growth compared to the past, the addition to the

8

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

sources increased by 13 per cent with the value addition

increasing by 8 per cent compared to the 2 per cent decline

in 1996.

The telecommunication sector continued to expand with

increased participation by the private sector and a higher

level of performance by Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd. Several new

suppliers entered the telecommunication sector, adding to the

competition. A 35 per cent share of Sri Lanka Telecom was

sold to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Coiporation (NTT)

of Japan for US dollars 225 million. The number of

telephone subscribers increased by 72,453 to 315,241 in

1997. There were 24 licensed private sector companies

providing various telecommunication services at end 1997.

adding 2 more to the total. The share of the private sector

in telecommunication services is growing rapidly. The

telecommunication sector grew by 33 per cent in 1997

compared to 25 per cent in 1996.

The share of port services continued to grow, reflecting the growth of Sri Lanka's import and export trade and an increase in transshipment cargo handled. The profitability of port services increased, by 13 per cent in 1997 with a 22 per cent increase in total revenue.

Among other services, the tourism sector recovered

sharply by about 22 per cent in 1997. Reflecting the growth

in most other sectors, the trading sector grew by 6.5 per cent

compared with 5.2 per cent in 1996.

1.3 Investment and Savings

The country's investment rate increased marginally to

24.4 per cent of GDP. The relatively slow growth in

investment was mainly due to the decline in public

investment largely reflecting the resource constraints faced

by the Government. Private investment increased further to

18.9 per cent from 18 per cent in 1996. However, this

sluggish growth of investment needs to be noted seriously.

With this level of investment the prospects for faster growth

in the medium-term remain bleak, if the impediments to

private investment are not removed early.

The developments regarding savings are encouraging.

With the faster growth in real incomes, the domestic savings

rate increased to 17.3 per cent of GDP from 15.3 per cent

in 1996. This indicates an improvement in the marginal

propensity to save despite a reduction in the real interest

rates. This also partly reflects the decline in Government dis­

savings, mainly through the rationalisation of public spending

in 1997, and increased corporate savings. The country could

have maintained a higher level of investment with this level

of savings, allowing for a somewhat higher external current

account deficit. However, this did not happen as there were

other factors inhibiting the growth of private investment,

which need to be addressed early.

1.4 Prices

The inflation rate decelerated sharply in 1997 mainly

due to the improvement of the domestic supply situation and

a reduction in the demand pressure as a result of the

moderation of monetary expansion. In addition to the

improvement in the domestic supply of food commodities,

the availability of imported consumer goods also improved

after the removal of licensing requirements on the imports

of onions, potatoes and chillies. The granting of temporary

population has created major problems such as high

unemployment, high population density and land

fragmentation. Long-term population projections indicate

several noteworthy features that are likely to emerge over

the next few decades. These are the ageing of the population,

a rising dependency ratio and a possible tightening of the

labour market in the first decade of the next century. Among

these, the ageing of the population and related economic and

social policy issues need immediate attention.

The decline in fertility rates, along with the

improvement in life expectancy, has led to a faster increase

in the older age groups than in the younger age groups over

the past few decades. The old age dependency ratio reflected

a significant increase from 5.9 per cent in 1946 to 7.4 per

cent in 1997. It is projected that this rate will be as much

as 17.4 per cent by 2021.

Chart 1.6 Unemployment Sate

1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 Year

The ageing of the population will have a number of diverse effects on the labour force, education, health and other social welfare programmes. Additional resources will be required to meet the basic needs of the aged. The number of youth entering the labour force will peak before 2020 and will fall thereafter. Meanwhile, the future rate of growth of the labour force is expected to decline significantly and reach a steady state of zero growth from the year 2010 onwards. As a consequence, the problem of labour scarcity is likely to emerge in the first decade of the next century. This change in the labour market and the immediate problem of absorbing those who are currently unemployed into productive employment need to be given due consideration in the design of economic policies for the next twenty five years. In the short run there is an urgent need to promote investment, particularly in the private sector, for the economy to be able to provide productive employment to the currently unemployed labour force. Labour market policies are complementary to investment promotion policies, as making the labour market more flexible and the labour force more productive and easily adaptable to industry demands would

encourage private investment. This would help to accelerate economic growth and employment generation. This would also provide an opportunity for some of the retirees after the compulsory retirement age to be actively engaged in economic activity. The education and training systems would also need to be reoriented towards promoting new skills to keep pace with technological developments.

A gradual deceleration in the unemployment rate was

observed during the 1990s. Expansion of informal sector

activities, creation of new job opportunities in the fields of

computer services, electronic media and financial services

and a continuation of high migration for foreign employment

appeared to be the major contributory factors to the decline

in unemployment. However, youth unemployment still

remains high. A continuation of high unemployment, while

some economic sectors experienced labour shortages, has

been another special feature in the Sri Lanka labour market.

Therefore, a major challenge ahead is to reduce

unemployment by reformulating the education system so as

to match the growing labour force to the changing needs of

the economy, particularly the needs of the private sector.

1.7 Fiscal Policy and Budgetary Operations

In 1997 budgetary policies were formulated with the

objective of making further progress towards firm fiscal'

consolidation. The primary emphasis was placed on reducing

the fiscal deficit in 1,997, while correcting existing

weaknesses in fiscal management, with a firm commitment

to the continuation of the privatisation programme.

Accordingly, several improvements were expected. They

were, cleaning of public accounts, rationalisation of off-

budget transactions, strengthening of financial controls and

accountability, improving of revenues, reduction of wasteful

expenditure, elimination of corruption and consolidation of

social expenditure. The budget deficit was expected to be

financed through non-inflationary sources. Considerable

progress was made in 1997. The growth of expenditure was

contained and the privatisation programme proceeded

successfully. The overall fiscal deficit, without grants and

privatisation proceeds, was reduced to 7.9 per cent of GDP

in 1997, from 9.4 per cent in 1996. This enabled a net

reduction in debt to the banking system with a larger

reduction in government debt to the Central Bank. These

achievements, together with a cautious monetary policy

adopted in 1997, helped to maintain domestic financial

markets relatively stable in a highly unstable global

environment. The 1998 Budget was presented; within a

relatively favourable macroeconomic environment, with a

view to further strengthening these achievements and

accelerating economic development.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Box 1

Inflation-Unemployment Trade-Off and Misery Index

The relationship between (he wage inflation rate and unemployment rate, popularly known as the 'Phillips Curve*, was first introduced by A. W. Phillips in 1958'. He studied a century of British data and concluded that the two variables show a systematic inverse relationship, in other words, that there is a trade-off between wage inflation and unemployment. In the 1960s, two American economists. Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow. showed that the inverse relationship exists for U.S. data too..Hence, at that time, policymakers thought they had two clear alternative intermediate targets: if the unemployment rate is targctted, it also implies an automatic targetting of the inflation rate, and vice versa.

Over time, more data on inflation and unemployment were obtained and by the early 1970s, economists felt that the 'Phillips Curve* relationship could not be supported in the long-run. Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps (1969, 1972) came out with the proposition that there is no trade off between inflation and unemployment, and that in the long-run. an economy moves towards a long-run equilibrium of full employment, a 'natural rate of unemployment', irrespective of the rates of change of prices and wages.*

The applicability of these theories to the Sri Lankan ease is a matter of considerable interest. However, a facile application of the theory is faced with some problems. Many long-run macroeconomic trends of the Sri Lankan economy are yet to be fully explored. For example, it is not yet ascertained whether the economy is moving towards or moving around a long-run equilibrium path. It is also not clear whether the concept of a 'natural rate of unemployment' is relevant in a developing economy such as Sri Lanka where labour market participation and composition are changing tovvards the manufacturing and services sectors with the structural changes in the economy.

However, a desired goal for the rate of unemployment can be set at around 5-6 per cent for the next decade. The economy appears to be moving towards a long-run equilibrium low rate of unemployment. The remaining structural impediments mentioned elsewhere need to be eliminated for this trend to be sustained. On inflation, the Monetary Law Act indicates a month over month annual inflation rate of 10 per cent as the upper limit of the desirable rate. This is consistent with many economists' perceptions of a single digit inflation rate desirable for all economies. In the case of Sri Lanka, inflation rate.s of 4-5 per cent should be the medium-term target. Despite the

theoretical incpnclusiveness of the relationship, governments in most countries now prefer fairly low rales of unemployment and inflation. Given the current level of unemployment of 10-11 per cent in Sri Lanka, lower unemployment with lower inflation is feasible.

Table 1 and Chart I show a very volatile inflation rate (measured by the percentage change of the annual average Colombo Consumers* Price Index) and a comparatively less volatile unemployment rate (measured by unemployed persons as a percentage of the labour force). In the early sixties, there seemed to have been a trade-off between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate. The adoption of a fixed exchange rate policy, price controls and subsidies and other inward looking policies led to suppressed inflation and high unemployment. After the early 1980s, the trade-off is less pronounced. The period after the early 1990s has seen no trade-off between unemployment and inflation, and in fact, the relationship was positive. The unemployment rate was declining with a declining inflation rate, except in 1996. when the inflation rate surged largely due to the effect of a severe drought (Chart 1). The estimated overall' relationship for the period 1963-1997 (excluding three extreme outlier data points), using a semi-log regression, shows a significant negative relationship (Chart 2).

The overall budget deficit, after grants and privatisation proceeds, was brought down to 4,5 per cent of GDP, which was a 3.3 percentage point reduction compared to a deficit of 7.8 per cent in 1996. Compared to the original Budget

target, the overall deficit in 1997 was lower by 1.6 per cent

of GDP. This improvement was mainly the outcome of the

larger than expected receipts from privatisation (Rs.22.535

cash management with strict control over unproductive,

wasteful expenditure and supplementary expenditure, and

interest savings due to retirement of high cost debt. The

upward adjustment of wheat flour prices by 12 per cent from

Rs.16.95 per kg. to Rs.18.95 per kg. in line with

international price trends also contributed to containing the

growth of recurrent expenditure in 1997. However, project

implementation delays, particularly in port development,

power, energy and telecommunication, resulted in a shortfall

in capital expenditure and affected the utilisation of foreign

aid.

In 1997, both current and capital expenditure as a

percentage of GDP declined. It is noteworthy that security

expenditure declined from 6.4 per cent of GDP in 1995 to

5.8 per cent in 1996 and further to 5.1 per cent in 1997.

The non-defence salaries and wages also declined marginally

in 1997 to 3.1 per cent of GDP from 3.3 per cent.

The use of domestic resources by the Government to

finance the deficit was significantly lower in 1997, indicating

a reduction in the crowding out impact. The proceeds of the

Floating Rate Notes (FRN) issue, amounting to US dollars

50 million, were also available to the Government. Part of

the privatisation proceeds were used to retire high cost public

debt and a commitment was made to reduce the statutory

limit of Treasury bills from Rs.125 billion to Rs.l 15 billion.

The 199$ Budget expects to make further progress in

privatisation and to use such divestiture proceeds for further

retirement of public debt.

Reflecting the retirement of debt, Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank declined from Rs.17,100 million at end 1996 to Rs.7,222 million at end 1997. Part of the privatisation proceeds was also placed in a special deposit with the Central Bank. The outcome was a reduction in net credit to government from the Central Bank by Rs.l3,991 million. However, net credit to government by the entire banking system declined by Rs.2,172 million as commercial bank holdings of Treasury bills increased after the reduction of the SRR. In addition, the Government's stock of administrative borrowings was reduced by Rs.6,654 million in 1996 to Rs.4,584 million in 1997. The 1998 Budget has targetted an overall deficit of 6.5 per cent of GDP (before grants and privatisation). This deficit is expected to be reduced to 4 per cent of GDP by the year 2000.

1.8 Public Enterprise Reforms

The public enterprise reform programme generated

Rs.22,535 million, contributing to 11.5 per cent of total

receipts of the Government in 1997, enabling the

Government to retire part of the public debt and restructure

its debt portfolio.. This helped to reduce the interest cost, but

the full effect on interest cost will be felt in 1998 and

beyond.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

A major step forward in the public enterprise reform

programme was the. sale of a 35 per cent stake in Sri Lanka

Telecom Limited to'NTT of Japan for Rs. 13,274 million (US

dollars 225 million). The accompanying management contract

with NTT was another vital step towards improving the

operational efficiency of Sri Lanka Telecom. The

Government also earmarked 3.5 per cent of the shares of Sri

Lanka Telecom for its employees.

The sale of convertible debentures of the NDB held by

the Government generated Rs.4,500 million. The transaction

was the largest single public offering made through the

Colombo Stock Exchange. Convertible debentures of the

NDB amounting to Rs.275 million, which had been issued,

to the Government in January 1993, were divested. The

convertible debentures, which were to mature in 1999, 2000

and 2001 were converted into 18.33 million ordinary shares

at a par value of Rs.10 per share and offered to the market

through the Colombo Stock Exchange. As the issue was too

large to be absorbed by the domestic market, 16.5 million

shares were offered abroad, while 916,667 shares were

offered to domestic investors. The remaining 916,666 shares

were purchased by the NDB for its Employee Stock

Ownership Plan. The international issue was priced at Rs.260

per share and the domestic issue was priced at Rs.250 per

share.

The divestiture of 51 per cent of shares of each of

seven plantation companies (Namunukula Plantations

Limited, Maturata Plantations Limited, Malwatte Valley

Plantations Limited, Kahawatte Plantations Limited, Elpitiya

Plantations Limited, Talawakelle Plantations Limited, and

Pussellawa Plantations Limited), was completed. Proceeds

realised from this amounted to Rs.2,914 million. Public share

issues for the divestiture of 19 per cent of each of five

plantation companies, namely, Bogawantalawa Plantations

Limited, Kegalle Plantations Limited, Agalawatte Plantations

Limited, Horana Plantations Limited and Kelani Valley

Plantations Limited, contributed Rs.635 million to

government revenue in 1997.

The sale of 90 per cent of shares of Larika Salt Limited

and Puttalam Salt Limited generated Rs. 575 million, while

the public share issue of 17.33 per cent of shares of Lanka

Ceramic Limited generated Rs. 206 million in 1997.

Mattegama Textile Mill Limited, which was re-acquired •

by the Government as a failed privatised public enterprise,

was restructured and rehabilitated. This was re-divested

through the sale of the entire ownership-for Rs.29.5 million

to Kabool Lanka Ltd.

1.9 Government Debt and Debt Service Payments

Government debt at the end of 1997 stood at

Rs.758,714 million, recording an increase of 7 per cent. The

total debt/GDP ratio declined to 85 per cent in 1997

compared to 92 per cent in 1996. This is a favourable trend

observed since 1993. The total domestic debt accounted for

50 per cent of the total government debt.

The debt structure improved significantly with the issue

of Treasury bonds, issue of Rupee Loans with options for

early retirement, and a reduction in the level of short-term

debt. This made the debt structure more flexible and yield

determination more market oriented. Of the total domestic

debt, the share of short-term debt declined to 35 per cent at

the end of 1997 from 41 per cent at the end of 1996.

Treasury bills accounted for 86 per cent of the short-term

debt. Medium and long-term debt (including long-term

restructuring bonds) increased by 21 per cent and accounted

for.65 per cent of the total domestic debt in 1997. Treasury

bonds accounted for 4 per cent'of the total outstanding

medium and long-term debt. The debt profile is likely to

improve further in 1998 towards more medium-term and

long-term debt instruments with more Treasury bonds being

issued to the market and the Treasury bill limit being frozen

at Rs.l 15,000 million.

The outstanding foreign debt increased by 5 per cent

to Rs.375,752 million at the end of 1997. Of this increase,

Rs.l,959 million was due to exchange rate variations. The

share of concessional debt in total foreign debt stock stood

at 96 per cent at the end of 1997.

The debt service payments of the Government

increased by 14 per cent to Rs.92,519 million. The interest

component accounted for 60 per cent of total debt service

payments. Interest payments also accounted for 30 per cent

of current expenditure and absorbed 34 per cent of

government revenue.

1.10 International Environment and External Sector Developments

International Economic Environment

The year witnessed one of the most disturbing events

in the international economic environment in recent years.

The East Asian currency crisis that erupted in July 1997 and

continued through the end of the year had far reaching

economic and financial implications on the global economy.

The world economy grew by 4.1 per cent in 1997, the same

rate as in 1996. This was below the 4.3 per cent growth

anticipated at the beginning of the year. This was due to the

slowing down of the growth rate of developing countries

from 6.6 per cent in 1996 to 5.8 per cent in 1997. Yet, Asia

with an estimated 6.7 per cent economic growth, continued

to be the mainstay in world output growth. Robust

economies in the United States, the United Kingdom and

Canada, improved performances in the rest of Europe, and

a turnaround in countries in transition, underpinned the

expansion in world output. A significant slowing down of

the economic growth in Japan from 3.9 per cent to 0.9 per

cent, a slide in the growth of newly industrialised Asian

countries to 6.1 per cent from 6.4 per cent in 1996, and a

notable decline of the growth in emerging East Asian

countries (ASEAN-4 i.e. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines

and Thailand) from 7.1 per cent to 3.9 per cent were

observed. Commitments by governments to price stability

were manifested by the subdued global inflationary pressures.

The global macroeconomic environment prior to the

East Asian turmoil was conducive to economic growth. .With

strong commitments to price stability, world inflation

remained favourable and at its lowest levels for the past

quarter century. While the inflation rate in advanced

economies declined further to 2.1 per cent from 2.4 per cent

in. 1996, that of developing countries dropped from 13.7 per

cent to 8.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the inflation rate in

countries in transition registered a notable decline from 41

per cent to 28 per cent. Interest rates tended to decline in

many countries. World trade on the other hand, registered a

growth of 9.4 per cent in 1997 against 6.6 per cent in the

previous year, the major impetus coming from advanced and

developing countries.

With the increased supply conditions, international

prices of major commodities declined during the year. In

particular, fuel prices declined sharply towards the end of

the year as a result of higher supply. Sugar, wheat and rice

prices declined by 14 per cent each during the year due to

improved world supply conditions. International rubber prices

continued to decline due to the increased global supply and

the release of buffer stocks by the United States. Rubber

prices were also hard hit towards the end of the year as a

result of the currency turmoil in East Asia which accounted

for over 85 per cent of world exports of rubber. International

prices of coconut products, which increased during the early

part of the year declined towards the end of the year as a

result of improved supply conditions as well as the East

Asian crisis which had a notable impact on the Philippines,

the world largest exporter of coconut products. In contrast,

tea prices remained buoyant throughout the year as a result

of supply shortages, caused mainly by a drought in Kenya.

Strong demand for tea from the Middle East and the

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) also provided a

strong stimulus for tea prices.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

The most notable events of 1997 occurred in the

'exchange markets and began in Thailand with a speculative

attack on the baht. While the baht depreciated by about 46

per cent against the US dollar, the Indonesian Rupiah and

the Korean Won depreciated by 57 per cent and 50 per cent,

respectively. The Malaysian ringgit and the Philippines peso

depreciated by 35 per cent each against the US dollar. With

strong economic performance, the US dollar strengthened

against almost all major currencies. Financial market

uncertainties and a weak economy caused the Japanese yen

to weaken by about 11 per cent against the dollar. The

Deutsche mark also reflected a correction during the year.

Against the backdrop of these developments, short term

interest rates in the global market, which remained relatively

high up to mid 1997, tended to decline towards the end of

the year. Meanwhile, long-term interest rates continued to

drop as commitments by governments to make progress

towards price stability strengthened. For example, 6-month

LIBOR, which was at 5.93 per cent per annum at end May

1997 declined to 5.84 per cent by the end of the year, while

the 30-year US Treasury bond rate declined from 6.30 per

cent in December 1996 to 5.81 per cent in December 1997.

The developing countries continued with structural

reforms particularly in the areas of trade liberalisation and

addressing macroeconomic issues. The International Monetary

Fund (IMF) was heavily involved as a crisis manager in East

Asia. It also took initiatives to ificrease its quota with a view

to increasing its liquidity, thereby, inter-alia, facilitating

financing arrangements of such reforms. The debate on

capital account liberalisation received renewed interest in

1997. The developing countries emphasized the importance

of orderly and gradual liberalization of the capital account

depending on the circumstances of each country. They, also

urged that there should be an equitable sharing of costs of

post-crisis financial stabilisation among private creditors,

borrowers and governments. The IMF, while highlighting the

positive role of capital flows in the economic progress in

Asian countries before the crisis, was also of the view that

capital account liberalisation has to be orderly and properly

sequenced.

The contagion effect of the crisis on other countries was

felt with a dramatic change in the sentiment of both domestic

and foreign investors who attempted to protect themselves

against the adverse effects of an imminent deterioration of

the value of the local currencies.

Several key domestic and external factors triggered the crisis in East Asia and its contagion and spillover effects. The domestic factors that triggered the crisis are the overheating of the economies, which was reflected in large external current account deficits and inflated property and stock market prices; exchange rate overvaluation due to the

maintenance of pegged exchange rates over a long period;

excessive foreign exposure of both financial and corporate

sectors; sharp deterioration in the quality of loan portfolios

of the financial institutions due to weak management and

poor control of risks, lax enforcement of prudential

regulations, weak supervision, and government directed

lending; lack of transparency; and problems of general and

corporate governance including political instability. Among

the external factors, the most important were the heavy

injection of funds into those emerging economies in search

of higher returns by international investors who had

underestimated the associated risks; large exchange rate

swings among key currencies and losses of international

competitiveness which led to substantial slowing down of

exports; and behaviour of hedge funds who were seeking to

hedge their foreign exposure through forward booking in the

context of the imminent crisis.

The evolution of the European Monetary Union (EMU),

which is scheduled to be in place at the beginning of 1999

would also constitute a major change in the international

monetary system. Meanwhile, the time for submission of

commitments on' financial services for negotiations under the

World Trade Organisation (WTO) expired at the end of the

year. Sri Lanka also submitted its offers on financial services

in 1997 (Box 9).

External Sector Developments

The balance of payments position improved significantly

in 1997, mainly reflecting increased exports, services

receipts, private transfers and higher capital inflows. Exports

grew faster than imports thereby narrowing the trade deficit

considerably. The services account registered a larger surplus

mainly due to the growth of tourism and port services. Net

outflow on account of investment income declined due to

increased interest earnings. There were higher capital inflows

both in terms of privatisation proceeds and foreign direct

investment reflecting an improvement in investor confidence.

A lower trade deficit, a significantly lower current account

deficit, a respectable surplus in the overall balance and a

relatively stable foreign exchange market were the highlights

of the external sector developments in 1997.

On the external policy front, the managed floating

exchange, rate regime was maintained, allowing the currency

to move within the band of 2 per cent between the Central

Bank's buying and selling rates, gradually keeping in mind

the need to minimise erratic movements in the exchange rate.

The annual average real effective exchange rate showed

some appreciation in 1997 reflecting the sharp depreciation

of East Asian currencies during the second half of 1997.

This indicator alone may not reveal the complete picture with

regard to the external competitiveness of Sri Lankan

products, particularly given the inflationary impact of the large depreciation of East Asian currencies, and the credit crunch experienced by East Asian countries. However, some adverse effects of the East Asian currency and financial market crisis cannot be.totally ruled out, as some of these countries are likely to put their houses in order with lower real wages and controlled inflationary pressures. While it will take some time for this process to go through its full cycle, export demand is likely to contract somewhat due to the contraction of their domestic demand as well as the demand in the rest of the world due to slow growth in real incomes. This could be reflected in the volume as well as unit prices of exports.

The resilience displayed by the external sector in the

previous year amidst difficult conditions was strengthened in

1997, with a rapid recovery in the economy. Exports

increased by 13 per cent while imports grew by 8 per cent.

As a result, the trade deficit narrowed, for the third

consecutive year from 10 per cent of GDP in 1996 to 8 per

cent in 1997. The net service receipts increased by 51 per

cent due to a strong recovery in the tourist industry and

expansion of port related activities. Net factor income

outflows declined by US dollars 38 million as there were

higher inflows on account of interest earnings in respect of

external assets invested abroad. Net private transfers

increased by 11 per cent due to higher receipts on account

of compensation payments to Sri Lankan workers who were

displaced from Kuwait by the Gulf war in 1990. The current

account deficit of the balance of payments declined sharply

to 2.5 per cent of GDP in 1997 or US dollars 387 million

from 4.9 per cent of GDP or US dollars 683 million in 1996

continuing its downward trend for the third consecutive year.

Net long-term private capital inflows increased

substantially from US dollars 123 million to US dollars 491

million due mainly to privatisation proceeds. Foreign funds

received by the NDB for its lending activities and the foreign

sale of NDB shares and 35 per cent of the shares of Sri

Lanka Telecom, totalling US dollars 376 million, were the

major sources of foreign private capital inflows to the

country in 1997. Despite an increase in short-term trade

credits of the private sector, net short-term liabilities declined

as there was an increase in the net external assets of

commercial banks in the context of declining domestic

interest rates. The Government successfully raised US dollars

50 million through a FRN issue in the international capital

market after 15 years. However, net official capital inflows

declined by about 35 per cent during the year due to weak

utilisation of foreign aid. Net capital transfers too declined

by 29 per cent due to a reduction in project grants.

According to the new BPM5 presentation format, the overall

balance of the balance of payments registered a healthy

surplus of US dollars 163 million during 1997. Gross official

external assets at US dollars 2,029 million were sufficient

to finance 3.9 months of imports projected for 1998,

compared to 4.0 months import cover at end 1996.

Meanwhile, total assets, including those of commercial banks,

had risen to 5.4 months of import cover from 5.0 months

at end 1996.

1.11 Financial Sector

There were two major challenges in the conduct of

monetary policy in 1997. First, the economic recovery

process had to be supported without disturbing the declining

trend in inflation, while maintaining a proper balance

between the money market and foreign exchange market.

Second, in the context of the East Asian currency turmoil,

the domestic financial system had to be guarded against

speculative attacks to ensure stability. Accordingly, there was

some relaxation of the tightness of monetary policy at the

beginning of the year to support an orderly reduction in

interest rates and a slight tightening towards the end of the

year, to preserve stability in the domestic financial market.

Towards the end of 1996, the economy was gradually recovering from the setback due to the drought. The rate of monetary expansion had decelerated and inflationary pressures were abating, as economic activities recovered. Government borrowing from the banking system was reduced as fiscal management improved and the deficit was narrowed. However, credit growth to the private sector was slow and some liquidity constraints were being observed in the market.

The tightness of monetary policy was relaxed somewhat in early 1997 by reducing the SRR. The SRR on rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks was reduced from 15 per cent to 14 per cent in January 1997. The SRR on foreign currency deposits placed abroad, which stood at 5 per cent, was also abolished, while maintaining the SRR on foreign currency deposits lent domestically at 15 per cent. Subsequently, in March 1997, the SRR on all deposit liabilities was reduced to 12 per cent, excluding the foreign currency deposits placed abroad. The SRR on foreign currency deposits placed abroad was maintained at the zero level.

Following the announcement made in the 1997 Budget, commercial banks were permitted to provide foreign currency loans to non-BOI exporters either from their domestic units or from their foreign currency banking units (FCBUs). This was also considered a further liberalisation of the external capital account. However, in providing this facility, due precaution was taken by placing specific limits on net foreign liabilities of commercial banks, at 15 per cent of capital funds. The conversion of domestic currency to repay these loans was not permitted, requiring borrowers to repay only in foreign currency.

The reductions in the SRR were designed to provide an immediate injection of liquidity into the system by releasing around Rs.8,000 million of reserve money held by the Central Bank, to the commercial banks. The consequent increase in the money multiplier would then create the potential for commercial banks to increase their credit levels ultimately by about Rs.20,000-Rs.25.000 million which would help boost credit to the private sector and support the recovery of the economy. In addition, the reduction in the SRR would reduce the effective cost of funds of commercial banks, thus enabling them to reduce their lending rates. This measure also represented a further step in the Central Bank's move away from the use of direct controls to the use of more market oriented instruments in the implementation of monetary policy. The provision of foreign currency loans to non-BOI exporters was designed to increase liquidity in the market and to enable them to obtain credit at relatively low. rates.

17

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

The funds released by the reductions in the SRR were initially invested in Treasury bills through purchases from the secondary window of the Central Bank. The funds moved back into the credit operations of the commercial banks. Commercial banks also reduced their lending rates somewhat on many of their loan schemes reflecting the impact of the reduction in the SRR on their cost of funds. However, as has been observed by many economists, while increases in SRR are effective in reducing credit, if there is no excess liquidity, reductions in SRR do not necessarily lead to corresponding increases in credit unless there is additional demand for credit. Thus, due to caution on the part of both borrowers and lenders, the realised credit expansion consequent on the reduction in SRR was slower than expected. Together with additional liquidity arising from the inflow of foreign funds into the system, this led to a situation where commercial banks began increasing their portfolio of government securities and reducing the rates offered on deposits, resulting in lower interest rates at Treasury bill auctions. Overall, the reduction in deposit rates exceeded the reduction in lending rates, as evidenced by a fall in the average weighted deposit rate (AWDR) from 12.3 per cent in December 1996, to 10.0 per cent in December

1997, in comparison to a fall in the average weighted lending rate (AWLR) from 21.0 per cent to 20.1 per cent in the same period. However, the average prime lending rate (AWPR) declined faster from 18.4 per cent to 14.2 per cent during the same period, but the volume of lending at prime lending rate was relatively small.

A considerable inflow of foreign assets was experienced through the receipts from the Government's privatisation efforts, mobilisation of foreign funds by the development finance institutions and international compensation to victims of the war in Kuwait. These inflows added to the liquidity in the system and led to a further reduction in interest rates.

Monetary policy during the second and third quarters of 1997 was therefore directed towards ensuring an orderly reduction in interest rates. Towards this end, the Central Bank engaged in open market operations (OMO) to mop up excess liquidity. When the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills were exhausted, the Bank issued its own securities for OMO. This is the first occasion since 1994 that the Bank has issued its own securities. Short-term Central Bank securities, with maturities of 7 days and 28 days were issued to stabilise the lower end of short-term rates. The potential for monetary expansion due to the inflow of privatisation proceeds was offset to a large extent by an immediate retirement of Rs.10,000 million worth of Treasury bills held by the Central Bank and the build up of government deposits with the Central Bank.

Towards the end of the year, when there was some

uncertainty in the foreign exchange market due to the East

Asian currency crisis and with inflation being a little higher

than expected, short-term interest rates were increased

slightly. The repurchase rate, which had been gradually

reduced to 7 per cent by April, and stood at 9 per cerit

during most of the fourth quarter, was increased to 11 per

cent in December. This was both to ensure a positive real

rate of return in the short-end of the market when somewhat

tighter inflation was seen in November and December, and

to stabilise the foreign exchange market. The margin between

the Central Bank's discount and rediscount rate for Treasury

bills was also increased to influence the cost of liquidity

provided by the Bank.

Money Supply

Despite the relaxation of the monetary policy stance in

the early part of the year, the rate of monetary growth

Monetary Aggregates

Chart 1.10.1 Chart 1.10.2 Monetary Aggregates (Annual) Monetary Aggregates (Period Average)

18

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

remained low throughout 1997. Although, in contrast to the

developments in the previous two years, there was a large

increase in the net foreign assets,of the banking system in

1997, slower growth in domestic credit helped contain

monetary expansion. In fact, net credit to government

contracted in 1997 generating an expansionary impact on

money supply. The growth of Broad Money (M2) stood at

13.8 per cent in December 1997. With the sharp decline in

interest rates and inflation in 1997, the opportunity cost of

holding cash or demand deposits declined and Narrow

Money (Ml) grew at a faster pace than in the past two

years. The growth in Ml increased from 4 per cent in 1996

to 9.8 per cent in 1997.

Private sector credit grew moderately by 11.4 per cent, as against 7.8 per cent in 1996. Both supply and demand factors contributed to this moderate growth. Commercial banks exercised greater caution in extending credit from their domestic units. Demand too was constrained, with some borrowers adopting a wait and see approach towards large scale investments, while others resorted to credit from FCBUs or development finance institutions. Some corporate borrowers also obtained funds directly from investors through rights issues and the issue of commercial paper due to a downward rigidity in commercial bank lending rates, reducing the demand for bank credit. However, a somewhat different picture emerges when one considers total lending, inclusive of credit from FCBUs.

In view of the increasing impact of FCBU transactions

on the domestic economy, a consolidated monetary survey

including both the domestic units and the FCBUs of

commercial banks has been compiled. The consolidated

monetary survey indicated a 13.2 per cent point to point

growth in broad money at end 1997, in comparison to a

growth of 11.3 per cent at end 1996. As in the case of the

conventional monetary survey including the domestic units

alone, net credit to the government from the banking system

showed a contraction. However, in contrast to the results in

the domestic unit monetary survey, credit to the private

sector has grown by 14.3 per cent in 1997. in comparison

to 8.9 per cent in 1996. Total credit extended to the private

sector amounted to Rs.32,878 million in 1997, as against

Rs.30,789 million in 1996, indicating an increase in the

credit from FCBUs. This credit from FCBUs is obtained

mainly by BOI firms. With approximately 16 per cent of

GDP coming from the manufacturing sector and 82 per cent

of industrial exports being accounted for by BOI firms, it

is clear that FCBUs have provided a significant amount of

credit for economic activity in the country. The consolidated

monetary survey also indicates that the slower growth in

credit from the domestic units of commercial banks is offset

by the additional credit provided by the FCBUs.

Credit to the private sector from all financial institutions

Savings Bank) grew by 11.3 per cent compared to 10.1 per

1.12 Problems and Issues

The Sri Lanka economy has shown its resilience again

in 1997 in the context of a highly uncertain global

environment. The East Asian crisis which is considered to

be one of the most serious crises since the breakdown of

the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, had little

impact on the Sri Lanka economy in 1997. The East Asian

crisis has underscored the importance of sound financial

systems, consistent macroeconomic and exchange rate

policies and effective prudential and supervisory systems in

the context of capital account liberalisation.

Sri Lanka's current account transactions are fully liberalised. In addition, there is no surrender requirement for export proceeds. The country has adopted a cautious approach in moving towards capital account liberalisation. The capital account has been partially liberalised, and is relatively freer than in many other developing countries. Foreign portfolio investors are permitted to invest in the share market with the freedom to repatriate capital, capital gains and dividends, but transactions have to be channelled through special accounts, known as 'Share Investment External Rupee Accounts' (SIERA). Foreign direct investment is permitted up to 100 per cent ownership, except in a few restricted areas, and up to 49 per cent ownership in financial institutions, without any restriction on the repatriation of capital, profits and dividends. Exporters have

20

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

access to foreign currency borrowing from either the

domestic banking units or from FCBUs without restriction,

but subject to the capacity of banks to lend. All enterprises

under Section 17 of the Board of Investment Law have been

permitted to borrow from FCBUs. All other foreign private

investment inflows and outflows are allowed with approval.

With this relatively liberal capital account, the existing

capital controls which limit the short-term foreign exposure

of commercial banks and existing restrictions on private

sector foreign borrowings have been one of the major factors

that protected the economy against the short-run contagion

and spillover effects of the East Asian financial crisis. The

inflow of short-term debt has been around 10 per cent of

total capital inflows and most of it had been in the form of

supply of raw materials for export processing industries.

Prior to end 1995, Sri Lanka's commercial banks,

except the FCBUs, were not allowed to- borrow abroad. They

could only maintain day to day working balances. The net

short-term exposure on account of these working balances

amounted to only 5-10 per cent of their capital funds,

including reserves. However, when there was heavy demand

for foreign borrowing by industrialists, particularly in view

of the high domestic interest rates, it was thought appropriate

to allow this facility under a system with adequate

safeguards. Hence, a facility to obtain foreign currency loans

was granted to non-BOI exporters through domestic banks

in January 1997, while placing a limit of 15 per cent on the

net foreign liabilities of commercial banks in relation to their

capital funds. The scheme has been operating smoothly and

net outstanding liabilities have been maintained below the

expected total limit of US dollars 100 million while the gross

rollover of credit had been US dollars 253 million in 1997.

This helped to protect the banks as. well as the local

entrepreneurs against excessive foreign exposure. '

• Another factor which helped to maintain relatively stable financial markets in 1997 in the midst of the East Asian financial market turmoil, was the flexible management of the exchange rate; The exchange market plays a significant role in the rate determination, while the Central Bank intervenes to reduce excessive volatility of rates with a band of 2 per cent between its buying and selling rates. The rate determination is monitored on the basis of a large basket of 24 currencies of competitors and trading partners, while also taking into consideration underlying trends in the balance of payments and other macro economic indicators. However, given the degree of import dependence, particularly for some essential consumer goods, as well as intermediate goods, such as petroleum and fertiliser, and investment goods, the inflation feedback effects are relatively large. The current exchange rate management system has the flexibility to allow the exchange rate to change according to underlying macro economic fundamentals while also giving due consideration to the inflation/exchange rate feedback effect.

Sri Lanka also had favourable balance of payments and

external assets positions, in addition to a declining debt

burden. The balance of payments had an overall surplus of

US dollars 163 million the external assets were sufficient to

finance 5.8 months of imports, total stock of debt as a ratio

of GDP had declined sharply from 70 per cent in 1996 to

63 per cent in 1997 and the debt service payments were

manageable. These, together with timely and appropriate

monetary policy responses, including those through moral

suasion and enhanced surveillance on bank operations, helped

to counteract excessive speculative forces that appeared to

emerge in the domestic financial markets during the height

of the East Asian currency turmoil. The Central Bank

intervened in the exchange market to help stabilise financial

markets.

With the currency crisis in East Asia, there has been

renewed interest in the debate on the choice of an

appropriate exchange rate regime. It is has been widely

accepted'that the maintenance of fixed or pegged exchange

rate regimes is not possible in the absence of supportive

fiscal and monetary policies and the choice of an appropriate

exchange rate regime has been left to the individual

governments. In the context of Sri Lanka, the current

managed float system where there has been a gradual

depreciation, reflecting Underlying macro-economic

conditions, has functioned well. It is likely that some East

Asian countries will have improved upon their international

competitiveness once the pass through effects of the

exchange rate depreciation to prices, wages and cost of

production have completed their full course. This is unlikely

to be a major challenge for Sri Lanka, as many other

countries will face this situation, and the exchange rate will

flexibly adjust at the required speed.

While the short-term contagion effects of the East Asian

crisis have been avoided, some specific export items such

as diamonds, rubber and coconut appear to face tougher

competition due to the sharp contraction of demand in East

Asia and price declines after the currency depreciation. The

affected East Asian countries are responding to the crisis by

trying to put their houses in order through strong and painful

adjustment measures. According to the April 1998 World

Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary

Fund, the near term growth prospects for affected East Asian

countries are weaker than expected mainly due to the sharp

contraction of domestic demand. The report, however,

predicts a continuing recovery of confidence and a moderate

pick up in economic activity is expected. Based on a survey

of 500 companies, which included 100 of the largest

multinational companies (MNC), and a response rate of 40

per cent, the UNCTAD expects inward foreign direct

investment to increase in the short and medium-term due to

lower costs for MNC operations in the region. The more

comprehensive WEO of the IMF predicts a sharp slowing

down of net private capital flows to all developing countries.

World economic growth is expected to be lower by one-

percentage point with a negative growth rate for ASEAN-4

(Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand). Total

imports by economically developed countries are expected to

be lower by about 1.8 percentage points, from 8.6 per cent

in 1997 to 6.8 per cent in 1998. Sri Lanka, which is an open

economy, cannot be totally insulated from the effects of the

changes in the world economy and may be somewhat

affected by the expected slowing down in world economic

growth.

There are several ways that the country can minimise

the possible adverse implications of the slowing down of the

global economy. First and foremost is the need to further

improve fiscal consolidation with a view to reducing the

crowding out of resources by the Government and to provide

the basis for non-inflationary growth. This programme is

already underway aiming at reducing the overall budget

deficit to 4 per cent of GDP in the medium term. A current

account surplus will help to increase domestic savings in a

situation when both private foreign direct investment and

official capital inflows would be slowing down due to factors

outside the control of Sri Lanka. As mentioned above, the

adverse developments in the world economy have been

taking place when Sri Lanka's macroeconomic fundamentals

were improving due to improved macroeconomic

management. However, it is important that recent

macroeconomic achievements are not allowed to be reversed.

In fact, they should be further strengthened with a view to

achieving a sustained reduction in the inflation fate and

accelerating economic growth. In this regard, further fiscal

consolidation towards a significant current account surplus

and an overall deficit of not more than 4 per cent of GDP

should be the medium-term target.

. The globalisation of economies will continue, possibly

with a slight slowing.down of the process during the next

2 to 3 years, with the lessons from the East Asian, crisis.

The key lesson to be learnt from the East Asian crisis is that

globalisation was not the root cause of the crisis. Rather, the

lack of preparation to meet the challenges after full

liberalisation of the capital account and a host of other

factors mentioned above were the forces behind the crisis.

In this context, Sri Lanka has to ensure that the financial

system is regulated, monitored and supervised to ensure its

soundness. The strengthening of the financial system has

received priority in the ongoing financial sector reform

agenda. Measures are being taken to strengthen the financial

system. The necessary legal background has been prepared

and directives have been issued to the banks to ensure

banking system soundness.

Meanwhile action is being taken to improve the

operational autonomy of the state banks in the form of

memoranda of understanding between the Government and

the two state banks. In the past, the cost of operational

inefficiencies and government directed lending had be borne

by the average consumer in the form of high inflation, as

the Government had to incur heavy expenditure to bail out

these banks and this expenditure had to be financed through

high taxes or expansionary borrowing.

Monetary policy is being conducted with the prime

objective of maintaining price stability, with a low rate of

inflation. A large exchange rate depreciation is not necessary

if inflation is brought under control. High inflation requires

currency depreciation, which raises cost of production and

erodes industry profitability. In the case of Sri Lanka there

is a strong relationship between wage increases and inflation.

Given the country's high trade dependence (70 per cent of

GDP) and the need to maintain international competitiveness,'

there is a growing need to link wage increases to

productivity gains. The widespread practice of linking wages

to inflation indicators introduces an inflationary bias to the

labour market. Thus there is an immediate need to eliminate

this inflationary bias.

The above relates to the next important policy reform

which is essential to promote private investment. That is

labour market reforms. The Government is working on a

labour charter, which is expected to lay down the guidelines

on wage norms and labour mobility. The following matters

need urgent attention.

The need to promote labour market flexibility in

employment, because labour rigidities discourage new

employment in a background of high unemployment; •

Linking wage increases to productivity gains and flexible' wage systems linked to incentives;

Moderation of labour laws to give equal protection to

employers and employees;

Promotion of an active competition policy.

It is increasingly recognised that labour market reforms

to promote competitive conditions are vital for the success

of economic liberalisation and promotion of new

employment. Pending a full scale review of the efficiency

of labour markets, promotion of liberal sub contracting and

outsourcing may prove helpful for the emancipation of labour

markets.

The Government has been the provider of most

economic and social infrastructure services in Sri Lanka.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Meanwhile, it is increasingly recognized that many economic

infrastructure services are not public goods and that those

can be provided more efficiently through the private sector.

The policy environment for private sector participation in

economic infrastructure has been strengthened through a

general improvement in the macro economic conditions, the

privatisation programme and various fiscal incentives. To

provide financial support, the institutional structure is being

strengthened. The Private Sector Infrastructure Development

Company Ltd, was established in 1997, with financial

support from the World Bank. The private sector has

gradually entered some areas such as health, education, postal

services, mass media, telecommunication and transport on its

own initiative as well as a result of the Government's

conscious policy of promoting private sector led growth.

Despite all these efforts' the current levels of investment in

these sectors are still inadequate. Considerable improvement

is necessary in key areas such as roads, the transport network

including railways, supply of energy, ports, and social

infrastructure, over and above what has already been

achieved.

The investment policy needs to concentrate on the

development of infrastructure and raising government

investment in areas such as roads, education, and health and

community development without increasing the size of

government in terms of employment. The implementation

and the management of these projects need to be assigned

to the private sector including the use of foreign experts,

where necessary, to improve the quality and efficiency of

operations. This will help to raise the investment ratio. As

the availability of domestic resources and foreign

concessional aid would be limited, raising of foreign funding

to finance infrastructure through international capital markets

would be necessary to supplement domestic resources. A

reduction in the access to concessional aid has been a

common problem faced by developing countries and the

Group of 24 (G24) developing countries already expressed

deep concern about the continuation of the declining trend

in Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) that began in

the early 1990s. ODA to all countries from OECD countries

fell to 0.25 per cent of their GNP in 1996 - the lowest level

in the last three decades. In this context it would be

advisable for Sri Lanka to establish an international credit

rating and make its presence felt in the international capital

markets through a medium-term bond issue for a limited

sum. This needs to done while making further progress in

the area of structural reforms to facilitate accelerated

investment by the private sector while preserving

macroeconomic stability at all times. The international

environment for bond issuers in emerging market economies

is improving and some countries in East Asia has already

re-entered the international private capital markets.

The trade policy relating to the non-plantation

agricultural sector has not been transparent. Ad-hoc changes

in tariffs and state intervention in trade has made'the policy

environment unpredictable. This has become a constraint for

efficient functioning of markets. The Government needs to

clearly define the degree of protection that should be

afforded to the domestic agricultural sector through tariffs.

The tariff rate for agricultural commodities which have to

compete with imports may be placed at the current maximum

duty rate of 35 per cent for a stipulated period with a plan

for gradual reduction thereafter to be in line with further

rationalisation of tariffs.

The Central Bank's Annual Report for 1996 highlighted

the need to strengthen structural reforms in many other areas

to remove impediments to accelerated economic expansion.

They included the introduction of a flexible pricing formula

for wheat flour, minimising Government involvement in

economic activities such as procurement, importing and

trading of agricultural commodities to improve market

efficiency, strengthening of research and development in the

non-plantation sector and extension services to improve

productivity; and civil service and pension reforms to

improve the efficiency of the service and reducing the burden

on the budget due to rising wage and pension bills.

Courageous decisions will have to be taken in all these areas

for the country to be able to grow faster as an emerging

market economy.
