External Resources under the title "IDA 2928 CE - Health Services Project".

3. Every Letter of Credit opened by your Bank unless otherwise advised by me, should provide that the

negotiating Bank will be reimbursed by IDA and that the Letter of Credit will become operative only when

IDA issues its special commitment in favour of the negotiating bank.

4. Applications for special commitment to IDA should be made by your customer on Form 1931 (Extract

(b) the description or quantity of goods;

(c) the beneficiary; and

(d) any extension of the expiry date of the Letter of Credit more than six months beyond the original date

or beyond the date quoted in the special commitment issued by IDA.

N o other amendments require IDA'S prior approval.

6. Since the captioned line of credit is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDR) the IDA will specify the SDR commitment in its Special Commitment Letter to the negotiating bank in respect of Letters of

vii

Credit expressed in another currency. If due to this limitation of its commitment, IDA does not reimburse

the full amount of the foreign currency to your correspondent abroad as specified in the Letter of Credit

you may remit the balance due to the negotiating bank in accordance with the instructions issued to you in

this regard by the Controller of Exchange.

7. Importers under this credit are not required to pay the rupee value of the shipping documents involved to

the Government's Counterpart Fund account. You may therefore, release such documents to your custom­

ers no sooner they are received by you after recovering commissions, chargeserc, if any, due to you or to

the negotiating bank.

8. Copies of Letter of Credit and amendments, if any, should be forwarded to the Chief Accountant, Central

Bank of Sri Lanka, Colombo, for information.
