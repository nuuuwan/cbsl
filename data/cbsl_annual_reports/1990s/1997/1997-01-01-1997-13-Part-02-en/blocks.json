The guidelines issued under the Monetary Law Act in respect of income recognition of non-performing advances and the adequacy of provisions for bad and doubtful debts were re-issued under the Banking Act and became a statutory requirement in terms of Section 46A of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 as amended by Banking (Amendment) Act No. 33 of 1995. Similarly, capital adequacy requirements, which were hitherto enforced under the Monetary Law Act, were brought under the Banking Act. In August 1997, three new directions were issued to LCBs covering investment in shares, acquisition of property by banks and the revision of the existing direction on the maximum accommodation that a licensed bank could extend in the aggregate, to a group of companies.",

During the year, repayments in respect of 1,932 loans amounting to Rs.l,033.9 million have been completed by the borrowers while credit guarantees of 65 loans worth Rs. 83.4 million have been either withdrawn or lapsed due to non-compliance with the Central Bank's Operating Instructions by the Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs). At the end of 1997, credit guarantees in respect of 6,137 loans amounting to Rs.4,029.6 million were operational and the Central Bank's liability in respect of these loans amounted to Rs.2,491. million. At the end of 1997, a total of 156 claims amounting to Rs.93.3 million had been received. The cumulative guarantee premium collections from SMI-IV at the end of 1997 stood at Rs.131.1 million while the total post-claim recoveries amounted to Rs.2.4 million.

Hence, several groups operating in a village were amalgamated into SFLC Development Societies (ISURU SANVARDENA SAMITHI) which were registered with the Registrar of Companies as corporate bodies with limited liability under the Societies Ordinance. At the end of 1997, 110 such limited liability societies had been formed.",

    "text": "The shrimp farming industry, a rising foreign exchange earner, continued to suffer from the white spot disease which affected it adversely in 1996. A relief package was introduced by lending banks to this industry in 1996 at the instigation of the Central Bank to facilitate fast recovery and rehabilitation of the affected ponds. The relief package included a loan moratorium for 15 months, rescheduling of the outstanding loans at an interest rate of 5 per cent per annum, extension of new loans at the prevailing average prime lending rate, quick repayment of the outstanding loans from the new harvests and technical assistance from the National Aquatic Resources Agency (NARA) for the rehabilitation of ponds. While about a half of the farmers utilised this facility, it was felt by mid 1997, that the rehabilitation took longer than originally planned. Hence, at the request of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, the Central Bank persuaded the lending banks to continue the relief package for a further period. Accordingly, the moratorium was extended by a further period of 8 months from September 1997 at an interest rate of 5 per cent per annum.",

In terms of these regulations, the existing PDs for Treasury bills and Central Bank Securities (CBSs) were appointed PDs for Treasury bonds. Having finalised these arrangements, the PDD launched the issue of Treasury bonds in March 1997 and the first auction was held on 27 February 1997 for the first issue of Treasury bonds value dated 2 March 1997. During the year, the PDD also engaged in developing the modalities to improve the primary issue and trading of this instrument in the secondary market.

The second largest category was the non-bank PDs who purchased 21.3 per cent of the total. Until May 1997 several institutions such as the National Co-operative Council (NCC) and Employees' Trust Fund (ETF) were allowed to bid directly at the primary auctions. These institutional investors, together with CBSL managed funds were responsible for 8.3 per cent of the bids accepted in 1997.

During 1997, 18 issues, of which .13 were 2 year maturities, 2 were 3 year maturities and 3 were 4 year maturities, were made. Of the 10 billion of Treasury bonds issued, Rs. 7,500 million was in respect of 2 year maturities, Rs. 1000 million was in respect of 3 year maturities and RS. 1,500 million was in respect of 4 year maturities. The coupon rate was announced by the CBSL prior to each auction. In view of money market developments that exerted pressure on the interest rates, the coupon rate was reduced from 14 per cent per annum at the beginning to 11.5 per cent per annum at the end of the year. All auctions held during 1997 were over-subscribed and there were bids at par and at a premium at all but one auction. Of the total bids received during the year Rs. 14,216 million of bids were received at a premium, Rs. 9,135 million of bids were received at par and Rs. 4,898 million of bids were received at a discount. The bids received from institutional investors who were allowed to receive a weighted average yield to. maturity, amounted to Rs. 4,790 million.

There has been a rising demand for these publications, particularly for Satahana, which on an average has a sale of around 10,000 copies per month. The News Survey however, has not met with similar success being constrained by its limited readership in the English medium. The Department was able to reach a wider spectrum of readers when it successfully ran a sales counter at the Industrial and Trade Exhibition -Jana Nipayuma - held from the 1 to 5 July 1997 in commemoration of the 36th anniversary of the People's Bank.",

The scheme was further extended to monitor the agricultural situation in major growing areas.

The sub sectors of paddy, tea, rubber, coconut cultivation and the small scale construction, sector are covered by the scheme.

The rehabilitation work of the building has been awarded to M/s. Ed Zublin AG of Stuttgart, Germany and the consultancy services in respect of project management, design approvals, construction supervision and architectural and M & E design and drawings, have been assigned to Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau. The order to commence the repair work was issued to the contractor in December 1997 after the Currency Department was re\u00adlocated in the Treasury Building. In December 1997, the contractor commenced the dismantling of damaged machinery and equipment, windows and sanitary fittings, electrical and air-conditioning fittings, demolishing of damaged walls etc. and removal of architectural elements from the building in order to facilitate repair work.",
