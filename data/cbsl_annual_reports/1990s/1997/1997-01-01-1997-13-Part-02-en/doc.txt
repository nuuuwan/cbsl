Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

ACCOUNTS AND BANKING OPERATIONS

The total assets/liabilities of the Central Bank at end 1997, stood at Rs. 183,895 million registering an increase of 1.3 per cent over the previous year. As in the previous years, the total volume of international reserves has become the largest single asset category accounting for 64.7 per cent of the total assets at end 1997, compared to 56.8 per cent at end 1996. This was an increase of approximately 15 per cent over the previous year. The main contributory factor for this increase was receipts on account of privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom and the sale of foreign exchange by the National Development Bank. Domestic assets, on the other hand, showed a decrease of 20.5 per cent, from Rs.47,965 million to Rs.38,134 million due to the retirement of Rs.10,000 million worth of Treasury bills held by the Bank.

Among the domestic assets, loans and advances to Government increased by 2.2 per cent, while Government and Government guaranteed securities decreased by 57.8 per cent. Medium and long-term credit facilities to commercial banks and other credit institutions declined by 24.9 per cent mainly due to net repayments and provisions on account of non-performing loans. Short term advances to commercial banks also declined by 32 per cent in 19971.

On the liabilities side, currency in circulation increased by 7.4 per cent from Rs. 49,480 million to Rs. 53,135 million. As in the previous year, deposits constituted the largest category of liabilities and accounted for 37.8 per cent of the total liabilities. Within the category, the deposits held by the Government increased by 84.5 per cent, while the deposits of commercial banks maintained with the Central Bank against their deposit liabilities, under the statutory reserve requirement decreased by 15 per cent. Meanwhile, the deposits of international organisations, foreign governments and foreign banking institutions decreased by 8.2 per cent. A comparison of the major components of assets and liabilities of the Bank is shown in Table II-2.

The total gross income of the Bank for the year 1997 was Rs. 19,498 million compared with Rs. 18,711 miIlion:

in 1996, while the total gross expenditure in 1997 was Rs. 16,848 million compared with Rs. 17,211. million during the previous year. Around 77 per cent of the income of the Bank was generated from investments of foreign reserves, while interest earned from domestic transactions accounted for about 23.0 per cent. After making allowances for expenditure and allocations to reserves, provisions for depreciation and bad debts and other charges, the balance net profit of the

( I V )

outstanding, before provisions for bad debts, was Rs. 2,585.2

million at the end of 1997.

liabilities of commercial banks was revised twice during the

year 1997. The SRR on commercial banks' rupee deposits

was reduced from 15 per cent to 14 per cent with effect

from 17 January 1997 and from 14 per cent to 12 per cent

with effect from 28 March 1997. The SRR on commercial

banks' foreign currency deposits invested outside Sri Lanka

was abolished with effect from 17 January 1997 while the

SRR on all other deposits of commercial banks denominated

in foreign currency was reduced from 15 per cent to 12 per

cent with effect from 28 March 1997.

Foreign Currency Loan Facility to Non-BOI Exporters

The Bank introduced a scheme in January 1997 to facilitate non-BOI exporters and indirect, exporters to obtain foreign currency loans. Under this scheme commercial banks have been authorised to grant credit, facilities in foreign currency through their Domestic Banking Units (DBUs) and Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs). At the commencement of the scheme banks were advised to provide US dollars 100 million, through their FCBUs and this amount was allocated among the banks on the basis of their capital funds.

The total loans granted under the scheme during the year 1997 amounted to US dollars 254 million, out of which US dollars 245 million was given by DBUs while the balance of US dollars 9 million was given through FCBUs. At the end of 1997, the outstanding amount of loans granted under the scheme was US dollars 70.7 million, while loans had been provided at interest rates of 6.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent with a maturity period of approximately one year.

Open Market Operations

Secondary Treasury Bill Market

The.sale (discounting) of Treasury bills in the secondary market of the Central Bank amounted to Rs.19,442 million in 1997 compared with Rs.16,000 million in the preceding year. The excess liquidity condition that prevailed in the market, particularly during the latter part of the year 1997 resulted in increased sales. The purchases (re-discounting) of Treasury bills also increased marginally from Rs.l7,000 million in 1996 to Rs.17,337 million in 1997.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

The Central Bank's secondary market yield rates moved in line with trends witnessed in the primary market yield rates during 1997. The yield rates on 3 month Treasury bills in the secondary window of the Central Bank gradually decreased from 17.1 per cent at the beginning of the year to 9.97 per cent at the end of the year. The rates on 6 month and 12 month Treasury bills too declined from 17.03 per cent and 17.11 per cent, respectively, at the beginning of the year to 10.09 per cent and 10.21 per cent, respectively, at the end of the year reflecting an excess liquidity situation towards the end of the year.

Repurchase Market For Treasury Bills

The sale of Treasury bills under Repurchase Agreements (repos) introduced by the Central Bank in October 1993 with a view to stabilising the lower end of the call market rates, continued to be in operation during the year 1997.

The overnight repo rate was decreased gradually from 12.75 per cent at the beginning of the year to 7 per cent at end March, 1997 reflecting excess rupee liquidity in the market. It varied between 7 per cent and 9 per cent during the months of April to November and rose to 9.5 per cent in the first week of December 1997. However,'by the end of the year, the repo rate was increased to 11 per cent as a result of the gradual tightening of rupee liquidity during the month of December.

The total volume of Treasury bills sold under Repurchase Agreements during the year recorded an 11 per cent increase from Rs.404,000 million in 1996 to Rs.449,589 million in 1997 indicating further expansion of investments under repos by commercial banks.

Reverse Repurchase Agreements

The reverse repurchase scheme of the Central Bank was introduced in November 1995 with the intention of stabilising the upper end of the call market interest rates. In view of the continued liquidity in the market during 1997, there was no necessity for the Central Bank to inject rupee funds through its reverse repurchase scheme. Consequently, this scheme was inactive in 1997.

Subsidy and Ex-gratia Payments to Indian Repatriates

Total subsidy payments made to repatriated estate workers of Indian origin covered under the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of 1964, on behalf of the Government, amounted to Rs. 48,191 in 1997 compared to Rs. 125,953 in 1996. Ex-gratia payments amounted to Rs.2,475 in 1997 compared to Rs.7,475 in 1996.

the ACU arrangement during the period under review was

Rs.494 million.

Compulsory Savings Fund

Law No. 15 of 1972 and continued to administer the

CURRENCY ISSUE

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka as the sole issuing

authority continued to perform the functions of issuing legal

tender currency in Sri Lanka for the use of domestic

transactions during the year 1997. The volume of currency

in circulation at end 1997 stood at Rs.53,135 million as

against Rs.49,480 million at the end of 1996.

A section of the Ground Floor of the General Treasury

Building including the main vault and a sub vault were

refurbished by the Central Bank during the year 1997 in

order to facilitate some^of the operational work of the

Currency Department. The shifting to the General Treasury

Building of three sections of the Currency Department

namely, Issue Section, Deposit Section and the Currency

Verification, Counting and Sorting Systems (CVCS) Section

was effected in December 1997.

The two units which were responsible for the issue of

currency to the public at People's Bank Lake Side Building,

Colombo 10 and Bank of Ceylon Tower Building, Fort were

amalgamated and housed in the Muslim Islamic Cultural Hall

(MICH) Building, Bristol Street, Colombo 1 during the year

1997 which ensured an undisrupted issue of currency to the

general public.

The Central Bank issues special coins to commemorate

events of national and international significance. During

1997, arrangements were made by the Currency Department

to issue a 200 Rupee polymer currency note to mark the

50th Anniversary of Sri Lanka regaining Independence. This

novel bank note will be the first of its kind in Sri Lanka

and also the first commemorative bank note to be issued by

the Bank, depicting pictorial themes relevant to the history

and development of Sri Lanka. Arrangements have been

made to issue an attractive commemorative note folder for

numismatists.

Arrangements were also made to issue three

commemorative coins in Gold, Silver and bi-metal. The legal

tender value of these coins would be Rs.5,000, Rs.l,000 and

Rs.10, respectively. This Rs. 10 coin will also be the first

bi-metal coin to be issued in Sri Lanka. It was proposed that,

the Gold and Silver commemorative coins would be sold

above their legal tender value.

approval was granted for the speicalised banks to open 10

branches. The total number of branches opened by the

specialised banks was 10. The branch network of the

commercial banks, RRDBs and specialised banks expanded

by 122 to number 1,461 branches at end 1997.

REGIONAL OFFICES

During 1997, the Regional Offices of the Central Bank

at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale continued to carry out

development activities and the traditional central banking

functions assigned to them. The main activities of the

Regional Offices included currency operations ( in Matara

and Anuradhapura), cheque clearing activities, data collection,

participation in the Consumer Finances and Socio Economic

Survey 1996/97, conducting beneficiary training programmes,

inspection of the Regional Rural Development Banks

(RRDBs), assisting in regional development projects and co­

ordinating with government departments, agencies and

organisations involved in development work in the region.

The Matara Regional Office continued to handle the activities relating to the implementation of the Small Holder Tea Development Project (SHTDP), the Southern Province Rural Development Project (SPRDP), Perennial Crops Development Project (PCDP), Surathura Diriya Credit Scheme and the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project. The Regional Office also assisted in conducting workshops and training programmes for officers of participating credit institutions in the region in respect of the SHTDP, SPRDP and Surathura Diriya Programme. Under the SPRDP, the Regional Office appraised around 100 projects to examine their viability and to ensure the proper utilisation of project funds in respect of existing projects in the districts of Matara, Galle and Hambantota. A sample survey of the loans granted under the Surathura Diriya Credit Scheme was conducted in the Matara, Hambantota and Moneragala districts. The Regional Office also assisted other development programmes implemented by government departments and

financial institutions in the region. Further, it has carried out

the inspection of a number of branches of RRDBs. The

Currency Unit of the Regional Office continued to provide

currency exchange facilities to the public as well as deposit

and withdrawal facilities for commercial banks in the region.

During the year, 215,046 cheques amounting to Rs.3,592

million were cleared at the Regional Cheque Clearing House

at Matara.

The Anuradhapura Regional Office, in association with

government departments and agencies involved in

development activities, conducted 21 training programmes in

the fields of agriculture, dairy farming, post harvesting

techniques and entrepreneurship development with the

objective of upgrading the living standards of the rural

community. A total of 350 persons attended these

programmes. Agriculture training programmes included

lectures on modern farming, water management and fruit

cultivation. Under the entrepreneurship development

programmes unemployed youth were given training in the

fields of resource identification, banking, marketing etc. The

Regional Office conducted six educational programmes for

Advanced Level students in the districts of Anuradhapura,

Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala which were attended by 1,459

students. Three 'Janahamuwa' meetings were organised

among rural people in order to create an awareness of the

facilities provided by the Government and the banking sector.

The Regional office also monitored two special projects,

namely the North Central Province Participatory Rural

Development Project (NCP-PRDP) and the North Central

Province Rural Development Project (NCP-RDP). Two

participatory NGOs (involved in these two projects) were

given a training in banking by conducting four seminars. The

Regional Office conducted two sample surveys, one on loans

granted under the Surathura Diriya Credit Scheme and the

other on the marketing of chillies and problems related

thereto in the region. Further, the Regional Office carried out

the inspection of branches of RRDBs in the districts of

Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Polonnaruwa. The Regional

Office also accepted deposits and issued currency to

commercial banks. The Regional Clearing House cleared

205,354 cheques valued at Rs.2,222 million during the year.

The Matale Regional Office conducted six beneficiary training programmes on a variety of subjects including dairy farming, poultry farming, home gardening, systematic preparation of rice and nurseries in order to provide avenues for self employment. Two seminars were also Conducted on topics relevant to Advanced Level students. A total of 1,422 students participated in these programmes, The Regional Office continued to identify new projects in the region. During this period the Regional Office prepared 18 feasibility reports on small scale industrial projects. The reports were forwarded to the financial institutions in the area so that they

(VIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

could assist entrepreneurs. The Regional Office conducted

'Janahamuwas' in rural areas to educate farmers on banking

facilities and also assisted in conducting exhibitions and sales

of the products of small scale entrepreneurs. The Regional

Office also continued to handle activities relating to the

Small Holder Tea Development Project and the Perennial

Crops Development .Project. Further, it carried out the

inspection of several RRDB branches and examined the

activities of RRDBs in the region. The two regional clearing

houses at Matale and Kandy cleared 164,973 cheques

amounting to Rs.2,061 million arid 691,955 cheques

amounting to Rs.22,162 million, respectively.

REGIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS

During 1997, the Regional Rural Development Banks

(RRDBs) continued to provide finance for the development

of agriculture, fisheries, cottage and small scale industry,

commerce and other development activities in the rural

sector.

Branch Network of RRDBs

The total number of RRDBs in operation in 17 districts

remained unchanged at 17 at the end of 1997. With the

opening of the Godakawela branch of the Ratnapura RRDB,

in February 1997, the total number of branches of RRDBs

rose from 175 in 1996 to 176 in 1997. (Table II-5)

Arrangements are under way for the early establishment of

Regional Development Banks. Hence, branch expansion by RRDBs was considerably reduced, since the business of RRDBs will be vested in Regional Development Banks (RDBs) when they are established and the RDBs could then decide on further branch expansion.

Deposit Mobilisation

The RRDBs continued to mobilise deposits during 1997,

In order to mobilise savings in rural areas, the RRDBs had

introduced several attractive savings schemes and provided

mobile banking services. The total deposits mobilised by

RRDBs as at the end of the first nine months of the year

stood at Rs. 2,404 million, an increase of 18 per cent above

the level at end 1996. The number of accounts related to

these deposits exceeded one million, rising from 993,434 at

end 1996 to 1,037,981 at end 1997. Savings deposits

continued to constitute the bulk of these deposits and

accounted for 70 per cent of the total. The average value

of deposits in a savings account increased marginally from

Rs.l,643 in 1996 to Rs.l,661 in 1997, whereas the average

value of a fixed deposit, declined from Rs.43,160 in 1996

to Rs.42,487 in 1997.

Delivery of Credit

During the first nine months of the year, RRDBs

disbursed loans and advances amounting to Rs.l,781 million

in respect of 274,365 loans. During the same period, i.e.

January to September, last year, RRDBs had disbursed only

Rs. 1,403 million in respect of 207,505 loans. However,

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

RRDBs increased the grant of loans and advances

considerably during the latter part of last year, in order to

rebuild their customer base and their level rose to Rs.2,294

million by the end of 1996.

As in the past, the RRDBs continued to grant financial

assistance under various loan schemes introduced by them.

These included special credit schemes for teachers and other

government employees, self employment loans for Samurdhi

recipients, loans for the purchase of trishaws and for the

establishment of service stations and shops selling spare parts

for trishaws.

Other Activities

As mentioned in earlier annual reports, the RRDBs

provided a wide range of ancillary services to their customers

in order to fulfil the developmental role assigned to RRDBs.

They rendered advisory assistance by co-ordinating

beneficiary training programmes for their customers,

including Samurdhi recipients, so that effective programmes

of education, imparting management techniques and new

technology, would motivate customers.

The RRDBs continued to hold 'Janahamuwa' meetings

in villages both in order to create an awareness of banking

facilities as well as to extend credit facilities. The RRDBs

also continued to promote the marketing and processing of

agricultural products. Further, the RRDBs introduced an

island-wide loan scheme for the purchase of trishaws, and

the establishment of service centres and outlets for the sale

of spare parts for trishaws. This project has been launched

with the co-operation of the private sector which will provide

the necessary expertise and training. The scheme will provide

self-employment opportunities for youth in the rural sector.

Another scheme introduced by RRDBs in order to protect

farmers was for the purchase and storage of chillies during

the harvesting season so that the produce could be sold later

at a reasonable price.

The RRDBs acted as participating credit institutions in several special credit schemes, namely, the ADB funded Small Holder Tea Development Project, the Perennial Crops Development Project, the Southern Province Rural Development Project, the North Western Province Water Resources Development Project, the US AID Housing Guarantee Low Income Shelter Project, Small and Medium Scale Industry Loan Project and the Isuru Project.

REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS

On 5 June 1997 the Regional Development Banks Act

No. 6 of 1997 was enacted. It is proposed to establish a

Regional Development Bank (RDB) for each Province which

will take over the business of existing Regional Rural

Development Banks (RRDBs) in the Province. This would

ensure that each Province will have a development bank

which will facilitate the overall development of the Province.

RDBs are expected to mobilise deposits within the

Province as well as from outside the Province and lend to

viable development projects within the Province, bearing in

mind the need to assist the weakest segments of the

population. In addition to financing development oriented

enterprises, these banks will play an active role in

development projects undertaken by Provincial Councils,

Pradeshiya Sabhas and local authorities.

The authorised capital of each Bank will be Rs; 500 million divided into shares of Rs.10* The capital of the RDBs will be initially contributed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, National Savings Bank and the Employees' Provident Fund. The initial issued capital of each bank will be determined having regard to the net asset value of the RRDBs in the Province. The issued capital of RDBs will range between Rs.100 million and Rs.150 million. The RDBs will issue debentures to the Central Bank in respect of any excess of the net assets of RRDBs vested in a RDB over the Central Bank's capital contribution. These debentures will carry an annual interest rate of 12 per cent. If the net worth is less than the issued share capital the difference will be contributed by the Central Bank.

The RDBs will be Licensed Specialised Banks for purposes of the Banking Act and as such will come under the supervision of the Central Bank. They will perform banking and financial operations specified in the Regional Development Banks Act. However, they will not undertake commercial banking operations which involve the handling of current accounts.

BANK SUPERVISION

The regulatory; and supervisory function of the Central Bank relating to banking institutions is undertaken by the Department of Bank Supervision. The Department carries out its functions through periodic on-site examinations and off-site surveillance of all licensed commercial banks (LCBs), Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) and licensed specialised banks (LSBs) in the country. The objective of supervision is to safeguard the interests of depositors by ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking system and promoting public confidence in the financial system.

The scope of on-site examinations covers an appraisal

of the quality of assets to determine the soundness of the

( X )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

assets portfolio. Other aspects such as capital adequacy,

earnings, liquidity, systems, internal controls and procedures

are also examined, together with an evaluation of the

management to assess the overall financial condition of the

bank. The extent to which banks comply with the applicable

laws and regulations are also carefully examined.

Licensed Commercial Banks

During the year under review the Department

commenced 18 on-site examinations in respect of 13 LCBs

and 5 RRDBs and concluded the examinations of 3 LCBs

and 5 RRDBs. In addition, the examinations of 9 LCBs

which had commenced in the previous year were concluded

in 1997. Spot examinations of two RRDBs were also

conducted by the Department which covered certain specific

aspects of their operations.

Under the off-site surveillance system, the Department

continued to monitor the financial condition of the LCBs and

RRDBs on the basis of monthly statements of assets and

liabilities and liquid assets and quarterly statements of capital

adequacy, non performing advances and income and

expenses submitted to the Department. These returns are

closely scrutinised for any significant changes or symptoms

of weaknesses that could have an adverse impact on a bank,

on the basis of which prompt remedial action could be taken.

The Department also continued to monitor the

operations of Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) of

LCBs on the basis of monthly statements of assets and

liabilities and quarterly statements of income and expenses

submitted to the Department. Consequent to the amendments

made to the Banking Act, the Department is now engaged

in the framing of the necessary prudential rules and

determinations to be issued to the FCBUs.

Licensed Specialised Banks

During the year under review the operations of

specialised banking institutions namely, the National

Development Bank, Development Finance Corporation of

Ceylon, National Savings Bank, State Mortgage and

Investment Bank, Pramuka Savings and Development Bank

and Sanasa Development Bank came under the regulatory

authority of the Central Bank in terms of part IX A of the

Banking (Amendment) Act No. 33 of 1995. In this regard

18 directions approved by the Monetary Board were issued

in November 1997 to meet the prudential and regulatory

requirements of the specialised banks. The Department is

engaged in the preparation of periodic returns the LSBs

would be required to furnish to the Department for

monitoring purposes.

Regulatory. Requirements

The Department continued to implement the regulatory requirements under the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 as amended by the Banking (Amendment) Act No. S3 of 1995. These included the maintenance of a minimum level of liquid assets, the adherence to the single borrower limit, minimum capital based on risk-weighted assets, restrictions on accommodation to directors/their close relations and their interests and the submission of annual financial statements within the statutory period. The guidelines issued under the Monetary Law Act in respect of income recognition of non-performing advances and the adequacy of provisions for bad and doubtful debts were re-issued under the Banking Act and became a statutory requirement in terms of Section 46A of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 as amended by Banking (Amendment) Act No. 33 of 1995. Similarly, capital adequacy requirements, which were hitherto enforced under the Monetary Law Act, were brought under the Banking Act. In August 1997, three new directions were issued to LCBs covering investment in shares, acquisition of property by banks and the revision of the existing direction on the maximum accommodation that a licensed bank could extend in the aggregate, to a group of companies.

During the year, the attention of the Bank Supervision Department was drawn to the following violations of the provisions of the Banking Act.

(a) Section 17A(1) and (2) relating to investment in

shares of unquoted companies.

(b) Section 19(7)(a) of the Banking Act relating to

capital adequacy ratios. These capital adequacy

standards are based on the norms specified by the

Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices

Committee (BASLE Committee).

(c) Section 21(1) of the Banking Act relating to the

maintenance of the minimum liquid asset ratio of

20 per cent.

(d) Section 38(1) of the Banking Act relating to the

submission of Annual Audited Accounts.

(e) Section 38(4) of the Banking Act which requires

LCBs to exhibit in a conspicuous place within the

place of business of the LCB the consolidated

Balance Sheet of the Bank.

(f) Section 46(1 )(c) (i) and (ii) of the Banking Act

relating to the maximum amount of accommodation

to customers.

(g) Section 46(1 )(d) of the Banking Act relating to the

Bank imposed penalties for failure to.maintain the Statutory

Reserve Requirement with the Central Bank as well as the

minimum Liquid Assets Ratio in terms of Section 93 of the

Monetary Law Act and Section .21(1) of the Banking Act,

respectively.

The. Department commenced several special

investigations during the year, which are continuing.

During the year under review, the Department was also

engaged in the preparation of the following:

(a) Compilation of a panel of qualified auditors in

terms of Section 38A of the Banking Act. Once

the panel of auditors is approved by the Monetary

Board, LCBs and LSBs are required to select

auditors from this panel to undertake the annual

audits of their respective banks. Banks that are

classified as public corporations however would be

exempted from this requirement.

(b) Rules and regulations in terms of Section 83A of

the Banking'Act relating to pawn broking activities

of the LCBs. With the introduction of these rules

and regulations, the provisions of the Pawn Brokers

Ordinance (chapter 99) shall not apply to a LCB

and such bank may carry on the business of pawn

brokers subject to rules and regulations determined

by the Monetary Board.

Directions Issued under the Banking Act

The following directions were issued to LCBs and LSBs:

(XII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

consisting of 3 RRDBs and 4 Multi Purpose Co-operative

Societies (MPCSs). The premium payable is 3.75 cents per

quarter for every Rs. 100 and amount collected to the fund

by way of premia during the year 1997 was Rs.l 326,488.

The total fund stood at Rs.70,145,474 as at 31 December

1997 which includes Rs.50 million allocated to the fund by

the Central Bank.

SUPERVISION OF NON- BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

The Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial

Institutions continued to carry out its regulatory and

supervisory functions in respect of finance companies (FCs)

with the objective of ensuring that FCs are adequately

capitalised, prudently managed and financially sound. The

Department strived to achieve the above objectives mainly

through off-site surveillance and on-site examinations.

Brief Overview of FCs

The consolidated balance sheet of the 25 registered FCs

as at 31 March 96 and 31 March 97 are given in Table 11-

6. Total assets of registered FCs have increased by Rs. 3.6

billion or 23 per cent'over the year. The increase in assets

was reflected mostly in advances which increased by Rs. 2.4

billion or 24 per cent and liquid assets which increased by

Rs.492.2 million or 31 per cent. The distribution of the major

asset categories had not changed substantially, but the trend

for leasing to account for a larger portion of facilities

granted, which was observed in previous years, was evident

in 1997 too. The growth in assets has been funded by a

growth in deposits of Rs.2.3 billion or 26 per cent and a

growth in capital funds of Rs.428.3 million or 19 per cent.

Regulation and Supervision of Registered FCs

During the period under review, the Department continued its off-site surveillance of the 25 registered FCs analysing periodical statements submitted by these companies to ascertain compliance with Rules and Directions issued under provisions of the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of

1988. For the above purpose the Department continued to obtain weekly statements of liquid assets, monthly statements of large advances granted, monthly statements of assets and liabilities, quarterly statements of non-performing advances and annual audited balance sheets and financial statements based on which adherence to specified minimum capital and liquidity levels, the observance of single borrower limits and adequacy of provisions for bad and doubtful debts were monitored. The profit and growth trends of registered FCs were also monitored closely during the period under review to identify and arrest any adverse developments.

The Department also conducted on-site examinations of

three FCs during the year. The books of accounts and other

records of companies examined were scrutinised and

discussions held with officers of the Company in order to

make an appraisal of the adequacy of capital, quality of

assets, capability of management, volume and quality of

earnings and liquidity position. The efficacy of internal

systems and controls to prevent frauds and to provide timely

and accurate management information were also assessed.

In addition to comprehensive on-site examinations FCs

were subjected to spot examinations, prior to the issue of

annual licences, where a few key items as reported in the

monthly statements of assets and liabilities were checked for

accuracy by reference to the books of accounts and other

records of companies.

Failed FCs

The administration and management of five FCs vested

in the Monetary Board under the provisions of the Finance

Companies Act continued to be performed by the

Department. Relief payments to depositors of two of these

FCs under the-relief scheme for depositors of registered FG

in distress, utilising funds provided by the Central Bank ant

, relief payments under enhanced relief schemes utilising fund?

from loan recoveries and sale of assets amounted to Rs. 5r

million in 1997. During the period under review a further

sum of Rs. 15 million was provided from the Medium ant,

Long Term Credit Fund thus increasing the outstanding

refinance facilities provided by the Central Bank to failed

FCs as at 31 December 1997 to Rs.2,582.2 million. Action

was initiated to sell the immovable assets of two of the

remaining companies with a view to settling a considerable

portion of the deposits of these companies utilising the sale

proceeds. The depositors of the remaining company have

been repaid in full and only the amounts unclaimed remain

unpaid. The Department continued to co-ordinate with and

assist the audit firm which was appointed as the liquidator

in respect of four other failed finance companies. The

liquidation of these companies is proceeding under the

supervision of the District Court of Colombo.

The Department continued to make part refunds of deposits of a failed FC through a Trust Fund set up to channel the sales proceeds of its Head Office Building. A sum of Rs.71.3 million has been paid to 1,928 depositors through this Trust Fund up to 31 December 1997. During the year the Department also initiated action to impose on the Directors of another failed FC which has been issued with a Direction restraining alienation of its immovable assets without Monetary Board approval, to dispose of its assets by calling for offers by advertisement in the newspapers so that the sale proceeds may be distributed in an equitable manner.

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Necessary steps to ensure that errant directors of failed

FCs who contravene the provisions of the Finance

Companies Act or misappropriate funds of FCs are

appropriately dealt with under applicable laws continue to be

taken by the Department. The Department continued giving

all possible assistance to the Police Department in actions

initiated by it in consultation, with the Attorney-General's

Department against errant directors to ensure success in the

cases filed.

Policy Initiatives

During the period under review, the Department

participated in finalising the Draft Bill titled the Finance

Companies (Amendment) Act which incorporates several

amendments to the present law governing the regulation and

supervision of finance companies. Among other things the

proposed amendments enable the Central Bank to specify

higher minimum levels of issued share capital required for

registration as a finance company in keeping with economic

and financial trends in the country.

The Department would be vested with authority for the

registration and supervision of financial leasing companies

in the near future with the enactment of the proposed

legislation for the development of the institutional and

regulatory framework for the financial leasing business in Sri

Lanka.

The Department had discussions with the Finance

Houses Association to inform members and seek their views

on amendments to existing directions and new directions

under consideration. These include:

(a) introduction of minimum capital ratio based on risk

weighted assets;

(b) more stringent income recognition standards;

(c) more stringent guidelines on provisioning for bad

and doubtful debts; and

(d) limiting the types of activities that may be

undertaken by FCs.

FINANCIAL MARKETS

The Financial Markets Department was established in

September 1997, with the overall responsibility for the

development of the financial sector in Sri Lanka. The new

department took over all the work handled by the former

Capital and Financial Markets Development Unit. In addition,

the Department is also responsible for co-ordinating the

implementation of the country's ongoing financial sector

reform programme.

The Department is expected to play a catalytic role in

the development of financial markets in the country with

special emphasis on the development of the debt market. The

following functions have been assigned to the Department:

• Identifying areas where institutional support is needed

for the development of money and capital markets

and preparing a time bound action plan for the

implementation of such reforms.

• Implementing appropriate measures to establish

institutions that are identified as crucial to the

development of money and capital markets on a

priority basis and ensuring that these institutions

function properly to achieve the objectives assigned

to them.

• Identifying new financial instruments that will

promote healthy money and capital markets.

• Identifying the constraints affecting the rapid

development of money and capital markets and

preparing a time bound programme to eliminate such

.constraints.

• Identifying fiscal incentives necessary for the

development of money and capital markets.

• Co-ordinating with other relevant agencies with a

view to achieving the objectives of the Central Bank

in the development of money and capital markets.

• Working closely with other agencies concerned with

the capital market with a view to developing a

modern "state of the art" technology.

• Monitoring developments in financial markets on a

regular basis and taking appropriate measures when

adverse developments are observed.

• Co-ordinating the functions of the existing Financial

Sector Reform Committee.

During the period under review, the Department was engaged in a number of activities. One of the main activities of the Department was coordinating the implementation of financial sector reform programme and monitoring the progress on behalf of the Financial Sector Reform Committee (FSRC). The FSRC was reconstituted by the Secretary to the Treasury in January 1997, with the Governor, Central Bank as the Chairman. The FSRC which is responsible for monitoring the country's financial sector reform programme, is composed of senior officials from the Ministry of Finance (Secretary to the Treasury and the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury are members) and the Central Bank. The FSRC

( X V )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

is assisted by three sub-committees in its tasks — the FSRC

Sub Committee on Bank Supervision, the FSRC Sub-

Committee on Regulatory Reforms and Financial Markets

and the FSRC Sub-Committee on the Central Bank.

Several legislative reforms were in the pipeline during

the year. Among them was the new Insurance Bill which

will provide for an autonomous regulatory and supervisory

authority for the insurance industry. The Bill is expected

to be presented to Parliament in early 1998. During the

year, the FSRC approved the Finance Leasing Bill and

amendments to the National Savings Bank (NSB) Act. The

Central Bank was involved in drafting the Finance Leasing

Bill which will empower the Bank to regulate and supervise

the leasing industry. The Finance Leasing Bill and the

amendments to the NSB Act were submitted to the Ministry

of Finance and are expected to be submitted to Parliament

in 1998.

The Department also co-ordinated the work relating to

the establishment of Credit Rating Agency (CRA) in Sri

Lanka. In this respect, the Department was involved in

determining the capital and ownership structure of the CRA

and in identifying a suitable foreign technical partner.

Multilateral agencies such as the International Finance

Corporation and the Asian Development Bank are also

expected to invest in the CRA, which is scheduled to be

established in 1998. .

The Department was also involved in preparing a

Memorandum of Understanding .(MOU) between the

Government and the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank

x improve the efficiency, profitability and financial

undness of the banks. The MOUs seek to improve the

orporate governance of the banks by providing them with

oerational autonomy and will prescribe certain performance

•gets which the banks will be required to achieve. The

40Us will be signed in early 1998.

The Department was also engaged in :

(a) Preparing offers of commitments for the World

Trade Organization negotiations on trade in

financial services which were concluded in

December 1997.

(b) liaising with international donor agencies on

technical assistance projects with a view to utilising

such assistance.

(c) preparing information brochures for the public on

Treasury bills, Treasury bonds and other

Government securities, which will be published in

1998.

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE

The activities of the Development Finance Department

expanded in 1997. A new credit guarantee scheme entitled

Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project (SMAP)

came into operation with effect from 9 September 1997. The

Plantation Reform Project (PRP), which became effective in

the second half of 1996, expanded rapidly during 1997

showing a very high level of performance both in respect

of loan approvals and disbursements. The Department also

continued to conduct inspection of projects for which credit

guarantees have been provided by the Central Bank.

Current Credit Schemes

Plantation Reform Project (PRP)

In May 1996, The Asian Development Bank (ADB)

approved US dollars 40 million as the credit component of

a loan of US dollars 60 million for capital development of

the privatised regional plantation companies. In December of

the same year, the Overseas Economic Co-orporation Fund

(OECF) of Japan agreed to provide a loan of Japanese yen

4,075 million (equivalent of US dollars 40 million) as

additional funds for the same purpose. As the Apex Lender

and Credit Guarantor of the PRP credit scheme, the'

Development Finance Department of the Central Bank had

approved loans amounting to Rs. 426 million in 1996. In

comparison, the loan approvals in 1997 increased by 92 per

cent to reach Rs. 818 million. Loan disbursements which

were only Rs. 57.9 million in 1996 increased to Rs. 519.2

million in 1997. According to the purpose-wise classification

of PRP loans which is shown in Table II-7, loans amounting

to Rs.347.7 million (42 per cent) were approved for

processing, improvement and pollution control, while loans

amounting to Rs. 308.5 million (38 per cent) were approved

for tree, crop development. The value of loans approved for

purchase of service vehicles and equipment amounted to

Rs.161.9 million (20. per cent).

and DFCC Bank (DFCCB) and two commercial banks, i.e.

Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. (CBC) and Bank of

Ceylon (BOC) participated in the loan scheme. Further, in

1997 DFCCB became the second largest participating

financial institution approving 42 per cent of all loans.

Details of loan approvals, disbursements and the credit

guarantee liability of the Central Bank are given in Table

II-8. As shown in the Table, credit guarantee liability under

the PRP credit guarantee scheme which stood at Rs. 40.5

million at the end of 1996 increased to Rs.337.8 million as

at end December 1997. The. total premium collection as at

Housing Guarantee Low Income Shelter Programme - Phase IV

The refinancing of loans under the Housing Guarantee Low Income Shelter Programme (HGLISP) - Phase IV, which commenced in July 1992 continued to operate in 1997. The Central Bank, which functions as the Apex Lender of HGLISP, disbursed funds borrowed by the Government of Sri Lanka under the United States Government Housing Loan Guarantee Programme - Phase IV, to refinance the lending of PCIs, designated as Sub Apex Lenders (SAL), who have entered into agreements with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka under the HGLISP.

The HGLISP scheme was initially implemented using

an advance of Rs.150 million provided by the Ministry of

Finance. However, in October 1994, a loan of US dollars.

10 million, being the first tranche of a loan of US dollars

25 million was made available to the scheme. In September

1997, the. second tranche of US dollars 15 million was made

available and consequently, during September-December

1997, the Central Bank was able to disburse Rs.195 million.

The cumulative approvals and disbursements from 1992 to

(XVII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

1997 show that while a sum of Rs.l,1-42 million had been

approved, Rs.832 million had been disbursed. More details

HGLISP was subjected to a structural change in 1997 due to the new Programme Delivery Plan (PDP) agreed for the second tranche of this loan scheme in 1996. According to the new PDP, only the loans which have been secured by mortgages are eligible for funding and hence, only the long-term lending institutions could participate in the credit scheme in 1997.

The largest proportion of borrowers of HGLISP came from the rural sector as can be seen from the data for 1996 and 1997. According to the purpose-wise classification of loans, in 1997 over 99 per cent had been approved for land acquisition. Of loans approved in 1997, the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) approved 95 per

cent and the rest were approved by the State Mortgage and

Investment Bank (SMIB). The maturity pattern of loans

under this scheme indicates that only 3 per cent of new loans

have been granted for periods 5 to 10 years and over 96 per

cent have been granted for periods of 10 to 15 years.

Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project

The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

in May 1997, approved a new credit guarantee scheme

named Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project

(SMAP) which is being refinanced by the National

Development Bank (NDB) with the rupee proceeds of loans

amounting to US dollars 55 million jointly raised from

foreign commercial sources and the ADB. Under this credit

guarantee scheme, Central Bank would provide SMAP credit

guarantee to PCIs which have concluded participating

agreements with the NDB. The SMAP credit guarantee

scheme became operational in September 1997 with,the issue

of the Central Bank's Operating Instructions No. CB/DF/

SMAP(97) on 22 September 1997. During the last quarter

of 1997, eight credit guarantee applications amounting to

Rs.5.0 million were approved under the SMAP.

Concluded Credit Schemes

A summary in respect of concluded credit guarantee

schemes, as at 31 December 1997, is given in Table II-12.

Table 11-13 shows an industry-wise classification of projects

financed under SMI schemes. Some of the highlights of the

concluded credit guarantee schemes are as follows:

Small Scale Industries Scheme (SSI)

At the end of 1997, only eight loans amounting to Rs.

0.4 million and involving a total guarantee commitment of

Rs.0.3 million were outstanding.

been granted under the BPL Scheme. A total of 282 loans

amounting to Rs.52.9 million remained outstanding by the

end of 1997.

Investment of Guarantee Funds

The total value of investments of SMI, BPL and PRP

guarantee funds inclusive of funds advanced by the Central

Bank and premium collections invested in Treasury Bills in

1997 amounted to Rs. 1448.0 million. The total value of

interest income from the investments during the year was

Rs.180.5 million.

Follow-Up and Inspection of Projects

The programme of project inspection of the Department covering SMI loans in arrears and guarantee claims of PCIs continued in 1997. More active follow-up work by the Department has contributed to an improvement in recovery and the rehabilitation of several sick industries. A total of 200 projects was inspected during 1997 in contrast to 65 projects in 1996. Table II-14 gives a summary of the outcome of follow-up project inspections carried out during 1996 and 1997.

(i) Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP)

The Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP) which

was successfully concluded in 1995, continued to re-cycle

its loan recoveries by extending new loans for the purposes

approved under the Project. The Central Bank continued to

monitor and administer recoveries and re-cycling of loans

by PCIs under the ARP Credit Scheme.

Of the total loans amounting to Rs.771.1 million

granted under the ARP, Rs.409.4 million had been

recovered by PCIs as at 30 June 1997. The average

recovery rate of all PCIs stood at 67.4 per cent. The PCI

branches located in the districts of the Northern and Eastern

provinces have reported a low rate of recovery due to their

inability to meet and communicate with the defaulting sub-

borrowers. Under the arrangement for re-cycling the

recoveries, PCIs have granted 1,894 loans amounting to

Rs.61.5 million and, of this, Rs.29.8 million had'already

been recovered as at 30 June 1997.

(ii) The Small Holder Tea Development Project (SHTDP)

The Small Holder Tea Development Project funded by

the ADB which commenced operations in 1989 was

terminated in December 1997. The project aimed at

increasing production and export of tea by small-holders,

improving the quality and productivity of tea factories,

increasing income and employment opportunities in rural

areas and improving the Government's capability of

supporting tea small holders.

The progress of the credit scheme in the initial years

was slow due to a number of factors such as cumbersome

procedures, difficulties in finding acceptable collateral, and

the low margins due to the depressed tea prices in the world

market. However, after a number of corrective measures

were put in place, the project performance improved

considerably since 1994. Consequently, the total allocation

of US dollars 12.3 million (Rs.687 million approximately)

for the credit component was fully committed for

disbursement as credit by PCIs by the early part of 1997.

At end 1997, the cumulative loan approvals and

disbursements by PCIs amounted to Rs.847.7 million and

Rs.714.5 million, respectively.

During the year under review, loans to a value of

Rs.96.5 million were approved by PCIs. The disbursements,

which included previously approved loans, amounted to

Rs.l74.8 million. Loans granted for field development (new

planting and replanting) amounted to Rs.34.5 million, while

those for nursery development and factory development

amounted to Rs.6.5 million and Rs. 133.8 million,

respectively. The cumulative refinance by the CBSL in

respect of loans disbursed by PCIs amounted to Rs.536

million at end 1997. Steps were also taken to expedite the

loan disbursements by PCIs so as to ensure full utilisation

of the remaining Rs.200 million before the loan is closed

in December 1998.

To facilitate this, the ADB has agreed to fund the

credit component until end 1998, though the loan is

officially closed in December 1997.

PCIs not only managed to fully utilise loan funds, but

also maintained a satisfactory recovery rate of 85 per cent

under the Project. In view of this satisfactory performance,

the ADB has expressed willingness to.consider the

extension of a second line of credit for the small holder

tea sector- A technical appraisal for the proposed second

project has been fielded by the ADB. In order to ensure

the continuity of the loan scheme until the second Project

comes into operation, the PCIs have agreed to continue

lending to tea small holders out of their own funds. This

interim arrangement has been facilitated by the Tea Small

Holders Development Authority (TSHDA) by paying an

interest subsidy of 4 percentage points.out of cess funds

to enable PCIs to grant loans at 14 percent per annum to

borrowers. This scheme came into operation from

November, 1997.

(iii) Perennial Crops Development Project (PCDP)

The PCDP funded by the ADB commenced operations

in 1990 and was closed in December 1997 as scheduled.

The credit scheme was designed to provide medium-term

credit facilities to farmers at concessionary rates for

promoting the production and the commercialisation of

perennial crops, particularly minor export crops and fruit

crops. The Project also had as its objectives the promotion

of the use of modern technology, handling and processing

of perennial crops economically and productively.

The disbursement of loans under the PCDP accelerated

in 1997 mainly due to the new vigour shown by all

agencies involved in the Project in the face of its scheduled

termination by end 1997. Accordingly, the cumulative loan

approvals and disbursements upto end 1997 amounted to

Rs.824 million and Rs.642 million, respectively. The total

refinance granted by the Bank to PCIs in respect of the

above loans amounted to Rs.508.2 million at the end of

1997. The physical achievements in terms of both the area

cultivated and the sub-loans approved have exceeded the

targets set at the time of the design of the Project in 1988.

In view of the satisfactory progress achieved by the

Project, the ADB has agreed to finance a Second Perennial

(XXII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Crops Development Project with a loan facility of SDR

14.743 million. The loan negotiations by the Government

with the ADB were successfully completed in September

1997 and the new Project is scheduled to commence

operations from the beginning of 1998. In the new Project

too, the Central Bank will function as the executing agency

for the credit component.

(iv) Southern. Province Rural Development Project (SPRDP)

The SPRDP, funded by the ADB, began operations in

1992 with the objective of raising the income and quality

of life of people in the Southern Province by undertaking

infrastructural development and providing credit facilities to

generate income and employment opportunities in the

project area. The Central Bank functions as the executing

agency for the credit component of the project which has

a credit allocation,of SDR 6.4 million (approximately

Rs.450 million). The Development Finance Corporation of

Ceylon Bank (DFCC) and the three RRDBs at Galle,

Matara and Hambantota functioned as PCIs from the

inception of the Project. During the year, the National

Development Bank (NDB) was also admitted as a PCI

under this credit scheme. All these PCIs are assisted by a

Project Office set up in the province by the Southern

Province Provincial Council. Under the project, refinance is

provided by the Bank for financing small/medium scale

industries located at Charley Mount Industrial Estate in

Weligama and other small/medium scale rural enterprises in

the Southern Province. The on-lending rate and the refinance

rate under the project remained unchanged at 14 per cent

and 6 per cent per annum, respectively, during 1997.

During the year under review, PCIs granted 432 loans amounting to Rs.67.7 million recording a cumulative disbursement of Rs.212 million at the end of the year. A sum of Rs.60.7 million in respect of 432 loans was granted by the Bank by way- of refinance to PCIs during 1997. Accordingly, the cumulative refinance as at end 1997 amounted to Rs.187.8 million in respect of 5341 loans.

(v) North-Western Province Water Resources Development Project (NWP-WRDP)

The ADB funded North Western Province Water

Resources Development Project Credit Scheme completed its

fourth year in 1997. The credit component of the project,

amounting to SDR 1.6 million (approximately Rs. 100

million), consists of three main sub-components, viz., Agro-

well Construction, Lift Irrigation Sub-projects and Income

Generating Self-employment Projects for Rural Women in

the Northwestern Province. The Puttalam and Kurunegala

Regional Rural Development Banks and Hatton National

Bank participated in the project from its inception as PCIs,

while People's Bank and Bank of Ceylon joined the credit

scheme in 1996.

During the year under review, the Central Bank wjth

the approval of the ADB adopted a number of measures to

improve the performance of the credit scheme. These include

the enhancement of the upper limits of the loans for agro-

wells and self-employment for rural women to Rs.50,000;

extension of Rs.60,000 for construction of overhead water

tanks under the Lift Irrigation Scheme; extensiion of a second

loan for women who have successfully completed the first

loan, upto a maximum of Rs.70,000; and identification of

women beneficiaries through farmer organisations.

At the end of 1997, PCIs had disbursed Rs.22.81

million for the construction of 725 agro-wells and Rs.14.2

million for 1,031 self-employment sub-projects for women'

in the Northwestern Province. The Lift Irrigation Projects,

which were activated in 1997, funded 41 schemes at a cost

of Rs.1.1 million. The Central Bank has granted Rs.29.2

million as refinance to all PCIs under this project upto end

1997.

(vi) North Central Province - ADB Funded Rural Development Project and IFAD Funded Participatory Rural Development Project

The Government of Sri Lanka has signed two loan agreements with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the implementation of two poverty alleviation projects, viz. North Central Province Participatory Rural Development Project (NCP-PRDP) and North Central Province Rural Development Project (NCP-RDP), respectively. NCP-PRDP became effective from 1996, while the NCP-RDP was inaugurated in 1997.The broad objectives of both projects are to alleviate poverty and improve productivity of farmers through development of infrastructure and provision of credit facilities in the districts of the North Central Province.

The Central Bank is the apex co-ordinating agency for

the credit component of both these projects. The credit

component of the IFAD/NCP-PRDP was to be implemented

utilising the funds of the National Development Trust Fund

(NDTF). However, this arrangement did not materialise as

envisaged, since the failure of the Partner Organisations

which were to function at the grassroots level to fulfill the

conditions stipulated by the NDTF and the subsequent

termination of the operation of the NDTF. It was, therefore,

decided to amalgamate the credit component of the NCP-

PRDP with the ADB/NCP-RDP of which the credit

component was funded by PCIs out of their own funds

(XXIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

supported by the payment of a service fee of 2 per cent on

the portfolio and provision of other support services. The

basic ground work to implement the credit component of

both projects with the participation of Bank of Ceylon,

People's Bank, Hatton National Bank and Seylan Bank was

completed, by the end of 1997 and the credit scheme is

expected to get off the ground in early 1998. .

(vii) Small Farmers and the Landless Credit Project (SFLCP)

The SFLCP, for which the Bank functions as the

executing agency, was completed in December 1997 as

originally scheduled after achieving the targets set for the

Project at the design stage. This Project, inaugurated in 1990

with funding provided by IFAD (a loan of US dollars 6.7

million), CIDA (a grant of US dollars 6.6 million) and the

Government of Sri Lanka (a contribution by the Bank

amounting to US dollars 4.1 million) as a pilot poverty

alleviation project, was implemented in the four selected

districts of Galle, Matara, Kandy and Puttalam. The Project

relies on linkage and the self-help group (SHG) concept as

its methodology in reaching the target groups.

At end 1997, the Project had covered 2274 villages in

the four districts under reference, forming 8,203 self-help

groups as the vehicle for providing assistance to the project

beneficiaries. The total number of beneficiaries in these

groups stood at 49,746, well above the target of 32,000 set

in the project design. A noteworthy feature in the Project

has been the active and predominant participation of women

borrowers numbering 26,832 or 67 per cent of the total

beneficiaries. As at the end of the year, a sum of Rs.363

million had been advanced as micro loans to 40,275

borrowers to enable them to undertake income generating

self-employment activities. The average size of a loan

amounted to Rs.9,000 while the Project had consistently

maintained a recovery rate of over 91 per cent.

A sample survey conducted by the Bank in June 1997

on the benefit monitoring and project performance revealed

that about 80 per cent of beneficiaries had crossed the

poverty line through Project activities. However, with the

closing of the Project by end 1997, it was necessary to

ensure the sustainability of the beneficiaries through

continued investment in income generating activities. To

achieve this objective, the Bank made arrangements to

continue with project activities for a further period of 20

years by continuing to engage the RRDB in the district as

the banker to the Project and utilising the loan recoveries,

for recycling. These loan recoveries which had been credited

to a special Project Revolving Fund, amounted to Rs.256.2

million at end 1997.

Since the small self-help groups that had been formed as the vehicle for delivering credit and other support services to project beneficiaries had come of age by the end of the year, there was a necessity for the formalisation of these groups into larger voluntary associations to function as the link between the beneficiaries and the RRDBs. Hence, several groups operating in a village were amalgamated into SFLC Development Societies (ISURU SANVARDENA SAMITHI) which were registered with the Registrar of Companies as corporate bodies with limited liability under the Societies Ordinance. At the end of 1997, 110 such limited liability societies had been formed.

In order to share the experience which the Bank has gathered through the SFLC Project, a video documentary titled "Isuru: The Crossing" and a book of case studies in Sinhala titled "Isuru ManPethe Piyawara Thabuwo" were released by the Bank during the year. In addition, several other video documentaries covering fields such as the empowerment of women, technology transfer, the concept of self-help groups and poverty alleviation are presently under production by the Bank.

(viii) Food and Nutrition Promotion Credit Scheme

A new credit scheme titled Food and Nutrition

Promotion Credit Scheme was inaugurated in 1997 by the

Bank at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and

Lands. For implementation of the credit scheme, the

Government allocated a sum of Rs.284 million out of the

counterpart funds of the Japanese Food Production Grant

received by the Government. The Bank formulated the credit

scheme and implemented it through the lending banks. This

credit scheme has been introduced with a view to'

implementing a comprehensive programme for the

improvement of food production and food processing

techniques in the country.

Under the scheme, credit facilities will be provided to

farmer organisations/ co-operatives, individual farmers and

rural organisations with the objective of restructuring the

agricultural sector and improving the country's food

production by encouraging financial institutions to channel

credit through farmer organisations/rural organisations/co-

operatives/Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies as a way

of implementing a cost-effective credit delivery mechanism

for agriculture. The scheme is also intended to encourage

projects capable of introducing new agririndustries and

improving productivity through provision of storage facilities

with capacity for preserving large quantities of food crops

to minimise wastage and maintenance of buffer stocks to be

utilised during the offTharvesting period.

Credit will be provided through Bank of Ceylon,

People's Bank, Hatton National Bank, Sampath Bank, Seylan

Bank and the Commercial Bank at an interest rate of 10 per

( X X I V )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997.

cent per annum . The lending banks will provide bulk loans

to partner organisations at an interest rate of 6 per' cent per

annum for on-lending to their members at 10 per cent per

annum.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Lands through their

provincial offices will assist in the provision of technical

know-how and support facilities to eligible farmers and co­

ordinate scheme with PCIs at the ground level.

(ix) Kegalle District Integrated Rural (Revolving Fund) Project

The Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development

Project which was implemented during 1986-95, provided for

the re-cycling of loan recoveries for similar purposes through

a Revolving Fund Credit Scheme. Accordingly, the Central

Bank, with the collaboration of the Regional Development

Division of the Ministry of Plan Implementation took action

in 1997 to establish a Revolving Fund Credit Scheme out

of the cumulative loan recoveries. The credit disbursements

under this arrangement commenced in mid 1997 after the

Central Bank signed subsidiary loan agreements with PCIs,

viz., Kegalle Regional Rural Development Bank, Bank of

Ceylon and the People's Bank.

Under the credit scheme, loans upto a maximum of

Rs.250,000 are granted to eligible borrowers at an interest

rate of 10 per cent per annum to enable them to undertake

self-employment economic activities. The borrowers are

introduced to PCIs by specially trained Business

Development Officers who operate on a fee based system.

As at end 1997, 15 such officers had been attached to the

branches of the relevant PCIs.

After the Project commenced operations in mid 1997, 550 loans to a value of Rs.30 million were approved by PCIs upto the end of the year. Of this, a sum of Rs.22 million had been disbursed to borrowers. Refinance to a value of Rs.10.5 million had been released by the Bank on such disbursements.

(x) Surathura Programme - Self Employment Promotion Through Micro Enterprise Credit

The Surathura Programme, which was inaugurated by

the Government in September 1996, provides micro finance

to the unemployed, especially the educated youth, to enable

them to undertake income generating self-employment

activities. The Project which is implemented by the Central

Bank is being operated through the Bank of Ceylon, People's

Bank and the Hatton National Bank which function as PCIs.

Under the Scheme, the Government'allocated a sum of

Rs. 350 million in the Budget of 1997 to provide refinance

to PCIs. This allocation was fully utilised by PCIs by the

end of the third quarter of the year providing 9,009 loans

to eligible borrowers. Of these loans, small industries (48

per cent), and trade based projects (38 per cent), accounted

for the bulk. The balance 14 per cent had been extended

to agricultural, livestock and fisheries sector projects.

In view of the full utilisation of the funds by PCIs,

the Government decided to continue the Project in Phase

II, with a new design. Under Phase II, PCIs agreed to fund

the credit scheme out of their own resources, but to lend

to the borrowers at 10 per cent per annum and they were

paid an interest subsidy of 10 percentage points.

Under Phase II, 10,000 loans for a value of Rs.500

million are planned to be disbursed to the target borrowers

to facilitate them to undertake self-employment projects.

In order to assess the status of loan utilisation under

Surathura Phase I, the Bank conducted an island-wide

sample survey in July, 1997. The survey revealed that 85

per cent of the borrowers had effectively utilised the funds

for the projects for which they had obtained loans.

(xi) Relief Scheme to Shrimp Farmers

The shrimp farming industry, a rising foreign exchange earner, continued to suffer from the white spot disease which affected it adversely in 1996. A relief package was introduced by lending banks to this industry in 1996 at the instigation of the Central Bank to facilitate fast recovery and rehabilitation of the affected ponds. The relief package included a loan moratorium for 15 months, rescheduling of the outstanding loans at an interest rate of 5 per cent per annum, extension of new loans at the prevailing average prime lending rate, quick repayment of the outstanding loans from the new harvests and technical assistance from the National Aquatic Resources Agency (NARA) for the rehabilitation of ponds. While about a half of the farmers utilised this facility, it was felt by mid 1997, that the rehabilitation took longer than originally planned. Hence, at the request of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, the Central Bank persuaded the lending banks to continue the relief package for a further period. Accordingly, the moratorium was extended by a further period of 8 months from September 1997 at an interest rate of 5 per cent per annum.

(xii) Coconut Development Loan Scheme

The Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB), in consultation

with the Central Bank and the lending banks, has introduced

a new credit scheme with the objective of increasing

coconut production and productivity of coconut lands,

( X X V )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

enhancing farm income and the standard of living of

coconut farmers and,increasing employment opportunities in

the coconut sector. The subsidy scheme, which had been

implemented by the BoaTd earlier, was replaced by the

credit scheme which was a departure from the subsidy based

development strategies that were being adopted earlier. The

Central Bank plays an advisory role to CCB in the

implementation of the loan scheme.

The loan scheme will initially be implemented in the

major coconut growing regions, as pilot projects, covering

the Gampaha, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Hambantota and

Moneragala Districts. Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank,

Hatton National Bank, Kurunegala RRDB, Thrift and Credit

Co-operative Societies and the Sri Lanka Coconut

Producers' Co-operative Societies Union will participate in

the scheme.

Loans will be provided for new planting/replanting of

coconut,for both inter-cropping arid as a mono crop.

' The lending banks will provide loans to borrowers

using the banks' own funds at an interest rate not exceeding

18 per cent per annum for a period of 5 years including

one year's grace period. An interest rebate will be paid by

the Coconut Cultivation Board out of cess funds directly to

the borrowers, at the rate of 100 per cent in the first year

and 50 per cent in each of the subsequent four years to

those who have successfully followed the recommended

agricultural practices as agreed in the farm plan and the

cash flow budget.

Approximately Rs.672 million will be provided by the lending banks in the next five years to develop an extent of 17,500 acres of coconut land. The extent financed per individual fanner will be within the range 1/2 - 5 acres per year.

RURAL BANKING AND STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

During the year 1997, the Rural Banking and Staff

Training College (RB&STC) conducted 89 training courses

for 2,384 persons representing 1,258 small scale

entrepreneurs and self employed persons, 357 Central Bank

employees, 250 Commercial Bank employees, 306 Regional

Rural Development Bank (RRDB) employees and 213

employees from other institutions. Of the 89 training courses

49 were conducted at the RB&STC and the balance at

outstation venues.

Of the 49 training courses conducted at the RB&STC,

11 programmes were exclusively for RRDB employees.

Lending on pledge of jewellery, collateral and related legal

procedures for lending, accounting, internal auditing, project

appraisal and management were the main areas of training'

provided to the RRDBs. There were 13 computer training

courses designed to train. Central Bank officers on personal

computer applications, Marketing of bank services, financial

sector reforms, effective loan management, investment and

merchant banking, team work for quality, forex operations,

managing change, fund management, strategic planning,

commercial banking operations and practices, living long

after retirement, managing for excellence, national economic

management, enhancing management control and

profitability, resource allocation and development, better

report writing and managing risk were the main areas

covered under other training programmes conducted at the

college.

Training courses conducted in the outstations were

mainly on entrepreneurship development, micro-enterprise

management and leadership development. These training

programmes were conducted at district level in Matara.

Galle, Kandy and Puttalam under the aegis of the Small

Farmers and Landless Credit Project. Two special training

programmes were conducted on requests made by the TEAM

Project of CARE International and the Integrated Rural

Development Project in Kegalle to train field officers/

managers of the Partner Organisation of the TEAM Project

and the business development consultants and regional co­

ordinators of the Integrated Rural Development Project.

The Self Access Centre (SAC) for English Language

for Central Bank officers commenced its courses in July

1997 after a temporary setback consequent to the 1996

tragedy. During the second half of 1997, 96 Central Bank

officers availed themselves of the facilities in the SAC. To

supplement SAC facilities, classes were also held to improve

skills in oral communication and report writing during this

period.

The RB&STC in association with the Rural Credit Department, co-ordinated the Comparative Rural Study on Models for Linking Banks with Self-help Groups for the members of the Asia Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Association (APR AC A).

The RB&STC held its 16th Anniversary Lecture on the

topic 'What more do we know about Economic Growth"

which was delivered by Dr. G. Uswatte-Aratchi, Executive

Vice Chainnan, Marga Institute.

EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND

In terms of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) Act. the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is vested with the responsiblity of receiving contributions, surcharges and income from investments, maintaining proper

(XXVI)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

accounts of registered employers and the individual members of the Fund and also effecting refund of benefits to its members. These activities were carried out in close co­operation with the Employees' Provident Fund Division of the Department of Labour which attends to the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the EPF Act.

Since the disruption of the computer data-base and the destruction of a bulk of the documents in 1996, the reconstruction and updating of the database relating to EPF member accounts have been done using newly developed computer software on the new IBM AS 400.

The annual statements of all member accounts in respect

of the years 1994 and 1995, the preparation of which was

hampered consequent on the bomb blast, were issued in

1997.

Contributions

According to provisional data, the contributions received

by the Fund during 1997 amounted to Rs. 9.8 billion as

against Rs. 9.3 billion in 1996. This represents an increase

of 5 per cent over the level of contributions received during

the previous year.

The EPF contributions were collected by the EPF

Department centrally in Colombo since its inception. Since

April 1997, the two state banks, viz, Bank of Ceylon and

People's Bank, at which the EPF accounts were opened,

commenced collecting EPF contributions from employers.

This arrangement obviated the need for employers to send

the remittances to the EPF Department, and enabled them

to pay their contributions conveniently through a bank branch

of their choice.

Members' Balances

Members' balances as at 31 December 1997 before

allocation of interest for the year under review have been

estimated at approximately Rs. 104 billion, which is an

increase of about Rs. 17 billion or 20 per cent over the level

of 1996.

Investment

During the year under review, the Fund invested its

excess monies in government securities, Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds. The total investments held by the Fund as

at 31 December 1997 amounted to Rs. 137.6 billion, which

is an increase of Rs. 21.6 billion over the level at end 1996.

Income Received from Investments and Tax Paid

With the withdrawal in 1989 of the exemption from

income tax granted to the EPF, the liability for income tax

on its investment income for the year 1997 amounted to

Rs. 1.6 billion.

In 1997 the income received from investments

amounted to Rs. 18.2 billion as against Rs. 15.8 billion in

1996.

Refunds

The total sum paid out by way of refund of EPF

benefits to members during 1997 amounted to Rs. 4.6 billion

as against Rs.3.5 billion in 1996. This is an increase of 31.4

per cent over the previous year. During the period under

review, 61,196 claims for refund of benefits were paid out

as against 56,536 claims disposed of in 1996. The payment

of refunds continued to be made through the Sri Lanka Inter­

bank Payments System (SLIPS).

EPF Housing Loan Scheme

During the period under review, the EPF Department

had processed and despatched a total of 6,057 applications

for certification of balances to the respective labour offices.

Other Activities

A seminar for software developers was conducted in

May 1997 to lay the ground work for the modernisation of

the EPF.

During the period under review, a committee comprising of officials of the Labour Department and the Central Bank was set up by the Minister of Labour to make recommendations to improve efficiency and modernise the operations of the Fund. The Committee, which met several times during the year, discussed certain proposals towards achieving these ends. The final report is in draft form.

EXCHANGE CONTROL

There were no major changes during 1997 in exchange

control policy except in the scheme of foreign currency loans

to exporters, which was relaxed further. Granting of

approvals for capital account transactions, monitoring of

current account transactions, issuing of licences to freight

forwarders, renewing licences issued to money changers,

hoteliers, jewellery shop owners and others who are

permitted to accept foreign currency against services

provided by them to foreigners and conducting investigations

into violations of the provisions of the Exchange Control

Act, preparation of reports on exchange arrangements and

restrictions, disclosing information to public, local and

international organisations on exchange control regulations

(XXVII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

relating to various foreign exchange transactions are some

of the important activities that were carried out during the

period under review. The Department was also engaged in

clearing import applications referred by the Sri Lanka

Customs in terms of Government Gazette Notification No.

915/15 dated 21 March 1996 outlining the procedure relating

to import of goods and services.

Capital Account Transactions

(a) Investments Abroad

Investments abroad by Sri Lankan companies were

permitted on a case by case basis with the approval of the

Minister of Finance and Planning. These applications were

to establish a jewellery shop at Forte Grand Hotel in Dubai,

a plastic water flow cohtrol equipment manufacturing unit

at Coimbatore, India, a state of the art lingerie manufacturing

plant in South India and to purchase a company in Poland

to set up a production plant to process and pack tea under

the brand name "Dilma'\

(b) Foreign Currency Loans to Exporters

A significant change in the policy with regard to foreign

currency loans to exporters was made, in 1997 consequent

to a proposal announced in the Government Budget for 1997.

The new arrangement which came into force on 3 January

1997 provided for the grant of loans in foreign exchange

from funds available in the Domestic Banking Units (DBU)

as well as Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBU) of

commercial banks to meet the working capital and fixed

capital requirements of the export companies without any

restriction on the duration of such loans. Conversion of rupee

funds to effect settlement of the loans was strictly prohibited.

Previously,-foreign currency loans were restricted only for

the purpose of importing foreign inputs required to execute

export orders.

(c) Foreign Loans

During 1997, several applications to borrow from

international financial institutions were approved on an

exceptional basis by the Exchange Control Department.

(d) Other Capital Account Transactions/ Business Approved by the Department

(a) Share transactions outside provisions in the

Government Gazette Notification No. 721/4 of 29

June 1992.

(b) Share issues to non residents against funds not

channelled through the Share Investment External

Rupee Accounts (SIERA).

(c) Share issues to non residents against value of

machinery imported to Sri Lanka on no foreign

exchange involved basis.

(d) Debenture issues to foreigners by resident

companies.

(e) Remittances relating to projects by foreign

contractors.

(f) Remittances of sale proceeds of. shares purchased

prior to the implementafion of the new procedure

relating to share purchases by non-residents.

(g) Repayment of project loans by Government institutions.

(h) Activities relating to foreign currency denominated financial instruments.

(i) Loans and overdrafts to foreign controlled

companies from commercial banks and other

lending institutions in Sri Lanka.

(j) Opening of special foreign currency accounts,

special rupee accounts, Resident Guest Foreign

Currency Accounts (RGFCA) and Resident Guest

Rupee Current Accounts (RGRCA).

(k) Purchase of assets of non-residents.

(1) Issue of foreign currency denominated leases to

BOI companies which are fully exempted from

Exchange Control provisions.

(m) Foreign bank guarantees, performance bonds and

advance bonds for international contracts.

(e) Capital Transfers on Migration

During 1997, several applications from resident Sri Lankans who have obtained emigrant visas/permanent resident status in other countries, for the transfer of capital funds were approved by the Department. In addition, approvals were given for the disposal of funds belonging to deceased estates by emigrants, repatriation of assets by emigrants and remittances out of blocked funds.

(f) Monitoring of Current International Transactions

The Department continued to monitor inflows and

outflows of foreign exchange pertaining to current

international transactions on the basis of returns furnisehd by

(XXVIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

the commercial banks. The credits and debits to rupee

current accounts maintained by shipping and airline agents

as well as freignf forwarders on behalf of approximately 100

foreign principals were also monitored by examining cargo

manifests, debit notes, inward remittance memos, etc. It is

envisaged that the monitoring activities of the Department

would be further strengthened by the use of electornic

machinery.

(g) Investigations

The Department has conducted several investigations

into violations of the provisions of the Exchange Control Act

by some local and foreign, companies and individuals. These

investigations were mainly related to transfer/sale/purchase of

shares, investments abroad and conducting foreign exchange

transactions without the permission of the Exchange Control

Department.

PUBLIC DEBT

In terms of Section 113 of the Monetary Law Act, the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is entrusted with the

issuance, management and servicing of domestic debt and the

servicing of foreign debt of the Government of Sri Lanka

(GOSL). These activities were handled by the Public Debt

Department (PDD) of the CBSL. In fulfilling its

responsibilities the PDD continued to issue domestic debt

instruments namely Rupee Securities, Treasury bills,'Treasury

bonds and Treasury Certificates of Deposits (TCDs).

The PDD also handled the service payment of Tax

Reserve Certificates (TRCs) and debenture issues on behalf

of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB), the

National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) and the

Urban Development Authority (UDA).

Development Activities

The PDD took several initiatives with a view to further developing 'the domestic debt securities market. One such development activity was the steps takeri to strengthen the Primary Dealer System (PDS). Regular meetings with Primary Dealers (PDs) were organised by the PDD in order to maintain a continuous rapport between the Central Bank and PDs on current developments in the debt securities market. At these meetings it was possible to discuss issues of current interest and obtain the views of the primary dealers on these matters.

Information relating to trading activities of the PDs in

debt instruments, especially Treasury bills and Treasury

bonds, was collected and analysed regularly by the PDD.

Steps were taken by the PDD to publish the information thus

collected through the electronic media such as Reuters,

Internet etc. In order to improve public awareness of the

PDS, information was released regularly to the market in the

form of press releases through newspapers and news services

such as Reuters and Lanka Online Internet computer

network. A database was established using the information

collected from the PDs. These data were used to compute

performance indicators on individual PDs as well as the total

market. Information in summary form was released to the

PDs at one-to-one meetings that were held on a weekly basis

enabling dealers to evaluate their respective positions in

relation to the total market. The database was also used to

prepare the Annual Review of the PDS.

The CBSL encouraged the setting up of an association

to represent the PD community in order that matters of

common interest relating to their dealings in Government

debt securities be discussed. As a result of these efforts the

Primary Dealer Association (PDA) was established in June

1997. Several sub-committees have been formed in the PDA

to address different issues concerning the PDs.

The PDD formulated the procedures, guidelines and regulations for the implementation of the T-bond programme and developed in-house the necessary computer software for auctioning, issuing and servicing of Treasury bonds. The regulations thus formulated titled 'Registered Stocks and Securities (Treasury bonds) Regulations No.l of 1997' were gazetted on 20 February 1997. In terms of these regulations, the existing PDs for Treasury bills and Central Bank Securities (CBSs) were appointed PDs for Treasury bonds. Having finalised these arrangements, the PDD launched the issue of Treasury bonds in March 1997 and the first auction was held on 27 February 1997 for the first issue of Treasury bonds value dated 2 March 1997. During the year, the PDD also engaged in developing the modalities to improve the primary issue and trading of this instrument in the secondary market. The PDD also conducted two workshops for institutional investors on Treasury bonds on 3 April 1997 and 26 July 1997.

The PDD also made arrangements for early retirement

of 7 RSs amounting to Rs.16,000 million which were due

for compulsory repayment in 1999 and optional repayment

in 1998. These included 3 RSs amounting to Rs.6,000

million carrying a rate of interest of 15 per cent and 4 RSs

amounting to Rs.10,000 million carrying a rate of interest

of 16 per cent. The gazette order relating to the early

retirement of these RSs was issued on 23 September 1997.

In order to develop the debt securities market, the PDD obtained technical advice from two foreign consultants during the year. The PDs were given opportunities to discuss

(XXIX)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

matters relating to capital market development with these

consultants thus enabling them to present their views.

The reconstruction of the computer software and the

database on Public Debt that were destroyed in the bomb

blast in January 1996 was continued in 1997. The PDD

completed the issue of duplicates for Treasury bills destroyed

in the bomb blast and by mid 1997 maturity proceeds of all

duplicate Treasury bills had been fully paid.

The Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and

Management System (CS-DRMS) database which is currently

used at the PDD for recording and management of external

debt was upgraded from Version 6.1 to Version 7.1 in July

1997. The main advantage of the new version is the

connectivity of the database to spreadsheets in Windows/

DOS.

Operational Activities

Total outstanding gross public debt serviced by the PDD

as at end 1997 amounted to Rs.740,412 million. This

indicated an increase of Rs.49,708 million or 7.2 per cent

as compared with that of 1996. Total public debt outstanding

as at end 1997 consisted of Rs.364,561 million (49.2 percent)

of domestic debt and Rs.375,851 million (50.8 percent) of

foreign debt. The domestic component of the public debt

increased by Rs. 33,371 million or by 10.1. percent whilst

that of foreign debt rose by Rs.16,337 million or 4.5 per cent

over that of 1996. Table 11-17 shows the composition of

public debt serviced by the PDD.

Treasury Bills

Primary Market

Total Treasury bills outstanding as at end 1997 was Rs.

114,996 million as compared with Rs. 124,996 million as at

end 1996. This reduction was due to the retirement of

Rs.10,000 million out of the stock of Treasury bills held by

the CBSL in August 1997. There were no new issues of

Treasury bills during the year. The authorised limit of

Treasury bills remained unchanged at Rs. 125,000 million

during 1997.

The retirement of Rs. 10,000 million of Treasury bills

in August 1997 was made possible by the privatisation

proceeds of US dollars 225 million received by the

Government from the divesture of 35 per cent of the

holdings of Sri Lanka Telecom. The amount retired at Rs.

10,000 million included Rs.3,150 million of Treasury bills due to mature during 1997 and Rs.6,850 million of Treasury

bills due to mature during 1998. The direct total interest

savings from this retirement amounted to Rs. 516 million.

The Monetary Operations Unit (MOU) serviced by the

Public Debt, Banking and Economic Research departments

continued to determine the amounts of Treasury bills to be

offered at the weekly primary auctions and their maturity

distribution and any advanced reservations of Treasury bills

to the Central Bank. The MOU also determined the maturity

structure of Treasury bills purchased by the CBSL at primary

auctions.

Based on the review of performance of PDs during

1996, the Monetary Board decided to withdraw the PD status

of Five PDs and approved the appointment of two new PDs

on the recommendations made by the PDD. As a result, the

total number of PDs at end 1997 stood at 18, of which 11

were commercial banks and 7 were non-commercial banks.

Weekly one-to-one meetings with PDs were conducted

continuously by the PDD with a view to evaluating the

money and debt markets while discussing issues pertaining

to PD activities. In addition, weekly regular meetings with

all PDs commenced from July 1997.

Access to the weekly primary auction was confined to the PDs and institutional investors authorised by the CBSL. Total sales of Treasury bills at primary auctions amounted to Rs.210,887 million during 1997. The largest single category of buyers of Treasury bills at the primary market was commercial bank PDs who purchased Rs. 123,313 million or 58.4 per cent of total sales. The second largest category was the non-bank PDs who purchased 21.3 per cent of the total. Until May 1997 several institutions such as the National Co-operative Council (NCC) and Employees' Trust Fund (ETF) were allowed to bid directly at the primary auctions. These institutional investors, together with CBSL managed funds were responsible for 8.3 per cent of the bids accepted in 1997. Table II-18 shows the source wise distribution of bids accepted for 1997.

Of the total bids amounting to Rs. 318,258 million

received in 1997, 67.8 per cent were from commercial bank

PDs. The remaining 32.2 per cent were from non-bank PDs

(25.9 per cent) and others (6.3 per cent).

Of the Treasury bills outstanding as at end 1997, Rs.

53,334 million (46 per cent) was in respect of 12 month

maturities and Rs. 20,111 million (18 per cent) was in

respect of 6 month maturities. The balance 36 per cent or

Rs. 41,551 million constituted maturities of three months (26

per cent) and other maturities (10 per cent)..Other maturities

represent the stocks resulting from purchases by the CBSL.

The total number of physical scrips of Treasury bills, issued

during 1997 was 72,866 for all maturities.

The weighted average (w.a) yield rates for 3, 6 and 12 month Treasury bills fluctuated between 9.87 - 17.14, 10.09 - 17,03 and 10.17 - 17.11 per cent, respectively. The large spreads between the highest and the lowest rates during the year Were due to the sharp drop in the yield rates towards the end of 1997 from the high levels that prevailed at the beginning of the year. The annualised w.a yield rates by maturity with their overall averages are given in Table 11-19. The total interest commitment on account of Treasury bills issued during 1997 was Rs. 12,661 million showing a decrease of 31.6 per cent when compared with that of the previous year.

The minimum and maximum w.a yield rates of bids

received during the year 1997 were 9.67 and 17.25 per cent

considerably during 1997. A substantial amount of outright,

repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions took place

among the PDs and their customers. The total volume of

outright sales and purchases by the PDs amounted to Rs.95

billion and Rs. 28 billion, respectively during 1997. Trading

volume by the PDs in respect of repurchases and reverse

repurchases amounted to Rs.582 billion and Rs. 474 billion,

Treasury Bonds

A new medium and long-term coupon bearing

Government Debt Instrument in the form of Treasury bonds

(T-bonds) was issued by the CBSL on behalf, of the

Government of Sri Lanka commencing from March 1997.

Treasury bonds are issued under the provisions of the

Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance (RSSO) as

amended by Act No. 32 of 1995. During 1997 Treasury

bonds were issued at auctions held fortnightly.

During 1997, Rs. 10 billion of Treasury bonds were issued. Initially, the CBSL introduced Treasury bonds with a 2 year maturity and subsequently shifted to 3 year and 4 year maturities. During 1997, 18 issues, of which .13 were 2 year maturities, 2 were 3 year maturities and 3 were 4 year maturities, were made. Of the 10 billion of Treasury bonds issued, Rs. 7,500 million was in respect of 2 year maturities, Rs. 1000 million was in respect of 3 year maturities and RS. 1,500 million was in respect of 4 year maturities. The coupon rate was announced by the CBSL prior to each auction. In view of money market developments that exerted pressure on the interest rates, the coupon rate was reduced from 14 per cent per annum at the beginning to 11.5 per cent per annum at the end of the year. All auctions held during 1997 were over-subscribed and there were bids at par and at a premium at all but one auction. Of the total bids received during the year Rs. 14,216 million of bids were received at a premium, Rs. 9,135 million of bids were received at par and Rs. 4,898 million of bids were received at a discount. The bids received from institutional investors who were allowed to receive a weighted average yield to. maturity, amounted to Rs. 4,790 million. Table 11-22 presents information pertaining to primary issues of Treasury bonds.

. .Interest payments are made on surrender of coupons by the bond holders bi-annually through PDs to the PDD. Total interest payments on account of Treasury bonds amounted to Rs. 326.9 million in 1997. The number of Treasury bonds issued during 1997 was 2,979, of which 2,592 were for 2 year maturities, 93 were for 3 year maturities and 294 were for 4 year maturities. The number of coupons received by the PDD for bi-annual coupon payments was 2,035.

During 1997 PDD took several steps to establish a

prices quoted by the PDs were collected by the PDD and

w.a. rates computed on a daily basis for each series of

Treasury bonds for the purpose of publication.

PDs engaged in trading Treasury bonds in the secondary

market mainly through outright buying and selling and repo

transactions of substantial magnitudes. As at end 1997, total

Treasury bonds in the portfolios of the PDS amounted to Rs.

4,023.1 million. •

Treasury Certificates of Deposit

The face value of total sales of TCDs during 1997

amounted to Rs.68.9 million. The entirety of TCD sales was

by the NSB. The maturity period and the annual yield rate

of TCDs issued in 1997 were 12 month and 18.06 per cent,

respectively. Total repayments of TCDs during 1997

amounted to Rs.198.6 million of which Rs.168.1 million was

in respect of capital repayment and Rs.30.5 million

constituted interest payments. The TCDs outstanding as at

end 1997 amounted to Rs.82.6 million.

Other Domestic Debt Instruments

Variable rate debentures of the State Mortgage and

Investment Bank (SMIB) with a maturity of 5-6 years

amounting to Rs.500 million were offered to the public for

subscription in December 1997. The variable rate was linked

to the rate of interest of Rupee Loans of comparable

maturities. The issue however had a poor response reflecting

uncertainties in interest rates resulting from developments in

the foreign exchange market and lack of familiarity of

investors with similar instruments in the market.

There were no issues or repayments in respect of

debentures of the NHDA and UDA. The amounts

outstanding of SMIB, NHDA and UDA debentures remained

unchanged at the previous year levels at Rs.500 million,

Rs.141 million and Rs.83 million, respectively, at end 1997.

The PDD repaid Rs.50,899 of Tax Reserve Certificates

(TRCs) during the year. The outstanding amount of TRCs

remained at Rs.7 million at end 1997.

External Debt

The total external government debt outstanding as at end 1997 amounted to Rs.375,851 million, showing an increase of Rs.16337 million (4.5 percent) as compared with the value at end 1996. Of the total outstanding debt at end 1997, bilateral loans amounted to Rs.188,264 million (50 per cent), while multilateral and commercial loans amounted to Rs.173,265 million (46 per cent) and Rs.14,322 million (4 per cent), respectively. The major creditors in the bilateral category, were Japan, USA and Germany. These sources accounted for Rs.l72,308 million on 92 per cent of the total bilateral loans. The International Development Association (IDA), which is the largest creditor in the multilateral category, accounted for Rs.92,085 million or 53 per cent of the total multilateral debt.

When classified according to the use of funds, project,

programme and commodity loans amounted to Rs.277,258

million (74 per cent), Rs.39,814 million (11 per cent) and

Rs.27,489 million (7 per cent), respectively, of the total

government external debt. Table 11-23 shows the composition

of outstanding external government debt as at end of 1997

disbursements during 1997 amounted to Rs. 24,406 million.

In 1997, 22 new foreign loans were contracted and the

number of operative loans increased to 461 at the end of the

year. These loans carried grace periods ranging from 3 to 7

years and repayment periods from 5 to 42 years. Interest

rates ranged from 0 to 10.85 per cent per annum. The grant

element of the loans ranged between 4. and 91 per cent.

Other Activities

In addition to the issuance and servicing of public debt,

the PDD handled the. activities relating to issuance and

servicing of Central Bank Securities (CBSs). The issue of

CBSs, commenced on 1 September 1997 and they continued

to be available till the end of December 1997. The amount

offered was open-ended for the issues that were kept open

for subscription by the PDs and Commercial banks on a

daily basis.

These issues except for one, had a maturity of 7 days.

The one-off issue had a maturity of 28 days. The interest

rate applied to CBSs was the equivalent of the annualised

daily interest rates used in CBSL repurchase transactions.

Accordingly, the rate of interest applied for 7 day CBSs

ranged from 8.35 - 10.91 per cent per annum while that for

the one-off issue of 28 day maturity was 9.21 per cent per

annum. Total CBSs issues amounted to Rs.7,835 million

during the year. The amount of CBSs outstanding as at end

December 1997 was Rs.10 million. Total interest cost of

CBSs for 1997 amounted to Rs.l3.4 million.

SECRETARIAT

In 1997, the Central Bank implemented an

administrative budget and strict financial controls over

expenditure control within the framework of a comprehensive

corporate plan. In the past, expenditure control was effected

through indicative budgets. Monitoring of expenditure was

planned in order to increase efficiency and cost effectiveness

of the budgetary process.

For this purpose a detailed review of current and capital

expenditure of each department was made and an

administrative and capital expenditure budget prepared for

the Bank. Any request for expenditure outside the budget is

reviewed and supplementary approval obtained.

Total administrative expenditure in 1997 amounted to

Rs.2,264 million of which expenditure excluding note and

coin issue expenses amounted to Rs.l ^35 million. Of this

amount expenditure on personnel which includes salaries,

allowances, overtime payments, taxes, welfare payments, etc.

amounted to Rs.1,150 million or 75 per cent, while

administrative costs and establishment costs amounted to 13

per cent each.

The total staff strength of the Bank at the end of 1997 was 2,152, which included 518 staff grade officers! There were 85 retirements in the course of the year.

There was a marked escalation in some, items of administrative expenditure in 1997. Nine departments of the Bank had been relocated in 10 floors in the World Trade Centre (WTC) Building, Echelon Square, Colombo 1 in November 1996. In the course of 1997 most of the other departments of the Bank were relocated at the Renuka and Equity Two Buildings in Janadhipathi Mawatha. As a result, the costs of rent, rates and other charges such as electricity and water increased markedly.

Capital expenditure in 1997 was Rs.938 million

compared with Rs.508 million in 1996. The bulk of this

expenditure, amounting to Rs.924 million, was on

(XXXIV)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

construction of the new Central Bank building and

rehabilitation of the old building at Janadhipathi Mawatha.

A large amount of furniture and equipment was destroyed

in the bomb blast of January 1996 and had to be replaced.

Although purchases of furniture and equipment had been

made on an urgent basis in 1996, the requirements of all the

departments were not fully met. Equipment such as

photocopying machines and electronic calculators were

obtained, but the purchase of furniture was deferred in view

of the need to relocate offices again after the completion of

the Bank's own buildings. Pending the purchase of

computers under German aid, it was also decided to obtain

the immediate requirements of computers and printers on

hire. The Secretariat Department, therefore, had to keep to

a very busy schedule to ensure the Bank's departments

functioned smoothly by providing them with adequate

furniture and equipment in time.

Again, in October 1997, the smooth functioning of the

bank was temporarily disrupted by a bomb explosion in the

Galadari Hotel car park. The bomb blast caused extensive

damage to the WTC building, but damage to the Bank's own

furniture and equipment was minimal. The Bank was,

therefore, able to carry out its functions, without interruption.

Some relaxation of leave and late attendance rules were

made in the aftermath of this bomb blast..

Compensation payments to the victims of the bomb blast of January 1996 were completed in 1997. Compensation paid out amounted to Rs.98 million, of which

Rs. 51 million was paid to the dependents of deceased employees and Rs.47 million to partially and permanently disabled employees.

In addition to advising the departments of the Bank on

legal matters, the Legal Division represented the Bank in the

Supreme Court and other Courts, and in the Labour Tribunal

in several cases concerning the Bank.

The Legal Division attended to the drafting of the

Regional Development Banks Act No. 6 of 1997 and the

enactment of the regulations under the Monetary Law Act.

The Legal Division also assisted in the preparation of

the following proposed legislation and the subsidiary

legislation:

1. Legislation relating to regulating finance leasing.

2. Amendments to the Monetary Law Act.

3. Legislation to combat money laundering.

4. Regulations under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance.

INFORMATION

During 1997, the Information Department, except the

library situated at the WTC, carried out its operations from

the premises of the Rural Banking and Staff Training

College, Rajagiriya. The Department during the current year

continued to build and strengthen its role as a collector,

storer and disseminator of information to bank personnel and

the public through the multi-media.

In 1997, the library continued collecting and adding

books and magazines to its database, while subscribing to

193 journals in its efforts towards rebuilding the library and

serving its users efficiently. One Staff Officer and 4 non-

staff officers with professional qualifications and experience

were recruited. Organisations, including the IMF, World

Bank and Asia Foundation, continued to support the library

by donation of books and periodicals. The total number of

books and reports/pamphlets accessed during the year

amounted to 4,171 and 2,753 respectively.

In the dissemination of information, the department

released on a regular basis the daily exchange rate, economic

indicators, food and vegetable prices, CCPI information on

Treasury bills , Treasury bonds and Rupee Loans and other

advertisements to the media, both print and electronic.

Apart from its sales outlet at Rajagiriya and in the Regional offices, the Department extended its network of sales outlets to the People's Bank Head Office premises and the Government Publications Bureau. The Annual Report, State of the Economy, Monthly Bulletin, Socio Economic Data - 1997 and other books on economic and social statistics along with the Department's own monthly and bi­monthly publications, Satahana and News Survey, respectively, were released through these outlets. There has been a rising demand for these publications, particularly for Satahana, which on an average has a sale of around 10,000 copies per month. The News Survey however, has not met with similar success being constrained by its limited readership in the English medium. The Department was able to reach a wider spectrum of readers when it successfully ran a sales counter at the Industrial and Trade Exhibition -Jana Nipayuma - held from the 1 to 5 July 1997 in commemoration of the 36th anniversary of the People's Bank.

The printing of publications and other requirements of .the Bank were undertaken by the Printing Press. The Press completed 340 assignments during 1997. The Press was also responsible for the printing of the pocket diaries for 1998 for the second year in succession. The New year greeting cards too continued to be printed at the Press. This year the Press also undertook the printing of the Budget Speech,

( X X X V )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Public Investment Plan and the book - "Budget at a glance'

- on behalf of the Treasury. A limited number of Samurdhi

Pass Books too were printed by the Press.

The task of designing and drawing the cover of the

book, Economic Progress of Independent Sri Lanka 1948 -

1998, the visual art work for the UNICEF's 50th anniversary

commemorative coin, Sri Lanka's Golden Jubilee of

Independence commemorative coins and the designing of

many advertisements were undertaken by the Department.

The Department continued to provide photographic

services for the activities of the Bank, including seminars and

press conferences.

A series of documentary/video films was produced on

behalf of the Rural Credit Department to appraise the success

of the ISURA loan scheme. Copies of these films were

distributed to a number of Asian countries.

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

The Economic Research Department continued to collect

and analyse economic and financial statistics and to conduct

economic research for the guidance of the Governor and the

Monetary Board in policy formulation, and to provide

information to the public. In addition to the Annual Report,

the Department was responsible for the publication of the

Monthly Bulletin and State of the Economy - 1997. This last

publication was an expanded version of the usual Economic

Survey of the first half of the year, and provided not only

an economic survey of the first half of 1997, but also macro-

economic projections for 1997 and 1998. The provision of

weekly financial statistics to the public through the print

media continued, and selected monthly economic indicators

were produced for the information of policy makers. The

Department prepared and submitted the "September 15th

Report" to the Minister of Finance, a report provided under

Section 116 of the Monetary Law Act, to be used in the

preparation of the Budget. The Department was extensively

involved in the preparation of a book "Economic Progress

of Independent Sri Lanka" to be published in 1998 to

commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Sri Lanka's

Independence. In addition, the Department compiled data on

monetary aggregates, balance of payments statistics,

international commodity prices and monthly external trade

statistics, prepared weekly and monthly reports on tea and

rubber auctions in international markets and reports giving

observations and recommendations on various economic

issues for the information of the Monetary. Board, as well

as at the request of ministries and other institutions and

organisations. Surveys on industrial production (half, yearly

and annually), small scale industries, private hospitals and

the feasibility of establishing forward contracts for

agricultural produce were conducted during the year.

The Department continued to provide data to the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a regular basis and

co-ordinated the Government's consultations with the IMF

Missions in May and November 1997. Provision of data to

other international organisations and co-ordination of work

with such institutions were also continued.

The Department conducted a public seminar on

"Current State of the Economy and Future Prospects" in

March 1997 and arranged other seminars by .officers who

returned after post-graduate studies. Lectures by visiting

guest speakers were also arranged by the Department.

The officers of the Department served on internal

committees regarding policy matters such as the Monetary

Operations Unit, the Treasury Bills Tender Committee,

Balance of Payments and Financial Sector Monitoring Unit.

Officers also presented papers on economic issues at

seminars held locally and abroad. In addition, introduction

and computation of two new indices, namely, monthly trade

indices and monthly private sector industrial production

indices were undertaken by the Department in 1997.

STATISTICS AND FEELD SURVEYS

The Statistics Department continued to carry out its .

functions of compilation, analysis and dissemination of (a)

macro level socio economic data including national

accounts, prices and wages, and employment, and (b) micro

level data on the household and corporate sectors. The

collection of wholesale and retail price data of major food

commodities in the key market centres of the country and

publication of the same in the print and electronic media

on a daily basis were continued. A major task accomplished

by the Department was completion of the Consumer

Finances and Socio Economic Survey 1996/97.

Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey 1996/97

The field work of the Consumer Finances and Socio

Economic Survey 1996/97, which was commenced by, the

Department in October 1996, was successfully completed

in December 1997. The survey, consisting of 4 rounds,

covered a sample of 8,880 households drawn from the

Urban, Rural and Estate sectors. The survey was conducted

. in all areas other than the Northern Province and some

areas of the Eastern province.

This is the seventh in the series of Consumer Finances

and Socio Economic Surveys conducted at regular intervals

by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka since 1953. The last

survey in the series was conducted in 1986/87. The primary

objective of the survey is to collect comprehensive data on

(XXXVI)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

socio-economic conditions including demographic profiles,

income, expenditure, consumption, employment, savings and

investments of the households. Such data are useful to assess

the changes in living standards of the population. The

provincial data collected under this survey for the first time

would be used to strengthen the socio economic database at

the provincial level.

A new feature of the present survey is that data were

processed on a round-wise basis so as to disseminate the

findings of the survey without much time lag. The entire

data processing work is being carried out in the Statistics

Department for the first time. The processing of survey data

in respect of 2,147 sampled households in Round 1 and

2,186 households in Round 2 was completed during 1997.

It is expected to release preliminary results of these rounds

shortly.

Country wide Data Collection System

The Country Wide Data Collection System which was commenced by the Statistics Department in 1978 completed its nineteenth year of operation in 1997. Under this programme, information on retail prices of consumer goods, producer prices of agricultural commodities and wage rates pertaining to the informal sector continued to be collected regularly. The scheme was further extended to monitor the agricultural situation in major growing areas. Data collection is accomplished through an island-wide network of school teachers who function as statistical investigators. The sub sectors of paddy, tea, rubber, coconut cultivation and the small scale construction, sector are covered by the scheme. Information collected is published regularly through the print and electronic media. In order to improve the collection of micro level data through investigators, two seminars were conducted in Matara and Colombo in 1997.

The Department continued with its scheme of collecting wholesale prices of major food items mainly from the Pettah market on a daily basis and from other major producing centres with a view to (a) disseminating the information to farmers, traders and consumers and (b) monitoring the variations in wholesale and retail prices. Information so collected is published and is also used for the compilation of national accounts and price and real wage indices. The collection of price information from the Jaffna market, which was not possible for some time due to the security situation, was also recommenced from September 1997.

National Accounts

The Department continued the activities in connection

with the estimation of National Accounts. These included the

collection and compilation of primary and secondary data.

The Department is also in the process of compiling national

accounts at more frequent intervals. With the improvement

of the database, it was possible to publish GDP projections

for 1997 in advance in the publication, 'State of the

Economy - 1997'.

Employment Statistics

The Annual Survey of Public Sector Employment was.

carried out in 1997 with the objective of ascertaining the

trends in employment in government departments, ministries,

Provincial Councils, local authorities and the corporation

sector. Preliminary work relating to obtaining employment

statistics from the database of the Employees' Provident

Fund was completed during the year.

Publications

The Department released its two annual publications

entitled "Sri Lanka Socio Economic Data" and "Economic

and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka" which provide

comprehensive time-series and cross-sectional data on socio

economic variables including demography, labour force and

employment, national income and expenditure, agriculture,

industry, external trade and finance, prices and wages,

money, banking, capital market, government finance and

socio economic services. The data in these publications also

include comparative statistics for regional economic groups.

In addition, the Department contributed to several other

publications of the Central Bank.

DATA PROCESSING

The Data Processing Department (DPD) moved into the WTC building and installed 2 IBM AS400 computer systems in November 1996. Some old applications were migrated to the new system with modifications in 1997. Work also commenced on the development of new applications for many departments.

One AS400 system was installed at the EPF Department

and a team of Analyst Programmers directly under the

supervision of the Deputy Director, Data Processing

Department, developed and made operational a new system

for processing EPF data. This system is currently being

expanded to streamline and expedite the processing of EPF

data.

A Human Resource Management package was installed

in the AS400 system at the DPD and many of its modules

were made operational. Work is continuing to complete the

implementation of the other modules including the

development of the personal data base of all employees and

payment of salaries.

(XXXVII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Using personal computer systems, an integrated package

for processing the country wide market information of the

Statistics Department was implemented. A system, for

maintaining the leave and attendance of all departments was

developed and is due to be installed in all departments in

early 1998.

The AS400 computer system in the Data Processing

Department was linked to all the commercial banks for

monitoring the liquidity position of the commercial banks.

All commercial banks now transmit the relevant information

by 9.30 a.m. each day. '

The project for modernisation of the Central Bank

computer environment was launched and a tender has been

awarded for the supply of personal computers, servers and

other equipment to initially install some Local Area

Networks in the departments. Once the new extension

building is completed and the Old Central Bank building is

renovated, these will be transferred and linked to form one

network. This system will create a modern technological

environment in the Central Bank.

Steps have also been taken to carry out a study on the

automation of banking activities including the installation of

a real time gross settlement payment system and scripless

government securities trading.

Ten Senior Analyst Programmers and two System

Engineers were also recruited to the Department to enable

it to carry out all the above projects efficiently.

Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House (SLACH)

During the year under review, the cheque volume

processed increased by 1,553,811 items, thus raising the total

volume of cheques processed to 29261,633

The SLACH continued its normal operations except for some disruption due to the bomb blast of 15 October 1997. Although much damage was caused to the building, the equipment was not damaged and SLACH commenced operations on the second day following the blast. Action has been taken to establish a back up site for the SLACH. This project will also look into the possibility of using imaging, which is a new technology being used for expediting and modernising the automated cheque clearing operation.

The off-line Inter Bank payment System (SLIPS) suffered a set back in 1996 due to the Central Bank bomb blast destroying the main computer system of the Bank. However, in 1997 these transactions were reactivated and the Central Bank systems were developed to accommodate future value dates from the limited one value date system which operated temporarily. More and more transactions are going

through the SLIPS system. Much work was also done to carry forward the implementation of Phase III of the Project which is for the payment of direct debits. It is hoped that this project will be fully implemented in 1998.

TRAINING

During the year under review, the Central Bank, continued its policy of training officers in academic as well as non -academic fields. Academic training was related to post graduate studies in Economics and allied fields at recognised universities abroad. During the year, six officers proceeded abroad to follow Masters Degree courses in Economics. In addition, one officer followed a Diploma Course in Statistics at the International Statistical Education Centre, India.

Non-academic training comprising short-term, courses, seminars and workshops, both local and foreign, was related to specific fields relevant to the Bank. During 1997, a total of 53 officers proceeded abroad on short-term training on 41 training programs. A total of 127 officers participated in 20 training courses conducted by the Rural Banking and Staff Training College while 62 officers participated in 22 courses and seminars held at other local institutions.

The Department also conducted classes in Economics and Mathematics for those officers intending to proceed abroad on postgraduate studies. The Department continued its usual functions of holding promotional examinations for certain categories of employees and the postgraduate scholarship qualifying examination for Staff Officers.

MANAGEMENT AUDIT

During 1997 the Management Audit Department carried

out its audit programme to ensure adherence to the rules,

regulations, interpretations and internal control systems of the

Central Bank with the objective of increasing the efficiency

and effectiveness of the Bank. Whenever deficiencies and

deviations were observed in the course of audit, they were

brought to the notice of the relevant authorities.

After the relocation of the Central Bank Head Office

in the World Trade Centre in November 1996, audit units

were re-established in the Secretariat, Welfare and Banking

Departments during 1997'to provide auditing services to

these departments more efficiently.

Auditing of the Central Bank Regional Office in Anuradhapura was conducted according to the Departmental Audit Programme, while physical verification of Bank vehicles maintained by the Premises Department and currency notes and coins in the Currency Department vaults

(XXXVIII)

Part II .

were carried out during the year. Surprise checks on cash

counters were done from time to time. Furthermore, pre-

audits relating to the revision of salary scales of the Bank

employees, relief payments to employees who were affected

by the bomb blast and payment transactions relating to the

construction of the new building of the Bank were also

carried out during the year.

In addition to the above work, studies on the

requirement of Staff Assistants in the Central Bank and staff

requirements of the Central Bank Clinic were undertaken as

required by the management and completed during the year.

PREMISES

During 1997, the Premises Department continued to

perform its maintenance work and upkeeping of basic

necessities to create a pleasant environment for Bank

employees who were relocated at various rented buildings

close to the former Head Office premises.

Apart from the above functions the Premises Department had to effect repair urgently to relocate the Currency Department in the Treasury Building in November 1997.

The functions assigned by the Monetary Board to co­ordinate work at the Central Bank Building Extension Project and Repairs to the Old Building have been delegated to a new department from November 1997.

NEW BUILDINGS

The New Buildings Department established in November 1997 is entrusted with the task of attending to the work connected with the Extension Building Project and the Head Office Rehabilitation Project. The work connected with these two building projects was hitherto carried out by a separate unit with officers released from the Premises Department. As the two building projects had to be completed urgently it was considered appropriate that a separate department be created and the Head of Department appointed be. given sufficient powers to carry out the activities of the projects without delays or hindrances.

Extension to the Central Bank Head Office Building

The construction work in respect of this project commenced in August 1994 and continued during 1997. The progress of the work was affected considerably due to unforeseen sub-soil conditions, stoppage of work due to security reasons; restriction of heavy vehicular traffic in the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Fort area and interruption of work consequent to the bomb blast that took place on 31 January, 1996. At the end of 1997 around 75 per cent of the civil work and 43 per cent of the total work had been completed. The Electrical/ Mechanical work has now commenced.

The building project is expected to be completed in

August, 1998. With the completion of the building, the Bank

would be able to accommodate, many of its departments

which are now housed in rented premises.

Damaged Head Office Building

Due to the complex nature of the repair work involved to the Head Office Building resulting from the bomb blast which caused extensive damage, considerable time was taken to finalise the actual volume of repair work that has to be undertaken, to consult the panel of engineers, to evaluate tender proposals received and thereafter, to negotiate with the contractor. The rehabilitation work of the building has been awarded to M/s. Ed Zublin AG of Stuttgart, Germany and the consultancy services in respect of project management, design approvals, construction supervision and architectural and M & E design and drawings, have been assigned to Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau. The order to commence the repair work was issued to the contractor in December 1997 after the Currency Department was re­located in the Treasury Building. In December 1997, the contractor commenced the dismantling of damaged machinery and equipment, windows and sanitary fittings, electrical and air-conditioning fittings, demolishing of damaged walls etc. and removal of architectural elements from the building in order to facilitate repair work.

The rehabilitation work on this building is expected to be completed in April 1999.

WELFARE

The Welfare Department continued to provide enhanced facilities in 1997 to the staff affected by the bomb explosion in 1996 while also providing routine welfare facilities. The Department administered several concessional loan schemes for housing, vehicles and other financial requirements of employees and advances and reimbursements were made under the Staff Medical Benefit Schemes for the medical expenses of employees and their dependants within the quotas approved by the Bank. The special facilities provided in 1996 to cover medical requirements of the employees who were affected by the bomb explosion continued to be in operation during the year.

The subsidised Railway and Bus Season Ticket scheme

and the Railway Warrant scheme also continued as in the

(XXXIX)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

previous years. Since the departments of the Central Bank

were located at several places, the provision of canteen

facilities remained limited during the year 1997. The

Department provided facilities according to the needs arising

from the various locations where the employees were

deployed for their work from time to time.

The Central Bank Medical Clinic was re-established and

the facilities provided by the Clinic were restored to a

significant extent as most of the equipment had been

destroyed in the fire following the bomb explosion. However,

a flexible approach was adopted in the reimbursement of

medical expenses of the employees who were injured. The

facilities provided to the bomb victims to obtain medical

expenses upto Rs.250,000 for local medical treatment and

upto Rs.250,000 for treatment abroad were continued. The

employees whose medical expenses exceeded these ceilings

were assisted from the Special Fund established for this

purpose.

In addition, a relief package introduced in 1996 for the

Central Bank employees whose vehicles v/ere damaged in the

bomb explosion continued during the year.

In order to provide relief for the employees by way of

providing an enhanced take home salary, a scheme was

introduced to amalgamate and reschedule the welfare loans

obtained by the employees. In addition, the interest charged

on housing loans was reduced marginally.

Although the database, the accounting system and all

other records of the Welfare Department were destroyed in

the fire of January 1996 the Department has been able to

reconstruct the entire accounting system to administer the

welfare loans and other welfare schemes effectively. A

computerised accounting and payment system has been

introduced to improve the efficiency of the Department and

reduce the cost of welfare management.
