    "text": "The demand for domestic resources by the Government to finance the deficit was significantly curtailed in 1997, reducing the crowding out impact. The proceeds of the Floating Rate Notes (FRN) issue, amounting to US dollars 50 million, were also available to meet infrastructure expenditure. The use of privatisation proceeds to retire high cost public debt and the commitments' made to reduce the statutory limit of Treasury bills from Rs.l25 billion to Rs.l 15 billion, enhanced the credibility of fiscal policy. The .1998 Budget expects to make further progress in privatisation and to use such divestiture proceeds for further retirement of public debt. Reflecting the retirement of debt, Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank declined from Rs.17,100 million at end 1996 to Rs.7,222 million at end 1997. Part of the privatisation proceeds was also placed in a special deposit with the Central Bank. The outcome was a reduction in net credit to the Government from the Central Bank by Rs.13,991 million. However, net credit to government by the entire banking system declined by Rs.2,172 million as commercial bank holdings of Treasury bills increased after the reduction of the statutory reserve requirement. In addition, the Government's stock of administrative borrowings was reduced by Rs.6,654 million in 1997. The 1998 Budget has targetted an overall deficit of 6.5 per cent of GDP (excluding privatisation). This deficit is expected to be reduced to 4 per cent of GDP by the year 2000.",

    "text": "The Government continued with tax policy reforms aiming at a simple, broad based and transparent tax structure. Reforms in the income tax structure continued in order to promote investments and to broaden the base, through improved tax compliance and tax administration. The distortionary dual threshold system of Rs.100,000 for non-employment income and Rs.144,000 for employment income was replaced with a uniform system with a tax threshold of Rs.144,000 for all tax payers. The lower tax slabs, which were subject to concessionary rates, were widened from Rs.35,000 to Rs.100,000. This shifted the annual income level for the highest marginal tax rate from Rs.205,000 for non-employment income earners and Rs.249,000 for employment income earners to over Rs.444,000 for both categories, giving substantial relief to personal income tax payers. The withholding tax on interest income was also reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. The liability to pay PAYE tax was re-imposed on employees in commercially oriented public corporations as this tax liability had been paid by the respective institutions since 1993. Concessions were granted to retirees on their terminal benefits by raising the limit on which concessionary rates were applicable from Rs.l.5 million to Rs.l.8 million and also by widening the bands. In addition, tax administration was improved to",

On imported motor vehicles, the allowable maximum depreciation was reduced to 30 per cent of the FOB value from 90 per cent. As various custom duty exemptions were being abused, a levy equivalent to the 3-month Treasury bill rate was introduced where cases of abuse were detected.",

The convertible debentures, which were to mature in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were converted into 18.33 million ordinary shares at a par value of Rs. 10 per share and offered to the market through the Colombo Stock Exchange. As the issue was too large to be absorbed by the domestic market, 16.5 million shares were offered abroad, while 916,667 shares were offered to domestic investors. The remaining 916,666 shares were purchased by the NDB for its employee Stock Ownership Plan.

The retirement of Treasury bills held with the Central Bank amounted to Rs.10,000 million (face value). In addition, the settlements were made to the two state banks. The net impact of these operations resulted in an overall repayment of Rs.2,172 million to the banking system in 1997 compared to net borrowings of Rs.l3,090 million from the banking system in the previous year. The financing of the deficit through the Central Bank declined by Rs.13,991 million, which was a larger reduction than the initial retirement of Treasury bills. Net credit to Government from commercial banks amounted to Rs.l 1,618 million due to banks investing most of the funds released through the reduction of statutory reserve requirements, in Treasury bills. Government deposits held with the banking system at end 1997 totalled Rs.20,206 million, consisting of Rs.6,467 million with the Central Bank and Rs.13,739 million with commercial banks.",
