8. FISCAL POLICY AND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

8.1 Overview and Policy Strategy

The 1997 budgetary policies were formulated with the

objective of making further progress towards firm fiscal

consolidation. The primary emphasis was placed on reducing

the fiscal deficit in 1997, while correcting existing

weaknesses in fiscal management, with a firm commitment

to the continuation of the privatisation programme.

Accordingly, a cleaning of public accounts, rationalisation.of

off-budget transactions, strengthening of financial controls

and accountability, improving of revenues, reduction of

wasteful expenditure, elimination of corruption and

consolidation of social expenditures were expected. The

budget deficit was expected to be financed through non-

inflationary sources. Considerable progress was made in

1997. The growth of expenditure was contained and the

privatisation programme proceeded successfully. The overall

fiscal deficit was reduced to below the target set for the year,

enabling a net reduction in debt to the banking system with

a larger reduction in government debt to the Central Bank.

These achievements, together with a cautious monetary

policy adopted in 1997, helped to maintain a relatively stable

domestic financial market in a highly unstable global

environment which was triggered by the East Asian financial

crisis. The 1998 Budget was presented, within a relatively

favourable macroeconomic environment, with a view to

further strengthening these achievements and accelerating

economic development.

The overall budget deficit (after grants) was brought

down to 4.5 per cent of GDP which was a 3.3 percentage

point reduction compared to a deficit of 7.8 per cent in 1996.

Compared to the original Budget target, the overall budget

deficit in 1997 was lower by 1.6 per cent of GDP. This

improvement was the outcome of the larger than expected

receipts from privatisation (Rs.22,535 million), improved

collection of non-tax revenues, improved cash management

with strict control over unproductive, wasteful expenditures

and supplementary expenditure and interest savings due to

retirement of high cost debt. The upward adjustment of

wheat flour prices by 12 per cent from Rs.l6.95 per kg. to

Rs.18.95 per kg. and revision of the fertiliser subsidy

targetting it at low-income farmers in the agriculture sector

also contributed to contain the growth of recurrent

expenditure in 1997. Besides this, project implementation

delays, particularly in port development, power, energy and

telecommunication, resulted in a shortfall in capital

expenditure and affected the utilisation of foreign aid.

The demand for domestic resources by the Government to finance the deficit was significantly curtailed in 1997, reducing the crowding out impact. The proceeds of the Floating Rate Notes (FRN) issue, amounting to US dollars 50 million, were also available to meet infrastructure expenditure. The use of privatisation proceeds to retire high cost public debt and the commitments' made to reduce the statutory limit of Treasury bills from Rs.l25 billion to Rs.l 15 billion, enhanced the credibility of fiscal policy. The .1998 Budget expects to make further progress in privatisation and to use such divestiture proceeds for further retirement of public debt. Reflecting the retirement of debt, Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank declined from Rs.17,100 million at end 1996 to Rs.7,222 million at end 1997. Part of the privatisation proceeds was also placed in a special deposit with the Central Bank. The outcome was a reduction in net credit to the Government from the Central Bank by Rs.13,991 million. However, net credit to government by the entire banking system declined by Rs.2,172 million as commercial bank holdings of Treasury bills increased after the reduction of the statutory reserve requirement. In addition, the Government's stock of administrative borrowings was reduced by Rs.6,654 million in 1997. The 1998 Budget has targetted an overall deficit of 6.5 per cent of GDP (excluding privatisation). This deficit is expected to be reduced to 4 per cent of GDP by the year 2000.

The Government continued with tax policy reforms aiming at a simple, broad based and transparent tax structure. Reforms in the income tax structure continued in order to promote investments and to broaden the base, through improved tax compliance and tax administration. The distortionary dual threshold system of Rs.100,000 for non-employment income and Rs.144,000 for employment income was replaced with a uniform system with a tax threshold of Rs.144,000 for all tax payers. The lower tax slabs, which were subject to concessionary rates, were widened from Rs.35,000 to Rs.100,000. This shifted the annual income level for the highest marginal tax rate from Rs.205,000 for non-employment income earners and Rs.249,000 for employment income earners to over Rs.444,000 for both categories, giving substantial relief to personal income tax payers. The withholding tax on interest income was also reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. The liability to pay PAYE tax was re-imposed on employees in commercially oriented public corporations as this tax liability had been paid by the respective institutions since 1993. Concessions were granted to retirees on their terminal benefits by raising the limit on which concessionary rates were applicable from Rs.l.5 million to Rs.l.8 million and also by widening the bands. In addition, tax administration was improved to

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

recover PA YE taxes and income tax arrears. To promote

foreign investment, tax exemptions were granted on equity

income in joint ventures. Tax holidays were granted to firms

investing in high technology projects.

The turnover tax structure was revised to facilitate a

smooth transition towards a Goods and Services Tax (GST).

The 6 per cent and 10 per cent tax rate bands were gradually

raised upward to 8 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively,

to avoid significant price changes with the introduction of

the GST, as the GST was to be a single moderate rate of

12.5 per cent. Petroleum products such as diesel and

kerosene were exempted from turnover tax (TT), while the

excise tax on diesel was adjusted upwards to prevent revenue

loss. All varieties of hard liquor and selected passenger

motor vehicles were brought under the Excise (Special

Provisions) Act, by imposing a 10 per cent and a 5 per cent

tax, respectively.

The proportion of production that had to be exported

to make an industry eligible for tax concessions was' lowered,

to expand the coverage of incentives to the export sector,

by way of tax and duty concessions on capital and

intermediate goods imports. In order to promote investment,

a higher investment tax allowance, an accelerated

depreciation allowance on plant, machinery and equipment

and a reduction of the national security levy on import of

machinery and equipment from 2 per cent to 0.5 per cent,

were granted. With a view to promoting capital and share

market development, the stamp duty on quoted share

transactions was abolished, full imputation credit on

dividends distributed by quoted public companies was

granted and investors were permitted to set off the

depreciation allowance on leased assets against leasing

income. Sector specific packages of tax concessions were

introduced to encourage investment in priority areas such as

advanced technology projects, computer technology and

labour intensive projects in remote areas.

A Presidential Tariff Commission was appointed to make recommendations on tariff reforms to rationalise the industrialisation strategy within the context of the emerging international environment. A partial duty waiver of 10 percentage points was given on petroleum products to help contain domestic price increases. In view of the high domestic prices, full and partial duty waivers were granted on some consumer goods such as sugar, rice, potatoes and onions. On imported motor vehicles, the allowable maximum depreciation was reduced to 30 per cent of the FOB value from 90 per cent. As various custom duty exemptions were being abused, a levy equivalent to the 3-month Treasury bill rate was introduced where cases of abuse were detected.

To simplify taxes, stamp duties were made uniform at

2 per cent across a wide range of documents. The dual levy

on diesel motor vehicles was unified at Rs.5,000 per annum.

Turnover tax on financial instruments was also unified at 2

per cent.

Administration fees and charges were revised upward on

the basis of the 'user pays' principle. Postal rates were

increased and the use of free postal facilities was restricted

to government institutions and Members of Parliament.

Sundays and public holidays were made non-business days

for post offices to contain heavy operational losses. An

inflation adjusted lease rental scheme was introduced for

privatised plantation companies and appropriate levies were

imposed on commercially viable public enterprises. In

addition, the rate of social security contributions by

employees was increased by 1 percentage point to enhance

the employees' participation in the Widows and Orphans

Pension (W&OP) programme.

On the expenditure side, unproductive or least

productive expenditure in selected areas such as travelling,

fuel and lubricants, other office equipment, transport,

communication utilities and other supplies was cut by 20 per

cent, except in the case of expenditure on health and national

security. Provision for the purchases of motor vehicles by

government institutions was.frozen. The debt profile

improved with the retirement of high cost public debt

comprising Rs.10,000 million of Treasury bills held with the

Central Bank and other debt to the two state banks. Wheat

and fertiliser subsidy expenditures were contained with an

upward adjustment of the wheat flour price and better

targeting of the fertiliser subsidy. Public investment was

targetted at 6.8 per cent of GDP, but the actual investment

was only 5.8 per cent. An Infrastructure Development Fund

was established to mobilise resources for private sector

infrastructure projects. Private sector participation in

infrastructure projects was encouraged under BOO/BOT

policies.

The public enterprise reform programme progressed well with privatisation proceeds reaching .Rs. 22,535 million against the original budgetary target of Rs. 5,000 million. The privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom and two salt companies and the sale of convertible debentures of the National Development Bank and plantation company shares were undertaken in 1997. In 1998, further retirement of public debt is expected, using divestiture proceeds.

Improved fiscal performance, together with the reduction

of the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR), helped to bring

down interest rates. The weighted average yield rate on

Treasury bills (1 year bills) dropped from 17.11 per cent at

the beginning of the year to 10.17 per cent at the end of

the year. Interest rates on Rupee Loans were also adjusted

downward from 14.5 per cent at the beginning of the year

to 11.25 per cent at the end of 1997.

108

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

A new medium term marketable debt instrument, i.e.

'Treasury bonds', was introduced in March 1997 and these

were issued fortnightly. The coupon rate on these instruments

was also adjusted downward from 14.5 per cent in early

1997 to 11.50 per cent by end 1997 in line with changing

market interest rates. The benefits of this reduction of the

interest structure would largely be seen in the 1998

budgetary outcome. New domestic resources for deficit

financing in 1997 came entirely through Rupee Loans and

Treasury bonds. The Government announced its intention in

the 1998 Budget to reduce the Treasury bill limit from

Rs.125 billion to Rs.l 15 billion and to improve the medium

and long-term debt security market. The issue of Floating

Rate Notes (FRN) amounting to US dollars 50 million in

the international market for financing infrastructure

development projects, as well as a benchmarking exercise,

was fully subscribed reflecting foreign investor confidence.

The underutilisation of foreign resources continued to be a

key issue that needs to be addressed effectively.

during the recent past, from 23.5 per cent of GDP in 1995

to 22.8 per cent of GDP in 1996 and to 20.7 per cent in

1997, reflects the effectiveness of improved cash

management and fiscal discipline.

8.2 Budget Out-turn

The budgetary operations in 1997 showed significant

improvement. The current account deficit declined to 2.2 per

cent from 3.8 per cent of GDP in 1996, entirely attributed

to the reduction of recurrent expenditure as a ratio of GDP.

The overall budget deficit (after grants) declined to 4.5 per

cent of GDP from 7.8 per cent of GDP in 1996.

Government revenue collection, as a percentage of GDP,

declined from 19.0 per cent in 1996 to 18.5 per cent due to

the reduction in tax revenue. Tax revenues from major

revenue sources such as income tax, import duty and the

national security levy indicated only a slow growth due to

increases in the tax exemption thresholds, reduction of tax

rates, exemption from taxes and duty waivers granted during

the year. Despite the increase in the excise tax rate on

liquor and cigarettes, tax revenues did not increase as

expected due to the drop in production and sale of these

products in 1997. Non-tax revenue recorded a shaip increase

owing to timely collection and recovery of arrears in respect

of interest, levies, profits and dividends. Non-tax revenue

accounted for 2.3 per cent of GDP in 1997 compared to 2.1

per cent in 1996.

The measures taken to rationalise current expenditure, revise wheat flour prices upward and target the development and household welfare programmes for the needy in a better manner, helped to contain the growth of recurrent expenditure at 20.7 per cent of GDP compared to 22.8 per cent of GDP in 1996.. Security expenditure as a per cent of GDP also declined from 5.9 per cent in 1996 to 5.1 per cent in 1997. The continuous reduction of current expenditure

The benefits in the reduction of interest rates and the

retirement of public debt on interest payments were partly

reflected in 1997. The full benefits will be reflected in 1998.

Interest costs as a proportion of GDP, declined marginally

to 6.2 per cent of GDP from 6.4 per cent in 1996. Interest

costs represented 30 per cent of total current expenditure and

absorbed 34 per cent of total revenue and continued to be

a large burden on the Government. A surplus in the primary

account of 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1997, as against a deficit

of 2.4 per cent in 1996, was a notable development in the

fiscal front. In addition, a sustainable reduction in the

budget deficit is necessary to achieve a further substantial

reduction in interest cost.'

Public investment (the sum of capital expenditure and on lending) declined to 5.8 per cent of GDP against the expected target of 6.8 per cent of GDP in the 1997 Budget. This was reflected largely in a reduction of on lending. The repayments on account of previous on lending were higher in 1997. Capital expenditure was maintained at the 1996 level. The Government has to maintain capital expenditure in some areas such as roads while permitting the gradual entry of the private sector into areas where they can perform better.

There has been a significant level of underutilisation of available foreign resources, which are almost entirely of a concessionary nature, due to delays in project implementation, disputes at project implementing agencies, lack of domestic funds to absorb foreign resources etc. The amount of foreign grants and loans used in financing the deficit in 1997 was only 1.9 per cent of GDP, indicating a decline from the previous year's level of 2.3 per cent of

GDP. .

The mobilisation of domestic resources in 1997 was

mainly through market-based instruments. The Government

has made a firm commitment to reduce the Treasury bill

limit by Rs.10,000 million to Rs.l 15,000 million. This would

help improve the medium and long-term securities market.

Government securities were shifted towards greater market

orientation by a gradual process of replacing traditional non-

marketable Rupee Loans by Treasury bonds. In 1997,

Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Treasury bonds amounting to Rs.10,000 million were issued.

Rupee Loans amounting to Rs.48,500 million were also

issued during the year. Of this, Rs.15,000 million was used

for repayment of maturing Rupee Loans. All Rupee Loan

issues were subscribed by statutory funds and public

institutions such as the EPF, NSB, ETF, public sector

provident funds (PSPF) and the insurance corporations. The

EPF and the NSB invested Rs.42,759 million in Rupee

Loans. They also invested Rs.4,792 million in Treasury bonds, thus accounting for 81 per cent of the gross borrowings of the Government in 1997. Net credit to the government from the banking system was a net repayment of Rs.2,172 million in 1997. The contractionary impact of budgetary operations was, however, much larger, as there was a Rs.13,991 million repayment of net credit to the Government by the Central Bank.

8 3 Revenue and Grants

In 1997, revenue increased by 13 per cent to reach Rs.164,865 million. Tax revenue, at Rs.144,006 million, recorded a growth of 11 per cent as in the previous year. Non-tax revenue showed a substantial increase of 30 per

cent, owing to the increase in property income and the levies imposed on selected public enterprises (such as Bank of Ceylon, Ports Authority etc.) during 1997. Foreign grants utilised for budgetary purposes were estimated at Rs.7,500 million compared to Rs.7.739 million in 1996.

Tax Revenue

Most of the tax revenues in Sri Lanka are in the forms of indirect taxes as many sectors have been exempted from income taxes. Indirect taxes account for 86 per cent of total tax revenue. However, in order to reduce the regressivity of the tax structure, many essential consumer goods including most food items have been exempted from taxation. However, this has made the tax structure less transparent. The Goods and Services Tax is expected to correct some of these weaknesses.

Tax revenue as a ratio of GDP declined from 16.9 per cent in 1996 to 16.2 per cent in 1997. As a share of total revenue too, tax revenues declined to 87 per cent from 89 per cent in 1996. This was due to the slow growth of revenues from import duty, the national security levy (NSL), income tax, excise tax on cigarettes and excise duty on liquor. Tax revenues from domestic goods and services such as the turnover taxes, NSL, excise tax and licence fees increased by 14 per cent and their share in total tax revenue increased to 61 per cent from 59 per cent in 1996. These amounted to 9.8 per cent of GDP.

The NSL, which was applicable to all goods other than exports and on selected services, generated Rs.17,274 million (1.9 per cent of GDP) recording a 5 per cent increase. Revenue from this source accounted for 12 per­cent of total tax collections. Despite the reduction of (he NSL on imports of machinery and equipment from 2 per cent to 0.5 per cent, collections from imports recorded a 13 per cent increase in 1997, reflecting the higher import growth in 1997.

Revenue from turnover taxes, at Rs.43,257 million, increased by 15 per cent, mainly due to increased collection from the non-manufacturing sector and the realisation of the full impact of an increase in the tax rate bands from 6 per cent and 10 per cent to 7 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. To facilitate the move to GST these rates were further revised (the 7 per cent and 11 per cent tax bands to 8 per cent and 12 per cent and the 20 per cent tax band to 18 per cent) from November 1997. This had a positive impact on revenues. Turnover taxes accounted for 30 per cent of total taxes in 1997. Turnover tax collections from the manufacturing sector increased by 7 per cent in 1997. Turnover tax collections from the non-manufacturing sector increased by 38 per cent, reflecting the rapid expansion of

Tax Compliance

Realised tax revenue depends on the tax hase. tax

tale and the tax compliance tale. The lax base (the

value of all items subject to taxation) vanes with the

growth of the economy and with the changes in tax

policies Tax rates have been revised downward recently

with the long-term objective of simplifying the tax

system, leading to a uniform tax. Tax rates have also

been lowered with a view to increasing tax compliance

and offering incenti\*es to investors. In the context of

simplifying the tax structuie and reduction ot the tax

rate, the increase of tax revenue has become increasingly

dependent on the rate of tax compliance and the supply

response to tax reductions.

Tax compliance is the voluntary adherence to ta.x

laws relating to filing compliance, payment compliance

and reporting compliance. Filing compliance is the

submission ot duly completed tax tetutns on the due

date The dale oi filing tax returns varies according

to the type of lax. Foi example, income tax is

calculated on an annual basis and is paid quartet ly. Tax

returns are filed annually Payment compliance is the

payment of lax or tax instalment on or belore the due

date without falling into arrears. Reporting compliance

is reporting the taxable income and other details and the

tax payable accurately in the tax returns without under

reporting to evade tax. Achieving 100 per cent tax

compliance in 'all these areas is the ideal situation.

Where voluntary compliance levels are low and

unsatisfactory, the tax administration will be compelled

to apply enforcement measures that aie accompanied by

additional costs incurred in deploying its limited human

and financial resource1:. In addition, in enforcing these

measures, bottlenecks are bound to arise aflecting

effectiveness of the fax administration system.

Filing compliance in Sri Lanka has been low. that

is. it has remained around 50 - 60 per cent e\cn after

one month of the due date. This phenomenon is

particulaily evident in respect of income tax. The table

below gives the filing compliance rates dunng the past

Jew years. It has increased lo around 90 per cent only

after 13 months fiom the due date.

The tax filing compliance rate in Sri Lanka compares poorly with developed countries where 96 per cent of known tax payers file their returns on the due date. 98 per cent one month later and 100 per cent within two months.

Payment compliance of taxes in Sri Lanka has also not been encouraging, particularly in respect ot payment of income tax by non-salary earners where a greater degiee of sell assessment is involved. Income tax arreais have remained at more than J/3 of the total

Even though reliable data on the extent of under

reporting of taxes aie not available, undei reporting is

known to be extensive, fax evasion is believed to be

prevailing widely among those persons whose incomes

do not enter into propei records. These categories

mainly include prolessionals who provide services on

payment and traders who do not isMie proper receipts.

The relatively low tax compliance in Sri Lanka is

attributed to the following factors.

Complicated tax \tuiciure: II the lax system is

complicated and revised often, taxpayers will not

undersiand it and they will have difficulties in self-

assessment. The taxpayer should be able to calculate

his tax liability without much difficulty.

High marginal tax rotes: A high marginal tax rate

makes tax compliance more expensive and leads to

conuption in the tax administration.

Lack of knowledge of the taxpayers about their

obligations: The taxpayer should understand the

importance of paying taxes and the cost of not paying

the taxes on the due dates.

Social attitude towards fax evasion: In Sri Lanka, tax evasion, non-filing and delay in pajmcnts aie not considered anti-social Having to pay (he penalties is not regarded as a serious offence by society.

Equity and fainiew of the tax system: A tax system

should be recognised and accepted by the public as fair

and equitable for better ta<c compliance. II some

important sectors and persons evade payment of tax and

delay payments for excessively long periods through

exemptions etc.. there is a genuine cause for non­

compliance by others. Granting of tax amnesties at

regular intervals affects tax compliance. It contributes

to inequality, which disLOuragcs the voluntary genuine

taxpayers. Similarly, discriminatory treatment to

taxpayers in the same category also lowers ta\

compliance.

Level of efficiency of the Mi adtmnistiaiion: Ta\

personnel have to be courteous and efficient in the

administration of tax laws. Compliance and

enforcement measures complement each other and. if

they are effective, the delinquent as well as law abiding

tax payers would have no better option than to comply

Some measures have been taken to impiove tax

compliance. They include certain simplifications to the

tax structure by reducing the number of lax brackets.

taken to improve tax compliance. Among these would

- Tax laws should be simplified further and the

tax authorities should issue cleai guidelines to

- Errant taxpayers should be dealt with appropriately. They should be idcntilied effectively to keep the good taxpayers honest and deteirent penalties should be imposed on defaulters

certain activities in the sector such as electricity,

telecommunication, air travel and hotel services. The

unification of the turnover tax on banking and financial

institutions at 2 per cent from November 1996 and further

reduction to 1 per cent from November 1997 had a negative

impact on revenue. The revenue from turnover tax on

imports registered a moderate growth of 7 per cent in spite

of the increase in the total value of imports by 15 per cent

in 1997. A moderate growth in dutiable imports (7 per cent)

due to the duty waivers and turnover tax exemptions granted

for certain imports such.as machines used for packing milk,

tea bags and meat, yarn, colour separators used in the tea

industry, tankers, bowsers and trucks, and ihe reduction of

the mark-up from 25 per cent to 10 per cent from November

1997 were mainly responsible for this slow growth.

Excise taxes increased by 18 per cent and accounted for

18 per cent of tax revenue. The excise tax collection from

cigarettes increased by 15 per cent in 1997 compared to a

46 per cent growth in the previous year. This slowing of tax

collections from cigarettes despite an upward revision of the

excise tax by 7 per cent, was due to a 6 per cent drop in

sales of cigarettes. The reduction of legal sales of cigarettes

indicates that high taxes have dampened the consumption of

cigarettes, as the tax level on cigarettes has already reached

a prohibitive level. This has led to an expansion of illegal

cigarette sales, Despite the total production of all the major

varieties of hard liquor, except blended arrack, declining by

18 per cent, the upward revision of excise duty on hard

liquor and the increase in the production of beer by 19 per

cent contributed to increase the excise tax collections from

liquor by 6 per cent. The revenue obtained under the Excise

(Special Provision) Act showed a marked increase of 49 per

cent, mainly due to the replacement of a specific type of

excise duty on selected petroleum products by an ad valorem

duty at a higher tax rate and the introduction of a 10 per

cent excise tax on hard liquor and 5 per cent excise tax on

the import of selected passenger motor vehicles. Excise duty

rates on cigarettes, liquor and selected consumer durables

were increased from November 1997 to compensate for the

revenue loss due to the reduction in turnover tax from 20

per cent to 18 per cent on such products. Since November

1997, taxation under the Excise (Special Provision) Act has

been confined to cigarettes, liquor, motor vehicles and

selected petroleum products in order to simplify the tax

structure.

Duty collection from imports increased only by 5 per

cent in 1997, in spite of a 15 per cent increase in the value

of imports, as the share of dutiable imports in total imports

declined to 37.1 per cent in 1997 from 39.6 per cent in

1996. A partial duty waiver of 10 per cent on imports of

petroleum products from mid January 1997, full and partial

duty waivers on imports of mass consumption items such as

sugar, rice, potatoes and onions and the downward revision

of tariff rates for bus chassis, timber, agricultural equipment,

books etc. were the major factors that slowed down the duty,

on imports. The average duty rate on total imports had

declined from 8.5 per cent in 1996 to 7.4 per cent in 1997,

while the effective duty rate on imports dropped from 20.6

per cent to 19.3 per cent. Accordingly, import duty

collection as a percentage of GDP declined from 3.3 per cent

in 1996 to 3.0 per cent in 1997.

Revenue from income taxes increased marginally in

1997. This was a net outcome of personal taxes increasing

by 9 per cent, collection from Save the Nation Contribution

(SNC) increasing from Rs.125 million to Rs.326 million and

corporate taxes decreasing by 6 per cent. As a percentage

of GDP income tax revenue dropped from 2.7 per cent in

1996 to 2.3 per cent in 1997. The increases in the investment

tax allowance and the depreciation allowance, together with

the other tax concessions granted to the corporate sector, and

the upward adjustments of income slabs for personal taxes

appear to have slowed down income tax collections.

Stamp duties increased by 47 per cent as a result of

adopting a sliding scale stamp duty system, the introduction

of a uniform stamp duty rate of 2 per cent across a wide

range of documents and the growth of imports. The full

impact of the reduction of stamp duty on pro-notes,

repurchase agreements relating to Treasury bills, mortgage

backed securities and mortgage bonds on lease agreements,

which came into effect from November 1997, will be felt

in 1998. Despite the unification of the dual type levy on

diesel vehicles at the lower level of Rs.5,000 from April

1997, revenue collected from the diesel and luxury tax and

other revenues under the Motor Traffic Act increased by 16

per cent due to the increase in the tax liable vehicle stock.

Taxes on Treasury bills purchased by the Central Bank

declined to Rs. 1,080 million in 1997 as against Rs. 1,604

million collected in 1996, reflecting the reduction in the

amount of Treasury bills purchased by the Central Bank and

lower interest rates on Treasury bills in 1997.

Non-Tax Revenue

Non tax revenue showed a sharp increase of 30 per cent

and accounted for 13 per cent of total revenue in 1997. This

helped to cover up part of the decline in tax revenues from

their expected levels. Non-tax revenue increased to 2.3 per

cent of GDP from 2.0 per cent in 1996. Increases were seen

in interest receipts, profits, dividends and levies. Interest

receipts, at Rs.7,752 million, registered an increase of 48 per

cent due to the timely payment of interest by institutions

such as the CEB (Rs.2,227 million), Sri Lanka Telecom

(Rs.2,470 million) and the NDB (Rs.l,229 million). The

receipts from profits, dividends and levies amounted to

115

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Rs.4,189 million in 1997 against Rs.2.321 million in 1996.

Bank of Ceylon transferred Rs.l,000 million, being

collections of repayments of part of the loans for which

restructuring bonds were issued in 1993 and part of the

interest on these bonds (Rs.636 million). Levies collected

under the Finance Act from Bank of Ceylon (Rs.400 million)

and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (Rs.400 million) also

contributed to the increase of this revenue in 1997. The

upward revision of charges on government publications,

registration fees and other administrative fees and the

increase in passport fees also helped to increase non-tax

revenues. The increase in the employees' contribution to the

W&OP by 1 percentage point and revenue sources such as

rent and national lotteries contributed to the substantial

increase in other non-tax revenue in 1997.

Foreign Grants

Total foreign grants received for budgetary purposes

during 1997 amounted to Rs.7,500 million, a 3 per cent

decrease compared to 1996. Grants as a percentage of GDP

have been declining and in 1997 these amounted to 0.8 per

cent of GDP. Receipts on account of project grants totalled

Rs.4,635 million and accounted for 62 per cent of the total

grants. Japan has been the largest donor of grants, accounting

for 32 per cent of the total grants in 1997.

8.4 Expenditure

Total government expenditure and net lending in 1997

at Rs.212362 million, declined by 0.7 per cent compared to

a 7 per cent increase in the previous year. Total expenditure

as a percentage of GDP continued to decline in 1997

recording 23.8 per cent compared to 30 per cent in 1995 and

to 27.8 in 1996. This was entirely due to the reduction in

net lending reflecting the higher privatisation proceeds

(Rs.22,535 million) which appear as a negative net lending.

Excluding privatisation proceeds, expenditure as a ratio of

GDP declined from 28.4 per cent in 1996 to 26.4 per cent

in 1997. The outcome of advance account operations was an

outpayment of Rs.l,226 million in 1997.

Due to the shortfall which occurred in the on lending

programme, public investment declined to 5.8 per cent of

GDP from 6.0 per cent in 1996. The growth of current

expenditure was contained at 5.5 per cent compared to 13.6

per cent in 1996. This was made possible due to the stricter

current expenditure controls including better management of

welfare expenditure. Transfers to public corporations

declined, reflecting lower expenditures on account of the

flour subsidy.

to 5.1 per cent in 1997. The expenditure on defence, salaries,

pensions and interest on public debt, inclusive of interest

payments on long term bonds issued to the two state banks

and the National Savings Bank (NSB), accounted for 79 per

Part 1. Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Interest on Rupee Loans in 1997 was Rs.30,021 million,

compared to Rs.23,201 million in 1996.. Rupee Loans

obtained in 1997 amounted to Rs.48,500 million and carried

an average interest rate of 12.93 per cent compared to 14.14

per cent in 1996. The maturity period of the new loans

decreased to 4.5 years from 5 years in 1996. The interest

rates on Treasury bonds ranged between 11.50 and 14.00 per

cent. The maturity periods were between 2 and 4 years. The

weighted average interest rate on these bonds was 12.50 per

cent. Interest on these bonds is paid half yearly and Rs.327

million was paid in 1997. During 1997, 12-month Treasury

bill interest rates ranged between 17.11 and 10.17 per cent

compared to 19.05 and 14.40 per cent in 1996. Interest

payments on account of Treasury bills increased marginally

to Rs.18,174 million. The increase was partly due to the

payment of Rs.325 million as interest on the Rs.10,000

million worth of Treasury bills retired in August 1997 for

which interest was otherwise due in 1998. Interest payments

The Government recognised the need to eliminate

anomalies and accepted most of the recommendations of the

Salaries Commission. The new salary scales were made

effective in 1997, allowing for 40 per cent of the increase

to take place in 1997. Thus the salary bill rose by 17 per

cent in 1997 and accounted for 24 per cent of the total

recurrent expenditure in 1997, compared to 22 per cent in

the previous two years.

Interest payments increased by 13 per cent in 1997 and

accounted for 30 per cent of current expenditure. Of the total

interest payments of Rs.55,246 million, Rs.6,227 million was

on account of the long-term bonds issued to the two banks

and the NSB. The value of the bonds issued during the

second half of 1996 to the two state banks and the NSB

amounted to Rs. 23,872 million at an interest rate of 14 per

cent per annum.

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

on foreign loans declined marginally and amounted to

Rs.6,265 million. The decline was partly a result of the

appreciation of the rupee against the Japanese yen. The

average rate of interest on the foreign debt stock in 1997

was 1.7 per cent compared to 1.8 per cent in 1996.

It is noteworthy that current transfers and subsidies

declined by 1 per cent in 1997 to Rs. 45,670 million,

compared to an increase of 14 per cent in 1996. The main

reason for this decrease was the reduction of wheat flour

subsidy payments to Rs.l,000 million, compared to Rs.5,515

million in 1996, as the price, of wheat flour was adjusted to

a non-subsidised price level of Rs.18.95 per kg. in 1997

from Rs.16.95 per kg. This was done in a situation when

international wheat prices were declining. The average

import price of wheat to the Go-operative Wholesale

Establishment (CWE) had declined to US dollars 166.98 per

metric ton, compared to US dollars 225.31 in 1996. With

the price adjustments, consumption declined by 11 per cent

to 616,799 metric tons.

The railway operations continued to incur losses. The

operational loss was estimated at Rs/712 million in 1997, a

decline from Rs.888 million in 1996. The Postal Department,

too made an operational loss of Rs.255 million in 1997,

compared to a loss of Rs.344 million in 1996. Payments

to other levels of government increased by 22 per cent to

Rs.l,941 million due to the new work programmes started

by the newly elected local bodies. Transfers to other public

institutions at Rs.2,657 million recorded an increase of 16

per cent in 1997. Transfers to public institutions set up to

deliver economic services recorded an increase of 19 per cent

compared to the 14 per cent increase recorded in the

transfers to institutions which deliver social services.

Pension payments increased by 16 per cent to Rs.17,916 million. This was mainly a result of the 5 per cent increase in pensions as announced in the Budget and the impact of the early retirement scheme.

Samurdhi payments-increased by 2 per cent to Rs.8,718

million. There were 1.9 million Samurdhi/Janasaviya welfare

recipient families and 31369 Samurdhi animators in 1997.

The fertiliser subsidy payments increased to Rs.l,895

million from Rs.l,500 million in 1996 due to the increased

subsidy component of urea under the new scheme announced

in October, 1997 to ensure that benefits are accrued to the

majority of small farmers. The price of urea was reduced

from Rs. 590 to Rs.350 per 50 kg.

Other transfers to households amounted to Rs.7,631 million, out of which, expenditure on refugees and drought relief payments amounted to Rs.3,357 million and Rs.548 million respectively.

Expenditure on other goods and services which

represent day-to-day operational expenditures, declined by 6

per cent, an achievement due to the 20 per cent cut in non-

priority expenditures as announced in the 1997 Budget.

According to the functional classification, current

expenditure on social services, which includes expenditure

on education, health, welfare and community services

declined to 6.7 per cent of GDP from 7.7 per cent in 1996.

These expenditures accounted for 32 per cent of total current

expenditure. Expenditure on education and health accounted

for 46 per cent of the total expenditure on social services,

an increase from 43 per cent in 1996.

Current expenditure on economic services declined by

16 per cent in 1997 to Rs.7,418 million. Expenditure on

transport and communication, trade and commerce,

agriculture and irrigation facilities, and energy and water,

supply indicated a decline.

Current expenditure on general public services increased

by 9 per cent to Rs.58,926 million. The expenditure on

defence and public order and safety accounted for 76 per

cent of the expenditure on general public services compared

to 81 per cent in 1996. As a percentage of GDP, the

expenditure on defence and public order and safety decreased

from 5.7 per cent in 1996 to 5.1 per cent in 1997.

Public Investment

Public investment, which includes capital expenditure

and on lending to public enterprises, increased by 12 per cent

to Rs.51,445 million. However, the expenditure was lower,

by 15 per cent, compared to budgeted expenditure. This was

due to implementation and procedural delays which led to

under utilisation of highly concessional foreign funds.

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) utilised Rs.3,479 million on account of on-going projects out of Rs.4,441 million allocated in the 1997 Budget. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Sri Lanka Telecom received Rs.984 million and Rs.l,367 million, respectively. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority utilised only 19 per. cent of the bnlending allocation of Rs. 5,300 million. Sri Lanka Telecom utilised 66 per cent of the total allocation of Rs. 2,081 million. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and other projects such as agro based commercial projects received Rs.692 million as against the expected Rs.493 million in 1997. In addition, the Government released Rs.750 million to the household sector through loan schemes such as 'Surathura Diriya' and self-employment credit schemes.

Capital transfers to corporations amounted to Rs.5,880

million (National Water Supply and Drainage Board -

Rs.2,513 million; CEB -Rs.811 million; The Sri Lanka Land

119

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Reclamation and Development Corporation -Rs.l,746 million;

National Housing Development Authority -Rs.454 million)

compared to Rs.6,017 million in 1996.

Capital transfers to other public institutions increased by 15 per cent to Rs. 11,041 million. Of this total, 79 per cent was for economic services such as transport, communication, agriculture and irrigation. Transfers to the Road Development Authority (RDA) increased by 32 per cent to Rs.5,826 million. The Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka received Rs.l,626 million. The Urban Development Authority also received a sum of Rs.511 million in 1997. Capital transfers for social services increased by 65 per cent to Rs. 1,836 million. The Samurdhi Authority received Rs.936 million, and the National Development Trust Fund received Rs.453 million.

The Government also spent Rs. 2,193 million as cost of restructuring. Reflow of funds to the Government as repayments on account of past on lending amounted to Rs.4,713 million.

per cent, owing to the slowing down of property transactions.

Revenues from fees and charges, consisting of court' fees and

fees and charges under the Motor Traffic Act. increased by

15 per cent mainly due to improvements in collection

procedures and increases in rates.

8.5 Provincial Councils

The revenue collections of Provincial Councils (PCs)

increased by 10 per cent to Rs.5,395 million. These were

sufficient to meet 23 per cent of their resource requirement,

as in the previous year. Their expenditure increased by 6 per

cent to Rs.23,455 million. This resulted in an overall deficit

of Rs.18348 millionin 1997, compared to Rs.16,873 million

in 1996. The entire deficit was financed through Central

Government transfers, of which block grants or current

transfers accounted for 92 per cent. The balance was in the

form of criteria based grants and matching grants for capital

projects.

Revenue

Taxes on production and expenditure increased by 10 per cent to Rs.3,743 million and accounted for 69 per cent of the total revenue. Most of these revenues were in the form of turnover taxes and licence fees. Turnover tax at rates ranging from 1 per cent to 5 per cent were collected on wholesale and retail businesses. Turnover tax collections increased by 11 per cent compared to a 6 per cent increase in 1996, reflecting the growth of wholesale and retail businesses in 1997. Licence fee collections increased by 5 per cent compared to 17 per cent in 1996, reflecting the slow growth in the registrations of vehicles and new issues of liquor licences in 1997. As the tax rate structure on production and expenditure remained as in 1996, expansion of the tax base led to the increase in revenue.

The collection of stamp duty, which was the second

largest revenue source for PCs, increased marginally by 1

The Western, Central, Southern and North-Western PCs

accounted for about 90 per cent of total revenue, while the

North-East Province accounted for less than I per cent.

Expenditure

Most of the expenditure (94 per cent) by PCs was

current expenditure. Current expenditure increased by 6 per

cent, while capital expenditure showed a larger increase of

19 per cent.

Current Expenditure

The expenditure on account of personal emoluments (salaries, wages, overtime and holiday payments, cost of living allowance and other allowances) rose by 5 per cent, reflecting the increase in salaries of government employees from January 1997. Payments to those in education (Rs.12,094 million), health (Rs.3,054 million) and divisional administration (Rs.545 million) accounted for 92 per cent of total personal emoluments in 1997. The growth of other recurrent expenses (such as travelling, supplies, contractual services and current transfers) was contained at 6 per cent compared to an increase of 24 per cent in 1996. This was the result of strict discipline enforced by the Treasury in cash management.

Recurrent expenditure on social services (education,

health and other social activities) rose by 5 per cent and

accounted for 87 per cent of the total current expenditure

in 1997. Recurrent expenditure on economic services

increased by 4 per cent, while expenditure on administration

increased by 9 per cent in 1997.

The total current expenditure of the Western PC, at

Rs.5,307 million, accounted for 24 per cent of total current

expenditure of all PCs, followed by the Central PC (14 per

cent), the North East PC (14 per cent), the Southern PC (13

per cent), North West PC (12 per cent), the Sabaragamuwa

PC (9 per cent), the' North Central PC (7 per cent) and the

Uva PC (7 per cent).

Capital Expenditure

Capital outlays on equipment, structural and land improvement, at Rs.729 million, accounted for 52 per cent of total capital expenditure, down from 64 per cent in the previous year due to a sharp increase of capital outlays on other programmes implemented on the directives of Provincial Council Members in 1997. PCs have taken over some capital projects from the respective line ministries. The total value of these projects amounts to Rs.3,047 million, of which health (Rs.711 million), highways (Rs.707 million), education (Rs.661 million) and contribution to the Integrated

Rural Development Programme (IRDP) (Rs.888 million) represented 97 per cent of the total. Of this the Southern PC, at Rs. 917 million, accounted for 30 per cent of the total expenditure while the shares of other PCs ranged between 4 - 13 per cent of the total. Funds for these capital projects' were provided through the Medium Term Investment Programme (MTIP) of the respective ministries.

8.6 Public Enterprise Reforms

The Public Enterprise Reform Programme generated Rs.22,535 million, contributing to 12 per cent of total receipts of the Government in 1997, enabling the government to retire part of the public debt and restructure its debt portfolio. This helped to reduce the interest cost but the full effect on interest cost will be felt in 1998 and beyond.

A major step forward in the public enterprise reform programme was the sale of a 35 per cent stake in Sri Lanka Telecom Limited to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone

121

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Corporation (NTT) of Japan for Rs.13,274 million (US dollars 225 million). The accompanying management contract with NTT was another vital step towards improving the operational efficiency • of Sri Lanka Telecom. The Government also earmarked 3.5 per cent of shares of Sri Lanka Telecom for its employees.

The sale of convertible debentures of the National Development Bank (NDB) held by the Government generated Rs.4,500 million. The transaction was the largest single public offering made through the Colombo Stock Exchange. Convertible debentures of NDB amounting to Rs. 275 million, which had been issued to the Government in January 1993, were divested. The convertible debentures, which were to mature in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were converted into 18.33 million ordinary shares at a par value of Rs. 10 per share and offered to the market through the Colombo Stock Exchange. As the issue was too large to be absorbed by the domestic market, 16.5 million shares were offered abroad, while 916,667 shares were offered to domestic investors. The remaining 916,666 shares were purchased by the NDB for its employee Stock Ownership Plan. The international issue was priced at Rs. 260 per share and the domestic issue was priced at Rs. 250 per share.

The divestiture of 51 per cent of shares each of seven plantation companies (Namunukula Plantations Limited, Maturata Plantations Limited, Malwatte Valley Plantations Limited, .Kahawatte Plantations Limited, Elpitiya Plantations Limited, Talawakelle Plantations Limited, and Pussellawa Plantations Limited) were completed. Proceeds realised from this amounted to Rs.2,914 million. Public share issues for the divestiture of 19 per cent of each of five plantation companies, namely, Bogawantalawa Plantations Limited, Kegalle Plantations Limited, Agalawatte Plantations Limited, Horana Plantations Limited and Kelani Valley Plantations Limited, contributed Rs. 635 million. Public share issues for the divestiture of 20 per cent each of Watawala Plantations Limited and Maskeliya Plantations Limited added Rs. Ill million to Government revenue in 1997.

The sale of 90 per cent of shares of Lanka Salt Limited

and Puttalam Salt Limited generated Rs. 575 million, while

the public share issue of 17.33 per cent of shares of Lanka

Ceramic Limited generated Rs. 206 million in 1997.

Mattegama Textile Mill Limited was acquired by the. . Government as a failed privatised public enterprise. This was re-divested through the sale of the entire ownership for

ensuring employment for about 900 persons.

8.7 Financing the Budget Deficit

The budget deficit (after grants) was estimated at Rs.

39,997 million in 1997, compared to Rs.59,914 million in

1996. Net borrowings from domestic sources (Rs. 30.275

million) financed 76 per cent of the budget deficit compared

with 83 per cent in 1996. Net domestic financing as a

percentage of GDP declined from 6.5 per cent in 1996 to

3.4 per cent in 1997 with a net repayment to the domestic

banking system, as compared to bank financing amounting

to 1.7 per cent of GDP in 1996.

Gross foreign borrowings, at Rs.22,973 million, showed

an increase of 11 per cent in 1997. Gross disbursement on

foreign borrowings, excluding borrowings raised through the

Floating Rate Notes (FRN) issue of US dollars 50 million

(equivalent to Rs.2,901 million), were 27 per cent below the

amount budgeted for 1997. The major reasons for the

reduction of aid utilisation were delays in project

implementation particularly in the areas of ports, power and

energy sectors etc. and lack of domestic resources to absorb

foreign funds. Repayments on account of foreign loans

increased by 26 per cent to Rs.13,251 million. Net foreign

borrowings amounting to 1.1 per cent of GDP were available

for deficit financing jn 1997 compared to 1.4 per cent in the

previous year. Net foreign borrowings from bilateral and

multi-lateral sources amounted to Rs.9,784 million, while

other sources including the FRN issue reported a net

repayment of Rs.62 million. Out of the total project aid

loans, the Asian Development Bank (Rs. 4,499 million),

International Development Association (Rs.3,676 million) and

Government of Japan (Rs.3,629 million) provided 71 per cent

in 1997.

Net borrowing through Rupee Loans amounted to Rs.33,500 million, compared to Rs.24,154 million in the previous year. The Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and the National Savings Bank (NSB) have contributed to 84 per cent of total Rupee Loans. Net investment by the EPF on Rupee Securities grew by 6 per cent to Rs.17.588 million in 1997 in addition to the new investments in Treasury bonds. Net investments by the NSB in Rupee Loans rose from Rs.4,919 million in 1996 to Rs.10,655 million in 1997. The NSB has shifted its investment in government securities towards Rupee Securities.

The new, market based Treasury bonds introduced to

the market in March 1997 became popular. The Government

raised Rs.10,000 million during the period from March to

December 1997 through Treasury bonds. With the

improvement in the fiscal situation and the changing market

conditions, the interest rate on Treasury bonds declined.

Accordingly, the coupon rate on Treasury bonds was

gradually revised downward from 14.0 per cent to 11.5 per

cent. The EPF (Rs.3,100 million) and the NSB (Rs.l,609

million) contributed to 47 per cent of Treasury bonds while

the balance was purchased by other investors. Commercial

banks purchased Rs. 1,788 million or 18 per cent of the

Treasury bonds.

The marked improvement on the fiscal front that narrowed the resource gap in 1997, mainly due to large inflows of privatisation proceeds, enabled the Government to retire part of its high cost debt held with the banking system. The retirement of Treasury bills held with the Central Bank amounted to Rs.10,000 million (face value). In addition, the settlements were made to the two state banks. The net impact of these operations resulted in an overall repayment of Rs.2,172 million to the banking system in 1997 compared to net borrowings of Rs.l3,090 million from the banking system in the previous year. The financing of the deficit through the Central Bank declined by Rs.13,991 million, which was a larger reduction than the initial retirement of Treasury bills. Net credit to Government from commercial banks amounted to Rs.l 1,618 million due to banks investing most of the funds released through the reduction of statutory reserve requirements, in Treasury bills. Government deposits held with the banking system at end 1997 totalled Rs.20,206 million, consisting of Rs.6,467 million with the Central Bank and Rs.13,739 million with commercial banks.

8.8 Government Debt

Government debt at the end of 1997 stood at

Rs.758,714 million, recording an increase of 7 per cent. The

total debt/GDP ratio declined to 85 per cent in 1997

compared to 92 per cent in 1996. This is a favourable trend

observed since 1993. The total domestic debt accounted for

123

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

50 per cent of the total government debt. The level of

domestic debt and foreign debt increased by. 10 per cent and

5 per cent in 1997 respectively.

Domestic Debt

The debt structure improved significantly with the issue

of Treasury bonds, issue of Rupee Loans with options of

early retirement, and a reduction in the level of short-term

debt. This made the debt structure more flexible and yield

determination more market oriented. Of the total domestic

debt, short-term debt, at Rs. 133,303 million, declined to 35

per cent at the end of 1997 from 41 per cent at the end of

1996. Treasury bills accounted for 86 per cent of the short-

term debt. Interest rates on Treasury bills declined sharply

in 1997. At the beginning of the year, the weighted average

yield rates on 3,6, and 12 month Treasury bills were 17.14,

17.03 and 17.11 per cent, while at the end of the year these

rates had dropped to 9.97,10.09 and 10.21 per cent,

respectively. Central Bank provisional advances, which

accounted for the balance 14 per cent of short -term debt,

increased by 3 per cent to Rs. 18,307 million at the end of

1997.

Medium and long-term debt (including long-term

restructuring bonds) increased by 21 per cent and accounted

for 65 per cent of the total domestic debt in 1997. Treasury

bonds accounted for 4 per cent of the total outstanding

medium and long-term debt. Commercial banks, the EPF and

savings institutions have purchased 33 per cent, 32 per cent

and 18 per cent, respectively, of the total Treasury bond

issues, leaving 17 per cent for all other investors. The

balance of the medium and long-term debt stock consisted

almost entirely of Rupee Loans. The bulk of the domestic

resource requirement of the Government was met through the

Rupee Loans, which mobilized Rs. 48,500 million. There

were 17 series of Rupee Loans floated in 1997, with the

maturity periods varying from 2-8 years. The interest rate

on Rupee Loans was adjusted downward in line with the

anticipated decline in inflation, while a relatively higher rate

of interest was offered for Rupee Loans with longer maturity,

giving them a slight edge over short-term instruments.

Accordingly, Rupee Loans issued during the first quarter of

the year carried an annual interest rate of 14.5 per cent. The

rates were gradually reduced to 11.25 per cent by the end

of the year. Over 35 per cent of the Rupee Loans were

floated with optional maturities of 6-7 years, while about 53

per cent of the issues were with maturities of 2-4 years. The

EPF and the NSB continued to be the two main subscribers

to the Rupee Loan programme. These two institutions

contributed 64 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively. Total

investments in Rupee Loans by others amounted to Rs. 5,741

million, consisting of ETF (Rs. 2,454 million), insurance

corporations (Rs.l ,500 million), the Ports Authority (Rs. 750

million), PSPF (Rs. 923 million) and other public institutions

(Rs. 114 million).

The outstanding liability on account of Treasury

Certificates of Deposits (TCD). decreased from Rs. 212

million at end 1996 to Rs.83 million at end 1997 and

became relatively insignificant in the Government's debt

portfolio. In 1997. TCDs were issued with a maturity period

of 12 months and yield rate of 18.06 per cent, of which 3

per cent was charged as stamp duty. The liability on Tax

Reserve Certificates (TRC) remained very small at Rs.7

million at the end of 1997.

Chart 8.6 Composition of Debt

Foreign Debt

The outstanding foreign debt increased by 5 per cent

to Rs.375,752 million at the end of 1997. Gross borrowings

amounted to Rs.24,406 million. The expenditure on debt

repayment amounted to Rs. 10.004 million. The outstanding

liability also increased by Rs. 1,959 million due to exchange

rate variations.

The total level of concessional loans increased by 4 per

cent to Rs.361,430 million. The share of concessional debt

in total foreign debt recorded a marginal reduction to 96 per

cent compared with 97 per cent at the end of 1996. Bilateral

debt, at Rs.188,165 million, accounted for 52 per cent of

concessional loans, while the balance Rs. 173,265 million or

48 per cent were liabilities to multilateral agencies. The issue

of Floating Rate Notes added to the stock of non-

concessional debt.

The' outstanding stock of project and programme loans stood at Rs.320,547 million at the end of 1997, showing an increase of 6 per cent. Approximately 80 per cent of the project and programme loans were obtained from bilateral and multilateral sources. The outstanding liability on commodity loans recorded a decrease of Rs.l,427 million to

Interest payments on domestic debt rose by 15 per cent

to Rs.48,555 million in 1997. Interest payments on Rupee

Loans increased by 29 per cent to Rs.30,021 million,

reflecting a heavy dependency on the Rupee Loan

programme for financing the budget deficit, and the cost of

restructuring bonds issued during the second half of 1996.

Interest on Treasury bonds was only Rs.327 million. Interest

payments on medium and long-term debt rose by 29 per cent

in 1997, indicating the higher reliance on medium-term

borrowings at higher interest for deficit financing in recent

years. Interest payments on short-term debt, at Rs.l8,174

million, increased marginally by 1 per cent. Despite the

significant reduction in interest rates on Treasury bills, the

interest cost increased due to the large issues of more 3-

month and 6-month Treasury bills in 1997 in addition to the

early interest payment on retired Treasury biil stock. Interest

payments on foreign debt declined by Rs. 47 million to Rs.

6,692 million.

Rs.53,816 million in 1997. In addition to new bonowings

and repayment, exchange rate variations reduced the debt

stock by Rs.765 million. All commodity loans were from

bilateral sources (USA, Japan, Netherlands, Germany, Canada

etc.) and were received on concessionary terms.

Government Debt Service Payments

The debt service payments of the Government, at

Rs.92,519 million, consisting of Rs. 37,272 million of

amortisation payments and Rs.55,247 million of interest

payments, registered an increase of Rs.l 1,256 million or 14

per cent in 1997. This was the total outcome of an increase

in amortisation payments by Rs.4,032 million and an increase

in interest payments by Rs.7,224 million. However, debt

service payments as a ratio of GDP declined from 10.6 per

cent in 1996 to 10.4 per cent in 1997. The amortisation

payments of domestic and foreign loans in 1997 amounted

to Rs.24,021 million and Rs.13,251 million, respectively.
