Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

5. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OVERHEADS

5.1 Overview

The Government has been the provider of most

economic and social infrastructure services in Sri Lanka.

Public investment in this area has been declining over the

last fifteen years in the wake of increased resource

constraints due to the growth in security expenditure and

structural weaknesses of the budget from both revenue and

expenditure sides. Total public investment on economic and

social infrastructure has declined from 16.5 per cent of GDP

in 1980 to 5.0 per cent of GDP in 1997. As a per cent of

total government expenditure, infrastructure investment

declined from 36.1 per cent in 1980 to 18.9 per cent by

1997. Meanwhile, it is increasingly recognized that many

economic infrastructure services are not'public goods and

that these could be provided more efficiently through the

private sector. The policy environment for private sector

participation in economic infrastructure has been strengthened

through a general improvement in the macro economic

conditions as well as through the privatisation programme.

In addition, various fiscal incentives such as import duty

exemptions for project related imports, income tax holidays

and provision of government land for the building of relate'd

infrastructure have been granted during the past few years

to attract private investment to these sectors. To provide

financial support, the Private Sector Infrastructure

Development Company Ltd. was established in 1997, with

the assistance of the World Bank. The private sector has

gradually entered this field in some areas such as health,

education, postal services, mass media, telecommunication,

transport etc. on its own initiative as well as a result of the

Government's conscious policy of promoting private sector

led growth. Despite all these efforts, the current levels of

investment in these sectors are still inadequate. Considerable

improvement is necessary in key areas such as roads, the

transport network including railways, supply of energy, ports,

arid social infrastructure, over and above what has already

been achieved.

In 1997, attempts were made to enhance private sector

participation in economic infrastructure, improve commercial

viability and expand existing infrastructure stock. The power

generating capacity of the national electricity grid was

increased by 177 MW of thermal power, the first increase

during the past five years, thereby reducing the reliance on

hydro power and improving the reliability of the power

supply. Coverage of telecommunication facilities was

enhanced greatly with increased participation by the private

sector. Restructuring of Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd. progressed

further in an open and competitive manner with the

divestiture of 35 per cent of the shares of the company to a

strategic partner. Negotiations were in progress to expand the

existing capacity of the Colombo Port with private sector

participation on a BOO/BOT basis. Addressing prolonged

management deficiencies in the transport sector, peoplised

bus companies were restructured to form 1.1 cluster

companies during the second half of the year.

Vital policy reforms were introduced in respect of the

education sector in order to develop a sustainable education

system, which is suitable for the contemporary needs of

society. With a view to improving the efficiency of the

health care delivery mechanism and addressing the emerging

issues in the sector, policy reforms have been suggested

during the year by a Presidential Task Force.

Despite these favourable developments on the supply side, the growing demand for economic infrastructure, particularly for transport, telecommunication, housing and water supply, created a mismatch, exerting extra pressure on the existing facilities. In view of the growing demand for port services, a comprehensive port development programme has been proposed which will help to expand the capacity and to improve the efficiency of port services and management of the ports (Box 3). The proposed plan, when implemented, is expected to enhance competitiveness and Sri Lanka's market share. In the case of transport, close monitoring and supervision of Regional Transport Companies is essential to avoid any recurrence of managerial deficiencies and to improve commercial viability. Similarly, early and prompt implementation of the proposed refonns with respect to the education and health sectors is needed to reap the expected benefits. Adequate allocation of

64

Part 1 Central .Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

resources is a pre-requisite for the success of these reforms.

There is also a need to further improve the targetting of

benefits under existing welfare programmes with a view to

ensuring that benefits are granted only to the deserving.

Private investment in economic infrastructure increased in

1997. The Government maintained its investment, as a

percentage of GDP, in the case of social services. Investment

in economic services increased marginally in 1997.

52 Health

The country has been able to maintain and preserve the

earlier achievements in the health sector without a serious

setback. The demand for health services has been rising

sharply, not only due to the natural growth of population,

but also due to emerging and re-emerging diseases, the

presence of a large number of casualties and disabled persons

as a result of the civil war and a relative ageing in the

population. The health status is also threatened by diseases

associated with poor environmental conditions. The re-

emergence of cholera and continuous occurrence of Dengue,

Japanese Encephalitis, Malaria etc. emerged as the most

serious hazards to the health status of the people. Meanwhile,

non-communicable diseases that emerge with the transition

in the demographic profile and improvement in life styles

are also on the increase, indicating the possible health

expenditure burdens that could occur in the foreseeable

future. A marked increase in mental disorders, drug and

alcohol dependence, suicide rates and poisoning are some

adverse developments that have emerged in the health sector,

which require serious attention. Newly emerging diseases

such as HIV/AIDS also further threatens the health status of

the country compelling the Government to allocate more

resources for control and awareness campaigns. Heart

diseases, cancer, liver diseases and pesticide poisoning

continued to be the leading causes of mortality in the

country.

In the context of the emerging health situation, the major thrust of the health policy in 1997 was to consolidate the earlier achievements and further improve the health status of the people, through an efficient health care delivery mechanism. Maternal and child health care, nutritional deficiencies, poverty related diseases, Malaria, problems of the elderly, mental health, suicide, heart diseases, physical disabilities and diabetes were identified as the priority areas, which required attention. The key strategies were the promotion of preventive health care, equitable allocation of resources among regions, a rational drug policy and promotion of health research.

The need for promoting the private sector in

accommodating the growing demand for health services was

duly recognised and strong incentives were offered, signalling

the vision for the health sector in the foreseeable future. As

it appeared that the existing health care delivery mechanism

had not effectively addressed the emerging issues in the

health sector, a Presidential Task Force was appointed in

1997. in order to prepare an action plan for the heath sector

and to make recommendations to address the glaring issues

in the sector. The major areas of concern identified by the

Task Force were identification and prioritisation of health

needs, services required to meet the health services of the

community, organisation and the management of the health

sector and mobilisation of resources for the health sector.

Some of the recommendations made by the Task Force were

the setting up of a National Health Commission, setting up

of a regulatory and institutional framework to monitor private

sector health care, effective decentralisation of health sector

activities, allocation of resources based on regional needs,

improvement in revenue, earning capabilities of health

institutions, enhancing regulatory powers, offering incentives

to work in rural areas, restructuring existing health

institutions etc. A Unit to implement the recommendations

made by the Task Force has already been set up in the

Ministry of Health. Initial steps were taken to establish a

National Health Commission empowered with more

regulatory authority to. design, direct and implement health

policies and co-ordinate and monitor health related activities

between Provincial Councils and the Ministry. Action has

been taken to draft the' Medical Institutions Act giving

powers to the Ministry of Health to monitor the operations

and quality of the services provided by the private sector.

The effectiveness of the recommended reforms will rely

largely on their early implementation, with close monitoring

of procedures.

sector increased marginally to Rs.2,554 million. Total

expenditure in relation to GDP declined from l .5 per cent

to 1.4 per cent between the two years. More than three

fourths of the resources were spent on maintenance of health

infrastructure, while the balance was spent on new

investment. Considering both the need to further consolidate

the recent macroeconomic achievements and the compelling

need to allocate more resources for preventive health care,

it is of paramount importance to implement an efficient

health care management system early. Exploitation of the

revenue earning potential of public health institutions and

improvement of the operational efficiency of large institutions

by giving them more autonomy to be run as separate entities,

are some effective measures to be considered in this regard.

Ensuring the quality of drugs, as well as timely availability,

is also considered a crucial issue that, needs'to be addressed

on a priority basis.

In general, oyer 3 million in-patients and 36 million

out-patients are treated annually in the 540 government

hospitals. The average number of beds available per 1,000

persons increased from 2.8 to 3.0 jn 1997. A total of 3,926

health personnel, including 1,063 intern and post intern

medical officers, were recruited during the year under review.

The availability of doctors improved from 24 to 29 per

10,000 population, while the nursing staff strength improved

from 76 to 86 per 10,000 population between the two years.

A wide disparity in the regional distribution of health

personnel, with a high concentration in the Colombo District

and an acute shortage of specialist doctors continued to be

major problems in 1997.

Public investment in health infrastructure was further

strengthened in 1997. Initial steps were taken to construct a

National Nurses Training School with JICA assistance at the

Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital with a capacity to train 300

nurses per year. The estimated cost of the project is Rs.722

million. Construction work on a ten storied building complex

for the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH), with a bed capacity

of 390, was in progress during the year and the estimated

cost of this project is Rs.320 million. An agreement was

signed with the Korean Government to improve the patient

care services of the Base Hospitals at Gampaha and

Negombo at a cost of Rs.224 million and to provide clinical

facilities for teaching medical students at the Colombo South

Teaching Hospital at a cost of Rs.108 million. The Health

and Population Project funded by the Asian Development

Bank at a cost of Rs.l,259 million was in progress to

improve the health care system in rural areas. A health

service project at a cost of US dollars 22.6 million funded

by IDA was also initiated in 1997. This aims at eradicating

Malaria, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), malnutrition

among lower income groups and promoting health education.

A Population and Reproductive Health Programme, funded

by the UNFPA, was also started this year.

Strenuous efforts were made to preserve the earlier

gains achieved in the field of primary health care and to

restrain the adverse impact of emerging outbreaks of disease

to a minimum level..The immunisation coverage of infants

against the six vaccine preventable diseases was sustained at

a high level (above 90 per cent) during the year under

review. The National Immunisation Programme for Polio' was

conducted for the third consecutive year and was able to

cover almost the entire child population under 5 years.

During the year, the Rubella Immunisation Programme was

further extended, covering five provinces. A fresh outbreak

of cholera, the first after 1993. caused 12 deaths and 412

reported cases by end 1997. An efficient disease surveillance

system, together with effective awareness programmes

contained the outbreak to a large extent. Despite the

implementation of the National Dengue Control Programme

and various awareness programmes, the recurrence of

Dengue since 1989 has continued to be a major problem and

more than 1,000 cases were reported in 1996 as well as in

1997. The incidence of Japanese Encephalitis was reduced

in 1997, while the vaccination programme was extended to

the Colombo, Kalutara and Gampaha Districts. Malaria still

continues to be a major health problem in Sri Lanka.

Despite the various control activities undertaken, the

incidence of Malaria continued to increase by 19 per cent

to 218,544 cases confirming the trends observed in the

previous year. The main reasons for the setback were the

operational problems encountered in carrying out control

activities in war affected areas and the large influx of

refugees to neighbouring areas. With a view to controlling

Tuberculosis, a new method, DOT (Directly Observed

Therapy) has been initiated in selected districts under the

respiratory diseases control programme. Screening,

counselling, surveillance and dissemination of information

about STD are the major strategies adopted by the STD/

AIDS control programme.

Private Sector Health Care

An efficient private health care system, which is

competitive and complementary to state health services is

long overdue, considering the ever growing demand for

health services and the capacity limitations and inefficiencies

in the public sector health services. A well established

regulatory framework, a rational incentive structure, an

affordable price and a clear and convincing vision of where

the health system should be moving are key elements for its

success. Having recognised these needs, initial steps have

been taken during the year to make private sector health care

more acceptable to the community and attractive to investors.

Exemption of health services from turnover taxes and GST,

66

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

exemption of medical equipment from import duty and

reduction of import duty on drugs were introduced with a

view to lowering the cost of medical bills as well as the cost

of investment. The proposal to provide free land for private

hospitals and exempt them from taxes for a reasonable

period will further attract investors into this area.

According to Health Ministry sources, the private sector

presently caters to about 50 per cent of the total patient load,

while the provision of in-patient care is still insignificant

compared to the public health sector. The services are

provided through a general practitioner network and an

institutional network covering private hospitals and nursing

homes. According to the Ministry, at present, there are 118

private hospitals with a bed, capacity of 2,467. More than

half of these hospitals is located in the Western Province.

According to a survey covering 23 private hospitals carried

out by the Central Bank (1996), in-patient as well as outÂ­

patient services provided by these hospitals were less than

5 per cent of the total number of in-patients and out-patients

handled by the government hospitals. These private hospitals

had a bed capacity of 1,300 and, in respect of all major

hospitals, the bed occupancy ratio was almost 80 per cent.

There are 103 permanent doctors, 222 part-time doctors,

1,479 nurses and 280 technicians serving in these hospitals.

However, of these hospitals, 9 major hospitals, including two

in the outstations, accounted for more than 75 per cent of

the total bed capacity, 84 per cent of the nursing staff

strength and 95 per cent of the technical staff strength.

Extensive consultancy services were also provided in almost

all hospitals. However, private sector participation in health

services is plagued by some major problems such as the high

cost of infrastructure, high cost of health care, a shortage of

qualified and skilled personnel and low quality of service.

5.3 Education

The need to establish a sustainable education system,

which will effectively respond to the private sector needs,

has been strongly felt over the last two decades. Addressing

some of the issues, but only in some specific areas, various

policy measures have been introduced from time to time over

the last 20 years. Nevertheless, most of these measures did

not yield positive results and some were short lived, as they

were not designed as a comprehensive package that would

address all the issues in the sector simultaneously. Having

recognised this need, a set of far reaching educational

reforms was introduced in 1997 to address the crucial issues

in the sector, such as low quality, low efficiency and little

relevance of educational attainment to labour market

requirements. The core of the new educational reforms is the

identification of competence and development of practical

skills of students and promotion of those skills. The key

strategies are the improvement and expansion in qualitative

and quantitative inputs, strengthening teacher education and

improvement in organisation and management of the schools

system. A special unit has been set up in the Ministry of

Education to implement and direct the reforms relevant to

general education. Early and timely implementation of the

proposed reforms with proper monitoring procedures is

essential to reduce the mismatch between labour market

requirements and educational attainment. Adequate allocation

of resources to provide qualitative and quantitative inputs are

prerequisites for effective implementation of the proposed

reforms. Nevertheless, as the sustainability of the reforms

would depend entirely on the commitment and quality of the

teaching staff, teacher education and deployment issues have

to be addressed on a priority basis.

Reforms of General Education

The reforms are focussed on five major areas, namely, extension of educational opportunities, improvement in quality of education, improvement in quality of teaching strength and rationalisation of the profession, development of technical and practical skills and improvement in organisation and management of education.

A proposal has been made to enforce compulsory

education regulations under the new reforms, aiming at

improving school participation rates. In 1997, an all island

survey was launched to identify the magnitude of non-

participation to take remedial action.

Quality improvement in education is expected to be undertaken at four different levels: pre-school, primary level, junior secondary and senior secondary stages. These are to be achieved through syllabus revisions, provision of teaching materials, provision of quantitative inputs such as buildings

67

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

and activity rooms, teacher training, classroom assessment

etc. These changes will require additional resources. In the

area of primary education, a child-centered, competency-

based education system, which will provide learning through

activities, will be established. The new curriculum is to be

introduced for Year 1 in schools in the Gampaha District

from 1998. The junior secondary stage education is designed

to lead towards subject based curricula and learning through

projects. Practical work is to be emphasised in the teaching

methodology. The senior secondary stage of education will

aim at expanding available opportunities and developing

skills of students in various fields. The duration of the GCE

Ordinary Level programme will be two years. The present

curricula will be made more flexible by introducing a

number of core and optional subjects. The GCE Advanced

Level curriculum is to be redesigned, providing a variety of

further educational and work opportunities. A new

technological stream will be introduced and the choice of

subjects across the different streams is to be made more

flexible.

The training of all teachers in service by the year 2000

and the provision of pre-service training for all new recruits

are expected under the programme. With a view to planning,

monitoring and co-ordinating teacher training activities, a

National Authority for Teacher Education is to be

established. Special programmes will be carried out to

strengthen teaching abilities in English and technology. The

number of Colleges of Education will be increased to 14 to

meet the future demand. Attempts will be made to have a

rationalised school structure with the re-organisation of

schools on the basis of a school mapping exercise,

development of senior secondary schools, development of

schools in disadvantaged areas, school-based management,

performance appraisal of teachers, external supervision etc.

General Education

Public expenditure on infrastructure development in education has been relatively low due to resource constraints. This has declined further in 1997 to 0.5 per cent of GDP from 0.6 per cent in 1996. In absolute terms, total Government expenditure on education increased from Rs.20,402 million in 1996 to Rs.22349 million in 1997. A sum of Rsl ,798 million was spent for the distribution of free school text books, free uniform materials and the provision of concessionary travel facilities, for school children. With respect to the composition of expenditure on education, a high wage bill (75 per cent of total current expenditure on education and 25 per cent of the total salary bill) largely limited the allocation of resources for essential inputs such as teaching materials, equipment, supplies and other . maintenance. A higher allocation of resources to the education sector, with increased commitment to provide

quality inputs, would be necessary to reap the expected

benefits from the educational reforms.

In 1997, there were 10,216 government schools with a

student population of 4,123,656 and a teaching staff strength

of 181,050. The availability of a school network and teaching

staff strength was extensive and favourable, with one school

for every 6 sq.km. and 23 students per teacher.

Nevertheless, the beneficial effects that could have been

obtained from the extensive infrastructure network are largely

undermined by a number of factors. First, there are wide

regional inequalities in the availability of educational

facilities and deficiencies of resources in certain subject

areas. Second, the lower productivity of the teacher force,

which resulted from weak recruitment polices in the past,

was further aggravated by over generous retirement policies

adopted in 1996 and 1997 allowing experienced and trained

teachers to leave. Finally, under-investment in quality inputs

has led to an acute shortage of adequate equipment and

materials to match curriculum needs, thereby lowering the

quality of education. According to a project appraisal report

for the Second General Education Project prepared by the

IDA, it is estimated that required quality inputs are available

only in less than 20 per cent of the schools and that about

80 per cent of schools have no permanent libraries.

Addressing some of these crucial issues in the education sector, a number of foreign-funded projects were continued during the year. With a view to promoting quality improvements in the education sector, the General Education Project II funded by the IDA. was commissioned in 1997 at a cost of US dollars 83.4 million. The main areas of concern were curricula development, text books and educational publications, school rationalisation, quality inputs, library development, education management etc. In order to improve' secondary education in the schools in the 1AB (those with GCE advanced level - Science, Commerce & Arts streams) and 1C (those with GCE advanced level without Science) categories, the Secondary Education Development Project funded by the ADB at a cost of US dollars 40 million was continued during the year. The Primary School Development Project, which aims at developing the quality of education in the remote rural primary schools, funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), was also in progress. Another project, titled the Plantation Sector Education Development Project, funded by the SIDA, has also been launched. The improvement in the quality of teaching and the learning environment in schools, equitable deployment of teachers and the rationalisation of teacher education institutions are the key objectives of the Teachers Education and Teacher Deployment Project which commenced in August 1996. The total cost of the project is estimated at US dollars 79.3 million. In order to co-ordinate training activities among

68

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

various teacher training institutions, a proposal to set up a National Authority for Teacher Education was submitted to the Parliament. A primary English language project and a primary mathematics project financed by the British International Development Agency (BIDA) was in progress during the year. The Project for Development of Schools by Divisional Secretariat Level has identified a total of 317 schools to be developed and a sum of Rs.210 million was spent in 1997.

Initial steps have been taken to install computer systems

at provincial ministries under the Education Management

Information System (EMIS). During the first eight months

of 1997, 1,893 teachers were admitted to the Teacher

Training Colleges and pre-service training was provided to

2,059 persons at the Colleges of Education. The National

Institute of Education, which is responsible for the

establishment of a base for the implementation of the

proposed educational reforms, has commenced initial work

on curriculum development, training education officers,

development of school based techniques etc. A survey has

been earned out on international schools, with a view to

formulating policy guidelines and making recommendations

for the regulation of the international school system. Some

of the recommendations made were - registration of

international schools with the Ministry of Education to be

made mandatory, diversification of syllabi and teaching

methodologies, development of core curricula with an

appropriate national content, development of guidelines and

stipulation of norms in respect of infrastructure facilities and

human resources and developing an effective supervising

system. ;

Higher Education

There were 12 national universities and 6 postgraduate institutions in the country by end 1997. Having recognised the need to develop skills based education, computer education branches were opened at the Universities of Colombo, Sri Jayawardenapura and Peradeniya. New degree courses in law policies, pharmacology, surveying and nursing were commissioned at the Universities of Colombo, Sri Jayawardenapura, Sabaragamuwa and the Open University. Professional guidance units were established in four universities with a view to providing information on employment opportunities available in the state sector as well as in the private sector. Projects were in progress to provide educational equipment and construct new building complexes at the Universities of Peradeniya and Sri Jayawardenapura at a cost of Rs. 1,925 million with Japanese aid. In addition several large construction projects have been undertaken to expand and upgrade the building complexes for the medical and engineering faculties at Peradeniya and Ruhuna during the year under review.

New admissions to the universities expanded by 1,124

to 9,787 (about 14 per cent of students who qualified for

university education) in 1997, increasing the total enrolment

to 34,139. This is equivalent to about 1 per cent of the

relevant age group of the population. The expansion was

mainly in the fields of .arts, commerce and management

studies. The total academic strength in the universities also

expanded by 4 per cent. The share of the admissions on the

basis of achievements (extra curricular activities) increased.

69

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

The total number of students receiving Mahapola scholarship

and bursaries expanded by about 2,000 to 36,000 by end

1997.

The Open University conducted 34 courses at diploma,

degree and post-graduate levels under three faculties namely

engineering technology, humanities and social sciences and

natural sciences. By end 1997, there were 32 Technical

Institutions in the country with a total student enrollment of

15,397. During the year under review new admissions to the

Technical Colleges expanded by 2,000 to 12,238.

Reforms of university education is needed to be

implemented early, considering the mismatch between formal

educational achievements and'the skills required in the labour

market. According to the Central Bank Consumer Finances

and Socio Economic Survey 1996/97, there are about 11,740

unemployed graduates in the country. As there are a large

number of students who are debarred from entering the

universities, promotion of the expansion of private sector

higher educational institutions, including professional

education, should be a part of the educational reforms.

5.4 Communication Services

Postal Services

In order to address the present structural and

institutional rigidities of the postal service, a comprehensive

restructuring programme has been proposed with the

assistance of the World Bank and the Universal Postal Union

(UPU). The restructuring programme proposes to transform

the present Postal Department into a Postal Corporation. The

proposed Postal Corporation is to be provided with greater

autonomy for enhancing management efficiency in the

service. The proposed reforms also intend to improve

commercial viability, develop innovative postal products, use

modern technology and promote private sector participation

in certain areas of the service. With a view to regularising

the free postal service offered to the Government and

reducing the operational cost of the Postal Department,

maximum limits were imposed on the volume of free postal

services. The postal services provided during week ends and

public holidays were also suspended with a view to reducing

operational costs.

With the opening of 2 new main post offices, 16 agency

post offices and 45 rural agency post offices, the postal

network increased to 4,302 in 1997. Consequently, the area

served by a post-office declined further to 15.3 sq. kms. by

end 1997. The Express Mail Service (EMS) was expanded

to cover 57 countries by end 1997 and an EMS pick up

service was also introduced during the year. Another 50 main

post-offices were provided with fax machines, thereby

increasing the total number of post offices with fax facilities

to 177. The postal delivery service in the City of Colombo,

which has so far been performed by the Central Mail

Exchange, was decentralised. Independent letter sorting and

delivery services were introduced in the Borella, Kotahena,

Slave Island and Wellawatte postal divisions. In order to

meet the increasing demand for postal facilities, the Rural

Agency Post Office System was introduced with the

assistance of 'Sanasa' as a pilot project in 1996, and 17 such

Post Offices were established during 1996. As at end 1997,

there were 62 Rural Agency Post Offices in the country.

Postal services in the Jaffna Peninsula were also expanded

substantially during 1997. At present, 30 main post offices

and 124 sub-post offices are operating in the Jaffna area.

The total number of inland mail articles handled by the

Department of Posts dropped by 5 per cent in 1997 over the

previous year. This was largely due to the restriction

imposed on non-paid postal services provided to the-

Government in 1997. Free postal services provided to the

Government dropped considerably to 56 million mail articles

in 1997 from 128 million in 1996. Consequently, the average

number of letters per person dropped from 27 to 24 between

the two years. However, the paid postal services, at 390

million articles, rose by 14 per cent during the year. The

overall expansion in the postal service in the foreseeable

future appears to be gloomy unless it is restructured to meet

the demands of modern society in the context of a rapid

expansion in the speedier alternative modes of

communication such as telephones, IDD facilities, telefax, e-

mail and private courier services. Foreign mail handling also

dropped marginally during the year.

The total revenue of the Postal Department rose by 6

per cent to Rs.l,409 million, mainly due to the upward

revision of the postal charges in 1997. Meanwhile, the total

operational expenditure of the Postal Department at Rs.l,664

million; showed a marginal decrease. Accordingly, the

operational loss of the Postal Department dropped from

. Rs.344 million in 1996 to Rs.255 million in 1997.

Telecommunication

The telecommunication sector continued to expand

during 1997 with increased participation by the private sector

and a higher level of performance of Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd.

(SLTL). The linking of SLTL with the Nippon Telegraph

and Telephone Corporation (NTT) of Japan in 1997 will

pave the way for attracting more investment, introducing

modern technology, infusing management capabilities and

enhancing the technical and professional skills of the staff

of SLTL. The number of new telephone connections given

during 1997, at 72,453, was the largest given during a single

70

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

year. This represents about 23 per cent of the total existing

land telephone lines in the country. About 62 per cent of

the existing telephone lines were given during the last 5

years. At the same time, with an increasing number of new

connections, the growth of the waiting list has decelerated

during the past few years. The share of the private sector

in the telecommunication market is also growing rapidly and

the telecommunication sector appears to be a promising

sector for faster growth in the future.

â€¢ Along with the sale of 35 per cent of the shareholding

of SLTL to NTT, the management of the restructured

company was also taken over by the NTT in accordance

with the agreement. The NTT management team has

formulated a business plan for 1997 and 1998 and a

medium-term plan that extends to the year 2000, in order

to address critical issues in the sector and to accelerate

development programmes. As a result, a significant

improvement in the overall performance of the SLTL was

witnessed during 1997. The switching capacity of exchanges

increased significantly by 41 per cent to 436,550, while the

total number of international circuits increased by 16 per cent

to 1,717. Meanwhile, the number of direct working telephone

lines increased by 24 per cent to 315241. Of the total direct

lines, 186,674 or 59 per cent were in the Colombo

metropolitan area. However, the proportion of

telecommunication facilities available outside the Colombo .

metropolitan area increased from 35 per cent in 1996 to 41

per cent in 1997. In the meantime, the number of applicants

on the waiting list increased by 5 per cent to 284,876, which,

represents 47 per cent of the expressed demand. The

improved from 72 in 1996 to 58 in. 1997. The medium-term

target is to have a telephone density of 20 persons per

telephone by the year 2001.

Most of the major projects in the second

telecommunication programme funded with assistance

obtained from international aid agencies such as the World

Bank/IDA, ADB and OECF were completed during 1997.

These projects have contributed towards the increase in

capacity and improvement in the transmission system,

resulting in a considerable improvement in the quality and

reliability of the service. The 150,000 Line

Telecommunication Development Project, which is being

implemented by Sri Lanka Telecom Services Ltd. (SLTS),

a subsidiary of SLTL, was also in progress during 1997. This

project is being implemented to add about 200,000 exchange

lines to cover townships and rural areas in almost all the

provinces. This project commenced in 1996 and by the end

of 1997, about 120,000 exchange lines had been added to

the network. A total of 69 exchanges with a capacity of

67,344 exchange lines were commissioned during 1997.

. Chart S.2 telephone Density in Selected Countries â€¢ 1997

A number of value added services have also been provided by SLTL to its subscribers. These include telephone hunting facilities, abbreviated dialling, absentee service, call waiting, call forwarding, conference calls and pre-assigned number facilities. In addition, SLTL had installed 1,111 units of public pay phones, provided Internet and e-mail services to 3,683 subscribers and packet switching services to 12 customers by end 1997. On account of increasing demand for facsimile, Internet and e-mail services, the demand for telex services has been declining.

The 3rd Telecom Development Programme has been

reviewed under the new management and a medium-term

development programme has been drawn up for providing

400,000 telephone lines during 1998 - 2000. According to

the proposed investment programme, SLTL expects to invest

Rs.23,000 million in 1998, Rs.16,800 million in 1999 and

Rs.6,600 million in 2000. Funds will be generated from

foreign sources, suppliers' credits and SLTL's own funds.

Once these development projects are completed. SLTL will

be able 'to provide telephone facilities on demand. With

respect to SLTL projects, procedural delays in the

procurement process, lack of co-ordination with other utility

agencies such as the RDA and problems relating to land

acquisition for building purposes remain impediments to

speedier execution of projects.

Telecommunication facilities provided by the private

sector further expanded during 1997. There were 24 licensed

private sector companies providing various

telecommunication services at end 1997 against 22 in 1996.

At end 1997, there were 4 cellular telephone operators,

providing services to 114,888 subscribers. The cellular

subscriber network increased by 62 per cent during 1997.

The total number of pay phone booths increased by 19 per

cent to 2,571. Radio paging services were being provided by

5 companies to 10,829 subscribers in 1997. The subscriber

network of data communication services, which includes e-

mail and Internet services, increased more than twofold to

9,045 during 1997. Two companies commenced- providing

Wireless Local Loop (WILL) telephone services in 1996. At

end 1997, there were 26,381 subscribers to this service.

When the WILL telephone connections are also taken into

account, the telephone density stands at one telephone for

54 persons. The total cumulative private investment in the

telecommunication sector amounted to Rs.15,270 million by

end 1997, of which Rs.6,844 million was made during 1997.

The total number of employment opportunities in this sector,

excluding those in SLTL, was 1,627.

5.5 Energy

The energy sector showed a strong recovery in 1997

from the severe power crisis experienced in 1996. The

continuity and reliability of the power supply was ensured

by expanding the thermal power generating capacity of the

national grid by 177 MW. Consequently, total power

generation grew by 13 per cent compared with a decline of

5 per cent in the previous year, satisfying the growing

demand. As in the previous year, hydro electric power

generation was adversely affected by dry weather conditions

that prevailed during the first half of 1997 but a substantial

improvement occurred during the latter part of the year. The

shortfall in hydro power generation was off-set through

thermal power generation. The expansion of the thermal

power generating capacity in the national grid together with

short-term crisis management measures adopted since 1996

such as hiring of diesel plants from the private sector, power

purchases and encouragement of private sector self-generation

72

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

of power, ensured the continuity of power supply.

Nevertheless, in order to cover the substantial increase in the

cost of thermal power generation (fuel cost, power purchase

expenses and generator hiring charges) the electricity tariff

was raised by 11 per cent with effect from September 1997,

Meanwhile, the demand for two major petroleum products,

namely, auto diesel and furnace oil, continued to expand on

account of increased thermal power generation and enhanced

transport and industrial activities. The increased reliance on

imported energy sources raised the cost of the country's oil

bill substantially. However, the marginal decline in the

international prices of crude oil and duty waivers offered in

respect of imports of crude oil improved the financial

position of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in 1997.

During the year under review, appreciable efforts were

made to improve the reliability of the power system. The

urgent actions taken to expand the capacity of the national

grid in 1997 and the anticipated expansion by 51 MW. in

1998, would help to avert a power crisis situation in the

short run. However, a repetition of a crisis situation as

experienced in 1996 would have a severe adverse impact on

a growing economy such as Sri Lanka. Hence, the reliance

on hydro power should be further reduced and continuity of

the power supply should be improved in the medium and

long-term by implementing a well designed generation plan

based on economic needs. Procedural and implementation

delays should be minimised and projects should be

implemented on a very strict time schedule. It is essential

to avoid short-term measures which are costly, such as hiring

power generation, as it would impose heavy burdens on

consumers by way of high electricity tariffs. Meanwhile, the

electricity pricing system should be further rationalised by

removing cross subsidies in order to improve the

competitiveness of the export sector. Despite heavy

investments in improvement in the transmission and

distribution network, serious attention should be paid to the

high level of distribution losses. As the reliance on thermal

power is gradually on the increase and considering its

possible impact on energy prices and on the balance of

payments, implementation of an effective energy conservation

programme is essential..

Electricity

In 1997, the total installed capacity of electricity

generation including electricity hired from the private sector,

expanded by 11 per cent to 1,607 MW. from 1,453 MW.

in 1996. This implied a reduction in dependence on hydro

power from 81 per cent in 1996 to 71 per cent in 1997

reducing the vulnerability of the power system to weather

factors. The most welcome development and a long felt neeti

was the expansion in the national grid by 178 MW. to 1,587

MW. by adding three thermal power plants, namely, the

Kelanitissa gas turbine project of 115 MW., the

Sapugaskanda Power Station Project (extension) of 40 MW,

at a total cost of Rs.5.5 billion and the first private sector

Build, Operate and Own (BOO) power project of 22.5 MW.

constructed by Lakdhanavt Private Ltd. in December 1997

at a cost of Rs.l,000 million. These 3 power plants increased

the annual power generation potential by 1,280 GWh. to

6,696 GWh. by end 1997. In addition, as a result of the

generous incentive scheme offered to the private sector to

import generators, a total of 248 BOI and non-BOI

companies had installed a capacity of 108 MVA by end of

1997. Meanwhile, hired private power which increased to,

150 MW. by end July 1997 to meet the shortage of hydro

power, was confined to 20 MW. by end of the year with

improved water levels in 'reservoirs.

The electricity generated from all sources (CEB, private

sector, hired power and self generation) in 1997 rose by 13

per cent to 5,126 GWh. compared to a decline of 5 per cent

in the previous year. Hydro power generation by the CEB,

which dropped by 12 per cent in the first half of the year,

improved substantially in the second half of the year due to

a favourable North-East Monsoon. Consequently, hydro

power generation during 1997 rose by 6 per cent compared

with a decline of 28 per cent in 1996. In order to meet

the shortfall in hydro power and the rising demand, there

was a substantial expansion in thermal power generation.

Thermal power generation, including private power and self-

generation, increased by 31 per cent to 1,678 GWh. during

1997. Self-generation by private sector entities stood at 217

GWh. recording an increase of 43 per cent compared with

the previous year, reflecting an improvement in captive

generating capacity. Consequently, in terms of generated

power, the reliance on thermal power improved to 33 per

cent in 1997 compared with 28 per cent in 1996. The

increased thermal power generation and-the urgent need to

expand the generating capacity had a significant impact on

the financial operations of the CEB in 1997. According to

the CEB, total expenditure on thermal power generation,

including payments for hiring charges, self generation and

power purchases, was in the region of Rs.7,235 million.

In the wake of high cost thermal power generation,

electricity tariffs were revised with effect from 1 September

1997, to raise the rate of return of the CEB. The average

tariff of electricity was increased to Rs.4.52 per unit from

Rs.4.05 or by 11 per cent. The domestic average tariff

increased by 14.6 per cent. For the domestic sector, the CEB

has introduced a minimum charge of Rs.25 in order to

safeguard the low income consumers from the large tariff

increases which will occur if normal tariff is applied. The

average tariff for the industrial sector rose at a relatively

lower rate of 9 per cent compared to other categories,

reducing the cross subsidy provided to the domestic sector.

showed an increase of 14 per cent. Even when adjusted for

energy losses due to power cuts in the previous year,

demand for power grew by 10 per cent reflecting a growing

demand resulting from expanding economic activities and

domestic needs. Total power consumed by the domestic

74

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

sector rose by 16 per cent partly reflecting an increase in

the consumer network from 1.56 to 1.71 million households.

The use of electricity by the industrial and commercial

sectors also increased by 9 and 16 per cent, respectively.

Sales to Lanka Electric Company (LECO) also increased by

21 per cent during 1997.

The investment expenditure on generation, transmission

and distribution projects was in the region of Rs.7,756

million. Of this, Rs.3.840 million or 49 per cent was spent

on power generation projects. Foreign funded power

generation projects which showed progress during the year

were the Sapugaskanda Power System Expansion Project

(Rs.509 million), the West Coast Coal Project (Rs. 151

million), the Kukule Hydro Power Project (Rs.280 million).

Samanalawewa (Rs.636 million) and the Sapugaskanda KFW

Second Extension Project (Rs.413 million). The balance

Rs.3.916 million was spent on transmission and distribution

projects with the aim of upgrading and expanding MV and

LV distribution lines, reducing system losses and improving

voltage levels and reliability. The main transmission and

distribution projects undertaken during the year were the

Transmission and Grid Substation Development Project

(Rs.591 million), the Transmission System Augmentation and

Development Project (Rs.220 million) funded by the OECF,

the Augmentation of Grid Substation Project funded by

KFW, the Power System Expansion Project (Rs.516) funded

by the ADB and the Second Power Distribution and

Transmission Project (Rs.2.256 million) funded by the IDA.

In addition, a sum of Rs.417 million was spent under the

Rural Electrification Scheme funded by the ADB. with a

view to improving and expanding the distribution network

in rural areas. Once this project is completed, it will provide

electricity to about 110,000 additional consumers by the year

In order to improve the power generation capacity and system reliability in the medium and long-term a number of thermal and hydro power projects are in the pipeline. Construction work on the 51 MW. KHD power project at a cost of US dollars 62 million was in progress during 1997. The project is expected to be completed in mid 1998. The Sapugaskanda Power Station Expansion Project Extension 2 (40 MW) funded by the KFW and the CEB at a cost of Rs.3,321 million, commenced in 1997 and the scheduled completion year is 1999. Initial site works and tender procedures have been in progress on the 60 MW. Kukule Ganga Hydro Power Project, estimated to cost Rs.l2,635 million and to be funded by the OECF and the CEB. Initial work on a combined cycle gas turbine plant (150 MW.) funded by the OECF at Kelanitissa at a cost of Rs.8,000 million commenced in 1997 and is scheduled to be completed in the year 2000. With respect to private sector power projects, proposals were called for a 150 MW. combined cycle power project and two 20 MW. diesel power plants at Matara, Matugama and Anuradhapura. Negotiations have been in progress to build a 60 MW. Barge Mounted Plant at Kotugoda.

Energy conservation through the sale of energy saving compact fluorescent lamps has been continued during the year under review. A programme to sell 220,000 lamps to achieve.a saving of 3.75 GWh. was introduced in the Western Province. A similar scheme was introduced for the public sector by the Energy Conservation Fund. In addition, energy audits, surveys and publicity programmes were also carried out.

Petroleum Products

The expenditure on petroleum imports grew by 5 per

cent to US dollars 503 million, accounting for 10 per cent

of the total import bill. This was due to an increase in the

volume of petroleum products to meet the additional

requirements for thermal power generation and enhanced

transport demand. The international price of crude oil, which

rose steeply during the first quarter, recorded a downward

trend during the third and fourth quarters of the year.

Consequently, there was a marginal decrease in the average

international price of crude oil in 1997 compared with an

increase of 15 per cent in the previous year. The volume of

crude oil imports dropped by 11 per cent to 1.8 million

metric tons during 1997 due to the closure of the oil refinery

for routine maintenance purposes from January to February

1997. In order to meet the shortfall in supply, the import

of refined products increased to 1.1 million metric tons by

49 per cent. The expenditure on imports of liquefied

petroleum gas (LPG) rose due to both a higher volume of

imports and increased international prices.

Domestic prices of petroleum products remained

unchanged in 1997. The cross subsidies on kerosene, auto

diesel and fuel oil were also continued. At the end of the

year, auto diesel and kerosene were being sold at 7 per cent

and 21 per cent, respectively, below cost. Furnace oil was

heavily subsidised by selling it at 29 per cent below the unit

cost of production. A 10 per cent waiver on Customs duty

was effective throughout the year, the import duty being

lowered from 35 per cent to 25 per cent. This, with a

marginal decline in international prices and the strict,

overhead cost control measures adopted, enabled the financial

position of the CPC to reach a break-even level in 1997,

compared with a loss of Rs.3.000 million in 1996.

The domestic consumption of petroleum products rose

by 10 per cent in 1997. The demand for auto diesel further

expanded by 24 per cent, following a 32 per cent increase

in the previous year, reflecting the additional needs related

to enhanced thermal power generation and the growing

transport needs of the economy. Meanwhile, the demand for

furnace oil grew by 10 per cent, partly due to expansion in

industrial sector activities. The sale of kerosene remained

around the same level as in 1996 as a substitution is taking

place towards electricity. The demand for petrol declined by

2 per cent indicating a switch from petrol to diesel and gas

driven vehicles due to the relative price advantage,

Several projects were undertaken, to improve and expand

the distribution network for petroleum products. The contract

for rehabilitation of storage tanks at the Orugodawatta and

Kolonnawa installations and the construction of a new

distribution terminal at Sapugaskanda was awarded in 1997.

The project is to be funded by an ADB- loan of US dollars

24 million and the local component of Rs.l,000 million by

a NDB loan. The project is to be completed by end 1999.

Another project to improve regional storage facilities by

constructing 13 storage tanks was in progress during the

year. The total cost of this project has been estimated at

Rs.62 million. The development of an aviation re-fueling

facility at Katunayake, reconstruction of retail outlets,

revamping of high vacuum and bitumen blowing plant and

the sulpher recover plant were undertaken during the year.

In the wake of the power crisis in 1996, measures were

taken to equip 80 per cent of retail outlets with their own

generators, assuring continuity of service. Meanwhile,

measures were taken to rehabilitate storing, marketing and

distribution facilities for petroleum products in the Northern

Province which had been destroyed during the civil war. Five

76

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997.

storage tanks of 100,000 litre capacity were installed at

Kankasanthurai (KKS) for storing kerosene and diesel. The

distribution system from the KKS harbour to the KKS tank

farm has been rehabilitated. Approximately 40 retail outlets

in Jaffna have been rehabilitated and reactivated and this has

effectively resulted in a reduction of the cost of.diesel and

kerosene in that area.

5.6 Transportation

Transport Network

The national transport network expanded slightly in

1997, as a result of enhanced involvement by the private

sector. However, there are many areas, particularly roads and

passenger transportation, where qualitative improvements are

needed. The country has nearly 100,000 kms. of roads of

which 11,147 kms. have been categorized as A and B class

roads which are under the Road Development Authority

(RDA). There were no additions to the A and B class roads

in 1997. C and D Class roads of nearly 15.000 kms. are

being maintained by the Provincial Councils. The remaining

road network is under local governments and other public

and private institutions such as the Mahaweli Authority,

Irrigation .Department, Forest Department, Wildlife

Department and plantation companies.

The total vehicle stock of the country at end 1997 stood

at 1,407,381, including motor cycles, and grew by 6 per

cent. The vehicle stock, without motor cycles, was 731,747

at end 1997. The 11 Regional Transport Companies

(formerly Peoplised Bus Companies) owned 8,007 buses, but

the average number of buses operated per day was 4,487.

There were approximately 12,800 private buses engaged in

passenger transportation in 1997. The rolling stock position

of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) remained almost unchanged

during 1997. It owned 57 locomotives, 26 power sets, 1,312

carriages and 2,575 wagons to operate a rail track network

of 1,463 kilometers. SLR's share in goods transportation has

been declining over the years and as a result, private truckers

handled about 95 per cent of the goods transportation by

land. There are about 55,550 trucks mainly engaged in goods

transportation.

The major ports of the country, namely, Colombo,

Galle, Trincomalee and Kankasanturai, are managed by the

Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Port of Colombo, which

handles more than 90 per cent of the cargo, has the capacity

to handle 1.6 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Container

Units (TEUs) per annum in addition to the capacity to handle

bulk and liquid cargo.

With respect to air transportation, there are 12 domestic

airports, in addition to the Bandaranaike International Airport

at Katunayake. Air Lanka, the national carrier, owns a fleet of 9 aircrafts and operates scheduled passenger services to 28 destinations in twenty countries.

During 1997, several important steps were taken to

expand and improve transport infrastructure, particularly with

regard to passenger transportation. The formation of Regional

Transport Companies (RTC) was completed during the year

with the intention of improving the efficiency of public bus

transport services. Import tariffs on public transport vehicles

were completely removed with the 1998 Budget as an

incentive for investment in the transport sector. At the same

time, funds were allocated to import 1,500 bus engines for

the RTCs to replace non-operational buses. In addition,

several financial assistance programmes have been introduced

for investors in the transport sector through commercial

banks and other financial institutions.

Road Development

The RDA is the apex institution responsible for the development and maintenance of the national highway network which comprises all A and B class roads to the extent of 11,147 kilometers. The RDA also maintained 4,422 bridges during the year. Total expenditure of the RDA on road construction/rehabilitation in 1997 was Rs.5.730 million, which represents a sharp increase of 72 per cent over the expenditure of the previous year. However, national road maintenance expenditure increased only by 13 per cent, to Rs.266 million, during the year. Funds allocated for road maintenance are inadequate. With the present annual allocation, only about one tenth of the national road network can be maintained. Provincial Councils, (except the North-East Provincial Council) have reported that there are approximately 15,000 kilometers of roads under their purview. Total expenditure on roads incurred by the Provincial Councils (PCs) decreased by 7 per cent to Rs. 724 million in 1997. The Ministry of Transport and Highways allocated Rs. 800 million to assist PCs in road development activities.

Sri Lanka has a road coverage of approximately 1,550 kms. per 1,000 sq. kms. of area or road density of 54 kms. per 10,000 persons, which is considered to be remarkable when compared to Asian standards. However, periodic and routine maintenance of roads has not been in keeping with the expansion of economic activities and the increasing vehicle fleet. Inadequate allocation of funds has been the major impediment to satisfactory maintenance. As a result, road conditions, particularly those of provincial and local roads, have deteriorated considerably over the years, thereby, increasing transport costs. It has been observed that available resources have not been properly utilised to derive the maximum benefit due to poor co-ordination and weak monitoring of road maintenance by various institutions, in particular, at provincial and local levels.

77

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

The road rehabilitation programme of the RDA

continued during 1997 with foreign assistance. The World

Bank's Third Road Rehabilitation Project, designed to

rehabilitate 397 kms. of roads and reconstruct 19 bridges in

the Southern, Western and North Western Provinces, was in

progress in 1997. Under this project, rehabilitation work on

221 kilometers of roads was undertaken at a cost of Rs.1,712

million during the year. Reconstruction of 5 bridges in the

Gampaha District and 10 bridges in the Matara and

Hambantota Districts at a cost of Rs.l82 million was also

in progress. Under the ADB - Third Road Rehabilitation

Project. 184 kms. of roads will be rehabilitated at a cost of

Rs.l,966 million. This project includes the rehabilitation of

103 kms. of the Katunayake - Puttalam road at a cost of

Rs.l.084 million. The construction work of the OECF funded

Baseline Road Reconstruction Project - Phase I, which

commenced in 1997, will be completed by end 1998. The

project includes construction of a dual 3 lane road from the

Kelanitissa roundabout to the High Level Road at Kirulapone

with a fly-over across the railway line at Dematagoda and

a pedestrian sub-way at the Borella junction. Contracts are

to be awarded shortly for the construction of the OECF

funded Sri Lanka-Japan Friendship Bridge - Phase II to

provide two additional lanes. With assistance from the

Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, rehabilitation/

reconstruction of 28 bridges at a cost of Rs.600 million is

in progress. The detailed engineering design work for

rehabilitation of the Ratnapura - Beragala - Badulla road with

Korean assistance has been completed and construction work

is due to commence in 1998.

Under the OECF assisted periodic road maintenance programme, extensive sand sealing and surface dressing of 1,760 kms. was completed at end 1997 at a cost of Rs.875 million. The construction of Stage 1 of the Kandy sub-way was completed in 1997 and construction work of Stage II is in progress. A fly-over across the main railway line at Ragama is also in progress and the estimated cost of this project is Rs.200 million. The Southern Highway Project has been referred to the ADB to carry out a feasibility study with the objective of getting ADB assistance for construction of the highway. . In respect of the Colombo - Katunayake expressway, the feasibility study and the environmental impact assessment have been completed. This project is intended to be carried out as a BOO/BOT Project.

Passenger Transport

Although there was no noticeable progress in the

passenger transport sector during 1997, a strong commitment

to improve the scale of operations of the passenger

transportation through restructuring and capacity expansion

was observed during the year. In terms of the National

Transport Commission (Amendment) Act No.30 of 1996, the

formation of Regional Transport Companies (cluster

companies) was completed during 1997. Accordingly, the 93

Peoplised Bus Companies were clustered into 11 RTCs.

This enabled the RTCs to operate a well integrated service

network in the respective regions and to share resources in

management, training and maintenance while benefiting from

the economies of scale. It is too early to conduct a complete

evaluation of the new system as the formation of RTCs

continued until the latter part of the year. The above Act

also stipulates that the private sector bus operators should

form themselves into companies, with each company to own

at least 50 buses within 5 years from the date of Gazette

notification of this requirement. The Gazette notification will

be issued in due course. However, as a prerequisite, non-

licensing of low-roofed buses and low carriage capacity

buses has already been adopted.

Private investors have responded favourably to the 20

per cent fare increase effected from July 1996. and the.

accompanying incentives given by way of tariff concessions,

credit and leasing facilities. However, the sluggish

performances of the SLR continued during 1997, owing to

a chronic shortage of investment in rolling stock, track

maintenance and traffic control.

Bus Transport

The scale of operations of the Peoplised Bus

Companies/RTCs declined during 1997, mainly owing to a

drop in the active bus fleet for passenger conveyance. The

average number of buses operated per day in 1997 dropped

to 4,487 from 4,716 in 1996. A total of 460 new buses was

added to their fleet by RTCs during 1997 compared to 272

new buses during 1996. Some non-operating buses were

disposed of to the private sector during the year. To keep

the time tables in order and provide a reasonably satisfactory

bus service to the public, the RTCs require an active bus

fleet of 6,275 ,

The operated kilometerage of RTCs further dropped by

3.6 per cent to 335 million kilometers in 1997. Reflecting the same trend, the passenger kilometerage also dropped by

6.7 per cent to 18,902 million kilometers in 1997 against a 4.5 per cent increase in 1996. The total revenue of RTCs was Rs.4,897 million, of which Rs.4,585 was from passenger fares. Operating expenditure increased by 8 per cent to Rs.6,471 million due to an increased wage bill and maintenance expenditure. As in the previous year, the RTCs received Rs.360 million from the Government as subsidies for operation of bus services in non-remunerative roads and for issue of season tickets to school children at subsidised rates. Accordingly, the operating loss of RTCs expanded by 44 per cent to Rs.l,214 million in 1997.

In addition to the semi-luxury bus service which was

introduced in 1996, a single rate luxury bus service was

introduced in the latter part of 1997, in the suburbs of

Colombo with'a view to curtailing the traffic congestion in

Colombo through attracting personal vehicle users to this bus

service. The semi-luxury bus service, was also further

expanded during 1997 and at the end of the year, there were

230 buses providing this service. These bus services helped

to ease the pressure on passenger transport, particularly

during peak hours.

Private sector participation in passenger transportation

improved slightly in 1997. The total number of permits

issued to private bus operators by all Provincial Councils

(except the North-East) and the National Transport Council

(NTC), increased by 19 per cent to 12,776 in 1997. Of the

total permits issued, 5,422 permits had been issued by the

Western Provincial Council. The seating capacity of private

buses in provincial services also increased significantly by

24 per cent to 337,028 in 1997. Meanwhile, the number of

bus owners in the provinces declined to 8,018 in 1997 from

8^27 in 1996, indicating a gradual shifting of ownership

from single owners to fleet owners. This is a welcome

development because it reduces the overhead cost of bus

operations and eases monitoring by the authorities.

The NTC continued to. implement several programmes

during 1997 with a view to strengthening the passenger

transportation service of the country. Based on the

recommendations made by the Committee on Reorganisation

of Peoplised Bus Companies and Private Bus Operators, the

formation of RTCs was carried out by the NTC during 1997.

In order to improve the quality of service, a comprehensive

project for the training of private bus crews has been

undertaken by the NTC in collaboration with the Provincial

Transport Authorities and assistance from the World Bank.

A total of 2,876 drivers and conductors have been trained

during 1997. The NTC also implemented a programme under

which un-remunerative rural bus routes were offered to

private bus operators on a competitive tender basis. Under

this programme, five rural routes have been offered during

1997 and 19 other routes have been identified for the calling

of tenders. lit addition, the NTC disbursed Rs.200 million

to RTCs in respect of providing bus services in un-economic

rural routes. A programme has also been introduced to

provide free transport facilities for disabled aimed service

personnel and police personnel.

Rail Transport

The performance of SLR continued to be unsatisfactory

in 1997. The operated kilometerage remained unchanged at

7.7 million kilometers in 1997 while the passenger

kilometerage increased by 3.1 per cent to 3,342 million

79

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

kilometers, against a 2 per cent decrease in 1996. Freight

transportation by SLR dropped significantly by 14 per cent

in 1997, further losing its market share. .

Several decades ago the SLR played a dominant role in passenger and freight transportation, but today it has become less important due to competition from other modes of transportation and various inefficiencies built up within its operations. There is a critical need to rehabilitate and restructure the entire SLR to make it a commercially viable enterprise. Additional investment is needed for upgrading and modernising the outdated railway infrastructure which causes frequent derailment and enforcement of number of speed limits. The depleting rolling stock position restricts operations and causes cancellation of scheduled services. The obsolete centralised traffic control system and communication system also impede the day to day operations of SLR.

Despite these difficulties, the SLR took several steps to expand its operations with the objective of providing extra services to commuters. An additional night mail train, Colombo/Badulla/Colombo, was introduced in 1997. A third rail track from Maradana to Ragama was opened for traffic in the latter part of. 1997. Seven new railway substations were also opened during the year. Additional carriages were coupled to long distance commuter trains while some suburban services were extended to ease congestion. Meanwhile, broad gauging of the Kelani Valley line upto Avissawella was completed during the year.

The rolling stock position of the SLR improved slightly during 1997, owing to progress on several projects implemented by the SLR. Under the OECF funded Railway Rehabilitation Project 6 locomotives were released for service while under the re-engining programme 3 locomotives were released. In addition, 4 locomotives of the M8 class were purchased under an Indian line of credit and added to the fleet. The SLR also undertook several programmes to improve the railway infrastructure. Two railway bridges at Panadura and Kalutara were repaired and opened for traffic, while the construction of 3 new bridges was initiated during the year. Under the OECF funded Rail Track Rehabilitation Project, 75 per cent of track rehabilitation between the sections Galle/Kandy and Ragama/Negombo has been completed. The construction of a duplicate track from Panadura to Kalutara and from Polgahawela to Rambukkana has also been initiated.

The revenue of the SLR increased by 9.8 per cent in 1997, mainly due to the 20 per cent passenger fare increase effected from March 1996 and due to a marginal increase in the passenger kilometerage. Meanwhile, current expenditure dropped by 5 per cent to 1,742 million, mainly due to a 17 per cent drop in the maintenance expenditure to Rs.l,079 million. Consequently, the operating loss of SLR dropped by 20 per cent to Rs.712 million in 1997. The capital expenditure of SLR dropped by 10 per cent to

Rs.4,187 million in 1997.

Port Services

The demand for port services continued to grow during

1997 and surpassed the present capacity of container

handling of the Port of Colombo. At current productivity

levels, the Port of Colombo has the capacity to handle 1.6

million TEUs per annum whereas it handled 1.7 million

TEUs in 1997. Container throughput recorded a 24 per cent

growth when compared to a 29 per cent growth recorded in

1996. Transshipment container handling, which accounts for

about 75 per cent of the total container handling, further rose

by 26 per cent after a sharp 40 per cent growth recorded in

1996. The number of ships that called at the Port of

Colombo increased by 5 per cent to 3,627, while the total

volume of cargo handling increased by 18 per cent to 27

million metric tons in 1997. Meanwhile, cargo handling at

the ports of Galle and Trincomalee dropped by 23 per cent

and 4 per cent, respectively, during 1997.

The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) encountered

severe difficulties during the year due to capacity limitations

of the Port of Colombo. The turnaround time of cargo

vessels calling at the Port of Colombo increased significantly

as the Port was operating at its full capacity in 1997. The

average waiting time of main liners, feeders and conventional

vessels increased from 6.4, 14.2 and 24.9 hours, respectively,

in 1996 to 6.9, 24.6 and 28.5 hours, respectively, in 1997,

while the average berth stay of these categories of vessels

increased from 15.6, 29.8 and 114.1 hours, respectively, to

27.0, 47:4 and 120.1 hours, respectively. Attempts were

made to ease these difficulties by improving the productivity

of the Port. Gross gantry moves per hour increased from 18

in 1996 to 20 in 1997. Net gantry moves per hour increased

from 23 in 1996 to 26 in 1997. In addition, to meet the

steadily growing demand for port services, several short-term

projects were also initiated during 1997. The development

of the North pier to handle 100,000 TEUs per annum with

general cargo was initiated with assistance from the Overseas

Economic Corporation Fund (OECF). The total cost of this

project has been estimated at US dollars 15 million. Work

is also in progress to add 3 Container Cranes and 6 Transfer.

Cranes to the Jaye Container Terminal (JCT) at a cost of

US dollars 40 million, funded by the OECF. This would

facilitate stacking empty containers to a height of 8

containers from the present 5 containers, thereby increasing

the yard capacity by 300,000 TEUs per annum. Programmes

were also underway to develop the Galle and Trincomalee

jetties to ease the pressure on handling general cargo in the

Port of Colombo.

Sri Lanka has high potential for emerging as. the

capacity is expanded sufficiently and port productivity and

efficiency are increased to competitive levels. Past

performances of the Port of Colombo indicate that there is

a direct relationship between capacity expansion and growth

of demand for port services. In an environment where

neighbouring ports in the region are expanding rapidly and

compete to attract demand for shipping services emerging in

the region, Sri Lanka has to take firm action to expedite the

execution of planned port expansion projects without any

further delays. In view of this, the Government has

formulated several plans to expand the port services of the

country. The recently declared National Ports and Shipping

Policy of Sri Lanka states that the policy envisages the

emergence of Sri Lanka as the premier shipping centre in

South Asia with Colombo operating as a hub port,

complemented by modernised ports at Galle, Kankasanturai

and Trincomalee and new ports at Oluvil and Hambantota.

The implementation of several proposals made for the

expansion of port infrastructure facilities to develop the

Colombo Port as the hub port in the region is already under

serious consideration. The development of the Queen

Elizabeth Quay (QEQ) under a BOO/BOT basis to enhance

the container handling capacity to one million TEUs per

annum, at an estimated cost of US dollars 200 million, is to commence shortly. Proposals for the development of a new South Port of Colombo and new North Port of Colombo are very large projects involving the construction of breakwaters etc. to meet the growing demand for port services, particularly for transshipment, envisaged during the next decade. The container throughput at the Port of Colombo has been forecast at 2.3 - 3.6 million TEUs in the year 2005 and at about 3.8 - 6.7 million TEUs in the year

2015. In this context, planned port expansion projects have to begin without further delay to cater to this demand and harness the opportunities that Sri Lanka has in this sector, primarily due to her advantageous location. The development of the Port of Galle into a multi-purpose port which will cater to transshipment and domestic containerised cargo as well as conventional cargo is also planned. A decision has been taken to call for fresh proposals to develop the Port of Galle on BOO/BOT basis. A feasibility study is underway to develop a new port at Oluvil in the Ampara district. The Government is also considering the erection of a new port for oil and dry cargo handling in the vicinity of Hambantota.

The total revenue of the SLPA increased by 22 per cent in 1997 after an 87 per cent increase in the previous year,

mainly due to substantial increases in port charges. The

growth in expenditure was 25 per cent. As a result, net profit

before tax of the SLPA rose by 13 per cent to Rs.2,780

million in 1997. Employment in port services increased.by

9 per cent.

5.7 Irrigation and Settlement Schemes

The Mahaweli Development Programme, which is the

largest ever multipurpose irrigation project undertaken by the

State,, has neared completion. The main activities during

1997 were systems development and rehabilitation activities.

The Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) has reported

that the total expenditure incurred during the year amounted

to Rs.847 million. The total extent cultivated under the

Mahaweli command area increased by 6 per cent from

120,500 hectares in 1996 to 128,250 hectares in 1997. The

extent under paddy increased by 10 per cent to 112,578

hectares, while the extent under other field crops decreased

by 13 per cent to 15,700 hectares. This may be attributed

to the fact that a better distribution of rainfall and higher

levels of water in irrigation tanks in 1997 compared to 1996,

enabled more land to be brought under paddy cultivation.

During 1997, several new projects were implemented by

the MASL. Rehabilitation work in system "H" commenced

in February and will continue up to the year 2003. On 6

August, the Huruluwewa Feeder Canal was gazetted as a

special area of the MASL. The implementation of the

Mahaweli Authority Restructuring Project to commercialise

activities of MASL commenced in December, with World

Bank assistance. This is expected to be completed by 2003.

The Walawe Left Bank Extension and Upgrading Project

was also inaugurated in December. Further, a sum of Kuwait

dinar 300,000 was negotiated for the Moragahakande Project

feasibility study. The rehabilitation and development of Zone

2 of System C and System G of the Mahaweli Consolidation

Project, funded by the European Economic Co.-operation

(EEC), was initiated during 1997. The project on Repairs and

Maintenance of the Polgolla and Walawe dam gates, funded

by the Japan International Co-operation Association (JICA)

was completed in the year, under review.

Operations in three major foreign funded projects

continued in 1997 as well. The Minipe Nagadeepa Irrigation

Rehabilitation Project (MNIRP) and the North Western

Province Special Irrigation Project (NWPSIP) have spent a

sum of Rs.361 million and Rs.44 million, respectively,

during the year. Eight schemes were to be completed in the

NWPSIP in 1997. The National Irrigation Rehabilitation

Project (NIRP), which has so far incurred the highest

expenditure out of the three major projects, had completed

work on 282 minoir irrigation projects up to 1997. Total

expenditure incurred on these projects in 1997 has been

estimated at Rs.917 million.

Locally funded irrigation projects too performed well in

1997. There are 12 projects under this programme and it is

planned to settle 7,370 families once the projects are

completed. The Irrigation Department has estimated the total

expenditure incurred on these projects in 1997 to be Rs.53.6

million.

Settlement activities under irrigation schemes continued

in 1997. Under the Mahaweli Programme, settlement

activities were carried out only in System B and System C

where 157 and 392 families, respectively, were settled.

Settlement activities were affected by the adverse security

situation. The total number of families settled under the

Mahaweli Programme from the year of inception of the

settlement programme up to 1997 was 92,071 families.

Participatory management in irrigation schemes was

promoted through the ongoing programme of 'Waphaula'.

During the year the programme was in operation in 152

major and medium irrigation schemes covering around

64,000 hectares. Of these schemes, 39 have been brought up

to the 'specified' status under the Irrigation (Amendment)

Act No. 13 of 1994. This means that the relevant farmer

organisation has been able to meet various requirements of

the Irrigation Department to prove its capacity of taking over

the operation and maintenance of the irrigation scheme from

the Irrigation Department. This also paves the way for the

farmer organisation to achieve corporate status under the

Agrarian Services Act and charge a fee from its membership

for irrigated water. Steps have been taken to bring an

additional 20 schemes up to the specified status depending

on the strength and capability of the farmer organisation.

5.8 Special Programmes

Housing

In the context of a growing urban population in the country, which is anticipated to be about one third of the total population by the year 2000, the major focus of the Government's housing policy in 1997 was the expansion of housing facilities in urban areas, while improving the quality of. estate and rural housing. In this regard, the scarcity of usable lands, high cost of construction, lack of investment and lack of affordability are some of the serious issues to be addressed by the. Government. Improvement in living conditions of existing urban settlements, providing adequate infrastructure and providing alternative accommodation to shanty and slum settlers are also serious issues that need the attention of the Government. The key strategies to address these urban sector issues were encouraging private sector led medium and large scale housing development, assisting lending institutions to improve their capital structure and constructing houses for specific low and middle income groups by the State. With respect to the rural sector, the provision of concessionary financial support and assistance in kind to lower income groups, assistance to plantation sector workers to improve their living quarters and promotion of housing settlements with basic amenities were the strategies adopted during the year.

With respect to the state sector, policies for housing

development activities are formulated under two approaches.

The first is to extend assistance to low income families to

build houses based on the enabling approach. The second is

to construct houses to relocate slum and shanty squatters by

making maximum use of land to liberate prime land for

optimum use on a provider basis. The National Housing

Development Authority (NHDA) which is responsible for

state sector housing programmes, directed seven major

programmes during the year under review. The major

projects in progress were the Jana Udana Programme. Rural

Housing Programme (RHP). Urban Housing Programme

(UHP), Estate Housing Programme (E.HP'). Direct

Construction Programme (DCP). Disaster Housing

Programme (DHP) and a Fisheries Housing Programme

(FHP).

There was moderate progress in the state sector housing

programme in 1997. The total number of units completed

. under the public sector housing programme rose by 10 per

cent to 32.548, while total loans and grants provided grew

by 17 per cent to Rs.619 mn. compared with the previous

year. In 1997 significant progress was made under the rural

sector housing programme, while activities under the 'Jana

Udana' slowed down compared with the previous year due

to delays in the release of lands. A new housing programme

commenced in 1997 to assist the fisheries families in 7

districts.

In 1997, the Plantation Housing and Social Welfare

Trust (PHSWT) continued to provide housing loans and

infrastructure facilities such as survey of lands, access roads,

water supply and sanitary facilities for estate workers under

the Social Welfare Progamme II (SWP II). Under this

programme, 718 units were completed in 1997 compared

with 460 units in 1996. New units and, upgradings under

construction were 2,937 in 1997 compared with 1,723 units

jn 1996. A sum of Rs.56 million was spent under the SWP

II during the year. Meanwhile, the Mahaweli Authority of

Sri Lanka completed 1,520 housing units in 1997 compared

with 2,283 units in 1996.

The role of private developers as well as housing financing institutions in accommodating the future housing demand is immense, particularly with respect to the urban sector. Considering the scarcity of land and the need to obtain the maximum use from it, there is an imperative need for the construction and development of multi-storeyed flats, housing complexes etc. However, the magnitude of the investment required is beyond the availability of public sector investment funds or the capacity of individuals. Hence, a rational incentive structure which will protect the interests of both housing developers and buyers is essential. In view of this need, incentives by way of tax concessions, provision of land and trust funds to invest in large and medium scale housing complexes, were introduced through the 1998 Budget.

Meanwhile, individual housing loans were provided at

market rates by the two state banks and other housing

financing institutions such as the State Mortgage and

Investment Bank (SMIB), National Savings Bank (NSB),

Housing Development Corporation of Sri Lanka Ltd.

(HDFC), Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka etc. In 1997,

the number of housing loans provided by the SMIB was

8,438 compared with 5,520 In 1996. Total loan

disbursements, amounting to Rs.l,378 million, recorded an

increase of 26 per cent between the two years. People's

Bank has introduced six new housing loan programmes for

armed service and police personnel, employees of Sri Lanka

Telecom Ltd., Air Lanka Ltd. and (ocal government service

employees and Members of Parliament. People's Bank had

granted 14,097 loans at a cost of Rs.641 million during the

first 10 months of 1997. According to People's Bank, the

repayment of housing loans granted against EPF balances

was at a very unsatisfactory level in 1997. There has been

a growing demand for housing loans provided by the NSB

in 1997 largely due to the low interest rates relative to other

housing financing institutions. In 1997, a total of 1,436 loans

were granted by the NSB, an increase of 11 per cent over

the previous year. The total value of loans disbursed was

Rs.839 million. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. has

granted 829 housing loans with a value of Rs.193 million

under the Rakshana Sevana Housing Loan Scheme. The

HDFC granted 3,298 housing loans in 1997, as against 9,261

housing loans in the previous year. The value of housing

loans at Rs 448 million indicated a decrease of 22 per cent

over the previous year. The HDFC introduced a special

housing scheme for officers in the armed and Police services

and for disabled soldiers.

Urban Development

The provision and maintenance of basic economic and

social infrastructure for urban communities is primarily in the

hands of local governments. Sri Lanka has 13 Municipal

Councils, 38 Urban Councils and 254 Pradeshiya Sabhas.

The Urban Development Authority (UDA) was established

in 1978 for the promotion of integrated planning and

development of urban areas in Sri Lanka. The responsibilities

entrusted to the UDA include the development of commercial

complexes, industrial estates, housing projects, administration

complexes, infrastructure development, and environmental

improvement. The UDA has declared over 150 local

authority areas for the purpose of promoting integrated

planning and physical development.

During 1997, the total cost of projects undertaken by

the UDA amounted to Rs.765 million compared to Rs.540

million in 1996. Of the total expenditure, Rs.608 million or

79 per cent was for the projects undertaken on behalf of

clients. Total expenditure incurred on the Urban

Development Sector Project (UDSP), which has been

categorised under client projects, was Rs.518 million, a 32

per cent increase over the previous year's expenditure. Under

the ADB funded UDSP, the infrastructure facilities in 17

small and medium size towns are being developed at a cost

of US dollars 36 million. Development of roads, bridges,

water supply and sanitation, drainage, solid waste collection

and disposal, low income.housing and small scale industrial

parks are some of the activities carried out under this Project.

The UDA spent Rs.53 million during the year for the

development activities of administrative, complexes at

Battaramulla and Pelawatte". Integrated development projects,

which include the construction of the Nittambuwa Shopping

Complex, Peliyagoda Development Scheme and

Panchikawatte Triangle, absorbed Rs.55 million. Under the

Town Improvement Project Rs.l6 million was spent on

improvement of low cost housing, public servants' housing

schemes and middle income housing schemes.

In addition to the above activities, the UDA undertook

85

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

several industrial development projects at Moderawila,

Peliyagoda and Homagama. The UDA has also prepared the

new landscape plan for the Galle Face Green area which is

now being implemented. In addition, the UDA undertook the

preparation of a Regional Structure Plan for the Colombo

Metropolitan Region as well as the development of the City

of Colombo. The draft final report is now being completed.

The preparation of the Kotte Capital City Development Plan

is also in progress.

Water Supply and Sanitation

In the sphere of water supply and sanitation, the major

policy thrust was to improve access to safe water and

provide adequate sanitation facilities especially in the rural

areas. The efficient use of all water resources, both surface

and underground, encouragement of private sector

participation, adoption of cost sharing, principles and

rationalisation of tariff policy have been identified as the key

strategies to be adopted in this area. By end 1997, 64 per

cent of the total population had access to safe drinking water

(pipe borne water facilities, tube wells and protected wells)

when compared to 61 per cent in 1996, while sanitation

facilities were available for about 64 per cent of the

population. In the urban areas, 91 per cent of the population

had access to water supply services. Access was low in the

rural sector (64 per ,cent), compared with South Korea (93

per cent), Thailand (89 per cent), Malaysia (78 per cent) and

the Philippines (86 per cent). The challenge ahead is to raise

the resources required for the necessary expansion and

improvement in the supply of water at cost effective prices.

In this regard, promotion of private sector participation

should be given serious consideration not only to expand the

water supply infrastructure, but also to remove the present

operational inefficiencies in the water supply sector.

The demand for water supply facilities continued to

grow in 1997. The National Water Supply and Drainage

Board (NWS&DB) as the main institution responsible for the

provision of water supply and sanitation facilities, operated

279 water schemes providing 270 million cubic meters of

water at the end of 1997. The number of connections

provided by the NWS&DB grew by 32,278 to 386,106 by

the end of 1997, Of the total new connections, 17216 or

53 per cent were provided to the rural sector while the rest

were provided to the urban sector in Municipal Council

(MC) and Urban Council (UC) areas.

The expansion in urban population, inadequate availability of safe water in rural areas and high growth in industrial and commercial businesses compelled higher investment in water supply in 1997. The NWS&DB spent a sum of Rs.2,900 million on the water supply sector during the year under review. Of this investment, 57 per cent was

received from foreign sources such as IDA, ADB. OECF and

ODA on concessional terms. The major water supply

schemes (WSS) continued during the year were the Ambatale

WSS, Towns East of Colombo WSS, Matara WSS. Towns

South of Colombo WSS, Deep Drilling in Hambantota area

and Udunuwara - Yatinuwara WSS. Meanwhile, with the

objective of expanding water supply coverage in rural areas,

the Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project

(CWSSP), funded by IDA. was in progress during the year.

The CWSSP continued in 1997 under sub-programmes such

as the Village Water Supply and Sanitation Programme, the

School Water Supply and Sanitation Programme and the

Small Town Water Supply and Sanitation Programme with

the aim of serving a 650,000 population in the Badulla,

Matara and Ratnapura Districts. Under this programme, 172

village water supply schemes and 98 school water supply

schemes have been completed during 1997. A sum of Rs.588

million was spent under the CWSSP during 1997 to expand

water supply facilities in rural areas under this project.

The improvement in commercial viability of the

NWS&DB became a prime concern during the year under

review. Tariff policy with respect to the water supply sector

is designed to cover operational and maintenance expenditure

and interest payments on investment loans obtained. The

NWS&DB revised the water tariff twice during 1997 after

3 years. Accordingly, the water tariff for the average

domestic consumer rose by 46 per cent in 1997 compared

with 199,6. The reduction of high cross subsidies from the

non-domestic sector to the domestic sector and re-couping

the escalation of the salary bill and overhead costs over the

last 3 years, were the major reasons.for this increase.

However, the average tariff rates for the industrial and

commercial sectors are still well above the average domestic

tariffs and domestic tariffs cover only 20 per cent of the

production cost. Hence, a rational pricing policy for water

reflecting its true cost is essential not only to improve the

efficiency of financial operations of the NWS&DB but also

to minimise wasteful consumption. Improvement of billing

procedures, reduction of the high level of unaccounted water

(37 per cent) resulting from leakage, unbilled consumption,

illegal tapping and lack of regular maintenance are major

areas of concern in improving operational as well as financial

efficiency of the water supply sector.

Integrated Rural Development Programme

The Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) commenced in 1979 with heavy investment in infrastructure development and provision of basic needs in rural areas. Since 1989, the programme has focussed attention on the involvement of the private sector in employment and income generating activities in rural areas. The participatory approach in rural development was strengthened after 1989. Since

86

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

1997, the IRDP is being re-oriented by the Ministry of Plan

Implementation and Parliamentary Affairs (MPIPA) as a

Rural Economic Advancement Programme (REAP)to focus

mainly on employment and income generating activities. The

management of most IRDPs was changed at the beginning

of 1997. In 1997, the IRDP consisted of 15 active projects

which covered nearly two thirds of the districts in the

country. The programmed budget for the IRDP in 1997 was

Rs.1,512 million of which Rs.1,375 million or 91 per cent

was utilised.

The Matara District IRDP made progress in activities

such as vocational training, transport improvement and rural

credit. A Rural Economic Advancement Programme was

implemented in the Dickwella and Devinuwara Divisional

Secretariat (DS) Divisions as pilot projects. The Hambantota

District IRDP concentrated on community development,

small scale business, development and skill development

activities. The long-term objective of the Nuwara Eliya

district IRDP is to alleviate poverty in the rural sector and

to promote economically and ecologically sustainable

development in the District. The mid term review mission

undertaken in May 1997 had underlined the need for a

change in orientation. The second Badulla District IRDP is

designed to alleviate poverty, and improve food security and

nutrition among the poorest rural households. The mid term

review mission in July 1997 had proposed the extension of

the project by another year up to 2000. Self -help community

development, village market centre development and land

regularisation were the new components included in the

project. The final phase of the Ratnapura District IRDP,

which was in progress in 1997, aimed at ensuring the

sustainability of the project.

Under the Moneragala District IRDP, considerable

progress was made in providing infrastructure facilities such

as school buildings, rural roads and rehabilitating minor

irrigation facilities. Education, health and agriculture

development projects had also made progress. Special

emphasis was paid to strengthening the. planning and

implementation capacity of local institutions. The Kalutara

District IRDP was completed in 1997 using government

funds, as foreign aid for the project had been fully utilised.

The main emphasis of the Kandy District IRDP is to

promote income generating activities for a targetted group.

The Gampaha District IRDP improved infrastructure facilities

(bridges and roads) in the rural areas. The Government of

Japan has provided technical assistance for agricultural

extension improvement in the Gampaha District. Farm

models have been developed at trial plots of various fanners

while a model farm has been developed at Ambepussa.

The year 1997 was the seventh year of implementation

of the Southern Province Rural Development Project. The

largest component of expenditure, about 44 per cent of total

expenditure of the IRDP in 1997. was spent on this project.

The main objective of the project is to raise the income and

quality of life of the people in the Province. In 1997,

progress was made in the construction of rural access roads,

in micro-credit projects and: training programmes. The

Puttalam District Integrated Basic Services Project was

concluded in 1996 and Rs.6.6 million was spent in 1997 on

consolidation work. The Human Resources and Institutional

Development Project aimed to improve the skills of officers

and institutional activities in regional development. Active

beneficiary participation. for project planning and

implementation was the main feature in the North Western

Province Dry' Zone Participatory Development Project. This

project aims to develop sustainable farming systems to

improve the living conditions of the rural poor.,The

Moneragala Irrigation and Community Development Project

covers'eight irrigation schemes in the District. The project

focuses on irrigation rehabilitation, agriculture and

community development to raise the living standards of the

. people residing around the irrigation schemes. The North

Central Province (NCP) Participatory Rural Development

Project is a very recent project implemented in the

Anuradhapura District benefiting 24.000 households.

Activities include livestock development and construction of

access roads in 350 villages, rehabilitation of 10 medium

irrigation schemes and improvement of primary health care.

The NCP Rural Development Project commenced in

1997 and covers both Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa

Districts. The main objective of the project is to generate

employment opportunities for youth and raise the income

level of nearly 43,000 households in rural areas. According

to the MPIPA, under the new concept of REAP, investment

was initiated in activities such as commercial farming and

rural enterprise development on a small scale in each project

district during 1997.

Samurdhi Programme

The Samurdhi Programme continued during the year

ensuring a minimum standard of living for the vulnerable

groups of society while also implementing programmes to

reduce unemployment among them. At the end of 1997,

there were 2.1 million families who had benefited under the

Samurdhi Programme as against an initial target of 1.2

million families. Accordingly, 55 per cent of the population

was receiving benefits under the Samurdhi Programme in

1997. The growing coverage of beneficiaries in the

programme should receive serious attention as it indicates a

major lapse in the monitoring and screening process of the

Programme. The poverty levels estimated in recent studies

are much lower, around 25 to 35 per cent of the population.

87

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

The Programme is administered at the national level by

3 institutions namely, the Department of Poor Relief (DPR),

the Department of the Samurdhi Commissioner General

(DSCG) and the Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka (SASL)

in addition to the Ministry of Samurdhi, Youth Affairs and

Sports which is the policy formulating authority. The DPR

is responsible for distribution of welfare payments among

Samurdhi beneficiaries. In addition, the DPR handles

distribution of dry ration cards for displaced families and the

distribution of special food stamps for lactating mothers in

Samurdhi families. Under the income support scheme, a

monthly payment of Rs.l ,000 is granted to about 2 per cent

of the beneficiaries who are considered to be ultra poor.

About 45 per cent of the families are receiving a monthly

allowance of Rs. 500 while the rest of the families are

receiving Rs.200 or Rs.100 depending on the number of

dependents in the family. The total cost incurred on the

income support scheme amounted to Rs.6,768 million in

1997.

With effect from August 1997, the Samurdhi subsidy

scheme was extended to cover the entire Eastern Province

and two Divisional Secretariat (DS) Divisions in the

Vavuniya District. A total of 18,542 families in these areas

were identified as suitable to receive Samurdhi benefits and

initially Rs.250 was paid to them monthly. Further, the DPR

continued to distribute dry ration cards to displaced families.

During 1997, 159,849 displaced families benefited under this

programme. The DPR also implemented a programme to

distribute nutritional cards worth Rs.100 to mothers in

Samurdhi households for a period of one year. Under this

programme, payments were made to 56,908 mothers at a

total cost of Rs.68 million during 1997. Meanwhile, the

former Janasaviya recipient families, totalling 407,000, were

also paid Rs.250 a month during 1997. The total cost of the

Janasaviya payments and relief payments was Rs.l,700

million. The total cost of all programmes under the DPR was

Rs.8,536 million in 1997.

The DSCG was established in 1994 with the objectives of development of human resources and institutions, implementation of a social insurance network, introduction of economic, social and Cultural development programmes and planning, monitoring and evaluating the Samurdhi programme. The DSCG has appointed three Samurdhi Niyamakas for each of the Grama Niladhari Divisions (or Samurdhi Balakayas) to implement the Samurdhi Programme at village level. During 1997, a total of 6,108 Samurdhi Niyamakas were newly appointed. Accordingly, at end 1997, a total of 32,029 Samurdhi Niyamakas, including 6,429 'Krushi' (Agricultural) Niyamakas, had been appointed in 272 DS Divisions in 22 districts,

The DSCG is also implementing a social insurance

scheme to support Samurdhi families to accommodate their

urgent or essential social activities. An insurance premium

of Rs.20 per month is charged on each Samurdhi beneficiary

family who receive Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 500 per month as

Samurdhi benefits. During 1997. a sum of Rs.197 million

was collected as insurance premium from 932,193 member

families, while Rs.170 million was paid in respect of 61291

claims. The DSCG had distributed 4,990 sewing machines

at a cost of Rs.16.5 million by end 1997, under the

Samurdhi Families Economic Development Programme.

The SASL is implementing a number of programmes

such as the Rural Community Projects (RCP), Compulsory

Savings Scheme, Voluntary Savings Scheme. Samurdhi

Pevelopment Credit Scheme (SASANA), Naya Niyamaka

Programme, Agricultural Development Work and Human

Resources Development Activities, aimed at uplifting the

economic and social infrastructure of the rural and backward

areas. Under the RCP, 9,454 sub-projects were completed

during 1997, at a cost of Rs.467 million. Further, the SASL

carried out 730 community projects at a cost of Rs.l34

million with assistance from the National Development Trust

Fund. The SASL also implemented a vocational training

programme for young people in Samurdhi beneficiary

families in 50 DS Divisions and 2,437 youths were trained

in 1997 under the programme.

Deposits in the compulsory savings fund increased by

80 per cent to Rs.2,725 million in 1997. Under the voluntary

savings programme, 33,450 small community groups had

saved Rs.506 million as at end September 1997. Meanwhile,

261 Samurdhi Banking Societies have been established as at

end 1997, with a membership of 267,784. The paid up share

capital of these banking societies was Rs.83.3 million and

deposits amounted to Rs.49.2 million. The SASANA is being

implemented in all DS Divisions except the Northern

Province and some DS Divisions in the East with funds to

the amount of Rs.500 million from Bank of Ceylon and

People's Bank. By end October 1997, the banks had granted

a total of Rs.402 million to 68265 borrowers in Samurdhi

families. The rate of interest for loans was 10 per cent per

annum while the loan recovery rate stood at 73 per cent.

5.9 Environment

The National Environmental Act No.. 47 of 1980 (NEA) gives the legal basis for protection and management of the environment in the country. The NEA was amended by Act No. 56 of 1988 to incorporate regulatory provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) procedures. The purposes of EIA are to ensure that the development options under consideration are environmentally sound and sustainable and that the environmental consequences are recognised and

taken into account early in the design of projects. In 1997, air emission standards for stationary sources were also finalised. However, these standards have not yet been gazetted. The Noise Level Regulations passed in 1996 were amended in 1997, in order to allow existing industries sufficient time to comply. Standards for colour in industrial affluents have also been developed during 1997.

During the year under review, 66 new site clearances

were issued for new industries against 406 clearances issued

in 1996. The number of new EPLs issued in 1997 totalled

163 when compared to 248 in 1996. Renewal of EPLs

lincreased from 305 in 1996 to 309 in 1997. During 1997,

the CEA processed 50 projects including 16 industrial

projects, 9 power and energy projects and 7 forestry projects

under EIA regulations. Of the total, 19 projects were

approved during the year, while one project for metal

quarrying was rejected. Evaluation of other projects was in

progress.

The CEA conducted an islandwide survey of industries,

except in the North and East, with the support of Local

Authorities, during 1997 to enumerate the actual number of

industries and their level of pollution. Data relating to

location of industries, manufactured products, raw materials,

including chemicals used in the production process, details

regarding waste generation, waste quantity and quality, waste

treatment methods and the number of employees were

collected in the survey. Compilation of data from the survey

is in progress. The programme to monitor major inland water

bodies in the country continued during 1997. Under this

programme the water quality in the Beira Lake, Kandy Lake,

Nuwara Eliya Lake, Kelani River and the Colombo Canal

System was monitored on a regular basis to detect pollution'

trends.

Under the Colombo Urban Transport Project, two fixed

air quality monitoring stations have been installed at the Fort

Railway Station and at the premises of the Meteorological

Department. Parameters such as the levels of sulfur dioxide,

oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and particulate matter

in ambient air were being monitored on a continuous basis

through these two fixed stations. The mobile air quality

monitoring station owned by the CEA carries out air quality

monitoring studies at specific locations as and when required.
