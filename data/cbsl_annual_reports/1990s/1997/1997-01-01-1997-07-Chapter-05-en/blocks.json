New degree courses in law policies, pharmacology, surveying and nursing were commissioned at the Universities of Colombo, Sri Jayawardenapura, Sabaragamuwa and the Open University. Professional guidance units were established in four universities with a view to providing information on employment opportunities available in the state sector as well as in the private sector. Projects were in progress to provide educational equipment and construct new building complexes at the Universities of Peradeniya and Sri Jayawardenapura at a cost of Rs. 1,925 million with Japanese aid. In addition several large construction projects have been undertaken to expand and upgrade the building complexes for the medical and engineering faculties at Peradeniya and Ruhuna during the year under review.",

However, national road maintenance expenditure increased only by 13 per cent, to Rs.266 million, during the year. Funds allocated for road maintenance are inadequate. With the present annual allocation, only about one tenth of the national road network can be maintained. Provincial Councils, (except the North-East Provincial Council) have reported that there are approximately 15,000 kilometers of roads under their purview. Total expenditure on roads incurred by the Provincial Councils (PCs) decreased by 7 per cent to Rs. 724 million in 1997.

However, periodic and routine maintenance of roads has not been in keeping with the expansion of economic activities and the increasing vehicle fleet. Inadequate allocation of funds has been the major impediment to satisfactory maintenance. As a result, road conditions, particularly those of provincial and local roads, have deteriorated considerably over the years, thereby, increasing transport costs. It has been observed that available resources have not been properly utilised to derive the maximum benefit due to poor co-ordination and weak monitoring of road maintenance by various institutions, in particular, at provincial and local levels.",

Additional investment is needed for upgrading and modernising the outdated railway infrastructure which causes frequent derailment and enforcement of number of speed limits. The depleting rolling stock position restricts operations and causes cancellation of scheduled services.

A decision has been taken to call for fresh proposals to develop the Port of Galle on BOO/BOT basis. A feasibility study is underway to develop a new port at Oluvil in the Ampara district. The Government is also considering the erection of a new port for oil and dry cargo handling in the vicinity of Hambantota.",

In this regard, the scarcity of usable lands, high cost of construction, lack of investment and lack of affordability are some of the serious issues to be addressed by the. Government. Improvement in living conditions of existing urban settlements, providing adequate infrastructure and providing alternative accommodation to shanty and slum settlers are also serious issues that need the attention of the Government. The key strategies to address these urban sector issues were encouraging private sector led medium and large scale housing development, assisting lending institutions to improve their capital structure and constructing houses for specific low and middle income groups by the State. With respect to the rural sector, the provision of concessionary financial support and assistance in kind to lower income groups, assistance to plantation sector workers to improve their living quarters and promotion of housing settlements with basic amenities were the strategies adopted during the year.",

Considering the scarcity of land and the need to obtain the maximum use from it, there is an imperative need for the construction and development of multi-storeyed flats, housing complexes etc. However, the magnitude of the investment required is beyond the availability of public sector investment funds or the capacity of individuals. Hence, a rational incentive structure which will protect the interests of both housing developers and buyers is essential. In view of this need, incentives by way of tax concessions, provision of land and trust funds to invest in large and medium scale housing complexes, were introduced through the 1998 Budget.",
