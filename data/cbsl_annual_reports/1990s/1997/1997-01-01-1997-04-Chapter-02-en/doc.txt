2. NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

2.1 Overall Trends

In 1997, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by

6.4 per cent in real terms, recovering strongly from the

previous year's modest economic performance. The GDP

growth in 1997 was notably higher than the average growth

rate of 5.2 per cent during the past five year period 1992-

96. Following the setback during the first half of 1996, the

economy recovered during the second half. This growth

process accelerated in 1997. The Agriculture sector, which

was adversely affected by the prolonged drought in 1996,

recovered in 1997. The Manufacturing, Construction and

Services sectors also performed well in 1997 contributing to

faster economic growth.

The Gross National Product (GNP),.defined as the GDP

adjusted for net factor income from abroad, grew by' a higher

6.9 per cent. The net factor income from, abroad increased

due' to an increase in investment income receipts reflecting

interest income on a higher level of foreign assets invested

abroad and a decline in interest payments on foreign debt.

The GDP at current market prices was estimated at

Rs.890 billion. The mid year population was estimated to

have increased by 1.3 per cent to 18.6 million in 1997.

Accordingly, the per capita GDP rose to Rs.47,999 (US

dollars 814) in 1997. Sri Lanka is gradually approaching the

income level of a middle income country and therefore,

access to concessional and foreign funds for further

development work would diminish gradually. Hence, in the

future, a growing share of funds for development projects

will have to be raised in foreign capital markets. The

Government successfully launched a Floating Rate Notes

issue for US dollars 50 million in the international capital

market in March 1997 with a view to establishing a bench

mark interest rate for Sri Lanka in international markets.

The domestic investment climate became mote

favourable in 1997. The reduction of interest rates,

moderation of inflation and improved fiscal discipline helped

to maintain the domestic financial markets relatively stable

in the context of highly volatile international financial

markets. The improved economic fundamentals have fostered

greater investor confidence. These had a favourable impact

on economic growth in 1997. The higher growth rate also

reflected the recovery of economic activities from depressed

conditions in the previous year. There was a slight upturn

in the stock market and corporate profits improved during

the year. There was also an increase in the inflow of foreign

direct investment but the inflows from the East Asian region

were below the anticipated levels as the pledged foreign

investment from some of these countries was held back due

to their currency crisis. There was also an easing of labour

unrest in 1997. However, rigidities, particularly in labour

markets and insufficient infrastructure facilities, continued as

obstacles to faster growth in private investment, while high

security expenditure also absorbed resources away from

productive investment. Despite these. Gross Domestic Capital

Formation (GDCF) increased to maintain its ratio to GDP

at a slightly higher level than in 1996.

The Agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.1 per

cent in real terms, contributing 8.4 per cent to the growth

in real GDP in 1997. The output of three major agricultural

crops, tea, coconut and paddy, increased while rubber

production declined. Tea production recorded a further

growth of 7.2 per cent over the previous year and reached

a new peak production level of 277 million kilograms. The

continuous growth in tea production since 1993 is a

noteworthy feature. Tea producers also gained by the

continued increase in international tea prices in 1996 and

1997. The paddy output in 1997 increased by 8.6 per cent

and this helped to reduce the outlay on rice imports. The

recovery in the coconut sub-sector was slow since the

production responds to weather conditions with a time lag

of about one year. The fisheries sub-sector, which

experienced a setback in 1996. also recovered during the

year, recording an increase in the output of marine fish and

fresh water fish.

The Manufacturing sector grew by 9.3 per cent in 1997,

compared to 6.5 per cent in 1996 and contributed 29 per

cent of the overall economic growth. The export oriented

industries continued to provide an impetus to economic

growth. Industrial exports account for about two thirds of

industrial production and are the most important sub-sector

in the Manufacturing sector. The export value of industrial

products increased by 14.3 per cent from US dollars 3,006

million in 1996, to US dollars 3,436 million in 1997. The

export volume index of manufactured goods increased by

11.1 per cent in 1997 when compared to 4.7 per cent in

1996. In addition to the growth in export demand, the major

factors which contributed to improving the performance of

the Manufacturing sector in 1997 were the enhancement of

the electricity generating capacity, easing of industrial labour

unrest and the incentives for the industrial sector offered in

the last two Budgets.

Despite a decline in the hydro power generation during

the first half of the year, increased thermal power generation

by the Ceylon Electricity Board and the private sector helped to avoid interruptions to the power supply in 1997. The installed generation capacity of electricity supplied through the national grid increased by 12 per cent with the commissioning of three new thermal electricity supply stations. The supply mix of 65 per cent of hydro electricity and 35 per cent thermal electricity reduced the over dependence on hydro electricity resulting in a more reliable power supply. The capacity of power generation by the Ceylon Electricity Board was increased in 1997 for the first time after the. commissioning of the Samanalawewa hydro power project in 1992. The Services sector performed better than last year, reflecting the growth in demand for services that accompanied the expansion of the Agriculture, Manufacturing and Construction sectors and the recovery in tourism. Moreover, the modernisation and expansion programmes that, took place in the sub-sectors of finance,

port and dockyard services and communications have

contributed to enhancing the output of the Services sector.

The Services sector grew by 7 per cent in 1997 contributing

to 56 per cent of the increase in real GNP. This sector

accounted for 51 per cent of GNP in 1997.

GDP at current factor cost prices increased by 15.5 per cent to Rs.804 billion in 1997. Accordingly, the implicit GDP price deflator, a measure of the overall price level in the economy, increased by 8.5 per cent, compared to an increase of 12.1 per cent in 1996. This reflected the trends in other aggregate price indicators in 1997.

Gross Domestic Expenditure at current market prices

was estimated to be Rs.953 billion in 1997, reflecting an

increase of 13.9 per cent. Consumption expenditure, which

represents the largest share in overall expenditure, rose by

26

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

13.2 per cent in 1997. When viewed in relation to the

increase in the consumer prices of 7-10 per cent in 1997,

this indicates an increase in real consumption. However, it

is noteworthy that consumption as a percentage of GDP

declined reflecting an increase in the marginal propensity to

save with increasing per capita income, despite a reduction

in real interest rates. This increase needs, to be sustained by

maintaining real interest rates at a positive level and

reasonably attractive to depositors. Private consumption

expenditure at current prices increased at a rate of 13.1 per

cent in 1997 when compared to 16.4 per cent in 1996. The

increase in consumption expenditure is reflected by various

indicators such as the increase in the volume of imports of

consumption goods, a rise in the collection of sales and

services taxes and an increase in new registration of

passenger cars and motorcycles. Household demand for

services including transport, telecommunication and

electricity, also expanded in 1997. Public consumption

expenditure, comprising salaries and. wages and outlay on

goods and services in Government institutions, registered an

increase of 13.8 per cent in 1997, in comparison to 5.8 per

cent in 1996. '

• Gross Domestic Capital Formation was estimated to have risen by 16.6 per cent to Rs.217 billion in 1997. The ratio of Gross Domestic Capital Formation to GDP increased from 24.2 per cent in 1996 to 24.4 per cent in 1997. Private investment increased from 18 per cent of GDP to 18.9 per cent of GDP. Public investment however declined from 6.2 per cent in 1996 to 5.5 per cent. The expansion in capital formation was reflected through a number of indicators including a rise in the imports of capital goods, an increase in the sales volume of major construction materials, a growth in loans and advances granted by the banking system and an increase in foreign direct investment. The core-programmes within public investments were human resource development, transport and economic infrastructure. These accounted for 53 per cent of the overall public investment expenditure. The Gross Domestic Savings ratio increased from 15.3 per cent in 1996 to 17.3 per cent in 1997. A decline in the Government's dis-savings, mainly through rationalisation and economising of public spending and an increase in private sector savings, mainly due to higher corporate savings, have resulted in a higher savings rate in 1997 when compared to 1996. The national savings ratio increased from 19.0 per cent in 1996 to 21.4 per cent in 1997.

22 Sectoral Performance

The Agriculture sector, which includes forestry and

fishing, grew by 3.1 per cent in 1997 mainly due to the

growth in tea and the recovery in the paddy, coconut and

fisheries sub-sectors. The combined output of paddy in the

1996/97 Maha season and the 1997 Yala season is estimated

at 2.24 million metric tons, an increase of 8.6 per cent when

compared to the output in 1996. The plantation sector as a

whole performed well during 1997, with tea production

increasing by 7.2 per. cent mainly due to improved

management under the private sector and a moderate

recovery of 3.3 per cent in coconut production. The Colombo

Auction average price for tea during 1997 was Rs.l 19.40 per

kg, an increase of 14.5 per cent when compared with the

average price in 1996. The higher prices were largely due

to the tight world supply situation and increased demand for

Sri Lanka tea from the CIS countries. The high prices augur

well for the tea sub-sector as rising producer margins will

enable investment in tea plantations and factories. Rubber

production in 1997 declined by 5.8 per cent as the

production during the last quarter was affected by heavy

rains. In addition, the decline in the producer prices also led.

to an erosion of producer margins while there was upward

pressure on cost of production due to continuing labour

shortages,

Other agriculture, which accounts for 52 per cent of the

. value added in the total Agriculture sector, increased

marginally by 0.5 per cent in 1997. In this sub-sector,

increases in production were recorded in .vegetables, minor

export crops and animal husbandry products. While, the output

of subsidiary food crops, fruits and sugarcane declined. The

slow growth in this sub-sector is reflected by a decline in

fertilizer use (by 5 per cent) and higher imports of chillies,

onions, potatoes and vegetables during the year when

compared to 1996.

The fisheries sub-sector, which suffered a setback in

1996, also recovered with both marine and fresh water fish

production recording increases. Accordingly, the output in the

fisheries sub-sector has grown by 5 per cent with total fish

production increasing from 228,550 MT in 1996 to 240,000

MT in 1997.

The Mining and Quarrying sector grew by 3.4 per cent in 1997, reflecting the growth of output of the major quarrying products and aggregate stones and clay for bricks and tiles as a result of the expansion in construction activities. However, this growth rate was lower than in 1996. The export demand for gems and geuda slackened during the second half of the year due to the financial market and currency crisis in East Asia and the. drop in demand from Japan. The extraction of mineral sands and graphite also declined in 1997. Export earnings from minerals in 1997 remained at US dollars 90 million as in 1996, while the volume of minerals exported declined by 4 per cent in 1997.

27

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

The Manufacturing sector, which includes factory

industry, processing of tea, rubber and coconut kernel

products and small industries, grew by 9.3 per cent in 1997,

when compared to 6.5 per cent in 1996. The factory industry

sub-sector, which represents more than 80 per cent of the

overall manufacturing sector, registered a growth of 10.3 per

cent, in real terms, against a background of reduced labour

unrest, a robust external demand for industrial products and

further incentives offered in the 1997 Budget for export

oriented industrial production. In 1997, industrial exports

grew by 11 per cent in volume, with exports of garments

continuing to lead with an export volume growth of 11.8 per

cent. A substantial rise in exports of leather and rubber

goods was also recorded. Industrial exports at Rs.203 billion

accounted for 74 per cent of Sri Lanka's export earnings in

1997. An increase in the output of tea and coconut kernel

products led to a higher growth rate (3 per cent), in the agro-

processing industry, when compared to 1.0 per cent in 1996.

A growth rate of 7.0 per cent was recorded in the small

industries sub-sector. Recovery in agriculture, expansion in

construction activity and an up-turn in tourism led to a better

performance in the small industries sub-sector in 1997, when

compared to the previous year. Paddy milling, the agro-

processing- industry of other non-plantation crops,

manufacture of bricks, wood-work and metal fabrication

work related to the construction industry and the handicraft

industry catering largely to the tourist industry, expanded

during the year. Small industries play an important role in

the context of employment generation, dispersion of

industrial production into rural areas and developing inter-

sectoral linkages in production. Recognising these aspects,

the Government through the 1997 Budget extended to the

small industries which export their products, some of the

incentives which were in place for the large scale industrial

enterprises, such as tax holidays, turnover tax and duty

waivers. A noteworthy development in recent years which

is taking place within the small industries sub-sector is

assembling of computers, communication equipment and

other electronic equipment which are increasingly undertaken

in small scale enterprises. This movement to higher

technology industries augurs well, especially in the context

of providing employment avenues to the educated and the

technically skilled work force.

The Construction sector grew by 5.4 per cent in 1997 compared to a lower growth rate of 3.4 per cent in 1996. The expansion in construction was mainly due to an increase in the construction of buildings for residential and commercial purposes, road construction and rehabilitation and maintenance of irrigation. This trend was consistent with the increase in the sales of basic inputs to construction such as cement, roofing materials and steel.

The Transport, storage and communication sector grew

by 7.8 per cent in 1997. Within this sector, the

communication sub-sector maintained a high growth

momentum benefiting from the infrastructure expansion

under both Sri Lanka Telecom and private sector companies.

Port services, which grew by 16 per cent in 1996, performed

even better in 1997. The growth of port services was seen

in the areas of cargo handling, container throughput and

transshipment cargo handling. These activities recorded

growth rates of 18 per cent. 24 per cent and 16 per cent,

respectively. The number of ships calling at the Colombo

Port increased by 5 per cent. With these developments, the

Port of Colombo also indicated improvements in efficiency

by increasing the net gantry moves from 23 in 1996 to 26

in 1997. However, cargo handling at the Ports of

Trincomalee and Galle recorded declines. Despite these

developments, there are areas of concern for the future

development of port activities. The Port of Colombo

encountered difficulties in handling cargo due to capacity

limitations resulting in a significant increase in the turn­

around time of cargo vessels. An expansion in dockyard

services contributed to a better performance in the port

services sub-sector during the year under review.

The number of subscribers under Sri Lanka Telecom

and private companies recorded significant increases during

1997 compared to 1996. The number of new subscribers

under Sri Lanka Telecom was 28300 at end 1997 compared

to 22,800 at end 1996. The new subscribers under private

sector telecommunication services were 35,616 at end 1997

compared to 21,928 at end 1996. The services improved

further in the second half of the year with the expansion

projects of the two newcomers i.e., Suntel and Lanka Bell

in supplying telecommunication services. Meanwhile, the

acquisition of a 35 per cent share of Sri Lanka Telecom by

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) of

Japan and its expansion projects with production and

management efficiency through the use of modem techniques

also contributed to raise the value addition in this sector.

With the developments in the telecommunication sector, the

telephone density, which is the number of persons per

telephone, improved from 72 in 1996 to 58 in 1997. The

expansion of the telecommunication sector was accompanied

by improvements in quality and efficiency with the

introduction of new services such as telephone hunting

facilities, abbreviated dialling, absentee services, call waiting,

call forwarding and conference calls.

The transport sub-sector, which includes road, rail and air transport services, grew by 4.7 per cent in 1997. The expansion in the road transport services is largely the outcome of the expansion in the Agriculture, Manufacturing and Construction sectors leading to an increase in the demand for goods transportation. The growth in the tourist

28

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

industry enabled a recovery in air transport services. The

number of passenger kilometers flown by Air Lanka

increased to 4,304 million in 1997 from 3,809 million in

1996.

(a) Provisional (b) Subsidiary food crops mainly include potatoes, chillies, red onions, big onions, green gram, cowpea and kurakkan. (c) Minor export crops mainly include coffee, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, cashew nuts and betel leaves. (d) Animal Husbandry comprises milk, eggs, poultry and other meats.

The impetus to the growth in Wholesale and retail trade

was mainly from the expansion in external trade. In real

terms, imports rose by 10.5 per cent and exports by 11.6

per cent in 1997. The share of Wholesale and retail trade

in total GDP increased to 22 per cent in 1997 while its

contribution to the overall GDP growth during the year was

22.4 per cent.

The Banking, real estate and financial services sector

recorded a growth rate of 9.8 per cent in 1997. With the

reduction in the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) and

the increased inflow of foreign funds into the financial

system, the availability of liquidity in commercial banks

increased. The reduction in the SRR also reduced the

effective cost of funds of commercial banks. Although

commercial banks reduced their lending rates somewhat, they

decreased their deposit rates even more, thus resulting in a

widening of the margin between lending rates and deposit

rates. This, together with the increase in economic activity,

had a positive impact on the profitability of the commercial

banking sector in 1997. , .

The tourism sector recovered with tourist arrivals

increasing by 21 per cent over 1996, to reach 366,165 in

1997. Gross earnings from tourism increased from US dollars

166 million in 1996 to US dollars 209 million in 1997, an

increase of 26 per cent. With the growth in tourist arrivals;

the room occupancy rate in graded hotels rose from 39 per

cent in 1996 to 48 per cent in 1997, leading to an expansion

of hotel services.

2 3 Expenditure

Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE), the sum of

consumption expenditure and Gross Domestic Capital

Formation, was estimated at Rs.953 billion, showing an

increase of 13.9 per cent in 1997.

Consumption expenditure was estimated at Rs.736 billion in 1997, a 13.2 per cent increase over the Rs.650 billion in 1996. Private consumption expenditure, which represents about 87 per cent of the overall consumption expenditure, registered a growth of 13.1 per cent, increasing from Rs;569 billion in 1996 to Rs.644 billion in 1997. Private consumption expenditure on imported goods and non-

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

factor services rose at a higher rate due to a rise in

consumption expenditure on consumer durables, including

motor cars and motor cycles, and services, namely in foreign

travel. Within the domestically produced goods and services,

consumption expenditure on food items and manufactured

products recorded a significant growth, contributing to more

than 69 per cent of the overall increase in Private

Consumption Expenditure.

. Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF) is estimated

to have increased by 1.6.6 per cent to Rs.217 billion in 1997.

Private investment amounted to Rs.169 billion, while its

share to overall GDCF was 78 per cent. The increase in

private investment is mainly attributed to an improvement in

the investment climate. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of

Rs.7,873 million (US dollars 134 million) and gross inflows

of long-term foreign capital to the private sector of Rs.10,602

million (US dollars 176 million) together financed 11 per

cent of total private investment in 1997 as in 1996. Capital

formation in the government sector, which reflects its

acquisition of real assets to enhance the capital stock of

government ministries and departments under the Public

Investment Programme (PIP), increased by 27.4 per cent to

Rs.30,000 million. Meanwhile investments by public

enterprises and corporations increased by a marginal 2.3 per

cent, to Rs. 49 billion in 1997, when compared to a decline

of 10 per cent in 1996.

Increased capital formation was also reflected in the increase in the volume of imports of investment goods by 6 per cent. The imported goods content of domestic investment in 1997 remained at 36 per cent as in 1996. Within investment goods, substantial increases were recorded in machinery and equipment (5.3 per cent), transport equipment (10.9 per cent) and building materials (9.5 per cent). The composition of investment goods in 1997 shows that capital formation was mainly in the Manufacturing and Transport, Storage and Communication sectors. Within the Manufacturing sector, a higher proportion was absorbed in the industries of food and beverages and textiles and wearing apparel:

2.4 Availability and Utilisation of Resources

The total resources available to the economy, comprising Gross Domestic Product and imports of goods and non-factor services (foreign resources) increased to Rs.l,278 billion in 1997 from Rs.l,105 billion in 1996. This increase of Rs.173 billion was generated by a Rs.122 billion increase in GDP at current market prices and a Rs.51 billion increase in foreign resources.
