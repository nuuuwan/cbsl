The installed generation capacity of electricity supplied through the national grid increased by 12 per cent with the commissioning of three new thermal electricity supply stations. The supply mix of 65 per cent of hydro electricity and 35 per cent thermal electricity reduced the over dependence on hydro electricity resulting in a more reliable power supply. The capacity of power generation by the Ceylon Electricity Board was increased in 1997 for the first time after the. commissioning of the Samanalawewa hydro power project in 1992. The Services sector performed better than last year, reflecting the growth in demand for services that accompanied the expansion of the Agriculture, Manufacturing and Construction sectors and the recovery in tourism. Moreover, the modernisation and expansion programmes that, took place in the sub-sectors of finance,",

The ratio of Gross Domestic Capital Formation to GDP increased from 24.2 per cent in 1996 to 24.4 per cent in 1997. Private investment increased from 18 per cent of GDP to 18.9 per cent of GDP. Public investment however declined from 6.2 per cent in 1996 to 5.5 per cent. The expansion in capital formation was reflected through a number of indicators including a rise in the imports of capital goods, an increase in the sales volume of major construction materials, a growth in loans and advances granted by the banking system and an increase in foreign direct investment. The core-programmes within public investments were human resource development, transport and economic infrastructure. These accounted for 53 per cent of the overall public investment expenditure. The Gross Domestic Savings ratio increased from 15.3 per cent in 1996 to 17.3 per cent in 1997. A decline in the Government's dis-savings, mainly through rationalisation and economising of public spending and an increase in private sector savings, mainly due to higher corporate savings, have resulted in a higher savings rate in 1997 when compared to 1996. The national savings ratio increased from 19.0 per cent in 1996 to 21.4 per cent in 1997.",
