6. PRICES AND WAGES

6.1 Prices

There was a sharp deceleration of inflation during 1997,

in spite of increases in some administered prices, mainly due

to an improved supply of domestic consumer goods and

imported goods, and reduced demand pressure that resulted

from a moderation of monetary expansion. The supply of

domestic goods improved with the recovery in domestic

agriculture. In addition, the availability of imported consumer

goods improved after the removal of the licensing

requirements on onions, potatoes and chillies in 1996.

Further, the granting of temporary duty waivers and

reductions for selected consumer items also helped to contain

inflation. The favourable impact of the above factors was

somewhat offset by the increase in the administered price of

wheat flour and the consequent rise in bread prices in August

1997, the upward revision of the tariffs on electricity in

September 1997 and the increase in the price of cigarettes

in June 1997. The depreciation of the rupee by about 7 per

cent against the dollar during the year also exerted upward

pressure on the prices of imports.

The rate of. increase in the general price level declined

in 1997. This was reflected in all major aggregate price

indicators. The increase in consumer prices according to the

Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), the official

measure of inflation, declined from 15.9 per cent in 1996

to 9.6 per cent in 1997. The Greater Colombo Consumers'

Price Index (GCPI), which has a wider coverage than the

CCPI, showed a faster decline in the consumer price

increases, from 14.7 per cent in 1996 to 7.1 per cent in

1997. The annual average increase in prices at the primary

market level, as reflected in the Wholesale Price Index

(WPI), was 6.9 per cent in 1997 compared to 20.5 per cent

in 1996. The overall general price level in the economy as

reflected in the implicit Gross National Product Deflator

(GNPD) decreased from 12.2 per cent in 1996 to 8.5 per

cent in 1997. Meanwhile, the new consumer price index

computed by the Central Bank for the Colombo District,

based on consumption data of the first round of the

Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey 1996/97,

showed a rate of inflation of 7.3 per cent for 1997.

The price behaviour during 1997 followed the normal

seasonal pattern. Price increases during the first quarter of

the year were slow, with the CCPI registering declines

during February and March, which correspond to the major

paddy harvesting (Maha) season. Price decelerations were

also seen during the period August to October with the

minor harvesting (Yala) season. However, as a result of

unusually heavy and prolonged rains, there was a sharp

upsurge in prices in the last two months of 1997. As a result,

the point to point increase in the CCPI (measured by

comparing the index number of a particular month with that

of the corresponding month of the previous year), which had

moved down to a low of 6.5 per cent in October from a

high level of 16.7 per cent in January, underwent a reversal

after November, rising to 10.7 per cent by the end of the

year. The heavy rains during November and December

caused severe damage to vegetable crops and affected the

processing of rice for the market.

Colombo Consumers' Price Index

The slower increase of the Colombo Consumers' Price Index in 1997 reflected slower growth in prices of the food, fuel and light, and miscellaneous categories.

Food prices contributed to 81 per cent of the overall

increase in the Index as compared with 83 per cent in 1996.

The overall increase in food prices was 10.9 per cent during

the year, much slower than the 19.2 per cent registered in

1996. The price of wheat flour, which underwent several

revisions in 1996, was raised further from Rs.16.95 to

Rs.18.95 per kg. in August. As a consequence, the price of

a loaf of bread (450 gms.) rose by about one rupee or 13

per cent. However, the price of rice, the main staple, was

contained to an increase of ll -12 per cent, from over 20

per cent in the previous year. Paddy production during the

year was higher by 9 per cent. Overall, as in 1996, cereal

products contributed to around 30 per cent of the increase

in the CCPI in 1997. The price of coconuts, which had risen

by over 50 per cent during 1996, increased by around 13

per cent in 1997. As a result of duty concessions granted

on the import of edible oils and slack world prices, the price

of coconut oil decreased slightly during the year. The price

of sugar also declined by about 5 per cent as a lower import

duty was applicable until August 1997. Price declines were

registered for major subsidiary food crops such as chillies,

onions and potatoes mainly due to the abundant availability

of imports in the market in the absence of licensing

requirements. However, the price of vegetables rose sharply

towards the end of the year due to crop damage caused by

rains. In fact, vegetables alone accounted for over 30 per

cent of the overall increase in the CCPI in 1997.

In the clothing category, prices rose by 2.7 per cent in

1997 compared to a 2.2 per cent increase in 1996. Although

a substantial liberalisation of textile imports without import

duties was announced in the November Budget, the full

impact was not felt during the year. Prices in the fuel and

light category rose by 4.5 per cent in 1997, a much slower

increase than the 8.1 per cent increase experienced during

1996. Within this category, the price revision of kerosene in

September, 1996 had its full impact in 1997. The tariffs on

electricity were also raised upward in September. 1997.

However, the increase in the price of firewood was

moderate. The fuel and light group contributed about 4 per

cent to the overall increase in the Index.

In the miscellaneous category, prices rose by 8.2 per

cent, somewhat lower than the 10.8 per cent increase

registered in 1996. Increased prices of cigarettes and toilet

requisites, as well as higher cost of laundry and

entertainment, were the major contributory factors. Overall,

the contribution of miscellaneous items to the increase in the

CCPI was about 14 per cent.

Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index

In 1997, the Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index

registered an increase of 7.1 per cent, which was less than

half of the increase of 14.7 per cent registered last year. As

observed in the past, the GCPI continued to reflect a lower,

increase than the CCPI. In fact, the disparity between the

two indices which had narrowed in 1996, widened in 1997,

due to the differences in the weighting structure. In

particular, the sharp rise in the price of vegetables made a

bigger impact on the CCPI than the GCPI by virtue of the

higher weight given to vegetables in the former Index.

Prices in the food and drink category of the GCPI

registered an increase of 7.5 per cent, substantially lower

than the increase of 17.9 per cent registered last year. Price

A Measure of Underlying Inflation

In Srt Lanka inflation is generally measured by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI i which is the official price index computed by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) The Greater Colombo Price Index (GCPI) computed by the DCS is also used to measuic inflation. The other major indicators of inflation aie the GDP deflator and Wholesale Price Index computed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Maintaining prices at a low and stable level is the pi unary objective of monetary polity. Ideally, all prices should be fully determined in the market, and stability in such unregulated prices would be a reflection of overall macroeconomic stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy in containing inflation. There arc peimanent and transitory components of price changes Thercfoie, for effective policy formulation, it is essential to decompose the two components in the measuicd inflation indicatoi. In this context, it is necessary to exclude the effects of temporary shocks from the price indices so as to derive the 'underlying inflation' 01 'core inflation' as against the 'headline' inflation as reflected in the original price indices, In measuring mulct lying inflation, countries use various methods to eliminate supply side shocks.' In the United States for example, sub components of the consumer price index such as food and energy prices arc excluded Food prices aie excluded as they are volatile and erratic while eneigy prices are excluded on the grounds that they arc determined by the Government and as such, arc largely umelated to demand pressures in the economy In the United Kingdom, mortgage interest costs are excluded from the headline rate in order to obtain the underlying late.

In Sri Lanka prices of several consumer goods, i.e., wheat flour, bread, kerosene, electricity, transport fares.

1 The most common method used is adjustmentby exclusion or replacement which involves removing or replacing sub-components of the aggregate price index, the behaviour of which is judged to differ from the trend in underlying inflation Other methods, which are referred to as trimming methods, involve removing price changes beyond a specific threshold on the premise that extreme price movements reflect primarily supply shocks. Using the weighted median of price changes as the underlying rate is another alternative measure of underlying inflation.

cigarettes and liquor, are administratively determined hy the Government. Among these item1! with 'administered' prices, wheat flour, bread, kerosene and tobacco have high weights (with a combined current weight of about 16 per cent) in the CCPI and thus, pnee changes in these items have considerable influence on inflation. The prices of these items were revised on several occasions during the last two years (Table 11.

In arriving at an estimate of underlying inflation, these items should be excluded front the basket of the CCPI and the price change in the residual basket can be used as a measure foi underlying inflation. In early 1996. the effect ot the sharp reduction in the administered prices of bread, wheat flour and keiosene in the latter part of 1994 continued to be felt in the inflation rate measured by the unadjusted CCPI and therefore, the unadjusted rate fell below the undetlying rate (Tabic 2 and Chan l> Similaiiy. adjusted for upward price revisions effected since April 1996, the underlying inflation rate lies below the headline rate fiom July 1996 onwards

However, the above is not an exact measure of core inflation, it still inherits the various weaknesses of the CCPI and further refinements need to be made to obtain a more appropriate indicator of tore inflation in Sn Lanka

Consumer Price Index for Colombo District

A consumer price index for the Colombo District was computed by the Central Bank, based on results of the first round of the Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey (CFS) 1996/97. The consumer basket for the index was chosen using the consumption pattern of the lowest 40 per

cent of households (when ranked by income) covered by the survey in the Colombo District.

All non-durable consumption items (totalling 325) indicated by the survey were taken into account in computing the weights for the index. These items were grouped into five sub categories, namely food, clothing, fuel and light, rent and miscellaneous items, for each of which separate sub indices were computed. Food is the largest category, accounting for 60 per cent of the index, but this is much lower than the food component in the CCPI which currently stands at 72 per cent.

The base value of the index was arrived at using average prices during the period October to December. 1996 and therefore, the base of the index is October - December 1996 (= 100). Prices are collected from five market centres - Pettah, Homagama, Hanwella. Avissawella and Moratuwa. once a week for most food items and once a month for clothing and grocery items. Price data for administratively regulated items such as wheat flour, bread, electricity, cigarettes, liquor, gas etc. are collected whenever prices are changed.

The index was computed for the period January 1996

- December 1997. This shows an inflation of 7.3 per cent

in 1997 and it is closer to the inflation rate of 7.1 per cent

reflected by the GCPI but lower than the 9.6 per cent

inflation reflected by the CCPI. The lower rate reflects the

differences in the weight structure due to changing

consumption patterns. Administered price items, vegetables

and fish have lower weights in the new index.

However the results obtained through the new index

should be interpreted with caution, mainly because of the

fact that the consumer basket was computed using only the

first round results of the CFS survey covering the period

October - December 1996. Therefore, the size of the

household sample used is also small. The seasonal pattern

of consumer expenditure in the reference period may have

affected the newly computed consumer basket - e.g. rising

consumption during the Christmas season and a sharp rise

in vegetable prices due to the drought in 1996. Consumer

expenditure data of the other 3 rounds of the survey are

being processed and when these data are finalised the new

indices will be expanded and improved further.

Wholesale Price Index

In 1997, the annual increase in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) decelerated to 6.9 percent. This was a mere one third of the increase of 20.5 per cent registered last year. The lower rate of increase of the price of tea and the drop in the price of rubber and coconut, all of which haVe significant weights in the Index, were the major reasons for the deceleration of the WPI. The prices of the three elevational categories of tea which registered increases ranging from 36 to 48 per cent in 1996, rose by 13 to 20 per cent during 1997. The price of coconuts, which rose by 80 per cent last year, registered a marginal decrease of 0.6 per cent while the price of coconut oil fell by 0.8 per cent. Tea and coconut had accounted for over 50 per cent of the

total increase in the WPI last year. In addition to the above, the substantial decline in the price of rubber, whieh was the major cause for the decline in the miscellaneous category, also exerted downward pressure on the overall WPI. Price declines registered in the machinery and paper products categories and the deceleration in the textile and footwear, metal products, transport equipment and fuel and light categories also contributed to the overall picture.

the prices of tea and the drop in the price of coconuts, the

sharp deceleration in the growth of the price of open market

paddy from over 30 per cent in 1996 to around 8 per cent

in 1997, the decline in the import price of wheat grain and

the drop in prices of subsidiary food crops such as chillies

were also responsible for the lower rate of increase in the

prices in the food category.

Price increases in the textile and footwear, metal

products, transport equipment and fuel and light categories

slowed down during the year, registering 1.2 per cent, 2.8

per cent, 3.2 per cent and 11.8 per cent, respectively, as

compared to increases of 8.0 per cent, 11.1 per cent, 7.3 per

cent and 13.1 per cent last year. Prices in the paper products,

machinery and miscellaneous categories registered declines

of J5.1 per cent, 1.4 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively,

as compared with increases of 10.7 per cent, 3.5 per cent

and 10.0 per cent last year.

Prices of alcoholic drinks, chemicals and chemical

products, petroleum products and electrical appliances,

however, accelerated twice as much in 1997 as in the

previous year. Increases in fertiliser prices raised the index

of the chemical group. The full impact of the increase of

petroleum prices in September 1996 was felt in the current

year, while the increase in cement prices contributed to the

rise in the non-metallic products index.

Sectorally, the sub indices for the domestic, import and export groups showed lower increases. The increases in the domestic and import group indices dropped.to 6.5 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively, from 11.7 per cent and 1.1.6 per cent, last year.

decreased substantially to 8.9 per cent and 1.2 per cent from

the 25.4 per cent and 10.3 per cent registered last year.

However, the price increase in the investment category at 5.5

per cent remained close to the previous year's level of 5.6

per cent.

Regional Price Variations

Table 6.6 shows the average retail prices of major food

items in the Colombo, Kandy, Anuradhapura and Matara

markets, and their variations in comparison with the

Colombo market during 1997. A similar pattern of variation

as in 1996 was observed in 1997 too, with relatively lower

variability for items with lower perishability such as rice,

onions, potatoes, dried chillies, eggs and coconuts and high

variability for vegetables and fish. Prices of vegetables were

lower in the regional centres when compared with Colombo

due to their proximity to producing areas, while the prices

of fish, onions and eggs were generally lower in Colombo.

Again, in confonnity with major regional production patterns,

prices of short grain (samba) rice and chillies were lowest

in the Anuradhapura market while the price of kekulu rice

was lowest in the Matara market. Prices of upcountry

vegetables were lowest in the Kandy market while prices of

fish were highest in that market.

Chart 6.4 depicts the seasonal behaviour of prices in

selected markets. The seasonal pattern of price behaviour for

rice was more clearly observed in 1997. than in 1996 as a

consequence of improved domestic production. In the

Anuradhapura market, which is in close proximity to many

rice producing areas, the seasonal pattern appeared to be

relatively sharper with prices dropping in the February-April

(Maha harvest) period and again in August-September (Yala

harvest) period. The seasonal price behaviour for beans was

however less marked in 1997 than in 1996. Prices for this

commodity remained highest in Colombo throughout the

year, while prices in Kandy fell to lower levels in May. The

price of red onions displayed a clear seasonal pattern in all

markets as in the previous year, with prices being low during

February-March and peak prices being recorded in June.

Variations in the price of red onions between Colombo

and both the Anuradhapura and Matara markets narrowed

when compared to last year. Price differences with respect

to eggs also narrowed notably between the Colombo and

Anuradhapura markets. Prices of coconuts in the three

regional markets also moved closer to the Colombo market

with prices in Matara marginally exceeding Colombo prices.

Improved market information on prices of supplies evidently

helped to even out differences.

6.2 Wages

In 1997. the Government took the first step in a major overhaul, of public sector salaries by accepting' the recommendations of the Salaries Review Committee appointed in 1994 with Mr. B.C.Perera as Chairman. This was the first comprehensive review of public sector emoluments in more than 20 years. As a result, all categories of public sector employees (except school teachers who received substantial wage increases in 1995) received significant nominal wage increases (with.promises of further forthcoming adjustments). The real.wages for school teachers improved moderately when compared to the levels of 1996. In the organised private sector, minimum wages applicable to several wages boards were revised upwards. However, on average, real wages in the organised private sector indicated a deterioration. With respect to the unorganised sector,

provisional data reveal that nominal wages increased

significantly for most activities, such as building construction,

paddy, tea and coconut cultivation, leading to an

improvement in real wages.

Public Sector

A major restructuring of public sector salary scales was

made with the implementation of the Salary Review

Committee proposals. The new salary scales entailed a

unification of basic wages and allowances. The revision was

to be implemented in two stages; 40 per cent of the

increase, subject to a minimum of Rs. 325 per month, was

granted from 1 January 1.997 and the rest from 1 January

1998. Subsequently, the second phase of salary increases at

the higher end of the salary structure was deferred until July,

1998. The Committee's recommendations in rationalising

public sector salaries, which had been seriously disturbed by

ad hoc revisions, were aimed at re-establishing the coherence.

These recommendations were also implemented from January

1997.

As a result, the Wage Rate Index for Government Employees increased by 10.8 per cent, significantly higher than the increase of 3.2 per cent in 1996. Given the inflation rate of 9.6 per cent for 1997, this represents an improvement in real wages of at least 1 per cent. This is in sharp contrast to the previous year, when real wages fell by 10.7 per cent. The Nominal Wage Index for Non- Executive Officers increased by 11.3 per cent during the year compared to a 1.0 per cent increase last year. Accordingly, real wages for these employees improved by 1.5 per cent. The Nominal Wage Index for Minor Employees increased by 10.0 per cent, following an increase of 6.1 per cent in 1996. Accordingly, real wages for minor employees increased marginally. Government school teachers, whose salaries had

been stagnant after a substantial salary increase in January

1995, received a modest nominal wage increase of 2.4 per

cent in 1997. The correction of certain anomalies in the

salary scales of government school teachers was under

consideration during the year.

Private Sector

Wages in the organised private sector are monitored

through the Minimum Wage Rate Indices in Wages Boards

trades. In 1997, on average, nominal wages for all workers '

in Wages Boards increased by 5.9 per cent following an

increase of 8.3 per cent .last year. This indicates a further

deterioration of real wages, following last year. Agricultural

wages rose by 7.0 per cent in 1997, compared with 9.3 per

cent in 1996. Within this category, the minimum daily

wage for workers in tea plantations, which was fixed at

Rs.83 in August, 1996 remained unchanged. Wages for

workers in rubber plantations, however, moved up during

the year as a result of the variable cost of living allowance

payable to these workers. In October 1997, daily wages for

this category had reached Rs.83.22. From November

onwards, the daily wages of rubber workers were fixed at

Rs.83 and ceased to move in tandem with the cost of living

index.

Wages of workers in industry and commerce; as measured, by the relevant wage index, rose by 4.1 per cent in 1997, which is comparable with the 4.8 per cent increase recorded in 1996. Nominal wages of workers in services, which had increased by 6.7 per cent last year, remained unchanged during 1997. Minimum wages in the sub sectors of batik, textile, printing, security services, tea export, coconut and glassware manufacturing were revised upwards during 1997.

98

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1997

Informal Sector

According to provisional data, daily wages of

carpenters, masons and unskilled helpers in building

construction activities improved by around 11 per cent during

the year, reflecting a modest improvement in real terms. In

paddy cultivation, nominal wages for major activities

improved by 9 to 18 per cent and consequently real wages

improved for most activities. In tea cultivation, nominal

wages for preparation of land increased by about 14 per cent

while wages for tea plucking increased by 11 per cent. It is

significant that this was achieved in an environment where

minimum wages fixed by the Wages Boards for tea

plantation workers remained unchanged and is a reflection

of the buoyancy of tea prices. In coconut cultivation, wage

increases for major activities ranged from 13 to 19 per cent.

In rubber cultivation, however, daily wages for rubber

tappers improved by only 5 per cent reflecting deteriorating

market prices. In some cases, payment to rubber tappers in

the unorganised sector is tied to the value of latex tapped.

As mentioned elsewhere, given the country's high trade

dependence (70 per cent of GDP) and need to maintain

export competitiveness, there is a growing need to link wage

increases to productivity gains. The widespread practice of

linking wages to inflation indicators introduces an

inflationary bias, which could affect competitiveness,

compelling resort to exchange and monetary policies where

industrial policy should raise productivity. The Government

is working on a charter for labour which is expected to lay

down guidelines on wage norms and labour mobility.

Among the matters that require urgent solutions are -

(a) the need to promote flexibility in employment,

because labour market rigidities discourage

new employment in a background of high

unemployment;

(b) linking wage increases to productivity gains and

flexible wage systems linked to incentives;

(c) moderation of labour laws to give equal protection

to employers and employees;

(d) promotion of an active competition policy.

It is increasingly recognised that labour market reforms to promote competitive conditions is.vital for the success of economic liberalisation and promotion of new employment. Pending a full scale review of the efficiency of labour ' markets, promotion of liberal sub contracting and outsourcing may prove helpful in emancipation of labour markets.
