As in the previous years, the total volume of international reserves has become the largest single asset category amounting to Rs. 127,174 million and accounting for 67.4 per cent of the total assets as at the end of 1998, compared to Rs.l 18,965 million or 64.7 per cent of the total assets at the end of 1997. This was an increase of 6.9 per cent over the previous year. The main contributory factors for this increase were the receipt of privatisation proceeds on account of Air Lanka Ltd. (US dollars 45 million) and Orient Lanka (US dollars 11.5 million) and the sale of foreign exchange by the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) and the government (US dollars 65 million and US dollars 100 million, respectively). The depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee by 9.6 percent during the year also contributed to the increase in assets in rupee terms. The domestic assets of the Central Bank also showed an increase of 6.1 per cent during the year, from Rs.38,134 million as at end of 1997 to Rs.40,465 million as at end of 1998, due to increases in the Treasury bills held by the Bank and the volume of loans and advances (mainly revolving credit facility) granted to the government. Meanwhile, medium and long term credit facilities granted to commercial banks and other credit institutions declined by 33.7 per cent mainly due to repayments and provisions on account of non-performing loans. Short term advances to commercial banks also declined by 34.5 per cent in 1998'.",

During the year under review, three LCBs failed to maintain the capital adequacy standards enforced by the Central Bank which are based on the Basle Capital Accord of the Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices Committee. Of these, two banks have taken corrective action to meet the required capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent while the other LCB failed to reach the minimum standard specified. Proposals submitted by the Bank to restore its capital adequacy ratio are being examined. The minimum level of liquid assets of 20 per cent stipulated in terms of the Banking Act was maintained by all the LCBs and LSBs and ranged between 20 per cent (minimum) and 42 per cent of total liabilities. However a few RRDBs that failed to reach the minimum liquidity level stipulated, were subjected to the payment of a penalty in terms of the Banking Act.",

The ADB allocated originally a sum of US dollars 19 million for the credit component for the provision of refinance to PCIs to enable them to on-lend to small holders and private tea factory owners to undertake activities in new planting and replanting, nursery development and factory development. The funds allocated did not move at the expected rate in the initial few years due to a slack in the demand for loans from tea small holders. This slow progress led to a review of the credit allocation by both the ADB and the government in 1994. Accordingly, a downward revision of the credit component by US dollars 10 million was effected with the concurrence of the government. Since then, the project recorded a gradual improvement in the performance and PCIs were able to meet the total loan target well ahead of the closing date of the Project. However, the total amount could not be fully disbursed as loan disbursements are spread over a number of years. At the time of loan closure in December 1998, a total sum of US dollars 11.83 million or 94 per cent had been utilised out of the revised allocation of US dollars 12.6 million.",

Hence, several groups operating in a village were formed into SFLC Development Societies, (Isuru Sanwardana Samithi), which were registered with the Registrar of Companies as corporate bodies with limited liability under the Societies Ordinance. As at the end of 1998, 160 such limited liability societies had been formed. Action was also taken to form four district federations in the Project Districts of Matara, Galle, Puttalam and Kandy. The members of the federations were elected by the society members from among themselves (three members from each society). The federations were registered under Section 21 of the Company Ordinance as non-governmental organizations.
