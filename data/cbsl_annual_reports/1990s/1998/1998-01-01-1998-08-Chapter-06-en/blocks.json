    "text": "Inflation continued to decline in 1998 owing to a slowing down of growth of money supply, decline in imported inflation and increased availability of imported consumer goods. The slowing down of the rate of monetary expansion, together with higher positive real interest rates, reduced the demand pressure on prices. Meanwhile, a sharp reduction in import prices of many essential commodities such as wheat, crude oil, fertiliser and sugar kept the domestic prices of these items from rising in spite of a larger depreciation of the rupee in 1998. Price increases subsided, particularly during the second half of the year, and the consumer price inflation remained below 6 per cent from August 1998. Food prices continued to remain high, despite a slowing down of the rate of increase in prices towards the latter half of the year. While the aggregate consumer prices increased by 7-9.5 per cent, average food prices increased by 8-10 per cent and contributed to about 80 per cent of the increase in consumer prices in 1998. The rate of increase in food prices had decelerated to around 2-4 per cent by the end of the year, due to improved domestic supplies including the successful paddy harvest both in the Maha and the Yala seasons, as well as the increased availability of imported food items. The tariffs on electricity were revised upwards in September 1997 and the direct and indirect impact of this increase was felt in 1998. Price increases of clothing, footwear, telecommunication and health services have declined considerably due to improved performance of these sectors. The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) raised consumer prices by 2-3 per cent although about 80 per cent of the items in the Colombo Consumers' Price Index basket have been exempted from GST.",

    "text": "All available consumer price indices reflected an easing of inflation in 1998. The Colombo District Consumer Price Index (CDCPI) computed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka indicated an annual average increase of 7.3 per cent in 1998, marginally down from 7.4 per cent in 1997. The Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), the official measure of the cost of living computed by the Department of Census and Statistics, recorded an annual average increase of 9.4 per cent which was also slightly lower than the 9.6 per cent increase recorded by this index in 1997. The Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index (GCPI), which is an alternative consumer price index also computed by the Department of Census and Statistics, indicated an increase of 6.9 per cent in 1998, again slightly below the 7.1 per cent increase registered by the same index in 1997. Meanwhile, at the primary market level, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) increased by 6.1 per cent in 1998 as compared with an increase of 6.9 per cent in 1997.",

    "text": "The normal seasonal pattern of price behaviour was observed in 1998 with the price level declining according to all consumer price indices during the February- March period, which corresponds to the Maha harvesting period, and the July - September period, which corresponds to the Yala harvesting period. It is notable that in the first half of the year, all indices pointed to a slight acceleration of inflation when compared with the first half of 1997. As at June 1998, the point to point increase of the CCPI (June 1998 over June 1997) was 14.1 per cent, while the corresponding increases registered by the CDCPI and GCPI were 9.5 per cent and 10.1 per cent, respectively. However, the inflationary situation turned more favourable in the second half of the year, with the overall rate of inflation at end 1998 being in fact slightly below that of 1997. As at December, the point to point increase of the CCPI (December 1998 over December 1997) dropped to 3.7 per cent while the corresponding figures for the CDCPI and GCPI declined to 4.0 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively. On the demand front, the slowing down of the growth of real income under depressed world market conditions, containment of the growth of money supply to around 13 per cent, compared with 14.9 per cent in 1997, and higher positive real interest rates, contributed to an easing of demand pressure on prices.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka is yet to achieve a sustainable reduction of inflation. Although the average consumer price inflation has declined, according to the CCPI, to 10.2 per cent during the last five years from 13.5 per cent during the five years 1989-93, | a steady reduction of the inflation rate to below 5 per cent would be required for the country to disentangle itself from the inbuilt inflationary bias. Sri Lanka's inflation rate has been higher than the average inflation rate of her trading partners and competitors. This has forced the exchange rate to depreciate at a rate of about 5-6 per cent per year for Sri Lanka to remain competitive in the world commodity markets. As mentioned in the 1997 Annual Report, the exchange rate depreciation has a feedback effect on inflation as Sri Lanka is a highly trade dependent economy where exports and imports together account for about 70 per cent of GDP. The internal wage setting mechanism, which links many wages directly or indirectly to inflation rather than to labour productivity, has been another channel in this inflation-wage-exchange rate nexus. These, together with continuing high budget deficits, have made it a challenging task to eliminate high inflationary expectations among the public. Hence, measures have to be in place for a sustainable reduction in inflation by containing the fiscal deficit at below 5 per cent and introducing a productivity based wage setting mechanism. These have to be supplemented with other measures to eliminate structural weaknesses in the labour market - measures which would make the labour market more flexible, while providing equal protection to both workers and employers in a competitive environment.",

In 1997, the increase in prices in the food category was lower at 7.3 per cent. The price of wheat flour, which was revised upward in August 1997 remained at that level throughout 1998. The increase in the price of rice, the staple food, was slight during the year with prices of some varieties actually declining, due to the increase in paddy production by about 20 per cent when compared to last year. The contribution of rice to the overall increase of the CDCPI was only 1 per cent, while the contribution of bread and wheat flour was just below 5 per cent. In contrast, prices of most varieties of vegetables increased sharply during the first half of the year. Heavy rains in the closing two months of 1997, the very warm weather conditions in March/April and the windy conditions in the Nuwara-Eliya area which came earlier than usual, adversely affected the production of vegetables. In the second half of the year, however, vegetable prices declined due to improved supplies. Vegetables are estimated to have contributed to around 13 per cent of the overall increase of the CDCPI during the year.",

In the food group, the open market producer price of paddy dropped by around 6 per cent due to enhanced production during the year. The CIF prices of imported rice and wheat grain also declined due to lower international commodity prices. Meanwhile, prices of both mid-grown and low grown tea registered lower increases of 13 per cent and 10 per cent as compared with increases of 20 per cent and 13 per cent last year. These developments were the main contributory factors for the deceleration in food prices in the Wholesale Price Index.

Prices of beans displayed a sharper seasonal behaviour in 1998 than in 1997 in all markets, with prices declining from relatively high levels in January to low levels in March - April and thereafter increasing sharply again to reach a peak level in June. Prices dropped thereafter and were relatively low in the second half of the year. This pattern of price behaviour was observed in the case of most vegetables. Prices of beans in Colombo were found to be notably higher than those prevailing in the regional markets throughout the year. Prices of red onions displayed a clear seasonal pattern as in the previous year. However, due to the lower production, prices did not plummet to such low levels as in 1997 during the glut season. It is also notable that prices of red onions in the Kandy market exceeded those in the Colombo market during most of the year. Prices of potatoes also indicated less seasonality than in 1997 due to lower production and the availability of imports throughout the year.",

The growth in overall wages in the organised private sector was sharper than in 1997. Real wages of workers in agriculture, industry and commerce improved. In the informal sector, wages increased in nominal terms in most major activities. Significant real wage improvements were registered in major activities in paddy, tea and coconut cultivation.

Wages in the minor employee category increased at a slower rate of 6.5 per cent representing a real wage deterioration of 2.7 per cent. In the previous year, although the increase in the nominal wages of this category was 10.0 per cent, their real wage improved only by 0.2 per cent.

Under this agreemenL the daily wages of adult workers were increased from Rs.83 to Rs.95. In the case of workers in the tea sector, an additional price share supplement of Rs.6 per day also became payable. This payment is, however, subject to review at the end of 18 months or earlier if there is a serious down\u00adturn in tea prices. For workers in the rubber sector, a price share supplement is also payable on a fluctuating basis at the rate of 30 cents for each one rupee increase in the price of rubber (RSS No.l), over the threshold price of Rs.65. These price share supplements, however, do not attract Employees' Provident Fund or Employees' Trust Fund benefits.

Wages for skilled helpers in carpentry and masonry increased by 9 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, wages for unskilled helpers in building construction registered increases of between 7 and 8 per cent. In paddy cultivation, wages for different major activities registered increases ranging from 9 to 15 per cent. Real wages were reported to have improved for workers engaged in ploughing, broadcasting, spraying, weeding, harvesting and threshing. In small scale tea plantations, wages for major activities improved significantly, reflecting both the impact of the increase in minimum wage rates applicable to the tea sector and the buoyant tea prices. Daily wages for preparation of land and for female pluckers increased by 10 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively. In contrast, in rubber smallholdings, wages for tapping declined slightly in nominal terms reflecting the deterioration in rubber prices (in some cases, payment for tapping is tied to the value of latex tapped). Reflecting the improvement in coconut prices, wages in activities in coconut cultivation improved substantially with wages for digging of pits increasing by 13 per cent and wages for plucking~.(with sticks) increasing by over 20 per cent. Accordingly, real wages improved substantially for workers engaged in these activities in coconut cultivation.",
