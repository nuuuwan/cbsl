The GDP growth, though lower in comparison to 6.3 per cent recorded in 1997, was achieved in the midst of unfavourable global economic conditions, which emerged after the East Asian crisis. Most of Sri Lanka's major exports were affected by the global recession and competition from East Asian countries. However, at the same time, there were gains from price advantages on imported inputs to the manufacturing and construction sectors. Overall, domestic demand remained strong, supported by a growth in investment in both the private and public sectors and a rise in consumer expenditure. This helped to mitigate the negative impact of the weak external demand.",

This slightly lower rate of growth in GNP, compared to that of GDP, is due to deterioration in the net factor income from abroad (NFIA). This was caused by a decline in foreign investment income and higher outflows in the form of profits and dividends. In contrast to an increase in net foreign investment income by US dollars 37 million between 1996 and 1997, there was a net increase in these outflows by US dollars 19 million between 1997 and 1998. The slow growth in investment income receipts in 1998 was due to the lower international interest rates. Meanwhile, the larger outflow of income remitted abroad was in consonance with the continuous growth in FDI during the period 1996 - 1998.",

In the World Bank classification of countries according to per capita income, Sri Lanka is now in the 'lower middle income' country group whose per capita income falls within the range US dollars 795 - US dollars 3,125. The country's economic growth rate has to be about 8 per cent for it to become an 'upper middle income' country within the next ten years. Even if Sri Lanka is to maintain a steady growth rate of 6-7 per cent, its domestic investment will have to be raised at least to 30 per cent of GDP, assuming a significant increase in productivity. In view of the recent slowing down of the economic growth and poor prospects for the world economy, achieving a steady growth of this magnitude does not appear to be feasible. Given Sri Lanka's rising per capita income, it is unlikely that it will be able to find concessional foreign aid to meet all of its foreign resource requirements, particularly in an environment where concessional aid to developing countries is declining.

This was in contrast to the growth pattern observed in recent years where the impetus to growth was from export oriented industries. The textile and apparel sub-sector, which plays a significant role in the export earnings of the economy as well as employment generation, faced strong competition as there was a large contraction in the growth of world trade. The contribution of the textiles, apparel and leather goods sub-sector to the growth in real output of factory industries was only 24 per cent in 1998 compared to 69 per cent in 1997 due to the considerable slowing down in export growth of products in this sub-sector. A series of policy measures introduced in budgets in the recent past, including fiscal incentives to encourage the use of advanced technology in manufacturing, has led to an expansion in the capacity of industrial production and a more diversified industrial base. The investments in advanced technologies in several industrial sectors have improved productivity, enabling those sectors to offset a modest acceleration of wages and salaries.",

Growth in the paddy sector is attributed mainly to the increase in the land area brought under paddy cultivation on account of a plentiful supply of water a higher yield rate from increased fertiliser application and favourable weather conditions compared to 1997. The output in the fisheries sub-sector expanded owing to the resumption of fishing in the Eastern coastal belt and growth in production in aquaculture mostly shrimp farming. These developments also led to a noteworthy increase in export earnings from fisheries products. The 'other' agriculture sector displayed a mixed performance, with animal husbandry and vegetables displaying a better performance than in the previous year, while the output in subsidiary food crops is estimated to have declined due to competition from imports. In plantation agriculture, tea production continued to increase.

    "text": "factory industry in 1998 was attributed to the production expansion in the categories of food, beverages and tobacco, textiles, apparel and leather goods and chemicals, petroleum, plastic and rubber products. Growth in the food, beverages and tobacco sub sector increased to 9.6 per cent from 3.4 per cent in 1997 due to an increase in domestic demand, mainly for processed cereal food, processed meat products and beverages. The output of the chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic goods sub sector grew by 13.1 per cent, mainly due to an increase in the output of petroleum products. In 1998, production at the petroleum refinery continued throughout the year, whereas in the previous year it had been closed for two months for routine maintenance. The expansion in construction activity stimulating the demand for PVC pipes and accessories, paints and chemicals, while the growth in demand for plastic and polythene products, mainly from the garment industry, also contributed to the growth of this sub sector. A considerable deceleration in the growth rate of the textiles, apparel and leather goods sub sector was due to unfavourable external factors, stemming from the East Asian financial crisis. An increase in the production of building materials, mainly cement, roofing materials and ceramic tiles, led to a higher rate of growth in the non-metallic mineral products category. The processing industry was affected by the setback in rubber and coconut production.",

However, the trade sector, which includes import, export and domestic trade, recorded a lower growth rate of 4.5 per cent in 1998 when compared to 6.3 per cent in 1997.

The import trade sub sector, which is responsible for about 42 per cent of the sector's value added, grew by 8.2 per cent in real terms in 1998 when compared to 9.6 per cent in 1997. This was mainly due to the decline in imports of rice (42 per cent), sugar (29.6 per cent), fish products (7 per cent) and intermediate goods such as fertiliser (6.5 per cent), petroleum products (36.1 per cent) and wheat (8 per cent).

In the food and beverages category, consumption expenditure on imported milk products, pulses and fruits has displayed a significant increase, while consumption of imported rice and fish products declined as their domestic production increased significantly. The increase in domestically produced goods and services contributed to almost 67 per cent of the overall increase in Private Consumption Expenditure in 1998.

About 86 per cent of this increase of Rs.44 billion was contributed by increased domestic savings. The domestic savings ratio rose significantly from 17 per cent to 19 per cent of GDP. Net private transfers, which are the main source of foreign income, are estimated to have increased by 17.9 per cent to Rs.55 billion in 1998. Accordingly, the national savings ratio increased from 21.5 per cent in 1997 to 23.2 per cent in 1998. It would thus appear that the savings of Sri Lankans earning abroad account for 4 percentage points of GDP. As the world wide recessionary conditions and weakness of commodity prices could affect prospects for foreign employment, continued efforts need to be made to raise domestic savings.",

The 1998 annual GDP estimates are also compiled at 1996 base year prices. However, the aggregate value of the quarterly estimates and the value of annual estimates may not necessarily be equal. This is because the compilation of quarterly estimates is based on short-term statistical indicators such as production, sales, export and import statistics. Some data used for the annual estimates, for example accounting data, are not available more frequently. In some sectors, the statistical systems, though geared to provide annual data, have been slow to adjust their systems to compile reliable statistics on a quarterly basis. However it should be noted that improvements in statistical data collection systems arc usually obtained with practice and regular collection of data.

According to the IMF requirements, countries which are planning to enter the international capital markets to meet their resource requirements arc required to subscribe to the SDDS under which the dissemination of quarterly GDP estimates is one of the requirements. One of the main reasons for the introduction of GDDS and SDDS was the Mexican crisis, which was mainly attributed to the lack of transparency due to poor information.
