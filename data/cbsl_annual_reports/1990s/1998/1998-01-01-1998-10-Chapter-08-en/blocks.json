This was an ambitious target considering the high degree of uncertainty that prevailed in late 1997 about the prospects for the world economy, domestic security expenditures and revenue implications of the impending Goods and Services Tax (GST). The reduction of the fiscal deficit was to be achieved through better financial control, enhancing revenue buoyancy, containment of the growth of current expenditures, further progress in public enterprise reforms with private sector participation and the strengthening of debt management. The 1998 Budget also envisaged an increase in public investment to 6.9 per cent of GDP, as inadequate infrastructure facilities were emerging as a constraint for faster economic growth.",

While a slippage could not have been avoided in 1998 owing to revenue and other implications of the slowing down of the economy as a result of the crisis in the global economy, the magnitude of the slippage was worrisome. It thwarted the objective of easing the high interest rates to promote investment and employment. In fact, during the year, interest rates on government debt instruments and the prime lending rate started rising, reflecting the increased domestic resource needs of the government for deficit financing. A further relaxation of monetary policy to dampen the increase in interest rates was not possible, as this would have had adverse implications on price stability and the exchange market. Given these developments and the weaker prospects for economic growth, the target of 6 per cent of GDP for the overall deficit in 1999 as expected in the 1999 Budget appears difficult to achieve. Early measures may have to be taken to contain the budget deficit at a realistic level of around 7.5 per cent of GDP in 1999.",

Higher expenditures on non-security related salaries and wages and transfers to loss making public sector entities (Sri Lanka Railways and the Postal Department) also contributed 7 per cent. The inflationary pressures of the enlarged budget deficit were not clearly seen in 1998 as the country benefited from the sharp reduction in import prices, particularly for crude oil, wheat grain, fertiliser and sugar, under depressed world market conditions. These price reductions helped to contain the growth in the import bill, despite a 9.6 per cent depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar, thus leaving more resources with the banking system. It appears that the resources thus freed by these reductions and the relatively slow growth of private sector credit enabled the banking system to finance a large portion of the enlarged budget deficit without exerting excessive pressure on interest rates.",

The move towards lower rates of taxation was expected to raise savings and private investment. The major structural change made in the tax system was the introduction of the GST with effect from 1 April 1998 to eliminate the cascading effect of the turnover tax and to operate on the destination principle, where all exports are zero rated, while domestic consumption is subject to taxation. Initially, unprocessed agricultural products, public transport, fertiliser, cement, pharmaceuticals and some essential food items were exempted. Imports for the processing of exports, which were exempted under turnover tax by a laborious administrative action, were brought under the GST system with a refunding mechanism. Importers of such goods are entitled to a deferment facility of 45 days to settle their tax liabilities (this period was later increased to 60 days). The banking and financial services sector continued to be under turnover tax, but the tax rate applicable was further reduced from 2 per cent to 1 per cent with a view to reducing the cost of funds. Initially, a single GST rate of 12.5 per cent was applied. Although this rate yield was less than the former turnover tax system, it was considered prudent to start with a lower rate in order to achieve greater public acceptance.",

The current account deficit increased to 2.4 per cent from 2.2 per cent of GDP in 1997. Meanwhile, increased capital expenditure and net lending also added 1.1",

The shortfall in revenue was entirely the outcome of a sharp reduction in tax revenues, from 16 per cent of GDP in 1997 to 14.5 per cent of GDP in 1998. The GST failed to generate sufficient revenue owing to a less than revenue neutral tax rate, transitional problems and a large number of exemptions. Numerous tax exemptions and concessions granted in lieu of income taxes contributed to some erosion of the income tax base. Import tax revenue declined, mainly as a result of exemptions and concessions and a reduction in import values, reflecting the decline in prices of Sri Lanka's major import commodities. Non-tax revenue registered a marked increase of 23 per cent owing to additional profit transfers from public enterprises, increased rent payments from plantation companies and the timely collection of other non-tax revenue such as interest, levies and dividends.",

This was a significant increase compared with a decline during the last two years to 5.9 per cent of GDP. The maintenance of public investment at a higher level was possible due to increased utilisation of foreign aid during 1998. While gross foreign aid disbursements increased by Rs.6,590 million in 1998, the aid utilisation rate increased from 79 per cent to 82 per cent. In the past, the public investment programme slowed down mainly due to resource constraints. However, as the government was committed to maintaining the investment programme, unlike in the past, the required rupee resources were released and this was reflected in a 41 per cent increase in rupee funds in 1998, compared with 11 per cent in 1997. Capital expenditure was mainly concentrated in key areas such as energy, transport, telecommunication, port and water supply and drainage. Investment in these",

The decline was entirely due to a drop in tax buoyancy. Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP declined further to 14.5 per cent of GDP in 1998, reflecting mainly the deterioration of the revenue base. Correspondingly, the share of non-tax revenue rose from 2.1 per cent of GDP in 1996 to 2.7 per cent of GDP in 1998. The emerging trends in government revenue clearly highlight the compelling need for an improvement of the tax base and strengthening of tax administration.

This new consumption tax, introduced with a standard rate of 12.5 per cent, is levied on the incremental value added at every stage in the production and distribution of goods and services. Although the GST replaced the turnover tax, financial services in the non-manufacturing sector continued to be under the turnover tax system. The implementation of the GST was also accompanied by revisions to excise taxes with a view to maintaining revenue neutrality. However, a marked shortfall in GST collections (by Rs.7,787 million compared with the expected target for the year) resulted in a lacklustre performance of this tax in 1998. Total revenues from the turnover tax and GST at Rs.39,343 million recorded a 9 per cent drop in 1998 as compared to a 16 per cent growth observed in TT collections in 1997.",

    "text": "1998. Moreover, the provision of input credit facilities for service inputs in the manufacturing sector also contributed towards this decline. Meanwhile, in the non-manufacturing sector, TT/GST revenue declined by 5 per cent in 1998 as compared with a substantial growth of 37 per cent in 1997. The exclusion of certain service sectors from the GST, such as shipping, airlines and a major segment of the services rendered by the Ports Authority and Airport and Aviation Services, together with the input tax credit facility newly introduced under the GST can be cited as the major reasons for the decrease in this revenue source. Moreover, the full impact of the reduction of the turnover tax rate from 2 per cent in 1997 to 1 per cent in 1998 on financial activities was felt in 1998, thus contributing to the lower collection from the non-manufacturing sector. Revenue from GST/TT on imports amounted to Rs.25,358 million, while refunds on account of imported inputs totalled Rs.7,826 million. Accordingly, the net revenue collection on account of GST on imports at Rs. 17.532 million registered a drop of 15 per cent in comparison to an increase of 9 per cent observed in the import turnover tax revenue collection in 1997. The abolition of the 10 per cent mark up margin (which was 25 per cent before November 1997) for the computation of the import tax base under the GST system, together with the increase in exemptions, have lowered the effective GST base. Possible irregularities in the refund process and the increase in the deferment period from 45 days to 60 days on the request of exporters may have also contributed",

As a share of total tax revenue, excise taxes increased from 17.4 per cent in 1997 to 20.5 per cent in 1998. Revenue from cigarette excise taxes, however, recorded a lower increase of 6 per cent in 1998 in comparison to 10 per cent in 1997. This was mainly due to two reasons. First, it reflects the impact of downward adjustments in excise tax rates on cigarettes to maintain revenue and price neutrality with the implementation of the GST. Accordingly, the shift in tax collection from excise to GST is estimated to be about Rs.l, 100 million. Second, price increases on cigarettes in July and November 1998 (the overall price increase was 22-25 per cent) adversely affected the growth in sales. Sales of cigarettes, which grew by 5 per cent during the first half of the year, dropped to less than 1 per cent during the second half of 1998. In contrast, the excise tax revenue mobilised through liquor rose by 24 per cent in 1998, compared to a 6 per cent growth in 1997. This was the combined outcome of the upward revision of the excise tax on hard liquor under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act from 12.75 per cent to 20.20 per cent in April, a further increase of the excise tax by 10 per cent on all varieties of hard liquor and the introduction of an excise tax on malt liquor on a strength basis from November 1998. Moreover, the increase in the production of all hard liquor varieties and malt liquor helped to increase liquor excise revenues. The production of hard liquor increased by 12 per cent, while the production of malt liquor increased substantially by 45 per cent with the commissioning of two beer factories with an annual production capacity of 28 million bulk litres in 1998. Revenue collection under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, excluding cigarettes and liquor, recorded a significant increase (70 per cent) in 1998. The excise tax on petrol, one of the major revenue sources under this category, was increased from 25 per cent to 50 per cent in April 1998 to offset the revenue losses arising from the exemption of petrol from the GST. This revision, combined with a 4 per cent increase in petrol sales, has resulted in a revenue shift of about Rs. 1,500 million from the GST to excise taxes. An additional excise duty of 10 per cent levied on all imported private vehicles from November 1998 also contributed towards the increase in revenue under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act.",

The average duty rate, i.e., the ratio of total import duty to total value of imports, dropped marginally to 7.4 per cent in 1998 from 7.7 per cent in 1997. The slow growth in import duty collections can largely be attributed to the removal of import duties on yarn, fabric, intermediate and capital goods for the textile industry and the grant of similar concessions to assist priority sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, industry, telecommunication, computer software manufacturing and tourism. The new duty exemptions limited the growth of dutiable imports to 5 per cent in 1998. Consequently, the share of dutiable imports to total imports declined to 35 per cent in 1998 from 37 per cent in 1997, while the average effective duty rate remained unchanged at 20.9 per cent in 1998. Moreover, the rationalisation of the tariff structure, which brought about a downward revision of the tariff rates from 10, 20 and 35 per cent in 1994 to 5,10 and 30 per cent in November 1998, together with the lower international prices for Sri Lanka's major dutiable imports in 1998, also contributed towards the slow growth in import duty collections.",

    "text": "The revenue from income taxes at Rs.20,429 million showed a 5 per cent decrease in 1998 owing to a marginal reduction in non-corporate income taxes to Rs.8,099 million and a 10 per cent decline in corporate income taxes to Rs.l 1,788 million. Collections from the Save the Nation Contribution grew from Rs.327 million to Rs.542 million. Income taxes as a percentage of tax revenue declined to 13.8 per cent in 1998 from 15.1 per cent in 1997, while as a percentage of GDP, income tax revenue dropped from 2.4 per cent in 1997 to 2 per cent in 1998. The unification of the tax threshold at Rs. 144,000 for all tax payers, the widening of tax slabs to Rs. 100,000 and the decrease in the withholding tax rate on interest income from 15 per cent to 10 per cent in 1997, contributed to the decline in the collection from personal income taxes. Corporate income taxes showed a decline of 11 per cent in 1998. Reduction of the corporate tax rate on priority sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, livestock and tourism to 15 per cent, investment tax allowances granted for manufacturing enterprises and tax incentives granted to develop thrust industries under BOI facilities, software industries and for regional industrialisation can be identified as major reasons for the declining trend in the corporate income tax collection.",

Its share in total revenue rose to 16 per cent as compared to 14 per cent and 11 per cent in 1997 and 1996, respectively. As a percentage of GDP, non-tax revenue at 2.7 per cent in 1998, was marginally higher than in 1997. This growth in the non-tax revenues offset, to some extent, the shortfall in the tax revenue. Property income, which accounts for 67 per cent of total non-tax revenue, rose by 23 per cent mainly due to higher interest receipts, rent, profits and dividends collected from public enterprises. Interest receipts at Rs.7,786 million were higher than the estimate of Rs.7,108 million in 1998, due to the collection of arrears and the strict enforcement of time limits on payments due from public enterprises such as the Ceylon Electricity Board (Rs.3,069 million) and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (Rs.727 million). Central Bank profit transfers increased from Rs.l,500 million in 1997 to Rs.2,650 million in 1998. The increase from this source of revenue offset the revenue loss arising from the abolition of the withholding tax on Treasury bills held by the Central Bank. Profits, dividends and levies, excluding Central Bank profit transfers, increased from Rs.4,284 million in 1997 to Rs.6,190 million in 1998, an increase of 44 per cent. Major contributors were the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (Rs.2,350 million), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (Rs.500 million) and Air Lanka Ltd. (Rs.632 million). Meanwhile, a levy of Rs. 1,000 million was collected from Bank of Ceylon under the Finance Act. The government also recovered Rs.658 million from the Bank of Ceylon and Rs.572 million from the People's Bank out of interest payments made on account of restructuring bonds to these two banks. Receipts from rent income increased by 66 per cent to Rs.1,410 million, mainly due to rent collected from privatised plantation companies. Revenue collected from other non-tax sources, such as fees and charges, social security contributions and non-industrial sales, also recorded a considerable increase of 23 per cent totalling Rs.9,202 million in 1998. These sources contributed to the increase in non-tax revenue in 1998.",

Interest payments on government debt decreased marginally to Rs.54,897 million, owing to lower interest payments on domestic debt. This was a result of lower interest rates in 1997. Domestic interest payments, as a ratio of end year total domestic debt, declined to 11 per cent from 12.7 per cent in 1997. An improvement in debt management, particularly the popularising of government securities as risk free savings instruments among the people, could help to reduce interest costs further. The importance of reducing the fiscal deficit needs to be re-emphasised in this regard.",

While transfers to corporations reflected an increase of 10 per cent during the year, transfer payments to public institutions increased by 63 per cent to Rs.4,320 million in 1998. The increase in transfer payments can largely be attributed to the accommodation of the new salary structure in these institutions. However, the reclassification of a major portion of Mahaweli Authority transfers to current from capital was also responsible for the increase in such expenditures to public institutions. Meanwhile, payments made to settle pension, EPF and ETF arrears at the Sri Lanka Central Transport Board (SLCTB) also contributed towards the increase in transfers to corporations (excluding Sri Lanka Railway and Postal Department), which rose from Rs.726 million in 1997 to Rs.1,324 million in 1998. A sharp reduction in wheat grain prices in the international market, to an annual average of US dollars 143 per metric ton (cif) in 1998 from US dollars 175 per metric ton in 1997, helped the government to completely phase out the flour subsidy in 1998, thus moderating the increase in transfers to corporations. Transfer payments to local governments also rose by 2 per cent to Rs. 1,977 million owing to higher salaries and wages.",

The remaining 14 per cent stake, amounting to US dollars 25 million, is to be transferred before end December 2000.

Among the 21 privatised plantation companies, 13 were listed on the CSE with public offers of 20 per cent of the issued share capital. The market capitalisation of the 13 listed plantations amounted to Rs.5,061 million and accounted for about 4 per cent of the CSE's market capitalisation in 1998.

Net domestic financing of the deficit increased by Rs.41,087 million to Rs.71,362 million in 1998 in contrast to a decline of Rs. 19,480 million witnessed in the previous year. Accordingly, net domestic financing as a percentage of GDP witnessed a substantial rise from 3.4 per cent in 1997 to 7 per cent in 1998. While net borrowings through domestic sources consisted of Rs.52,408 million from non-bank sources, bank borrowings amounted to Rs. 18,954 million.

Gross borrowings from non-bank domestic sources amounted to Rs.94,954 million in 1998 in comparison to Rs.57,048 million in 1997. Rupee loans, Treasury bonds and Treasury bills continued to be the major instruments of resource mobilisation from domestic non-bank sources in 1998. The market orientation of medium-term debt was further enhanced with the mobilisation of Rs.34,509 million through Treasury bonds in 1998 as compared to a sum of Rs.8,224 million in 1997. While the coupon rates on 2, 3 and 4 year maturities of Treasury bonds were fixed at 11.0, 11.5 and 12.0 per cent, respectively, the weighted average yield rates for these securities hovered in a range of 10.81 - 13.94 per cent, 12.44 - 13.93 per cent and 12.93 - 13.94 per cent, respectively, during the year. A considerable deviation between the coupon rate and the weighted average yield resulted in a cash shortfall of Rs.l,156 million during 1998. Major subscribers to the Treasury bond programme continued to be the institutional investors, with the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and saving institutions investing Rs.8,812 million and Rs.8,763 million, respectively, in 1998. Reflecting the increased popularity of this instrument, subscriptions to Treasury bonds by other non-bank investors in the private sector amounted to Rs.17,320 million in comparison to Rs.3,503 million in 1997.",

As in the previous year, the principle subscriber to the Rupee loan programme was the EPF with a gross investment of Rs. 38,672 million in 1998.
