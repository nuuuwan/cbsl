    "text": "Sri Lanka's economic performance in 1998 has to be assessed in the context of a highly unstable external environment where the entire world economy was experiencing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression in the early 1930s. World financial markets and exchange rates had been experiencing tremendous instability since mid 1997. The East Asian financial market turmoil had immediate contagion effects and more lasting adverse repercussions on the world economy, particularly the financial and commodity markets. The subsequent eruption of a payment and currency crisis in Russia and the economic problems in South Africa, Brazil and several Latin American countries intensified the instability. In addition, there were concerns about the stability of some leading international banks and global investment funds due to their large exposure to countries in financial distress. Meanwhile, the Japanese economy continued to struggle with serious financial problems. Such worldwide financial and economic distress strained the resources of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other institutions with global responsibilities to promote orderly international trade and payments. The crisis also spotlighted the vulnerability of financial systems in many countries, related to weaknesses in corporate governance, regulatory frameworks and",

    "text": "supervisory standards, excessive government involvement in running financial and business enterprises, inadequate timely information and political instability. Many financial institutions in crisis countries had to be closed down or restructured with public funds. Globally, financial flows to developing countries slowed down significantly and financial policies were tightened, initially raising interest rates to stabilise exchange rates. There was also continuous speculation on whether China would be compelled to devalue its currency to regain competitiveness, which could threaten the post crisis recovery in many Asian countries. Most crisis ridden countries adopted painful but necessary adjustment measures, which have tended to restore international confidence. Altogether, the growth of the world economy fell by nearly half, from 4.3 per cent in 1997 to 2.5 per cent in 1998, leading to a 70 per cent contraction of the growth of world trade. Non-debt creating capital flows to developing countries declined by over 20 per cent in 1997, with other capital flows also declining sharply. With this instability in world commodity and financial markets, exchange rate movements became highly volatile, particularly among key currencies, which made the task of managing the exchange rate and monetary policy of relatively more open and small economies like Sri Lanka a most challenging task. Survival in a sea of turbulence became an achievement and the Sri",

In view of the recent slowing down of the economic growth and poor prospects for the world economy, achieving this is not feasible. Even if Sri Lanka remains in the 'lower middle income' category for some more time, it is unlikely that it will be able to find concessional foreign aid to meet all of its foreign resource requirements for development projects, particularly in an environment where foreign aid to developing countries has been declining. A gradual increase in economic growth to about 7 per cent per year may be possible if the domestic investment ratio is raised to about 30 per cent early. Although the recent increase in the savings rate is a welcome development, raising the domestic savings rate to 30 per cent of GDP or more within the next three years may not be possible, unless budgetary savings are raised through a surplus in the current account. Given this limitation, some amount of foreign",

The International Natural Rubber Price Stabilisation arrangement could not arrest the price decline and the International Natural Rubber Treaty was in disarray due to financing problems.

The new investments were largely in infrastructure projects and capacity expansion in manufacturing industries. There has been a gradual increase in private investment during the last four years, but this was not sufficient to raise Sri Lanka's potential growth significantly.",

According to the Quarterly Labour Force Surveys of the Department of Census and Statistics, it has fallen from 16 per cent of the labour force in early 1990 to 9.1 per cent by the third quarter of 1998. However, the past data on unemployment and the recent data are not strictly comparable, as the coverage has now been improved to include unpaid family workers as employed. If unpaid family workers were excluded, the unemployment rate would be about 10.3 per cent, which still confirms a declining trend in unemployment. Manufacturing, construction, trade, hotels, insurance, real estate and personal services were key areas of employment generation. The BOI firms, along with 137 new projects commencing operations in 1998, generated direct employment for nearly 36,000 persons, a considerable increase compared to 16,000 in 1997. New employment provided by the public sector was estimated at about 19,000. The manufacturing sector is estimated to have generated around 27,000 new employment opportunities at the end of the third quarter of 1998 compared to the third quarter of 1997. The construction sector, which has been growing at a faster rate than in 1997, had also generated about 5,400 new employment opportunities. The employment in the",

The target in the 1998 Budget was to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 6.5 per cent of GDP while generating a surplus in the current account. However, slow growth of tax revenues and large expenditure overruns, particularly in the area of defence, led to larger current account and overall fiscal deficits. The current account deficit increased to 2.4 per cent of GDP in 1998 from 2.2 per cent in 1997, while the overall deficit (before grants and excluding privatisation proceeds) rose to 9.2 per cent from 7.9 per cent in 1997.

    "text": "The revenue buoyancy of the tax system continued to erode in 1998 largely owing to numerous tax exemptions and concessions that have been granted to promote private investment. In addition, the GST did not generate the expected revenue owing to transitional problems. Further, the rate of 12.5 per cent was below the estimated revenue neutral rate (vis a vis the turnover tax which it replaced) of about 17 per cent. Tax collections as a ratio of GDP declined to 14.5 per cent in 1998 from 16 per cent in 1997. Import tax revenue declined, mainly as a result of exemptions and concessions and a reduction in import values, reflecting a decline in the prices of Sri Lanka's major imports. The effect of the slow growth of tax revenues was partly offset by a marked increase of non-tax revenues in the form of additional profit transfers from public enterprises, increased rent payments from plantation companies and the timely collection of other non-tax revenue such as interest, levies and dividends. Total revenue declined to 17.3 per cent of GDP in 1998 from 18.5 per cent in 1997. This shortfall accounted for 44 per cent of the increase in the actual deficit, from the budgeted deficit.",

However, owing to revenue considerations, the proposal was not implemented in 1998. Instead, income tax concessions were granted to selected priority sectors. Accordingly, the corporate tax rate for enterprises in agriculture, fisheries, livestock and tourism was reduced to 15 per cent. Several changes were also made to the excise taxes, including the raising of taxes on liquor by 10 per cent and on petrol from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. Stamp duty on repurchase agreements, pro-notes, bills of exchange, mortgage backed securities and mortgage bonds on lease agreements were substantially reduced in 1998 with a view to lowering the cost of financial market transactions and improving the secondary market for government securities.",

With the surrender of sovereignty in monetary and exchange rate policies to the ECB, which appears to have compelled the United Kingdom to opt out voluntarily from adopting the single currency, the only instrument available for member countries to influence the economy is the fiscal policy, which, in turn, is governed by the convergence criteria. However, achieving the appropriate policy mix at the Euroland level would be a challenging task, because policies that are necessary to deal with structural problems at national level would have implications on the conduct of a single monetary policy and the euro exchange rate. Most of the member countries of the euro region are beset by structural problems with considerable regulation. The mobility of labour is restricted, national labour markets are very rigid and there is very high unemployment in some member countries. The future strength and stability of European Monetary Union depends on the continued commitment to sustained macro economic convergence of member countries, the pace of structural reforms, and the political cohesion among euro members on key policy issues. However, the European Council, consisting of the Heads of State or Government and the President of the European Commission, has well recognised the need for this enhanced policy co-ordination.",

Moreover, the increasing competitive pressures within the euro region, would eliminate hitherto existing geographical advantages, paving the way for increased market integration. The convergence in macro-economic variables within the euro region, in particular the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) having been empowered with a mandate to maintain price stability as a priority (defined as an annual inflation rate of less than two percent) would have favourable spill over effects on the rest of the world. While the impact of the euro in reducing global interest rates would be beneficial for net capital importing countries such as Sri Lanka, the potential growth prospects for euro region economies would induce higher foreign direct investments and international trade vis-a-vis developing countries such as ours.",

Rice prices, on the other hand, increased sharply during the year in response to rice stocks falling to a 25 year low. The drop in world rice production is mainly a result of lower production in China and India which account for over a half of the world rice production and for a quarter of world rice exports.

The reform efforts to address frttancial sector issues in domestic economies helped build investor confidence, resulting in an appreciation of the Korean won by 42 per cent, the Thai baht by 29 per cent, the Philippine peso by 3 per cent and the Malaysian ringgit by 2 per cent, against the US dollar. The Indonesian rupiah however, continued to depreciate and fell by 31 per cent against the US dollar against a backdrop of an uncertain economic and political environment. The Japanese yen appreciated against the US dollar by 12 per cent in response to initiatives undertaken to address financial sector reforms. Meanwhile, most European currencies appreciated against the US dollar in anticipation of the much awaited introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999. Financial sector problems in Russia led to a collapse of the rouble, which depreciated by 71 per cent against the US dollar in 1998. The South African rand and the Brazilian real depreciated by 17 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, indicating the continuing uncertainty in international currency markets.",

    "text": "Short-term interest rates continued to drop in response to declining inflation rates world-wide. Six months LIBOR declined from 5.84 per cent per annum at the end of 1997 to 5.06 per cent per annum at the end of 1998. Commitments towards price stability and the perception of long-run low inflation rates resulted in a further drop in long-term interest rates. For example, the 30 year US Treasury bond rate declined from 5.81 per cent in December 1997 to 5.59 per cent in December 1998. However, despite this declining trend in interest rates, one of the disturbing factors observed during 1998 was the high risk premiums factored into bond issues in international capital markets, particularly by emerging market economies, which in turn prolonged the time required for economic recovery in those countries. While both sovereign issues and private issues were affected adversely, the latter took the full brunt. For example, interest spreads increased by over 300 basis points (bps) for issues by India, the Philippines and Thailand, while those for Korea and Hong Kong increased by over 500 bps. Spreads on Indonesian and Malaysian issues increased by over 1,000 bps. As a result, net private capital flows world-wide declined sharply from US dollars 124 billion in 1997 to US",

Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank took the lead in efforts to stabilise crisis driven economies by providing technical assistance and financial resources. The IMF proposed a 45 per cent increase of its quota to meet global resource needs in the current context. It re-activated the General Agreement to Borrow (GAB) to facilitate extended financing arrangements for Russia in the wake of the rouble crisis, while activating the New Agreement to Borrow (NAB) to support the Brazilian economic and financial programme.",

    "text": "Central banks use operational and intermediate targets to guide policy. When a central bank makes a change to monetary instruments with the objective of having an impact on the final targets, the inflation rate and the growth rate of the economy, the transmission could take place through several channels. Interest rates and exchange rates have been identified as two main channels through which the effect of changes in monetary policy are transmitted to the final targets1. Therefore, interest rates and exchange rates could serve as operational targets, and could be used to guide the monetary policy. The Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) is a combination of interest rates and exchange rates that could be used as an operational target.",

    "text": "Both interest rates and exchange rates influence the aggregate demand and supply which are the deciding factors of inflation and economic growth. An increase in interest rates will reduce aggregate demand by discouraging investment and consumption as well as the aggregate supply while encouraging savings. Usually, the impact on aggregate demand is greater than on aggregate supply thereby causing a reduction in the equilibrium price level and output. A depreciation in the exchange rate increases cost of production and causes a reduction in aggregate supply if firms use a large percentage of imported intermediate goods. It also enhances exporters' income causing an upward pressure on demand. The combined effect is an increase in the price level. Thus, an increase in interest rates and a depreciation of the exchange rate have opposite impacts on prices. Or, viewed another way, a decrease in interest rates and a depreciation of the exchange rate both lead to higher prices. Since both interest rates and exchange rates respond to policy changes and. both variables have an impact on the final target, it is not sufficient to monitor the two variables individually and independently. Therefore, a more appropriate indicator is the MCI, a weighted average of the two variables. The MCI provides the policy maker with the flexibility to make smaller changes to one variable and make compensatory changes to the other as sometimes required by market conditions. This flexibility is more useful when exchange rates are freely floating without much intervention by the monetary authority.",

It measures the pressure ol the interest rate and exchange rate deviations on the deviation of inflation from the level mat prevailed in the base period. Generally, the weight associated with the interest rate is calibrated as 1 and the weight associated with the exchange rate is calibrated as l/oo. This implies that an increase of one percentage point in the interest rate has the same impact on the MCI as 0) percent change in the exchange rate. The weight depends on the openness of an economy. Relatively less open economies could have a weight as high as 10 (i.e. a 100 basis point change in interest rates has 10 times the impact of a one percent change in the exchange rate) while open economies with heavy dependence on imports could have smaller weights around I3.",

As data on freely moving interest rates and exchange rates in Sri Lanka are available for a relatively short period of time, a parsimonious reduced form model was used to construct weights for the MCI. The month to month variation of the Colombo Consumers' Price Index was taken as the inflation rate. The three-month Treasury Bill rate determined in the primary market was used as the nominal interest rate. The real interest rate was derived by subtracting the expected inflation rate from the nominal interest rate. The expected inflation was derived by assuming the existence of forward looking rational expectations on inflation. Thus, the expected inflation at any month was taken as the average month-to-month inflation rate of the future nine months4. The real effective exchange rate (REER) with respect to five major importing countries is used as the exchange rate. The base period was taken as January 1993. The relevant lag period is nine months. Relative weights were obtained by regressing the 9 month lagged real interest rate and the REER on the",

The headline inflation is a combination of the pressures indicated by the MCI and other exogenous demand and supply shocks such as changes in autonomous consumption and weather associated changes in production. The MCI should also not be treated as a fundamental measure of monetary policy. It is only an operational target. The MCI also has some technical drawbacks. It is not clear if more variables than the interest rate and exchange rate should be included in the MCI. It suffers from the difficulties in estimating the other relative weights of its components.

The exchange rate in New Zealand depreciated as a result of the Asian Crisis, and to match this decline interest rates had to be raised so that the desirable path of the MCI is maintained. This sharp rise in interest rates weakened the economy considerably. The RBNZ is now following a more relaxed approach on determining required change in interest rates.",

In addition, in the context of the recent world financial market crisis, greater emphasis needs to be placed on financial system soundness and improving corporate governance. Significant progress has been made in some areas, particularly financial market reforms, improving financial market soundness, public enterprise reforms through private sector participation and tax reforms including tariffs. Progress in other areas, however, is inadequate. Meanwhile, there are several short-term challenges and disturbing trends that need to be highlighted.",

Sri Lanka maintained an export volume growth rate of 8 per cent during the past four years. In 1997, the country's export volume grew by 11 per cent, comparable to the growth of world exports and of developing countries. With the sharp contraction of the world export growth to 3.6 per cent in 1998, developing country export growth has decelerated to 1.8 per cent and Sri Lanka's export growth declined to 0.1 per cent. Prospects for 1999 are not very encouraging. The current expectations are that world trade will recover somewhat during the second half of 1999 and that the developing country export volumes would grow by 4.7 per cent. However, a complete recovery is unlikely within the next two years. This would be a challenge for open small economies like Sri Lanka, which are attempting to achieve faster economic growth through greater integration with the world economy. Therefore, a continuation of the depressed world market conditions is likely to slow down economic growth and employment generation in 1999.",

    "text": "It should be mentioned that inflationary pressures of the enlarged budget deficit were not clearly felt during 1998 as the country benefited from the sharp reduction in import prices, particularly for crude oil, wheat grain, fertiliser and sugar, under depressed world market conditions. These price reductions helped to contain the growth in the import bill despite a depreciation of the rupee (9.6 per cent against the US dollar), thus leaving more resources with the banking system. It is clear that the resources freed by these reductions in the international prices of key commodities imported to Sri Lanka and the relatively slow growth of private sector credit enabled the banking system to finance a large proportion of the enlarged budget deficit without exerting excessive pressure on interest rates. Current trends indicate that a further large reduction in import prices is unlikely to occur. In this context, the government may not have the flexibility of running an expansionary fiscal policy without reversing the recent favourable trend in inflation.",

Higher expenditures in non-defence areas such as salaries and wages and transfers to loss making public sector entities (Sri Lanka Railways and the Postal Department) also contributed to the increased deficit. Given the size of fiscal slippage in 1998 and the weaker prospects for higher economic growth in 1999, measures should be put in place to reduce the fiscal deficit to around 7.5 per cent of GDP in 1999, so that further fiscal consolidation could be targeted for 2000.

Sri Lanka's inflation rate has generally been higher than the average inflation rate of her trading partners and competitors. This has led to the depreciation of the exchange rate by about 5-6 per cent per year to enable Sri Lanka to remain competitive in world markets. As mentioned in the 1997 Annual Report, the exchange rate depreciation has a feedback effect on inflation as Sri Lanka is a highly trade dependent economy where exports and imports together account for about 70 per cent of GDP. The internal wage setting mechanism, which links many wages directly or indirectly to inflation rather than to labour productivity, has been another channel in this inflation-wage-exchange rate nexus. This has been further complicated by the increased security expenditures. Thus, continuing high budget deficits have made it a challenging task to eliminate high inflationary expectations among the public. Hence, measures have to be in place for a sustainable reduction in inflation by containing the fiscal deficit at below 5 per cent within the next three years and introducing a productivity based wage setting mechanism. These have to be supplemented with other measures to eliminate structural weaknesses in the labour market - measures which would make the labour market more flexible, while providing equal protection to both workers and employers in a competitive environment.",

There are several socio-economic issues associated with the current structure and trends in population. Unemployment, land fragmentation, the high cost of social welfare such as education and health, housing problems and an ageing population are major issues that need to be addressed early. The ageing of the population and a rising old age dependency ratio require a well planned strategy and a carefully designed social security system to avoid excessive burdens on the working population and an erosion of standards of living during old age.

The various schemes that have evolved now entail cumbersome procedures that require close supervision and monitoring to achieve maximum utilisation. Quota administration in Sri Lanka had been in some disarray in 1998 as quotas to the USA for some items such as men's and boys' jackets and shirts were over utilised and the Textile Quota Board had to take action to avoid the possible imposition of an embargo by the USA. Until quotas are fully phased out in 2005 under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, optimal utilisation of quotas needs to be ensured to reap the full potential benefits under the existing international trade framework. Hence, the quota administration needs to be done efficiently. Although market based quota distribution through auctioning of quotas would have produced better results in terms of quota utilisation, various other objectives, such as the need to promote new investments, regionalise industries and generate more employment, have entered into the quota administration in Sri Lanka. Although a fundamental change in the quota allocation system may not be necessary, it should be the responsibility of quota administrators to ensure the smooth functioning of the system, so that the growth of the textile and garment industry and trade will not be interrupted. This is all the more important as the global competition among suppliers has intensified in the context of depressed world market conditions and there is a need to ensure a smooth transition to face more intense competition in a quota-free trading environment after 2005.",

    "text": "improvement in the fiscal situation during 1994-97, several years of low inflation are required for people's perceptions regarding high inflation and high interest rates to disappear and private long-term real investment to pick up. Sri Lanka is yet to make sufficient progress towards a steady reduction in the fiscal deficit, inflation and interest rates. Fourth, Sri Lanka maintained a complicated investment regime which discriminated against all non-export oriented sectors, including the traditional plantation crops, after the economic liberalisation in 1977, with a view to promoting export-led industrialisation with foreign participation. This biased incentive regime has existed for a long period. New elements have been added towards equalisation of incentives among different sectors through measures such as provision of foreign currency loans to non-BOI exporters, new fiscal incentives to the non-BOI sector including the relaxation of the export share requirement to be eligible for BOI concessions. However, the current investment regime needs to be simplified, particularly with a view to eliminating the inbuilt discretionary elements. A simple and transparent investment regime, with equal incentives for all sectors, and a narrow negative list would encourage new investment. Fifth, insufficient infrastructure facilities were another constraint to private sector investment. Significant improvements have been made in the power and telecommunication sectors, but further progress in all key areas of infrastructure, including health and education, is necessary. Sixth, the trade policy regime, particularly the provisions related to agriculture, has not been transparent. Ad hoc changes in tariffs and licensing have introduced uncertainty regarding the future direction of trade policy, discouraging the entry of the private sector into commercial farming in a consistent manner and developing better marketing links with the small scale non-plantation agricultural sector. This problem is now being addressed. The last remaining licenses were eliminated in 1996 and agricultural products are now placed at the maximum tariff rate of 35 per cent. Requests for greater protection of the agricultural sector are still voiced at various fora. Steady commitment to the current liberal policy for several years is required for investors to be convinced that there is a credible and consistent trade policy related to agricultural products. Seventh, inflexible labour markets and rigid labour laws that do not give sufficient weight to the concerns of investors are considered to be a major obstacle for faster growth of private investment. These are some of the long-term structural policy issues that have to be addressed, if Sri Lanka is to accelerate investment and economic growth within the next three years.",
