    "text": "The mid year population in 1998 has been estimated at 18.8 million. This shows that population growth declined to 1.2 per cent from 1.3 per cent in 1997. The decline was a result of a reduction in the natural increase in population. There has been an addition of 222,000 to the mid year population in 1998. The population density, which is estimated as the number of persons per sq. km. of land, increased to 299 in 1998 from 296 in 1997. While the demographic transition, together with improvements in other socio-economic conditions, has substantially reduced the growth rate of the population to well below that of most other developing countries, an annual addition of over 200,000 to the population has become a burden on other limited resources. As mentioned in last year's Annual Report, there are several socio\u00adeconomic issues associated with the current structure and trends in population. Unemployment, land fragmentation, the high cost of social welfare such as education, health and housing and problems associated with an ageing population continue to be some of the major issues. The ageing of the population and a rising old age dependency ratio require a well planned strategy and a carefully designed social security system to avoid excessive burdens on the working population and an erosion of standards of living during old age. This has to be done in a context of policies designed to make labour markets more flexible, adaptable to the changing labour market needs and complementary to other growth-oriented policies.",

A larger part of the new employment opportunities generated has been in the private sector. This trend is confirmed by both the Department of Census and Statistics survey and the Central Bank's survey data. Public sector employment in 1998 was estimated at 1.09 million, recording a marginal increase of 1.8 per cent over 1997. The employment in the government sector (central and local) increased by 3.7 per cent, a higher rate of increase than in the previous two years. Semi-government institutions recorded a marginal decline of 2.9 per cent in their employment level following considerable declines in the previous three years.",

    "text": "A steady decline in unemployment in recent years has been a reflection of the rapid economic growth and the resultant growth of employment opportunities in the country. Persons who are looking for or are available for work but do not have employment are considered as the unemployed. The unemployment rate (unemployed persons as a percentage of the labour force) has declined from 15.9 per cent in 1990 to 9.1 per cent in the third quarter 1998, recording a drop of 6.8 percentage points. The estimate of the unemployment rate in 1998 had some downward bias due to increased coverage of unpaid family workers as employed persons in the labour force. When these data are adjusted to exclude unpaid family workers, the unemployment rate was estimated at 10.3 per cent in the third quarter of 1998 compared to 11.4 per cent in 1997. Thus, in 1998, the unemployment rate has, in fact, declined notably by about one percentage point.",
