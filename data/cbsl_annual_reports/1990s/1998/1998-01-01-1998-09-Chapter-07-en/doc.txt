7. POPULATION, LABOUR FORCE AND EMPLOYMENT

7.1 Population

The mid year population in 1998 has been estimated at 18.8 million. This shows that population growth declined to 1.2 per cent from 1.3 per cent in 1997. The decline was a result of a reduction in the natural increase in population. There has been an addition of 222,000 to the mid year population in 1998. The population density, which is estimated as the number of persons per sq. km. of land, increased to 299 in 1998 from 296 in 1997. While the demographic transition, together with improvements in other socio-economic conditions, has substantially reduced the growth rate of the population to well below that of most other developing countries, an annual addition of over 200,000 to the population has become a burden on other limited resources. As mentioned in last year's Annual Report, there are several socioÂ­economic issues associated with the current structure and trends in population. Unemployment, land fragmentation, the high cost of social welfare such as education, health and housing and problems associated with an ageing population continue to be some of the major issues. The ageing of the population and a rising old age dependency ratio require a well planned strategy and a carefully designed social security system to avoid excessive burdens on the working population and an erosion of standards of living during old age. This has to be done in a context of policies designed to make labour markets more flexible, adaptable to the changing labour market needs and complementary to other growth-oriented policies.

7.2 Labour Force

A series of quarterly labour force data is available from the surveys conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics since 1990. According to this survey, the labour force is defined as the economically active population aged 10 years and above. The labour force at the end of the third quarter of 1998 was estimated at 6.7 million. This estimate is not strictly comparable with previous estimates, as the latest survey includes unpaid female family workers, such as housewives engaging in

supporting family income generating activities, especially in the agricultural sector, who were counted as 'not in labour force' in previous years. The labour force participation rate, i.e., labour force as a percentage of household population aged 10 years and above, has been estimated at 52 per cent in the third quarter of 1998. The labour force participation rate has fluctuated within a range of 48-52 per cent during the period since 1990. While there has been an increase in labour force participation from 49 per cent in 1997 to 52 per cent in 1998, this increase was partly a reflection of the improved coverage of the workforce. The growing entry of females to the labour force appears to be an important reason for this increase.

7.3 Employment

hour or more during the week preceding the collection of data from that person. Persons who are temporarily absent from work are also considered as employed. Employees, employers, self-employees (own account workers) and unpaid family workers are the broad categories of the employed. According to the surveys, employment has risen steadily from 84.1 per cent of the labour force in 1990 to 90.9 per cent by the end of the third quarter of 1998. Correspondingly, the unemployment rate has fallen from 15.9 per cent of the labour force to 9.1 per cent during that period.

Manufacturing, construction, trade, hotels, insurance, real estate and personal services were key areas of employment generation. Enterprises under the BOI, with 137 new projects commencing operations in 1998, generated direct employment for nearly 36,200 persons. The manufacturing sector is estimated to have generated around 27,000 new employment opportunities.

The construction sector also had generated about 5,400 new jobs. New employment provided by the public sector was estimated at about 19,000. The number of casual workers (those not in the permanent cadre) accounted for 9.1 per cent of the total public sector employment in 1998.

While data on the change in the agricultural sector are not available, the total employment in this sector is estimated at 2.4 million and represented 38 per cent of the employed work force. A little over 15 per cent of the employed workforce were in the manufacturing sector, while the balance 47 per cent were in the services sector. Data also revealed that the employment generation was particularly evident in small scale business and manufacturing activities throughout the country.

The share of public sector employment (government and semi-government) in total employment continued to decline in 1998. The public sector share in total employment has fallen

(b) The large increase in labour force and employment in 1998 was partly due to the increase in coverage of female unpaid family workers in the agricultural sector. In the sector-wise breakdown, this is shown in the private sector 'other" category. Therefore, the total labour force and the employed in the private sector 'other' category are not comparable between 1998 and other years.

from 25 per cent of employment in 1993 to nearly 18 per cent in 1998. The decline has taken place particularly in the semi-government sector with the ongoing public enterprise reforms with private sector participation and the expansion of private sector economic activity. A larger part of the new employment opportunities generated has been in the private sector. This trend is confirmed by both the Department of Census and Statistics survey and the Central Bank's survey data. Public sector employment in 1998 was estimated at 1.09 million, recording a marginal increase of 1.8 per cent over 1997. The employment in the government sector (central and local) increased by 3.7 per cent, a higher rate of increase than in the previous two years. Semi-government institutions recorded a marginal decline of 2.9 per cent in their employment level following considerable declines in the previous three years.

7.4 Unemployment

A steady decline in unemployment in recent years has been a reflection of the rapid economic growth and the resultant growth of employment opportunities in the country. Persons who are looking for or are available for work but do not have employment are considered as the unemployed. The unemployment rate (unemployed persons as a percentage of the labour force) has declined from 15.9 per cent in 1990 to 9.1 per cent in the third quarter 1998, recording a drop of 6.8 percentage points. The estimate of the unemployment rate in 1998 had some downward bias due to increased coverage of unpaid family workers as employed persons in the labour force. When these data are adjusted to exclude unpaid family workers, the unemployment rate was estimated at 10.3 per cent in the third quarter of 1998 compared to 11.4 per cent in 1997. Thus, in 1998, the unemployment rate has, in fact, declined notably by about one percentage point.

According to the survey, the decline in unemployment in the country was seen in both male and female unemployment although unemployment among females was twice as high as for males. The male unemployment rate declined from 11.8 per cent in 1990 to 7.1 per cent in the third quarter of 1998, whereas the

Source: Department of Census and Statistics

female unemployment rate fell from 23.4 per cent to 12.7 per cent during the same period. It is noteworthy that the female unemployment rate has declined faster, reducing the female-male gap in the unemployment rate from nearly 12 percentage points in 1990 to 6 percentage points in 1998.

Another salient feature in recent trends in unemployment has been the continuously higher unemployment among persons with higher formal educational qualifications. Although unemployment rates at all levels of education have declined over time, the unemployment rate among persons with qualifications of GCE (A/L) and above has remained at a significantly higher level than that of the unemployment rate in the population as a whole. In fact, the proportion of persons with qualifications of GCE (A/L) and above in total unemployment increased from 15

per cent in 1990 to 21 per cent in 1998, whereas the proportion of persons with these qualifications only rose from 8 per cent to around 13 per cent for the entire labour force. A similar trend is seen, when those in the labour force with qualifications of GCE (O/L) and above are considered, although the differences are somewhat less severe. This indicates the mismatch between academic training and employment opportunities.

The current education system appears to have contributed largely to this situation. The current education system is based on testing the textbook knowledge of students in traditional subjects that do not equip them adequately to function effectively in an increasingly competitive and dynamic modern work environment. Meanwhile, a greater demand exists in the emerging private sector labour market for persons qualified in professional and technical fields such as accountancy, finance, management, marketing, computer applications and the English language. Consequently, the system tends to create expectations among students that cannot be fulfilled by their inadequate traditional academic training. Such students often wait for white-collar jobs after leaving school. Therefore, the higher the formal academic qualifications acquired under the existing education

system, the less could be the opportunities for gaining the expected employment. This is a highly simplified description of the unemployment problem among the higher educated in the country, which is considered most acute. The current education reforms are aimed at addressing this issue as well as other aspects, so that the education system would produce persons who are readily employable in the market.

Recent estimates based on the Labour Force Survey indicate differences in unemployment among the provinces in the country. The rate of unemployment was lowest in the North Central Province (6.7 per cent), while the highest unemployment was in the Southern Province (13.6 per cent).

7.5 Foreign Employment

According to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), migration for foreign employment through recorded sources increased gradually until 1995, reaching the highest level of about 172,000 persons per annum. While there had been a decline in the number of people leaving for employment abroad during 1996 and 1997, this number is estimated to have increased by about 7 per cent to around 158,000 persons in 1998. The Bureau has also intensified its surveillance through counters at the airport so that persons migrating for foreign employment will have the required registration with the Bureau.

During the year, the government continued to provide pre-employment training and welfare services for employees abroad and their families. In 1998, twelve welfare officers were appointed to assist Sri Lankan employees in the Middle Eastern countries and Singapore. The SLBFE has introduceda number of support facilities for migrant workers and their families. These included the provision of training facilities to prospective migrant workers, an insurance scheme for migrant workers registered with the SLBFE, provisions of air fare to employees who return before the expiry of their contract periods, a scholarship programme for children and funding a low cost housing programme implemented through People's Bank.
