12 November, 1998. Operating Intructions to Commercial Banks

INTRODUCTION OF THE EUROPEAN SINGLE CURRENCY - THE "EURO"

The European Union decided to introduce a single currency called the "euro" for its member countries with

effect from 1.1.1999, on which date the conversion rates of particpating countries' national currencies are

expected to be locked irrevocably against the new currency. Eleven European countries, namely, Austria,

Belgium, finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain have agreed to

accept the proposed single currency against their national currencies. During the transition period from 1.1.1999

to 31.12.2001, the euro w i l l co-exist with the national currencies of the above participating member countries.

From 1.1.2002, such national currencies w i l l cease to exist.

2. On the eve of the introduction of the euro, we would like to draw your attention to the need for commercial

banks to examine their business processes in order to ensure they are ready to conduct normal business operations

in the new currency from 1st January, 1999. Some important implications that need to be examined include those

on deal conversion, re-denomination, payment system, price sources and continuity of contracts. In this

connection, a copy of policy statement issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is attached

herewith. Y o u are requested to closely follow the instructions contained in it as well as other statements issued

by the ICC from time to time, with regard to the international practices arising from the introduction of the euro.

3. In this connection, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Wishes to infrom all commercial banks that it has no

objection t o -

(a) the opening and maintenance of Nostro Accounts in euro currency by commercial banks operating in Sri

Lanka to effect payments or receipts beginining from 1.1.1999; and

(b) the designation of the euro as a foreign currency for Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBU), Non-

Resident Foreign Currency (NRFC) Accounts, Resident Non-National Foreign Currency (RNNFC)

Accounts, Resident Foreign Currency (RFC) Accounts, Exporter's Foreign Currency (EFC) Accounts

with effect from 1.1.1999 for the purposes mentioned in our Circular Nos.FCBS 1/79 of 2nd May, 1979, BC/F-922/77 of 1.3.1978 and Operating Instructions Nos. EC/08/88(D) of 5.5.1988, EC/22/90(D) of 30.3.1990, EC/19/80 (D) of 14.5.1980, EC/52/91 (D) of 1.8.1991 and EC/41/93(D) of 29.3.1993.

4. Commercial banks should take the full responsibility for maintenance.operation of relevant accounts and

honouring of such contracts entered into with their customers in euro, or in national currencies of the participating

member countries referred to above, and are required to provide details to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on the

current reporting schedules with regard to any operation in euro or national currencies of the participating member

countries carried out by them.

The World Business Organisation

Policy Statement

The impact of the european economic and monetary union on monetary obligations related to

transactions involving ICC Rules

Prepared by the Commission on Banking Technique and Practice

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is the world business organization, based in Paris. The ICC Commissions on Banking Technique & Practice, International Commercial Practice, and Insurance, develop and maintain uniform rules for international trade, including the Uniform Rules for Contract Guarantees (URCG 325), Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG 458), Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 500), Uniform Rules for Collections (URC 522), Uniform Rules for Contract Bonds (URCB 524), Uniform Rules for Bank to Bank Reimbursements (URR 525) (hereinafter referred to collectively as "ICC Rules").

The Introduction of the EURO, the European single currency, shall not have the effect of altering, discharging or excusing performance under any instrument subject to ICC Rules. This "Policy Statement" emphasized the need to correctly interpret and apply ICC Rules. Consequently, ICC National Committees and associated organizations are strongly urged to distribute this Policy Statement as widely as possible to help ensure the future smooth running of the instruments issued under ICC Rules. This Policy Statement does not amend any articles of ICC Rules in any way, but merely indicates the correct interpretation thereof.

1. General

1.1 As of 1 January 1999, the EURO will be substituted for the national currencies of those European Union member states participating in European Economic and Monetary Union (hereinafter, "EMU-Participating States") which are to be designated in May 1998. During the transitional period running from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001, the EURO (1 EURO -100 Cents) will also be divided into the national currency units of the EMU-Participating States according to conversion rates which are to be irrevocably fixed by the Council of the European Union as of 1 January 1999 ("conversion rates"). The term "national denomination" as used below refers to the currency of any EMU-Participating State before 1 January 1999.

During the transition period persons are free to use either the EURO or the national denomination, but will not (unless otherwise agreed) be obliged to receive or make payment in EURO. However, any amount denominated either in EURO or in a national denomination of a given EMU-Participating State and payable within that state by crediting an account of the creditor, may be paid by the debtor either in EURO or in that national denomination, with any necessary conversion being affected at the conversion rate.

As of 1 January 1999 the ECU will be replaced by the EURO at the rate of one EURO to one ECU.

1.2 As from 1 January 2002 the national denominations will cease to exist and the EURO will be the only legal currency in the EMU-Participating States; all payments must be in EURO.

1.3 Continuity of contract will not be affected by the introduction of the EURO.

1.4 The above principles affecting national denominations are legally binding in all member states of the European Union, and apply equally to payment to be made in a national denomination by persons located outside the European Union, due to the generally accepted legal principle that the definition of what constitutes legal tender is governed by the law of the country whose currency is involved (sometimes referred to as the lex monesae principle).

2. Consequences of the i n t r o d u c t i o n of the E U R O on practice under various I C C rules :

2.1 UCP 500 for Documentary Credits (including standby letters of credit)

Below are the different possible cases and the relevant rules of interpretation.

xiii

2.1.1. Documentary credits issued and payable before 1 January 1999 in a national denomination -Payment must be made and documents denominated in the currency of the credit.

2.1.2 Documentary credits issued before 1 January 1999 and payable before 1 January 2002 in a national denomination - Payment must be made in the currency of the credit, but documents may be presented either in the currency of the credit or in the EURO equivalent; however, where payment is to be made in the currency of an EMU-Participating State and by crediting an account located in such member state, payment may at the debtor's (e.g., issuing bank's) option be effected in the EURO equivalent.

2.1.3 Documentary credits issued in an national denomination before 1 January 1999 and payable on or after 1 January 2002 - Payment must be made in EURO, but documents may be presented either in the currency of the credit or in the EURO equivalent (for documents issued on or after 1 January 1999); Documents issued on or after 1 January 2002 must be denominated in the EURO.

2.1.4 Documentary Credits issued and payable on or before 1 January 1999 and before 1 January 2002 in a national denomination or in EURO - Payment must be made in the currency of the credit but documents may be presented in the currency of the credit or in the EURO equivalent or in the equivalent cross value in the national denomination at the beneficiary's place of business; however, where the currency of the credit is a national denomination and payment is to be made in the currency of a particular EMU - Participating State by crediting an account located in such member state, payment may at the debtor's (e.g., issuing bank's) option be effected in EURO.
