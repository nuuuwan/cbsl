    "text": "Monetary policy in 1998 focussed on making further progress towards achieving financial market stability and price stability. The policy had to be conducted in a highly unstable external environment. The world banking industry and financial markets had been experiencing tremendous instability since mid 1997. The East Asian financial market turmoil had immediate contagion effects and more lasting adverse repercussions on world financial and commodity markets. The subsequent eruption of the payments crisis in Russia and the economic problems in Brazil and Japan intensified the instability. In addition, there were concerns about the stability of some financial institutions western countries due to their large exposures to countries in financial distress. The stability of financial institutions in many countries was threatened by the weaknesses of their own corporate governance and regulatory framework and supervisory standards. Many financial institutions in crisis countries were closed down. Financial flows to developing countries slowed down significantly, and financial policies were tightened, initially raising interest rates to stabilise exchange rates. There were speculations about whether China would be compelled to devalue its currency to restore competitiveness. While market confidence in some of the Asian crisis hit countries was being slowly restored, interest rates of western industrial countries, as well as many other countries were adjusted downwards to avoid a sharper economic depression. With this instability in world financial markets, the directions of exchange rate movements were not clear and the high volatility of exchange rates among key currencies, particularly the yen/US dollar rate, made it a challenging task to co-ordinate exchange rate and monetary policies for relatively more open and small economies like Sri Lanka. Despite these difficulties, and a constraint created by a larger than expected domestic fiscal deficit, monetary controls and a flexibly managed exchange rate helped to maintain domestic financial market stability in 1998.",

The uncertainty in regional financial markets and somewhat higher domestic inflation at the beginning of 1998 required tightening of the policy stance in the first few months of the year. Although a slight relaxation was effected in the second quarter, renewed volatility in the foreign exchange market required a further tightening of policy. This stance was maintained until the last quarter, when a reduction in inflationary pressures and the emergence of relative stability in the exchange markets permitted some easing of policy.

    "text": "The developments in the latter part of 1997 and in 1998 clearly demonstrated the links between external events and domestic markets, and the need to maintain consistent exchange and monetary policies. The East Asian financial crisis and the resultant volatility in international currency markets in the second half of 1997 also led to uncertainty in the domestic foreign exchange market. This continued into 1998 with the market speculating that a large depreciation of the rupee would be effected. The Central Bank indicated clearly that no such depreciation of the rupee was envisaged. Further, in order to discourage the use of relatively inexpensive call market funds for speculative purchases of foreign currency, the repo rate was raised by 200 basis points in December 1997 and by a further 100 basis points in January 1998. Adjustments were also made in the Central Bank's discount and rediscount rates and the margin between these rates to support this tightening of the policy stance. These measures, together with some progress towards financial market and exchange rate stability in East Asia, were successful in reducing the speculative pressures. In fact, commercial banks sold US dollars 54 million to the Central Bank in March and April. This permitted a slight relaxation in policy and the overnight repo rate was gradually reduced from 12.00 per cent to 11.65 per cent by end April. However, a resurgence of international volatility and associated domestic speculative activity thereafter, prompted the Central Bank to tighten policy again by raising the repo rate to 12.00 per cent, by mid May.",

The Central Bank was therefore able to relax the monetary policy stance somewhat, without inducing further instability, by reducing the overnight repo rate in several steps to 11.25 per cent by the end of December 1998.",

    "text": "From 06 November 1998, an overnight reverse repo facility was reintroduced by the Central Bank. The Bank first introduced a reverse repurchase facility on a limited scale in 1995, when a shortage of market liquidity had created a tendency for call money rates to rise to unacceptably high levels. However, due to the limited amounts of funds offered and certain structural weaknesses in the market, this facility did not achieve its objective of stabilising the upper end of the interest rates in the call money market. Its use was discontinued in January 1996. The new facility introduced in November 1998 differs from the initial facility in several respects. It is limited, at present, to overnight transactions. It is open not only to commercial banks, but also to institutions which are not commercial banks but are Primary Dealers for Treasury bonds and bills. The major difference is that an unlimited volume of funds is available at a fixed rate, provided that the specified collateral, viz., Treasury bills or bonds, could be provided. Moreover, unlike in 1995 when the facility was created in conditions of a severe liquidity shortage, the market was quite liquid in 1998 and hence, the facility was not utilised very often. Its introduction was more in the nature of an assurance to market players that stability in interest rates would be preserved, rather than a means of injecting liquidity into the system immediately.",

A decline in domestic economic growth and a reduction in the growth of imports and exports constrained the growth in the banking sector. In addition, uncertainty in international financial markets and the comparatively low domestic interest rates which made borrowing in foreign currency less attractive, tended to lead to a contraction in the activities of the FCBUs. The total assets of the domestic units of commercial banks grew nearly at the same level in the previous year (13 per cent). Total assets of FCBUs declined by 9 per cent, in contrast to the significant growth of 17.6 per cent in 1997. A noteworthy feature was the reduction in the FCBU exposure to the domestic sector. The net foreign asset position of the FCBUs improved in 1998, despite the extension of a syndicated loan of US dollars 100 million to the Government of Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, net foreign assets of the domestic banking units deteriorated mainly due to increases in foreign liabilities. A substantial increase in foreign currency deposits was the main reason for the higher level of foreign liabilities. This appeared to reflect a desire on the part of residents to maintain their deposits in foreign currency in the context of volatile international foreign exchange markets and an expected large depreciation of the rupee.",

All the other sectors indicated marginal improvements in their shares of total credit. In terms of the relative importance in sectoral credit growth, major increases have been recorded in consumption, housing, tourism, financial, agricultural and other sectors.",

An important development that took place in the year 1998 was the commencement of the restructuring of Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) by setting up Regional Development Banks (RDBs). A RDB is to be established in each province. This will take over the business of existing RRDBs in that province. This would ensure that each province in the country would have a development bank which would provide banking facilities in that area. As a first step towards implementing the restructuring programme, in terms of the provisions of the Regional Development Banks Act No.6 of 1997, a RDB named Ruhuna Development Bank was established by amalgamating the RRDBs of Galle, Matara and Hambantota. Subsequently, two more RDBs were set up in 1998, viz., the Kandurata Development Bank and the Rajarata Development Bank. This resulted in reducing the total number of RRDBs from 17 at end 1997 to 9 at end 1998. These RDBs have been issued licences to function as specialised banks under the Banking Act.",

In addition, eight extension offices were opened by domestic banks, while 2 ASC branches of BOC were upgraded to main branches. The number of branches of domestic banks increased from 956 to 993 at end 1998. The total number of foreign bank branches increased by 2 with the setting up of a branch each by Muslim Commercial Bank Ltd. and The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd. In addition, People's Bank opened 18 pawning centres and 3 service centres during the year. This increase in the number of branches improved the provision of banking services and reduced the number of persons^ served by a commercial bank branch (excluding pawning centres) from 18,589 persons in 1997 to 18,104 persons in 1998. With the amalgamation of some RRDBs into RDBs, the total number of RRDB branches decreased from 176 at end 1997 to 96 at end 1998. Correspondingly, the total number of RDB branches stood at 80 at end 1998. The National Savings Bank expanded its branch network to 100 during the year.",

One such step was the introduction of credit cards which marked Sri Lanka's first move towards a cashless society. There are four parties involved in credit card operations, viz., the credit card company which owns the trademark of the card, the bank which issues (he card, the merchant and the cardholder. When issuing a credit card, the issuing bank and the card applicant enter into an agreement which includes terms and conditions relating to credit card operations.

Its usage was initially limited due to the limited recognition of tlie card, difficulties in convincing customers and merchants of the benefits of using plastic money and also the lack of awareness of people about credit cards. However, over the years the acceptance of the card increased. Commercial banks began issuing credit cards in the 1980s, along with the introduction of a range of new financial instruments. These were initially for local transactions only. With the liberalisation of the current account following the acceptance of Article VIII status of the IMF by Sri Lanka in 1994, banks began to issue global access credit cards as well. The popularity of credit cards with the public has increased rapidly with greater awareness of their advantages. Various facilities and benefits offered by the card issuing banks, together with aggressive advertising campaigns, have also helped to popularise credit cards.",

In addition, the National Development Bank and the DFCC Bank too continued their regional branch expansion programmes, thereby making their services accessible to people living in remote parts of the country. The RRDBs are being restructured to form Regional Development Banks (RDBs). Three such RDBs had commenced operations by end 1998. In the new RDBs the capital base was enhanced, diversifying the ownership among the two state banks, the National Savings Bank and the Employees' Provident Fund, in addition to the share ownership of the Central Bank. Further, RDB management was professionalised by making provisions for the appointment of a professional as the General Manager who will function as the Chief Executive Officer of the RDB.",

A similar scheme has also been introduced in respect of crops being funded under a credit scheme implemented by the Department of Export Agriculture.

At end 1998, 639,106 shares of SBS to a value of Rs. 263 million had been issued to members. The total deposits of SBS, including the value of shares issued, stood at Rs.458 million as at that date. With regard to loan disbursements, 68,474 micro loans to a value of Rs.238 million had been disbursed to members in respect of agriculture, small trading, fisheries, consumption and to a lesser extent, distress relief purposes. This reflects an average loan size of Rs.3,471, a very small micro-finance facility. The overall recovery rate maintained by the SBS has been reported at 96 percent. In addition, loans were also disbursed under the Samurdhi Development Credit Programme (SASANA) and the Samurdhi Enterprise Credit Programme (SAVANA) through the two state banks during the year under review. The total number of loans granted under both schemes stood at 82,725, while the value was Rs. 589 million. A recovery rate of 66 per cent has been reported in the SASANA Scheme and 98 per cent in the SAVANA Scheme as at end December 1998.",

In terms of sectors, the trading sector received 32 per cent of the total lease finance, while the services sector and the transportation sector received 22 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively. In addition, the industrial sector (16 per cent), the construction sector (4 per cent) and the agriculture sector (3 per cent) also received significant levels of finance. Leasing companies indicated that they were affected by competition from other financial institutions and by the GST imposed on leases. Another constraint faced by most leasing companies was the difficulty in obtaining long-term funds for financing leases.",

This resulted in a relatively stable money market with less volatile call market interest rates, and slightly higher repo rates and Treasury bill rates. The market was generally liquid, partly due to the slower growth in credit and the inflow of foreign funds in the second half of 1998. Reflecting this availability of liquidity, most primary Treasury bill auctions were over-subscribed by the public. The resumption of the Central Bank's reverse repurchase facility in November also helped to stabilise the market and arrest any undue rise in interest rates. Open market operations continued to be the mechanism for liquidity management, with the repo rate and the rediscount rates being used as the main means of influencing the market. Although the Central Bank's own Securities, with a maturity of seven days, were available, use of the facility by commercial banks was minimal. In the domestic foreign exchange market, the Central Bank's middle rate for transactions with commercial banks depreciated by about 10 per cent. The slightly higher repo rates in 1998 than in 1997, served to contain the demand for funds from the call market for the purchase of foreign exchange.",

However, government expenditure increased and revenues were less than budgeted, partly due to the GST rate being lower than the revenue neutral rate. This led to an additional financing requirement. Hence, the government reissued this Rs.2,000 million of Treasury bills and a further Rs.5,000 million, from the bills retired in 1997. In order to avoid disrupting the market through these issues, they were taken up by the Central Bank.

In addition, the spread between the Central Bank's 3-month discount and rediscount rates for Treasury bills was also adjusted to influence the liquidity conditions in the market. The margin was raised in two steps, from 3.25 to 4.25 percentage points, in January, to tighten monetary conditions and discourage commercial banks from selling Treasury bills to the Central Bank to obtain low cost liquidity for speculative activity in a volatile foreign exchange market. Some improvement in stability in the foreign exchange market was seen in February. Commercial banks stopped buying foreign currency from the Central Bank and the inter-bank exchange rate for the dollar appreciated in the first few weeks in February. The margin between the discount rate and rediscount rate was therefore reduced to 4.00 percentage points on 20 February. The margin was adjusted several times during the year and stood at 3.15 percentage points from mid August to end December 1998. When the year is considered as a whole, the general increase in interest rates of about 2 percentage points can be seen in the Central Bank's secondary window too. The discount and rediscount rates for 3-month bills rose to 11.86 per cent and 15.01 per cent, respectively, at end 1998 from 9.72 per cent and 12.97 per cent, respectively, at end 1997.",

The considerable uncertainty created in the foreign exchange market due to the crisis in East Asia in the latter half of 1997, continued into 1998, leading to speculative activity in the Sri Lanka foreign exchange markets. In order to discourage this, and in view of the increase in inflation early in 1998, the overnight repo rate was raised from 11.0 per cent at end 1997 to 12.00 per cent in January and kept at a relatively high level throughout most of the year, to avoid portfolio shifts from domestic assets to foreign assets.

Structural weaknesses in the market and limits on the amount of liquidity provided made this facility less effective than envisaged. Its use was gradually abandoned and the facility was not offered in 1996 or in 1997. In fact, the availability of liquidity in the market in 1997 obviated the need for such a facility. The Central Bank reintroduced the reverse repurchase facility with effect from 09 November 1998, in order to stabilise the short-term rates in the money market. All commercial banks and non commercial bank Primary Dealers for government securities are eligible to make use of this facility. At present, only overnight funds are provided under this facility. There is no limit on the amount of liquidity that can be obtained, but such funds are provided only against the collateral of Treasury bills or Treasury bonds. The reverse repo rate is determined by the Bank on a daily basis and is announced to the market. Currently, this rate is equivalent to the rediscount rate at the Bank's secondary window. There were only two reverse repurchase transactions recorded, i.e., on 27 November and 01 December, amounting to Rs.731 million and Rs.334 million, respectively, at the rate of 15.45 per cent.",

The Commonwealth Development Corporation and the International Finance Corporation were major institutional investors. A notable development in the debt securities market was seen during the year. There were seven debenture issues by 6 companies viz., Ceylinco Securities and Financial Services Ltd., Hatton National Bank Ltd., Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. (two issues), Ceylon Glass Co. Ltd., Seylan Bank Ltd. and Vanik Incorporation Ltd. The maturity period of these issues varied from 3-5 years, while they carried interest rates ranging from 13.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Although most issues had fixed rates of interest, two were offered with floating rates. However, interest rate variability has been limited by prescribing a minimum interest rate of 12.74 per cent per annum and a maximum interest rate of 16 per cent per annum. All the issues were over-subscribed and the total amount raised through these issues was Rs.2,668 million. The issues have been listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, the National Savings Bank (NSB) and Bank of Ceylon (BoC) entered into an agreement during December 1998 under which BoC issued ten-year debentures worth Rs.l billion to the NSB.",

The Plantation sector was the biggest loser as prices decreased by 45.6 per cent. This was mainly attributed to the Russian crisis. Among the other sectors which had significant decreases in prices were Footwear and Textiles, Investment Trusts, Banks, Finance and Insurance, Chemical and Pharmaceuticals, Motors and Manufacturing. The Stores and Supplies sector achieved the highest growth in prices, recording an increase of 31.7 per cent. The Oil Palms, Services and Beverage, Food and Tobacco sectors also recorded decreases in prices during the year.",

With the objective of developing the debt market, the 1998 Budget exempted from income tax, the capital gains and profits on the sale of listed debentures. Proposals were made in the 1999 Budget to develop the secondary market for debt in order to give both listed companies and investors sufficient manoeuvrability to hedge their positions and encourage market development. Proposals were made to remove the withholding tax of 10 per cent levied on interest paid on listed debentures and debt securities and the stamp duty on the issue of listed debt instruments such as debentures and promissory notes.

According to current SEC. regulations, the buyer is required to make payment before the sixth day after the transaction and the seller's dues will be settled before seven days. In case a broker fails to pay the dues, the Fund will clear the defaulted trade. The defaulting broker will be suspended from business until he clears the amount paid by the Fund, together with any penalties.

Therefore, the settlement period was effectively trading day plus 15 market days. According to the new directives, the grace period has been reduced to 3 days and the settlement period is equal to the trading day plus 8 days.

Another major development in the Treasury bond market was the introduction of \"Jumbo\" issues at the Treasury bond auctions with a view to building up a large securities reserve, creating a highly liquid secondary market and lowering the government's borrowing cost. In these 'Jumbo' issues, a decision is taken to issue a large block of bonds of a specific series; smaller portions of this block are offered to the market at various auctions, subject to the government's borrowing requirements and liquidity situation in the market. There were 17 series of bonds, comprising 11 series for 2-year bonds (29 issues), 4 series for 3-year bonds (14 issues) and 2 series for 4-year bonds (9 issues) during the year. The coupon rates for maturities of 2-year, 3-year and 4-year Treasury bonds were 11.00 per cent per annum, 11.50 per cent per annum and 12.00 per cent per annum, respectively. All auctions were fully subscribed. As with other interest rates, an upward movement was also seen in Treasury bond yields.",

With the gradual increase in short-term rates, some uncertainty was generated in the market, leading to a decline in the degree of over\u00adsubscription and a rise in yield rates. Investors showed some caution in investing in medium-term bonds, despite there being liquidity in the market. However, all auctions were fully subscribed. The degree of over-subscription increased towards the end of the year, particularly in the last two months of 1998, reflecting improved liquidity during the period.",
