    "text": "Sri Lanka's balance of payments showed a further reduction in the trade and current account deficits and a surplus in the overall balance in 1998. In line with a sharp contraction of world exports, the growth rate of Sri Lanka's exports also decelerated to 2 per cent. Despite an increase, in the import volume, the value of imports increased marginally (0.5 per cent) as prices of major import commodities such as crude oil, wheat, fertiliser and sugar declined sharply under depressed world market conditions. Thus, the trade deficit declined in 1998. The services account continued to register a surplus, though somewhat lower than in the previous year. In addition to the compensation payments of US dollars 78 million, received on account of the Sri Lankan workers displaced from Kuwait by the Gulf war in 1990, private transfers continued to increase, making a positive contribution to the balance of payments. Consequently, there was a further significant reduction in the current account deficit in 1998. Foreign long-term private capital inflows continued to increase while there was a net outflow of short-term capital through the share market. Meanwhile, the rupee depreciated by nearly 10 per cent against the US dollar, a faster rate compared to the previous five-year average of around 6 per cent. Sri Lanka's exchange and money markets remained relatively stable, as domestic monetary and exchange rate policy was effective in maintaining financial market stability. A lower trade deficit, a considerably lower current account deficit, a surplus in the balance of payments and a stable foreign exchange market were the highlights of external sector developments in 1998.",

    "text": "The external sector developments displayed Sri Lanka's ability to withstand external shocks to a certain extent, but the adverse impact of the depressed world market conditions was being felt seriously during the second half of 1998. Export growth, which was around 8 per cent during the first half, declined to 2 per cent by the end of the year. Imports increased by one half of one per cent in 1998. The slow down in imports was mainly the outcome of low world commodity prices. The noteworthy increases in the volume of imports, particularly in investment goods, during the first few months of 1998, reflected the response by investors to fiscal incentives proposed in the 1998 Budget. However, a gradual slow down has been noticed since then. Meanwhile, the terms of trade improved by 14 per cent due both to higher export prices and lower import prices. Consequent to these developments in external trade, the trade deficit narrowed from 8.1 per cent of GDP in 1997 to 7.2 per cent in 1998.",

In view of the uncertainty in the capital markets, a further sale of Telecom shares was deferred until 1999. Net short-term private capital outflows showed a reduction in net short-term liabilities of commercial banks by US dollars 48 million, an outflow of US dollars 24 million through the share market and a small increase in other short-term private capital inflows. It is noteworthy that long-term private capital inflows, including foreign direct investment, continued to increase in 1998, reflecting the growing foreign investor confidence in Sri Lanka's medium-term development strategy. Over half the FDI inflows of US dollars 150 million were to the telecommunication sector, with significant inflows to the energy and manufacturing sectors as well. Investment outflows to approved projects amounted to around US dollars 13 million. Long-term concessional capital inflows to the government increased during the year. Net capital inflows to government declined by 17 per cent as a result of a drop in non-concessional capital inflows and somewhat higher amortisation payments.",

This was because FCBUs were expected to undertake mainly off-shore transactions, while also catering to companies operating in Export Processing Zones under Section 17 of the Board of Investment (BOI) Law, which were predominantly foreign owned, at that time. This treatment was reconsidered in the context of increasing transactions over time between FCBUs and the domestic economy. It was felt that it was timely to treat FCBUs as resident enterprises and make the corresponding changes to the monetary and balance of payments statistics.",

(It should be noted that BOI enterprises have always been treated as residents in the compilation of balance of payments statistics). Nearly 70 per cent of the assets of FCBUs at end 1998 represented their claims on resident enterprises, as compared with about 30 per cent on non-resident enterprises. This is in contrast to the situation in the early 1980s. In 1985, 62 per cent of the assets of FCBUs wore claims on non-residents. tc) Most FCBU transactions are undertaken by-domestic commercial banks. Accordingly, at end 1998, 66 per cent of the assets, representing their lending to resident enterprises, were held by the FCBUs of domestic banks while the balance 34 per cent were held by the FCBUs of foreign banks operating in Sri Lanka. (d) FCBUs mobilise a larger part of their resources from the domestic economic system, in the form of domestic banking unit (DBU) placements of their foreign currency deposits in FCBUs and deposits belonging to other resident enterprises, mainly BOI firms. Placements of foreign exchange funds by DBUs, mainly funds in Non-Resident Foreign Currency (NRFC) accounts, provide nearly 30 per cent of FCBU resources. (Over 50 per cent of NRFC accounts, themselves are held by residents.) A larger part of the remaining FCBU resources was in the form of deposits belonging to BOI enterprises.",

    "text": "(e) Increasingly, a large number of domestically owned enterprises or domestic-foreign collaborations are registering as BOI enterprises and are becoming eligible for FCBU facilities, thus leading to increased integration of FCBUs with the domestic economy. FCBU dealings with non-residents accounted for only about 30 per cent of total FCBU transactions at end 1998. In view of the foregoing, it is appropriate to include only the transactions of FCBUs with non\u00adresidents in the balance of payments statistics, and to exclude transactions of FCBUs with residents. The following are the implications of this definitional change on the balance of payments and other external sector economic indicators (Table 1). (a) Income Account: Changes stem from changes in interest receipts and payments by commercial banks and the private sector. Interest receipts and interest payments by commercial banks rise, as both foreign assets and foreign liabilities of commercial banks increase when FCBUs and DBUs are amalgamated. Interest receipts and payments by the non-bank private sector decrease as interest payments on borrowings from FCBUs by non-bank residents, mainly BOI enterprises, and interest receipts on deposits held with FCBUs by such residents arc excluded. The net outcome of these changes is a reduction in the deficit in the income account in 1998, and a corresponding decline in the current account deficit. (b) Financial Account: Changes stem mainly from the borrowings by BOI and non-BOI enterprises and the government from FCBUs being excluded and the new definition of the assets and liabilities of commercial banks to include both FCBUs and DBUs.",

In 1969 the classification of exports and imports was changed from the Standard International Trade Classification to the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature (BTN) which was introduced at that time1. This resulted in a delay in releasing the detailed data on exports and imports on monthly basis by the Sri Lanka Customs, and publication of the monthly indices was abandoned2.

This situation was the result of slow growth in textiles and garments and tea, and the negative growth in natural rubber and some of the rubber based products, coconut products, gems, diamonds and jewellery.

Earnings from the single largest export item, i.e., textile and garments, which began to slow down in late 1997, showed a recovery towards July 1998 but again slowed down thereafter. Tea prices, which remained buoyant till July 1998, came down during the last quarter of the year mainly due to world production surpluses and the Russian crisis that began in mid August. Although slowed down, textiles and garments, tea, minor agricultural products, food beverages and tobacco and travel goods showed positive growth, but their impact on overall export performance was negated by the negative growth in earnings from rubber, coconut products, gems, diamonds and jewellery.",

The primary objective is the promotion of long-run economic growth and development of a country by removing barriers to trade with the preferred trading partner. The removal could take place immediately or gradually over a period of time. An agreement could exclude some tradable products on the basis of concerns such as the potential injury to important domestic industries due to the removal of trade barriers, and also for national security reasons. Lists of those excluded items are called 'negative lists'. Those items on negative lists do not receive concessions but are traded subject to normal terms of trade. Since the purpose of a preferential trade agreement is the promotion of the countries' own products, the agreement specifies rules of origin criteria. Thus, to receive concessions, a product should either be wholly obtained in a country or go through a substantial transformation within a country if it contains any material imported from a third party country. The required degree of transformation is specified under the rules of origin criteria in the agreement.",

Thus, developing countries should;;; seek each others co-operation in promoting exports and economic growth. India, being a large economy and a market with a significantly large group of middle income earners, could provide opportunities for the expansion of Sri Lanka's exports by offering preferential tariffs to Sri Lanka.",

The ability to derive the benefits depends on the relative efficiency of procedures relating to trade and investment in Sri Lanka, the degree of infrastructure development including port services and road networks, and India's willingness to accept and facilitate raw material imports and finished goods exports by Sri Lanka. The lower tariff structure in Sri Lanka and non-exislence of para-tariff and non-tariff barriers will be advantageous. However, infrastructure facilities will have to be further developed for Sri Lanka to remain competitive and efficient to attract foreign investment. In this regard government institutions could play a larger role together with private sector participation. Many infrastructure products such as roads are public goods. They play an eminent role in the acceleration of long-run growth. Public goods, similar to private goods, should also be planned, produced and delivered efficiently and on time, and this process requires entrepreneurial capabilities.",

This share dropped to 12 per cent in 1998 due to a temporary interruption to production of examination gloves in a single firm that underwent a transition in production technology. The production of examination gloves recommenced with the operation of new machines in November 1998. However, earnings from other rubber based products collectively increased by 13 per cent due to higher earnings from tyres and tubes, non-surgical gloves, floor covering and mats, rubber bands and other rubber products.

The USA and UK markets for precious and semi-* precious stones have been stable for low value products. On the supply side, the problems that the Gem and Jewellery Authority had with the plantation companies relating to sharing proceeds from auctions of the leases of land for gem mining were resolved in March 1998. As a result, legal mining increased. However, illegal mining was still high due to the problems associated with leasing state lands for mining.

This was a lower surplus compared to US dollars 159 million 1998, and reflected the slowing down in the port-related services. Net receipts from transportation services dropped by 12 per cent in 1998 owing to a marginal increase in receipts (3 per cent) against a faster growth (13 per cent) in payments. Slow growth in import and export trade and a decline in transshipment cargo handled led to a slower growth in receipts from port related services, while increased freight charges were partly responsible for higher payments in transportation services. Tourist arrivals during the early months of 1998 were affected due to both the uncertain security situation arising from terrorist attacks in February and March and the depressed global economic conditions, particularly in the East Asian region. Competition from countries in the East Asian region also had an impact on tourist arrivals during the year. However, tourist arrivals reflected a recovery in the last quarter of the year with a significant increase of 16 per cent. This contributed to an overall growth of 4 per cent in 1998, resulting in a 10 per cent growth in receipts from travel. Travel payments rose by 12 per cent, leading to a marginal drop in net travel receipts. This was due to an increased number of Sri Lankans travelling to cheaper destinations in the Asian region for pleasure, as well as business purposes.",

Imports of wheat and meslin and wheat and meslin flour continued to remain under licence control in 1998 in order to fulfil the contractual obligations between the government and Prima Ceylon Ltd., a milling company. Some restrictions that had existed hitherto were relaxed, including the enhancement of the upper limit on advance payment for imports, from US dollars 3,000 to US dollars 7,500, by way of amendments made to the Import and Export Control Act No. 1 of 1969, with effect from 8 April 1998. During the year, selected parts of motor vehicles were brought under import licence. The licence requirement on three year of age diesel engines of cubic capacity less than 3,250 was revised to five year old engines. Importers had been required to obtain licences for imports of vehicles over 5 years old in the past. However, certain categories of motor vehicles less than 7 years of age, used for goods transportation, were permitted to be imported without licence requirement for a period of four and a half months from 17 November 1998. This decision is not in keeping with the present policy direction as it amounts to an ad hoc policy change. In summary, about 300 items out of about 6,000 items at the 6 digit level of the Harmonised System Code (HSC) remained under import licence at end 1998.",

In this context, the Presidential Trade and Tariff Commission (PTTC), which was appointed by the government in 1997 to study and recommend appropriate changes to the tariff structure, made its recommendations in July 1998. The PTTC recommended reduction of the prevailing tariffs and a move towards a two band tariff system in two stages. In line with these recommendations, the three band tariff system with 10, 20 and 35 per cent rates for imports, which had been effective since February 1995, was replaced with a three band tariff system of 5, 10 and 30 per cent with effect from 6 November 1998. All industrial raw material and machinery not manufactured in Sri Lanka are classified under the 5 per cent band. Further consolidation of the tariff structure to a two band system is expected to commence in the year 2000.",

However, to safeguard government revenue targets, an excise duty of 10 per cent was levied. Import duty on crude oil and petroleum products, which had remained outside the three band system since 6 November 1997, was increased from 25 per cent to the upper rate of 30 per cent. To simplify the procedures involved, concessions extended to transport, communication and medical equipment were classified under a zero rate of duty.

Immediately after the allocation of performance quota, the remaining quota were allocated under the main pool quota scheme on a pro rata basis of number of employees, and preference was given to exporters to non quota countries and exporters of non quota items to quota countries. The under-utilised categories in the previous year were declared as 'cold' categories and allocated on the condition that shipment would be made within seven working days. The various schemes that have evolved under pool quota systems reflect cumbersome procedures that require close supervision and monitoring to achieve maximum utilisation.

Until quotas are fully phased out in 2005 under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, optimal utilisation of quotas needs to be ensured to reap the full potential benefits under the existing framework. Hence, the quota administration needs to be done efficiently. Although market based quota distribution through auctioning of quotas would have produced better results in terms of quota utilisation, various other objectives, such as the need to promote new investments, regionalise industries and generate more empIoymenL have entered into the quota administration in Sri Lanka. Although a fundamental change in the quota allocation system may not be necessary, it should be the responsibility of quota administrators to ensure the smooth functioning of the system, so that the growth of the textiles and garments industry and trade will not be interrupted. This is all the more important as the global competition among suppliers has intensified in the context of depressed world market conditions and there needs to be smooth transition to face more intense competition in a quota-free trading environment after 2005.",

The year 1998 was a particularly difficult year for Sri Lankan exporters as they were hit by the East Asian and Russian currency crises. The SLECIC launched a special insurance policy covering tea exports to Russia on 15 October 1998, at the request of the Ministry of Finance and at the initiative of the Sri Lanka Tea Board. The special cover was for a period of 4 months and was limited to 75 per cent of the loss with a maximum limit of US dollar 15 million. However, the SLECIC issued only 4 policies for a total value of US dollar 2.7 million under this scheme. The SLECIC provided several schemes of guarantees to commercial banks against default risk on financial facilities granted to exporters. Those schemes helped exporters to obtain necessary financing on time. In 1998, the SLECIC issued a total of 66 guarantees for a total value of Rs. 142.8 million for pre-shipment credit, post-shipment credit, export production credit and export performance guarantees. The SLECIC continued to issue direct guarantees to assist gems and jewellery exporters participating in trade fairs and exhibitions abroad, under the \"Admission Temporarie Admission\"(ATA Carnet) system. Under this scheme, exporters were assisted to obtain a standard certificate, which is a temporary admission permit issued by the Sri Lanka National Council of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) without any collateral security, which permitted duty free access to foreign exhibitions.",

The share of exports receiving concessions from various countries is in the range of 7 per cent to 42 per cent. Exports to the USA received the lowest concessions, while exports to Canada received the highest concessions. This generally low share of exports receiving concessions may be due to various safeguard measures adopted by importing countries and the lack of awareness by Sri Lankan exporters of the GSP scheme. Sri Lanka could improve the share of exports receiving preferential treatment under the GSP by obtaining further concessions on the local content requirement in the rules of origin criteria. In this connection, SAARC as a grouping could lobby to receive special concessions for its members on the local content requirement under the 'cumulative rules of origin' criteria for the grouping. Under these criteria, material imported from SAARC member countries and used in production in any other member country could be considered 'local material' in deciding the local content requirement. The Commerce Department of Sri Lanka has already taken initiatives on obtaining the cumulative rules of origin concessions and popularising the scheme among exporters.",

This drop was due to the favorable prices that prevailed in 1998 for big onions. Thus, the CWE did not have to intervene to support producers. Local purchases of dried chillies too declined in 1998 due to a poor harvest and reasonably high prices realised by the farmers. The quantity purchased in 1998 was 90 metric tons compared to 1,797 metric tons in 1997. The lower local purchases resulted from the lower domestic production of sugar. In 1998, the CWE purchased 650 metric tons of sugar due mainly to low domestic production.

In 1998, the quantities imported were comparable to the quantities imported in 1997, after providing allowances for the better local rice harvest, and restrictions imposed by major exporting countries (India and Pakistan) on big onion exports due to poor harvests in those countries.

The satisfactory performance could be attributed to the introduction of mobile sales to franchise shops and the appointment of 260 new dealers and 18 super franchise dealers in 1998. The CWE ventured into opening franchise shops abroad in 1998 to popularise Sri Lankan produce and as a part of their profit making strategy. The first dealer has been appointed in Australia, and appointment of dealers in a few selected countries will follow in 1999.",

Charter flights brought in 11 per cent of the total (42,755 arrivals) compared to 5 per cent (19,555 arrivals) in 1997, an increase of 119 percent. The increase is partly due to the suspension of its activities in Sri Lanka by British Airways in March 1998, as evidenced by a doubling of arrivals from the UK by charters. Arrivals by charters from other countries, accounting for 66 per cent of the total charter arrivals in 1998, also grew by 101 per cent. As charters play a vital role in developing leisure destinations, efforts should be taken to increase charter flights into Sri Lanka.",

In 1998, the Department signed seven bilateral agreements including those with the UK, Australia and France, to increase the frequency of flights per week and the seating capacity. Two charters were registered with the Department in 1998, one from Italy and the other from France, thus increasing the number of charters operated as at end 1998 to nine. The increase in flying capacity, particularly from Western European countries, will be favourable for the industry. The expected fleet expansion of Air Lanka Ltd in 1999 will also have a beneficial effect on tourist arrivals.",

Re-enforcing the potential for novel aspects of pleasure tourism, such as eco-tourism and culture tourism, the revenue from foreign visitors who visited wild life parks, botanical gardens, zoological gardens and the cultural triangle continued to increase in 1998. The Department of National Zoological Gardens commenced preliminary work in 1998 on the proposed open modern zoo, which is to be established adjacent to the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage on an extent of 38 acres, at an estimated cost of Rs.30 million. In order to provide tourists with greater access to Sri Lanka's culture and arts, the Tourist Board commenced work on the establishment of a National Arts and Cultural Centre in Colombo Fort in 1998. The Sri Lanka Convention Bureau continued to promote Meetings, Incentive travel, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) tourism in 1998. The Bureau sponsored 8 conferences and exhibitions in 1998 and had 1,925 tourists visiting the country under the MICE category. The Bureau participated in several international campaigns to promote Sri Lanka as the latest destination for MICE tourism in the Asia. However, incidents of crime, tourist harrassment and pollution of beaches will seriously undermine the efforts of these ambitious projects.",
