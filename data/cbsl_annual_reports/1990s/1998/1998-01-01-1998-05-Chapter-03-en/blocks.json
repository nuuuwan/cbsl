    "text": "The overall agricultural output grew by 2.5 per cent in 1998. This followed a 3 per cent growth in 1997. An increase in paddy output by 20 per cent and a record high production in tea contributed to this growth of agricultural output. An increase in the extents sown, as well as an improvement in the yield, contributed to the increase in paddy output. Tea production during the year recorded a new high level with a further 1 per cent improvement, following a continuous increase over the last five years. Tea prices remained buoyant during the first half of the year. During the latter part of the year, prices started declining with the Russian rouble crisis and the substantial increase in world tea output, mainly in Kenya. Rubber production declined by 9 per cent, mainly due to unattractive prices, while coconut production also declined by 3 per cent due to the lagged effect of the El nino phenomenon experienced in 1997. Production of other export crops showed a considerable improvement with pepper, cocoa, coffee, cardamom, nutmeg and cinnamon oil recording increased outputs. These crops benefited from favourable prices. Of the other field crops, output of black gram, green gram, cowpea and soya bean increased, while high value crops such as chillies, red onions, big onions and potatoes declined to very low levels as the local high cost producers could not compete with imports from India and Pakistan after the complete liberalisation of trade policy relating to agricultural commodities. Fish production during the year increased by 8 per cent, particularly due to an improvement in the inland fisheries sector. The livestock sector also showed an improvement in 1998.",

This has not happened in Sri Lanka, especially in the domestic agricultural sector, where state intervention has been very high. The real incomes of paddy farmers have declined over the years. The producer price of paddy had increased at a lower rate than the increase in general consumer prices and the cost of agricultural inputs including labour. Some paddy sector workers have experienced real wage decreases by 1 - 2 per cent during the last 5 to 6 years. This has resulted in a migration of labour out of agriculture. However, a corresponding improvement in agricultural productivity has not occurred. Instead, the large number of females migrating out of the country for employment has affected certain agricultural activities such as transplanting, weeding and harvesting, leading to low productivity. The migration of labour out of the country has also led to wage increases in the sector, resulting in the country becoming a high cost producer of paddy and other agricultural commodities and thus reducing the competitiveness of some agricultural commodities.

For mechanisation to take place in agriculture, commercially oriented private sector participation is essential. A major constraint to this type of development is the excessive fragmentation of agricultural lands. At present, more than 90 per cent of the paddy holdings are less than two hectares in size. Mechanised cultivation in such small parcels of land is not economically viable. To encourage mechanised agriculture, a land consolidation programme would need to be initiated. Consolidation of small plots into contiguous holdings of a viable size would make economic sense and increase efficiency and output, thereby improving the quality of life of the small farmers. In pursuance of this policy, a pilot project in land consolidation implemented since 1997 in the Ridibendiela and Chandrika wewa irrigation schemes continued through 1998. The trade policy relating to agriculture products had also not been transparent until the quantitative controls (licensing requirement) were eliminated for potatoes, onions and chillies. The policy had been to bring in import controls off and on through the licensing mechanism to over protect farmers at the expense of the large majority of consumers. This had been done away with and the agriculture sector is given protection through tariffs, keeping the tariffs at the maximum rate under the current tariff structure. Incentives were given in the 1998 Budget to encourage seed production. It has been clearly recognised that improved seed varieties will have to be used either through improved local products or through imports to encourage agricultural productivity.",

Unattractive prices also led to the abandoning of tapping in certain rubber lands and discouraged the application of fertiliser, thereby reducing the yield levels further.",

The release of a large quantity of buffer stocks held by the USA and larger depreciations in 1997 of the currencies of the major rubber producing countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia (which account for 72 per cent of the global natural rubber production) triggered the decline in prices. The price decline was further aggravated by the release of natural rubber stocks by the Thai government in early 1998. The prices of synthetic rubber, which is a close substitute for natural rubber, also declined sharply owing to the drop in petroleum prices and contributed to the decline of the price of natural rubber. The recession in East Asia has led to a large reduction in the demand for vehicles in these countries. The major portion of the demand for natural rubber is a",

Replanting and new planting subsidies are financed through the funds generated by the cess collection. The replanting subsidy has played a vital role and acted as a catalyst in encouraging the replanting of rubber. Almost all the rubber smallholders have either availed themselves of the replanting or the new planting subsidy to establish their rubber stands. Hence the continuation of these subsidy schemes is very important. Therefore, even in the absence of a cess collection, the replanting and new planting subsidy programmes should be continued to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry. Inter cropping of rubber land with short-term crops such as passion fruit and pineapple would enhance the rubber growers' income during the gestation period of rubber cultivation.",

India's average yield level is about 50 per cent higher than that of Sri Lanka due to the high use of rain guards and proper management. The low yield levels are associated with the abandoning of fertiliser application, particularly by smallholders. A recently conducted sample survey of smallholders by the Central Bank in the Ratnapura and Kalutara Districts revealed that the regular application of fertiliser has helped some of the smallholders to remain viable even after the recent decline in prices.",

However, in US dollars, the export price declined by 9 per cent in 1998. A substantial decline of 25 per cent (in rupee terms) was observed in kernel product exports. The fall in nut production, coupled with devaluation of currencies in the East Asian region, had a marked impact on the export performance. The export price of major coconut products such as DC and copra remained at low levels in 1998 consequent on the devaluation of currencies in the major coconut exporting countries, viz., the Philippines and Indonesia.

The cess on DC exports was increased from Rs.1.00 per kg. to Rs.2.00 per kg. with effect from 1 March 1998 for a three year period ending 1 March 2001. The upward revision of the cess on DC was to mobilise adequate financial support for the new joint venture company (MPCL). The total cess collection in 1998 was about Rs.147 million, a 34 per cent increase over the previous year. During the year, the CCB utilised some of these cess funds to continue its support programmes such as new planting (Rs.13.5 million), re-planting (Rs.10 million), home garden (Rs.15 million) and the 'Kapruka Ayojana' Credit Scheme (Rs. 8 million) to develop coconut lands.",

The average cost of production (COP) of paddy has risen over the years owing to the increased costs of inputs, especially labour wages, tractor hiring fees and agro-chemicals. This has made the cultivation of paddy in certain districts, especially in the Wet Zone, unremunerative. The government has recognised this problem and made a special allocation for the Department of Agriculture in the 1998 Budget to identify such areas, conduct research and make recommendations to persuade these paddy farmers to diversify into other food crops.",

However, relatively low yields, low sugar recovery rates and frequent labour problems have affected the industry somewhat. The situation has been further aggravated by the sharp decline in international prices which led to an erosion of the financial viability of the industry. The faster depreciation of the rupee in 1998, and the government taxes on sugar imports kept the sugar prices from falling, in spite of a large decline in international prices. Any fiscal incentive to improve the financial viability of the industry could have been possible only by burdening the consumer.",

The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development has implemented a number of development programmes and projects, in particular to modernise sectoral infrastructure and to rationalise the management of fisheries resources. The period 1997/98 has been characterised by a series of structural reforms to improve the economic efficiency of the fisheries sector. These reforms mainly focused on the pursuit of sustainable exploitation of aquatic resources, improvement in the quality of fish and enhancement of the living standards of the fishing community.",

The available estimates indicate a 2 per cent increase in cow milk production, from 252 million litres in 1997 to 256 million litres in 1998. The production of buffalo milk increased by 8 per cent, from 79 million litres in 1997 to 85 million litres in 1998. Kiriya Milk Industries Ltd. (formerly Milk Industries of Lanka Company Ltd.) accounted for the largest share in national milk collection. Despite the increase in milk production, milk collection by Kiriya Milk Industries Ltd. and Nestle Lanka Ltd. decreased by 9 per cent and 15 per cent to 53 million litres and 29 million, respectively, during 1998. The decline in collection volumes was on account of the emphasis given to the production of good quality milk. In this regard, a price incentive scheme has been introduced to promote the quality of milk. For example, milk that contained either 4.8 per cent of milk fat and 8.3 per cent solid non fat (SNF) or 4 per cent milk fat and 8.5 per cent SNF was paid an additional 50 cents per litre.",

In spite of a decline in market prices for rubber, fertiliser issues to the rubber sector also increased by 33 per cent because the cost of fertiliser is counted as an integral part of the new planting/replanting subsidy package.
