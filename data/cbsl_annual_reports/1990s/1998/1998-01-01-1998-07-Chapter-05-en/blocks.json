    "text": "A lack of infrastructure facilities has been highlighted as one of the major factors that has affected the external competitiveness of Sri Lankan products and constrained faster economic expansion in Sri Lanka. Resource constraints caused by the continuing military conflict in the North and the East since 1983 curtailed the development of key economic infrastructure sectors to a large extent. Public investment had gradually declined as a percentage of GDP from 13 per cent in 1985 to 5 per cent in 1997, resulting in a sharp deterioration in the quality and adequacy of the infrastructure base. A further fall in public investment may have adverse implications on future growth prospects as the overall investment ratio has not been growing sufficiently to facilitate a growth rate of more than 5 per cent per year in the next five years. This trend has been arrested to some extent in 1998. The government strictly adhered to maintaining capital expenditure as planned in the 1998 Budget despite a shortfall in revenue and increased security expenditure. Accordingly, public investment increased to 5.9 per cent of GDP in 1998, a significant increase compared to 1997. The 1999 Budget envisaged a further increase in public investment to 7.5 per cent of GDP in 1999. Nevertheless, the current level of investment is still below the required level, considering the dilapidated condition of some of the existing infrastructure and future economic needs. In this context, private sector participation in providing economic infrastructure has to be further encouraged within a clear medium-term policy framework and a well designed regulatory mechanism.",

In addition, negotiations had been completed in respect of 165 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant on a BOOT basis and a 60 MW Barge Mounted Power Plant on a BOO basis during the year. Further, Kool Air Ventures (Pvt.) Ltd. installed a 10 MW Diesel Power Plant at Kankasanturai on a BOT basis in order to restore the power supply in the Jaffna Peninsula.

With the commissioning of new thermal power plants, the power generating capacity of thermal power plants grew by 4 per cent, reducing the reliance on hydro power to a level of 69 per cent in accordance with the policy statements made in 1998. The telecommunication sector grew rapidly, outpacing the growth of demand, and it is estimated that the waiting list for telephones will be eliminated by 2002. The total investment in the telecommunication sector, both private and public, amounted to Rs. 16,162 million in 1998. Consequently, the number of persons per telephone, including cellular and wireless phones, improved from 41 in 1997 to 27 in 1998. Efforts to maintain the national road network was strengthened considerably by the investment of a sum of Rs.5,783 million in 1998, an increase of 3 per cent over the previous year. Initial work on large road infrastructure projects such as the Matara - Colombo Expressway, Colombo - Katunayake Highway and the Outer Circular Road connecting major highways in Colombo, commenced in 1998.

    "text": "The number of government hospitals practising Western medicine increased to 550 with the opening of a Dental Teaching Hospital at Peradeniya and the acquisition of 2 estate hospitals in 1998. The number of hospital beds per 1,000 population improved to 2.9 from 2.8 in 1997. In addition, there were 389 central dispensaries by end 1998. The health sector manpower stands at 69,369, of which 5,104 were recruited during 1998. The number of doctors including Assistant Medical Practitioners (AMPs) and Interns, at 6,981, works out to 3.7 doctors per 10,000 people, up from 3.4 in 1997. Although the nursing staff has increased in absolute terms, the number of nurses per 10,000 population decreased to 7.7 from 7.8 in 1997. Inadequate nursing staff has been disturbing inpatient services in hospitals for a number of years. The private sector health care service also greatly suffers from a lack of qualified nurses. To address these issues, the government recruited 1,553 persons to nursing schools in 1998 to be trained as nurses. At the same time, the construction of a new nurses' training school at the Sri Jayawardenapura hospital also commenced in 1997. The shortage of qualified para-medical staff, both in government and private hospitals, hinders the effective treatment of patients. During 1998, only 42 para-medics were recruited to government hospitals. However, a record 1,100 persons have been enrolled for training during the year. Adoption of a long-term plan to train health personnel is required as the demand, particularly for nurses, para-medics and technicians, is growing fast.",

The 'Suva Udana' health service programme aimed at providing preventive and curative health services to underserved areas of the country through specialist services was held in ten areas during 1998. The National Immunisation Day for Polio Eradication was held for the fourth successive year. The country has already achieved its global target (90 per cent) of immunisation coverage of infants against six vaccine-preventable diseases. Meanwhile, dengue haemorrhagic feve showed an increase in incidence. During 1998 there were 227 confirmed dengue cases, compared to 193 confirmed cases in 1997. A Dengue Control and Preventive Week from 22 to 29 June 1998 was declared. The outbreak of cholera, which commenced in 1997, continued in 1998. The outbreak commenced in the Puttalam District and in 1998, most of the cases were reported from the Puttalam, Kurunegala, Moneragala and Polonnaruwa districts. The main reasons for the spread of cholera were lack of safe drinking water and sanitary facilities and poor personal hygiene. There was no significant change in the incidence of Japanese encephalitis during 1998. However, immunisation of children between 1-10 years against the disease was continued during the year. Despite the control activities undertaken, the incidnece of Malaria remained high. However, the number of Positive cases reported duting 1998 dropped marginally to 211,691.",

In relation to GDP, expenditure rose from 1.3 per cent in 1997 to 1.4 per cent in 1998. The capital expenditure of the government on the health sector at Rs. 4,330 million reflected an increase of 70 per cent. Construction work of the National Nurses Training School at Sri Jayawardenapura, at a cost of Rs.723 million, was in progress in 1998. Construction work is scheduled to be completed by mid-1999 and the first batch of 100 nursing students will be recruited during the same year. A ten-storied building complex with 390 beds for the Lady Ridgeway Hospital is under construction with financial assistance from China. The estimated total cost of the project is Rs.320 million and the construction work is scheduled to be completed by the end of August 1999. With Korean financial assistance, steps have been taken to improve the patient care services of the Gampaha and Negombo Base Hospitals at a cost of Rs.225 million and to provide basic medical equipment to peripheral hospitals at a cost of Rs.300 million in 1998. The Government of France has granted a soft loan of Rs.170 million for improving the cardio-thoracic unit at the Kandy Teaching Hospital. The IDA/World Bank funded Health Service Project, which commenced in 1997, continued in 1998. A large quantum of funds under the project has been allocated for malaria eradication (Rs.252 million), STD/AIDS (Rs.603 million), nutrition",

Introduction of new courses and increasing student teacher enrollments are among the major objectives of this effort. However, the enrollment for the courses conducted by the Teacher Training Schools indicates a decline, since the preference is for distance mode teacher training programmes conducted by the National Institute of Education (NIE). A programme for providing foreign training in various important areas of education for teachers, principals, teacher educators, education administrators and officers in the NIE has been implemented.",

The enrollment of both full time and part time students in post graduate courses was about 6,500. The Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) had an enrolment of about 19,500 students to follow its courses through the distance mode of education. About 91,000 students had registered for external degrees at the Kelaniya, Peradeniya, Sri Jayawardanapura, Ruhuna and Eastern universities. Several universities added new courses to their programmes during 1998. The OUSL introduced a degree programme in Primary Education.

Mobilising private sector resources for the development of university and technical education, as well as direct private participation in the provision of these services should be effectively encouraged. Formal links and staff and student exchange programmes with reputed foreign academic institutions/technical colleges would also help in strengthening educational reforms.

Hydro power, which accounted for 69 per cent of the total power generation, grew by 14 per cent compared with 6 per cent in the previous year. This was the highest growth recorded after 1993. Thermal power generation grew further by 18 per cent to meet the growing demand. Electricity generation from CEB sources rose by 15 per cent in 1998. Meanwhile, power generation by the IPPs grew sharply to 393 GWh. from a mere 17 GWh. in 1997 as the Lakdhanavi Power Plant (22.5 MW) commissioned at the end of 1997 was in operation throughout 1998 and the Asia Power Plant (51 MW) was in operation since its commissioning in May 1998. The Lakdhanavi power plant has the capacity to generate 168 GWh. per annum, while the Asia Power Plant is capable of generating 330 GWh. per annum. Meanwhile, the CEB allowed self-generation of electricity during March - June and again during December, as scheduled. The recorded self-generation of electricity during 1998 amounted to 108 GWh., which represents a 54 per cent drop when compared to 1997. The cost of thermal power generated by the CEB and by the hired power plants dropped sharply by 49 per cent to Rs.2,751 million, mainly due to the provision of fuel by the CPC at duty exempted prices from July 1997. Meanwhile, the cost of power purchases from IPPs amounted to Rs. 1,776 million due to an increase in the volume of power purchases in 1998. According to the power purchasing agreements, the CEB purchases a minimum guaranteed 168 GWh. of power per annum from the Lakdhanavi power plant and 330 GWh. of power per annum from the Asia Power Plant at a price determined by taking into account the financial charge/ capacity charge, an energy charge, an operating charge and taxes to be paid. The all inclusive annual average power purchasing price has been estimated at Rs.4.58 per KWh. in 1998 which is higher than the average tariff of Rs.4.47 per KWh. in 1998. However, this did not create a major problem for the CEB, as the overhead cost per unit of electricity generated declined in 1998 owing to almost full utilisation of low cost hydro power and an indirect subsidy to the CEB from the CPC in the form of duty exempted fuel supplies. However, the share of power purchases from other sources out of total electricity available with the CEB (about",

The average domestic tariff was Rs.3.11 in 1998 whereas the average cost, excluding interest payment, was Rs.3.50 per KWh. The average tariff rates of electricity for general purposes, at Rs.7.00 per KWh., was twice the average cost. For industrial purposes the tariff, at Rs.5.20 per KWh., was 49 per cent above the average cost. The actual cost of electricity generation has been rising on account of increasing reliance on thermal power. However, the need for another tariff increase in 1998 was averted as the government agreed to provide fuel to the CEB at duty exempted prices. The CEB further benefited as it was allowed to pass the GST to the consumers without adjusting the tariff for turnover tax which had been paid by the CEB. Primarily due to the reasons mentioned above, the average cost of producing a unit of electricity dropped substantially from Rs.4.50 in 1997 to Rs.3.50 in 1998. However, this type of implicit and non-transparent tariff changes will not bring a lasting solution to the existing weaknesses in the CEB tariff system. An explicit strategy, based on the economic cost of power generation, transmission and distribution, is needed to rationalise the tariff structure of the CEB.",

    "text": "Total electricity consumption of the country increased by about 12 per cent to 4,509 GWh. in 1998, mainly due to the expansion of the consumer base. Electricity sales to the domestic sector rose by about 13 per cent to 1,368 GWh., while the domestic sector consumer network, including those of Lanka Electricity Company Ltd. (LECO) also increased by 10 per cent to 2,053,833 during the year. (Of the total electricity sales, about 16 per cent was sold through LECO). This increase in the domestic consumer network was attributed mainly to the rapid expansion of rural electrification projects in recent years. The proportion of houses with electricity increased to about 52 per cent of the total houses in 1998. However, a recent survey by the CEB reveals that only about 36 per cent of the rural houses have electricity, compared to 95 per cent in the urban areas. While the rural electrification programmes are costly, there is an indirect benefit to society due to the increased availability of power. The cost could be reduced by developing renewable energy sources and thermal power sources at regional level, thereby reducing transmission and distribution losses. Meanwhile, electricity sales to the industrial sector, exclusive of self-generation, rose by about 13 per cent to 1,786 GWh., of which 174 GWh. was sold by LECO. The industrial consumer network, inclusive of those under LECO, grew by 5 per cent to 28,006 during the year under review. Electricity sales by the CEB to the general purpose category expanded by 10 per cent to 757 GWh., while sales by LECO to this category rose by 15 per cent to 118 GWh. The total general purpose consumer network expanded by 7 per cent to 252,016, of which 32,750 were under LECO.",

Meanwhile, despite the sharp drop in international prices, gas prices also remained unchanged. However, the total profit accruing to the CPC eroded to some extent due to the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar by 9.6 per cent during the year. In addition, the government absorbed part of this profit by imposing special levies on the CPC and increasing the duty on petroleum imports from 25 per cent to 30 per cent with effect from November 1998. The CPC also used a part of its profits to reduce its liabilities. According to provisional data, the CPC has posted a before tax net profit of Rs.6.6 billion against a Rs.407 million profit in 1997 and a Rs.3,657 million loss in 1996.

The increase was clearly seen in furnace oil sales, which grew by 48 per cent, primarily due to the heavy demand from the new thermal power plants. This led the CPC to restrict supplies of furnace oil for bunkering services. As a result, Lanka Marine Services Ltd. (LMS) could not meet the entire demand for furnace oil by ships calling at the Port of Colombo for bunkering, thus losing earnings of foreign exchange. Sales of furnace oil for bunkering services dropped by 15 per cent to 189, 000 metric tons and earnings dropped by 33 per cent to US dollars 16 million. Ships calling at the Port of Colombo for bunkering services have been decreasing owing to relatively higher prices charged for bunkering services at the Port of Colombo. The average price of fuel oil at Colombo was US dollars 86 per metric ton in 1998. At present, LMS, which is a subsidiary of the CPC, has a monopoly for the supply of bunker fuel. In view of the relatively higher fuel prices and insufficient supplies, there is a strong demand by shipping lines to liberalise bunker supplies at the Port of Colombo. In any event, it should be noted that a consistent policy should be adopted for providing bunker fuel at a competitive price to attract more ships for bunkering, as this would help many other economic activities.",

Industrial gas sales increased by 28 per cent to 31,179 metric tons during 1998. Conversion of petrol driven vehicles to LP gas is also partly responsible for the increase in the demand for LP gas. According to rough estimates, there are some 5,000 vehicles converted by reputed companies so far to run on LP gas and the number is on the increase. Therefore, it is now necessary to introduce regulations and procedures in order to monitor this industry and to ensure the safety standards of these conversions.",

There are several other factors, such as the resistance that has to be faced in acquiring lands for building of new roads or widening the existing roads, the waste of funds due to the lack of co\u00adordination among highway authorities and utility agencies and financial constraints faced by contractors, that delay the completion of some projects. At the local and the provincial levels, the improvement of the road network is long overdue. As most of the provincial roads are not designed or built according to accepted engineering standards, the increasing number of vehicles, particularly heavy vehicles, cause damage to these roads. Resource constraints have been the major problem for the rehabilitation of these roads.",

A number of foreign funded road development projects were in progress under the RDA during this year. Almost all of these projects have been designed with the view to improving the quality of national highways. The Third Road Rehabilitation Project for the rehabilitation of 397 kms. of roads and construction of 19 bridges in the Southern, Western and North Western provinces was in progress with World Bank assistance during the year. The work on most contracts had been completed. The Third Road Rehabilitation and Improvement Project with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was also in progress. Under this project, rehabilitation of a total of 82 kms. on the Narammala-Giriulla, Kurunegala-Padeniya, Katugastota-Matale, Wattegama-Matale, Peradeniya-Gampola and Kandy-Tennekumbura roads is nearing completion. The Katunayake-Puttalam road is also being rehabilitated/ improved at a cost of Rs. 1,084 million under the same project. The total value of the work completed under this project in 1998 was Rs. 753 million. Phase II of the Sri Lanka-Japan Friendship Bridge is also being constructed with assistance from the OECF and is scheduled to be completed by 2000. Work on the Baseline Road Rehabilitation Project (Phase I) was in progress, with assistance from the OECF. Under this project, a dual 3 lane causeway is being constructed from the Kelanitissa roundabout to the Kanatta roundabout with a flyover across the main line railway at Dematagoda and a pedestrian subway at Borella. The work on the balance section from the Kanatta roundabout to the High Level Road will commence in 1999. The total cost of the project has been estimated as Rs. 1,530 million, of which Rs. 457 million was incurred in 1998.",

In the provinces, a total of 11,242 buses were in operation (except in the Northern and Eastern Provinces) as at end 1998. This indicated an increase of 19 per cent, as compared to 1997. The total seating capacity of these private buses also increased significantly by 29 per cent in 1998. The total number of permits issued by the Provincial Councils increased by 17 per cent. The number of routes allocated to the private sector at provincial level increased to 1,446 in 1998 from 1,335 in 1997. However, the number of bus owners has increased significantly from 9,432 in 1997 to 10,922 in 1998, reversing the trend of gradual transformation of the single owners to fleet owners observed in the previous year. This could have an adverse impact on cost effectiveness as well as on the monitoring of the private bus industry. The number of direct employment opportunities in this sector at provincial level has been estimated as around 27,000 in 1998. Meanwhile, the total number of new registrations of passenger transport buses at the DMT by RTCs and private operators increased by 60 per cent to 3,190 in 1998.",

Steps have been taken by the NTC with the help of provincial authorities to operate buses on common schedules for private operators and the RTCs, using common terminals. The work on phasing out the existing low roof buses was also in progress. The NTC continued its islandwide programme to train private bus crews in collaboration with the SLCTB Driver Training Schools and with assistance from the World Bank. As at end 1998, a total of 6,266 drivers and 8,529 conductors had been trained under this programme. In addition, another 10,000 bus crews attached to the RTCs will also be trained. The main objective of this programme has been to enhance productivity, improve service and enhance road discipline in passenger transportation. A programme for educating bus owners has been successfully completed in the Southern Province. Provision of private bus accident relief, issuance of permits to inter-provincial and intra-provincial buses and provision of financial support for rural bus services (Rs. 212 million) are among the other activities carried out by the NTC during 1998. The NTC has also proposed the setting up of a Central Bus Information System on countrywide bus operations, with the assistance of the World Bank.",

The need for setting up private bus companies with a minimum fleet of 50 buses, with a view to improving the productivity and to ease the monitoring procedures has also been emphasised. However, the main problem in the bus (as well as railway) transportation system has been the control of bus fares at non-remunerative level. This has hindered the development of the sector through private participation. Without addressing this basic issue, increasing the size of the public sector in bus transportation will be a reversal of policies.",

This trend has led to heavy congestion in city centres, particularly during peak hours. As a part of this trend, the number of vehicles, such as school vans, motor cycles and three wheelers in city centres is rapidly increasing. Although this trend has a positive impact on the economy through increasing economic activities and providing employment, the regulatory network has not been sufficiently developed to prevent unnecessary road congestion, and more importantly, to ensure the safety of passengers travelling by these vehicles. On the other hand, the usage of road surface by other vehicles is more than 60 per cent, while the passenger transportation buses use only a very low percentage of the road surface though their effect is much more significant to the economy. Meanwhile, employee transportation by the private sector and public sector commercial organisations has been encouraged by giving fiscal incentives. The expenditure incurred by these institutions on purchasing buses is exempted from income tax. In addition, these institutions are allowed to import buses and coaches free of customs duty. The local companies engaged in the bus assembling industry are also allowed duty free imports of parts and equipment. It is expected that these policies would result in decreasing the demand pressure for passenger transportation, especially during peak hours. In addition, the duty concession has been further extended to",

This increase has now been more than eroded by rising costs due to sharp increases in the prices of spare parts, increases in wages and due to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) introduced in April 1998. Lower profit margins in the industry have resulted in not only a deterioration of the quality of the service but also discouraged new investments in the bus industry. The continuation of the present fare structure would certainly be a burden to the government in time to come via subsidies to the public sector bus companies. The additional expenses arising from the wage increase of Rs. 1,000 given to the employees of RTCs with effect from January 1999 will also have to be borne by the government with increased budgetary allocations. There is a compelling need to increase the passenger fares by a reasonable amount, provided the additional income is satisfactorily used to provide a better quality and more reliable bus service to the public.",

Poor worker productivity is one of the major internal social problems, while the unsettled security situation in the Northern and Eastern Provinces is a major external social problem faced by the SLR. These problems are compounded by the unrealistically low rail fares, which are by no means near a cash recovery charge.

A new inter-city train was introduced between Galle and Colombo Fort. A day train service operated on the Trincomalee line and the Baticaloa line terminated at Polonnaruwa due to security reasons. Five new sub-stations were opened for train services during 1998. In addition, steps were taken to provide new stations in Kattuwa, Poonawa, Agbopura, Thismalpura and Pinnawala. Meanwhile, the operation of trains on schedule was improved as 60 per cent of trains arrived at their destination on time. The scheduled operations were further improved in the Colombo suburban areas, where up to 75 per cent of trains arrived at their destinations on time. The cancellation of trains accounted for only 5 per cent of total scheduled train journeys during 1998.

In addition, scheduled flights have also been rationalised in order that the benefits to Air Lanka will be maximized. The flown killometerage of the Air Lanka increased by 6 per cent, reaching 22,925,000 kms. in 1998. The freight tons carried at BIA indicated an increase of 4 per cent as compared with 1997.

Although private operators are willing to provide expanded domestic air transport services, and have already invested a large amount of money, security reasons and the absence of a clear and consistent civil aviation policy have adversely affected their performance. However, there is a considerable potential for developing the aviation sector as a commercially viable industry, in addition to the present achievements which have been mainly concentrated on travel and tourism.

    "text": "There were several factors contributing to the decline in the transhipment container handling at the Port of Colombo during 1998. First, the merger of several main shipping lines such as New World Alliance, and the purchase of APL by NOL resulted in a loss of nearly 100,000 TEUs to the Port of Colombo in 1998. Second, with the opening of the Port of Mina Raysut at Salalah in Oman, the SealandV Maersk Consortium diverted a greater portion of their transhipment handling from Colombo to Salalah, resulting in a loss of about 35,000 TEUs. Third, due to an accident, the Jaye Container Terminal (JCT) 2 terminal had to be closed for several months and as a result some vessels by-passed Colombo due to berthing delays. Finally, some alliances withdrew their services from Colombo due to the disintegration of these services and berthing delays in the Port of Colombo. This decline in transhipment handling partly recovered as several new shipping lines commenced their services to Colombo. Furthermore, the deployment of additional equipment at JCT, the opening of a new terminal and the change of the shift system to work 24 hours a day were helpful in reducing the turnaround time of ships to some extent and in preventing further diversion of transhipment cargo.",

Construction of an eight-high stacking empty container yard with the necessary equipment is in progress with assistance from JICA at a cost of Rs.612 million. In order to enhance the capacity and the productivity of the JCT, additional equipment is being installed at a cost of Rs. 1,750 million. Phase I of the North Pier development Project has been completed with the opening of a new container terminal called the Unity Container Terminal (UCT) in November 1998. The capacity of the UCT is 100,000 TEUs per annum. Phase II of the project is to commence shortly to add an additional 100,000 TEUs per annum.

After completion of the project, the container handling capacity of the QEQ will be enhanced to 1 million TEUs per annum from the present 250,000 TEUs per annum. The construction work of the project is to commence in 1999 and will be completed in three stages by 2004. Meanwhile, the SLPA has invited bids to construct an additional feeder berth at the Port of Colombo at a cost of Rs. 1,200 million. In addition, steps have also been taken to build a jetty at the Port of Galle at a cost of Rs.900 million to serve the needs of the Southern Province as well as to ease the congestion at the Port of Colombo by diverting break-bulk cargo ships to Galle. The construction of a new pier at the Trincomalee harbour at a cost of Rs.2,000 million has also been planned.",

There is no suitable criterion to gauge the volume and trends in housing construction in the country at present. While certain field surveys contain some information on dwellings, it is nevertheless difficult to obtain those data on a continuous basis. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) collects data relating to building approvals by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), including apartment complexes, and these are published in the monthly Bulletins. The coverage and the presentation of these data are limited and need to be improved. The limited availability of land and the high prices restricted housing construction within the CMC. Hence, it is necessary to widen the coverage, at least to include the Greater Colombo area, to obtain more representative information on the subject. In addition, an index for housing construction would be helpful in analysing the relationship between housing construction and general economic trends, in forecasting future economic trends and in identifying housing investor sentiment in response to changes in economic policies.",

Approvals of small houses (less than 1000 sq. ft.) had declined by about 16 per cent, while approvals of larger houses exceeding 2000 sq. ft. had grown by 3 per cent during this period. Although, there was an expansion in housing construction in 1997 and 1998 after a setback in 1996, housing approvals in 1998 were lower than in 1995.

Accordingly, construction of 7,300 housing units were to commenced during the year, while 5,070 housing units were completed by end 1998. Keeping in line with the government policy of providing own houses for estate workers, the NHDA, jointly with the Plantation Housing and Social Welfare Trust (PHSWT), implemented the EHP. Under the EHP, each beneficiary is given a loan of up to Rs.30,000 at an interest rate of 15 per cent per annum and recoverable within 15 years. During 1998, under the EHP, 2,224 housing units were begun, while 1,397 units were completed. Total loan disbursements under the EHP increased by 4 per cent to Rs.20 million by end 1998. The NHDA was directly involved in the construction of houses to be sold at a reasonable price, particularly to urban middle class families, under its DCP. During 1998, the construction of 810 such housing units was begun and 400 units were completed at a cost of Rs.339 million. The DHP has been designed especially to provide houses to displaced families in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Some of these families have opted to resettle in the Southern region so that housing facilities were provided there. Under the DHP, 2,351 housing units were completed, while the construction of 82 new units was begun at a total cost of Rs.25 million.",

In addition to the normal housing loan facilities, the SMIB has started a new housing loan scheme for estate sector employees against their individual EPF balances. Generally, a loan of Rs.25,000 is given under this scheme and as at end 1998, more than 5,000 such loans had been granted under this project.

Attractive tax incentives offered by the BOI encouraged both local and foreign entrepreneurs to invest in the real estate sector. Consequently, a total of 147 projects with a value of Rs. 99 billion had been approved by the BOI by the end of 1997. The Central Bank conducted a survey to examine the present status of some major real estate development projects located in Colombo and the suburbs, with special attention to the rate of occupancy and financial viability of the projects. A total of 33 large property development firms located in the Colombo City and suburbs were covered under this survey. The survey was conducted during July-August 1998. Sample was selection was based on information obtained from the BOI and a few banks. The main selection criterion was the cost of the construction project. New construction projects with costs exceeding Rs.200 million were included in the survey. Following are the findings of the survey.",

By end 1998, about 66 per cent of the population had access to safe drinking water (pipe borne, tube wells and protected dug wells). In the urban areas, 90 per cent of the population had access to safe drinking water, while in the rural sector only about 57 per cent enjoyed this facility. This emphasises the need for further expansion of water supply facilities in the rural sector in order to improve the hygienic conditions of the rural population. The expansion in urban population, inadequate availability of safe drinking water in rural areas and high growth in industrial and commercial activities have forced the authorities to engage in urgent expansion of the water supply facilities in the country. With this end in view, the NWS&DB spent a sum of Rs.2,533 million on the water supply sector during the year under review. Of the total investment, 58 per cent was financed from foreign sources such as IDA, ADB, OECF and ODA on concessional terms. The major water supply schemes (WSS) completed by the NWS&DB during the year included the Matara WSS, Nilambe WSS, Towns East of Colombo WSS, Udunuwara - Yatinuwara WSS, Deraniyagala WSS, Balapitiya -Demodara WSS, Udappuwa WSS and Marandagahamula WSS. The second water supply and sanitation project funded by the ADB to carry out rehabilitation work on 16 water supply schemes in the Western and Central provinces was in progress during 1998. The third water supply and sanitation project, also funded by the ADB aims at strengthening the private sector, local authorities and community organisations to monitor and manage their own water supply schemes in rural areas. Preliminary studies are being conducted in respect of the Kalu Ganga Project to enhance the water capacity of the Colombo WSS by 6,000 cubic meters per day through the intake of water from the Kalu Ganga. Meanwhile, with the objective of expanding the water supply facilities in rural areas, the Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project (CWSSP), funded by the IDA continued to be implemented during 1998 under several sub-programmes, such as the Village Water Supply and Sanitation Programme, the School Water Supply and Sanitation Programme and the Small Town Water Supply and Sanitation Programme. The CWSSP aims at providing water and sanitation facilities to 680,000 people living in 2,800 villages and in 12 small towns in the Badulla, Matara, Ratnapura and Moneragala districts.",

    "text": "Total revenue of the NWS&DB rose by 19 per cent to Rs. 2,404 million in 1998. This increase in revenue was largely attributable to the upward revision of the water tariff with effect from 1 March 1998. In this tariff revision, the tariff applicable to the domestic sector was raised by 20 - 39 per cent. The tariff rates applicable to the industrial and commercial sectors were raised by a low rate of 9 per cent, while the tariff for tourist/guest house category increased by 10 per cent. The main objective of the water tariff increase was to recover a part of the increased cost of water production, due to increased electricity bills and rising emoluments to employees. Another objective of the tariff revision was to reduce the cross subsidy between different categories of water consumers. In addition, the tariff revision was also intended to motivate people to conserve water and reduce wastage by giving an economic value to water. Another concern over the water supply sector of the country is the high proportion of unaccounted water, amounting to 42 per cent, mainly due to unattended leakages, illegal tapping, stand posts etc. The NWS&DB would benefit significantly if the proportion of unaccounted water is reduced to an acceptable level through timely and effective maintenance of the distribution network. Private sector participation, particularly in the areas of distribution, maintenance and revenue collection within some franchised areas, could enhance the productivity in this sector.",

The Samurdhi Programme was introduced in 1995 in order to reduce the problems of the under-privileged, by providing benefits in a meaningful way to uplift their economic and social conditions, as well as to address their problems relating to unemployment. Accordingly, almost all the social benefit schemes hitherto operated by different institutions were brought under this Samurdhi Programme. The total number of beneficiary families in the Samurdhi Programme as at end 1998 was 1,973,183, which was a marginal decline, compared to 1997. This decrease was a result of the policies implemented during 1998 in order to bring the total number to a realistic level by restricting new entrants and removing non-eligible families. Despite this decrease, Samurdhi beneficiaries still account for about 51 per cent of the total number of families though it is estimated that the number of families in the low income group should be around 30 -40 per cent of the total. This situation has adverse effects on the entire programme by preventing the really deserving groups from receiving improved benefits. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on better targetting.",

Further, a Ministry for Environment was set up in 1990 with a view to co\u00adordinating environmental activities at the national level and setting national environment policies towards achieving sustainable development. Accordingly, the Ministry prepared a National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) in 1994 and updated it in 1998 to identify the issues and necessary policy intervention relating to land and water, forest and bio\u00addiversity, coastal and marine resources, industrial and urban pollution and the energy and minerals sectors.

In order to review the recommendations made in the NEAP and the policy studies further, eight committees on Environment and Environment Policy Management have been established. These committees, in turn, are expected to report to the Committee on Integrating Environment and Development Policies. The Ministry has also initiated action to study the impact on the environment of globalisation and the other commitments arising from global and regional agreements, conventions and treaties.",

    "text": "Meanwhile, the CEA processed 32 Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and 32 Initial Environment Evaluations (IEE) and approved 11 EIAs and 7 IEEs during the year under review. The CEA has taken steps to amend the NEA with a view to expediting the processing of IEE. In the proposed amendment, this is to be achieved by removing the 30 day period given for public comment on IEE reports. However, it may be more advisable to reduce the time period allocated for public comment, rather than removing it altogether, in order to guarantee transparency in project implementation. Meanwhile, the CEA issued 194 new Environmental Protection Licences (EPL) and renewed 370 EPLs in 1998, compared with 163 and 309, respectively, in 1997. The CEA continued monitoring the discharge of effluents, air emissions and noise by industries, and analysed 354 industrial affluent samples, against 219 during 1997. Further, the CEA monitored the Seethawaka Industrial Estate Development Project, the LPG Import Terminal Project at Kerawalapitiya, the Kukuleganga Hydropower Project and the Alupotha Sanitary Land Filling Project during 1998. The ambient air quality monitoring programme and the monitoring of major water bodies in the country were also continued. Meanwhile, the CEA received 1,221 public complaints on environment related problems. Action has been taken in respect of 461 of those by the CEA. The rest were referred to the respective Local Government Authorities and other relevant organisations. Further, the CEA trained 100 officers of Local Government Authorities in the issue of EPL and selection of sites for industries. A number of programmes were conducted by the CEA in 1998 to enhance environmental awareness, change attitudes and develop skills, particularly among school children.",
