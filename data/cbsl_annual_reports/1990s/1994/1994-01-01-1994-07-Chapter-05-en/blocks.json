    "text": "The rapid growth in commercial energy consumption was the salient feature of the energy sector during 1994. The demand for electricity rose by almost ten per cent during the year, despite a significant increase in electricity tariffs. On the supply side, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was able to meet the bulk of the demand through hydro power. An increase in thermal power generation was required during the third quarter of the year, due to the persistent growth in electricity demand, coupled with unfavourable weather conditions. Meanwhile, the total demand for petroleum products expanded significantly in 1994 due to increased demand for auto diesel, heavy diesel, petrol and kerosene. The adverse impact of the increased consumption of petroleum products on the oil bill was mitigated to a great extent by the lower prices of crude oil in the international markets during the year. The developments in the energy sector in 1994 point to the need for a sound demand management policy in the short run and a strategy for planned expansion in supply in the long run.",

    "text": "The total installed capacity of electricity at 1,409 MW, comprising 1,137 MW of hydro power and 272 MW of thermal power, has remained unchanged since 1992. However, the total power generated by the CEB grew from 3,979 GWh in 1993 to 4,364 GWh in 1994. This was a growth of 10 per cent compared with an expansion of 12 per cent in the previous year. Hydro power genera\u00adtion increased by 21 per cent during the first half of 1994. However, due to a reduction in hydro power generation during the third quarter of the year following a reduction in the water levels in some of the hydro reservoirs, the overall increase in hydro power generation in 1994 was only 8 per cent. Consequently, thermal power generation rose by 50 per cent to 275 GWh, to meet the additional demand during the year under review. Reflecting these developments, the cost of fuel for power generation increased from Rs.347 million in 1993 to Rs.801 million in 1994. Meanwhile, the losses involved in power generation, transmission and distribution increased marginally from 17.6 per cent of total generation in 1993 to 17.8 per cent in 1994. The CEB has undertaken a major project called the \"Distribution, Expansion and Rehabilitation Project\" to reduce the losses on transmission and distribution. In addition two projects (Local Authority Takeover I & II) have been undertaken to rehabilitate the distribution systems of Local Authorities.",

In February, tariff rates applicable to the domestic category were raised within a range of 1 per cent to 183 per cent, depending on the level of consumption. Tariffs in the other categories rose by about 30 per cent. However, in May 1994, the tariff rate on the first 100 units in respect of the domestic category was brought down to the level that prevailed in July 1993, reducing the rates by a range of 29 per cent to 65 per cent. Consequent to these tariff revisions, the average tariff fate per unit increased by 39 per cent to Rs.3.68 in 1994, from Rs.2.64 in 1993. The revised electricity rates and the previous rates are shown in Table 1.30.",

The sales to domestic consumers expanded by 13 per cent to 933 GWh in 1994. Prompted by increased economic activity, sales to industrial and commercial sectors expanded by 7 per cent during the year under review. Bulk sales to local authorities and Lanka Electric Company (LECO) by the CEB increased by 14 per cent in 1994 over the previous year. Sales by LECO expanded by 12 per cent, largely due to increased sales to the domestic and commercial sectors.",

    "text": "In 1994, domestic consumption of petroleum products recorded a significant increase of 11 per cent in contrast to a decline of 5 per cent in the preceding year. The growth in consumption was witnessed in all varieties of petroleum products. The consumption of auto diesel, which began to grow significantly from 1992, expanded by 10 per cent in 1994. Following the same trend, the demand for petrol in 1994, at 183,680 metric tons, recorded a 6 per cent increase. It rose by 5 per cent in the previous year. The consumption of heavy diesel, at 53,902 metric tons in 1994, recorded a nearly three-fold increase over the previous year. This resulted from the increased use of heavy diesel for thermal power generation. The sales of furnace oil rose by 4 per cent to 228,345 metric tons in 1994. The consumption of furnace oil by the non-electricity sector was 192,100 metric tons, an increase of 9 per cent when compared with the previous year. The demand for kerosene in 1994 at 206,929 metric tons, grew by 8 per cent, compared with a marginal increase in the previous year. The growth in the consumption of kerosene was most prominent in the fourth quarter of the year, where it rose by 14 per cent when compared with the demand in the corresponding quarter of 1993. Meanwhile, the demand for LPG at 64,257 metric tons, grew by 22 per cent in 1994, the highest increase recorded for the past 5 years. More than 70 per cent of this rise is attributed to the increased use of gas by the domestic sector.",

As in the previous year, concerted efforts were made by these companies to strengthen the effective fleet by purchas\u00ading new buses and rehabilitating the existing fleet. In 1994, a total of 1,600 buses was added to the existing fleet of the peoplised companies. As a result of the expanded bus fleet, the average number of buses operated per day by these companies increased from 3,709 in 1993 to 4,261 in 1994. However, even with this expansion, by end of 1994, the available effective fleet of the peoplised companies was only 75 per cent of the optimum fleet which is required to provide an efficient service to the public. Following these developments, the operated kilometerage of the peoplised companies rose by 13 per cent over the previous year to 307 million in 1994. In terms of traffic carried, peoplised companies accounted for an estimated passenger kilometerage of 15,613 million indicating an increase of 15 per cent between the two years. The estimated revenue of the peoplised companies rose by 16 per cent to Rs.3,528 million in 1994. Meanwhile, bus imports and activities relating to the bus assembly scheme continued throughout the year. By the end of 1994, the project provided 2,397 buses to the peoplised companies and the private sector.",

Trains on the Northern line operated up to Thandikulam, while there were no train services on the Talaimannar line. The Colombo-Batticaloa train service commenced its daily operations in August 1994. Meanwhile, punctuality and adequacy of the service were heavily affected by the unsatisfactory condition of the existing railway tracks and insufficient availability of locomo\u00adtives for service. Towards the end of the year, the SLR introduced a crash programme to rehabilitate the tracks in dense traffic areas and suburban areas with a view to arresting further deterioration of the service. In addition, construction work on the Matara-Kataragama railway track was in progress during the year, the first phase of which is the laying of railway lines between Matara and Walasgala.

Foreign parcel handling increased by 7 per cent to 74,000 between 1993 and 1994, while inland parcel handling dropped marginally to 579,000 in 1994. The post office network expanded from 4,042 post offices in 1993 to 4,105 in 1994. Accordingly, the area served by a post office came down marginally to 16.0 square kilometres in 1994 from 16.2 square kilometres in 1993 reflecting increased access to postal services to the general public. The average number of letters per inhabitant showed only a marginal increase between the two years, partly reflecting the increased usage of speedier commu\u00adnication modes by the public.",

With the improved infrastructure, telephone lines provided to the public rose significantly by 25,322 to 180,724 by end 1994. This was the highest number of new telephones provided during the past 10 years. Consequently, the telephone density (telephones per 100 persons) rose from 0.90 to 1.01 between 1993 and 1994. However, reflecting the inability of the supply to keep pace with the accelerating demand for telephone facilities, the number of applicants on the waiting list increased by 62,179 to 186,245 at the end of 1994. SLT was able to meet only 49 per cent of the country's demand for telephone facilities by the end of 1994. The increased availability of cellular communication facilities eased, to a certain extent, the accelerating demand for telephone facilities. The Mobitel Cellular Mobile Telephone System installed and operated on a \"Build, Operate and Transfer\" (BOT) basis was able to provide approximately 10,000 telephones by end 1994. The areas covered under this system were Anuradhapura, Ratnapura, Kurunegala, Kuliyapitiya, Chilaw, Negombo, Ja-ela, Colombo, Matara, Kalutara, Galle, Moratuwa and Kandy.

The remaining 1.1 million families who are estimated to earn an average income of around Rs. 1,000 per month will be given an income supplement of Rs.500 per month. Thus, the effect of this Programme will be to raise the income of the poor families to about Rs. 1,500 per month.

Favourable weather conditions that prevailed in the hydro catch\u00adment areas contributed to this improved performance. The Bowatenna power plant, which was closed for repairs in 1993, was recommissioned in April 1994, and generated 38 Gwh. The per\u00adformance of all the power plants except Ukuwela was better in 1994 than in the previous year. Power generated at Randenigala, which rose by 87 per cent in 1993, recorded a further 27 per cent increase to 468 Gwh. in 1994. Power generated at Victoria, Kotmale and Rantambe too rose by 12 per cent, 14 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively to 819 Gwh., 512 Gwh. and 224 Gwh. Victoria, Kotmale, Randenigala and Rantambe recorded the highest ever generation recorded in any particu\u00adlar year since the commissioning of these plants. In contrast the power generated at Ukuwela dropped by 18 per cent to 146 Gwh.
