Tea, rubber and coconut together accounted for only 22 per cent of total export earnings in 1994. The expansion of the garment industry brought about a diversification of Sri Lanka's export structure, which had overwhelmingly relied on traditional agricultural exports for many decades. The industry has been the main gross foreign exchange earner, displacing tea to second place, since 1986.",
