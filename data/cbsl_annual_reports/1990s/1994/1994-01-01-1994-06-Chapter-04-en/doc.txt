INDUSTRY

OVERALL PERFORMANCE

The industrial sector continued to expand in 1994 but with a moderation of its growth momen­tum. The value of industrial output, which grew by 14 per cent in real terms in 1993, expanded by a further 9 per cent in 1994. This growth came entirely from the private sector industries, which grew by 11 per cent. The public sector, which accounted for only a ninth of total industrial production, recorded a decline of 5 per cent.

In the private sector, the industrial sub-sectors that recorded large increases in production were: non-metallic mineral products; chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products; wood and wood products; paper and paper products; fabricated metal products and food, beverages and tobacco. The reduced output of the public sector industries was largely due to a sharp decline in the output of the non-metallic mineral products category following the transfer of ownership of several industrial enterprises from the public to the private sector.

The output of export-oriented industries as a group, recorded a growth of 11 per cent in SDR terms in 1994. The value of industrial exports increased from Rs. 100,420 million in 1993 to Rs.l 16,744 million in 1994.

PRODUCTION

In real terms, the value of industrial output is estimated to have increased by 9 per cent in 1994. Industrial sub-sectors that recorded increases in production in 1994 were: basic metal products (33 per cent); wood and wood products (16 per cent); paper and paper products (14 per cent); fabricated metal products (14 per cent); non-metallic mineral products (13 per cent); manu­factured products not elsewhere specified (13 per cent); chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products (11 per cent); food, beverages and tobacco (8 per cent) and textile, wearing apparel and leather products (6 per cent).

PRIVATE SECTOR INDUSTRIES

The value of production of private sector industries, which grew by 13 per cent in real terms in 1993, expanded by a further 11 per cent in 1994. This growth originated, to a large extent, from four product categories, viz. food, beverages and tobacco; textile, wearing apparel and leather; chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products and non-metallic mineral products.

The output of the textile, wearing apparel and leather products sub-sector originated entirely from private sector industries. The output of this category expanded by 6 per cent in 1994 com­pared to a growth of 17 per cent in the previous year. The creation of excess capacities in the garment sector without a proper consideration of quota availability had an adverse impact on the efficiency and the profitability of the industry. Low prices fetched by the export oriented industries were largely responsible for the decline in growth momentum in the garment sector. Labour disputes that prevailed in certain major textile and garment enterprises also had a negative impact on the performance of the sector. Leather products recorded a significant increase in output during the year mainly due to the improved performance of the BOI enterprises engaged in the manufac­ture of these products.

The output of the food, beverages and tobacco category, which constituted nearly 26 per cent of the private sector industrial output, grew by 8 per cent in 1994. The increased output of private sector industries in this category largely reflected the improved production of dairy products, biscuits, confectionery, flour, processing of fruits and vegetables and meat products. In contrast, the

53

output of tobacco products, which is the highest contributor to the total output of the food, bever­ages and tobacco category, recorded a marginal decline in 1994 due to restricted production follow­ing a labour dispute as well as due to a fall in domestic demand. The production of poultry feed recorded a decline primarily due to labour unrest in the major manufacturing enterprise.

The output of private sector industries accounted for about half of the total output of the chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products category in 1994. Increased output levels were recorded in private sector industries engaged in the manufacture of agro-chemicals, pharmaceuti­cals, rubber and plastic products, soap and toiletries. The export oriented BOI industries manufac­turing industrial and surgical gloves and plastic products also recorded an improved performance in 1994.

Private sector industries that contributed about four-fifths of the total output of the non-metallic mineral products sub-sector, continued to expand in 1994. Increased output levels were recorded in private sector industries engaged in the manufacture of cement, glass and glass prod­ucts and asbestos to satisfy the increased demand arising from the improved level of construction activities during the year. In contrast, ceramic products which reported a significant expansion in the previous year, declined in 1994 owing to labour unrest. The export-oriented BOI industries engaged in the manufacture of dolomite products, porcelain figurines and granite slabs, showed improved performance in output. Cutting and polishing of diamonds recorded only a marginal improvement due to slow growth in exports.

Private sector industries in the paper and paper product sub-sector recorded a growth of 16 per cent in output in 1994. This increase originated largely from industries engaged in printing and manufacturing of paper and paper products, labels and packing materials.

The output of the fabricated metal product sub-sector that recorded a poor performance in the previous year, showed a substantial improvement in 1994. Higher growth in output of fabricated metal products in 1994 originated largely from the improved performance of private sector indus­tries manufacturing fabricated metal, electrical appliances, batteries, cables and bulbs. Increased output levels were also recorded in private sector industries engaged in the fabrication of coach work of buses and lorries.

The output of manufactured products not elsewhere specified recorded a substantial improve­ment in 1994 compared with moderate expansion in the previous year. This increase originated, to a large extent, in the industries engaged in the manufacture of coir fibre products, mattresses, fishing gear and nylon nets, brushes and jewellery.

PUBLIC SECTOR INDUSTRIES

In real terms, the public sector industrial output declined by 5 per cent in 1994, in contrast to a 20 per cent increase in the previous year. This was mainly a result of a sharp decline in the output of non-metallic mineral products category following the transfer of ownership of cement and ceramic production units from the public sector to the private sector in December 1993. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), which accounted for about 78 per cent of total public sector indus­trial output, recorded a 4 per cent increase in 1994. When petroleum is excluded, public sector industrial output is estimated to have declined by 33 per cent.

The enterprises that recorded decreases in output were State Timber Corporation (13 per cent) and Lanka Phosphate Ltd. (11 per cent).

Under the Government's peoplisation programme, the ownership of Wayamba Agro-Fertilizer Co. Ltd., Ruhunu Agro-Fertilizer Co. Ltd., and Lanka Lubricants Ltd., was transferred from the public sector to the private sector during the year.

The output of the State Timber Corporation declined due to an insufficient supply of timber which resulted from a reduced level of felling operations. A drop in sales in the domestic market led to a reduced level of output of Lanka Phosphate Ltd..

Public sector industrial enterprises that recorded production increases during the year were: Ceylon Steel Corporation Ltd. (42 per cent), Lanka Salt Ltd. (15 per cent), Sevanagala Sugar Industries Co. Ltd. (15 per cent), National Paper Co. Ltd. (15 per cent), Sri Lanka Rubber Manufac­turing Co. Ltd. (5 per cent) and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (4 per cent).

Adequate supplies of raw materials resulted in an increase in the output of the Ceylon Steel Corporation Ltd.. The rise in production of the Sevanagala Sugar Industries Co. Ltd., was mainly a result of increased availability of sugar cane during the year. Dry weather conditions that prevailed during the harvesting period resulted in an increase in the output of Lanka Salt Ltd. in 1994. The higher level of capacity utilization at the Valachchenai mill following increased demand for paper products was the major reason for the increase in output of the National Paper Co. Ltd. in 1994.

In terms of the sectoral classification of public enterprises, the basic metal products sector recorded the highest growth rate (42 per cent). The other sectors that recorded increased levels of output were: food, beverages and tobacco (15 per cent); paper and paper products (8 per cent) and chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products (4 per cent). The sectors that recorded decreases in output were non-metallic mineral products (95 per cent) and wood and wood products (13 per cent).

VALUE OF PRODUCTION IN CURRENT TERMS

The value of overall industrial production, in current terms, is estimated to have increased by 15 per cent in 1994. The value of wood and wood products rose by 30 per cent; basic metal products by 28 per cent; manufactured products n.e.s. by 20 per cent; fabricated metal products, machinery and transport equipment by 20 per cent; paper and paper products by 18 per cent; non-metallic mineral products by 18 per cent; chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products by 18 per cent; textile wearing apparel and leather products by 12 per cent and food, beverages and tobacco by 14 per cent.

INDUSTRIAL POLICY

The Government continued to provide improved infrastructure facilities to industries on a regional basis during the year under review. The fourth Investment Promotion Zone was set up at Pallekele in the Central Province in April 1994. The Government has initiated a programme of establishing industrial estates/parks in various regions of the country in collaboration with local and foreign private investors. The Science and Technology Development Act was approved by the Cabinet in May 1994, with a view to promoting the use of science and technology in the industrial sector.

57

Several tax reforms were introduced during the year under review. The corporate tax rate was reduced from 40 per cent to 35 per cent with effect from April 1994 for the purpose of promoting new investments. Concessionary tax holidays hitherto granted to BOI enterprises were replaced by a Preferential Tax Rate of 15 per cent with effect from April 1994.

In keeping with the Government policy on privatisation, the majority shares representing 90 per cent each of the Wayamba Agro- Fertilizer Co. Ltd., Ruhunu Agro-fertilizer Co. Ltd. and Lanka Lubricants Ltd., to the value of Rs.20.5 million, Rs.22.9 million and Rs.239.1 million, respectively, were sold through Cabinet appointed tender boards during the year under review.

FACILITIES TO INDUSTRIES

The industrial sector continued to receive financial assistance on concessional terms during the year under review. The Small and Medium-term Industrial Project Scheme (SMI) of the National Development Bank funded by assistance from IDA was the major financing programme under which industries received financial assistance. In addition, %e Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC), the National Development Bank (NDB) and other commercial banks provided direct financial facilities to industrial ventures in the form of loans and equity participation.

As at end December 1994, the Central Bank had issued 14,368 guarantees covering loan disbursements of Rs.5,063 million in respect of Small Scale Industries (SSI) and Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMI) I, II, III and IV. A sum of Rs. 1,450 million was fully recovered in respect of 4,578 loans amounting to Rs.3,737 million as at the end of the year. With regard to the loans outstanding, a sum of Rs.233 million had fallen into arrears in respect of 8,167 loans. As at end 1994, the Central Bank had paid a sum of Rs.75 million in settlement of 502 claims.

The National Development Bank (NDB) provides direct financial assistance to industrial projects by way of loans and equity participation. In 1994, the NDB approved 352 projects with an outlay of Rs.5,417 million for direct financing assistance in comparison to 262 projects serviced with an outlay of Rs.4,114 million in 1993. During the year under review, the NDB participated in 22 projects by providing Rs.281 million worth of equity. The industrial categories that received, major shares of these facilities were: chemical, rubber and plastic products; food, beverages and tobacco; textile, wearing apparel and leather products and basic metal products.

The DFCC approved 304 projects with an outlay of Rs.2,501 million for the industrial sector by way of loans and equity participation. The industrial categories that received major shares of these facilities were: fabricated metal products; food, beverages and tobacco; chemical, rubber and plastic products and textile, wearing apparel and leather products.

During 1994, commercial banks too continued to provide financial facilities. Commercial bank advances to the industrial sector during the first nine months of the year increased by 6 per cent from Rs.l8,450 million as at end December 1993 to Rs.l9,508 million as at end September 1994.

PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT

The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) continued to function as a "One-stop Investment Promotion Centre". The BOI approved 291 projects in 1994, under Section 17 of the BOI Law (Special Incentive Scheme) bringing the total number of projects approved to 1,482 by end 1994. Of these, agreements had been signed in respect of 993 projects with the BOI to set up various industries.

A total of 442 enterprises were in commercial operation as at end 1994. Of those in operation, 92 were in the Katunayake Investment Promotion Zone (KIPZ), 38 in the Biyagama Investment Promotion Zone (BIPZ), 11 in the Koggala Investment Promotion Zone (KglPZ) and 301 in other parts of the country.

By the end of 1994, the industrial sector recorded substantial new investment in projects that were in operation under Section 17 of the BOI Act. Of the enterprises that have signed agreements with the BOI, 449 enterprises had invested Rs.46,959 million as at the end of December 1994. The foreign component of this investment was Rs.28,238 million or 60 per cent of the total investment. Textiles, wearing apparel and leather products; chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products and manufactured products (n.e.s.) categories absorbed 17 per cent, 9 per cent and 5 per cent of the total investment, respectively.

In 1994, employment in BOI enterprises (excluding 200 garment projects) increased by 10 per cent bringing the total number employed in these enterprises to 134,572 persons. Of these, 73,045 were engaged in the textile, wearing apparel and leather product sector. The relative share of employment in this category declined from 57 per cent in 1993 to 54 per cent in 1994. Employment in the Two Hundred Garment Factory Project at the end of 1994 was 71,088 persons. Chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products; manufactured products (n.e.s.) and non-metallic mineral products were among the product categories that recorded higher rates of employment generation.

The total envisaged investment of projects approved in 1994 amounted to Rs 43,262 million. Of this, 57 per cent is expected from local sources.

Gross export earnings of BOI enterprises including the Two Hundred Garment Factory Project amounted Rs.86,815 million (SDR 1,223 million) in 1994 compared with Rs.76,740 million (SDR 1,145 million) in 1993. This was an increase of Rs.10,075 million or 13 per cent. In SDR terms, the increase was 7 per cent. Gross exports earnings from textiles, ready made garments and leather products in rupee terms recorded a 6 per cent increase in 1994 compared with a growth of 86 per cent recorded in the previous year. This category continued to be the major foreign exchange earner, accounting for 69 per cent of the total export earnings of BOI enterprises. In the non-garment export sector, product categories that showed significant increases in export earnings were: chemicals, plastic products; non-metallic mineral products and food & beverages.

During the year, promotional activities were undertaken in Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, South Africa and the U.K. Two seminars were held in Sri Lanka to attract prospective investors to the electronic sector and the agriculture sector.

WEARING APPAREL SECTOR

The garment industry has become Sri Lanka's main export oriented industry manufacturing a wide range of high quality apparel. According to the Ministry of Industrial Development and the Board of Investment, 687 garment factories were in operation by the end of 1994. Of these, 375 garment factories were registered with the Ministry of Industrial Development and 312 garment factories were serviced by the Board of Investment. The latter included 165 factories set up under the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme. Of the BOI garment factories, 97 were approved under Section 17 of the BOI Law (Special Incentive Scheme). Fifty factories were in operation under Section 16 of the BOI Law (General Incentive Scheme).

The direct employment opportunities generated by the garment sector, largely for rural youth, amounted to about 225,000. Exports of garments, which amounted to Rs.24,287 million or 31 per cent of Sri Lanka's total export earnings in 1990, rose to Rs.68,945 million or 44 per cent of the total export earning of the country in 1994. Tea, rubber and coconut together accounted for only 22 per cent of total export earnings in 1994. The expansion of the garment industry brought about a diversification of Sri Lanka's export structure, which had overwhelmingly relied on traditional agricultural exports for many decades. The industry has been the main gross foreign exchange earner, displacing tea to second place, since 1986.

The industry has demonstrated a degree of maturity with improved competitiveness, in the recent past. The challenge facing the industry at present is the urgent need to improve its ability to withstand increasing international competition with the possible phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement (MFA) under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing over a ten year period directed towards creating complete free trade in textiles and clothing by the year 2005.

The quality and price competitiveness of Sri Lanka's apparel products have been reflected in their ability to enter sophisticated markets. About 92 per cent of Sri Lanka's garments are exported to the USA and EEC. The USA was Sri Lanka's largest importer with a share of 61 per cent of Sri Lanka's exports in 1994. The EEC's share was the second largest with 32 per cent. The other markets where apparel exporters have established a foot-hold included Canada, Japan and South Korea.

Country quota availability and utilization rates in respect of the USA, EEC and Canada are given in Tables 1.25, 1.26 and 1.27 respectively.

Under the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme, 165 enterprises were in commercial operation providing employment for about 71,088 persons by the end of December 1994, while 9 enterprises were at various stages of implementation. Capital outlay committed to the programme by the private sector is estimated at Rs.5,380 million. Export earnings of these enterprises

amounted to Rs.32,424 million or 54 per cent of the total textile and garment exports of the BOI industries during 1994.

REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF NEW INDUSTRIES

Industrial policy continued to aim at promoting industrial activities in the rural areas with a view to developing regions as well as minimising the adverse effects of the excessive concentration of industries in the Colombo District. The regional distribution of industries registered under the Ministry of Industrial Development disclosed that 23 per cent or 346 enterprises were located outside the Colombo District.

By the end of 1994, out of the 442 industries that were in operation under Section 17 of the BOI Law, 79 per cent or 348 enterprises were located in the Colombo and Gampaha Districts, mainly as a result of the infrastructure facilities provided in the Katunayake and Biyagama Invest­ment Promotion Zones. Twenty one enterprises were in commercial operation in the Galle District mainly because of the Koggala Investment Promotion Zone.

Out of 349 enterprises that were in commercial operation by the end of 1994 under Section 16 of the BOI Law (General Incentive Scheme), 280 or 80 per cent were located in the Colombo and Gampaha Districts due to the better infrastructure facilities available in these Districts. Location of BOI enterprises in difficult areas, particularly in districts such as Trincomalee, Monaragala, Matale, Vavuniya, Matara and Hambantota was also a notable feature. Under the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme, 165 garment factories came into existence in 21 districts. Of these, 142 garment factories were located outside the Colombo and Gampaha Districts. The number of garment factories located in the Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Kandy and Ratnapura Dis­tricts were 15,11,13,12 and 15, respectively.
