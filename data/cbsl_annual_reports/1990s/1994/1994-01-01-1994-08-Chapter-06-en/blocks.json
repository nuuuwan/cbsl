Thus, the annual average rate of price increase declined to a single digit level in 1994 for the first time since 1987. The point to point increase of the Index as at December (December 1994 over December 1993) was a low 4.2 per cent, compared to the corresponding increase as at December 1993 which was 10.3 per cent. The Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index (GCPI), which is an Index with wider geographic coverage than the Colombo Consumers' Price Index, registered an even lower annual average increase of 4.8 per cent in 1994. This was a significant drop from the increase of 8.4 per cent registered by the GCPI in 1993. The Wholesale Price Index also registered a lower increase of 5.0 per cent in 1994 compared with 7.6 per cent in 1993.",

However, with a 19.6 per cent increase, the Broad Money Supply continued to exert high demand pressure on the general price level.",

The usual moderation in prices during the period March to April, which coincides with the Maha harvesting season, was not felt until May, as a result of the cultivation in Maha 1993/94 being delayed by late monsoon rains. From May onwards, a clear decelerating trend in prices was observed. This trend was reinforced when the administrative price reductions came into effect in June. The impact on the CCPI of the price reductions in wheat flour, bread and kerosene was substantial. If these price reductions had not been effected, the rate of price increase would have been 10.1 per cent rather than the 8.4 per cent actually registered.",

    "text": "Prices in the food category rose by 8.9 per cent on an annual average basis in 1994 compared to 11.2 per cent in the preceding year. In May 1994, import duties on dried fish and lentils were waived while duties on canned fish and sugar were reduced. The price of wheat flour was reduced from Rs. 13.30 per kg. to Rs. 11.80 per kg. in July 1994 and as a result the price of bread fell from Rs. 5.50 to Rs. 5.00 per 450 gm. loaf. Subsequent to the new Government assuming office, the price of wheat flour was further reduced to Rs. 7.45 per kg. while the price of bread came down to Rs. 3.50 per 450 gm. loaf. A favourable supply position helped to contain the prices of several other major food items during the year. Paddy production in 1994 was estimated to have increased when compared to the previous year. Consequently, rice prices remained almost unchanged when compared with the average level of the previous year. The substitution effect of the reduction in wheat flour and bread prices would also have had a dampening effect on rice prices. The price of coconuts declined sharply following improved production, while the price of dried chillies was depressed owing to the availability of imported stocks in the market. Sharp price increases were recorded for vegetables, onions, fresh fish and potatoes during the year. However, the declines in prices of bread, coconuts and dried chillies largely contributed towards the slowing down of the overall rate of increase in prices of food items.",

In 1994, the WPI rose by 5.0 per cent, which was lower than the 7.6 per cent increase recorded by the Index in 1993. The decline in the prices of major export commodities, tea and coconut, largely contributed to the deceleration in the rate of increase in prices experienced during the year. Prices in the food sub group declined marginally during the year, while prices in the alcoholic drinks, textiles and footwear, chemical and chemical products, and petroleum products too slowed down when compared with the increases recorded in the previous year. Sharp price increases were registered in the non-metallic products, fuel and light and miscellaneous categories during the year.",

In the food category, however, price movements are strongly influenced by changes in the prices of major export commodities under the food category like tea, coconut and coconut products, which have a high weight in the Index. During the year, the prices of all three elevational categories of tea decreased. The prices of coconuts dropped sharply by over 20 per cent while the price of coconut oil decreased by almost 15 per cent. In addition, the price of paddy in the open market also fell by a substantial 8 per cent, while the price of wheat flour was reduced by 11 per cent. The price of dried chillies also dropped during the year. These price declines more than offset the sharp price increases experienced in commodities like fish, vegetables, potatoes and sugar and caused the sub index for food to decline during the year.",

In 1993, however, nominal wages grew sharply by 21.1 per cent and real wages by 8.3 per cent following the implementation of the 1993 new salary scales. Nominal wage rate indices for all non-executive officers rose by 11.3 per cent in 1994 while their real wages improved by 2.8 per cent. The rectification of anomalies for clerical and allied grades and the middle level technical service in August 1994 was responsible for the growth in wages of non-executive grades. In the previous year, however, growth in nominal wages was much higher at 22.7 per cent while growth in real wages was 9.5 per cent for this category. The wage rate index for minor employees grew by 6.0 per cent in 1994, representing a real wage deterioration of 2.2 per cent. The wage rate index for government school teachers rose by 5.0 per cent representing a real wage deterioration of 3.0 per cent during the year.",

Real wages for workers covered by Wages Boards deteriorated by 4.2 per cent during 1994, whereas in the previous year, real wages improved by 4.1 per cent. The slowing down in growth in wages for workers in Agriculture, which dominates the Index, was the reason for the lower overall increase in wages for workers covered by Wages Boards. Workers in Agriculture experienced a nominal wage growth of only 2.2 per cent in 1994 which represented a real wage deterioration of 5.7 per cent. In the previous year, wages for workers in Agriculture grew substantially by 21.1 per cent in nominal terms, while real wages had improved by 8.3 per cent. Wages for workers in State Plantations had remained stagnant since the granting of the budgetary allowance of Rs. 12/- and the freezing of the Cost of Living Allowance",

In 1993, wages for these workers had remained stagnant in nominal terms and real wages had deteriorated by 10.6 per cent. The growth of wages for workers in Industry and Commerce at 5.2 per cent in 1994, was higher than the growth registered in the preceding year (3.4 per cent).
