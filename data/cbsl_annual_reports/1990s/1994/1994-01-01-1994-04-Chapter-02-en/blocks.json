Led by the expansion in exports of industrial goods, the Manufacturing sector recorded a growth rate of 9.1 per cent in real terms in 1994 compared with 10.5 per cent in 1993. The contribution of the Manufacturing sector to the overall growth in GNP was 33 per cent in 1994. The share of Agriculture and Trade sectors in GNP growth were also significant at 13 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. Favourable weather conditions in 1994 resulted in relatively higher production volumes in tea, rubber, coconut, paddy and subsidiary food crops. The Agriculture sector, inclusive of forestry and fishing, recorded a growth of 3.3 per cent during the year under review. In comparison, the growth achieved in the previous year was 4.9 per cent. This growth however, was over a low production base in several crops in 1992, which resulted from the drought in that year. The Construction sector was able to sustain the high rates of growth recorded in recent years. This also reflected a continuity in the underlying favourable long term investment climate in the country. The expansion in construction activities also gave an impetus to growth in the Mining & Quarrying sector. This sector registered a growth of 6.0 per cent in 1994. Growth in the export demand for gems bolstered the performance of the export oriented mining sub-sector, whereas the Quarrying sub-sector expanded as the outcome of the enhanced domestic demand for products of this sub-sector from the Manufacturing and Construction sectors. The Services sector grew further by 5.2 per cent in 1994 compared with an expansion of 6.3 per cent in 1993, in line with the strong growth in the primary and the secondary sectors of the economy.",
