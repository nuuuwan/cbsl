    "text": "The on-going policy adjustments towards fiscal consolidation suffered a set-back in 1994 in the wake of national elections, seriously undermining macro economic stability in the country. Under the impact of various discretionary changes in taxation and the relaxation of government expenditure restraints, the revenue/GDP ratio declined to 19.0 per cent in 1994 from 19.7 per cent in 1993, while the current expenditure/GDP ratio increased from 20.5 per cent to 22.0 per cent. These developments resulted in a rise in the current account deficit from 0.8 per cent of GDP in 1993 to 2.9 per cent of GDP in 1994 reflecting a high consumption orientation in government fiscal operations. Moreover, in spite of a reduction in public investment in relation to GDP from 8 per cent in 1993 to 7 per cent in 1994, total expenditure/GDP ratio remained high at 29.0 per cent of GDP in 1994 in comparison to 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1993 owing to the enhanced level of current expenditure in the budget. Overall revenue and expenditure flows generated a budget deficit of 10 per cent of GDP in 1994 as against 8.4 per cent in 1993. The overall deficit in 1994 was slightly higher than the average deficit of 9.7 per cent in the 1989 - 1993 period. A persistently high budget deficit has been a major concern in macro economic management in recent years, particularly in the context of a sustained high demand for credit from the private sector and large capital inflows in a liberalised economic environment.",

    "text": "Government revenue at Rs.l 10,038 million in 1994, recorded a growth of 12 per cent as against 15 per cent in 1993. The growth in government revenue was far short of the nominal growth in GDP and resulted in a reduction in the revenue/GDP ratio from 19.7 per cent in 1993 to 19.0 per cent in 1994 - well below the annual average revenue/GDP ratio of 20.6 per cent realised during the 1989 - 1993 period. The weakening of the Government's revenue effort, which has been evident in the systematic fall in the Revenue/GDP ratio in recent years, not only underscored the inherent inelastic nature of the government revenue structure but was also a reflection of the adverse impact of the continued erosion of the country's tax base due to various exemptions and other discretio\u00adnary measures extended on an ad-hoc basis during the year, particularly on the eve of national elections. Thus, in spite of an additional revenue effort made through the defence levy and excise tax on selected commodities at the beginning of the year, the overall revenue effort continued to deteriorate in 1994 - a worrisome development in government fiscal operations, particularly in the context of high demands on current expenditure.",

Consequently, current expenditure as a proportion of GDP rose from 20.5 per cent in 1993 to 22.0 per cent in 1994, almost of the same order of magnitude as the annual average current expenditure/GDP ratio of 22.8 per cent realised during the 1989-1993 period.",

    "text": "Underscoring the inherent weakness in the revenue and expenditure structure as well as the resort to discretionary measures to provide temporary relief through ad-hoc revenue and expendi\u00adture measures, the fiscal operations in 1994 generated an overall deficit (before grants) of Rs.57,730 million, compared to a deficit of Rs.43,121 million in 1993. Consequently, the budget deficit/GDP ratio increased to 10.0 per cent from 8.4 per cent. With the use of foreign grants to the tune of Rs.8,257 million (1.4 per cent of GDP), the deficit (after grants) financed through foreign and domestic borrowings amounted to Rs.49,474 million (8.5 per cent of GDP) in 1994 compared to a deficit of Rs.34,096 million (6.9 per cent of GDP) in 1993. Although, concessionary foreign loans totalling Rs.l 1,778 million (2.0 per cent of GDP) together with Rs.4,797 million on account of project grants contributed towards financing about 41 per cent of public investment projects, domestic borrowings increased far in excess of the domestic resource requirement of capital projects, reaching Rs.37,696 million (6.5 per cent of GDP) in 1994 in comparison to Rs.24,241 million (4.9 per cent of GDP) in 1993, owing to the high current account deficit recorded in 1994. The adverse development in the current account operations of the budget led to a borrowing of Rs.l,157 million from the banking system, in addition to Rs.36,539 million from non-bank sources. This disturbing feature in deficit financing as such high borrowings not only pre-empt resources otherwise available to the private sector but also weaken macro economic management. Unlike in the previous five years, when the government budgetary operations relied entirely on non-bank sources, the 1994 budgetary operations resorted to the use of funds from the banking system, thereby exerting direct pressure on an already high expansion in monetary aggregates. This under\u00adscores the need for a concerted effort towards eliminating the current account deficit in government fiscal operations, if the Government is to reduce its borrowing requirement while maintaining a high level of public investment. A summary of government fiscal operations during 1990-1994 is given in Table 1.58.",

While the share of tax revenue in total revenue rose from 87 per cent in 1993 to 90 per cent in 1994, the importance of taxes on goods and services within the tax revenue structure also further heightened with its share increasing from 56 per cent in 1993 to 57 per cent in 1994. Underpinning this development was the increased revenue collection from the Defence levy and excise taxes. In spite of a nominal growth of 9 per cent in import duty collection, the share of such collection in total tax revenue, which dropped from 27 per cent in 1992 to 24 per cent in 1993, further declined to 23 per cent in 1994 owing largely to an erosion in the tax base for import duty which resulted from the grant of duty waivers and exemptions on a wide range of commodities. Meanwhile, under the influence of buoyant revenue growth of 22 per cent in income taxes, its share in total revenue increased from 13 per cent in 1993 to 14 per cent in 1994, in spite of a reduction in the maximum income tax rate from 40 per cent to 35 per cent in April, 1994.",

In spite of the increase in the value of manufactured output and a substantial rise in the value of imports, the revenue performance under turnover taxes on these transactions was not satisfactory due to numer\u00adous exemptions granted from these taxes in 1994.

Following an increase in excise tax rates on washing machines, air conditioners, fans, electrical appliances etc. and the inclusion of several other consumer durable items under the Excise (Special Provision) Act, and the full year impact of the excise tax on petrol which was introduced in October, 1993, a further sum of Rs.2,058 million was raised in 1994 compared to Rs.726 million in 1993. The increased importance of excise tax revenue in government revenue underscored the shift towards domestic taxes from international trade related taxes, which formed a strong source of revenue, particularly prior to 1990 when exports of primary commodities were subject to high export taxes and customs tariffs.",

The average import duty rate, which was 14.7 per cent in 1991, fell to 13.6 per cent in 1992. Although, the decline in the average incidence of import duty is consistent with the gradual reduction in customs tariffs in recent years, the sharp fall in customs collection was largely attributed to the grant of duty waivers on a wide range of commodities and various duty concessions extended to export industries and BOI enterprises during the year. Thus, in spite of an increase in the value of imports from Rs.l93,550 million in 1993 to Rs.236,030 million in 1994, the total value of dutiable imports rose only marginally from Rs.86,455 million in 1993 to Rs.98,871 million in 1994.",

Moreover, of the total intermediate goods valued at Rs.l 19,970 million, around 50 per cent of total imports nearly half was on account of textiles, fertilizer and wheat grain which were not subject to customs tariffs. Although, customs tariffs were rationalised in November, 1993 within a four band rate structure of 10, 20, 35 and 45 per cent for items other than motor vehicles, liquor and tobacco, the grant of duty waivers and exemptions and the creation of a new rate band of 5 per cent in mid-1994 led to a substantial erosion in the revenue base undermining both trade policy objectives and the revenue objectives of customs tariffs. The creation of the new rate band of 5 per cent for selected items was also meant to provide an exemption for such items from turnover tax on imports.",

These expenditures were around 5 per cent of GDP in 1994. A high level of expenditure on personal emoluments in the context of a limited scope for a further increase in government revenue clearly points to the fact that a further expansion in government sector employment and increases in government salaries are not sustainable in the future unless such measures are accompanied by a considerable reduction in the present level of government sector employment.",

The average interest on these loans has been around 1.8 per cent - well below the market rate for commercial loans. In contrast, interest payments on domestic debt totalling Rs.32,520 million recorded an alarming increase of 30 per cent and caused the interest on domestic debt to GDP ratio to rise from 5.0 per cent in 1993 to 5.6 per cent in 1994.

First, it accounted for a fourth of total current expenditure and absorbed 30 per cent of government revenue imposing a severe strain on fiscal management. Second, the high interest cost tended to crowd out other government expenditure, particularly productive government expenditure under various pro\u00adgrammes seriously undermining the role of the Government in such activities. Third, as markets have become competitive and government debt instruments are traded in the market, cost of interest on government debt is likely to remain high compared to the past when debt was raised at adminis\u00adtered rates of interest. Under these circumstances, concerted action is required to reduce govern\u00adment borrowings in order to correct structural imbalances in government fiscal operations.",

The 26 per cent increase in pension payments in 1994 in comparison to the 30 per cent rise in the previous year, was the combined outcome of the full year impact of the grant of Rs.260 per month on account of cost of living allowance since 1993, the payment of arrears on account of the correction of anomalies of pension payments following the May-Day package, and the new government's decision to pay arrears of cost of living allowance which was frozen in 1988.

The public investment during the past five year period averaged at 8.6 per cent of GDP compared to 13.5 per cent in the preceding five year period. The low level of public investment was due to several reasons. First, the fiscal adjustments towards lower budget deficits since 1989 were largely at the expense of public investment. Second, there has been a considerable under utilisation of foreign funded public investment projects in electricity and telecommunications due to complex tender procedures which have delayed the speedy implementa\u00adtion of such projects. Third, projects with large domestic resource content particularly in the field of education and health suffered due to lack of funds on a regular basis as government cash management was under tremendous stress on account of day to day operational expenses. This situation has also been compounded by lower disbursement on account of reimbursible foreign aid as there has been considerable slippages in the implementation of projects.

Although, gross foreign borrowings at Rs.19,384 million, showed an increase of 15 per cent in 1994, the net borrowings from foreign sources amounted to Rs.l 1,778 million as against Rs.9,855 million in 1993 due to an increase in foreign loan repayments from Rs.6,984 million in 1993 to Rs.7,606 million in 1994. Net foreign borrowings as a proportion of GDP were 2.0 per cent as was in the previous year. Reflecting a large resource gap in government budgetary operations, particularly in current account transactions, net foreign borrowings as a share of deficit (after grants) declined from 29 per cent in 1993 to 24 per cent in 1994. Thus, net domestic borrowings at Rs.37,696 million showed a phenomenal rise of 56 per cent in 1994. Consequently, domestic financing in relation to GDP increased from 4.9 per cent in 1993 to 6.5 per cent in 1994, adding a further debt burden on the budget.",

In spite of the commitment to consolidate government fiscal operations by generating a surplus in current account operations equivalent to 1.1 per cent of GDP and containing the overall budget deficit at 6.8 per cent of GDP, a weakening of revenue efforts and relaxed expenditure policies led to a considerable increase in the current account deficit to 2.9 per cent of GDP, and overall budget deficit to 10.0 per cent of GDP requiring a very high level of domestic borrowings. The govern\u00adment revenue effort was weakened due to various concessions extended through the reduction in import duties, turnover taxes and income taxes, while there was an escalation of current expendi\u00adture largely on account of various relief measures. These developments not only exerted consider\u00adable demand pressure on the economy, but also further complicated the structural problems in the government budget through the erosion in tax base and high cost on account of pensions, salaries, household transfers and interest payments. The on-going structural reforms in regard to public sector employment, rationalisation of cadre positions, administrative price corrections and the rationalisation of welfare programmes etc. to consolidate government fiscal operations thus suffered a set-back in 1994, making future fiscal adjustment more difficult.",
