    "text": "A moderate growth in the earnings of exports and a relatively high growth in the outlay on imports marked the developments in the external trade during 1994. The depressed international prices for most of the export commodities were largely responsible for the modest growth perfor\u00admance of the export sector. Total export earnings increased by 9 per cent* or SDR 189 million in 1994 compared with an appreciable 17 per cent growth (SDR 299 million) recorded in 1993. Increased earnings were recorded in all major sectors; agricultural, industrial and mineral exports, in 1994 although their respective growth rates were well below those of 1993. The expenditure on imports rose by SDR 458 million in 1994 in comparison with a growth of SDR 383 million recorded in 1993. The rate of growth was 16 per cent in 1994 which was more or less the same as in 1993. All major categories of imports recorded increases in 1994 with more pronounced growth rates in imports of investment goods and consumer goods. A decelerated growth in exports relative to imports caused the trade deficit to expand by SDR 269 million to SDR 1,093 million, in 1994, compared with the deficit of SDR 824 million in 1993.",

All major categories; agricultural, industrial and mineral exports, recorded increases in earnings. The earnings from industrial exports, which contributed 74 per cent of total export earnings in 1994, rose by 11 per cent over the earnings in 1993, largely due to increased earnings from textiles and garments (7 per cent) and other industrial exports (21 per cent). Meanwhile, earnings from agricul\u00adtural exports rose by 4 per cent largely as a result of increases in exports of coconut products (29 per cent) and rubber (11 per cent).

Depressed tea prices in 1994 are attributed to increased global supply, sluggish growth in demand from major consuming countries and availability of poor quality teas. The adverse situation in the global tea market was reflected in the Colombo auctions, where the gross sale average price dropped by 6 per cent in 1994 from that of 1993. A downward trend in prices was evident for all the elevational categories, with the prices of medium growns, which dropped by 9 per cent being affected the most. The prices of high growns dropped by 3 per cent. The low growns, which accounted for around 50 per cent of total sales at the Colombo auctions, recorded a 6 per cent drop in the average price.",

The upward movement in prices was further strengthened by a sharp drop in synthetic rubber produc\u00adtion in Russia, generating further demand for natural rubber, while cancellations and re-negotia\u00adtions in trading contracts led to strong speculative demand.

The major impetus to growth in earnings from manufactured exports came from textiles and garments and other industrial exports. The earnings from textile and garments exports rose by 7 per cent from SDR 1,009 million (Rs. 68,150 million) in 1993 to SDR 1,080 million (Rs. 76,614 million) in 1994. The deceleration in growth in the earnings of textile and garments in 1994 in comparison with the 17 per cent increase recorded in 1993 was partly a reflection of uncertainties regarding the textile quotas to the USA in the latter part of 1994 and the increase in exports of lower priced items of garments. Exports of garments to the USA, the major market for Sri Lanka's apparel exports, were adversely affected in the latter part of 1994 with the over-utilization of certain categories of quota items which subsequently led to a deferment of shipments to avoid the imposition of trade embargoes against Sri Lanka's garment exports. This issue was resolved at the end 1994, with the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement on textiles and clothing and the subsequent conversion of the USA Textile Agreement to a calendar year.",

The value of sugar imports, which accounted for 37 per cent of total expenditure under the food and drinks category in 1994, rose by 50 per cent over 1993. This was the combined outcome of increases in the volume of imports by 25 per cent and the average price by 20 per cent. Expenditure on milk and milk products increased by 12 per cent from SDR 54 million (Rs. 3,656 million) in 1993 to SDR 61 million (Rs. 4,305 million) in 1994 while the outlay on imports of fish products including dried fish rose by 17 per cent from SDR 36 million (Rs. 2,456 million) to SDR 42 million (Rs. 2,955 million) between the two years. A similar upward trend was observed in other food items, which rose by 26 per cent to SDR 101 million (Rs. 7,104 million) in 1994 from SDR 80 million (Rs. 5,397 million) in 1993. In the food and drinks category, major decreases were recorded in expenditure on rice and wheat flour. The value of rice imports declined by 73 per cent from SDR 35 million (Rs. 2,386 million) in 1993 to SDR 10 million (Rs. 655 million) in 1994, largely due to a substantial decline in the volume of imports from 208,806 metric tons to 58,434 metric tons following increased domestic paddy production. Meanwhile, the value of imports of wheat flour declined to a negligible level in 1994 from SDR 9 million (Rs. 552 million) in 1993.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka continued to promote international trade and economic co-operation through active participation in several international and regional organizations. With a view to achieving the benefits of expansion in global trade by way of lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers and strength\u00adening rules and disciplines in international trade, Sri Lanka signed the Final Act of the Uruguay Round (UR) on 15 April 1994. This was the eighth in the series of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). The implementation of the rules of the UR is crucially important for the Sri Lankan economy since it covers not only measures to lower tariff and non-tariff barriers, but also a wide spectrum of issues including the integration of textiles and clothing into the GATT, trade in agriculture and services, trade related investment measures and intellectual property rights. According to the changes in tariffs, Sri Lanka's major export items would considerably benefit from the implementation of the UR act. According to a GATT review and assessment of the proposed tariff changes, decreases in weighted tariff averages for Sri Lanka's major exports to the U.S.A., the European Union (EU) and Japan are estimated at 7 per cent, 21 per cent and 56 per cent, respectively. However, the general reduction in tariffs will lead to an erosion of preferential margins enjoyed by many developing countries lower\u00ading the significance of regional trade groupings. The integration of agriculture into the UR would generate adverse consequences on food importing developing countries like Sri Lanka in the short and medium term due to increases in commodity prices, particularly prices of wheat flour, dairy products, sugar and rice. With the implementation of the UR trade measures, the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA), which was established in 1974 to regulate and monitor the international trade in textiles and clothing through bilateral quotas, would be phased out within a period of ten years from 1995. This will provide a sufficient time period for appropriate adjustments to be carried out in Sri Lanka's textile and clothing industry to enhance efficiency and productivity so as to face competition when textile quotas are removed in the future. All MFA restraints that were in place as at 31 December 1994, are to be incorporated into the New Accord on Textile and Clothing of the UR with effect from January 1995.",

Tourist arrivals from Western Europe reached 253,899, recording a marginal increase of 1 per cent. Increased arrivals from the United Kingdom and Switzerland were, to a great extent, offset by reduced arrivals recorded from Germany, France and the Netherlands. The Asian market, the second largest source of arrivals, which was accounted for 29 per cent of the total arrivals in 1994, recorded a 9 per cent rise over the arrivals in 1993. This was largely due to the increased influx of tourists from India, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea. Following a similar trend, arrivals from North America, Eastern Europe and Australasia increased by 15 per cent, 4 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, during 1994.",
