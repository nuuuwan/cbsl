    "text": "A sustained high demand pressure, a deterioration in the external terms of trade and a reduced inflow of foreign capital led to a sharp decline in the overall surplus in the balance of payments in 1994. Under the impact of increased expenditure on imports stemming from high aggregate demand and a deterioration in the terms of trade by 4.7 per cent, the trade deficit widened from SDR 825 million (Rs.55,486 million or 11.1 per cent of GDP) in 1993 to SDR 1,095 million (Rs.77,644 million or 13.4 per cent of GDP) in 1994. In spite of some improvements in services related inflows, the surplus in the services account too declined from SDR 28 million in 1993 to SDR 12 million in 1994 owing to large outflows on account of travel and repatriation of profits and dividends, prompted by lower interest rate differentials between Sri Lanka and international markets, and unfavourable macro economic developments coupled with political uncertainty during the year. Meanwhile private transfers, which grew at a slower pace of 10 per cent in comparison to a growth of 17 per cent in the previous year, reflected the continued increase in remittances by Sri Lankan migrant workers in the Middle East, providing a strong buffer to the country's external assets. However, heavily influenced by the high trade imbalance, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) widened by SDR 250 million to SDR 646 million in 1994, raising the current account deficit/GDP ratio from 5.3 per cent in 1993 to 7.9 per cent in 1994. The.current account deficit, adjusted for official transfers of SDR 115 million (Rs.8,069 million), as a ratio of GDP increased from 3.8 per cent in 1993 to 6.5 per cent in 1994.",

    "text": "Capital account inflows showed a notable moderation in 1994. In the context of unpredictable macro economic conditions, significant policy slippages in the midst of national elections and reduced interest rate differentials between Sri Lanka and international financial markets, there was a sharp decline in portfolio investment and a considerable moderation in direct foreign investment. Net capital inflows on these accounts declined from SDR 182 million in 1993 to SDR 131 million in 1994. Underscoring continued under-utilisation of foreignaid, capital inflows to the Government too declined from SDR 334 million in 1993 to SDR 283 million in 1994. Meanwhile, net private short and long term loan capital inflows increased considerably from-SDR 240 million in 1993 to SDR 398 million in 1994, raising the country's external debt. This was largely due to the financing arrangements under the Air Lanka Reflecting Programme and private short'term trade credits land net borrowings from Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) by the enterprises under the Board of Investment (BOI). The combined impact of all transactions in the capital account was a moderate increase in net non-monetary capital from SDR 612 million (Rs.41,066 million) to-SDR 674 million (Rs.48,058 million) between the two years. Consequently, the balance of;payments recorded an overall surplus of SDR 173 million (Rs.l7;166 million) in 1994 compared to SDR 375 million (Rs.24,149 million) in the previous year. Following these developments, Sri Lanka's gross external assets rose from SDR 1,544 million (Rs. 105,258 million) at the end of 1993 to SDR 1,792 million (Rs. 130,340 million) at the end of 1994.",

    "text": "Meanwhile, with the acceptance of the obligations under the Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in March 1994, Sri Lanka removed all restrictions on current account transactions and allowed free convertibility of the Sri Lankan Rupee for such transactions. This was a major step forward under the ongoing liberalisation programme of the country. Although Sri Lanka's external assets reached a level sufficient to provide a cover for nearly 6 months of imports, the overall developments in the balance of payments front in 1994 clearly underscored the adverse impact of sustained high demand pressure on the balance of payments and the need for a stable macro economic environment through a. well conceived mon? etary and fiscal policy stance to consolidate Sri Lanka's economic strength in an open economic environment.",

    "text": "The flow of imports and exports in 1994 resulted in a marked deterioration in the trade account. The export sector showed a moderate growth of 9 per cent, with earnings increasing from SDR 2,046 million (Rs.138,174 million) in 1993 to SDR 2,236 million (Rs.158,554 million) in 1994. In 1993, the export sector grew by 17 per cent. A reduced rate of expansion was observed in all major categories of exports, i.e. agricultural, industrial and other minor exports, largely due to unfavourable export prices, particularly of tea and garments. Meanwhile, influenced by high demand for imports of investment and consumer goods, particularly sugar and consumer durables, expenditure on imports increased by 16 per cent from SDR 2,871 million (Rs. 193,660 million) in 1993 to SDR 3,331 million (Rs.236,198 million) in 1994. In addition to the increase in expenditure on imports of machinery, equipment and other capital goods required for the normal expansion of the economy, the increase in the expenditure on investment goods also reflected the import of two aircrafts at a cost of US$ 228 million by Air Lanka under its reflecting programme. Consequently, the trade deficit increased from SDR 825 million (Rs.55,486 million) to SDR 1,095 million (Rs.77,644 million) in 1994. As a ratio of GDP, the deficit increased from 11.1 per cent in 1993 to 13.4 per cent in 1994. Even after the exclusion of the exceptional item of imports, aircrafts, the trade deficit as a ratio of GDP rose from 10.3 per cent in 1993 to 11.5 per cent in 1994.",

Accordingly, the surplus in the services account declined from SDR 28 million (Rs.1,821 million) in 1993 to SDR 12 million (Rs.820 million) in 1994. On the receipts side, an improved performance was recorded in all major categories of services, particularly in port, transportation and insurance, travel and other services. With the tourist arrivals exceeding the peak level recorded in 1982 and an increase in the average spending per day per tourist, the receipts on account of travel increased by 10 per cent to SDR 161 million in 1994 compared with a 5 per cent growth in 1993.

Outflows on account of interest payments rose by SDR 17 million to SDR 161 million, while profit and dividend outflows increased by SDR 28 million to SDR 51 million.

    "text": "Net inflows in the transfers account, particularly on account of private transfers, continued to be a major source of foreign inflows to the country. Private transfers, which accounted for around 14 per cent of the total receipts on goods, services and transfers, increased from SDR 454 million (Rs.30,592 million) in 1993 to SDR 499 million (Rs.35,345 million) in 1994, largely reflecting the continued increase in remittances by Sri Lankan migrant workers, particularly in the Middle East. However, the rate of increase in inflows of private transfers declined from 17 per cent in 1993 to 10 per cent in 1994. This decline may be partly attributed to the moderation of interest sensitive transfers in response to a decline in domestic interest rates and an increase in interest rates in international markets in 1994. Meanwhile, outflows on account of private transfers increased from SDR 52 million (Rs.3,501 million) in 1993 to SDR 61 million (Rs.4,357 million) in 1994 as the full impact of the relaxation of restrictions in 1993 on the transfer of assets by Sri Lankan migrants was felt in 1994. Official transfers remained at the same level of SDR 115 million as in 1993. As the",

As a ratio of GDP, the deficit increased from 3.8 per cent in 1993 to 6.5 per cent in 1994. Excluding grants, this ratio rose from 5.3 per cent in 1993 to 7.9 per cent in 1994. This sharp deterioration in the current account after two years of continued improvement was a worri\u00adsome development in the balance of payments in 1994 as it was largely attributed to high demand pressure evident in the large Investment-Saving gap in the economy. However, high demand pressure was manifested more as an increase in investment rather than a decline in savings as the share of investment goods in total imports increased by 2.5 percentage points, while the share of consumer goods increased by only 0.2 percentage points.",

This transfer led to a repayment to FCBUs in 1993, thus causing the net lending by the FCBUs to domestic enterprises to be low in that year, resulting in a relatively low net inflow of private short term capital. Short term capital inflows in 1994 included FCBU credits to BOI enterprises towards their working capital and trade credits including credit facilities to BOI enterprises towards financing their raw material imports.",

Compared with end 1993, the US Dollar depreciated sharply against the Yen, Deutsche Mark, French Franc and the Pound Sterling in 1994, while in the domestic market there was an accumulation of net foreign assets. Consequently, between end 1993 and end 1994, the Rupee depreciated only marginally by 0.8 percent against the US dollar, the intervention currency. However, against the relatively stronger currencies in the international market, the Rupee depreciated at a higher rate, i.e. against the Japanese Yen by 11.4 per cent, the Deutsche Mark by 10.7 per cent, the French Franc by 9.1 per cent and the Pound Sterling by 5.8 per cent. It also depreciated by 1 per cent against the Indian Rupee.

Medium and long term loans of the Government, which accounted for 69 per cent of the outstanding loans as at end 1994, increased by SDR 69 million mainly on account of concessional assistance extended by Japan, the ADB and the IDA. In 1994, Sri Lanka also received the first- tranche under the third year programme of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) arrangement with the IMF, amounting to SDR 56 million. With a repayment of SDR 9 million, in respect of a loan taken earlier under the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF), the outstanding debt to the IMF increased by SDR 47 million to SDR 423 million at the end of 1994.",

While amortization payments on account of non-IMF loans increased by SDR 7 million, such payments to the IMF decreased from SDR 18 million in 1993 to SDR 9 million in 1994. Interest payments on account of IMF loans decreased marginally while interest payments on non-IMF loans increased by SDR 18 million. However, with earnings from the export of goods and services increasing at a faster rate than the debt service payments during the year, the debt service ratio decreased from 13.8 per cent in 1993 to 13.0 per cent in 1994. Debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from the exports of goods, services and private transfers decreased from 11. 8 per cent to 11.1 per cent.",
