The proposed amendments to the Banking Act have now been gazetted, pending necessary legislation being passed by the Parliament. These amendments are intended to have the effect of levelling the playing field for all licensed commercial banks in Sri Lanka, broadening the scope of supervision by bringing the hitherto unregulated financial operations such as off-shore operations of commer\u00adcial banks within the supervisory ambit of the Central Bank and strengthening the regulatory powers of the Central Bank. The proposed amendments would also make prudential regulations currently in force applicable to development finance institutions and savings banks whose opera\u00adtions have not been subject to such regulations in the Banking Act.",

The provision for bad and doubtful debts increased by 171 per cent during the financial year following the 106 per cent increase in the previous year. The primary reason for these increases in provisioning for bad and doubtful debts was the Finance Companies (Provision for Bad and Doubtful Debts) Direction No.2 issued by the Monetary Board in 1991. On the asset side, total liquid assets increased by 14.5 per cent during the financial year, while the advances, which amounted to 64 per cent of the total assets as at 31.03.93, increased by 18.8 per cent.

The relief scheme to depositors of failed finance companies which became opera\u00adtional in 1989, continued to be implemented during the year. The relief payments made to deposi\u00adtors of seven distressed finance companies during the year amounted to Rs.37.7 million. The total value of relief payments made to depositors up to the end of 1994 amounted to Rs.511.5 million. These relief payments were financed largely through loans granted by the Central Bank. One registered finance company, the administration and management of which was taken over by the Monetary Board in February 1992, was granted loans amounting to Rs.220 million during the year to meet its deposit liabilities. As at end December 1994, the total outstanding value of Central Bank loans that have been granted to this company amounted to Rs. 1,315.7 million.",

At the end of 1994,113 guarantees amounting to Rs.31.4 million had been either withdrawn or had lapsed due to non compliance by the Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) with the Central Bank's operating instructions. The total liability in respect of 338 claims received was Rs.33.9 million, of which 230 claims amounting to Rs.19.1 million were fully settled. In terms of a decision taken, 50 per cent of the liability on 27 loans granted for projects located in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the country, which were declared either in default or as failures, were paid as interim settlements amounting Rs.2.1 million. Loans relating to 37 claims amounting to Rs.2.0 million were repaid by the borrowers after submission of the claims, while 30 claims with a total value of Rs.5.5 million were rejected on account of non compliance by the PCIs with the operating instructions. Consideration of 11 claims amounting to Rs.2.6 million was de\u00adferred on account of either rehabilitation programmes undertaken by the PCIs or re-commencement of repayment of the loan by the borrowers after submission of claims. At the end of December 1994, only 40 loans amounting to Rs.4.6 million with a maximum guarantee liability of Rs.2.9 million were reported to be operational. Premia collected under this scheme and post-claim recov\u00aderies by the Central Bank amounted to Rs.12.2 million and Rs.8.4 million, respectively. Available resources made up of premia inflows and post claim recoveries amounting to Rs.20.6 million were not sufficient to meet liabilities under the scheme and a sum of Rs.0.6 million had to be met by the Central Bank.",
