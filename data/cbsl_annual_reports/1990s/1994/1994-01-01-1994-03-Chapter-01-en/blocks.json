However, a high budget deficit, a large external current account deficit and persistently high monetary growth which resulted by and large from policy slippages in the backdrop of two national elections remained major areas of concern in macro economic management in 1994. However, a significant development following the elections was the policy statement of the new Government with its commitment to pursue the process of economic liberalisation and to strengthen the market friendly economic environment which would guarantee the continuity of economic policies pursued in recent years.",

The relaxa\u00adtion of the tight fiscal policy stance resulted in large imbalances in the government fiscal operations exerting considerable demand pressure in the economy. The current account of the government budget, which generated a large deficit of 2.9 per cent of GDP, in comparison to a deficit of 0.8 per cent in the previous year, depressed the country's saving effort. Influenced by high current expendi\u00adture, the overall budget deficit increased to 10 per cent of GDP from 8.4 per cent in the previous year necessitating an enhanced level of net domestic borrowing in the order of 6.5 per cent of GDP. As a consequence of high domestic borrowings by the Government and a sustained increase in private sector credit from the banking system, monetary aggregates continued to remain under pressure resulting in an increase in money supply by 19.7 per cent.",

The decline in the savings/GDP ratio was entirely due to the deterioration in government savings. In fact, the decline in government savings (which was manifested in a rise from a negative level of 0.8 per cent of GDP in 1993 to a higher negative level 2.9 per cent of GDP in 1994) indicated that private savings continued to rise during the year. Parallel with these developments in aggregate savings and investment was the considerable deterioration in the current account of the balance of payments with the deficit rising from 3.8 per cent of GDP in 1993 to 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1994. This, together with a slowing down of capital inflows, reduced the overall surplus in the balance of payments from SDR 375 million in 1993 to SDR 173 million in 1994.",

In subsequent months, the Index was heavily influenced by various discretion\u00adary measures such as ad-hoc tariff reductions, import duty waivers, and administrative price reduc\u00adtions announced by the Government with a view to reducing the cost of living. Improved supply conditions towards the end of the year were also conducive to moderating price pressure in the economy. Thus, in spite of unabated high demand pressure in the economy, the annual inflation, as measured by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index, averaged 8 per cent for the year. However, the sustained high monetary expansion continued to underscore considerable infla\u00adtionary pressure in the economy during 1994. Unless this demand pressure is reduced through a durable reduction in the budget deficit, and the underlying structural constraints in the economy, which are discussed subsequently, are eliminated, it will be difficult to sustain high economic growth with price stability over the medium term.",

Private consumption expenditure at Rs.435 billion recorded a growth of 16.4 per cent in comparison to an increase of 16.6 per cent in the previous year. Continuing the pattern observed in 1993, private consumption expenditure on imported goods and non-factor services rose at a higher rate (24 per cent) than the expenditure on domestically produced goods (13.6 per cent). Within imported consumer goods, food and beverages and con\u00adsumer durables such as motor vehicles and electrical goods recorded a significant growth. The rate of growth in government consumption expenditure accelerated from 11.8 per cent in 1993 to 22.5 per cent in 1994 mainly due to a sharp increase in government current expenditure on the purchase of goods and services by 22 per cent during the year.",

Government savings declined from a negative level of 0.8 per cent of GDP to 2.9 per cent of GDP. This in fact suggests that the private savings/GDP ratio increased from 16.8 per cent in 1993 to 17.9 per cent in 1994. Meanwhile, under the impact of lower aggregate domestic savings, national savings, i.e. domestic savings adjusted for net private transfers and net factor income from abroad, in relation to GDP declined from 20.3 per cent in 1993 to 19.1 per cent in 1994.

In spite of a decline of about o.l per cent in the other agriculture sub-sector, which accounts for about 50 per cent of total agriculture, the sustained increase in the production of tea, paddy and coconut contributed to the overall increase in output in the Agricul\u00adtural sector in 1994. The continued favourable weather conditions were conducive to sustaining a high level of production particularly in tea and paddy. In plantation agriculture, the production of tea, rubber and coconut recorded growth rates of 4.8 per cent, 1.0 per cent and 20.6 per cent, respectively, in 1994. The substantial growth in the output of coconut was due to the lagged effect of favourable weather conditions in 1993. Meanwhile, paddy production increased by 4.7 per cent. The significant production gains in these major crops were somewhat offset by the weaker perform\u00adance in the other agriculture sub-sector, whose aggregate output declined by 0.1 per cent. Within the other agriculture sub sector, an increase in output was recorded in subsidiary food crops, sugar cane, animal husbandry and dairy products, but the output of minor export crops, vegetables and fruits suffered a setback. The growth rate in the fisheries sub-sector declined to 1.4 per cent in 1994 from 7.1 per cent in 1993, while the forestry sub-sector registered a marginal decline as in the",

Within Manufacturing, factory industry, the most important sub-sector in terms of contribution to value-addition and export earnings, grew by 8.8 per cent in 1994 in comparison to a growth of 11.3 per cent in the previous year. The growth in factory industry was affected by the disruptions in industrial activities, uncertainties in the availability of quotas in certain categories of garments to the USA and weakened investor confidence in the context of policy slippages during the year. The industrial categories under factory industry that recorded strong performance in 1994 were food and beverages, textiles, apparel and leather products and non-metallic mineral products. The growth in output of plantation agriculture enabled the value-added in the processing industries of tea, rubber and coconut products to increase by 13 per cent in real terms, as against 8.4 per cent in 1993. With increasing economic activity and spin-offs from the factory industries, the small industries sub-sector is estimated to have expanded by 5.7 per cent in 1994. The other-industries sub-sector grew by 6.8 per cent, compared to 6.4 per cent in 1993. The expansion in the rice milling industry was the most conspicuous factor affecting the growth in this industrial category.",

The Wholesale and Retail Trade sector recorded an overall growth of 6.4 per cent, primarily due to the expansion in import and export trade. The high rainfall during the year contributed to an increase in the generation of hydro electricity by 7.7 per cent in 1994. This, together with an expansion in the supply of pipe-borne water, was the major contributory factor to a high rate of growth in the Electricity, Water, Gas and Sanitary services sector. The Banking, Finance and Real Estate sector grew by 9.5 per cent in 1994 compared with a growth of 10.8 per cent in 1993. With greater diversification in financial services, the banking sub-sector remained robust during the year under review.

The output of low grown teas, which increased by 28 per cent to 112 million kg in 1993, further rose by 5 per cent to 118 million kg in 1994. The output of high grown teas rose by 6 per cent to record 77 million kg, while medium grown teas virtually remained at the 1993 level of 47 million kg. Meanwhile, CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea production expanded by 40 per cent to 11.2 million kg in 1994. Consequently, the share of CTC teas increased to 4 per cent of the total production in 1994 from 3 per cent in 1993.",

This was in sharp contrast to the performance in 1993 when payments increased at a slower rate. Accordingly, the surplus in the services account declined from SDR 28 million (Rs.l,821 million) in 1993 to SDR 12 million (Rs.820 million) in 1994. On the receipts side, an improved performance was recorded in all major categories of services, particularly in the case of port, transportation and insurance, travel and other services. With the tourist arrivals exceeding the peak level recorded in 1982 and an increase in the average spending per day per tourist, the receipts on account of travel increased by 10 per cent to SDR 161 million in 1994 compared with a 5 per cent growth observed in 1993. However, there was also a substantial increase in the outflows on account of travel reflecting increased travel abroad by Sri Lankan residents. As a result, net receipts on account of travel declined from SDR 60 million to SDR 43 million.",

    "text": "Net inflows in the transfers account, particularly those in respect of private transfers continued to be a major source of foreign inflows to the country. Private transfers which accounted for around 14 per cent of the total receipts on goods, services and transfers, increased from SDR 454 million (Rs.30,592 million) in 1993 to SDR 499 million (Rs.35,345 million) in 1994 largely reflecting the continued increase in the remittances by Sri Lankan migrant workers particularly in the Middle East. However, the rate of increase in inflows of private transfers declined from 17 per cent in 1993 to 10 per cent in 1994. This may be partly attributed to the moderation of interest sensitive transfers in response to a decline in domestic interest rates and an increase in interest rates in major interna\u00adtional markets in 1994. Meanwhile, outflows on account of private transfers increased from SDR 52 million (Rs.3,501 million) in 1993 to SDR 61 million (Rs.4,357 million) in 1994 as the full impact of the relaxation of restrictions in 1993 on the transfer of assets by Sri Lankan migrants was felt in 1994. Official transfers remained at the 1993 level of SDR 115 million. As the combined outcome of the private and official transfers, net inflows in the transfers account increased from SDR 517 million (Rs.34,839 million) in 1993 to SDR 552 million (Rs.39,057 million) in 1994.",

As a ratio of GDP, the deficit increased from 3.8 per cent to 6.5 per cent between 1993 and 1994. This ratio excluding grants increased from 5.3 per cent in 1993 to 7.9 per cent in 1994. This sharp deteriora\u00adtion in the current account after two years of continued improvement was a worrisome development in the Balance of Payments in 1994 as it was largely attributed to a high demand pressure build up in the economy during 1994.",

Net inflows of foreign capital on portfolio investment also declined from SDR 48 million in 1993 to SDR 20 million in 1994. In fact, sales of shares by non-residents at the Colombo Stock Exchange exceeded purchases in the months of March, April and the last quarter of 1994.

The movements of the Rupee reflected the fluctuations in the cross rates of major currencies due to volatile conditions in international foreign exchange and financial markets as well as the conditions that prevailed in the foreign exchange market in Sri Lanka. Compared with end 1993, the US dollar depreciated sharply against the Yen, Deutsche Mark, French Franc and the Pound Sterling in 1994. Accordingly, the Rupee depreciated by 0.8 percent against the US dollar, the intervention currency from end 1993 to end 1994. However, against the relatively stronger currencies in the international market, the Rupee depreciated at a higher rate, i.e. against the Japanese Yen by 11.4 per cent, the Deutsche Mark by 10.7 per cent, the French Franc by 9.1 per cent and the Pound Sterling by 5.8 per cent. It also depreciated by 1 per cent against the Indian Rupee. The composite outcome of the movements against major currencies was the depreciation of the Sri Lanka Rupee by 6.3 per cent against the SDR compared with 7.1 per cent in the previous year.",

Medium and long term loans of the Government, which accounted for 69 per cent of the outstanding loans at end 1994, increased by SDR 69 million mainly on account of concessional assistance extended by Japan, the ADB and the IDA. In 1994, Sri Lanka received the first tranche under the third year arrangements of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) with the IMF, amounting to SDR 56 million. With the repayment of SDR 9 million of a loan taken earlier under the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF), the outstanding debt to the IMF increased by SDR 47 million to SDR 423 million at the end of 1994.",

Total tax revenue at Rs.99,417 million accounted for 90 per cent of government revenue in 1994. The importance of taxes on goods and services within the tax revenue structure also further strengthened with the increase in such revenue from Rs.47,963 million (56 per cent) to Rs.56,685 million (57 per cent) in 1994. Underpinning this development was the increased revenue collection from the Defence Levy and excise taxes. Import duty collections, at Rs.22,598 million, recorded a 9 per cent increase and accounted for 23 per cent of tax revenue in 1994. Meanwhile, reflecting a buoyant growth, income taxes increased from Rs.12,543 million in 1993 to Rs.15,277 million in 1994 in spite of a reduction in the maximum income tax rate from 40 per cent to 35 per cent in April 1994.",

A reduction in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the Central Bank by Rs.2,700 million, mainly through the issuance of Central bank securities, and a gradual reduc\u00adtion in Central Bank refinance credit helped to contain the increase in reserve money to Rs.l 1,588 million in 1994 from Rs.l 1,609 million during the previous year.

With a limited holding of Treasury bills in its portfolio, the ability of the Central Bank to engage in open market operations to absorb excess liquidity was seriously constrained. Thus, despite the net issue of the Central Bank's own securities worth Rs.635 million and a reduction in Treasury bills held by Central Bank by Rs.3,908 million by end February 1994, the excess liquidity in the market led to a drop in the average yields on Treasury bills. Consequently, the average yield on 3-month Treasury bills dipped to 14.43 per cent by the end of February 1994 from 18.09 at the beginning of the year, while the 6-month Treasury bill rate fell to 14.88 per cent from 18.47 per cent and the 12-month rate fell to 15.63 per cent from 19.38 per cent.

The complete exemption of items such as lentils from customs duty compelled domestic agricultural producers of similar products to compete at international prices.

These distortions led to an increase in the consumption of diesel which is now growing at around 10 per cent per year owing to the relative price advantage of diesel. This has implications not only for the government budget but also for the country's imports. In the face of high international prices for fertilizer, an across the board subsidy of 30 per cent on fertilizer was introduced in October 1994. Apart from causing considerable price distortions in domestic food prices, the subsidies on wheat flour, bread and fertilizer are estimated to cost about 1 per cent of GDP in 1995 compounding the difficulties in making fiscal adjustments.",

The continued implementation of economic reforms tended to be overlooked in favour of short term populist policies. Admittedly, these measures led to some short term benefits to the consumer. However, whether such measures can improve income and employment opportunities and ultimately maintain high economic growth and the well being of the people on a sustainable basis is a matter that requires careful analysis. The provision of various relief measures through reductions in administered prices, tax exemptions and direct budgetary grants would lead to an increasing budget deficit. Apart from the budgetary cost, which would ultimately necessitate high taxes on the remaining tax base or would result in high inflation and high interest rates, such measures discourage production and exports and encourage consumption and imports with the consequent reduction in employment and overall well being of the people.",

Evidence from high performing Asian economies suggests that rapid growth compatible with distributional objectives and the well being of the people can be achieved through the adoption of correct economic polices. The rapid progress in high performing economies and recent research on the subject have made it clear that there is no inevitable trade-off between growth and equity and that what happens to poverty during growth is determined in a large measure by policy. The question facing economic policy, therefore, is not the trade-off between growth and equity, but how to ensure that growth reduces poverty and inequality in income. A broad consensus is emerging today that broad-based sustainable economic growth that generates employment is the key to a rapid reduction in poverty and income inequality. The essential characteristics of such a growth strategy include prudent macro economic policies, outward oriented production, increased private sector participation, flexible labour markets, an efficient financial system and a strong infrastruc\u00adture base.",

As highlighted in the previous year's annual report, a persistently high inflationary pressure in Sri Lanka in recent years was due to (a) high budget deficits, (b) sustained increase in money supply, (c) low productivity, and (d) the resulting inflationary expectations. Fiscal imbalances in Sri Lanka have remained excessively above the desired level for macro economic stability. The current account of the budget has been in deficit for several years in the recent past reflecting a high consumption orientation in government fiscal operations. The budget deficit averaged nearly 10.0 per cent of GDP during the 1989 - 1994 period and domestic borrowings remained around 5.0 per cent of GDP. Deficit financing by creat\u00ading domestic debt has resulted in a high debt burden on the budget. High domestic borrowing by the Government is one of the major factors affecting the prevailing high interest rate structure in the country. Heavy reliance on domestic borrowings by the Government has pre-empted resources otherwise available to the private sector, constraining the full exploitation of the country's growth potential. In the context of large capital inflows stimulated by economic reforms and very high credit needs of the emerging private sector, high budget deficits frustrate the monetary policy effort to contain liquidity at levels consistent with price stability.",

Although such action consists of revenue augmenting measures and expenditure restraint policies in the short run, far reaching structural reforms in the government budget are necessary to find a durable solution to the country's emerging macro economic prob\u00adlems. In spite of a generally high revenue effort, the Government has not been able to maintain an elastic revenue structure in recent years due to the grant of various tax concessions, exemptions and ad hoc waivers which have resulted in a considerable erosion in the tax base. Many complexities in the tax system have also not been helpful for the improvement in tax administration. The systematic decline in the revenue/GDP ratio from 21.4 per cent in 1989 to 19.0 per cent in 1994 underscored these weaknesses in the country's revenue system. It is, therefore, necessary to pursue policy reforms towards a simple broad based tax structure which will improve the built in elasticity in revenue, ensure high compliance and facilitate tax administration.",

While the salary structure for managerial categories has become completely out of line with that of other categories which received substantial salary increases under the recent reforms, wage costs have risen due to the bottom heavy nature of public service. Meanwhile, the cost of govern\u00adment pensions and retirement benefits has increased three-fold between 1990 and 1994, in the context of increased life expectancy and a large number of retirees each year.

However, the same cannot be said of the agricultural sector which have not been liberalised. The removal of licensing requirements and the use of an appropriate tariff structure to create the necessary protection and incentive structure is vital for the exploitation of the full potential in domestic agriculture. At present, the tariff structure is very distortionary. A number of agricultural items such as wheat flour and lentils are not subject to import duties, thus making their relative prices disadvantageous to domestic production of substitutes. The relative prices in agricul\u00adture have also been distorted by the recently introduced wheat flour subsidy which has shifted consumer preferences away from domestic products. The correction of these distortions and the restoring of correct price signals, although affecting the cost of living in the short run, particularly in the urban areas, will have to be made in the interests of promoting food production in the country. Economic reforms to achieve rapid economic growth and alleviate poverty must tackle the problem of low productivity in domestic agriculture as the majority of Sri Lanka's poor resides in rural areas and are predominantly engaged in farm activities. The infusion of capital, technology and modern methods of farming to these areas and the expansion of the marketing network are necessary to raise productivity in domestic agriculture.",

Demand for electricity, for example, is growing at around 10 per cent per annum at present, but the capacity has not increased during the last four years. Moreover, the utilisation of existing capacity largely depends on exogenous factors such as weather conditions making the power supply increasingly vulnerable to non-controllable factors.
