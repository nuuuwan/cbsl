Meanwhile, rubber production in 1994, at 105 million kg., indicated a marginal improvement over the previous year.

This was the highest ever production recorded so far. Favourable weather conditions that prevailed during the year under review coupled with better management, contributed to the improved performance. The output of low grown teas, which increased by 28 per cent to 112 million kg. in 1993, further rose by 5 per cent to 118 million kg. in 1994. The output of high grown teas rose by 6 per cent to record 77 million kg., while that of medium grown teas virtually remained at the 1993 level. Meanwhile, the CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea production expanded by 40 per cent to 11.2 million kg. in 1994. Consequently, the share of CTC teas increased to 4 per cent of the total production in 1994 from 3 per cent in 1993.",

Coffee production which recorded a 39 per cent decline in the previous year improved significantly by 83 per cent to reach 3,687 metric tons in 1994. The improvement in coffee production is attributed to the favourable weather conditions and the enhanced application of fertilizer in 1994. Cardamom production which declined by 30 per cent in 1993, recorded a 33 per cent increase to 40 metric tons in 1994. However, cardamom production has been on a declining trend since 1990, mainly due to the restriction imposed on commercial cultivation activities in forest lands above an elevation of 1,062 meters. Nearly 60 per cent of the area under cardamom is situated in these restricted areas. The output of cinnamon quills recorded a 2 per cent growth to 9,696 metric tons, while the output of cocoa too increased marginally to 1,463 metric tons. The output of cloves and nutmeg remained unchanged at the 1993 level. Pepper, which recorded peak production in 1993, recorded a marginal drop in output to 4,694 metric tons in 1994. The drop in production has been attributed to a physiological strain on the plants after heavy bearing in the previous season.",

Meanwhile, the milk collection of Nestle Lanka Limited too declined by 9 per cent to 34 million litres. The producer price of milk was raised from Rs.9.25 per litre to Rs. 10.00 per litre with effect from 1st January 1994 to meet the increasing cost of production. The producer price of milk was again increased by a further 54 cents per litre to Rs.10.54 per litre from 1st April 1994.",
