Under the impact of private sector credit growth of 21 per cent and public sector net credit expansion of 4 per cent, domestic credit rose sharply by 14.7 per cent compared to a growth of 3.5 per cent at the end of the previous year. However, reflecting a lower surplus in the overall balance of payments, the growth in net foreign assets (NFA) moderated at 37.7 per cent as against a sharp rise of 87.9 per cent in 1993, easing pressure on monetary expansion.",

On the source side, the accumulation of net foreign assets with the Central Bank, which grew by Rs. 14,288 million, continued to be the main contributory factor for the expansion in reserve money. A reduction in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the Central Bank by Rs.2,700 million, mainly through the issuance of Central Bank securities, and a gradual reduction in Central Bank refinance credit, helped to contain the increase in reserve money to Rs.l 1,588 million in 1994. The increase in reserve money during the previous year was Rs.l 1,609 million. However, as a consequence of the higher growth rate in reserve money in relation to the growth rate in money supply (M2), the money multiplier - the ratio between money supply and the monetary base - declined marginally from 2.86 at the end of 1993 to 2.84 at the end of 1994 underpinning a strong preference for transaction demand for money as was evident in the rise in the currency/deposit ratio from 24.8 per cent in 1993 to 25.2 per cent in 1994.",

    "text": "In spite of high liquidity in the economy, the ability of the Central Bank to conduct intensified open market operations during 1994 was constrained by a depleted stock of Treasury bills in the Bank's portfolio. With this constraint, the Central Bank continued to issue its own securities to mop up excess liquidity, while allowing market clearance of all maturing Treasury bills that were re-issued at the primary Treasury bills auctions. Moreover, the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR), which was raised to 15 per cent in August 1993 in respect of rupee deposit liabilities as well as foreign currency deposit liabilities, was kept at the same level. However, the SRR applicable on foreign currency deposits placed abroad was reduced to 5 per cent in February 1994 with a view to encouraging commercial banks to increase their foreign currency holdings abroad and thereby reducing the pressure on reserve money expansion. In addition, the Central Bank also terminated short term refinance credit and refrained from granting new credit under the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund (MLCF) to moderate the liquidity expansion.",

Meanwhile, the capital base, including paid up capital, reserve fund and undistributed profits, increased by 29.4 per cent (Rs.6,428 million) during the year. This was due in part to the banks increasing their capital base to comply with the requirement of the risk weighted capital adequacy ratio under the Basle Agreement. Banks were required to maintain these ratios from 1994. Domestic inter-bank borrowings increased by 15.7 per cent (Rs.l,434 million) while foreign borrowings increased marginally by 0.8 per cent (Rs.l6.7 million). Other liabilities of commercial banks dropped by 3.8 per cent (Rs.l,969 million) during the year under review.",

Thus, despite the net issue of the Central Bank's own securities worth Rs.635 million and a reduction in Treasury bills held by the Central Bank by Rs.3,908 million by end February 1994, the excess liquidity in the market led to a drop in the average yields on Treasury bills. Accordingly, the average yield on 3-month Treasury bills dipped to 14.43 per cent by the end of February 1994 from 18.09 at the beginning of the year, while the 6-month Treasury bill rate fell to 14.88 per cent, from 18.47 per cent and the 12-month rate fell to 15.63 per cent from 19.38 per cent.

Further issues of Treasury bills and Central Bank Securities in April and May were conducive to sustaining the upward trend in interest rates. Consequently, by the end of June, the average yield rate on 3-month Treasury bills rose to 15.39 per cent, while the yield on 6-month and 12-month bills had risen to 15.62 per cent and 15.87 per cent, respectively.",

Meanwhile, the Central Bank was com\u00adpelled to intensify its open market operations to dampen the high rate of growth of monetary aggregates through the issue of Rs.2,510 million of its own Securities. These factors saw a steep rise in interest rates in December 1994. By the end of December, the yield on 3-month Treasury bills rose to 18.73 per cent, while the 6-month and 12-month rates rose to 19.29 per cent and 19.43 per cent, respectively. Thus, within the two months from end October to end December, interest rates on 3-month, 6-month and 12-month bills rose by 7.15 - 7.58 percentage points. However, in spite of the sharp rise in the yield on Treasury bills, the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills increased from Rs.l,433 million at the end of October, to Rs.5,093 million at the end of December, fuelling reserve money expansion. The most noteworthy development in the Treasury bill market during 1994 was the over subscription of Primary Treasury bill auctions on most occasions.",

    "text": "Meanwhile, the repurchase market introduced by the Central Bank in October 1993, partly to prevent excessive fluctuations in inter-bank call money market rates, succeeded, in general, in preventing drastic declines in rates. However, at certain times when the portfolio of bills held by the Central Bank was exhausted, significant drops in the call money rates were observed. Call market rates, which were in the range of 16.50-18.50 per cent at the end of December 1993, had declined, but to a wider range of 05.00-15.00 per cent, by the end of March. The Central Bank's overnight repurchase yield rate had also been gradually reduced from 16.5 per cent at the end of 1993 to 12.00 per cent by the end of March, in line with market developments. The overnight repurchase rate was maintained at this level, with minor variations, until mid-September. Call money rates at this time were at very low levels and hence the overnight repurchase rate was further decreased in steps to 7.00 per cent by mid-October. Call market rates were in the range of 04.00-08.00 per cent in the middle of September, but rose gradually to a range of 12.25-13.50 per cent by the end of October. The lack of market liquidity in the last two months of the year was also reflected in the call money market with rates rising to a range of 13.00-17.00 per cent at the end of November and to 20.00-23.00 per cent at the end of December. The Central Bank's overnight repurchase rate was also raised, reaching 13.75 per cent at the end of November and 20.00 per cent at the end of December.",

Effective from 01 April 1994, the scope of the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) was modified by substituting a bank financed lending programme with an interest subsidy from the Government, for cheaper Central Bank refinance hitherto available to lending banks. Under the revised Scheme, lending banks commenced lending to fanners out of their own funds, and, in order to maintain lending rates at the prevailing 16 per cent per annum, an interest subsidy of 7.5 per cent was paid by the Treasury. The termination of Central Bank refinance was prompted by the infla\u00adtionary nature of such refinance and the obviation of the need for such outside funding in view of the improved liquidity position of banks. Accordingly, the new Scheme came into force from Yala 1994. The NCRCS remained unchanged with respect to its other features, such as the roll-over facility and the Central Bank credit guarantee cover.",

Under this relief scheme which became effective from Maha 1994/95, defaulting farmers were permitted to have their loan accounts cleaned by a payment of 25 per cent of the principal sum in default. Once the farmers opted to join this scheme, the balance sum of 75 per cent plus the accumulated interest was to be written-off by banks in a joint programme with the Central Bank and the Government. Such farmers were eligible to receive full credit facilities as in the case of normal borrowers. A limited credit facility to cover the cost of seed and fertilizer was also granted by the two state banks, at the Government's instance, to those who did not opt to make the down-payment of 25 per cent. For such farmers, the credit facility during Maha 1994/95 was limited to Rs.4,000 if the extent of the land cultivated was below two acres and to Rs.8,000 if it exceeded two acres.",

However, the total number of loans granted under the NCRCS declined from 63,864 in 1993 to 58,836 in 1994. The higher volume of credit disbursed in 1994 could therefore be attributed to the upward revision in the scales of financing of cultivation loans which came into effect in November 1993. Of the total amount of credit disbursed under the NCRCS in 1994, Rs.633 million was provided by banks during the Maha 1993/94 season under the Central Bank Refinance Facility, while Rs.343 million was disbursed by banks utilizing their own funds during the Yala 1994 season. The latter disburse\u00adments were eligible for an interest subsidy of 7.5 per cent per annum provided by the Government. The major share of the loans granted under the NCRCS was for the cultivation of paddy, which accounted for 69 per cent of the total credit disbursed in 1994. The balance 31 per cent was disbursed for the cultivation of subsidiary food crops.",

The premia collected in respect of the area insured amounted to Rs.l7 million in 1994, indicating an increase of 18 per cent over 1993. The most significant feature of the AIB operations was the massive increase in indemnity payments which totalled Rs.27 million in 1994 compared with Rs.6 million in 1993. This four-fold increase was due to 100 per cent indemnity payments made by AIB for loan defaults resulting from extensive crop damage caused by floods in the North Central and Eastern Provinces during the 1993/94 Maha cultivation season. Indemnity payments for the Maha season rose to Rs.20 million in 1994 which was double the amount paid by the AIB in 1993.",

As has been the case in the recent past, the major influence in determining interest rates in the money market was the yield rate movements in the Treasury bill market. The yield rates on Central Bank securities, which continued to be issued to mop up excess liquidity, were closely related to the yield rates on Treasury bills. The continued high inflow of net foreign assets in the early part of the year and the relative slowing down of inflows towards the end of the year had an impact on the liquidity in the market and hence on market interest rates. The repurchase arrangements for Treasury bills introduced by the Central Bank in October 1993 served to minimize sudden large drops in interest rates at the short end of the money market.",

New issues of Treasury bills by the Government for budgetary purposes amounted to Rs.5.5 billion, while bills to the value of Rs. 3.8 billion were retired. Thus, in 1994, the net value of new Treasury bills issued was Rs.1.7 billion. Consequently, the total face value of Treasury bills outstanding rose from Rs.97.2 billion at the end of 1993, to Rs.98.9 billion at the end of 1994. Treasury bill holdings by the Central Bank, which stood at Rs.3.9 billion at the end of 1993, declined to a negligible level by September. However, with reduced market liquidity and increased issues in the last quarter, Central Bank holdings rose to Rs.5.1 billion at the end of 1994. This accounted for 5.7 per cent of total outstand\u00ading Treasury bills, in comparison to a holding of 4.8 per cent at the end of 1993. Of the total value of Treasury bills issued in the primary market in 1994, Rs.20.1 billion (11.9 per cent) was purchased by the Central Bank, Rs.101.9 billion by commercial banks (60.6 per cent) and Rs.46.3 billion (27.5 per cent) by others. However, reflecting intra-market activity, the distribution of outstanding Treasury bills on the basis of book value at the end of 1994 was: 5.7 per cent Central Bank, 16.8 per cent commercial banks and 77.5 per cent others.",

The repo rate for overnight bills, which stood at 16.50 per cent at the end of 1993, was gradually reduced to 11.50 per cent by the end of June. It was raised slightly in July and August, but was reduced again to 10.00 per cent in September.

The issue price of the new issues ranged from par (Rs.10.00) to Rs.100.00 (i.e., a pre\u00admium of Rs.90.00). The perception of investors with regard to anticipated future market behaviour could be gauged to some extent by the fact that the issues made in the first three quarters of the year were heavily oversubscribed (in one instance, the subscription being over 42 times the market offer), while the issues in the last quarter were undersubscribed. A total of 139.4 million shares was on offer in 1994 (for a total par value of Rs.l,394.0 million) in comparison to a total of 49.0 million shares on offer in 1993 (total par value of Rs. 490.5 million). The total value of the market offer (inclusive of premium) in 1994 was Rs.3,075.0 million in comparison to a market offer of Rs.1,246.8 million in 1993.

    "text": "The decline in prices in the market in 1994 is generally attributed to a reduction in purchases by non-nationals. The rapid upward movement in the price indices in 1993 and in the first two months of 1994 were caused, to a large extent, by the inflow of funds to the market from non-national investors. In 1993, non-national purchases accounted for 51 per cent of total turnover while non-national sales were 33 per cent of turnover. Non-national purchases amounted to 155 per cent of non-national sales. Similarly, in the period January to February 1994, non-national pur\u00adchases accounted for 45 per cent of turnover, while non-national sales were 28 per cent of turnover. Non-national purchases amounted to 159 per cent of non-national sales. After February however, affected both by domestic political uncertainty and rising interest rates in the developed financial markets, non-national purchases declined. For the year as a whole, non-national purchases ac\u00adcounted for 42 per cent of turnover, while non-national sales accounted for 38 per cent of total turnover. Non-national purchases amounted to 110 per cent of non-national sales.",
