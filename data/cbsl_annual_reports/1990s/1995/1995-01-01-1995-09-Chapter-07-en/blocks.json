This reflected a marginal drop of 1.4 per cent over the previous year, reversing the increasing trend observed during the past two years. This drop was entirely attributable to a decline of 8.9 per cent in the semi-government sector.

The increase in the government sector was largely reflected in the occupational category of clerical and related workers. The appointment of Samurdhi animators and managers for",

The agricultural sector absorbed 45 per cent of the labour force in 1990. This share had dropped to 34 per cent by 1994, in line with the trend in its relative contribution to GDP. The declining share of the agricultural sector is largely attributable to sluggish growth and limited job opportunities in this sector, as compared to prospects in the manufacturing and services sectors. The uncertainty of a regular source of income in the agricultural sector has been another contributory factor to the gradual decline of labour absorption by that sector. The declining trend in the agricultural sector share of the total employed was partly reversed in 1995, and rose to 37 per cent, with the 7 per cent growth in agricultural employment over 1994.",
