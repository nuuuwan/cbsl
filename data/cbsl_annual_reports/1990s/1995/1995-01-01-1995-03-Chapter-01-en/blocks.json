The increase was attributed to the higher extent harvested and an improvement in the yield. The average yield in 1995 registered a 5 per cent improvement to 3,535 kg per hectare, attributed largely to a 17 per cent increase in fertiliser use and liberal availability of credit.

It is noteworthy that inflation has declined during the last five years from a peak of 21.5 per cent in 1990, and that 1995 was the second successive year to record a single digit increase in the index since 1987. The other available aggregate price indicators such as the Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index and the Gross National Product Implicit Price Deflator also indicated a notable reduction in inflation. The drop in the annual average inflation rate was attributed to improved supplies of basic food items, reduction of import duties, an improved distribution network for consumer goods, particularly the dynamic trade policy",

The increase in the supply of some major agricultural commodities such as paddy, coconuts and onions as a result of favourable weather conditions and the importation of major food commodities during periods of shortage were other factors responsible for containing price increases during the year. Thus, there was only a moderate increase in prices instead of the high prices generally observed towards the end of the year. The gradual reduction of the wheat flour subsidy influenced the behaviour of prices during the second half of the year. At end 1995, the CCPI had increased by 11.5 per cent on a December to December basis, after a dip in 1994.",

The WTO signified a major move towards a harmonious world trading system with minimal distortions. It brought virtually all sectors of international trade into the multilateral trading system, including services, intellectual property rights, agriculture and textiles and clothing. Deep tariff cuts, removal of non-tariff barriers, including the planned phasing out of quotas under the Multi Fibre Agreement by the year 2005, are expected to create a more competitive trading environment in the near future. The European Union too continued its move towards the final objective of removing economic barriers amongst its members. Regional trading blocks including the ASEAN countries and the SAARC countries continued to strengthen their ties.",

With improved export performance and a sharp drop in the growth of imports, the trade deficit narrowed significantly by SDR 168 million, or 2.5 per cent of GDP. This improvement in the trade account, together with a small surplus in the services account and higher net private transfer receipts, reduced the current account deficit from SDR 526 million in 1994 to SDR 358 million in 1995. The current deficit as a percentage of GDP dropped from 6.5 per cent in 1994 to 4.2 per cent in 1995.",

The drop in imports arose from a reduction in capital good imports and in the demand for imports of durable consumer goods.

However, direct foreign investment and privatisation proceeds together, dropped sharply to a third of the 1994 level due to the cautious attitude of foreign private investors owing to labour unrest, uncertainties regarding the domestic security situation and the completion of large capital projects.

A sharp expansion in net foreign assets arising from large capital inflows during the last five years fuelled monetary growth. This was absent in 1995, as there was an overall deficit in the balance of payments. Thus, the growth in money was essentially caused by a rise in domestic credit. The challenge faced by the Central Bank in formulating monetary policy in 1995 was, therefore, to contain the credit growth, thus avoiding the ill-effects of an unacceptably high rate of monetary expansion, while ensuring that the system had sufficient liquidity to avoid stifling economic activity. The monetary policy continued to be tight during the year. The high Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) of 15 per cent was maintained throughout the year. However, to ensure that productive economic activities were not unduly suppressed by liquidity tightness and very high interest rates, the Central Bank relaxed its tight monetary policy somewhat by purchasing Treasury bills and permitting limited foreign borrowing by financial institutions towards end 1995.",

The rediscount rate, which is charged on Treasury bill sales to the Central Bank, was also reduced. Further, the Central Bank decided in late December that effective from the beginning of 1996, commercial banks would be permitted to borrow abroad, upto 5 per cent of their capital and reserves. This measure was also another step towards liberalising capital transactions. The Bank also used moral suasion to discourage commercial banks from lending to their customers for speculative purposes.

While an attempt was made to codify the working conditions and rights of labour in the form of a Workers' Charter, employers and investors expressed misgivings about the move, entirely influenced by the spate of strikes. Workers and employers are well aware of the need to remain competitive in the world market and that it will be important to build up a spirit of co-operation. The Government will have to be mindful of the need to create greater flexibility in the labour market, especially in the context of a large unemployed workforce. A recognition by all parties of the need to link wage increases to productivity increases will have to be the basis of all wage negotiations in export oriented industries, which face stiff competition.",

    "text": "In addition to the common problems faced by the industrial sector in general, some textile manufacturers who relied on the local market experienced serious marketing problems due mainly to competition from imported and smuggled textiles. The gradual reduction of import tariffs on textiles from 100 per cent in 1993 to 35 per cent in 1995 also reduced the protection enjoyed by the domestic textile industry. The textile production of seven major manufacturers dropped by 17 per cent in 1995. While the loss of employment and output in the textile manufacturing industry is a matter for serious concern, one would also need to weigh the gains to consumers against the losses to producers that result from enhanced competition. The enhanced competition would improve resource allocative efficiency and compel firms to be more cost effective and improve product quality. In fact, more efficient producers who targeted their output to export markets survived under the new challenges. However, the interests of local manufacturers who need more time for adjustment could be safeguarded through enhanced surveillance at the ports. The local textile industry needs investment in modern technology, together with greater dynamism, to be cost effective and competitive, as further tariff cuts are expected in the medium-term.",

Excessive growth in monetary aggregates affects the price level both directly and indirectly. If the money supply is permitted to increase beyond a certain level, given the limited existing production capacity, the consequence would be an increase in aggregate demand and a rise in the general price level. A more insidious, and perhaps potentially more dangerous, effect of a continued increase in money supply would be to build up the inflationary expectations in the system, thereby causing the velocity of money to increase, which would not be easily reversible. These would be the direct effects of expansionary money supply. Hence borrowing from the Central Bank for financing deficits should be discouraged.",

However, the price pressures due to excessive monetary expansion will not be reflected in the realised inflation rates as long as the country's foreign exchange balances are sufficient to meet additional demand. The continuous depletion of external assets would however exert pressure on the exchange rate, which would eventually lead to a sharper depreciation. The resulting increase in",
