HER EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT AND MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING, ETHNIC AFFAIRS

AND NATIONAL INTEGRATION MINISTRY OF FINANCE, PLANNING, ETHNIC AFFAIRS

AND NATIONAL INTEGRATION COLOMBO

Your Excellency,

Section 35 of the Monetary Law Act (Chapter 422) requires the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to submit an Annual Report to your Excellency on the state of the economy, the condition of the Central Bank and a review of the policies and measures adopted by the Monetary Board, within four months after the end of each financial year. The forty sixth Annual Report of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, in respect of the Year 1995, is submitted herewith in fulfilment of this obligation.

While this Report was being prepared, the Central Bank suffered a dastardly attack on its premises, which caused extensive damage. Forty one of our employees made the supreme sacrifice of their lives and hundreds suffered serious injuries while on duty. Undaunted by this cowardly act of terror inflicted on innocent people, the Bank's employees rallied round bravely to restore normalcy to the financial system in a few days. We salute our fallen comrades, to whose memory this Report is dedicated. We honour those who laboured day and night to thwart the objective of the terrorists to destabilise the functioning of the financial system.

Yours sincerely,

A.S. JAYAWARDENA Governor

Central Bank of Sri Lanka at temporary premises, 58, Sri Jayawardenepura Mawatha, Kotte, Rajagiriya

30 April 1996.
