Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

ACCOUNTS AND OPERATIONS OF THE CENTRAL BANK

ACCOUNTS AND BANKING OPERATIONS

Total assets/liabilities of the Central Bank as at end

1995, stood at Rs.173,505 million, registering an increase of

11.3 per cent over the previous year. The Balance Sheet of the

Central Bank as at 31 December 1995 together with the Profit

and Loss Account of the Bank for the year ended 31

December 1995 are presented in Table II-l.

On the assets side, the international reserves of the Bank

rose by 10.9 per cent from Rs.95,282 million to Rs.105,647

million. The international reserve has remained the largest

asset category accounting for 60.9 per cent of the total assets

compared to 61.1 per cent at end 1994. Domestic assets

increased by 25.8 per cent, from Rs.31,755 million to

Rs.39,950 million.

Among domestic assets, loans and advances to the

Government and Government and Government guaranteed

securities rose by 5.9 per cent and 145.6 per cent,

respectively. Medium and long-term credit facilities to

commercial banks and other credit institutions declined by

16.8 per cent due to net repayments and provisions on account

of non-performing loans. Short-term advances to commercial

banks also declined by 15.1 per cent in 1995.

On the liabilities side, currency in circulation increased

by 8.4 per cent from Rs.43,081 million to Rs.46,685 million.

A comparison of the major components of assets and

liabilities of the Bank is given in Table II—2. The total

deposits comprising mainly the commercial bank deposits

maintained with the Central Bank under Statutory Reserve

Requirements against their deposit liabilities and the deposits

made by international organisations, foreign governments and

foreign banking institutions registered an increase of 20.2 per

cent from Rs.61,023 million to Rs.73,320 million. Deposits

constituted the largest category of liabilities and accounted for

42.3 per cent of total liabilities. Within this category, deposits

of commercial banks increased by 28.3 per cent, mainly

owing to the increase in rupee deposit liabilities of the

commercial banks. Deposits of international organisations,

foreign governments and foreign banking institutions rose by

13.3 percent.

The total gross income of the Bank for the year 1995 was

Rs.22,502 million compared with Rs.25,680 million in 1994,

while the total gross expenditure in 1995 was Rs.20,802

million compared with Rs.24,280 million during the previous

year. Around 85.4 per cent of the income of the Bank was

generated from investment of foreign reserves while the

interest earned from domestic transactions accounted for

about 7.4 per cent. After making allowances for expenditure

and allocations to reserves and provisions for depreciation and

other charges, the balance net profit of the Bank, amounting

to Rs. 1,700 million, was earmarked to be paid to the

Consolidated Fund of the Government in terms of Section

39 (c) of the Monetary Law Act (MLA).

Income Recognition

Interest and other income are recognised in the books on

an accrual basis except interest on non-performing loans

which is recognised on a cash basis.

Discounts and Premia on Central Bank Securities

Discounts allowed and premia received on Central Bank

Securities issued during the year are accounted for in the

Profit and Loss Account for the year, irrespective of the date

of maturity of these securities.

Net Profit

The net profit disclosed in the Profit and Loss Account is

after charging all expenses and making the following

provisions:

(/') Provision for non-performing loans

(if) Provision for depreciation of fixed assets

(ii'i) Other necessary provisions and allocations to

reserves in terms of Section 38 of the MLA.

Bank Rate

The Central Bank rate of interest (Bank Rate) on short-

term advances to commercial banks stipulated under Section

87 of the MLA remained unchanged at 17 per cent per annum.

Short Term Credit

Refinance facilities provided to the commercial banks

under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme

(NCRCS) and the Export Credit Refinance Scheme (ECRS)

were terminated from April and May 1994, respectively.

However, banks which provided the roll over facility to

farmer borrowers prior to the termination of the NCRCS were

granted a refinance facility on the roll over amount. The

outstanding amount under this facility as at end 1995

amounted to Rs.61.3 million, as compared with Rs.72.2

million in 1994.

Medium and Long Term Credit

The Medium and Long Term Credit Fund (MLCF)

remained unchanged at Rs.4,925 million during 1995. The

( I V )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

Accommodation to Finance Companies

The Central Bank continued to grant financial

accommodation to finance companies in terms of Section

20(4)(o) and 21(1) of the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of

1988. The total amount disbursed under this facility in 1995

amounted to Rs.172 million and the total amount outstanding

was Rs.2,472 million at end 1995.

Reserve Requirements

The Statutory Reserve Requirement on commercial

banks remained unchanged throughout the year. The Statutory

Reserve Requirement on rupee deposits remained at 15 per

cent, on foreign currency deposits invested outside Sri Lanka

at 5 per cent and, on all other foreign currency deposits at 15

per cent, throughout the year.

Open Market Operations

Secondary Treasury Bill Market

The sales of Treasury bills in the Secondary Market

decreased from Rs.21.2 billion in 1994 to Rs.17.0 billion in

1995. The purchases increased from Rs.18.9 billion to Rs.35.3

billion during the same period. The decline in sales was

mainly attributed to the shifting of short-term investments

from the Secondary Market to the Repurchase Market for

Treasury bills as well as the sales of Central Bank Securities.

The yield rates applicable on investments in three month

Treasury bills in the Secondary Market varied between 12.99

and 19.66 per cent per annum during the year.

Repurchase Market for Treasury Bills

The Central Bank continued the sale of Treasury bills under Repurchase Agreements (Repos) during the year. Under this scheme, the total value of Treasury bills sold in 1995 amounted to Rs.l97.6 billion. The overnight Repo yield rate, which was 19 per cent at the beginning of the year, gradually declined to 12 per cent by end March. However, with gradual tightening of rupee liquidity towards the end of the year, the overnight Repo yield rate rose to 16.5 per cent at end 1995.

Reverse Repurchase Agreements

With a view to mitigating the erratic fluctuations in the

call money rates, a Reverse Repurchase Facility (RRF) was

introduced from 10 November 1995 to inject liquidity into the

market in times of severe liquidity shortage. The facility was

operated by calling for quotations from commercial banks

who were primary dealers in Treasury bills, for a fixed

quantum of Treasury bills, with the quantum decided by the

Open Market Operations Committee (OMOC) of the Bank.

During November and December, the Central Bank had

offered a total amount of Rs.l 1.0 billion under the RRF and

accepted bids for Rs.7.6 billion. However, the RRF was not

effective enough to mitigate the high volatility of call market

rates in late 1995, owing to speculative transactions in the

market and structural factors. The Weighted Average Yield

Rate (WAYR) of the accepted bids during this period

fluctuated heavily, reflecting very high volatility in the money

market. During the latter part of December, the WAYR

increased substantially, reaching 50 per cent on 22 December

1995. The tightness of the market was mainly due to heavy

borrowings by the merchant banks and long-term lending

institutions and a reduction of the amount supplied by the two

state banks as a result of delays in settlement of payments by

the Government.

Subsidy and Ex-gratia Payment to Indian Repatriates

The Bank continued to operate the payment schemes

relating to the repatriation of estate workers of Indian origin

covered under the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of 1964. Total

subsidy payments under this scheme amounted to Rs.323,232

in 1995 compared to Rs.l 12,786 in 1994. Ex-gratia payments

amounted to Rs.39,600 in 1995, compared to Rs.32,175 in

1994.

Import Duty Rebate to Exporters

The Bank continued to reimburse claims made by

commercial banks in respect of import duty rebates paid to

exporters on behalf of the Government. A total sum of Rs.923

million was reimbursed in 1995, compared with Rs.840

million in 1994.

Foreign Exchange Operations

The Central Bank continued to engage in foreign exchange operations by way of spot purchases and sales and forward purchases of US dollars against Sri Lanka rupees. It also continued to invest its foreign exchange reserves in international money and capital markets.

The total value of foreign currency purchases by the

Central Bank from commercial banks in Sri Lanka amounted

to Rs.l9,187 million, while foreign currency sales to

commercial banks amounted to Rs.436 million in 1995. This

compared with purchases of Rs.31,452 million and sales of

Rs.615 million during 1994.

Sale of Gold and Silver

The Central Bank continued its gold and silver sales at

the Head Office. The value of gold sales amounted to Rs.9.6

million in 1995, compared to Rs.l2.1 million in 1994, while

the total sale of silver amounted to Rs.0.4 million in 1995

compared to Rs.0.2 million in 1994.

Asian Clearing Union

The total value of transactions routed through the Asian

Clearing Union (ACU) in 1995 amounted to Rs.39,030

million compared with Rs.37,195 million during the previous

year. The rupee value of the net settlement made in foreign

currency in 1995 amounted to Rs.l8,028 million compared

with Rs.l3,834 million in 1994. The Board of Directors of the

ACU with the concurrence of the relevant member authorities

has approved a new procedure which includes, inter alia, the

settlement of transactions among member countries in US

dollars, from January 1996.

Compulsory Savings Fund

During the year, the Bank paid out Rs.0.06 million

(inclusive of interest) on applications made by 4 contributors.

Government Accounts

The number of operational accounts at end 1995 was 164 compared to 178 at end 1994.

Foreign Finance

During the year under review, the Bank continued to receive disbursements made available under various foreign loans and grants, while effecting repayments of foreign loans on behalf of the Government.

CURRENCY ISSUE

The Central Bank, as the sole currency issuing authority,

continued to perform the function of issuing legal tender in

Sri Lanka during 1995. The currency in circulation increased

from Rs.43,081 million at end 1994 to Rs.46,685 million at

end 1995. Notes in circulation accounted for 96 per cent of

the currency in circulation.

The Clean Currency Notes Programme to improve the

standard of the currency notes in circulation continued to

function in 1995. The process of withdrawing unfit notes in

circulation and replacing them with new notes continued

throughout the year. The currency verification, counting and

sorting system (CVCS), which has two reader sorter machines

commissioned in 1992, operated throughout 1995 to speed up

the Clean Currency Notes Programme. In 1995, the Currency

Department received two machines to process old and new

designs of Sri Lanka currency notes.

In July 1995, the Central Bank issued a Rs.2 standard

circulation coin to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the

Food and Agriculture Organisation. Further, arrangements

were made to issue another Rs.5 commemorative coin in 1996

to mark the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations

Organisation.

The mobile currency exhibition introduced in 1992

continued during 1995. Sri Lanka coins and notes and

specimen currency notes of many countries were displayed at

the mobile exhibition.

BANKING DEVELOPMENT

The principal functions of the Banking Development

Department include policy formulation relating to banking,

the implementation of the Banking Act in relation to the

establishment of commercial banks, branches of commercial

banks and the establishment of specialised banks and the

evaluation of proposals for the introduction of financial

instruments. Further, the Department monitors the

performance of Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs)

and attends to policy formulation for the RRDBs. The

Department also co-ordinates the work of. the Regional

Offices of the Central Bank and monitors their performance.

A notable feature in the development of commercial

banks during 1995 was the opening of two new domestic

commercial banks and a branch of a foreign bank. The

establishment of two domestic private commercial banks, the

Union Bank of Colombo Ltd. and Pan Asia Bank, took place

after seven years, i.e. since the establishment of Seylan Bank

Ltd. in 1988. The establishment of the Colombo branch of the

Korea Exchange Bank took place after a lapse of three years

since the establishment of the last foreign bank, namely a

branch of the Public Bank Berhad in Colombo in 1992. The

establishment of new commercial banks reflects the country's

economic growth and confidence in its future economic

growth and the rising share of the financial sector in the GDP

( V I )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

as well as the potential for further growth of the banking

sector.

With the establishment of these commercial banks, the number of banking institutions including development banks and savings banks increased from 44 in 1994 to 47 in 1995. At the end of 1995, the banking system thus comprised 26 commercial banks (8 domestic commercial banks and 18 foreign commercial banks), 17 RRDBs, three development banks and a savings bank.

Branch Expansion

During 1995, the bank branch network expanded by 4 per cent to 1,199 with the approval of the Monetary Board. Details of the expansion are as follows:

The Bank of Ceylon (BOC) opened two new branches at Ahungalla and Athurugiriya in 1995. The Agrarian Services Centres (ASCs) at Galenbindunuwewa, Horowpathana, Ipalogama, Medawachchiya, Thirappane, Yatawatta, Padavi-Parakramapura, Megalawa and Dodangoda were upgraded to ' C grade status. New extension offices were opened at the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) and the

Board of Investment (BOI) offices in Colombo. The extension office at the Export Trade Centre at Transworks House was closed down. Further, the BOC opened 2 new overseas branches in Madras and Karachi.

The People's Bank (PB) opened a branch at Dehiwela during 1995. The PB opened 4 new service counters at the Colombo International Air Port (Arrivals area), the Army Head Quarters (Galle Face), Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (Jawatte) and the Law Society Building (Hulftsdorp Street). Eight new pawning centres were also opened during the year at Bogawanthalawa, Embuldeniya, Kotuwegoda, Kahatuduwa, Gothatuwa, Thalawathugoda, Polpitigama and Anuradhapura.

The Hatton National Bank Ltd. (HNB) opened seven new branches at Batticaloa, Panchikawatte, Ampara, Mt. Lavinia, Maharagama, Pinnawala and Suriyawewa in 1995. Further, a pay office at Nawaloka Hospital was opened during the year. Seylan Bank Ltd.

two new branches at Aluthgama and Kaduwela. The branch

position of Sampath Bank also increased with the opening of

new branches at Anuradhapura, Kuliyapitiya and Avissawella.

Two new branches were added to the branch network of

RRDBs during 1995 at Mirigama (Gampaha RRDB) and

Nawalapitiya (Kandy RRDB).

During the year, the National Savings Bank (NSB)

established six new branches at Tissamaharama, Kaduwela,

Veyangoda, Elpitiya, Katubedda and Divulapitiya.

Mobile Banking Centres

The RRDBs, the two state banks and private commercial

banks continued to provide mobile banking services in order

to cater to the needs of people living in areas where there

were no banking facilities or where the banking facilities were

inadequate.

Installation of Automated Teller Machines

During 1995, commercial banks continued to expand

their Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) network further. The

BOC installed 4 ATMs at its branches in Matara, Galle, Galle

Bazaar and Anuradhapura and one at its extension office at

the DFCC premises. The PB established 2 ATMs at its Head

Quarters branch and Piliyandala branch. The HNB offered

ATM services at its Maharagama branch and the Majestic

City shopping complex, Colombo. The CBCL installed 5

ATMs at its branches in Aluthgama, Kaduwela, Pettah,

Kurunegala and Mutwal. The Sampath Bank Ltd.

commissioned ATM services at its branches in Anuradhapura,

Avissawella and Kuliyapitiya. The Seylan Bank Ltd. installed

4 ATMs at its branches in Mt. Lavinia, Kandy, Kiribathgoda

and Gampaha. During this year, ANZ Grindlays Bank

commenced Automated Teller services to its customers at its

branches in Colombo Fort, Kollupitiya, Kirillapone and

Kandy.

BANK SUPERVISION

The regulatory and supervisory function of the Central

Bank is executed by the Department of Bank Supervision

through a process of continuous supervision and periodic

examination of all commercial banks in the country. The basic

objective of such supervision is to ensure the safety and

soundness of the banking system with a view to safeguarding

depositors' interests and promoting public confidence in the

system.

The method by which these responsibilities are carried

out is through on-site examinations and off-site surveillance.

Where on-site examinations are concerned, the Examiners of

the Department visit the banks concerned and through a

process of appraisal of a bank's assets, its performance,

management, capital adequacy, liquidity, systems and

controls evaluate its financial condition. Ensuring compliance

with regulatory requirements is also an integral part of the

examination process. During the year under review, the

Department commenced such examinations in respect of 11

commercial banks and one RRDB. Of these, examinations of

the RRDB and seven commercial banks were completed

during the year under review. The examination of seven

commercial banks which had commenced in 1994 was also

concluded in 1995.

Under the off-site surveillance system, the Department

continued to monitor the financial condition of commercial

banks and RRDBs on the basis of monthly statements of

Assets and Liabilities forwarded to the Department.

Monitoring the operations of the Foreign Currency Banking

Units established under the Foreign Currency Banking

Scheme too, was carried out on a monthly basis. Information

on irregular and large advances was also obtained on a

quarterly basis to ascertain the trend in the quality and the

volume of the advances portfolio of commercial banks. The

profitability and financial strength of each commercial bank

in relation to its own peer group and to the whole industry

were computed and evaluated on the basis of monthly

statements of assets and liabilities and annual statements of

income and expenditure furnished by the banks.

The Department continued to fulfil its responsibility in

ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements under

the Banking Act and the guidelines issued by the Central

Bank on prudential requirements. These included the

maintenance of a minimum level of liquid assets, capital

based on risk-weighted assets, the adherence to the single

borrower limits, restrictions on accommodation to directors

and their interests, the submission of annual financial

statements in the prescribed accounting format within the

statutory period, setting up interest in suspense on non-

performing advances, and providing adequate provisions for

bad and doubtful debts. During the year under review, the

level of liquid assets maintained by a majority of commercial

banks ranged between 20 per cent (minimum) and 30 per cent

of total specified liabilities. They also maintained the capital

adequacy standards enforced by the Central Bank which are

based on the norms specified by the Banking Regulations and

Supervisory Practices Committee (BASLE Committee).

These standards comprise a two-tier system in terms of which

the commercial banks are required to maintain a core capital

(paid up capital plus free reserves) and an overall capital of

not less than 4 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, of total

risk weighted assets.

The Department continued to administer the Deposit

Insurance Scheme which has been in operation since 1987.

The number of institutions registered under the scheme is 8

while the premium payable continued to be 3.75 cents for

every Rs.l00 per quarter.

Amendments to the Banking Act

The amendments to the Banking Act which were

necessitated by the reforms effected in Sri Lanka's financial

sector were passed with the Banking Amendment Act No.33

of 1995 by Parliament in November 1995. These amendments

contained provisions which have the effect of levelling the

playing field for all licensed commercial banks and

broadening the scope of the Central Bank's supervision and

regulatory framework. The significant changes brought about

in terms of these amendments are as follows:

- Repealed the provisions which enabled licensed

commercial banks to maintain Numbered Accounts.

However, accounts already opened would be operative

for a period of 2 years from the appointed date with no

credits allowed except for the purpose of interest.

- Enabled the Monetary Board, if it considers necessary,

to have a measure of control over the off-shore banking

units operated by licensed commercial banks by

extending the provisions of the Monetary Law Act as

well as the Banking Act to Foreign Currency Banking

Units.

- Established the procedure for licensing, controlling and

regulating the activities of specialised banking

institutions such as development banks and savings

banks whose operations have not been subject to such

regulations in the original Banking Act. The amended

Act details the type of activities that these specialised

banks can undertake.

- Enabled the Central Bank to require licensed

commercial banks to make adequate provisions for bad

and doubtful debts.

- Limited the investments in shares and in immovable properties by licensed commercial banks to ensure that they do not divert their funds away from the principal business of banking.

- Enabled the Monetary Board to permit a licensed

commercial bank to have as its subsidiary a company

which carries on any form of business which is not

inconsistent with the business of banking.

A requirement was also made that the alteration of the

Memorandum and Articles of Association of licensed

commercial banks should be made only with the prior

approval of the Monetary Board. Further, the minimum level

of capital requirement for commercial banks was increased to

Rs. 100 million.

The amendments also introduced a new part, viz. Part IXA to the Banking Act, which contained provisions for licensing and supervision of specialised banks, which include development banks and savings banks. The National Development Bank, the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon, the National Savings Bank and the State Mortgage and Investment Bank were specifically designated as specialised banks. The provisions of Part IXA provide that from an appointed date, the business of accepting deposits of money and investing and lending such money could be carried out only by companies which have an equity capital of not less than Rs.50 million and which have the authority of a license issued by the Monetary Board. The institutions so licensed have been categorised as licensed specialised banks. Some institutions such as finance companies and co-operative societies have been exempted from the requirement of obtaining a licence in terms of Part IXA of the Banking Act. The Act specifies the procedure for obtaining a licence and enables the Monetary Board to issue directions regarding the form and manner in which the business of licensed specialised banks should be carried out.

The Department's attention was also focused on the role and responsibilities of external auditors conducting the statutory audit of licensed commercial banks. Guidelines to external auditors requiring them to perform certain specific tasks in addition to their normal audit are being prepared, and will be issued in due course.

NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka through the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions (DSNBFI) continued to monitor and supervise the activities of finance companies. The DSNBFI placed greater emphasis on on-site examination of finance companies, while also continuing with the off-site surveillance through an Early Warning System (EWS) during 1995.

Based on the consolidated balance sheets of 24 registered finance companies, deposit liabilities in the.financial year ending 31 March 1995 grew by 21.6 per cent following 18.5 per cent growth in the 1993/94 financial year. The capital funds of the companies increased by 21.8 per cent after a 47.5 per cent increase in the previous year. The provision made for bad and doubtful debts by the finance companies increased by 21.7 per cent during the 1994/95 financial year as compared with a 171.5 per cent increase in the previous financial year. The significant increase in provisioning for bad and doubtful debts in the financial year 1993/94 was mainly a result of the implementation of the "Finance Companies (Provision for Bad and Doubtful Debts) Direction No.2" which was issued by the Monetary Board in 1991.

The total assets of finance companies increased by 21

per cent to reach Rs.l2,359 million as at 31 March 1995. The

total liquid assets had risen by 18.6 per cent, while advances increased by 21.2 per cent during the 1994/95 financial year. Investments of finance companies which stood at Rs.991.3 million as at 31 March 1994 increased to Rs. 1,026.2 million as at 31 March 1995.

The relief scheme to depositors of failed finance companies which became operational in 1989, continued during the year. The relief payments made to depositors of seven failed finance companies during the year amounted to Rs.l 1.9 million, while the total relief payments made to depositors upto end 1995 amounted to Rs.523.5 million. One registered finance company, the administration and management of which were taken over by the Monetary Board in February 1992, was granted loans amounting to Rs.171.5 million during the year to meet the liabilities of depositors. As at end December 1995, the total outstanding Central Bank loans which have been granted to this company, stood at Rs.1,417.6 million.

The Department was also involved in formulating several amendments to the Finance Companies Act No.78 of

1988, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Finance and Banking and the experience gathered by the Central Bank in implementing the provisions of the Finance Companies Act No.78 of 1988.

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE

The responsibilities of the Development Finance Department (DFD) in 1995 continued to be the operation of the Credit Guarantee Schemes for Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMI), the Bus Purchase Loan (BPL), the Entrepreneur Development Programme (EDP) and the refinance scheme for low income housing under the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Housing Guarantee Low Income Shelter Programme (HGLISP) - Phase IV. The administration of the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund (MLCF) was limited mainly to following up on the performance of projects (excluding refinance provided to finance companies) which had been refinanced prior to the suspension of the MLCF facility in December 1991.

Credit Guarantee Operations

A summary of credit guarantee operations under the credit guarantee schemes administered by the Central Bank as at 31 December 1995 is given in Tables II-6 and II-7 covering Small Scale Industries (SSI) Scheme, SMI-I, II, III and IV Schemes and BPL Scheme, respectively. Table II—8 shows an industry-wise classification of projects financed under the SMI-II, III and IV Schemes.

Small Scale Industries Scheme

A total of 767 loans were guaranteed under this scheme. At end 1995, only eight loans amounting to Rs.0.4 million

( X )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

and involving a total guarantee commitment of Rs.0.3 million

were still in operation. Claims under this scheme amounting

to Rs.1.7 million have been met by the Treasury. The liability

in respect of the eight loans outstanding under this scheme is

Rs.0.3 million.

Small and Medium Scale Industries Scheme I

The SMI-I scheme was in operation from 1979 to 1981. During the period of its operation, 1,670 loans were guaranteed. The total guarantee liability in respect of these loans was Rs.286 million. At the end of 1995 only 40 loans involving a guarantee liability of Rs.4.6 million were outstanding.

Premia collected under this scheme and post claim

recoveries by the Central Bank amounted to Rs.12.2 million

and Rs.19.9 million, respectively. Available resources made

up of premia payments and post claim recoveries amounting

to Rs.32.7 million were sufficient to meet liabilities under the

scheme. This is mainly due to the close follow-up of post

claim recoveries conducted by the Department.

Small and Medium Scale Industries Scheme II

The SMI-II Scheme came into effect in 1982 and

continued in operation until 1989. During this period 2,531

guarantees involving a maximum guarantee liability of

Rs.714 million were issued. At end 1995, 1,564 loans

amounting to Rs.702 million were fully repaid, while 353

guarantees to the value of Rs.l68 million were either

withdrawn or had been cancelled due to non-compliance by

the Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) with the Central

Bank's operating instructions. A total of 226 claims with a

liability of Rs.59 million was received as at end 1995 of

which 125 claims amounting to Rs.30 million were fully

settled. Interim payments not exceeding 50 per cent of the

liability of the Central Bank amounting to Rs.0.7 million

were made in respect of 4 claims from the Northern and

Eastern Provinces in terms of a decision taken in that regard,

while 45 claims amounting to Rs.12 million were rejected on

account of non-compliance by the PCIs with relevant

operating instructions. Loans relating to 5 claims were repaid

by the borrowers after submission of claims to the Central

Bank, while PCIs have withdrawn 7 claims amounting to

Rs.3.6 million. At the end of 1995, consideration of 26 claims

amounting to Rs.8.2 million had been deferred on account of

rescheduling, following rehabilitation programmes

undertaken by the PCIs or recommencement of repayment of

the loans.

At end 1995, 440 loans amounting to Rs.l 11 million with a total guarantee liability of Rs.66 million were operational. Of these, 326 loans with a liability of Rs.86.7 million were reported to be in arrears.

Premia collected under this scheme amounted to Rs.29.4

million as at end 1995, while post-claim recoveries by the

Central Bank amounted to Rs.29.7 million, making a total

inflow of Rs.59.1 million.

Small and Medium Scale Industries Scheme III

The SMI-III Scheme was in operation from 1988 to

1991. Under this scheme, guarantees were issued against

3,130 loans amounting to Rs. 1,956 million. At end 1995,

1,339 loans amounting to Rs.607.8 million had been fully

repaid, while guarantees relating to 280 loans and amounting

to Rs.212.6 million had either been withdrawn or had lapsed.

A total of 146 claims with a Central Bank guarantee liability

of Rs.35.5 million were received as at end 1995. Of these, 83

claims totalling Rs.22.9 million were settled, while 41 claims

totalling Rs.12.1 million were rejected. Consideration of 4

claims was deferred due to regularisation of the respective

loan accounts by the borrowers after the submission of such

claims. By end December 1995, 1,387 loans amounting to

Rs.433.7 million with a maximum guarantee liability of

Rs.280.7 million were operational. Of these, 621 loans with a

potential liability of Rs. 143.2 million, were in arrears. The

total premia collected under this scheme as at 31 December

1995 was Rs.42.5 million, while Rs.20.1 million was paid to

the Central Bank as post-claim recoveries.

Small and Medium Scale Industries Scheme IV

The SMI-IV Scheme commenced in March 1992 and is

currently operational. By end 1995, 7,382 loans amounting to

Rs.6,057 million had been guaranteed. The Central Bank's

liability in respect of these loans amounted to Rs.4,176

million. During the year, 542 loans amounting to Rs.264.3

million had been fully settled, while 238 guarantees had been

either withdrawn or had lapsed due to non-compliance with

the Central Bank's operating instructions by the PCIs. At end

1995, 6,553 loans totalling Rs.3,747 million were

operational. Total guarantee liability on these loans amounted

to Rs.2,588 million. At end December 1995, 87 claims

amounting to Rs.53 million were received, of which 26

claims amounting to Rs.7 million were settled. The total

amount collected as guarantee premia at end 1995, was

Rs.84.9 million. By the end of the year, a sum of Rs.6.5

million had been received as post-claim recoveries.

Bus Purchase Loan Scheme

This scheme was inaugurated in November 1990 to assist PCIs to grant loans to private bus operators to purchase buses for public transport. Loans were refinanced by the National Development Bank (NDB) and guaranteed by the Central Bank. The scheme ceased to operate at the end of 1992 as the resources available to the NDB to provide refinance were fully committed by that date. Under the BPL scheme, 1,932

the United States Government under the HGLISP - Phase IV. These funds are made.available to the PCIs designated as Sub Apex Lenders (SALs) /Direct Primary Lenders (DPLs) who have entered into an agreement with the Central Bank under the HGLISP. At present, Bank of Ceylon (BOC), People's Bank (PB), Hatton National Bank Ltd., State Mortgage and Investment Bank, Seylan Bank Ltd., Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd., the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and the RRDBs of Kurunegala, Kandy, Kegalle, Puttalam, Galle, Badulla, Gampaha, Matale and Matara participated as SALs under this scheme. In October 1995, four other RRDBs, namely Hambantota, Kalutara, Ratnapura and Nuwara Eliya signed agreements to participate in this programme. The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) participated in this scheme through the BOC. Loans were granted under this scheme for any purpose related to owner occupied housing, including acquisition of land for house construction, additions/improvements and renovation to existing houses. Households earning a monthly income of Rs.5,700 or less were eligible to obtain loans under this scheme.

The HGLISP operated upto 1994 on the basis of an advance of Rs.l50 million provided by the Treasury. In

October 1994, a borrowing of US dollars 10 million being the first tranche of a loan of US dollars 25 million under the Housing Guarantee Agreement was made. The proceeds of this loan were disbursed by April 1995. In order to continue with the scheme, in June 1995, another advance of Rs.150 million was provided by the Treasury.

A statistical profile of the performance of the HGLISP Phase IV is given in Tables II-9,11-10, II—11 and 11-12.

In 1995, Rs.305 million had been approved under this programme and Rs.277 million disbursed. The cumulative figures from 1992 to 1995 show that Rs.889 million had been approved and Rs.637 million disbursed.

A very high proportion of borrowers under this scheme has been from the rural sector. Thus, 80 per cent of approvals in 1993 and 1994 and 89 per cent of approvals in 1995 were for rural sector housing. The breakdown of borrowers by gender in 1995 showed that an equal percentage of 30 per cent of borrowers in both the rural and urban sectors were female. According to the purpose-wise classification of loans, about 35 per cent of loans in 1995 were for construction of

new houses, 24 per cent for improvements or extensions of

existing houses and 40 per cent for land acquisition. The share

of loans for land acquisition, at 40 per cent, showed a large

increase when compared with 24 per cent in 1994.

In 1995,11 per cent of the loans under this scheme were

for amounts of Rs. 10,000 or less, while over 25 per cent were

for amounts ranging from Rs. 10,000 to Rs.25,000. A further

53 per cent of loans were for amounts from Rs.45,000 to

Rs. 100,000. The proportion of loans approved by the HDFC,

PB and the RRDBs showed a substantial increase over the

previous year, while the share of the NHDA declined.

Nevertheless, the NHDA which grants small loans below

Rs.25,000 accounted for 40 per cent of loans granted under

this scheme, indicating the strong bias of the scheme towards

the very low income groups. A feature of the performance of

this programme in 1995 has been the more even participation

by the financial institutions in this scheme.

The maturity pattern of loans under this scheme

indicated that 46 per cent of loans have been for upto 5 years,

a further 16 per cent for periods from 5 to 10 years and 38

per cent for period from 10 to 15 years.

Investment of SMI and BPL Guarantee Fund Resources

Investment of SMI and BPL Guarantee Fund resources in the Primary Treasury bill market which commenced in July

1988, continued during 1995. Investment holdings of Fund resources and premia collections at end 1995 amounted to Rs.899 million. Interest income from investments during the same period amounted to Rs. 120.5 million.

Entrepreneurship Development Programme

The EDP was continued for the benefit of small industrialists through specially designed training programmes at district level. These programmes have been organised to meet the demand for upgrading technical and management skills of industrialists operating at village level, with a view to developing their products and services and making them more competitive in the market. Funds necessary for this purpose were approved by the World Bank in late 1993 under its Technical Assistance Programme covering the SMI Scheme. During 1995, a training programme was held in Kantalai in

the Trincomalee District for school leavers and unemployed

rural youth, aimed at creating an awareness in

entrepreneurship potential and advising them on matters

relating to dealing with banks and other service sector

institutions. This programme was attended by 90 participants

during its two day session. Officers of the Department also

addressed senior officers of branches of the People's Bank on

aspects relating to the SMI and the credit guarantee scheme at

seminars organised in Hambantota, Dambulla, Kalutara,

Kandy and Habarana.

loan, the Central Bank would function as the Apex Lender and would refinance loans to participating financial

institutions. This programme will be administered by the

DFD.

Follow-up and Inspection of Projects

The programme of inspection of SMI projects was continued in 1995 in order to monitor their viability and operation. A total of 109 projects were inspected with a view to recommending corrective action where necessary and to settling claims lodged by the PCIs. The majority of projects were located in the districts of Colombo, Badulla, Kandy, Matara, Gampaha and Galle.

RURAL CREDIT

During the year under review, the Central Bank continued to function as the Executing Agency for a number of donor-funded projects. As the Executing Agency, the Bank's functions involved the admission of Participating

eligible under projects, monitoring and co-ordination of loan

the loan schemes in collaboration with other local agencies.

The following were the projects implemented by the Bank

during 1995.

(a) ADB Funded Projects

(i) Agriculture Rehabilitation Project;

(ii) Small-Holder Tea Development Project;

(iii) Mid-Country Perennial Crops Development

Project;

(iv) Southern Province Rural Development Project;

(v) North-Western Province Water Resources

Development Project.

(b) IFAD Funded Projects

(vi) Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development

Project.

(c) IFAD/CIDA/GOSL Funded Projects

(vii) The Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project.

The detailed operations of the above Projects during the

year under reference are discussed below.

(i) Agriculture Rehabilitation Project

The Agriculture Rehabilitation Project Credit Scheme

funded by the ADB for providing financial facilities for

rehabilitating persons and property affected by the on-going

civil war in the Northern and Eastern Provinces was closed on

30 June 1995 after its successful completion by the Bank.

The Project covered the eight districts of Jaffna,

Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya in the North,

Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee in the East as well as the

bordering districts of Anuradhapura, Hambantota,

Moneragala, Polonnaruwa and Puttalam. The Project

Management Unit (PMU) which was set up in the Department

in 1991 to implement the credit component had provided

refinance totalling Rs.688 million to banks in respect of

12,896 sub loans granted by the PCIs as at the closing date,

using more than 99 per cent of the total allocation for credit

disbursement. In view of the strong demand for credit from

the affected persons, arrangements were made by the Bank to

recycle the recovered loans. The Bank will continue to

monitor the recovery and re-lending of funds by PCIs through

the PMU.

(ii) Small Holder Tea Development Project

The Small Holder Tea Development Project (SHTDP), also funded by the ADB, commenced operations in 1989. The Project was scheduled to be terminated by the end of 1995, but on a request by the Government, was extended till end-1997. The SHTDP aims at increasing production and export of tea by smallholders, improving the quality of tea and the productivity of privately owned tea factories. The activities financed under the credit scheme encompassed field development, nursery development and factory development including the rehabilitation and the improvement of tea factories. The credit scheme experienced a considerable setback during the early stages of its implementation, largely due to the various bottlenecks encountered at the field level and low world prices that discourage investment in this sector. During the year under reference, the credit awareness campaign started previously was continued by the Central Bank by conducting seminars and other publicity programmes in the project area. In 1995, several revisions were introduced to the original design of the credit scheme, such as an upward revision of the credit limit for field development, a reduction of interest rate by 2 percentage points for field development thus reducing the on-lending rate from 16 per cent to 14 per cent and the relaxation of the eligibility criteria concerning vehicle loans to registered green leaf collectors and private tea factory owners. These measures enabled the PCIs to accelerate the rate of disbursement of loans during the latter half of 1994 and in 1995, reaching the credit targets set by the ADB for 1995. Loan approvals and disbursements by the PCIs for field development and factory rehabilitation increased considerably during the year. The total loans disbursed by the PCIs upto end 1995 stood at Rs.339 million. Of this, disbursements during 1995 amounted to Rs.l93 million. Loans granted for field development (new planting and re-planting) in 1995 amounted to Rs.87 million, while that for nursery and factory development amounted to Rs.8 million and Rs.98 million, respectively. Refinance provided by the Central Bank for all categories in 1995 stood at Rs.92 million.

(iii) Mid-Country Perennial Crops Development Project

The Perennial Crops Development Project Credit

Scheme funded by the ADB completed the seventh year of

operations in 1995. The credit scheme was designed to

provide medium-term credit facilities to farmers at

concessional rates for promoting the production and the

commercialisation of perennial crops, particularly minor

export crops and fruit crops. The Project also lays emphasis

on the promotion of modern technology concerning on-farm

post-harvest handling and processing in the perennial crops

sector in the country. Although the Project was scheduled to

be terminated in December 1995, it was subsequently

extended by the ADB for two more years, taking into account

the improved performance of the Project in 1995.

(XVII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

The reformulation of the credit scheme by way of extending the project area to cover the entire country except Northern and Eastern parts and including new PCIs under the Project has been accompanied by an increase in the disbursement of project funds during the year. The cumulative amounts of the approval and the disbursement of loans by PCIs as at end November 1995 stood at Rs.598.3 million and Rs.394 million, respectively. At end 1995, the cumulative amount of refinance granted by the Central Bank to PCIs against their disbursement of funds amounted to Rs.l83 million.

Strong demand for sub loans from the PCIs has resulted in an inadequacy of loan proceeds to entertain all the loan applications submitted by the borrowers. The ADB has agreed to re-allocate US dollars 1 million from another expenditure head of the Project for the credit component. Further, the Central Bank also obtained the approval of the Treasury to grant an interest subsidy of 5 percentage points to the two state banks to enable them to extend credit out of their own funds at an interest rate of 14 per cent in respect of loan applications held with them subject to a ceiling of Rs.100 million.

The Central Bank made arrangements to train 20 officers from PCIs on monitoring, supervision and implementation of perennial crop loans under a specially designed training programme at the College of Agricultural Banking of the Reserve Bank of India in October 1995. The costs of this training programme were met out of project funds.

(iv) Southern Province Rural Development Project

The Southern Province Rural Development Project funded by the ADB began operations in 1992 with the objective of raising the income and quality of life of people in the Province by providing credit facilities for creating income and employment generating opportunities in the Project area. The Bank functions as the executing agency for the credit component of the Project which has a total credit allocation of SDR 6.4 million (approximately Rs.450 million). The Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) and the three RRDBs at Galle, Matara and Hambantota have been admitted as PCIs which are assisted by a Project Office set up at the Southern Province Provincial Council. Under the Project, refinance is provided by the Bank for financing small/ medium scale industries located at Charley Mount Industrial Estate in Weligama and other small/medium scale rural enterprises in the Southern Province. The Bank lends PCIs at 6 per cent per annum, while the PCIs grant sub-loans at 14 per cent per annum.

The provision of refinance to RRDBs commenced in 1994. During 1995, a sum of Rs.38.1 million in respect of 1,395 loans was granted by the Bank by way of refinance.

The cumulative refinance as at end 1995 amounted to Rs.69.6

million in respect of 3,512 loans.

(v) North-Western Province Water Resources Development Project

This credit scheme funded by the ADB, completed the second year of operations in 1995. Under this Scheme, financial assistance in the form of loans is provided in Kurunegala and Puttalam districts for agro-wells, small scale lift irrigation projects, agricultural activities and self-employment projects. In the case of self-employment activities, the Project provides for a strong emphasis on lending to female borrowers. From the inception of the Project, Puttalam and Kurunegala RRDBs and the Hatton National Bank functioned as PCIs. In order to enhance credit delivery, the People's Bank and the Bank of Ceylon were also admitted as new PCIs in November 1995. The ADB has provided a sum of SDR 1.6 million (Rs.90 million) for the disbursement of credit under the Project. The Government's contribution to the credit scheme takes the form of a subsidy granted to farmers for the construction of agro-wells.

As at end 1995, PCIs had disbursed Rs.6.6 million for the construction of 200 agro-wells and Rs.6.6 million for 550 self-employment sub-projects of women in the North-Westem Province. As from 1 July 1995, the interest rate on sub-loans was reduced from 16 per cent to 14 per cent per annum, while at the same time the on-lending rate of the Central Bank was revised downward from 8 per cent to 6 per cent per annum.

(vi) Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development Project

The Integrated Rural Development Project in the Kegalle District funded by IFAD has a credit component of SDR 1.55 million for disbursing credit to beneficiaries for agriculture and self-employment activities. This Project commenced its operations in October 1987 and was terminated in December 1995. However, to provide refinance facilities to PCIs for loans disbursed prior to the closing date, the accounts of this Project will be kept open until end June 1996. The amount of funds disbursed under all categories of the Project stood at Rs.147 million as at end 1995 exceeding the total allocation of Rs.90 million (SDR 1.55 million). Loans were granted for short-term cultivation as well as medium-term agricultural and industrial purposes. During 1995, a sum of Rs.l9.3 million was disbursed under the Project for banana cultivation, dairy development and self-employment projects. The total number of beneficiaries under the Project stood at 8,471 as at the closing date. The Central Bank will continue to monitor and supervise the loan recovery under the Project.

(vii) The Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project

The Central Bank continued its operations as an

executing agency of the Small Farmers and Landless Credit

(XVIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

(SFLC) Project during 1995 in the four districts of Puttalam, Kandy, Galle and Matara. The Project aims at alleviating poverty and improving the living conditions of the poorest of the poor in the above-mentioned districts. For this purpose, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has provided a loan of SDR 4.8 million and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) a grant of SDR 4.7 million. The contribution of the Central Bank towards the Project on behalf of the Government will amount to SDR 2.9

million. The Project activities which commenced in 1990 completed the sixth year of operations in 1995.

The number of loans, as at end 1995 granted to the beneficiaries in Kandy and Puttalam (IFAD Districts) stood at

19,700, recording a value of Rs.168 million. The comparable figures for Galle and Matara districts (CIDA Districts) were 10,166 loans and Rs.79.5 million, respectively. A satisfactory rate of recovery of 87 per cent and 86 per cent has been achieved in IFAD and CIDA districts, respectively, in respect of loans granted under the Project.

An impact study on the Project beneficiaries was conducted by an independent organisation in mid-1995. The study revealed that about 85 per cent of the beneficiaries of the Project has been selected from the target group and about 66 per cent of the beneficiaries to whom financial assistance had been extended by the Project had crossed the poverty line by mid-1995. It was also revealed by the Study that women constituted 63 per cent of the total beneficiaries of the Project.

REGIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS

The activities of RRDBs continued to expand during 1995, thereby assisting the process of development of the rural economy.

Branch network of RRDBs

The total number of RRDBs in operation remained unchanged at 17 as at end 1995. Two new branches were added during the year increasing the total number of RRDB branches to 171 in 1995 (Table 11-13).

Deposit Mobilisation

The RRDBs have contributed significantly to mobilising rural savings by the introduction of attractive savings schemes and the provision of mobile banking services to unbanked and under banked areas. The total deposits mobilised by RRDBs at the end September 1995 stood at Rs.l,760 million in respect of 902,996 accounts, indicating an increase of 17 per cent in the value of deposits and 8 per cent in the number of accounts when compared with the position at end 1994. Savings deposits accounted for the bulk of these deposits. The total value of savings deposits amounted to Rs.l,439 million in respect of 894,659 accounts. The average amount in a savings account increased marginally from Rs.l,534 in 1994 to Rs. 1,608 in 1995. The average value of a fixed deposit rose from Rs.30,370 in 1994 to Rs.39,541 in 1995.

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

Delivery of Credit

During the period January to September, 1995 RRDBs

disbursed Rs.l,481 million in respect of 258,547 loans

including advances granted against the pledge of gold and

gold articles. During 1994, loans granted by RRDBs

amounted to Rs.l,808 million in respect of 327,187 loans.

The average size of a loan (including advances granted

against the pledge of gold and gold articles) has risen

gradually from Rs.5,526 in 1994 to Rs.5,728 in 1995.

Among the loan schemes introduced by RRDBs during

1995 were schemes for persons who had obtained

employment abroad and for teachers. The first of these loan

schemes was introduced by RRDBs in collaboration with the

Foreign Employment Bureau of Sri Lanka in order to assist

persons selected for employment in South Korea by providing

loans prior to their departure abroad. The RRDBs also

concentrated on the recovery of loans during the year.

Other Activities

The RRDBs provided a range of ancillary services to

their customers and performed a developmental role in the

rural economy. The RRDBs rendered advisory assistance by

co-ordinating beneficiary training programmes to their

customers. They continued to hold Janahamuwa meetings in

villages so that the rural poor would be made aware of

banking facilities available at RRDBs and also as a means of

extending credit facilities. The RRDBs also continued to

promote marketing and processing of agricultural products.

The RRDBs continued to act as participating credit

institutions in several special credit schemes, namely, the

Small Holder Tea Development Project, Perennial Crop

Development Project, Agricultural Rehabilitation Project,

USAID Housing Guarantee Low Income Shelter Project,

Southern Province Rural Development Project, North­

western Province Water Resources Development Project,

Small and Medium Scale Industry Loan Project and the Isuru

Project.

RURAL BANKING AND STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

During 1995, the College has catered to many training

needs of the Central Bank, commercial banks, other financial

institutions and non-banking organisations.

In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the training of field officers and beneficiaries of institutional credit. These programmes have laid emphasis on development, and are geared to national economic needs, particularly in areas such as poverty alleviation and rehabilitation.

Considering the number of requests received, training

courses for the ensuing year have been designed embodying

varied course contents particularly with new methodology,

keeping pace with the progress made in the banking and

economic sectors. Of these, 32 courses are exclusively for

Central Bank officers in areas of training identified by various

departments. The use of popular computer software packages

at preliminary and advanced stages provide another set of

training programmes for Central Bank officers. There are 19

programmes for the RRDBs on projects useful and suited to

their localities. Keeping other sectors in mind, training

courses, seminars and workshops have been designed on

topical subjects on popular fields of study.

Total Quality Management for the service sector

organisations, Effective Resource Allocation, Structural

Adjustment Process, and the Evolving Global Market

Economies are some of the new programmes scheduled for

1996.

An APRACA-CENTRAB International Course on

Management Development for South Asian countries was

successfully conducted by the College in July 1995 at which

there were 30 participants. It is envisaged that a few more

similar programmes will be conducted during the following

year.

The Self Access Centre for English Language for Central

Bank officers has been operational since April 1994. It is

envisaged that new programmes will be introduced in the

future.

A Research and Development Division has been set up

to assess the training needs of the banking and other financial

sectors. This unit will be responsible for the improvement of

the quality of the programmes, and for the introduction of

new programmes in keeping with the emerging economic

activities of the country and to engage in research studies in

the area of training, and post training performance for both

government and private sector. An Entrepreneurial Advisory

Unit has also been set up to provide advice and guidance to

small scale entrepreneurs.

EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND

In terms of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) Act,

the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is

charged with the responsibility of receiving contributions,

surcharges and income from the investment of the monies of

the Fund, maintaining proper accounts of registered

employers and the individual members of the Fund and also

effecting refunds of benefits to its members. These activities

were carried out in close co-operation with the Employees'

Provident Fund Division of the Department of Labour which

( X X )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

attends to the administration and enforcement of the

provisions of the EPF Act.

Contributions

According to provisional data, the contributions received

by the Fund during the year 1995 amounted to Rs.8.2 billion,

as against Rs.7.4 billion in 1994. This represents an increase

of 11 per cent over the level of contributions received during

the previous year.

Members' Balances

Members' balances as at 31 December 1995 before

allocation of interest for the year under review have been

estimated to stand at Rs.81.5 billion which is an increase of

Rs.5.8 billion or 8 per cent over that of 1994.

Investment

During the year under review, the Fund invested an

estimated sum of Rs.45 billion in Government Securities,

Treasury bills, Inter Bank Call Money Market and

Government guaranteed debentures. This is an increase of

Rs.7 billion over the level of investments in 1994. The total

investments held by the Fund as at 31 December 1995 have

been estimated at Rs.100 billion, which is an increase of

Rs.19 billion over the level of 1994.

Income Received from Investments

In terms of an amendment to the Inland Revenue Act in

1989, the exemption from income tax granted to the EPF was

withdrawn. Accordingly, all income earned on investments

with effect from 1 April 1989 are subject to a Withholding

Tax of 10 per cent. The total Withholding Tax deducted from

the investment income for the year 1995 and the arrears paid

during the year amounted to Rs.l.8 billion.

In 1995, the estimated income received from investments amounted to Rs. 14 billion, as against Rs. 11 billion in 1994.

Refunds

The total sum paid out by way of refund of EPF benefits

to members during the year 1995, amounted to Rs.2.7 billion,

as against Rs.2.6 billion in 1994. This records an increase of 4

per cent. During the year under review 52,258 claims for

refund of benefits were paid out, as against 49,986 claims

disposed of in 1994.

EPF Housing Loan Scheme

The EPF Act was amended by Act No.42 of 1988 to

enable members to obtain loans of upto 75 per cent of the

balance standing to their credit from certain lending

institutions for housing purposes. The participating lending

institutions in this scheme are the Housing Development

Finance Corporation, National Housing Development

Authority, State Mortgage and Investment Bank, People's

Bank, Bank of Ceylon, National Savings Bank and the

Co-operative Rural Banks.

As of 31 December 1995, the EPF Department processed and dispatched a total of 59,880 applications for certification of balances to the respective Labour Officers.

EXCHANGE CONTROL

Consequent to the acceptance of Article VIII Status of the IMF on 15 March 1994 by Sri Lanka, the activities of the Department of Exchange Control during 1995 have been mainly confined to grant of approvals for applications relating to capital account transactions and monitoring of large current international transactions, especially the release of exchange of over US dollars 20,000 or its equivalent.

Investments Abroad by Resident Companies

During 1995, several Sri Lankan companies were

permitted investments to establish joint venture companies

abroad to market their products in the countries where these

companies were established as well as in neighbouring

countries. Investments were permitted in management

companies to construct hotels in the Maldives and Singapore.

Some construction firms were also granted permission to

enter into contracts with foreign construction companies and

to obtain sub-contracts abroad.

Foreign Currency Loans

Applications for foreign currency loans for purchase of

local inputs in value added form for executing export orders

continued to be approved on a case by case basis.

PUBLIC DEBT

In terms of Section 113 of the Monetary Law Act

(MLA), the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) through its

Public Debt Department (PDD) continued to manage the

public debt on behalf of the Government. The main debt

instruments used by the PDD were Government Securities

(GSs) Rupee Loans, Treasury bills (T-bills) and Treasury

Certificates of Deposits (TCDs). In fulfilling its

responsibilities the PDD continued to engage in the issuance

and servicing of domestic debt, the servicing of foreign debt

of the Government of Sri Lanka, the issuance of Central Bank

Securities (CBSs) and State Mortgage and Investment Bank

(SMIB) debentures. The PDD took pioneering steps in 1995

to develop the debt securities market through the Primary

Dealer System (PDS).

(XXI)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

Policy Measures

During the year under review, the PDD introduced a

number of measures to improve the market for government

debt instruments. A review of the performance of the PDS,

which came into being in July 1992 and was formalised in

November 1994, was carried out for the first time in June

1995. The PDD conducted weekly meetings with Primary

Dealers with a view to maintaining continuous dialogue on

current developments in the money market, especially the

debt securities market. Two seminars/workshops were

organised by the PDD during 1995 in collaboration with the

Financial Market Development Project of the USAID for

investors and Primary Dealers on fixed income securities. The

Primary Dealers were encouraged to use computer based

systems for their trading and settlement activities and for

reporting information to the CBSL. The PDD developed a

computer software package in-house and issued it to the

Primary Dealers for reporting information on diskettes to the

PDD on their market activities. A data base was established in

the PDD on secondary market activities using the information

thus obtained from the Primary Dealers. During 1995, the

PDD used this data base for dealer surveillance and analytical

work relating to secondary market activities of the Primary

Dealers. On the basis of this information the PDD

commenced the release of a periodical report to the Primary

Dealers on their activities in both the primary and secondary

markets.

The PDD initiated amendments to the MLA, the

Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance (RSSO) and

Local Treasury Bills Ordinance (LTBO) with a view to

developing the Government and Central Bank Securities

Market. During 1995, the amendments were passed by the

Parliament, which included, among others, the provision

relating to opening of current account facilities with the

CBSL by non-bank Primary Dealers, the issue of Treasury

Bonds, a new medium and long-term instrument, either in

certificate or scripless form, on auction basis to public

through the Primary Dealers and the issue of Treasury bills in

scripless form.

Operational Activities

The total outstanding gross government debt as at end 1995 was Rs.616,382 million. When compared with the position as at end of 1994, this indicated an increase of Rs.77,817 million. The outstanding external debt liabilities as at end of 1995 amounted to Rs.344,475 million, indicating an increase of Rs.42,512 million over that as at end of 1994, of which Rs.28,676 million was on account of exchange rates movements. Of the total outstanding government debt, foreign debt accounted for 55.9 per cent, while the balance 44.1 per cent represented domestic debt. Table 11-14 indicates the composition of gross public debt.

Treasury Bills

During 1995, Treasury bills formed a major instrument

of domestic borrowing of the Government. The total Treasury

bills outstanding as at end of 1995 was Rs.l 13,771 million

compared with Rs.98,896 million in the previous year,

showing an increase of Rs. 14,875 million, the result of new

issues amounting to Rs. 16,475 million and retirements

amounting to Rs. 1,600 million during the year under review.

The authorised limit of Treasury bills remained unchanged at

Rs.125,000 million during 1995. With effect, from the first

week of May 1995, the following measures were

implemented by the CBSL in order to improve primary

auctions of Treasury bills and CBSs:

(a) Phasing out of non-competitive bidding by Public

Sector Institutional Investors within a time frame of

one year effective May 1995.

(b) Fixing and prior announcement of T-bills to be

issued under each maturity to the public at primary

auctions.

During 1995, the Annual Review of the Primary Dealers

was conducted by the PDD as at June 1995 in accordance

with Section 6.1 of the Statement of Responsibilities and

Privileges for Primary Dealers issued in November 1994. On

the basis of the findings of this review, the CBSL revoked the

licences of two Primary Dealers and appointed two new

Primary Dealers thus maintaining the total number of Primary

Dealers unchanged at 22, consisting of 16 commercial banks

and 6 others.

As a part of monetary management strategy, the

Monetary Operation Unit (MOU) which is serviced by the

Public Debt, Banking and Economic Research Departments

continued to make decisions on a weekly basis with regard to

auctions of Treasury bills, such as the distribution of the

amount to be offered to the market, the maturity structure for

the CBSL purchases, the offers to the public prior to the

auction.

(XXII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

Access to weekly primary auctions was confined to the

Primary Dealers and other institutions authorised by the

CBSL. Major buyers in the primary market were mostly

commercial bank Primary Dealers and a few non-bank

Primary Dealers. It was observed that certain Primary Dealers

were active in the secondary market. The CBSL secondary

window was open only to the commercial banks.

The bank Primary Dealers, purchasing for their own

portfolios and on behalf of others, were the major buyers of

Treasury bills in the Primary Market. Other major buyers

were public sector institutional investors such as the NSB,

approved provident funds and other statutory funds.

On the basis of primary issues, total value of Treasury

bills held by the CBSL increased from Rs.8,979 million or

9.1 per cent to Rs. 14,984 million or 13 per cent at end 1995.

The non-CBSL holdings increased from Rs.89,917 million to

Rs.98,786 million. However, the share of the latter

represented a decline from 90.9 per cent of the total holdings

in 1994 to 86.9 per cent of the total holdings in 1995. The

stock of Treasury bills held by the Primary Dealers consisted

of purchases at both primary auctions and the secondary

window of the CBSL and purchases from other sources

including non-Primary Dealer commercial banks,

development and other banks, provident/pension funds and

other approved funds, insurance companies, finance

companies, other institutions and individuals.

Of the Treasury bills outstanding as at end of 1995, 66.6

per cent was of 12 month maturity. The remaining 33.4 per

cent constituted maturities of three months (17.1 per cent), six

months (3.8 per cent), and other maturities (12.5 per cent).

The weighted average yield rates for 3,6 and 12 month Treasury bills fluctuated between 13.24-19.91, 13.14-20.07 and 13.68-20.54 per cent, respectively, during the year. The annualised weighted average yield rates for the last 5 years are given in Table 11-15 below. The total interest commitment on account of Treasury bill issues during 1995 amounted to Rs.18,221 million.

Rupee Loans

Ten Government Rupee loans were floated and

subscriptions of Rs.46,715 million were received during 1995.

Major subscribers were the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF)

and the National Savings Bank (NSB). All these loans carried

an interest rate of 14 per cent per annum. The first three loans

had an optional maturity of 5-6 years and remaining seven

loans had a maturity of 5-7 years. Fourteen Rupee loans

consisting of Rs.26,350 million were repaid during 1995. As a

result, net subscription to Rupee loans amounted to Rs.20,365

million resulting in an outstanding debt of Rs.157,928 million

as at end of the year 1995. This included Rs.24,088 million of

long-term bonds issued by the Government in 1993 in

connection with the restructuring of two state banks. The

Department continued an advertising campaign to attract new

investors to long-term government securities.

Treasury Certificates of Deposits

The CBSL continued to issue TCDs which commenced

during 1990. As in the past, the TCDs were issued for

maturity periods of 6 and 12 months at yield rates of 17.15

per cent and 18.06 per cent, respectively. The face value of

sales made during the year under review amounted to Rs.191

million of which Rs.65 million was sold by the NSB and

Rs.l26 million was sold by the Currency Department of the

CBSL. The corresponding repayments made by these two

sources amounted to Rs.66 million and Rs.70 million

respectively totalling Rs.l36 million. These repayments

included Rs.21 million of interest payments. The amount of

TCDs outstanding as at end of 1995 was Rs.200.3 million.

amounted to Rs.l89,601 million and Rs. 144,636 million

respectively, while the borrowing from commercial banks

stood at Rs.l0,239 million. Of the bilateral creditors, the

Government of Japan as the largest lender accounted for

Rs. 101,098 million or 53.3 per cent of the total bilateral

borrowings. The International Development Association

(IDA) was the largest multilateral creditor and accounted for

Rs.79,190 million or 54.8 per cent of the total multilateral

debt.

During 1995, the PDD issued Rs.2,820 million worth of

CBSs with 3 months maturity in 14 issues in order to absorb

(XXIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

excess liquidity in the market. There was no outstanding stock of CBSs at the end of 1995 as compared with that of Rs.3,740 million as at end of 1994. Of the 14 issues of CBSs during 1995, 12 issues carried a coupon rate of 13.0 per cent per annum while the last two issues during August and September, 1995 carried a coupon rate of 15.5 per cent per annum.

debentures amounting to Rs.500 million were issued at

14.5 per cent per annum and a maturity of 5 to 7 years. The

entirety of these debentures were purchased by the NSB.

REGIONAL OFFICES - MATARA, ANURADHAPURA AND MATALE

During 1995, the Regional Offices of the Central Bank at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale continued to carry out their development activities in addition to carrying out the traditional central banking functions assigned to them. Currency operations, cheque clearing activities, data collection, conducting beneficiary training programmes, inspection of the activities of the RRDBs, assisting in regional development projects and co-ordination with government departments, agencies and organisations involved in development work in their respective regions were among the main activities of the Regional Offices.

The Matara Regional Office handled the activities relating to the implementation of the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project, the Southern Province Rural Development Project, the Small Holder Tea Development Project and the Inland Bill Scheme. The Regional Office conducted seminars on these credit schemes and assisted in supervision and credit recovery under these projects. The Regional Office assisted other development programmes implemented by government departments, commercial banks and other agencies in the region by organising a number of seminars, training programmes and workshops as well as educational programmes for school children. The Regional Office continued to follow up loans granted under the All Island Self Employment Credit Scheme and reported a recovery rate of 83 per cent in respect of these loans. The Regional Office also carried out the inspection of RRDBs during the year.

The Anuradhapura Regional Office, with the assistance of several government departments and institutions, conducted 85 training programmes attended by 4,106 participants during the year to provide training required for the efficient execution of projects as well as for potential entrepreneurs. The Regional Office carried out a Survey of

Industries in the Anuradhapura district. The Regional Office also co-ordinated work in connection with the Village Development Project sponsored by the Central Bank at Negampaha and was associated with two dairy development projects at Thirappana and Kekirawa. The Village Development Project has been undertaken with a view to assisting in the economic development of the area by improving technical skills and thereby improving productivity and strengthening village level organisations. The Regional Office conducted educational programmes for Advanced Level students in the districts of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala, also undertook the inspection of RRDB branches in the area.

The Matale Regional Office placed special emphasis on training of loan beneficiaries and bankers. Training programmes on a variety of subjects including dairy development, storage of big onions, the batik industry and potato cultivation were conducted during the year. Eight seminars were also conducted on topics relevant to Advanced Level students. Altogether, 1,288 persons attended these programmes. During 1995, the Matale Regional Office received loan proposals from small scale producers for projects including dairy development, farm machinery and small industries. The Regional Office prepared 97 project feasibility reports in order to assist these producers. The reports were forwarded to the financial institutions in the area for necessary action. The Regional Office also assisted applicants for loans to purchase 3 wheel taxis in obtaining finance from banks. The Regional Office helped the Matale Self-Employees' Association to conduct three exhibitions and sales. The Office continued its activities relating to other projects such as the Small Holder Tea Development Project Credit Scheme and the Perennial Crop Development Credit Scheme. The office also carried out the inspection of RRDBs in the area.

The Regional Offices also provided regional cheque

clearing facilities to the commercial banks in the area.

INFORMATION AND PUBLICATIONS

The Central Bank's role as a collector and disseminator

of information was carried out largely by the Information

Department. The Library continued to add to its collection of

books, pamphlets and periodicals covering socio-economic

developments domestically and worldwide. It was able to

provide a rich source of both published and unpublished

material to researchers, bankers, teachers, students and others

interested in developments in socio-economic developments.

The following Central Bank publications were released

through the Information Department:

1. Annual Report 1994 (Sinhala, Tamil and English)

published in Sinhala and the News Survey published in

English were much sought after by GCE (Advanced Level)

students and teachers. The educational programmes organised

by the Information Department too continued to attract a large

number of GCE (Advanced Level) students and teachers.

Audio visual media, press releases and book exhibitions

were also utilised by the Department in disseminating

information. The Video Unit of the Department produced

documentaries and also filmed important events taking place

in the Central Bank. The Art Work Visuals Section continued

to design brochures, posters and cover pages for Central Bank

publications.

The Printing Press completed 380 printing assignments

during the year accounting for over 90 per cent of the Bank's

printing needs.

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

The Economic Research Department continued to be responsible for collecting and analysing economic and financial statistics and conducting economic research for the guidance of the Governor and the Monetary Board in policy formulation, and for providing information to the public. The Department was also responsible for the publication of the

Annual Report, Monthly Bulletin, Economic Survey of the

First Half of 1995 and Economic Bulletin as well as provision

of weekly financial statistics to the public through

newspapers. Also, the Department prepared the usual

"September 15th Report" required by the Finance Ministry to

be used in the preparation of the Budget.

In addition, the Department attended to the preparation

of the weekly note on international commodity prices,

monthly trade statistics on imports and exports, weekly and

monthly reports on tea and rubber auctions in international

markets, monthly commodity review and reports giving

observations and recommendations on various economic

issues for the information of the Monetary Board, as well as at

the request of ministries and other institutions and

organisations. Half yearly and annual surveys on industrial

production were conducted during the year. The Department

continued to provide data to the International Monetary Fund

(IMF) on a regular basis. The Department co-ordinated the

Government's consultations with the two IMF missions in

March and December, 1995. Furthermore, provision of data to

other international organisations and coordination of

relationships with such institutions were continued as usual.

The Department conducted the IMF Regional Course on

"Financial Programming and Policies" in Colombo in May

1995, in collaboration with the IMF.

The officers of the Department served on internal

committees regarding policy matters, such as the Monetary

Operations Unit, the Treasury bills Tender Committee,

Balance of Payments Committee and Exchange Rate

Committee.

SURVEYS AND DATA COLLECTION

The Statistics Department continued to perform the

function of collection and dissemination of socio-economic

data. The conduct of sample surveys, and the collection and

compilation of data in the subject areas of Prices and Wages,

National Accounts, Employment and Imports were continued

during the year.

Consumer Finance Survey 1996/97

The preliminary work in connection with the Consumer

Finance Survey scheduled to be conducted in 1996 and 1997

was completed during the year. This is the seventh survey in

the series.

The main objective of the proposed survey is to collect comprehensive data on socio-economic conditions of the household sector in the country. The information to be collected under this survey will provide the basis for evaluating changes in the socio-economic conditions of the population. The survey will also be a major source of

( X X V )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

information on demographic characteristics, employment and

unemployment, nutrition, income distribution, housing and

education.

Country Wide Data Collection Scheme

The Country Wide Data Collection Scheme which was launched in 1978 continued to operate in 1995, thereby completing its seventeenth year of operation. Under this scheme, information on retail prices of consumer items and agricultural inputs, producer prices of a wide range of items and daily wage rates for activities in paddy, tea, rubber and coconut cultivation in the informal sector and in the small scale construction sector continued to be collected from selected centres spread throughout the country on a regular basis. The scope of the scheme was extended during the year to collect additional information on production trends and underlying reasons for the fluctuations in producer prices with a view to using the scheme as an early warning system. The data collected under this scheme were published in the annual publication 'Prices and Wages Statistics'.

National Accounts

The activities in connection with the estimation of National Accounts continued. The Statistics Department was involved in data collection from both primary and secondary sources. Data were collected more frequently for the compilation of quarterly estimates of National Accounts. Preliminary work was undertaken to institute a revision of the estimation procedures, to move to a national income accounts series with a more current base year. The revision of estimates based on the guidelines in the revised System of National Accounts published by the United National Statistical Office in 1993 was in progress in 1995.

Monitoring of Imports

The Department continued to monitor imports through data collected from commercial banks on Letters of Credit (LCs) for the purpose of forecasting imports.

Employment Statistics

The survey of public sector employment continued in 1995 with the objective of ascertaining the trends in employment in government departments, ministries, provincial councils, local authorities and in the corporation sector. In the absence of estimates of employment in the private sector, information was collected from administrative records of the Employees' Provident Fund and other Provident Funds and from institutions registered under Chamber of Commerce, with the objective of ascertaining major developments and trends in employment in the organised private sector.

Publications

The Department continued to publish the two annual

publications titled 'Sri Lanka Socio-Economic Data' and

'Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka' which provide

comprehensive information on key Socio-Economic variables.

DATA PROCESSING

The creation of a modernised information technology

environment within the Bank was taken a step further during

the year with the acquisition of 100 new personal computers

(PC) for the use of various departments. Plans were made

during the year to lay the framework for a networking

arrangement in the Bank to link up the stand alone machines

into a distributed system. These arrangements were to

constitute a significant departure from the existing outdated

centralised system built around the Data Processing

Department over the past three decades.

The Department undertook the development of user

friendly software appropriate for the planned distributed

system. An information retrieval system to provide fast access

to bibliographic information was developed for the library and

progress was satisfactory in capturing library catalogue data

into the computer data bases. A PC-based personal

information system as well as a system to process employee

leave and attendance was developed and installed in all

departments to be used in administration work.

Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House

During the year under review the Sri Lanka Automated

Clearing House (SLACH) installed new machinery capable of

handling 150,000 - 300,000 cheques per day. The replacement

was necessary because the old machinery designed to handle

cheque volumes of 40,000 - 50,000 per day were required to

cope with per day average cheque volumes exceeding

100,000. The increased workload at SLACH resulted in

frequent breakdown of machinery thereby disrupting cheque

clearance, inconveniencing banks and customers and leading

to staff unrest. The new systems became operational in June

1995.

The upgrade of the SLACH in Colombo will be followed

by the removal of old equipment from its present site and

their reinstallation at a site in Kandy which would serve as the

backup facility in an emergency and also as a low volume

regional clearing site. This work is expected to be completed

in 1996.

The SLACH expanded the scope of its off-line inter­bank payment system to include the Direct Debit System (DDS). Under the DDS the customer can authorise billing companies such as Ceylon Electricity Board, Sri Lanka Telecom and Insurance Companies to collect monthly dues by permitting the bank to debit the account with the amount of money due to the billing company for settlement of the bill. This procedure will eliminate considerable paper work and

(XXVI)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

correspondence which must take place under existing

arrangements monthly or at frequent intervals and reduce

collection costs to the billing company, while at the same time

helping to improve customer convenience. This facility will

enhance the fund transfer system in the banking system

through increased speed and accuracy.

The success of the DDS will depend greatly on the

interest taken by billing organisations and the manner in

which they market this system, in persuading the customers to

join the system by offering incentives so that the customers

would see the benefit of joining the DDS.

TRAINING

Training of officers in academic and non academic fields

continued in 1995. Academic training was related to Post­

graduate studies in Economics and allied fields at recognised

universities. Officers were enrolled for Masters and Ph.D.

degrees. During the year, eight officers proceeded abroad to

follow Masters Degree courses and one officer to follow a

Ph.D. Degree course. Nine officers were granted study leave

to follow post-graduate courses in Sri Lanka. These

comprised post-graduate diploma courses in Business and

Finance, Administration, the Diploma Course on Journalism

and the Mass Media and the Diploma in Banking and

Management.

Non-academic training comprising short-term courses,

seminars and workshops, both local and foreign, was related

to specific fields relevant to the Bank. During 1995, a total of

76 officers proceeded abroad on short-term training. A total of

263 officers participated in training courses and seminars held

at local institutions, while 583 officers participated in courses

conducted by the Rural Banking and Staff Training College.

The Department continued its other functions of holding promotional examinations for certain categories of employees and scholarship examinations for the Staff Class. The Efficiency Bar Examination for the Staff Class was held in December 1995.

MANAGEMENT AUDIT

During 1995, the Management Audit Department, in

accordance with its programme of work, carried out the audit

of various departments in the Bank. In the course of these

audits, emphasis was laid on system audits and highlighting

shortcomings in internal controls.

Apart from the normal audit functions, the Department undertook several special studies and surveys entrusted to it by the Bank management. These studies included the following:

(a) Review of cadre for Bank's drivers,

(b) Review of the cadre for minor employees in grades

PREMISES

During 1995, the Premises Department engaged in the

following construction projects, in addition to its routine

maintenance work and upkeep of the Central Bank Premises.

Extension to the Head Office

The construction work of the extension to the Head

Office building, which commenced in August 1994,

continued during 1995. The extension building is expected to

be completed before the end of 1997. With the completion of

this building, the Bank would be able to accommodate all its

departments which are now housed in rented buildings.

New Two-Storeyed Building at Rajagiriya

This building with a total floor area of approximately

7,725 sq.ft. which was being constructed to provide alternate

accommodation for resident participants of training

programmes conducted at Rural Banking and Staff Training

College was in the final stages of completion.

Pilgrim Rest at Kataragama

Preliminary work in connection with the construction of

the proposed 20 room Pilgrim Rest at Kataragama was carried

out in 1995.

WELFARE

As in the past, in 1995, the Central Bank provided

several welfare facilities to the Bank employees through the

Welfare Department. These include concessional loan

schemes such as Housing, Staff Benefit, Vehicle and

Provident Fund loan schemes; reimbursement of medical

expenses subject to approved ceilings; a regular in-house

(XXVII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

clinical service; a subsidised canteen service and a 75 per cent

payment for the procurement of railway and bus season

tickets. Some of these welfare facilities were enhanced in

1995.

The Central Bank canteen, continued to provide

subsidised meals and tea to the employees. The canteen also

provided catering services to official functions when

necessary.

The staff of the Bank Medical Clinic included a doctor

and a team of experienced clinical staff. For the convenience

of those employees seeking treatment, essential diagnostic

tests were conducted at the clinic's laboratory. The clinic also

maintained a stock of essential drugs which were sold to the

employees at cost.

SECURITY

During 1995, the Security Services Department's main

function was to provide security to the main building, the

Bank's building at Rajagiriya and departments housed at the

Cargo Boat Development Co. Ltd., Ceylinco and Sharlima

Buildings. In addition, the security network covered the

Regional Offices at Anuradhapura, Matara and Matale, as

well as the stores at Kelaniya and Layards Broadway,

Kataragama Circuit Bungalow, Nuwara Eliya Holiday Resort,

the Kandy site and the new Bank building site. Security

coverage was also given for the residence of the Governor.

The task of providing personal security to the Governor and

foreign delegates visiting the Central Bank was also a

responsibility of the Department.

The Department provided escorts for currency and gold

transport with the assistance of the Police.

The Department assisted the Rural Banking and Staff

Training College to conduct several training programmes on

security and the Fire Preventive Training Course conducted

by the Colombo Fire Brigade during the year with a view to

enhancing the efficiency of the security personnel attached to

the Department.
