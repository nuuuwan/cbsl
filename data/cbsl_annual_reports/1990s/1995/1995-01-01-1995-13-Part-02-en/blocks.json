The National Development Bank, the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon, the National Savings Bank and the State Mortgage and Investment Bank were specifically designated as specialised banks. The provisions of Part IXA provide that from an appointed date, the business of accepting deposits of money and investing and lending such money could be carried out only by companies which have an equity capital of not less than Rs.50 million and which have the authority of a license issued by the Monetary Board. The institutions so licensed have been categorised as licensed specialised banks. Some institutions such as finance companies and co-operative societies have been exempted from the requirement of obtaining a licence in terms of Part IXA of the Banking Act. The Act specifies the procedure for obtaining a licence and enables the Monetary Board to issue directions regarding the form and manner in which the business of licensed specialised banks should be carried out.",

    "text": "The Small Holder Tea Development Project (SHTDP), also funded by the ADB, commenced operations in 1989. The Project was scheduled to be terminated by the end of 1995, but on a request by the Government, was extended till end-1997. The SHTDP aims at increasing production and export of tea by smallholders, improving the quality of tea and the productivity of privately owned tea factories. The activities financed under the credit scheme encompassed field development, nursery development and factory development including the rehabilitation and the improvement of tea factories. The credit scheme experienced a considerable setback during the early stages of its implementation, largely due to the various bottlenecks encountered at the field level and low world prices that discourage investment in this sector. During the year under reference, the credit awareness campaign started previously was continued by the Central Bank by conducting seminars and other publicity programmes in the project area. In 1995, several revisions were introduced to the original design of the credit scheme, such as an upward revision of the credit limit for field development, a reduction of interest rate by 2 percentage points for field development thus reducing the on-lending rate from 16 per cent to 14 per cent and the relaxation of the eligibility criteria concerning vehicle loans to registered green leaf collectors and private tea factory owners. These measures enabled the PCIs to accelerate the rate of disbursement of loans during the latter half of 1994 and in 1995, reaching the credit targets set by the ADB for 1995. Loan approvals and disbursements by the PCIs for field development and factory rehabilitation increased considerably during the year. The total loans disbursed by the PCIs upto end 1995 stood at Rs.339 million. Of this, disbursements during 1995 amounted to Rs.l93 million. Loans granted for field development (new planting and re-planting) in 1995 amounted to Rs.87 million, while that for nursery and factory development amounted to Rs.8 million and Rs.98 million, respectively. Refinance provided by the Central Bank for all categories in 1995 stood at Rs.92 million.",
