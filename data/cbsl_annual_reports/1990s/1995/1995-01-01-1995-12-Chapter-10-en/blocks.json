Despite high and rising interest rates, the demand for credit by the private sector remained high owing to a drying up of capital inflows from abroad, a reduction in funds obtainable through a depressed share market and liquidity problems faced by business enterprises as a result of lower than usual turnover, towards the end of the year. Thus, credit to the private sector rose by Rs.42,937 million (29.5 per cent) in 1995 compared with an increase of Rs.21,943 miilion (17.7 per cent) in 1994. This expansion was fuelled by increased bank borrowings by the Government towards end 1995 due to a widening fiscal deficit on account of enhanced expenses on defence and subsidies. The Government contributed to this credit expansion by borrowing Rs.7,067 million in 1995, as against Rs. 1,154 million in the previous year.",

However, as lending to the private sector was more attractive to commercial banks, their credit to the Government declined marginally by end 1995. Consequently, net credit to the Government from the Central Bank rose by Rs.7,662 million, if not for which interest rates in the market would have risen higher.",

This reflected higher borrowings by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) following the damage to its oil storage facilities (Rs. 1,297 million) and the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) owing to escalating world wheat prices (Rs.644 million). Total bank credit to co-operative institutions increased by Rs. 1,398 million in 1995 as against Rs.638 million in 1994, primarily due to an increase in credit to the Paddy Marketing Board for purchases during a record crop year (Rs. 1,458 million) .",

From the source side, the expansion of net credit to the Government contributed to the growth in reserve money. This was reflected in an increase in currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits. Almost sixty per cent of the growth in reserve money occurred in December, reflecting increased availability of Central Bank funds to the Government for settlement of large payments during the month. The money multiplier remained stable at around 2.9. Following the trend observed in the past few years, the income velocity of money continued to decline reflecting reduced inflationary expectations and the increased attractiveness of the banking sector.",

Reduced inflows from abroad, the inability to raise funds in a sluggish stock market, inflationary expectations and cash flow problems of the corporate sector all contributed to a heightened demand for bank credit from the private sector. These factors led to an increase in Treasury bill yields from 14.34 per cent in March to 18.68 per cent in December. Meanwhile, call money rates rose from 18 - 25 per cent in March to 20 - 58 per cent by end December. Also, reflecting speculative behaviour, the money market displayed",

In keeping with the current policies to minimise refinance, the overall outstanding refinance under both short-term facilities and the MLCF, net of provisions for loan losses, was reduced from Rs.3,376 million at end 1994 to Rs.2,800 million at end 1995.",

During the last quarter, a reduction in the supply of funds to the call money market by the two state banks due to delays in settlement of obligations by the Government, an increased demand for funds by non-commercial bank participants and greater reliance on call market funds by other financial institutions including merchant banks exerted pressure on interest rates. Under the impetus of these factors, despite the injection of funds by the Central Bank through its activities in the primary and secondary markets for Treasury bills and reverse repo transactions, call money market rates fluctuated between 16.00 - 102 per cent in December. The reverse repo scheme was not effective enough in containing call money market rates when pressures for funds originated from institutions which were not eligible to be covered by the scheme. In addition, structural-weaknesses in the financial system constrained the effective use of the reverse repo scheme to stabilise short-term interest rates at reasonably low levels. However, in mid-December, market liquidity improved to some extent after a special issue of Treasury bills and the receipt of privatisation proceeds on account of the sale of Colombo Gas Company which enabled the Government to settle part of its obligations to the state banks. At end December, call money rates were in a range of 20.00 - 58.00 per cent. The continued presence of non-commercial bank financial institutions as major borrowers and seasonally high transaction demand for credit during the festive season in December kept the interest rates from falling.",

Accordingly, the discount rate and the repo rate had been raised to 19.01 per cent and 16.50 per cent by end December 1995. Meanwhile, the rediscount rate was maintained at a relatively low level (20.47 per cent) in December to provide liquidity to the market at a reasonable rate.

    "text": "The bank branch network also continued to increase during the year with a consequent expansion in banking services. An important development in bank branch expansion in 1995 was the opening of branches in India and Pakistan by Bank of Ceylon, facilitating Sri Lanka's transactions with these two countries. Domestic commercial banks opened 24 branches in 1995 (of which six were opened by the two state banks) as compared to 27 new branches operated in the preceding year. The total number of branches opened by foreign commercial banks increased to 37 with the opening of a branch by the Korea Exchange Bank Ltd. Therefore, the total number of commercial bank branches rose to 901 by end 1995, from 876 at end 1994. With the increase in the branch network of the National Savings Bank (NSB) by six and RRDB branches by two, the total number of bank branches rose to 1,168. Accordingly, banking density, as measured by the total number of bank branches for each 10,000 population, increased from 0.6349 in 1994 to 0.6403 in 1995.",

Unlike the schemes funded by the Central Bank's own refinance, these foreign funded schemes were not considered to interfere unduly with the Bank's monetary policy stance. In the case of ADB funded loan schemes, the lending rate and the Central Bank's refinance rate were reduced by 2 percentage points to 14 per cent and 6 per cent per annum, respectively. This downward revision in the interest rates was required to eliminate the disparity created by the reduction of lending rates by the two state banks for agriculture, exports and industry in late 1994 in an effort to promote growth and employment in the economy.",

In practice, however, many farmers tend to repay their loans in a much shorter period than 270 days and the draw-down on the interest subsidy funds was less than originally anticipated. The total value of the interest subsidy paid to banks in 1995 on account of cultivation loans disbursed during Yala 1994 amounted to Rs.14 million. The Government agreed to extend the relief scheme announced in 1994 to defaulting farmers until Yala 1997. The extension of the relief scheme would help more farmers to have their defaulted loans written-off by banks on payment of 25 per cent of the principal. Further, this would make them eligible to obtain fresh loans as borrowers in good standing. The Government's relief package required the Central Bank to relax its credit guarantee rules, necessitating the waiver of the condition requiring institution of legal action by PCIs to qualify to receive the full amount of the credit guarantee. In terms of this waiver, the Bank underwrites 50 per cent of the principal amount in loss remaining after the payment of 25 per cent by farmers. The general credit guarantee rules will continue to apply to new loans granted under the NCRCS. Representing a further relaxation of general conditions governing the credit guarantee scheme, the Bank made an advance payment of 25 per cent of the estimated total liability on defaulted loans to help RRDBs adversely affected by the Relief Package. Total advance payments to RRDBs upto end 1995 amounted to Rs.60 million.",

In 1995, the total extent of paddy land insured by the AIB under its schemes stood at 71,000 hectares, while that by CICL amounted to 349 hectares. The AIB collected premia amounting to Rs.40 million as against indemnity payments of Rs.25 million. CICL, which collected premia amounting to Rs.0.25 million, made indemnity payments of Rs.0.12 million. A salient feature in crop insurance schemes has been the continuous increase in the area insured and the indemnity payments. The introduction of private crop insurance, though on a negligible scale, could be viewed as a salutary development, since the AIB is unable to cater to the entire crop insurance needs of the country in view of its limited resources. However, legal constraints stand in the way of private insurers penetrating the market on an appreciable scale, since the AIB Act provides a virtual monopoly on crop insurance to the AIB.

Fourteen primary issues were opened to the public for subscription in 1995, all these being initial public offerings (IPO). Six of these were plantation companies being offered for sale by the Government as a part of its ongoing privatisation programme. In comparison, 21 new issues were opened for subscription in 1994. In addition, the Government also offered for sale, on an 'all or nothing! basis, blocks of 51 per cent of the shares in three other plantation management companies. These were taken up by the present managing companies. Of the 14 new primary issues, 13 were undersubscribed. Underwriters to these issues had to take up over 80 per cent",
