Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

10. FINANCIAL SECTOR

10.1 Money supply

Monetary expansion continued to remain high primarily

owing to a significant acceleration of bank credit to the

private sector. This took place in the context of a sharp

drying up of foreign capital inflows which depressed the

domestic capital market. The Government and public

corporations resorted to increased bank credit. As a result,

the money supply measured in terms of Broad Money (M 2)

expanded by 19.2 per cent in 1995. This was a high rate of

monetary growth considered in the context of 19.7 per cent

in 1994 and higher growth during the previous years.

However, it is significant that Narrow Money supply (M,)

grew only by 6.7 per cent in 1995, compared with 18.7 per

cent in the previous year. The faster growth in M 2 than in

Mj was a result of a shift of public preference for interest

bearing assets at a time of high interest rates. New financial

instruments and services such as teller card facilities, the

growing popularity of credit cards and the intensification of

deposit mobilisation efforts by commercial banks helped the

process. Also contributing was a slow growth of new

deposits in the National Savings Bank due to a delay in

responding to rising interest rates, and a shift of investments

by the public from a depressed stock market to the banking

sector.

Net domestic assets of the banking system increased

sharply by 27 per cent as the banks accommodated increased

credit demand by both the private sector and the public

sector through economising on reserves, aggressive banking

practices to mobilise new deposits in a more competitive banking environment and reducing foreign held balances. Despite high and rising interest rates, the demand for credit by the private sector remained high owing to a drying up of capital inflows from abroad, a reduction in funds obtainable through a depressed share market and liquidity problems faced by business enterprises as a result of lower than usual turnover, towards the end of the year. Thus, credit to the private sector rose by Rs.42,937 million (29.5 per cent) in 1995 compared with an increase of Rs.21,943 miilion (17.7 per cent) in 1994. This expansion was fuelled by increased bank borrowings by the Government towards end 1995 due to a widening fiscal deficit on account of enhanced expenses on defence and subsidies. The Government contributed to this credit expansion by borrowing Rs.7,067 million in 1995, as against Rs. 1,154 million in the previous year.

Almost the entirety of growth in credit to the Government from the banking system took place during the second half of 1995 as there was no serious imbalance in the government cashflow during early 1995. The adverse monetary implications of escalating defence and welfare expenditure were seen during the second half of the year when there were heavy claims on domestic financial resources by the Government. However, as lending to the private sector was more attractive to commercial banks, their credit to the Government declined marginally by end 1995. Consequently, net credit to the Government from the Central Bank rose by Rs.7,662 million, if not for which interest rates in the market would have risen higher.

Bank credit to public corporations increased notably by Rs.3,364 million (65.2 per cent) in 1995, in contrast to a sharp decline during the previous two years. This reflected higher borrowings by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) following the damage to its oil storage facilities (Rs. 1,297 million) and the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) owing to escalating world wheat prices (Rs.644 million). Total bank credit to co-operative institutions increased by Rs. 1,398 million in 1995 as against Rs.638 million in 1994, primarily due to an increase in credit to the Paddy Marketing Board for purchases during a record crop year (Rs. 1,458 million) .

Unlike during the last five years, where a major

expansionary impact was brought about by large overall

surpluses in the balance of payments, net foreign assets

(NFA) of the banking system reflected only a marginal

increase of 3.2 per cent in 1995. As there was an overall

deficit in the balance of payments in 1995, this increase was

entirely the result of the depreciation of the exchange rate. Net foreign assets of the Central Bank increased by Rs.8,437 million (12.8 per cent) in 1995, following an increase of Rs. 12,884 million or 24.3 per cent in 1994, whereas those of commercial banks fell by Rs.6,372 million, which was reflected in an accumulation of external liabilities in the form of non-resident foreign currency deposits without a corresponding increase in foreign assets.

Gross foreign assets of commercial banks fell by

Rs. 1,902 million, reflecting a reduction in deposits with FCBUs and balances with banks abroad as the banks shifted their portfolio from less attractive foreign assets to more attractive domestic assets due to a widening of the interest rate differential between foreign currency deposits and domestic financial assets. Meanwhile, gross foreign liabilities of commercial banks rose by Rs.4,470 million (14.5 per cent)

mainly due to an increase in NRFC, RFC and RNNFC deposits.

Reserve money (high powered money or the monetary base) increased by Rs.10,532 million or 15.5 per cent in 1995 as compared with Rs.11,587 million or 20.5 per cent in 1994. From the source side, the expansion of net credit to the Government contributed to the growth in reserve money. This was reflected in an increase in currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits. Almost sixty per cent of the growth in reserve money occurred in December, reflecting increased availability of Central Bank funds to the Government for settlement of large payments during the month. The money multiplier remained stable at around 2.9. Following the trend observed in the past few years, the income velocity of money continued to decline reflecting reduced inflationary expectations and the increased attractiveness of the banking sector.

117

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

10.2 Monetary Policy

The environment in which the Central Bank was called

upon to conduct monetary policy in 1995 differed

significantly from the environment that prevailed in the past

five years. During the last five years monetary growth was

fuelled mainly by a sharp expansion in net foreign assets

arising from large capital inflows. However, this impact was

absent in 1995. The growth in money was thus essentially

caused by a rise in credit to the private sector and the

Government. The challenge faced by the Central Bank in

formulating monetary policy in 1995 was, therefore, to

contain credit growth, thus avoiding the ill-effects of an

unacceptably high rate of money growth, while ensuring that

the system had sufficient liquidity to avoid stifling economic

activity. Thus, the tight monetary policy adopted to

counteract the expansionary impact of capital inflows in the

previous years had to be continued during 1995. The high

Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) of 15 per cent was

maintained throughout the year. However, towards the latter

part of the year, the Central Bank relaxed its tight monetary

policy somewhat by purchasing of Treasury bills and

permitting limited foreign borrowing by financial institutions

to ensure that productive economic activities were not unduly

suppressed by liquidity tightness and very high interest rates.

The Bank continued to rely on open market operations

as the main instrument in conducting monetary policy, using

both its portfolio of Treasury bills and its own securities. As

a result of the mopping up of excess liquidity in the system,

the Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank fell from

Rs.5,093 million at end of 1994 to Rs.2,991 million at end

March 1995. In the second and third quarters, the Central

Bank issued its own 3-month securities in order to contain

the growth of money. The average yield on these was in the

range 14.08-18.10 per cent per annum.

Despite the high growth in money supply, the slowing down of foreign capital inflows and increased domestic demand for funds led to a shortage of liquid funds and a corresponding rise in interest rates towards the end of the year. There was increased demand for credit by the Government on account of the higher than anticipated defence and welfare expenditure, following the breakdown of the peace talks in April and the rise in wheat prices. Reduced inflows from abroad, the inability to raise funds in a sluggish stock market, inflationary expectations and cash flow problems of the corporate sector all contributed to a heightened demand for bank credit from the private sector. These factors led to an increase in Treasury bill yields from 14.34 per cent in March to 18.68 per cent in December. Meanwhile, call money rates rose from 18 - 25 per cent in March to 20 - 58 per cent by end December. Also, reflecting speculative behaviour, the money market displayed

extraordinary volatility in the movement of daily call money

rates.

To ease the tightness in the money market, the Central

Bank intervened to purchase Treasury bills in the secondary

market and decided to retire its own securities on maturity.

Further, it commenced a Reverse Repurchase Facility in

November. The facility was expected to provide liquidity to

the market on an overnight basis and also dampen

speculative activity in the market. In addition, the Bank

reduced the rediscount rate, which is charged on Treasury

bill purchases of the Central Bank. Further, the Central Bank

announced in late December that, effective from the

beginning of 1996, commercial banks would be permitted to

borrow abroad, upto 5 per cent of their capital and reserves.

This measure was also considered as a part of the ongoing

process of further liberalising transactions. The Bank also

used moral suasion to discourage commercial banks from

lending to their customers for speculative purposes.

Consequently, stability was restored to the money market. At

the same time, enhanced liquidity led to a moderation in

interest rates from very high levels.

In order to contain domestic credit expansion, however, the Central Bank continued to maintain the SRR at a relatively high rate of 15 per cent throughout the year, though the SRR on foreign currency deposits placed abroad continued to attract a concessionary SRR of 5 per cent. The Central Bank also refrained from granting new credit under the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund (MLCF), although requests for finance from distressed finance companies continued to be accommodated on a case by case basis. Consequently, the outstanding level of refinance facilities granted to distressed finance companies under the MLCF increased from Rs.2,304 million at end 1994 to Rs.2,473 million at end 1995. In keeping with the current policies to minimise refinance, the overall outstanding refinance under both short-term facilities and the MLCF, net of provisions for loan losses, was reduced from Rs.3,376 million at end 1994 to Rs.2,800 million at end 1995.

10.3 Interest Rates

Short-term interest rates dropped in early 1995,

reflecting a significant easing of liquidity mainly due to the

retirement of Central Bank securities, increased provisional

advances to the Government and transfer of Central Bank

profits to the Government. This trend reversed drastically

from the second quarter of the year with a tightening of the

liquidity caused by reduced foreign inflows, increased

government borrowing and a continued rise in utilisation of

bank credit by the private sector. The average yield rate on

12-month Treasury bills, which declined from 19.43 per cent

at end 1994 to 14.00 per cent in February 1995,

118

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

progressively rose to a peak level of 20.5 per cent by mid-October. Thereafter, the rates dropped slightly until end 1995, but remained above 18 per cent. Call money market rates followed the same trend with a high volatility during the second half of 1995. The medium and long-term rates recorded some fluctuations during the year.

Short Term Interest Rates

With the increase in liquidity, short-term interest rates reflected a downward trend during the first two months of 1995. Treasury bill yield rates remained somewhat stable in March. From April onwards, Treasury bill yield rates moved in a steady upward direction as the market experienced a tight liquidity situation. Call money market rates followed suit with wide fluctuations on a few occasions in the second half of the year. In the last quarter of the year, call money

market rates rose to very high levels with high volatility.

Increased demand for funds by non-commercial bank

participants such as development banks and merchant banks

and a shortage of short-term funds with the state banks due

to cash flow problems experienced by the Government were

mainly responsible for the excessive rise in interest rates

during this period. With a view to stabilising call money

market rates, the Central Bank introduced a reverse

repurchase scheme in Treasury bills in November 1995 under

which short-term funds were provided to eligible borrowers.

This scheme had its limitations in influencing short-term

interest rates as it was confined to commercial banks which

were approved dealers in Treasury bills and the amounts

offered were relatively small compared to the increased

demand for short-term liquidity, and due to market

imperfections.

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

The average yield rates on Treasury bills declined from

a range of 48.75 - 49:43 per cent at end December 1994 to

a range of 13.24 - 14.00 per cent in the first week of

-February, reflecting normal seasonality. Treasury bill primary

auctions were heavily oversubscribed during this period. The

Central Bank continued its open market operations to mop

up excess liquidity. Accordingly, the Central Bank's holdings

of Treasury bills declined from Rs.5,093 million at end 1994

to Rs.492 million by mid-February 1995. The Treasury bill

yield rates were on an upward direction particularly from

April and reached 16.36 - 16.47 per cent by end June. Call

money market rates, which dropped to a range of 6.00-14.00

per cent in the third week of January from a range between

20.00-23.00 per cent at end 1994, rose to 23.00-34.00 per

cent by end June. Several developments such as reduced

foreign inflows, a weakening in the Government's cash

position and mopping up operations of the Central Bank,

which absorbed Rs. 1,670 million through the issue of its own

securities during March to May, were responsible for a tight

liquidity situation in the market.

During the first half of 1995, the yield rates on the

Central Bank's sales (discounting) and purchases

(rediscounting) of Treasury bills in the secondary market

fluctuated, following the general trends in other short-term

rates in the money market. The discount rates, which stood

at 18.48 per cent for 3-month Treasury bills and 19.18 per

cent for 12-month Treasury bills at end 1994, gradually

dropped to 12.99 per cent and 13.75 per cent, respectively,

in the first week of February and increased thereafter, in line

with market trends, to reach 15.53 per cent and 15.84 per

cent, respectively, by end June 1995.

The repo rate was reduced from 20 per cent at end

1994 to 12.00 per cent in the third week of March 1995.

This rate was then raised to 15 per cent in May and

subsequently reduced to 13.5 per cent at end June 1995.

The second half of the year witnessed a sharp upward movement in short-term interest rates due to a tightening of the liquidity situation as mentioned earlier. Yield rates on 12-month Treasury bills at the primary auctions rose from 16.47 per cent at end June to a peak level of 20.54 per cent in October. Thereafter, with an injection of funds by the Central Bank, as evident from the increase in its Treasury bill holdings from Rs.9.1 billion at end October to Rs.12.5 billion by end December, the Treasury bill rates indicated a marginal decline during the last quarter of 1995. From November 1995, the average yield rates on 3-month and 6-month bills were higher than the average yield rate on 12-month bills, reflecting a market perception of a future drop in interest rates.

Call market rates rose to unprecedentedly high levels in July 1995 and in the last quarter. During the last quarter, a reduction in the supply of funds to the call money market by the two state banks due to delays in settlement of obligations by the Government, an increased demand for funds by non-commercial bank participants and greater reliance on call market funds by other financial institutions including merchant banks exerted pressure on interest rates. Under the impetus of these factors, despite the injection of funds by the Central Bank through its activities in the primary and secondary markets for Treasury bills and reverse repo transactions, call money market rates fluctuated between 16.00 - 102 per cent in December. The reverse repo scheme was not effective enough in containing call money market rates when pressures for funds originated from institutions which were not eligible to be covered by the scheme. In addition, structural-weaknesses in the financial system constrained the effective use of the reverse repo scheme to stabilise short-term interest rates at reasonably low levels. However, in mid-December, market liquidity improved to some extent after a special issue of Treasury bills and the receipt of privatisation proceeds on account of the sale of Colombo Gas Company which enabled the Government to settle part of its obligations to the state banks. At end December, call money rates were in a range of 20.00 - 58.00 per cent. The continued presence of non-commercial bank financial institutions as major borrowers and seasonally high transaction demand for credit during the festive season in December kept the interest rates from falling.

During the second half of 1995, the discount rate in the secondary market for Treasury bills and the repo rate were on an upward trend following the general movement in short-term interest rates. These rates were raised to attractive levels in the last quarter of the year to encourage purchases of Treasury bills from the Central Bank's portfolio. Accordingly, the discount rate and the repo rate had been raised to 19.01 per cent and 16.50 per cent by end December 1995. Meanwhile, the rediscount rate was maintained at a relatively low level (20.47 per cent) in December to provide liquidity to the market at a reasonable rate. The weighted average yield rate on reverse repo transactions varied between 22.60 - 50.00 per cent in December reflecting heavy demand for short-term funds in the market.

The coupon rate on Central Bank Securities, which remained unchanged at 13 per cent at the first twelve issues in 1995, was raised to 15.5 per cent at the last two issues, made in August and September. The weighted average yield rate on these securities rose to 14.08 per cent at the issue made on 24 March 1995 and to 16.60 per cent at the issue made on 28 June 1995. Thereafter, with minor fluctuations, the yield rate rose to 18.6 per cent at the 6 September 1995 issue, which was the last issue for the year.

120

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

The weighted average lending rate of commercial banks declined from 18.5 per cent at the end of 1994 to 16.4 per cent by end March 1995, conforming to the general trends in other short-term interest rates. The rate then rose to 20.0 per cent by end June 1995 and further to 20.5 per cent at end September. Meanwhile, the weekly Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR) declined from 18.5 per cent at end December 1994 to 16.2 per cent by end March 1995 before rising to 16.9 per cent at end June. Thereafter, the AWPR indicated a clear upward trend, reaching 20.1 per cent at end December 1995.

In view of the rising trend in interest rates and the slowing down in the growth of its deposits, the National Savings Bank (NSB) twice raised its interest rate on fixed deposits. The rate was raised from 14 per cent per annum to 15 per cent per annum, with effect from 01 September 1995 and to 16 per cent with effect from 15 December. However, its savings deposit rates remained at 12 per cent throughout the year.

Long Term Rates

Some fluctuations were observed in long-term rates in 1995. The interest rate on government securities with 5 - 7 year maturities was 14 per cent in 1995 compared with 14 - 16 per cent for securities with 3 - 5 year maturities in 1994.

The minimum lending rate of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB) declined from 18 per cent at end 1994 to 17 per cent in January 1995. The lending rates of the National Savings Bank (NSB) declined from a range of 18 - 21 per cent at end 1994 to a range between 17 - 20 per cent in May 1995. In contrast, the lending rates of the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) increased from a range of 18 - 22 per cent to a range between 20 - 24 per cent from January 1995. Meanwhile, the lending rates of the National Development Bank (NDB), which ranged between 16.5 - 22.0 per cent at end 1994, rose to a range of 19.5 - 26 per cent. The refinance rate under the Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMI)-IV Scheme, which is fixed on the basis of the AWDR of commercial banks, was reduced from 13.6 per cent at end 1994 to 12.5 per cent by end 1995.

10.4 Commercial Banking

In the context of a tight monetary policy, high interest

rates and expanding credit demand by the private sector,

liquid assets of commercial banks increased at a slower pace

of 7 per cent (Rs.5,526 million) in 1995 compared to a rise

of 19 per cent (Rs.12,204 million) in the previous year.

Consequently, the ratio of liquid assets to total deposits fell

from 40 per cent at end 1994 to 36 per cent at end 1995.

Structure of Assets and Liabilities

The total assets/liabilities of commercial banks rose by 19 per cent during the year, in comparison to an increase of 14 per cent in nominal GDP, indicating a further deepening of banking activity. The share of total loans and advances in total assets increased from 51 per cent in 1994 to 56 per cent in 1995, reflecting high credit demand. During the year, total loans and advances increased by 31 per cent (Rs.43,772 million) mainly on account of increases in overdraft facilities by 40 per cent (Rs. 18,272 million) and loans by 25 per cent (Rs.21,474 million).

On the liabilities side, major increases were recorded in total domestic deposits, paid up capital and reserves and foreign currency liabilities with correspondent banks. Total deposits increased by 20 per cent (Rs.38,247 million) during the year on account of increases in time and savings deposits by 24 per cent (Rs.37,337 million) and demand deposits by 2 per cent (Rs.870 million). Total deposits as a percentage of total assets remained around 69 per cent as in the previous year. Domestic inter-bank borrowings increased by 35 per cent (Rs.3,668 million), while foreign borrowings also increased by 33 per cent (Rs.683 million) during the year, reflecting a high credit demand which was not matched by a corresponding increase in deposits.

Paid up capital and reserves increased by 18.3 per cent

(Rs.5,181 million) during the year, partly due to the

commencement of operations by three new banks, while the

ratio of capital and reserves to total assets remained around

10 per cent in 1995 as in the previous year.

Sources and Uses of Funds

For the year as a whole, the foreign sector, inter-bank

transactions, other liabilities including the capital and reserve

base of commercial banks, the government sector and

government corporations were net providers of resources to

commercial banks, while the other domestic private sector,

the Central Bank and co-operatives absorbed resources from

commercial banks. Total net availability of funds increased

by Rs.13,478 million in 1995, in comparison to an increase

of Rs.15,765 million in 1994.

The foreign sector emerged as a major source of funds

for commercial banks in the form of borrowings, deposits

and foreign balances in 1995, providing a sum of Rs.6,372

million. In contrast, this sector was a net user of commercial

bank funds during the previous two years.

The government sector contributed a net resource build up of Rs.595 million in comparison to an amount of Rs.605 million provided in the previous year. This was mainly due to an increase in government deposits by Rs.193 million and a decrease in investments in Treasury bills by Rs.4,186

million during the year. Meanwhile, the government sector absorbed commercial bank funds through enhanced import bills, short-term credit and overdraft facilities to the value of Rs.3,785 million. Government corporations became a marginal net supplier of funds, providing Rs.35 million in

1995, as compared to Rs.6,343 million supplied in 1994. This change was largely due to increased borrowings by three major corporations - the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment and the Ceylon Electricity Board.

An enhanced capital and reserve base brought in Rs.5,182 million to the banking system. This was partly on account of three new commercial banks entering the Sri Lankan banking system during the latter part of 1995. In addition, inter-bank transactions were a source of funds on a net basis as in the previous year, providing Rs.2,005 million to the commercial banks' resource base.

The other domestic private sector emerged as a major

user of commercial bank funds in 1995. It utilised a sum

of Rs. 6,873 million on a net basis, as compared with Rs.

3,192 million in the previous year. This increase corresponds to the increase in credit to the private sector, where the annual growth rose from 21.2 per cent in 1994 to 28.2 per cent in 1995. Commercial banks provided funds to the domestic private sector mainly through enhanced overdrafts and new loan facilities to the extent of Rs.36,661 million. Meanwhile, deposit mobilisation efforts taken by the commercial banks through new products and schemes in a competitive environment enabled them to mobilise additional deposits to the value of Rs.31,303 million.

The Central Bank absorbed Rs.4,774 million worth of funds from the commercial banking system through the placements of funds by banks on account of reserve requirements. An increase in commercial bank reserves held with the Central Bank by Rs.7,180 million in respect of the increased deposit base was partly offset by a large decrease in investments in Central Bank securities by Rs.3,146 million during the year. Meanwhile, the use of funds by co-operatives amounted to Rs. 1,832 million during the year. This was by way of increased advances amounting to

Rs. 1,398 million and a draw-down of Rs.434 million in deposits.

Commercial Bank Loans and Advances*

Commercial banks increased their lending to all sectors of the economy. The bulk of loans and advances was of a short-term nature and was for trading purposes. Short-term advances accounted for 65 per cent (Rs.l 14,637 million) of total advances, while the relative shares of medium-term and long-term advances were 21 per cent (Rs.37,090 million) and 14 per cent (Rs.24,074 million), respectively.

Trading activities continued to be the most attractive area for lending operations for commercial banks. Nearly 44 per cent of total loans and advances were channelled to finance trading activities, consisting of exports, imports and domestic trade. Such loans and advances rose by 23 per cent during the twelve months ending September 1995. Most of this credit was for working capital requirements.

The second most important area of commercial bank lending was the industrial sector. Industrial credit grew by 25 per cent during the 12 month period ending September 1995, as compared to a growth of 14 per cent in the corresponding period in 1994, while its share of total loans remained at 14 per cent. This was partly due to the re-entry of the two state banks into the SMI scheme. Even in this sector, the major portion of credit outstanding fell into the short-term category. The share of short-term credits in this sector increased from 70 per cent of the total credit to the sector at end September 1994 to 73 per cent at end September 1995.

Credit to the agricultural sector, which includes tea,

rubber, coconut, paddy, livestock and dairy farming, grew by

4 per cent during the 12 months ending September 1995 as

compared to a growth of 10 per cent at end September 1994.

The share of agricultural credit in total outstanding loans and

advances was 6 per cent at end September 1995.

Outstanding bank credit in respect of housing and property development accounted for 12 per cent of the total outstanding credit at end September 1995. As the activities in this sector remained sluggish, bank credit to this sector registered a moderate growth of 5 per cent during the period under review. The major share of advances for housing and property development fell into the long-term category (49 per

cent). Meanwhile, credit to the financial sector, amounting to Rs.8,102 million, accounted for 5 per cent of the total outstanding credit and showed an increase of 29 per cent at end September 1995.

Despite the relatively high growth in overall credit from the banking sector, the growth of credit for consumption purposes declined significantly in 1995. Credit to this

per cent rise in the previous year, and remained at 8 per cent

of the total credit outstanding at the end of September 1995.

Banks increased the interest rates charged on loans and

advances, following the trend observed in other interest rates

in the market. The weighted average interest rate on all loans

and advances rose from 19.7 per cent at end December 1994

to 20.5 per cent at end September 1995. As at end

September 1995, 35 per cent of commercial bank loans and

advances carried interest rates in the range of 21-25 per cent,

a similar proportion to that which prevailed at end September

1994. Meanwhile, 22 per cent of loans and advances had

interest rates in the range of 18-29 per cent. The share of

loans and advances earning interest rates within a range of

26-29 per cent was 10 per cent in 1995 compared to 19 per

cent in 1994.

10.5 Central Banking

In the context of tight monetary policy, the monetary

base expanded at a slower rate of 15.5 per cent, to Rs.

78,587 million in 1995, compared to a growth rate of 20.5

per cent in 1994. There was no significant externally induced

growth in reserve money unlike in the previous year.

However, the sale of foreign exchange by commercial banks

contributed to the expansion in the monetary base of Rs.

10,198 million. The increase in net credit to the government

by the Central Bank (by Rs.7,662 million) was the major

contributory factor for the growth of the monetary base in

1995.

Structure of Assets and Liabilities

The total assets/liabilities of the Central Bank expanded

by 11.3 per cent (Rs.17,548 million) and stood at Rs.173,506

million at end 1995. The growth in total assets/liabilities in

the previous year was 16.7 per cent (Rs.22,324 million).

On the assets side, the increase was the combined outcome of an increase in domestic assets of the Central Bank by 12.1 per cent (Rs.7,323 million) and international reserve by 10.7 per cent (Rs.10,225 million). The growth in domestic assets was mainly due to a large increase in Treasury bill holdings and loans and advances to Government.

Despite the overall deficit in the balance of payments, the international reserve of the Central Bank increased from Rs.95,671 million in 1994 to Rs.105,896 million in 1995 due to the sale of foreign exchange by commercial banks, foreign investment income accruing to the Central Bank and the revaluation effects related to exchange rate variations.

Deposit liabilities of the Central Bank increased by Rs. 13,074 million, owing to an increase in deposits of commercial banks by Rs.7,021 million corresponding to the increased reserve requirement on the increased deposit base, while deposits of international organisations increased by Rs.5,089 million. Currency issues (notes and coins) of the Central Bank in 1995 increased by Rs.3,603 million compared with an increase of Rs.7,132 million in 1994, indirectly reflecting the impact of tight monetary policy.

10.6 Banking Development

Branch Expansion

The competitiveness and dynamism in the financial sector were further enhanced in 1995 by the commencement of operations of three new commercial banks, bringing the total number of comercial banks in operation to 26 by the end of the year. Two domestic private commercial banks, namely, Pan Asia Bank Ltd. and Union Bank of Colombo

Ltd., were opened during the year, thus raising the total

number of domestic banks to eight. A well reputed Korean

commercial bank, Korea Exchange Bank Ltd., also

established a branch in Colombo bringing the number of

foreign banks operating in Sri Lanka to 18.

The bank branch network also continued to increase during the year with a consequent expansion in banking services. An important development in bank branch expansion in 1995 was the opening of branches in India and Pakistan by Bank of Ceylon, facilitating Sri Lanka's transactions with these two countries. Domestic commercial banks opened 24 branches in 1995 (of which six were opened by the two state banks) as compared to 27 new branches operated in the preceding year. The total number of branches opened by foreign commercial banks increased to 37 with the opening of a branch by the Korea Exchange Bank Ltd. Therefore, the total number of commercial bank branches rose to 901 by end 1995, from 876 at end 1994. With the increase in the branch network of the National Savings Bank (NSB) by six and RRDB branches by two, the total number of bank branches rose to 1,168. Accordingly, banking density, as measured by the total number of bank branches for each 10,000 population, increased from 0.6349 in 1994 to 0.6403 in 1995.

The branch network of People's Bank increased to 325

by end 1995 with the opening of a new branch and the

reopening of a branch that had been previously closed. Bank

of Ceylon (BOC) opened two new domestic branches and

two overseas branches, in Madras and Karachchi, while

upgrading nine of its Agrarian Service Centre (ASC)

branches to fully fledged bank branches, thus raising its total

number of main branches from 262 at end 1994 to 273 at

end 1995. Accordingly, the branch network of BOC

consisted of 273 main branches, 19 ASC branches, 23

Kachcheri branches, 18 extension offices, three pay offices

and four overseas branches.

Hatton National Bank Ltd. opened seven new branches, while Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. established two new branches during the year. Seylan Bank Ltd. expanded its branch network by opening seven new branches. Meanwhile, Sampath Bank Ltd. opened three new branches.

The National Savings Bank (NSB) established six new

branches, expanding its branch network to 96. Though the

total number of RRDBs remained at 17 during the year, the

Gampaha and Kandy RRDBs opened one branch each,

bringing the total number of RRDB branches (including

Head Office branches) operating in the country to 171 at end

1995.

Agency Banking

As in the previous year, the two state banks engaged

in agency banking activities through the Praja Naya

Niyamaka (PNN) Scheme. However, activities of the PNN

Scheme were at a much slower pace than in the previous

year. The total number of PNNs operating was 9,248

compared to 10,376 in 1994. No new PNNs were appointed

during the year. However, Rs.3 million was granted under

this Scheme during the year while total outstanding loans

stood at Rs.389 million at end 1995. Meanwhile, the total

outstanding loans granted by Sampath Bank Ltd. under its

Sampath Seva Sanyojaka (SSS) Scheme was Rs. 9 million,

with Rs.l million being granted during the year. The total

number of active Sampath Seva Sanyojakas was 10 at end

1995.

Banking Facilities

The highly competitive environment in the banking

sector led commercial banks to expand their customer service

facilities further during the year through a number of

innovative products. Such facilities provided by the

commercial banks during the year included new deposit and

loan schemes, installation of additional Automated Teller

Machines (ATMs) and electronic money transfer facilities.

The Direct Debit Transfer Scheme of the Sri Lanka

Inter-Bank Payment System (SLIPS) was introduced in

126

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

February 1995. This scheme facilitates the transfer of funds

from an account of a customer of one bank to an account

of a customer of another bank through a direct debit order.

People's Bank launched a new deposit-cum-loan scheme, named 'Gurusetha', under which loans are granted to teachers. Bank of Ceylon launched a credit scheme called 'Ran Govi Upahara Programme' to provide credit facilities to farmers who have a satisfactory record in repaying agricultural loans. Hatton National Bank Ltd. (HNB) introduced a new deposit scheme especially designed for women, called 'Pragathi Kantha' current accounts. Women entrepreneurs who hold current accounts under this scheme were given facilities such as a free standing order service, free cheque books and concessions on the issue of drafts and traveller's cheques, in addition to guidance, support and assistance from the bank. HNB also introduced a new credit facility under which franchise holders of the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) were granted credit facilities. Standard Chartered Bank Ltd. launched a new savings deposit scheme which included an entitlement to a lucky draw.

Free life insurance cover was provided by Pan Asia Bank Ltd. to its fixed deposit holders who have a minimum deposit of Rs.25,000 and by the HNB to its current account holders who have maintained a minimum balance of Rs.25,000.

HNB and Sampath Bank Ltd. became participatory credit institutions (PCIs) under the Fisheries Sector Community Development Credit Scheme (FSCDCS) funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during the year. In addition, these two banks, together with Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd., became PCIs for the Pollution Control and Abatement Fund (PCAF) which was established to provide financial assistance at low cost to industrial enterprises for waste minimisation, resource recovery, pollution control and abatement. Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank were re-admitted as participatory lending institutions under the SMI-IV after satisfactory fulfilment of capital adequacy ratios and audit requirements. The entry of the two state banks accelerated the utilisation of fund available under the SMI-IV, exhausting almost all the funds at end 1995.

During 1995, 25 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) were installed by seven banks, thus bringing the total number of ATMs to 135 at end year. Hatton National Bank Ltd. permitted withdrawals from NRFC accounts through ATMs.

10.7 Credit Information Bureau

During 1995 the Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka maintained its services to the shareholder lending

institutions by the performance of its principal activities of

collecting credit information, developing the data base on

borrowers and supplying credit reports on borrowers.

The Bureau was able to improve the quality of its

reports by progressively accelerating the updating of the

database thereby ensuring the supply of a more accurate and

up-to-date report. While the updating of the 'irregular' loan

database was reduced to monthly intervals a major portion

of the 'regular' loan database continued to be updated at

quarterly intervals. The reporting floors remained at

Rs.100,000 for 'irregular' loan accounts and Rs.500,000 for

'regular' loan accounts.

By end 1995 the database of the Bureau had a store

of 65,931 loan accounts. The Bureau supplied 98,282 credit

reports in 1995, as against 71,623 in 1994 and 58,657 in

1993. The credit reports supplied by the Bureau continued

to carry a broad coverage of information including direct

advances, indirect advances and other relevant ancillary

information.

During 1995, the Credit Information Bureau Act was

amended to permit merchant banks and other institutions

engaged in leasing activities to have access to the

information maintained by the Bureau.

10.8 Rural Banking and Rural Credit

Rural Credit Policy

There were no changes to rural credit policy in 1995.

Bank lending to the agriculture sector under the New

Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) was out of

their own funds supported by an interest subsidy paid by the

Government so as to maintain the lending rates to farmers

at a relatively low level. The Central Bank's involvement in

the area of rural credit remained unchanged, except for the

provision of refinance. The Bank continued to provide a

credit guarantee cover for loans granted under the NCRCS,

co-ordinated and directed rural credit policy, effected the

payment of the interest subsidy to lending banks and

continued to monitor and supervise loan recovery and other

rural credit schemes. The termination of the Central Bank's

refinance scheme restricted the resource-poor Regional Rural

Development Banks (RRDBs) in their lending to the

agriculture sector; but commercial banks, especially the two

state banks, stepped up their lending to this sector, off-setting

the reduced operations of the RRDBs. The new policy

demonstrated that lending banks were in a position to supply

the funds needed by the rural sector out of their own

resources, provided proper incentives were offered.

The relief package announced by the Government in

1994 came into operation in 1995 and was continued during

the year. The Central Bank, on behalf of the Government,

co-ordinated the loan write-off scheme by issuing necessary

instructions to lending banks. About 35,000 farmers took

advantage of the relief scheme to have their past-due loans

written off by lending banks by paying 25 per cent of the

principal sum in default. The Scheme had an adverse impact

on loan recovery; the recovery rates fell from a normal level

of 75 - 85 per cent, to a much lower level of 45 - 50 per

cent during the year under review.

The Central Bank continued to function as the executing agency for a number of foreign funded credit schemes in 1995, supporting the lending operations of participating credit institutions (PCIs) with refinance drawn under various lines of credit. Unlike the schemes funded by the Central Bank's own refinance, these foreign funded schemes were not considered to interfere unduly with the Bank's monetary policy stance. In the case of ADB funded loan schemes, the lending rate and the Central Bank's refinance rate were reduced by 2 percentage points to 14 per cent and 6 per cent per annum, respectively. This downward revision in the interest rates was required to eliminate the disparity created by the reduction of lending rates by the two state banks for agriculture, exports and industry in late 1994 in an effort to promote growth and employment in the economy.

New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS)

The total value of credit disbursed by banks out of their

own funds under the NCRCS in 1995 amounted to Rs.1,180

million, reflecting an increase of 21 per cent over the

previous year's disbursement. Further, the total number of

loans granted under the NCRCS during the year increased

from 58,836 in 1994 to 82,000 in 1995. This sharp

improvement in the performance of the NCRCS during the

year under reference was mainly due to many farmers

becoming eligible, despite their previous loan defaults, to

obtain fresh loans under the relief package announced by the

Government in 1994. Of the total amount of credit disbursed

under the NCRCS, Maha 1994/95 accounted for Rs.791

million, while Yala 1995 accounted for the balance. The

major share of loans granted under the NCRCS was for

cultivation of paddy, accounting for 70 per cent of the credit

disbursed in 1995, while the balance 30 per cent was for

the cultivation of subsidiary food crops.

The interest subsidy scheme for cultivation loans introduced by the Government in 1994 continued without change during 1995. Under this facility, an interest subsidy of 7.5 percentage points per annum on the amount of loans granted by banks for a maximum period of 270 days was made available to banks by the Government to enable them

128

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

to lend to farmers at 16 per cent per annum. In practice, however, many farmers tend to repay their loans in a much shorter period than 270 days and the draw-down on the interest subsidy funds was less than originally anticipated. The total value of the interest subsidy paid to banks in 1995 on account of cultivation loans disbursed during Yala 1994 amounted to Rs.14 million. The Government agreed to extend the relief scheme announced in 1994 to defaulting farmers until Yala 1997. The extension of the relief scheme would help more farmers to have their defaulted loans written-off by banks on payment of 25 per cent of the principal. Further, this would make them eligible to obtain fresh loans as borrowers in good standing. The Government's relief package required the Central Bank to relax its credit guarantee rules, necessitating the waiver of the condition requiring institution of legal action by PCIs to qualify to receive the full amount of the credit guarantee. In terms of this waiver, the Bank underwrites 50 per cent of the principal amount in loss remaining after the payment of 25 per cent by farmers. The general credit guarantee rules will continue to apply to new loans granted under the NCRCS. Representing a further relaxation of general conditions governing the credit guarantee scheme, the Bank made an advance payment of 25 per cent of the estimated total liability on defaulted loans to help RRDBs adversely affected by the Relief Package. Total advance payments to RRDBs upto end 1995 amounted to Rs.60 million.

The normal indemnity paid by the Central Bank under

the credit guarantee scheme in respect of non-recoverable

NCRCS loans amounted to Rs.6 million in 1995, raising the

total indemnity so paid to Rs.144 million as at end year.

This compares with a total premium collection of Rs.28

million under the credit guarantee scheme for the NCRCS

by the Bank upto the end of 1995.

Crop Insurance Schemes

Crop insurance was provided by the Agricultural Insurance Board (MB) on an island-wide basis and Ceylinco Insurance Company Ltd. (CICL) in selected areas during 1995. In 1995, the total extent of paddy land insured by the AIB under its schemes stood at 71,000 hectares, while that by CICL amounted to 349 hectares. The AIB collected premia amounting to Rs.40 million as against indemnity payments of Rs.25 million. CICL, which collected premia amounting to Rs.0.25 million, made indemnity payments of Rs.0.12 million. A salient feature in crop insurance schemes has been the continuous increase in the area insured and the indemnity payments. The introduction of private crop insurance, though on a negligible scale, could be viewed as a salutary development, since the AIB is unable to cater to the entire crop insurance needs of the country in view of its limited resources. However, legal constraints stand in the way of private insurers penetrating the market on an appreciable scale, since the AIB Act provides a virtual monopoly on crop insurance to the AIB. In view of the need for privatising crop insurance business in Sri Lanka, it is necessary to consider amending the AIB Act to make crop insurance optional and to permit state sector banks to accept private crop insurance policies as collateral for loans.

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

Credit Facilities to the Rural Sector

Credit to the rural sector in Sri Lanka during 1995 was channelled mainly through the Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs), Co-operative Rural Banks (CRBs), People's Bank outstation branches, Bank of Ceylon sub-offices at Agrarian Services Centres (ASCs) and Thrift & Credit Co-operative Societies (TCCSs). The total quantum of loans disbursed by Bank of Ceylon and TCCSs to the rural sector in 1995 amounted to Rs.246 million and Rs. 1,525 million, respectively. This compares with Rs.258 million and Rs. 1,270 million disbursed to the rural sector by the respective institutions during the previous year.

Mobilisation of Rural Savings

As the rural sector is important in the economy,

mobilisation of rural savings will generate a significant flow

of resources for investment. Hence, effective measures to

mobilise rural savings should constitute an essential

component in any strategy to develop a viable rural financial

market. In Sri Lanka, the savings of the rural sector are

primarily mobilised by the CRBs, RRDBs and TCCSs. The

total savings mobilised from the rural sector, other than by

RRDBs, stood at Rs.9.6 billion at end 1995 compared to

Rs.8.5 billion at end 1994, indicating an increase of 11.4 per

cent.

10.9 Other Financial Institutions

Savings Institutions

The National Savings Bank (NSB), the premier savings institution in the country, continued to expand its deposit base during 1995. The expansion was at a much slower pace than in 1994, due to a delayed response to rising interest rates elsewhere in the market. Total deposits rose by 8 per cent (Rs.4,430 million) to Rs.57,756 million, compared with an increase of 27 per cent (Rs. 11,169 million) in the previous year. Of the total increase in the deposit base, the increase in fixed deposits accounted for 77 per cent (Rs.3,414 million), and the increase in savings deposits for 22 per cent (Rs.975 million). Meanwhile, deposits under the NSB pension scheme and premium savings bonds showed some increase during the year.

Interest rates on savings deposits, which were reduced by 2 per cent to 12 per cent at the beginning of the year, remained at this level throughout the year. Interest rates on 12-month fixed deposits, which had been reduced from 16 per cent to 14 per cent in December 1994 in line with falling market rates, remained at this level throughout much of the year, despite a rise in interest rates elsewhere, notably on

Treasury bills. However, although delayed, a response was

made to rising interest rates in the Treasury bill market, with

the interest rate on one year fixed deposits being revised

upward in September 1995 from 14 per cent to 15 per cent

and further increased to 16 per cent in December 1995. The

interest rate in respect of one year deposits on which interest

was paid monthly was also increased from 13.2 per cent to

13.8 per cent in September and to 14.4 per cent in December

1995.

Total investments increased by 8.4 per cent (Rs.4,091

million) to Rs.52,535 million at the end of the year.

Investments in rupee securities and debentures increased by

13.5 per cent (Rs.4,155 million) and 143 per cent (Rs. 1,840

million), respectively, while investments in Treasury bills

decreased by 12.5 per cent (Rs.1,679 million) in 1995.

Activities of the Employees' Trust Fund (ETF)

expanded slightly during 1995. Total contributions received

by the Fund during the year were Rs. 1,500 million,

compared to receipts amounting to Rs.1,457 million in 1994.

The total outstanding value of members' balance increased

by 24 per cent to Rs.12,315 million. The bulk of ETF

resources was invested in government securities. Investments

in government securities accounted for 66 per cent of total

investments, compared to 62 per cent recorded in the

previous year. Equity investments by the Fund increased by

17.8 per cent to Rs.1,384 million at end 1995.

According to provisional data, the total members'

balance of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) increased

by 8 per cent, to Rs. 82 billion, at end 1995. Total

contributions received by the Fund also expanded from Rs.

7.4 billion in 1994 to 8.2 billion in 1995. With the

investment of these contributions and the income from

investments already made, net of the benefits paid to

members (amounting to Rs. 2.7 billion), EPF investments

rose by Rs. 19 billion, to Rs. 100 billion at end 1995. This

makes the EPF by far the largest single investor in the

domestic market.

Long Term Lending Institutions

The Development Finance Corporation of Sri Lanka

Ltd. (DFCC) was able to expand its long-term lending

activities further during 1995. The number of loans approved

during the year increased substantially from 678 in 1994 to

1,248 in 1995. Of the total number of loans approved, 527

loans were for the industrial sector, 341 loans were for the

agricultural sector and 268 loans were disbursed to the

tourism sector. The total outstanding value of loans was

Rs.9,184 million at the end of the year compared to Rs.7,223

million at the end of the previous year. The total value of

loans disbursed by the DFCC amounted to Rs.3,687 million

as compared to Rs.2,748 million in the previous year. The

bulk of loans (57 per cent) disbursed during the period was

for industrial purposes, while Rs.724 million (20 per cent)

was granted to the tourism sector for construction of tourist

hotels. The agricultural sector (Rs.269 million) and the

financial sector (Rs.351 million) were other major recipients

of credit during the year. The DFCC provided Rs.361 million

by way of equity finance to 20 companies. Equity finance

facilities amounting to Rs.142 million and Rs.lll million

were provided to nine companies in the financial sector and

eight companies in the manufacturing sector. The main

sources of funds of the DFCC during the year were

repayment of loans by customers, issue of debentures and

borrowings from the International Development Association

(IDA) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). A sum of

Rs.2,471 million was raised through the issue of debentures,

while Rs.2,481 million and Rs. 1,147 million were obtained

by way of recoveries of loans and borrowings from IDA and

ADB, respectively.

The National Development Bank (NDB) also expanded

its activities in 1995. Total loans approved by the NDB

increased by 14 per cent to Rs.6,519 million at end 1995.

Of the total loan approvals, 53 per cent (Rs.3,437 million)

was for the industrial sector, with the total number of loan

approvals for this sector being 258. Meanwhile, Rs.1,117

million and Rs.1,153 million were approved for the tourism sector and property development, respectively. The NDB also provided equity finance facilities totalling Rs.477 million to 10 companies in the industrial, tourism and financial sectors. Of the total equity financing, Rs.249 million was provided to three companies in the tourism sector, while Rs.198 million financed six companies in the industrial sector. The main sources of funds were recovery of loans (Rs.3,414 million), loans under ADB and IDA credit lines (Rs.1,815 million) and borrowings abroad (Rs.222 million).

As in the past, the State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB) engaged in long-term lending activities primarily for housing purposes. The total number of loans approved during the year was 4,862, with a value of Rs.875 million. The bulk of the loans given by the Bank was for housing purposes. According to provisional figures, the number of housing loans approved during the year was 4,567, with a value of Rs.818 million, compared to Rs.887 million in the previous year. Of the total value of housing loans approved in 1995, Rs.294 million was in respect of low income housing projects under the ADB and the USAID programmes. During the period, the SMIB approved loans for agricultural purposes, including purchase of agricultural land, machinery and tractors, to the value of Rs.25 million. Meanwhile, Rs.738 million was disbursed during the year. The total value of housing loans disbursed during 1995 was Rs.687 million.

Both the National Housing Development Authority

(NHDA) and Housing Development Finance Corporation of

Sri Lanka Ltd. (HDFC) concentrated their lending activities

on credit for housing purposes. The NHDA approved 26,851

loans to the value of Rs.875 million in 1995, of which

Rs.373 million was disbursed during the year. This compared

with approvals of loans to the value of Rs.547 million and

disbursements of Rs.454 million in the previous year. The

HDFC approved Rs.555 million in 1995, while Rs. 469

million was disbursed during the period under review as

against total loan approvals of Rs.291 million and total

disbursements of Rs.255 million in 1994.

Finance Companies

The total number of finance companies licensed with

the Central Bank continued to remain at 24 during 1995.

Total resources (assets/liabilities) of the finance companies

amounted to Rs.15,085 million at end 1995, recording an

increase of Rs.3,211 million (27 per cent). Investor

confidence in finance companies appeared to be restored to

a great extent. The growth in 1995 followed the growth in

operations in 1994, when total assets/liabilities grew by 32

per cent. The current decline in the share market and

attractive interest rates offered by finance companies are

important factors that have contributed to this growth.

Reflecting a similar trend as in 1994, total loans outstanding showed a significant increase of Rs.2,752 million (64 per cent). In 1995, hire purchase financing expanded by Rs.420 million as against an increase of Rs.78 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, investments, which include investments in government securities, investments in subsidiaries, associate companies and parent companies, and other investments, decreased by Rs.877 million.

On the liabilities side, capital and reserves of finance companies rose by Rs.142 million (7 per cent). Deposits with finance companies increased by Rs. 1,439 million (21 per cent) to Rs.8,227 million at end 1995. Borrowings, which include loans from commercial banks, shareholders and directors and other borrowings increased by Rs.477 million (36 per cent).

Relief payments to failed finance companies continued to be made under the MLCF. A net sum of Rs.169 million was provided during 1995, a reduction from the Rs.259 million granted in 1994. Accordingly, the outstanding refinance facilities provided by the Central Bank rose from Rs.2,304 million to Rs.2,473 million by end 1995.

10.10 Specialised Financial Institutions

Merchant Banking

The total income of merchant banks increased by 39 per

cent (Rs.474 million) to Rs.1,689 million in 1995. The

improved income of the industry was attributed mainly to

improvement in income from leasing (Rs.157 million) and

132

discounting trade bills (Rs.40 million). Total assets increased

by 62 per cent to Rs. 12,481 million at the end of the year.

Leasing Companies

As in 1994, there were three companies, namely, Lanka

Orix Leasing Co. Ltd., Commercial Leasing Co. Ltd. and

Mercantile Leasing Co. Ltd., which engaged primarily in

leasing activities in 1995. The total assets of these companies

rose from Rs.2,956 million at end 1994 to Rs.3,631 million

at end 1995. Total lease finance provided by the companies

grew by Rs.295 million to Rs.2,213 million at end 1995.

In terms of lease finance by type of equipment, 57 per

cent of total lease finance was for commercial vehicles.

Meanwhile, on a sectoral basis, the trading sector received

47 per cent of lease finance, while the industrial sector

received 18 per cent.

Venture Capital Companies

Activities of the venture capital companies continued to

expand during the year. According to provisional data, the

total resource base of venture capital companies increased

from Rs.990 million in 1994 to Rs.1,446 million in 1995.

Investments made by venture capital companies in the equity

of projects rose from Rs.435 million in 1994 to Rs.589

million in 1995. Of the total investment, 63 per cent were

allocated for the commencement of new operations, while 31

per cent were for the expansion of existing projects. The

bulk of the investment (62 per cent or Rs.365 million) was

in the manufacturing sector, while 30 per cent and 8 per cent

of total investments were in the services sector and

agricultural sector, respectively.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

Insurance Companies

As in 1994, six insurance companies conducted

operations in 1995. Of these, five undertook both life and

general insurance, while one confined its activities to life

insurance. As a result of increased marketing activity by

these firms and growing awareness of the advantages of

obtaining insurance cover, the insurance industry has tended

to grow in recent years. This trend continued in 1995, with

expansions in life insurance activity, as well as in general

insurance activity, which includes fire, accident, marine and

motor insurance.

The total life premia collected grew by 38 per cent to

Rs. 2,816 million in 1995. The total value of life funds of

the insurance companies rose from Rs. 6,749 million at end

1994 to Rs. 8,598 million at end 1995, while the total

number of life policies in force rose from 558,000 to

723,000

Net premia on account of general insurance rose by 26

per cent to Rs. 2,834 million in 1995. Net premia in the

motor insurance sector, which was the biggest sector in the

general insurance category, increased from Rs. 1,195 million

in 1994 to Rs. 1,460 million in 1995. Net premia of fire

insurance, accident insurance and marine insurance also rose

by 12 per cent, (Rs. 29 million), 28 per cent, (Rs. 175

million) and 67 per cent (Rs. 124 million), respectively.

10.11 Money Market

Overall Trends

With continuing development in the financial sector,

money market activity expanded in 1995. Macro economic

developments, such as the widening fiscal deficit and reduced

inflows from abroad, which led to a general reduction in

liquidity in the latter half of the year, had their repercussions

on the money market. The yield rates determined at the

weekly Treasury bill auctions served as benchmark rates in

the determination of other interest rates. Increased liquidity

in the market in the early part of the year, supported by the

retiring of maturing Treasury bills in January, caused yield

rates of Treasury bills to fall in the first quarter. Increased

borrowing by the Government and reduced foreign inflows

however, led to a shortage in liquidity in the market and a

consequent rise in interest rates thereafter. The liquidity

shortage, especially in the short-term market, was most acute

in the last quarter and pushed up call market rates to

unprecedentedly high levels. The Central Bank introduced a

new facility, the Reverse Repurchase Facility, in November,

to inject liquidity into the market and hence to dampen the

rise in interest rates.

Inter-Bank Call Money Market

Call market transaction volumes were high, following

the trend seen in the past two years. The annual turnover

increased by 40 per cent (to Rs.654 billion), with some

commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions

resorting to the call market to obtain funds for their short

to medium-term operations. Following an initial decline in

rates from a range of 20.00 - 23.00 per cent at end 1994 to

a range of 15.00 - 16.00 per cent at end May 1995, rates

began moving in an upward direction and rose to a range

of 40.00 - 65.00 per cent by mid-July. Although rates

declined somewhat thereafter, they began rising steeply once

again in the last quarter. By early December, rates had risen

to unprecedented heights, with a peak of 102 per cent on 7

December. Large injections of liquidity caused the rates to

fall thereafter, though the level at the end of the year was

still high, in the range 20.00 - 58.00 per cent.

Treasury Bill Market

Primary Treasury Bill Market

The year commenced with increased liquidity and a

consequent demand for Treasury bills, with an associated

reduction in yield rates. A retirement of Rs. 1,600 million

worth of maturing Treasury bills, an increase in provisional

advances from the Central Bank to the Government and the

transfer of Central Bank profits to the Government added to

the liquidity. Despite new issues of Treasury bills and

continued open market operations by the Central Bank to

mop up excess liquidity, primary auctions were

oversubscribed and yield rates fell in the first quarter of

1995. At the last primary auction in March, 3-month bills

had an average weighted yield of 14.03 per cent, in

comparison to a yield of 18.73 per cent at the last auction

in 1994. Correspondingly, the 12-month yield rate fell from

19.43 per cent to 14.61 per cent. Thereafter however, with

reduced liquidity and increased recourse to credit by the

Government, yield rates rose. In addition, the last two

auctions were significantly undersubscribed by the public.

The yield rates at the last auction were 19.26 per cent on

3-month bills and 18.97 per cent on 12-month bills. From

the middle of November however, auction bids resulted in

an inverted yield curve with 3-month rates exceeding

12-month rates, indicating a market perception that interest

rates would decline in the future. For the year as a whole,

Rs. 16,475 million worth of new Treasury bills were issued,

while Rs. 1,600 million worth of bills were retired. Of these

new issues, Rs.4,350 million were special issues, taken up

directly by the Central Bank.

Central Bank Secondary Treasury Bill Market

The Central Bank continued to use the secondary

Treasury bill market for its open market operations, both to

absorb excess liquidity in the early part of the year and to

inject liquidity in the latter part. Central Bank sales

134

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

(discounting) in the secondary market amounted to Rs.17

billion in 1995, in comparison to sales worth Rs.21.2 billion

in 1994, while purchases (rediscounting) in 1995 amounted

to Rs.35.3 billion in comparison to purchases of Rs.18.9

billion in 1994. On a net basis therefore, the Central Bank

injected liquidity amounting to Rs.18.3 billion through its

secondary market operations. The Central Bank's discounting

and rediscounting rates continued to be linked to the yield

on Treasury bills in the primary market. The spread between

these rates, which stood at 4.5 percentage points at the

beginning of 1995, was reduced to 4.25 percentage points

in February, increased to the initial level at the end of March

and further increased to 4.75 percentage points in April, in

order to contain the growth of monetary aggregates. In view

of the reduced liquidity in the market, the spread was

reduced again to 4.5 percentage points in August. From

November onwards the spread was further reduced in steps

to enable banks to obtain liquidity at reasonable rates and

stood at 1.46 percentage points at end 1995.

Central Bank Repurchase Market for Treasury Bills

The Central Bank further used its sales of Treasury bills

with repurchase agreements (repos) in 1995 to stabilise the

call market. Through this mechanism, the Bank was able to

prevent call market rates from falling to very low levels, as

long as it had a portfolio of Treasury bills. However, its

efforts in this regard were sometimes hampered in the early

part of the year by a depletion of its holdings of Treasury

bills.

Repo sales by the Centra! Bank in 1995 amounted to

Rs.198 billion, in comparison to sales of Rs.230.9 billion in

1994. Repurchase agreements could have a duration ranging

from one day (overnight) to 91 days. However, in practice,

repos are usually for less than a week, with the bulk being

overnight repos. The overnight repo rate is determined daily

by the Central Bank, based on market developments. At the

end of 1994, the repo rate was 20.00 per cent. This was

gradually reduced to 12 per cent by mid-March, to be in line

with market liquidity and other interest rates. Thereafter, it

was increased, with some fluctuations, in keeping with other

interest rates and stood at 16.50 per cent at end 1995.

Central Bank Reverse Repurchase Market for Treasury Bills

The introduction of the repo facility by the Central Bank helped to stabilise the lower end of the call market. However, no similar mechanism existed to stabilise the upper end of the market, and hence call market rates rose to very high levels in 1995. In order to create some stability at the upper end of the interest rate range, the Central Bank introduced a reverse repurchase facility in November 1995,

which would enable commercial banks which were approved

Initially, the Central Bank announced the quantum of funds

it was willing to provide to the market and let the rate be

determined on the basis of bids received. Subsequently, in

order to increase the flexibility available to the Central Bank

in its monetary management, the Bank invited bids without

announcing the overall amount offered. The average amount

of liquidity offered per day from 10 November to 11

December 1995 was Rs.495 million, with the maximum

being Rs.1,450 million. Bids received were in the range

18.00 - 50.00 per cent, while the weighted average ranged

from 22.50 per cent to 50.00 per cent. Although the repo

facility did reduce the call market rates to some extent, it

was not entirely successful in limiting the upper end of the

interest range, as indicated earlier. After 11 December, with

an increase of liquidity in the market, the Bank intervened

in the market through the reverse repo facility only twice.

Internal Foreign Exchange Market

The US dollar was maintained as the intervention

currency by the the Central Bank and the Bank continued

to announce daily spot buying and selling rates for the dollar.

In the first part of the year, a spread of 1 per cent was

maintained between the buying and selling rates. In

pursuance of the policies to make the exchange rate more

market determined, this spread was increased to 2 per cent

with effect from 20 March 1995, in order to provide a

greater flexibility to commercial banks in determining their

rates for transactions. As a consequence of the reduced

inflow of foreign funds into the country, purchases of dollars

by the Central Bank fell from US dollars 652 million in

1994 to US dollars 202 million in 1995. There were no sales

of US dollars from the Central Bank to commercial banks

in 1995. In 1994, such sales had amounted to US dollars

72 million.

The assetsfliabilities of Foreign Currency Banking Units

(FCBUs) rose by 13 per cent in 1995 following the 15 per

cent increase in 1994. Total assets/liabilities rose from US

dollars 1,304 million at end 1994 to US dollars 1,476 million

at end 1995. On the liabilities side, the lower rate of growth

was primarily due to the slower growth in the deposits of

non-residents, which rose only by 3 per cent (from US

dollars 665 million to US dollars 682 million), in contrast

to an increase of 11 per cent in 1994. The factors which

affected foreign investment in the share market also had a

similar impact on the placement of foreign deposits with

FCBUs.

applicable on loans to residents was encouraging a shift in

investments, horns to BOI enterprises increased by 23 per

while loans to other approved residents decreased by 17 per

Bank of Ceylon made an issue of US dollars 12 million

worth of Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) in international capital

markets, which was fully subscribed. The funds thus received

were to be used to reduce the mismatch in the maturity in

their FCBU portfolio.

10.12 Capital Market

Activities in the Colombo stock market in 1995 were

characterised by general sluggishness and a bearish

sentiment. Investors, both domestic and foreign, tended to

avoid making major investments. The market decline, which

began in late 1994, was further aggravated in early 1995 by

labour unrest and by the breakdown in the peace talks. Share

prices continued to fall, although a brief rally was seen

around June and July. The All Share Price Index declined

by 33 per cent during the year, while the Sensitive Price

Index declined by 31 per cent. Foreign participation, usually

the cause of a boom in the stock market, was low.

Non-nationals were net sellers in the market during the first

five months of the year, though significantly, they become

net purchasers thereafter, indicating a resurgence in foreign

investor confidence in the Colombo stock market. In

December however, a reversal occurred once again, and for

the year as a whole, non-nationals were net sellers. Primary

issues in the market were not very successful, with only one

of the 14 new public issues opened in 1995 being fully

subscribed by the public. The Government indicated its

continued commitment to the privatisation process by placing

the shares of six plantation companies for sale in the market.

Primary Market

In 1995, the number of new primary issues opened for subscription remained high, partly due to seven issues being offered under the privatisation programme. However, the number of rights issues fell sharply and the total funds raised in the capital market declined from Rs. 11,331 million in 1994 to Rs. 4,038 million in 1995. Fourteen primary issues were opened to the public for subscription in 1995, all these being initial public offerings (IPO). Six of these were plantation companies being offered for sale by the Government as a part of its ongoing privatisation programme. In comparison, 21 new issues were opened for subscription in 1994. In addition, the Government also offered for sale, on an 'all or nothing! basis, blocks of 51 per cent of the shares in three other plantation management companies. These were taken up by the present managing companies. Of the 14 new primary issues, 13 were undersubscribed. Underwriters to these issues had to take up over 80 per cent

of the total shares offered, at an approximate cost of

Rs. 1,457 million. Public investment in the plantation

companies was low with only an average of 10 per cent of

the offers being subscribed. The total value of the market

offer of the 14 companies (inclusive of share premium) was

Rs.1,814 million. In comparison, 1994 saw a total market

offer of Rs.4,587 million.

A significant decline was also experienced in the funds

obtained by companies through rights issues. In comparison

to Rs.7,800 million raised through 29 rights issues in 1994,

only Rs.1,166 million was raised through 15 rights issues in

1995.

Secondary Market

Continuing the trend which began in 1994, share price

indices fell in the current year too, reflecting the impact of

a market correction, high interest rates and weakened

non-national participation. From December 1994 to end May

1995, the All Share Price Index (ASPI) fell from 986.7 to

693.8 (a 30 per cent reduction), while the Sensitive Price

Index (SPI) fell from 1438.8 to 988.4 (a 31 per cent

reduction). Share prices increased briefly in June and July,

but declined once more thereafter. By end December 1995,

the All Share Price Index had dropped to 663.7 (a fall of

33 per cent for the year), while the Sensitive Price Index

dropped to 990.5 (a fall of 31 per cent for the year). With

the fall in share prices, market capitalisation also declined

from Rs.143.2 billion at the end of 1994 to Rs.106.9 billion

at end 1995.

The level of activity in the market was very low. Daily

turnover declined from an average of Rs.148 million in 1994

to Rs.47 million in 1995 (a decline of 68 per cent) while

the total number of shares transacted fell from 506 million

to 320 million (a fall of 37 per cent). The fall in investment

activities of domestic investors was more pronounced than

of non-national investors. Domestic investors, who accounted

for 60 per cent of the turnover in 1994, reduced their

activities by 78 per cent and accounted only for 41 per cent

of the turnover in 1995. Non-national turnover fell by 52 per

cent. Purchases by non-nationals declined from Rs. 14,473

million in 1994 to Rs.5,389 million in 1995, while sales fell

from Rs.13,139 million to Rs.5,479 million in 1995. For the

year as a whole, non-nationals were net sellers to the extent

of Rs.90 million, in contrast to the last three years when they

were large net buyers. The lack of foreign interest in the

Colombo stock market was attributed mainly to the labour

unrest in the latter part of 1994 and early part of 1995 and

the breakdown of the peace negotiations. In addition, high

interest rates in the United States and the cautious attitude

of many Western investors to investment in emerging

markets following the Mexican crisis in 1994 led to

investments being focussed on markets in the established

financial centres.

Unit Trusts

As in 1994, four Unit Trusts (UTs) operated in 1995.

Reflecting the decline in the share market, the combined net

asset value (NAV) of these four UTs declined from Rs.3,947

million at end 1994 to Rs.2,889 million in 1995, a decline

of 26.8 per cent. In contrast, the NAV of the UTs increased

by 10.7 per cent in 1994. The average investment in equities

by the UTs declined from 64 per cent of their total net asset

value in 1994, to 61.4 per cent in 1995. This overall shift

in the structure of their portfolios in part enabled the UTs

as a group to limit the decline in their NAV to 26.8 per cent,

in comparison to a fall of 32.7 per cent in the All Share

Price Index of the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1995.

10.13 Financial Sector Reforms

Important legislative amendments were introduced in

1995 as a part of the ongoing process of developing the

financial market. The Credit Information Bureau (CIB) Act,

the Banking Act, the National Savings Bank (NSB) Act, the

Monetary Law Act (MLA), the Registered Stocks and

Securities Ordinance (RSSO) and the Local Treasury Bills

Ordinance (LTBO) were all amended.

The CIB Act was amended to permit merchant banks

and other institutions engaged in leasing activities to have

access to the Credit Information Bureau. Amendments to the

NSB Act were designed to restructure the capital base of the

NSB and permit its operations to be more market-oriented.

With a view to improving the regulatory framework and thus

the stability of the financial system, the Banking Act was

amended to bring the NSB, the DFCC, the NDB and the

SMIB under the regular supervision of the Central Bank and

to permit closer Central Bank supervision of prudential

guidelines for Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUS) of

commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka.

Amendments were introduced to the MLA, the RSSO and the LTBO to promote the establishment of a scripless government securities trading system in Sri Lanka, which would be beneficial in the expansion of the primary market and the development of an active secondary market in government securities. Provision was also made through these amendments for the issue of a new type of scripless government security transferable by endorsement, viz. Treasury Bonds, which would have a maturity of over one year and would carry a coupon rate of interest, in addition to being sold at an auction.
