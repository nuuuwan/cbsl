Under BOT policies, a private entrepreneur agrees to finance, construct, operate and maintain the facility for a specified period and then transfer the facility to the Government, whereas under BOO schemes the facility will be owned by the private entrepreneur. The process of private sector participation in the provision of infrastructural services is making slow but steady progress at present. As the decisive political commitment to the process has already been assured, it is likely to progress faster once there is a general improvement in the investment climate, particularly the security situation.",

In 1995, some universities were able to admit two batches of students and this cleared the backlog to a certain extent. However, this process was constrained by the limited availability of academic staff and physical facilities. The situation was further aggravated by the closure of universities from time to time during 1995 due to student problems and trade union action of staff.",

Sales to the industrial and commercial sectors rose by 8 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, reflecting expanding economic activities. Sales by LECO expanded by 13 per cent largely due to increased sales to the domestic sector. The total number of consumers catered to by LECO grew by 7 per cent to 254,000 in 1995.",

Of the total investment in major projects, more than 60 per cent was spent on development and improvement of the power distribution and transmission network. The main projects implemented during the year were the Transmission System Augmentation and Development Project (Rs.670 million) and the Transmission and Grid Substation Development Project ( Rs.270 million) funded by the OECF and the Power Distribution and Transmission Project (Rs.197 million) and the Second Power Distribution and Transmission Project (Rs.178 million) funded by the IDA. ADB funds amounting to Rs.406 million were disbursed for rural electrification. A sum of Rs.298 million was spent under the Diesel Extension Project at Sapugaskanda (40 MW.), the major addition to the power grid after Samanalawewa. As in the previous year, the CEB has recorded a high under expenditure ratio (46 per cent of total planned investment) in 1995. According to the CEB sources, the main reasons for the under expenditure were the delays in awarding tenders, unsatisfactory performance of contractors and delays in the acquisition of necessary lands.",

The quality of services provided by the private passenger transport sector continued to be unsatisfactory due to a lack of enforcement of regulations and lack of investment to improve the quality of service. Similarly, the viability of the public sector passenger transport sector was also threatened by continuous financial losses. In order to provide a safe, efficient and reliable service, the commercial viability of the sector needs to be restored by various means including appropriate revisions to bus fares.",

Under the bridge rehabilitation programme, initial steps were taken to rehabilitate the Kalutara and Panadura railway bridges. Permanent measures were taken to overcome the Watawala subsidence and thus eliminate interruptions to normal services. In addition, rail tracks were improved by laying 173,251 concrete and wooden sleepers, thereby removing a number of speed restrictions. With a view to improving services on the Kelani Valley line, the project of broad gauging the tracks from Padukka to Avissawella progressed during the year.",
