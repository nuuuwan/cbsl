REVERSE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS IN TREASURY BILLS BY THE CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA (CBSL) OPERATING PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES

Operating Procedures & Guidelines -

Operating procedures and guidelines applicable to the Reverse Repurchase Transactions in Treasury Bills

price (purchase price) with an agreement to sell back on an agreed date (sell back date) at an agreed price

(sell back price).

(3) The tenure of a Reverse Repurchase Transaction will be one day only, i.e. the sell back date shall be the day

after the purchase date.

(4) The CBSL will determine daily whether it would engage in Reverse Repurchase Transactions in Treasury

Bills on that day and will announce the quantum, if any, of Treasury Bills it will purchase from CBPDs on a

Reverse Repurchase basis on that day and will invite quotations from CBPDs.

their quotations by facsimile or by telephone by 11.15 a.m. on that day.

(10) The acceptance by the CBSL of the quotation of a CBPD in full or in part will be binding on the CBPD and

the failure of a CBPD to endorse and deliver the Treasury Bill/s accepted by the CBSL and or to sign and

deliver the Reverse Repurchase Agreement in respect of such Treasury Bill/s will render the CBPD liable to

pay damages on the value of Treasury Bill/s accepted by the CBSL at the maximum interest rate in the call

money market on the date of quotation. The CBSL may also prohibit the CBPD to participate in Reverse

Repurchase Transactions with the CBSL in the future or for any given period.

Where delivery of the Agreement is made as required hereunder by facsimile, a duly executed Agreement will be delivered by hand to the CBSL by the CBPD before the close of business on the same day.

(14) The account of the CBPD with the CBSL will be credited with the purchase value of the Treasury Bill/s on

receipt by the CBSL of both the duly endorsed Treasury Bill/s and the Agreement duly executed by the

CBPD.

(15) The purchase price of a Treasury Bill/s accepted by the CBSL will be calculated by discounting the

Treasury Bill/s for the number of days to its maturity at the relevant current Primary Market Weighted

Average Yield Rate (PMWAYR) for Treasury Bills adjusted by a margin which will be decided by the

Open Market Operations Committee of the CBSL.

(16) On the sell back date stipulated in the Agreement referred to above the account of the CBPD with the CBSL

will be debited with the sell back value which consists of the purchase value plus the interest component

which will be calculated at the rate quoted by the CBPD and accepted by CBSL.

(17) Subject to the contents of paragraph (19), the CBSL shall endorse the Treasury Bill/s in favour of the CBPD

on termination of the Reverse Repurchase Agreement, i.e. on the debiting of the CBPD account and the

crediting of the CBSL account with the sell back value on the sell back date. Such Treasury Bill/s may be

collected by the CBPD from the CBSL during business hours subsequent to such termination.

(18) If the sell back date for any Reverse Repurchase Transaction is a bank holiday, any obligation of a party to a

Reverse Repurchase Agreement arising on such day will be carried out by such party on the immediately

succeeding business day. The procedures and guidelines set out herein and in the Reverse Repurchase

Agreement executed in respect of any Reverse Repurchase Transaction shall be binding on the CBPD.

(19) (a) Notwithstanding the contents of paragraphs (11), CBPDs may utilise any Treasury Bill/s kept in the

custody of CBSL and endorsed in favour of CBSL for Reverse Repurchase Transactions with the CBSL

in which event it shall not be necessary for the CBPD to endorse and deliver such Treasury Bill/s as

required by paragraph (11) of the Treasury Bill/s at the time of the acceptance by the CBSL of its

quotation for such Treasury Bill/s.

(b) Notwithstanding the contents of paragraph (17), a CBPD may keep in the custody of the CBSL the Treasury Bill/s forming the subject matter of a Reverse Repurchase Agreement subsequent to the termination of such transaction and in such event the CBSL shall retain in its custody such Treasury Bill/s without endorsing them in favour of the CBPD.
