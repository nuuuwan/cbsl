    "text": "When compared with the performance in the recent past, 1995 registered a significant recovery in the industrial sector growth momentum, from the dip in 1994 which occurred mainly as a result of election related uncertainties and labour unrest following the change of government. This favourable growth is a reflection of strong domestic demand arising from the growth in private business activities and increased foreign demand following economic recovery in the major industrial countries. The relatively high depreciation of the rupee in 1995 also helped the industrial sector. Nevertheless, the industrial sector continued to experience difficulties in 1995 due to continuing labour unrest, increased pressure for higher wages, high financing costs, infrastructural constraints and a sharp reduction in foreign capital inflows. The enterprises resorted to increased bank credit in an environment where the stock market remained depressed partly due to a drop in foreign capital inflows.",

    "text": "The production trends in BOI industries are estimated on the basis of export performance. In addition to the favourable foreign demand, the increased number of investment approvals in the last few years under Section 17 of the BOI Law for export oriented industries and expansion of capacity in existing industries contributed to the improved performance of this sector. The output of BOI industries in real terms is estimated to have increased by 16 per cent in 1995 over the levels in 1994. Gross export earnings of BOI enterprises, including the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme, grew by 28 per cent from Rs. 88 billion (SDR 1,244 million) in 1994 to Rs.113 billion (SDR 1,453 million) in 1995. Industrial sub-sectors under the BOI that recorded increases were food, beverages and tobacco (23 per cent), textiles, wearing apparel and leather products (13 per cent), wood and wood products (65 per cent), chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products (40 per cent), non-metallic mineral products (24 per cent), fabricated metal products (85 per cent) and manufactured products not elsewhere specified (27 per cent).",

In this regard, the import duty on several items was reduced from higher tariff bands in 1994 to lower bands in 1995. The Government is moving towards a uniform 15 per cent import tariff rate by 1998. Further, in order to avoid multi-point taxation in respect of turnover at different stages of the production process by different firms, a Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is computed on the basis of the value addition, has been proposed.",
