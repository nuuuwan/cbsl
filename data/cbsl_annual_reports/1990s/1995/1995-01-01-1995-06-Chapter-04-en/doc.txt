4. INDUSTRY

4.1 Overall Trends

Industrial output grew by 10.2 per cent in 1995 and helped the manufacturing sector to takeover, for the first time, the predominant position held by the agricultural sector in the economy. The growth in the industrial sector in 1995 was supported by substantial increases in both export-oriented and domestic market-oriented industries. Factory industries, which accounted for 82 per cent of the total manufacturing output, contributed to 28 percent of the economic growth in 1995.

When compared with the performance in the recent past, 1995 registered a significant recovery in the industrial sector growth momentum, from the dip in 1994 which occurred mainly as a result of election related uncertainties and labour unrest following the change of government. This favourable growth is a reflection of strong domestic demand arising from the growth in private business activities and increased foreign demand following economic recovery in the major industrial countries. The relatively high depreciation of the rupee in 1995 also helped the industrial sector. Nevertheless, the industrial sector continued to experience difficulties in 1995 due to continuing labour unrest, increased pressure for higher wages, high financing costs, infrastructural constraints and a sharp reduction in foreign capital inflows. The enterprises resorted to increased bank credit in an environment where the stock market remained depressed partly due to a drop in foreign capital inflows.

4.2 Production

On the basis of the Annual Survey of Industrial

Production covering 350 non-BOI enterprises, industrial

production of public sector enterprises and estimates based

on export data for BOI enterprises, industrial output is

estimated to have grown by 10.2 per cent in 1995. Total

industrial output at current prices increased by 16.1 percent,

thus yielding an implicit price deflator of 5.3 per cent for

factory industries.

The impetus for the growth in industrial output in 1995

came from two major industrial categories, namely, the

textiles, wearing apparel and leather products category and

the food, beverages and tobacco category. These two

categories contributed to 87 per cent of the growth in

-industrial output.

As in the previous year, the growth of the industrial

sector in 1995 came entirely from the private sector. Private

sector industrial production grew by 12 per cent as compared

with an 11 per cent growth in 1994 and accounted for 91

per cent of the total industrial value added in 1995. The

private sector has come to the forefront of industrial

activities, as the importance of the public sector has

diminished with the emergence of a dynamic entrepreneurial

class and the gradual privatisation of state owned enterprises.

Textiles, Wearing Apparel and Leather Products

The output of textiles, wearing apparel and leather products grew in real terms by 14.8 per cent in 1995 and contributed to 53 per cent of the industrial output growth. This category accounted for 47 per cent of the total industrial production. Despite an increase in the quota limits by about 9 per cent in the case of USA quotas in 1995, increased exports were mainly in non-quota garments. Total textiles and wearing apparel exports to the USA increased by 21 per cent. Apparel exports under quota rose by 6 per cent, while exports of non-quota apparel rose by 23 per cent. Similarly, exports of non-apparel under quota increased by 19 per cent while exports of non-apparel under non-quota increased by 81 per cent. In the case of the EEC, the ratio of quota limits was raised by 7 per cent and the quota utilisation rose by 11 per cent. Total exports of textiles and garments in rupee terms rose by 24 per cent in 1995. It is also noteworthy that Sri Lankan apparel exporters were able to establish a

foothold in highly competitive Japanese and Korean markets which are completely free of quotas. Overall, the share of non-quota items rose from 43 per cent in 1994 to 50 per cent in 1995.

According to the Ministry of Industrial Development and the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), 629 garment factories were in operation at end 1995 including those coming under the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme. These factories provided 232,000 direct employment opportunities. Under the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme 160 enterprises were in commercial operation, providing employment opportunities to about 76,903 persons. Export earnings from these enterprises amounted to Rs. 32.9 billion in 1995.

With the establishment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in January 1995, all existing bilateral textile agreements that came under the Multi-Fibre Arrangements (MFA) were telescoped into the Uruguay Round Agreement

on Textile and Clothing (ATC). The ATC has developed a

framework for the full integration of textiles and apparel into

the multilateral trading system and to phase out quotas over

a ten year period aimed at creating a completely free trade

in textiles and clothing by the year 2005. Therefore, it is of

paramount importance that Sri Lanka be prepared to face

stiff competition following the complete abolition of quotas

in the future.

The export oriented textile manufacturing industries

which have a secured export market registered a significant

growth in 1995. During the year, a number of export

oriented textile manufacturing industries expanded their

production capacity and modernised their factories to cope

with increasing demand for yarn and gray and finished cloth,

particularly from the EEC and Middle Eastern countries.

Meanwhile, some textile manufacturers who cater to the

local market experienced a setback due to marketing

problems. These problems were partly due to the inflow of

smuggled textiles to the local market. In the past this sector

operated under heavy protection. However, the recent

reduction of tariffs has adversely affected their

competitiveness. Labour disputes in major factories were also

responsible for the sluggishness of the industry. The local

textile industry need to invest in modern technology and

become more dynamic to be cost effective and competitive

in the current context. Meanwhile, enhanced surveillance at

the ports through speedy implementation of the proposed pre-

shipment inspection scheme would help the local textile

industry while enhancing Customs revenues for the

Government.

The leather products sector also reported a 17 per cent growth rate in 1995. However, the footwear sub-sector reported a 7 per cent decline.

Food, Beverages and Tobacco

In response to increased domestic consumer demand, the

food, beverages and tobacco sub-sector continued to expand

during the year under review. This industrial category

expanded in real terms by 10.5 per cent and contributed to

26 per cent of the growth in industrial output. Significant

increases in output were shown in processed tobacco, leaf

tobacco and beverages such as CTC teas and tea bags,

wheat flour, dairy products, biscuits and meat products. The ; increased domestic demand for wheat flour based products,

mainly owing to the wheat flour subsidy, contributed to this

improved performance, but as mentioned elsewhere, at the

expense of the agricultural sector. The output of tobacco

products, which registered a marginal decline in the previous

year owing to labour disputes, recovered in 1995. The

cigarette manufacturing industry had to compete with

smuggled cigarettes, particularly during the latter part of the

year. The production of poultry feed, which recorded a

decline in the previous year due to labour unrest, also

reported a moderate growth, with uninterrupted production

during the year. The domestic beer industry reached the

limits of its production capacity towards end 1995 as a result

of increased demand following the reduction of excise duties

on beer in November 1995.

Chemical, Petroleum, Rubber and Plastic Products

The output of the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products category grew by 6.6 per cent in 1995 as compared with an 9.1 per cent growth in the previous year. The drop in the growth rate was attributed to the temporary closure of the petroleum refinery for maintenance. Rubber products such as tyres, tubes, rubber gloves, poly bags, rubber bags, foam rubber matteresses, pvc pouches and pvc

rainwear increased significantly, boosted by buoyant demand

from the major importing countries, particularly those in the

EEC and the Middle East. The output of soap and toiletries,

pharmaceuticals, agro-chemicals, and plastic products

registered a notable growth as a result of strong local

demand induced by the price advantage over imported items

and the improved quality of locally produced items.

Other Industrial Products

The increased export demand for dolomite products,

porcelain figurines and granite slabs helped the non-metallic

mineral products category to achieve a 7.5 per cent growth

in 1995. Despite labour disputes in some firms, the cut and

polished diamond industry also realised a growth rate of 4

per cent in 1995. The manufacture of glass and glass

products and asbestos also achieved a significant growth.

This favourable performance was largely attributed to the

growing local demand for these items, arising from the

construction industry. Despite the increased demand, cement

production reported a marginal decline due to delays in the

availability of imported inputs for Ruhunu Cement Co. Ltd.

The output of ceramic products, which declined in 1994 due

to labour unrest, recovered marginally in 1995.

The paper and paper products category registered a drop

in output of 1.6 per cent. This decline was due to a drop in

the output of the National Paper Company by 10 per cent.

However, the printing and manufacture of paper and paper

products and labels by the non-BOI private sector rose by

14 per cent during the year. This was mainly due to

increased domestic demand arising from the growing

manufacturing and services sectors.

The output of fabricated metal products showed a marginal improvement of 3.5 per cent. In this category higher output growth rates were reported in the manufacture of fabricated metal products, batteries, bulbs, cables and agricultural machinery. The output of the industries engaged in the fabrication of coachwork of buses and lorries that reported a high, growth in the previous year, showed a further expansion in 1995 due to increased local demand.

Among the other industries, moderate output growth rates were reported in coir fibre products, fishing gear and nylon nets. The soft toys industry improved mainly due to higher export demand.

The production trends in BOI industries are estimated on the basis of export performance. In addition to the favourable foreign demand, the increased number of investment approvals in the last few years under Section 17 of the BOI Law for export oriented industries and expansion of capacity in existing industries contributed to the improved performance of this sector. The output of BOI industries in real terms is estimated to have increased by 16 per cent in 1995 over the levels in 1994. Gross export earnings of BOI enterprises, including the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme, grew by 28 per cent from Rs. 88 billion (SDR 1,244 million) in 1994 to Rs.113 billion (SDR 1,453 million) in 1995. Industrial sub-sectors under the BOI that recorded increases were food, beverages and tobacco (23 per cent), textiles, wearing apparel and leather products (13 per cent), wood and wood products (65 per cent), chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products (40 per cent), non-metallic mineral products (24 per cent), fabricated metal products (85 per cent) and manufactured products not elsewhere specified (27 per cent).

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

Public sector industrial output, in real terms, declined by 9 per cent in 1995 when compared with a 5 per cent decline in 1994. This was mainly due to a significant drop in production (8 per cent) of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, which accounted for 85 per cent of the total public sector industrial output, owing to the closure of the refinery for routine maintenance purposes in early 1995. Public sector industrial output, excluding petroleum also declined by 13 per cent.

Public sector enterprises that recorded increases in output in 1995 were Lanka Salt Ltd. (78 per cent), State Timber Corporation (20 per cent), Lanka Phosphate Ltd. (12 per cent), Sri Lanka Rubber Manufacturing and Export Corporation Ltd. (10 per cent) and Sevanagala Sugar Industries Ltd. (1 per cent).

Favourable weather conditions that prevailed during the

year and the use of new machines and pumps were the main

factors that contributed to the increased output of Lanka Salt

Ltd. The higher level of production following increased

demand for centrifuged latex was the major reason for the

increase in production of the Sri Lanka Rubber

Manufacturing and Export Corporation Ltd.

Public sector industrial enterprises that recorded

decreases in output during the year were Ceylon Steel

Corporation Ltd. (27 per cent), Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd.

(19 per cent), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (8 per cent) and

National Paper Company Ltd. (10 per cent).

An inadequate supply of raw materials, labour disputes

and the closure of the factory for maintenance purposes

resulted in a decline in the output of the Ceylon Steel

Corporation Ltd. A shortage of raw material due to a

reduced level of raw material extraction was responsible for

the decline in output of Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd. The

decrease in output of the National Paper Company Ltd. was

largely due to a shortage of raw materials and interruption

to the power supply at the Valachchenai factory.

In terms of the sectoral classification of public sector enterprises, the wood and wood products and food, beverages and tobacco categories recorded output increases of 21 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. The industrial categories that recorded decreases in output were basic metal products (27 per cent), paper and paper products (10 per cent), chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products (8 per cent) and non-metallic mineral products (2 per cent).

4.3 Value Added

In nominal terms, the value added in industry increased by 17 per cent in 1995 compared with a 15 per cent growth

in the previous year as a result of an increase in the ex-

factory value. In real terms the growth of value added was

10 per cent.

Total value added in manufacturing industry in 1995

amounted to Rs. 82 billion. As a percentage of the value of

industrial production, the value added ratio was 37 per cent

in 1995, similar to the level that prevailed in 1994. The

industrial categories with value added ratios above 50 per

cent were wood and wood products (67 per cent), non-

metallic mineral products (65 per cent), fabricated metal

products (61 per cent), paper and paper products (57 per cent) and food, beverages and tobacco (54 per cent). The value added ratios were below 50 per cent in the industrial categories of manufactured products not elsewhere specified (42 per cent), textiles, wearing apparel and leather products (26 per cent), basic metal products (17 per cent) and chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products (16 per cent). • • . .

4.4 Credit and Other Inputs

Credit

The industrial sector continued to receive medium and

long term credit under the Small and Medium Scale

Industries Credit Scheme (SMI) channeled through the

National Development Bank (NDB) and co-funded by

assistance from the IDA and ADB. It was the major

financing programme under which industries received

financial assistance in 1995. In addition, the Development

Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC), the NDB and

Industrial credit extended and equity participation by the

DFCC, which reported a marginal decline in 1994, increased

significantly in 1995. The DFCC approved 480 projects in

1995 with a credit outlay of Rs.3,424 million, as compared

with 311 projects with an outlay of Rs.2,501 million in 1994.

The industrial categories that received major shares of these

facilities were food, beverages and tobacco, chemical,

petroleum, rubber and plastic products and fabricated metal

products.

During 1995, commercial banks too continued to

provide financial facilities. Commercial bank advances to the

industrial sector during the first nine months of the year

increased by 25 per cent from Rs.19.5 billion at end

Raw Materials

The total cost of raw materials used in the

manufacturing sector in nominal terms rose by 13 per cent,

from Rs:109 billion in 1994 to Rs. 123 billion in 1995. The

largest cost increases were reported in the industrial

categories of wood and wood products and manufactured

products not elsewhere specified. The raw material

component of the value of industrial production varied from

18 per cent in the non-metallic mineral products category to

80 per cent in the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic

products category. The raw material component in the

textiles, wearing apparel and leather products category was

67 per cent. The cost of raw materials amounted to 55 per

cent of the total value of industrial production in 1995.

Increases in raw material costs of private sector industries

in 1995 was largely evident in respect of manufactured

rubber products due to marked increases in international

prices of natural rubber, synthetic rubber and nylon.

The cost of power and fuel used in the industrial sector increased by 17 per cent in nominal terms as compared with the previous year. The share of energy (electricity, fuel and other) in the cost of industrial output in 1995 was 6 per cent. Energy formed a principal element in the total cost of production of non-metallic mineral products, while it had the lowest share in chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products.

4.5 Investment

Foreign Investment

Foreign capital flows have played an important role in the economic growth of Sri Lanka by bridging the gap between domestic savings and investment, and providing the impetus for economic growth. Over the last few years, Sri Lanka has been able to attract substantial foreign capital mainly from Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany, Australia, Italy, India and the USA, despite competition from other developing countries..

The BOI, which is the main institution responsible for

promoting foreign investment in Sri Lanka, functioned as a

'one stop investment promotion centre', facilitating the flow

of foreign investment into the country. A highlight of BOI

promotional activities in 1995 was the investment forum held

in Colombo. This helped to facilitate one-to-one business

meetings on prepared project proposals for joint ventures and

technical co-operation in the fields of agri-materials, textiles,

leather, rubber, ceramics, electronics and information

technology.

There has been a setback in the number of projects and

volume of investment approved by the BOI in 1995. Under

Section 17, the BOI approved 224 projects with an investment commitment of Rs.32 billion, as compared with 291 projects with investment commitments of Rs.43 billion approved in 1994, bringing the total number of projects approved to 1,773 by end 1995. During 1995, Sri Lanka attracted several established international companies to invest in the country, bringing with them the potential of large future investments. The foreign component of approved investment in 1995 was Rs.14 billion or 43 per cent of total approved investment during the year. Of the total approved projects upto end 1995, agreements had been signed in respect of 1,132 projects with the BOI. Among these, 756 enterprises, including 150 projects in the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme, had invested Rs. 77 billion by end 1995. The foreign component of this investment was Rs. 52 billion or 68 per cent of the total investment. The major

industrial categories that absorbed these investments were textiles, wearing apparel and leather products, chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products and manufactured products not elsewhere specified.

Under the Inland Revenue and Tax Related Laws (General Incentive Scheme), the BOI approved 62 projects in 1995. The total envisaged investment in these projects amounted to Rs. 3.2 billion, of which the foreign component was Rs.1.5 billion or 46 per cent.

Despite the reduction in new approvals in foreign

investment in the BOI, employment in BOI enterprises

including the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme

increased by 13 per cent during 1995 compared to 10 per

industries and increased production levels contributed to the rise in employment.

Local Investment

There was a substantial volume of local investment in

projects approved by the BOI. The share of local investment

in 756 projects operated under the BOI amounted to Rs.25

billion or 32 per cent of the total investment at end 1995.

These investments were mainly in the production of soft

toys, yarn and gray cloth, wooden handicrafts, processing of

fruits and vegetables, kitchen utensils, telecommunication

equipment and garment accessories. Of the Rs.32 billion

investment commitment in 1995, Rs.18 billion or 57 per cent

is expected to be generated from local sources. Furthermore,

in BOI projects under the General Incentive Scheme, the

local investment component accounted for Rs.1.7 billion or

54 per cent of the total investment.

Meanwhile, total investment in 1,578 enterprises which were registered under the Ministry of Industrial Development at end December 1995, amounted to Rs. 81.1 billion. The main categories that absorbed these investments were chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products, textiles, wearing apparel and leather products and food, beverages and tobacco. These enterprises have generated employment for 300,036 persons.

4.6 Industrial Location

The distribution of industrial location shows that

industrial development has been concentrated in a few

districts. Therefore, recent government policy has emphasised

regional industrialisation. The main objectives of regional

industrialisation are to bring economic development to the

regions, reduce congestion in major industrial areas,

discourage migration to the centre and increase employment

opportunities for the rural unemployed.

Among industries registered under the Ministry of

Industrial Development, 77 per cent or 1,211 enterprises were

located in the Colombo district while 11 per cent or 171

enterprises were in the Gampaha district.

By the end of 1995, out of the 534 industries that were

in commercial operation under Section 17 of the BOI Law,

35 per cent or 187 enterprises were located in the Colombo

district and 45 per cent or 239 enterprises in the Gampaha

district mainly due to the availability of improved

infrastructure facilities in the Biyagama and Katunayake

Investment Promotion Zones.

Out of 333 enterprises that were in commercial

operation by end 1995 under Section 16 of the BOI Law,

193 or 58 per cent were located in the Colombo district,

while 22 per cent or 73 were located in the Gampaha district

mainly due to infrastructural considerations. A notable

feature of the BOI enterprises under Section 16 was the

location of some enterprises in less developed areas such as

Moneragala, Trincomalee, Hambantota and Matara.

Under the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme,

160 garment factories were in operation in 21 districts by

end 1995. Of these, 86 per cent or 137 garment factories

were located outside the Colombo and Gampaha districts.

The number of garment factories that were in operation in

less developed areas such as Anuradhapura, Ratnapura,

Puttalam and Kurunegala were 14, 14, 12 and 11

respectively.

The industrial estate development programme was

launched in 1995 towards promoting industrial activities in

rural areas and minimising the pressures and problems

associated with environmental pollution, health, etc. due to

the excessive concentration of industries in a few locations.

This programme includes two international standard industrial

estates in Seethawaka and Katana. The initial work with

regard to these two industrial estates commenced in 1995

with assistance from the Japanese government. In addition,

21 regional industrial estate sites have been identified and

initial development work was undertaken by the private

sector in 1995. The number of proposed industrial estates

located in the Anuradhapura, Puttalam, Moneragala, Badulla

and Hambantota districts were 4, 4, 2, 2 and 2 respectively.

4.7 Industrial Policy

The main objective of the industrial policy of the Government announced in 1994 was to achieve sustainable industrial growth through market orientation, increased efficiency, stimulation of foreign and local investment and industrial diversification. The Government expects to achieve macroecomomic stability to provide a sound basis for sustainable industrial development. Within this framework, foreign investment is to be encouraged to make a vital contribution to the process by providing capital and continuous access to new technology and export markets.

Since several manufacturing enterprises in the domestic sector have developed and operated behind tariff and non-tariff barriers, the Government has taken steps through trade liberalisation and tariff reform to increase the efficiency of these firms and bring them into the mainstream of industrial growth as the country moves towards lower levels of protection. In this regard, the import duty on several items was reduced from higher tariff bands in 1994 to lower bands in 1995. The Government is moving towards a uniform 15 per cent import tariff rate by 1998. Further, in order to avoid multi-point taxation in respect of turnover at different stages of the production process by different firms, a Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is computed on the basis of the value addition, has been proposed.

Recognising the importance of providing basic

infrastructure facilities for industrial development, the

Government has taken several positive steps to develop this

sector. In providing infrastructure facilities for industries the

Government expect to continue investing in areas such as

health, education, vocational training, environment and

rural infrastructure while the financing of power,

telecommunications, highways and water supply is to be with

private sector participation on the basis of Build, Operate and

Own (BOO) or Build/Operate and Transfer (BOT)

arrangements. The Secretariat for Infrastructure Development

and Investment (SIDI), which was merged with the BOI in

September 1995 to strengthen the BOI's role as a single

47

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

service centre in promoting infrastructure projects, is expected to handle large projects in power, communications, transportation, ports, water supply and drainage, waste disposal, construction of shopping complexes and establishment of industrial estates, while encouraging BOO and BOT arrangements. In this regard, consideration will be given to the setting up of an Infrastructure Development Fund.

In the field of technology improvement and skills development, the Ministry of Science and Technology has initiated action through the Human Resources Development Council to rectify the shortcomings of technology and skills development among research scientists, engineers, technicians, etc. Further, the Government in the 1996 Budget announced a package of incentives consisting of attractive tax and import duty concessions to investors who would utilise advanced technology towards diversification into a range of higher value added high-technology industries. Under this enhanced incentive scheme, a five year tax holiday was granted to new companies in the manufacturing and services sectors utilising new technology and investing a minimum of Rs.10 million in productive capital and employing more than 50 employees. The same package for

encouraging advanced technology was extended to existing

companies in the manufacturing and services sectors on the

basis of their incremental profits adjusted annually for

inflation. Duty free imports and corresponding turnover tax

exemption will be granted to new companies investing over

Rs.10 million in equipment. Similar incentives were given

to existing companies investing over Rs.2.5 million in

machinery and equipment. In addition to the existing

concessions, a five year tax holiday was granted to BOI

export oriented companies which utilise advanced technology

and invest at least Rs.50 million in machinery and equipment

and employ more than 50 persons. Large scale development

projects were given a 10 to 20 year tax holiday period

depending on the amount of investment and the employment

generated.

With a view to providing more flexibility to BOI

enterprises and promoting Sri Lanka as a popular

international shopping centre and discouraging the smuggling

of textiles and clothing into the country, in January 1995,

the Government decided to permit 10 per cent of the output

of garment industries operating under the BOI to be released

to the domestic market.
