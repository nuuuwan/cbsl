The potato harvest increased by 44 per cent to 101,600 metric tons and was one of the best in the recent past. Both an improvement in the yield and an increase in the extent cultivated contributed towards this increased production. The potato yield during the year increased significantly by 36 per cent to 11,250 metric tons per hectare compared to 8,300 metric tons per hectare achieved in 1994. The significant improvement in the potato yield and extents cultivated could be attributed to the availability of large stocks of good quality imported seed potato, favourable weather conditions and the extension of cultivation into non-traditional areas. Sesame production recorded a 74 per cent increase to 6,100 metric tons",

Problems faced by big onion growers, especially in marketing their produce after the bumper crop in 1994, discouraged the cultivation of this crop in the subsequent year. The extent under big onion dropped from 7,800 hectares in 1994 to 4,400 hectares by 1995. The production of red onions, chillies and green gram recorded decreases of 18 per cent, 10 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, compared to 1994. The drop in production of these crops during 1995 was attributed to the reduced extents cultivated especially during Maha 1994/95, as the climatic conditions were more favourable for paddy cultivation.",

This was a 6 per cent increase when compared with the previous year. Both marine and aquaculture sectors contributed to this increased production. Meanwhile, the production of dry fish declined by 24 per cent in 1995. Marine fish production increased during the year, mainly on account of the addition of new boats, engines and fishing gear to the industry, as well as the cessation of hostilities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces until the latter part of April 1995. Further, the increase in the conversion of day boats to multi-day vessels also contributed to the improvement in the output. The increase in aquaculture could be attributed to better management and strengthening of the extension services in fresh water fisheries.",

However, due to the significant increase in the import price of urea and TSP, as an interim measure, a subsidy was introduced for these two ingredients for the period 1 February 1995 to 3 April 1995. The subsidy paid to the importer was at the rate of US dollars 80 per metric ton for urea and US dollars 20 per metric ton for TSP. A new fertiliser subsidy scheme was implemented with effect from 4 April 1995, where the ceiling subsidy rates payable to importers were fixed at US dollars 131 per metric ton of urea, US dollars 29 per metric ton of SA, US dollars 19 per metric ton of MOP and US dollars 59 per metric ton of TSP to maintain the market",

Under the Participatory Forestry Project (especially to raise the supply of fuel wood and general utility timber), the FD was able to involve over 51,000 families, including farmers, in planting approximately 6,900 hectares of homesteads and woodlots, while strip planting 127 kilometers by roadsides, rivers and canals. Under this project, over 4.4 million plants were raised by the FD, in collaboration with schools, non\u00adgovernmental organisations, agrarian centres and farmer organisations. The Forestry Extension Programme raised more than 1.2 million plants. The FD was able to achieve about 85 per cent of the annual target for the year under these various programmes. In addition, the FD was able to conduct awareness programmes on reforestation and forestry extension.",
