3. AGRICULTURE, FISHING AND FORESTRY

3.1 Production Trends

The performance of most agricultural crops improved in

1995, due to favourable weather conditions and attractive

prices for major export crops. It was a boom year,

particularly for rubber prices. Tea and paddy production

surpassed the record production levels of 1994, by 2 per cent

and 5 per cent, respectively. Coconut production increased

by 5 per cent and registered a record output after 1986.

There was only a marginal improvement in rubber

production, while sugar production dropped by 1 per cent.

Production trends in other agricultural crops were mixed with

certain items showing significant increases during the year.

Fish production increased by 6 per cent due to increased

deep sea and aquaculture fish production.

3.2 Agricultural Policy

The plantation sector policy became more transparent

and significant progress was made towards improving the

efficiency of the sector. In 1995, the Government

commenced the extension of the current 5 year lease

contracts for private management of the state-owned

Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs), to 53 years, with

effect from 1992. The non-plantation agriculture sector was

affected by the interplay of several factors. There was a

bumper paddy harvest which exerted downward pressure on

rice prices. This situation was aggravated by the wheat flour

subsidy which changed the relative prices against paddy

farmers. As consumer demand shifted towards cheaper wheat

flour based products, there was further downward pressure

on rice prices. This was the major justification for the

enhanced presence of the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) in

the market to purchase paddy at the guaranteed price. The

activities of the PMB interfered with the already established

private marketing system. Meanwhile, the PMB was not able

to dispose of the accumulated stock of rice and incurred a

large debt (Rs.2 billion) to the domestic banking system. In

addition, import licensing of certain agricultural products

(potatoes, big onions and chillies ) continued in 1995. Import

licensing schemes often become quantitative import controls

and a deterrent against efficient functioning of markets, with

heavy costs to the consumers. Further, a transparent variable

tariff system could provide adequate protection to fanners

while minimising costs to consumers. A transparent and

consistent policy in this area would have encouraged private

sector participation in the storage and distribution network

for these agricultural products. Meanwhile, the fertiliser

subsidy scheme re-introduced in 1994 continued in 1995 as

well but with an overall expenditure cap. However, there

were delays in the settlement of subsidy payments by the

Government to fertiliser importers due to resource

constraints.

A major structural change that took place during the

year in the agriculture sector as mentioned above was the

extension of management contract leases of nine state owned

RPCs to 53 years. The 23 RPCs were being managed by

private companies on a profit sharing basis for a 5 year

contract period. Some of the private management companies

were able to improve productivity and contain cost of

production increases. However, they were not active in long-

term investments in the plantation sector due to the short-

term nature of the contract. It was a case of management

without a reasonable period of long tenure. To improve the

efficiency of the plantation sector, under the ongoing

privatisation programme, the Government commenced

entering into long-term lease agreements with the plantation

companies whereby the land was leased for a period of 53

years with effect from 1992, while passing on the full risk

and benefit of management to the private sector.

The Public Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC)

earmarked 10 RPCs for long-leasing during the year. Fifty

one per cent of the total shares in the profit making RPCs

were to be sold to the company managing the RPC, while

51 per cent of total shares in the loss making RPCs were

to be sold on the Stock Exchange on an 'all or nothing'

basis. Twenty per cent of total shares in the company were

to be sold to the public, of which 8 per cent were reserved

for small investors at a fixed price of Rs.10 per share. The

balance 12 per cent were to be sold on a tender basis (each

tenderer being limited to a maximum of 4 per cent of the

portion). Ten per cent were to be allocated to workers of

the plantations, while the method of disposal of the balance

19 per cent had not been decided by the PERC. The

23

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

Government would hold a 'Golden Share' in each RPC to safeguard national interests and reduce trade union concerns. The capital of each RPC was valued at Rs.200 million and underwritten so as to realise the full value less its charges. Foreign ownership in the equity of a RPC was limited to 49 per cent.

Six profit making plantation management companies had committed to purchase 51 per cent of the shares in the Kotagala, Bogawantalawa, Agalawatta, Kegalle, Kelani Valley and Horana RPCs. Public subscription to the fixed price portion of the share issue was poor resulting in the underwriters having to purchase the balance. Fifty one per cent of the shares of Watawala, Madulsima, Maskeliya and Agarapatana RPCs, which were loss making were offered on an 'all or nothing' basis on the Stock Exchange. By the end of 1995, nine RPCs (excluding Agarapatana RPC) were privatised.

To increase productivity in the tree crop sector, various incentives such as subsidies for replanting, new planting and intercropping (for coconut) and a fertiliser subsidy were continued in 1995. In order to facilitate marketing, improve quality and ensure higher returns to producers of other export crops, a Spices and Allied Crops Marketing Board was established in 1995. This sector was also supported by intensive extension programmes, the provision of improved planting materials and easier access to credit, as in the past.

A major policy thrust was to achieve food security, particularly by increasing the productivity of paddy. Emphasis was laid on quality seed supplies, integrated pest management, straight fertiliser application to reduce costs and increase yields and the use of long aged varieties in the Maha season to increase productivity. However, the policy to subsidise wheat flour in the latter part of 1994 which was subsequently scaled down in 1995, adversely affected the paddy sector as well as some of the subsidiary food crops.

The Government decided to write-off all past due loans to farmers upon payment of 25 per cent, thereby restoring the eligibility of these farmers for new agricultural loans.

Concessionary credit at reduced interest rates continued to be provided to the agriculture sector mainly through the two state banks and local commercial banks. Credit was no longer refinanced by the Central Bank and instead, an interest subsidy was provided by the Government.

3.3 Export Crops

Tea

Sri Lanka's tea industry, once pre-eminent in the world, has been going through intermittent crises for a very long

time. The problems became accentuated after the

nationalisation of the local and foreign owned plantations.

The British business interests shifted to countries in the

African Continent such as Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania,

resulting in the emergence of stiff competition, especially

from Kenya. The emergence of coffee as a popular and

convenient beverage caused tea prices to stagnate,

compounding the industry's problems. The management of

the nationalised plantations under two large state owned

corporations - namely the Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation (SLSPC) and the Janatha Estates Development

Board (JEDB) - appeared inadequate to meet the daunting

task of adjusting to the new challenges of raising

productivity and remaining competitive. Direct state

intervention in the management of plantations for socioÂ­

political considerations took precedence over commercial

considerations. The period of their management was

characterised by large financial losses, wastage, increasing

costs and a decline in efficiency.

When compared with competitors such as India and

Kenya, Sri Lanka's record has been disappointing. Yields and

labour productivity have been the lowest, while the cost of

production of tea has been the highest. Productivity per

worker was also the lowest in Sri Lanka despite wages being

higher. Wage setting in the plantations in Sri Lanka had no

relation to productivity growth. Export duties had to be

reduced progressively and eventually, the exchange rate had

to bear the brunt to some extent of the adjustment required

in the face of the increasing cost of production and depressed

prices to keep the industry afloat. Continuous losses of the

plantations were financed by state directed credit.

In order to rectify these ills, in 1992, the Government

decided on a programme of restructuring. Initially, the

management of a majority of the state owned plantations

were handed over to private management companies on five

year contracts. As the management companies did not have

a stake in the ownership and as the leases were short-term

there was no incentive to invest in capital expenditure.

Therefore, the Government in 1995 took a courageous decision to privatise the management of the state plantations over a 50 year period, with the option to renew the leases.

Tea production in 1995, surpassed the peak production

of the previous year by 2 per cent to record 246 million kg.

This was due largely to favourable weather conditions, while

improved management of certain state plantations, higher

productivity from smallholders and attractive prices

particularly towards the latter part of the year, too,

contributed. The output of low grown teas increased for the

third consecutive year by 3 per cent to reach 122 million

kg which was the best production recorded so far at the low

24

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

elevations and accounted for the highest share of total tea production. The increased production was mainly due to high yields from better yielding clones planted in new cultivations. The output of medium elevations increased by 7 per cent, while the output of high grown tea declined by 4 per cent.

It is important to note that smallholders are more efficient producers than the well established state owned large plantations. Smallholders produce nearly 60 per cent of the total green leaf production with a cultivated area of about 45 per cent of the total. Approximately 65 per cent of tea smallholders are located in the low elevational areas in the Galle, Matara and Ratnapura districts.

Of late, Sri Lanka has made an effort to shift from orthodox tea manufacture to the CTC (Cut, Tear and Curl) method which has the advantage of faster brewing and is gaining popularity in markets. CTC production, which recorded a 41 per cent increase in 1994, expanded by a further 77 per cent to 20 million kg in 1995. Thus, CTC tea accounted for 8 per cent of the total production, as against 5 per cent in 1994. The number of CTC tea producing factories rose from 25 to 33 in 1995 as a result of the construction of new CTC tea factories and the conversion of some orthodox factories to the CTC process.

The estimated average cost of production (COP) of made tea increased by 5 per cent in 1995 to Rs. 79.14 per

kg mainly due to rising wage and fertiliser costs. However,

the average price of tea received at the Colombo Auctions

was lower than the COP for the fifth successive year. As a

result of the negative producer margins faced by many of

the factory owners over a prolonged period, the industry as

a whole faced a serious liquidity crisis. Several private

factory owners and several management companies have

managed to survive only by borrowing heavily from the

banks.

However, the average price of tea at the Colombo

Auctions recovered during the latter half of 1995. This was

attributed to the reduction of the exportable surplus of India

due to increased domestic consumption, the active

participation of the Commonwealth of Independent States

(CIS countries - former Soviet Union) and certain Middle

Eastern countries at the Colombo Auctions. The nominal

depreciation of the Sri Lanka Rupee against the US dollar

too helped to make tea competitive. The annual average

price of tea increased by 11 per cent to Rs.72.21 per kg at

the Colombo Auctions, while the average export price also

improved by 12 per cent to Rs.102.31 in 1995.

In the tea sector, fertiliser usage dropped by 5 per cent to 120,300 metric tons in 1995 owing to financial difficulties. This decline in fertiliser application in tea was partly the outcome of the financial crisis faced by tea growers and could have long-term adverse consequences on productivity, which is already far below that of her competitors.

As in the previous year, the new planting subsidy rates

in all three elevational areas remained at Rs.36,000 per

hectare. Replanting subsidy rates too remained unchanged at

Rs.67,000 per hectare for high and medium elevations and

Rs.57,000 per hectare for low elevations. The replanting

subsidy covers only about 25 per cent of the total replanting

cost. The total replanting and new planting subsidies

disbursed by the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority

25

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

(TSHDA) at Rs. 76 million during 1995 were marginally

higher than the 1994 level.

Apart from planting subsidies, the Government

continued to assist tea factory modernisation. The Tea

Factory Development Incentive Scheme and the incentive

scheme for CTC machinery continued in 1995. To encourage

the production of value added tea, the interest subsidy on

purchases of tea bagging machines was increased from 50

to 75 per cent. These subsidies were financed by levying of

special cesses on the industry. The tea cess remained

unchanged at Rs.2.00 per kg in 1995 and yielded Rs. 477

million, which was 2 per cent higher than in the previous

year.

Rubber

The local rubber industry enjoyed boom conditions

during 1995 with natural rubber prices reaching record levels.

However, the country was able to benefit from this only

partly since rubber production remained stagnant. Meanwhile,

costs tended to rise sharply, especially wages arising from

a shortage of labour.

According to the estimates of the Rubber Development

Department, rubber production showed only a marginal

increase of 0.4 per cent to 105.7 million kg in 1995, despite

rubber prices reaching record levels. Sheet rubber output

which accounts for the highest share of total output increased

by 3 per cent to 42 million kg. Production of technically

specified rubber increased more than two fold to 23 million

kg. On the other hand, crepe rubber production dropped by

9 per cent to 35 million kg in 1995.

The area under tapping increased by 2 per cent to

123,900 hectares, while the yield per hectare dropped by 2

per cent to 853 kg per hectare in 1995. The drop in yield

and stagnant production are due to low fertiliser application,

most rubber plantations being under old and relatively low

yielding clones, rain interference during the high tapping

season and a shortage of experienced tappers.

Rubber is predominantly a smallholder crop with 64 per

cent of the extent under tapping being in the hands of the

private sector smallholders. Improved prices provided some

incentive for replacing older rubber trees. During the year,

about 2,100 hectares were replanted, which was an increase

of 29 per cent over the previous year. However, the extent

newly planted in 1995 declined by 17 per cent to

approximately 553 hectares partly due to a shortage of

planting material. The subsidy for replanting was increased

from Rs.37,065 to Rs. 49,722 per hectare and for new

planting from Rs. 35,830 to Rs. 48,185 per hectare. The

beneficiaries of these enhanced payments were mainly

smallholders. The performance under the 1988 World Bank

funded Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation Programme was

disappointing. In 1995, the replanting target was 3,430

hectares (in the districts of Kalutara, Kegalle and Ratnapura)

but the actual extent replanted was only 1,329 hectares. This

programme envisaged replanting of 30,000 hectares and new

planting of 8,750 hectares by July 1996 but during the last

seven years the project has been able to achieve only about

a 50 percent success rate. Evidently rubber prices have been

unattractive for most of the time, providing little incentive

to increase the seedling stock in private nurseries. In

addition, excessive rain during the seasons had also reduced

the stock of seed available.

The average cost of production of rubber has been

estimated to have increased by 32 per cent to Rs.50.56 per

kg in the larger plantations. In the smallholder sector,

however, the increase was only 6 per cent to Rs.26.50 per

kg in 1995. The increase in cost of production was due to

higher costs of inputs, particularly wages arising from a

shortage of tappers and high cost of fertiliser. It is

noteworthy that the average cost, in smallholdings is half

that of larger ones.

There was a boom in rubber prices in 1995. The annual average price of RSS 1 at the Colombo Auctions rose by 43 per cent to Rs. 72.04 per kg. The average export (f.o.b.) price of all grades of rubber reached Rs.83.69 per kg, an

increase of 62 per cent. Hence, although the export volume

declined marginally to 68 million kg in 1995, export earnings

increased by over 59 per cent to Rs.5,713 million in 1995.

The demand for natural rubber in the international

market rose sharply in 1995, especially in the first nine

months of the year, owing to increased demand from the tyre

industry and capacity restraints in the synthetic rubber

industry. A decline in Malaysian rubber production further

helped to sustain high prices. Domestic consumption of

rubber too has shown a steady increase for the eleventh

consecutive year, arising from a noteworthy improvement in

the local rubber-based manufacturing sector. In 1995,

domestic consumption rose by 3 percent to 37 million kg,

which was a third of local production. The demand for

natural rubber is likely to remain high in the near future.

An incentive scheme was introduced in 1995 by the Rubber

Development Department for manuring mature rubber trees

and for fixing rain guards to facilitate tapping.

From 1 February 1995, the Rubber Replanting cess on

sheet and crepe rubber was increased from Rs. 1.15 to

Rs.3.85 per kg to replenish the Rubber Replanting Fund. The

cess was extended to other types of exported rubber from 1

July 1995. The collection from this cess is ploughed back

into the sector in the form of a subsidy for replanting.

Coconut

Coconut production in 1995 has been estimated to have

surpassed the previous years' level by 5 per cent, to register

an output of 2,755 million nuts. This was the highest crop

recorded since 1986. The increase in production was mainly

attributed to the lagged effect of the favourable weather

conditions that prevailed in the previous two years and

increased use of fertiliser. As expected, domestic prices of

coconut, which forms an important part of the daily diet,

declined modestly. The world prices for coconut kernel

products remained high owing to production uncertainties. As

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

a result, export earnings from coconut kernel products rose by 42 per cent to Rs. 3,521 million (29 per cent in SDR terms).

Generally, when fresh nut prices tend to decline owing

to an increase in supply, more coconuts are utilised for the

production of desiccated coconut (DC) where the profit

margins tend to be higher than in the case of other kernel

products. Further, international prices of DC, copra and

coconut oil improved in 1995. Accordingly, the nut

equivalent of DC production increased by 22 per cent to 465

million nuts. This is the highest on record since 1986. The

nut equivalent of coconut oil production increased by 12 per

cent to 540 million nuts, while the nut equivalent of copra

exports increased by 52 per cent to 49 million nuts. Fresh

nut exports in 1995, at 25 million nuts, was the same as in

the previous year. Domestic coconut consumption has been

estimated to have increased marginally to 1,692 million nuts,

accounting for 61 per cent of national production.

The total extent under coconut in 1995 was estimated

by the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) to be nearly

413,000 hectares, of which 1,235 hectares were newly

planted during the year. Certain new areas in the Moneragala

district, the Southern Province and the Mahaweli ' C area

have been brought under coconut cultivation. At the same

time, there has been a reduction of cultivation near urban

areas owing to the use of coconut lands for residential

construction. The average yield increased by 5 per cent to

6,671 nuts per hectare in 1995 when compared with 6,368

nuts per hectare in 1994. This was partly due to increased

fertiliser use by 8 per cent in 1995.

Coconut planting subsidies remained unchanged during

1995 at Rs. 25,000 per hectare for replanting (clear felling)

and new planting, Rs. 12,500 per hectare for staggered

replanting, Rs.7,500 per hectare for moisture conservation

and Rs. 10,000 per hectare for intercropping. During 1995,

the replanted area increased by 9 per cent to 917 hectares,

the newly planted area increased by 88 per cent to 1,235

hectares, the moisture conserved area increased by 14 per

cent to 1,212 hectares and the area inter-cropped increased

by 41 per cent to 1,188 hectares.

Increased supply depressed the average wholesale price

of fresh coconuts at the Colombo Auctions by 4 per cent

to Rs.3.52 per nut in 1995. However, the average export

price of the three major kernel products rose by 7 per cent

to Rs.6.08 per nut in 1995. This was because of an increased

world demand for all three kernel products, especially for

copra and coconut oil, during the latter part of the year, due

to reduced supplies of coconut products from the Philippines.

Export earnings from kernel products increased by 29

per cent in SDR terms, in 1995. The export earnings from

other coconut products such as coconut milk powder also

increased by 28 per cent.

Meanwhile, the average cost of production increased by

7 per cent to Rs.l.97 per nut in 1995 owing to wage

increases and higher fertiliser prices.

The financial assistance scheme for the installation of continuous drying systems for DC factories, which was introduced in 1993 by the Coconut Development Authority, continued in 1995. Cabinet approval has been obtained to continue this scheme upto 31 December 1997. Under the DC Mill Development Programme, DC millers were paid a subsidy of 40 per cent of the cost of the machinery, subject to a maximum of Rs.3 million per factory. During 1995, Rs.7 million was disbursed among 15 millers under this programme.

A programme to establish Coconut Growers' CoÂ­operatives commenced in 1995 and by the end of the year, 25 such societies had been formed. The CCB introduced a new 5 kg coconut fertiliser pack to popularise the use of fertiliser among smallholders.

To promote the use of high quality seedlings, a seed certification scheme was introduced with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture (DOA). To promote coconut cultivation, especially outside the Coconut Triangle, the CCB together with the Coconut Research Institute has planned to set up a research sub-station and a seed garden in the Southern Province.

A five year Coconut Development Plan (1995-1999)

was launched by the CCB to increase the productivity of

coconut lands through an effective extension service and the

provision of good quality seedlings.

Other Export Crops

The production performance of other export crops was mixed with crops such as cinnamon, citronella and nutmeg and mace recording increases and coffee, pepper and cloves registering decreases. The production of cinnamon quills during the year increased by 13 per cent to 11,056 metric tons compared to 9,774 metric tons produced in 1994. The significant improvement in cinnamon production has been attributed to improved maintenance practices adopted by the farmers due to the attractive prices. Further, harvesting of replanted and rehabilitated areas too have contributed to the increased production. Production of citronella and nutmeg and mace increased by 20 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.

Coffee production declined considerably by 51 per cent

to 1,800 metric tons in 1995. The drop in production of

coffee has been attributed to the inclement weather that

prevailed during the flowering season as well as the

physiological stress of the plants after two years of heavy

bearing in 1993 and 1994. Pepper production in 1995

dropped by 22 per cent to 3,665 metric tons compared to

4,708 metric tons harvested in 1994. Meanwhile, clove

production which had shown a downward trend in the recent

past declined by a further 3 per cent to 1,500 metric tons

in 1995.

The cumulative extent under all other export crops

during 1995 increased by 1 per cent to 69,442 hectares.

Notable contributions towards the increased extent came from

the expansion of the extent under cocoa and pepper by 440

hectares and 480 hectares, respectively, to 8,511 and 12,092

hectares, respectively.

at end 1995 stood at Rs.586 million. This was about 90 per

cent of the total allocation of Rs.650 million. The total extent

covered by the loans was 5,055 hectares as against the

targeted extent of 6,000 hectares.

3.4 Domestic Agriculture

Paddy

Paddy production increased by 5 per cent and reached

2.8 million metric tons (135 million bushels) in 1995 with

improved Maha and Yala crops. Favourable weather

conditions, increased use of fertiliser and timely availability

of credit facilities were responsible for this bumper crop in

1995.

Paddy production in Maha 1994/95 was estimated at

1.76 million metric tons (84 million bushels) and accounted

for nearly 63 per cent of the total output. This was 5 per

cent more than the production recorded during the previous

Maha season and is the second best Maha production

recorded since 1983. The improved performance during the

Maha season was entirely due to higher yield and was in

spite of a decrease in the extents sown and harvested

compared to the previous Maha season. For the eighth

consecutive year, the Kurunegala district recorded the highest

Maha production, amounting to 224,000 metric tons or 13

per cent of the production during the Maha season. The

Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Ampara

districts together accounted for 45 per cent of the total Maha

harvest.

The subsidies disbursed under the Export Agricultural

Crops Assistance Scheme (EAC) during 1995 was Rs.18

million as against Rs. 15 million in 1994. Pepper and

cinnamon producers received 71 per cent of the

disbursements.

World prices of several primary agricultural products

improved in 1995. The world price of black pepper increased

by 39 per cent to Rs. 139 per kg. This was the second

highest price recorded during the last decade. The local

farmgate price of pepper too rose by 43 per cent to Rs. 111

per kg. Similarly, the annual average international price of

coffee increased by 15 per cent to Rs.150 per kg while the

farmgate price of coffee rose by 25 per cent to Rs.98 per

kg. The farm gate price of cloves improved by 15 per cent

to Rs.52 per kg. Meanwhile, the annual average farmgate

price of cardamom rose by 2 percent to Rs. 337 and of

cocoa decreased by 8 per cent to Rs.49 per kg during 1995.

The 1990 Mid Country Perennial Crops Development

Project continued to assist farmers in 1995. Loans approved

Paddy production during Yala 1995 increased for the third consecutive year and was estimated at 1.05 million metric tons (50 million bushels). This was 3 per cent more than the production recorded during the previous Yala season. An increase in the net extent harvested as well as an improvement in the yield contributed towards this

enhanced production. As in the previous year, the Ampara district recorded the highest output level (198,000 metric tons), accounting for nearly a fifth of the Yala production. Paddy production in the Ampara, Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala districts together accounted for 48 per cent of the entire Yala production.

The annual average yield of paddy during 1995 improved by 5 per cent over the previous year to 3,535 kg per hectare. This was the best yield recorded since 1987. Improved performance during both seasons contributed to the improvement in the overall average yield during 1995. The average yield during Maha 1994/95 increased by 8 per cent to 3,603 kg per hectare. The average yield, which declined by 2 per cent during the previous Yala season, recorded an increase of one per cent to 3,427 kg per hectare during Yala 1995. The Mahaweli 'H' area once again regained its premier position during the Maha season, by recording an all time high of 5,340 kg per hectare relegating the Uda Walawe area, with an average yield of 4,888 kg per hectare, to second place. However, for the tenth consecutive year the Uda Walawe area recorded the highest average yield of 4,669 kg per hectare for the Yala season.

The average yield of major and minor irrigated areas during Maha 1994/95 increased by 15 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, to 3,923 kg per hectare and 3,292 kg per hectare, when compared with the previous Maha season. However, the average yield of the rainfed areas during Maha 1994/95 dropped by 1 per cent to 2,814 kg per hectare. The

average yield of the major irrigated areas during Yala 1995

dropped by 2 per cent to 3,529 kg per hectare. Meanwhile,

the average yield of the minor irrigated and rainfed areas

during Yala 1995 increased by 7 per cent and 2 per cent,

respectively, to 3,062 kg and 2,525 kg per hectare.

The total gross extent sown with paddy during the

cultivation year dropped by 2 per cent to 915,000 hectares.

The drop in extent sown was reflected in both seasons. The

gross extent sown during the Maha season dropped by 3 per

cent to 566,000 hectares while that of Yala also dropped

marginally to 348,000 hectares. The total gross extent

harvested during the 1995 cultivation year dropped by 1 per

cent to 890,000 hectares from 897,000 hectares in the

previous cultivation year. The gross extent harvested during

the Maha season dropped by 2 per cent to 549,000 hectares,

while that in Yala 1995 increased by 1 per cent to 340,000

hectares.

According to the National Fertiliser Secretariat (NFS), the fertiliser used in the paddy sector during the 1994/95 cultivation year rose by 17 per cent to 287,000 metric tons. This increase in the use of fertiliser could be attributed to the re-introduction of the fertiliser subsidy in October 1994 which coincided with the commencement of Maha 1994/95. Fertiliser used on paddy during Maha 1994/95 had increased significantly by 20 per cent to 171,000 metric tons, while the quantity used in Yala 1995 also increased by 12 per cent to 116,000 metric tons.

30

Part 1

The increased use of fertiliser, amongst other things,

was helped by the credit granted to the paddy sector. This

increased sharply with more farmers becoming eligible to

apply for credit from Maha 1994/95 onwards, owing to the

writing off of past due cultivation loans by the Government.

Credit granted to the paddy sector under the New

Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) during the

1994/95 cultivation year was Rs.806 million as against

Rs.660 million granted during the 1993/94 cultivation year.

Credit granted during Maha 1994/95 increased by 26 per

cent to Rs.570 million compared to Rs.453 million granted

during the previous Maha season. Credit granted during Yala

1995 also improved by 14 per cent over the previous Yala

season, to Rs.236 million.

There was a two fold increase in paddy purchases by

the PMB. The PMB purchased 282,000 metric tons of paddy

during 1995 as against 120,000 metric tons purchased during

1994, and accounted for 10 per cent of the total paddy

output. The sharp drop in the open market price of paddy

below the guaranteed price, especially during the harvesting

period, enabled the PMB to purchase a large quantity of

paddy in 1995. As in the previous year, the guaranteed price

of paddy remained unchanged at Rs.155 per bushel during

1995, but the market prices were around Rs.136 per bushel.

The partial removal of the wheat flour subsidy during the

latter part of 1995 was a welcome change to correct the

distortions created by the subsidy and, to some extent, arrest

the drop in paddy prices.

The rice equivalent of paddy produced, after adjusting

for wastage and seed paddy requirements, was 1.8 million

metric tons. Consequent to the increased production of

paddy, rice imports during 1995 declined to 9,000 metric

tons from 58,000 metric tons imported in 1994. This was

the smallest quantity of rice imported in the recent past.

However, wheat grain imports during the year increased by

28 per cent to 1.1 million metric tons compared to the

previous year. The substantial increase in wheat grain

imports despite very high international prices, could be

attributed to the heavily subsidised wheat flour prices which

increased the demand for wheat flour at the expense of rice.

Sugar

Sugar production during 1995, estimated at 71,416

metric tons, was 1 per cent less than the peak production

of 72,275 metric tons recorded in 1994. The drop in overall

output was solely on account of a 31 per cent drop in

production at the Hingurana factory, from 14,058 metric tons

in 1994 to 9,681 metric tons in 1995. Meanwhile, the sugar

production at the Pelwatte and Sevenagala factories increased

by 9 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, from 39,682

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

metric tons to 43,081 metric tons and from 18,535 metric

tons to 18,654 metric tons, respectively, in 1995. As in the

previous year, there was no production at the Kantale factory

during 1995.

The drop in sugar produced at the Hingurana factory

was attributed to the reduction in both the recovery rate as

well as a drop in the quantity of cane crushed during the

year under review, mainly on account of labour unrest at the

height of the harvesting season. The quantity of cane crushed

at Hingurana declined significantly by 23 per cent to 145,125

metric tons from 188,822 metric tons crushed a year ago.

In contrast, the quantity of cane crushed at the Sevenagala

factory increased by 5 per cent to 221,801 metric tons, while

the quantity of cane crushed during the year at the Pelwatte

factory increased by 16 per cent over the previous year to

547,900 metric tons. The total quantity of cane crushed in

all three factories during the year increased by 5 per cent

to 914,826 metric tons of cane from 873,990 metric tons

crushed during 1994.

The overall sugar recovery rate for all three factories

continued to drop for the third consecutive year and in 1995,

dropped to 7.81 per cent from 8.27 per cent in the previous

year. For the sixth consecutive year the Sevenagala factory

recorded the best individual recovery rate.

The average yield of sugar cane of the nucleus estates

at Hingurana and Sevanagala dropped by 27 per cent and 2

per cent, respectively, to 41 metric tons and 88 metric tons

per hectare. The average yield at Pelwatte, which increased

by 23 per cent in 1994, recorded a further 9 per cent

increase to 60 metric tons per hectare in 1995. Sevanagala

continued to record the highest average yield for the fifth

consecutive year. The overall average yield of all three

nucleus estates maintained by these factories remained at the

same level as in 1994.

The quantity of cane supplied by private cultivators to

sugar factories rose by 14 per cent to 316,383 metric tons

in 1995. Cane purchased by Hingurana increased

substantially (by 35 per cent) to 65,583 metric tons.

Meanwhile, the cane purchased at Sevanagala and Pelwatte

increased by 9 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, to

1,898 and 248,902 metric tons. Private cane purchased

accounted for 35 per cent of the total cane crushed during

the year as against 32 per cent recorded during 1994.

Presently, domestic sugar production is adequate to meet only about 15 per cent of the country's sugar consumption requirements. The quantity of sugar imported during 1995 was 416,909 metric tons compared to 491,000 metric tons imported in 1994.

Other Field Crops

Other Field Crops (OFCs) consist of a heterogeneous group of crops varying from high value cash crops such as chillies, onions and potatoes, to low value cereals such as maize and kurakkan. Except for the high value crops mentioned above, all the OFCs are grown in a very ad hoc manner in home gardens or in small plots of land. Therefore, most available data with respect to these crops are crude estimates.

According to the provisional estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands and Forestry (MALF) the output of potatoes, soya bean and sesame (gingelly) improved significantly in 1995. The potato harvest increased by 44 per cent to 101,600 metric tons and was one of the best in the recent past. Both an improvement in the yield and an increase in the extent cultivated contributed towards this increased production. The potato yield during the year increased significantly by 36 per cent to 11,250 metric tons per hectare compared to 8,300 metric tons per hectare achieved in 1994. The significant improvement in the potato yield and extents cultivated could be attributed to the availability of large stocks of good quality imported seed potato, favourable weather conditions and the extension of cultivation into non-traditional areas. Sesame production recorded a 74 per cent increase to 6,100 metric tons

compared to 3,500 metric tons produced in 1994. However,

sesame production in 1995 was less than half the production

recorded in 1991, which may be attributed to reduced

production in the unsettled areas in the Northern and Eastern

Provinces and the respective border villages.

The production of most other OFCs in 1995 was poor compared to the previous year (Appendix Table 16). Big onion production, which recorded an all time high of 81,400 metric tons in 1994, declined drastically by 45 per cent to 44,500 metric tons in 1995. Problems faced by big onion growers, especially in marketing their produce after the bumper crop in 1994, discouraged the cultivation of this crop in the subsequent year. The extent under big onion dropped from 7,800 hectares in 1994 to 4,400 hectares by 1995. The production of red onions, chillies and green gram recorded decreases of 18 per cent, 10 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, compared to 1994. The drop in production of these crops during 1995 was attributed to the reduced extents cultivated especially during Maha 1994/95, as the climatic conditions were more favourable for paddy cultivation.

The floor price scheme operated by the PMB for OFCs

continued to be in force during 1995. The floor prices have

not changed since 1993. As a result, the floor prices have

become less attractive and private traders became active

market participants in competition with the PMB.

3.5 Fish and Livestock

According to the estimates of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, fish production in 1995 was 237,550 metric tons. This was a 6 per cent increase when compared with the previous year. Both marine and aquaculture sectors contributed to this increased production. Meanwhile, the production of dry fish declined by 24 per cent in 1995. Marine fish production increased during the year, mainly on account of the addition of new boats, engines and fishing gear to the industry, as well as the cessation of hostilities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces until the latter part of April 1995. Further, the increase in the conversion of day boats to multi-day vessels also contributed to the improvement in the output. The increase in aquaculture could be attributed to better management and strengthening of the extension services in fresh water fisheries.

The marine fishery sub-sector, which accounted for 92 per cent of total fish production, increased by 3 per cent to 217,550 metric tons in 1995 from 212,000 metric tons recorded in 1994. As in the past, the private sector played the most prominent role in the fisheries sector and accounted for nearly 99 per cent of total fish production. The total fish supply of the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation (CFC) increased by 8 per cent to 2,400 metric tons in 1995. Ice production by the CFC, which declined by 18 per cent in the previous year, rose by 38 per cent to approximately 5,090 metric tons in 1995, mainly due to the recommencement of production at two ice plants at Anuradhapura and Pesalai.

Subsidies disbursed to the marine sector amounted to approximately Rs.60 million in 1995, when compared with Rs.75 million disbursed in 1994. Under the producer subsidy schemes, 196 mechanised day boats, 40 multi-day boats, 333 traditional crafts, 406 fishing gear units, 19 SSB radios and

42 navigators were issued to the marine fishery sector. In the previous year only 40 multi-day boats, 145 traditional crafts and 69 mechanised day boats had been issued. As in the previous year, the total number of fisheries co-operative societies and their total membership remained unchanged at 769 and 86,966, respectively.

Though production increased, the average retail prices

of all species of fish increased by about 22 per cent when

compared to the previous year. The total volume of fish

exports increased by 4 per cent to 7,457 metric tons in 1995

from 7,194 metric tons recorded in the previous year.

However, the total volume of fish imported in the form of

canned and dry fish also increased by 21 per cent to 68,348

metric tons during the year.

The private sector continued to play a major role in egg

production in 1995 as well. Total egg production decreased

marginally from 863 million eggs in 1994 to 862 million in

1995. This was mainly due to many small farmers being

pushed out of business due to the high price of poultry feed

as a result of the near monopolistic situation in the provender

industry and a drop in the egg production of the National

Livestock Development Board farms.

Total cow milk production increased marginally to 253

million litres, while buffalo milk production dropped by 2

per cent to 80 million litres in 1995. The volume of milk

collected by Milk Industries of Lanka Company Limited

(MILCO) in 1995 increased by 14 per cent to 50 million

litres, from 44 million litres recorded in 1994. Increased milk

collection in the Anuradhapura and Batticaloa districts

contributed towards the overall improvement. The volume of

milk collected by Nestle Lanka Limited and other milk

collecting centres also increased by 9 per cent from 35

million litres collected in 1994, to 38 million litres in 1995.

Total domestic milk production meets only about 30 per cent

of the country's requirements of milk and milk products. This

is an area where effective import substitution could take

place. The price paid to the producer for a litre of milk

did not increase in 1995 resulting in a low remuneration to

the milk producer. Further, a duty waiver of 10 per cent had

been granted to import full cream powdered milk (with over

26 per cent milk fat) which benefited consumers but acted

as a deterrent against the expansion of the local dairy

industry.

3.6 Inputs and Credit

Fertiliser

The total quantity of fertiliser used in the calendar year

1995, dropped by 5 per cent to 506,400 metric tons. This

33

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

was due to a reduction in the use of fertiliser in all crops

other than in coconut. Fertiliser used by the paddy sector

dropped by 4 per cent and accounted for 51 per cent of

fertiliser used during the year, mainly due to a reduction in

the area cultivated. In the tea sector, fertiliser use dropped

by 4 per cent to 120,300 metric tons in 1995. The use of

fertiliser in the rubber sector declined by 13 per cent to

14,900 metric tons in 1995. Fertiliser used in other crops

such as tobacco, vegetables, fruits and flower plants declined

by 10 per cent to 34,900 metric tons. There was an 8 per

cent increase in the use of fertiliser by the coconut sector.

In spite of the fertiliser subsidy (reintroduced in October

1994), there was a reduction in the total use of fertiliser

especially in the last quarter of 1995 by about 15 per cent.

The decline during this period is attributed to the failure of

the North-East Monsoon that resulted in drought conditions

which was not conducive for the application of fertiliser. The

decline in fertiliser usage may also be attributed to the

increase in international fertiliser prices.

The 30 per cent fertiliser subsidy on the four major fertiliser ingredients, namely urea, sulphate of ammonia (SA), muriate of potash (MOP) and triple super phosphate (TSP) was terminated on 31 January 1995. However, due to the significant increase in the import price of urea and TSP, as an interim measure, a subsidy was introduced for these two ingredients for the period 1 February 1995 to 3 April 1995. The subsidy paid to the importer was at the rate of US dollars 80 per metric ton for urea and US dollars 20 per metric ton for TSP. A new fertiliser subsidy scheme was implemented with effect from 4 April 1995, where the ceiling subsidy rates payable to importers were fixed at US dollars 131 per metric ton of urea, US dollars 29 per metric ton of SA, US dollars 19 per metric ton of MOP and US dollars 59 per metric ton of TSP to maintain the market

price of a 50 kg bag of urea at Rs.500, SA at Rs.420, MOP

at Rs.500 and TSP at Rs.540. When the import price of urea

declined in May 1995, the ceiling price for the subsidy was

adjusted to US dollars 101 per metric ton and subsequently

readjusted to US dollars 131 per metric ton when the price

increased. According to the NFS, the cost of this subsidy

scheme is estimated at Rs. 1,700 million per year.

Approximately 95 per cent of the country's requirement

of inorganic fertiliser is imported. The only inorganic

fertilisers produced locally are rock phosphate at Eppawela

in the North Central Province by Lanka Phosphate Ltd. and

dolomite (which has other uses than as a fertiliser) from the

central hills by a few organisations. The production of rock

phosphate increased by 20 per cent to 32,115 metric tons

in 1995. This continued to substitute for imported rock

phosphate and is mainly applied to perennial crops.

In order to improve the efficiency and competitiveness

in the fertiliser sector, the Government has encouraged the

participation of the private sector, which now accounts for

nearly 40 per cent of fertiliser sales by approximately 10

wholesale traders.

Seed

The use of high quality seed and planting material

increases yields and fanners' income. The Seed and Planting

Material Centre of the Department of Agriculture (DOA) is

able to produce only 5-10 per cent of the total seed

requirement of the country. Therefore, the DOA encourages

and facilitates farmers and the private sector to produce

certified quality seed. Under the Diversified Agricultural

Research Project funded by the USAID, the private sector

which includes both large and small-scale businesses as well

as farmer organisations and co-operatives, has been able to

participate in the development of the local seed industry.

Since the liberalisation of the economy, the private sector

has become the major importer and distributor of seed

subject to plant quarantine, where the local seed industry is

not able to meet the domestic requirement. This stresses the

need for a national seed policy in order to develop the local

seed industry with the active participation of the private

sector.

The Seed and Planting Material Centre of the DOA was able to issue over 4,100 metric tons (198,000 bushels) of seed paddy and seed material for a variety of OFCs, such as maize (62,000 kg), soya bean (13,000 kg) and green gram (12,000 kg) during 1995.

The research activities of the DOA had led to the

identification of several new varieties of rice varying from

3 1 / 2 - 5 months in addition to a local 'Basmathi' variety

for release in 1995. The DOA has also been able to identify

many new varieties of OFCs (e.g. chillies, green gram and

early maturing cowpea varieties) that are characterised by

better yields, longer storability periods, higher resistance to

viruses and ability to survive drought. Further, the DOA had

identified promising varieties of vegetables and fruits that

have superior yields, tolerance to certain viruses and better

shelf life.

Agro-Chemicals

Agro-chemicals, which include insecticides, weedicides

and fungicides are imported. The Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation and the private sector are the importers of these

products. Wholesale and retail distribution are mainly done

by the private sector. All agro-chemical imports have to be

registered with the Registrar of Pesticides (ROP) of the

DOA.

In 1995, according to the ROP, total sales of agro-chemicals increased by 13 per cent to 6,740 metric tons. Weedicide sales, which account for nearly 45 per cent of total agro-chemical sales, rose by 10 per cent to 3,043 metric tons. In the wake of increasing labour wages and the scarcity of labour, the use of weedicides over the years has increased, indicating that farmers are shifting to chemical weeding in place of manual weeding. Insecticide sales which are about 42 per cent of total agro-chemical sales, increased by 21 per cent to 2,843 metric tons, while fungicide sales which accounts for about 13 per cent of total agro-chemical sales, increased marginally in 1995.

As the demand has increased for agro-chemicals, greater

emphasis is now being placed on integrated pest management

methods for reasons of reducing cost of production,

environmental protection and health/security considerations.

Credit

Cultivation loans granted under the NCRCS during the 1994/95 cultivation year amounted to Rs.1,180 million, compared to Rs.977 million granted during the previous cultivation year.

The decision of the Government to write off past due cultivation loans in September 1994 subject to the condition that 25 per cent of the principal sum in default was repaid, made more farmers eligible for new cultivation loans. This explains the substantial increase in the loans obtained during the 1994/95 cultivation year. However, this kind of general amnesty is not desirable as it could have several adverse repercussions on credit culture.

Of the total loans granted during the year, 67 per cent or Rs.791 million was granted during Maha 1994/95, while the balance Rs.389 million was granted during Yala 1995. The loans granted during Maha 1994/95, increased by 25 per cent compared to the previous Maha season, while those granted during Yala 1995 increased by 13 per cent over the previous Yala season. Of the total loans granted during the cultivation year, 68 per cent or Rs.806 million was granted to the paddy sector, while the balance Rs.374 million was granted for cultivation of OFCs. The two state banks together accounted for 80 per cent or Rs.943 million of the cultivation loans granted.

Although the formal financial sector has increased the quantum of cultivation loans granted to the rural agricultural sector, this sector still depends largely on informal sources of financing to meet most of its credit needs.

3.7 Forestry

According to the Forest Department (FD), the forest

cover in 1994 was around 2 million hectares, which was

about 31 per cent of the total land area. The net annual

average deforestation is estimated at 38,000 hectares due to

the increasing demand on forest resources by an ever

expanding population and increasing economic activity.

According to the MALF, if current trends in deforestation

continue, the closed canopy forests, defined as forests having

over 70 percent of canopy cover, would decline as a

percentage of total land area from 24 per cent in 1992 to

about 17 per cent by the year 2020. This indicates a bleak

outlook for the forestry sector, as its capacity to meet the

needs of the population on a sustainable basis is expected

to diminish gradually.

The main causes of deforestation as identified by the MALF are landlessness and a poor land tenure system, large

35

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

agricultural and settlement projects, reservoir and hydro

power projects, 'chena' (shifting) cultivation, conversion of

natural forests for other crops and excessive harvesting of

forest products. The serious problems that will arise as a

result of deforestation and forest degradation are reduction

in bio-diversity (due to the destruction of the habitats of

wildlife and plants), irregular water supply, shortened lifespan

of irrigation channels and reservoirs, soil erosion and

resulting loss of fertility and scarcity of wood supply. These

will have a negative impact on agricultural production.

As identified in the National Policy Framework of the

MALF, the most urgent need at present is a national land

use policy that would guide agricultural development and

settlement policies so that, simultaneously, bio-diversity is

conserved, watersheds protected, the landless are provided

with land and timber and other forestry products are

adequately supplied. A National Forestry Policy was

approved by the Government in 1995. With a view to

achieving the optimal development of the forestry sector a

comprehensive long term development framework, referred

to as the Forestry Sector Master Plan (FSMP), was drawn

up in 1995 by the MALF, covering the period 1995-2020.

The FSMP particularly emphasises conserving the remaining

natural forests to maintain bio-diversity while increasing

overall tree cover and empowering people, especially in rural

communities, to manage and protect multiple-use forests to

meet the needs of the population (fuel wood, timber, etc.).

In order to arrest rapid deforestation, the FSMP has projected

that about 3,000 hectares of forest plantations should be

established annually. From the year 2000, about 200 hectares

of closed canopy forests and 1,000 hectares of sparse forests

and mangroves should be regenerated and about 4,000

hectares should be reforested annually.

In 1995, the FD, with assistance from the International Development Association (IDA) and the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), was able to raise 8.2 million seedlings, reforest 3,475 hectares, maintain 23,864 hectares of forest plantations and attend to silvicultural treatment of 11,481 hectares of forest cover. Under the Participatory Forestry Project (especially to raise the supply of fuel wood and general utility timber), the FD was able to involve over 51,000 families, including farmers, in planting approximately 6,900 hectares of homesteads and woodlots, while strip planting 127 kilometers by roadsides, rivers and canals. Under this project, over 4.4 million plants were raised by the FD, in collaboration with schools, nonÂ­governmental organisations, agrarian centres and farmer organisations. The Forestry Extension Programme raised more than 1.2 million plants. The FD was able to achieve about 85 per cent of the annual target for the year under these various programmes. In addition, the FD was able to conduct awareness programmes on reforestation and forestry extension.

According to the FD, 5,191 forest offences were recorded in 1995, which involved 2.7 million cubic decimeters of timber valued at Rs.29.3 million. This indicates only the officially recorded extent of deforestation, while a substantial extent goes undetected.

In 1995, projects in environmental management in the forestry sector included the National Conservation Review Survey (which assesses the bio-diversity in all natural forests), the Sinharaja Conservation Project, the Knuckles Conservation Project and the Mangrove Conservation Project. With a view to developing the forestry sector, various research activities were carried out in the year, including trials with respect to tree improvement, under planting, teak block planting, fertiliser application and fire control methods.
