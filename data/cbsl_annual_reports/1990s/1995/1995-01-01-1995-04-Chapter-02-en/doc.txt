2. NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

2.1 Overall Trends

In 1995,' Sri Lanka continued to maintain the rapid

momentum of economic growth achieved during the last

several years with the progressive liberalisation of the

economy. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.5

per cent in real terms, the same rate of growth as the annual

average during the previous five years. At the same time,

the Gross National Product (GNP) (which is GDP adjusted

for factor income from abroad) grew by 5.9 per cent,

reflecting a sharp drop in investment income outflows during

1995.

The GDP at current market prices in 1995 has been estimated as Rs. 661,902 million. The mid year population having been estimated as 18.1 million, the per capita GDP in 1995 is estimated to be Rs. 36,545 or US dollars 713. Although this is the highest per capita income recorded by any South Asian country (Maldives US dollars 623, Pakistan US dollars 404, India US dollars 286, Bangladesh US dollars 208, Nepal US dollars 169) , it is yet far behind industrial nations (Japan US dollars 36,739, USA dollars 25,852, Germany US dollars 22,539), Asian city states (Singapore US dollars 23,532, Hong Kong US dollars 18,895) and other emerging economies of Asia (Taiwan US dollars 12,187, South Korea US dollars 8,540, Malaysia US dollars 3,558, Thailand US dollars 2,411), but somewhat close to Indonesia (US dollars 909).'

It should be noted, however, that extreme caution should be exercised in comparing national economies in terms of GDP and drawing inferences on their relative living standards. Recently, attempts have been made to measure GDPs in terms of the purchasing power of the US dollar. Even these only approximate to reality, but the fact remains that Sri Lanka has a long way to go to catch up even with the emerging economies of Asia.

However, the resilience of the economy in a year

following a change of government after 17 years augurs well

for the future. A strong commitment by the new

administration to open and market friendly economic policies

established a continuity of policies irrespective of political

differences, which was strongly welcomed by investors. Also

welcomed was a strong commitment to settle the lingering

conflict in the North and the East by negotiation.

1 Datapertain to 1994, exceptforTaiwan (1995) and Bangladesh, India and Hong Kong (1993). Corresponding per capita GDP for Sri Lanka in 1993 and 1994 were US dollars 587 and 656, respectively. (Sources: International Financial Statistics-IMF, March 1996 and World Tables-World Bank ,1995).

Unfortunately, the negotiations were aborted in April 1995

and the subsequent resumption of hostilities continued to be

a drag on the economy in terms of production and

investment. Compounding the situation was a retrenchment

of foreign investment in emerging economies of Asia, due

to the uncertainties created by the crisis of the Mexican

economy in late 1994.

The satisfactory performance of the economy in 1995

was also aided by good weather and an improvement in

primary commodity prices in the case of agriculture. It is

noteworthy that Sri Lanka achieved a record rice crop during

the year, despite the disincentive of lower prices induced by

the subsidisation of wheat flour prices. Incidentally, rice

imports were reduced to virtually nothing during 1995.

Rubber and tea fetched record prices but structural problems

prevented the sectors from benefitting fully from the boom

conditions by raising production. The predominantly state

owned plantation agriculture continued to suffer from low

productivity, high costs and financial constraints. On the

whole, the Agriculture sector (including forestry and fishing)

recorded a growth of 3.3 per cent in 1995, almost at the

same rate as in the previous year, but its share in GNP

declined from 21 to 20 per cent. Its contribution to economic

growth declined from 13 per cent in 1994 to 12 per cent,

most of the contribution coming from paddy and non-

plantation agriculture, notably chillies, potatoes, onions,

vegetables and other produce for domestic consumption.

Meanwhile, the fisheries sector recorded a noteworthy growth

of 5 per cent.

The diminishing role of the Agriculture sector is a cause for concern because it provides employment to about 37 per cent of the labour force, meets a large portion of the country's food requirements, contributes to 22 per cent of exports and has the potential of meeting the raw material needs of agro-based industries. The problems of the state owned plantation sector are expected to be met by the current policy of privatising their management on the basis of long-term leases, which will provide an incentive to the new managers to improve productivity. In the field of non-plantation agriculture, efforts are being made to reduce the heavy hand of government in land alienation, import regulation, direction of credit and inputs and excessive protection.

The rapid growth of the Manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka has been a recent phenomenon, a direct result of the liberalisation of the economy. In fact, this sector overtook the Agriculture sector for the first time in 1995 and emerged only slightly behind the lead sector, Wholesale and retail

trade. The Manufacturing sector grew by 9 per cent, at about

the same rate as in the previous year. The sector's share of

the economic growth of 1995 of 31 per cent was the highest,

and over twice that of the next highest sector. Factory

industries alone contributed to 28 per cent of the economic

growth in 1995. This strong performance of factory industries

was evident mostly in export-oriented industrial production.

In fact, industrial exports accounted for 75 per cent of Sri

Lanka's export earnings in 1995, as in the previous year. The

share of the Manufacturing sector in GDP rose from 20 per

cent in 1994 to 21 per cent in 1995. Within factory

industries, food beverages and tobacco, textiles, wearing

apparel and leather products and non-metallic mineral

products recorded strong growth performance during the

year. The leading sub-sector was textiles, wearing apparel

and leather products which grew by 13 per cent, followed

by food, beverages and tobacco which rose by 11 per cent.

While the robust growth of the Manufacturing sector is a healthy feature of the economy, the heavy reliance on textiles and garments would be a cause for concern as the international Multi-Fibre Agreement, which has created a regime of country export quotas to large markets, will be wound up gradually. This would call for inducing the industry to improve productivity to reach non-quota markets and fostering newer industries with export potential.

Rapid growth of the Services sector (items 5 to 11 in Table 2.1) is a widespread phenomenon in fast growing economies. This sector grew by 5 per cent in 1995 and contributed to 44 per cent of the recorded economic growth. High growth in this sector was sustained mainly by an expansion in the Wholesale and retail trade, Transport, storage and communication and Banking, insurance and real estate sectors. The Wholesale and retail trade sector continued to be the lead sector, accounting for nearly 22 per

Purchasing Power Parity GNP Per Capita

The Gross National Product (GNP) per capita of a country does not provide a good measure for comparing

income across countries because it does not show what that per capita income can buy in different countries. In

order to adjust for the purchasing power of different currencies, and hence to facilitate cross country comparisons,

the GNP per capita is converted to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) GNP per capita. A conversion factor is required

to transform per capita GNP to GNP (PPP) per capita. This conversion factor is defined as the number of units of

a country's currency that are required to purchase the same representative basket of goods and services that a US

dollar would buy in the United States, or a similar basket of goods and services. Although the reference currency

is the US dollar, any other currency could be used as the unit of account.

On the basis of the latest (1993) data given in the World Development Report 1995 of the World Bank, the

GNP (PPP) per capita values for industrialised countries were somewhat lower than the corresponding per capita

GNP, whereas for the newly industrialised countries of East Asia - Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea, the

GNP (PPP) per capita values were higher than the per capita GNP, with a narrower gap between the two indicators.

In the case of the fast growing countries of East Asia - Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, as well as the South

A.sian countries - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the GNP (PPP) per capita values were much

higher, ranging upto nearly six times the corresponding per capita GNP values. The GNP (PPP) per capita for Sri

Lanka was almost five times the corresponding per capita GNP. It becomes apparent that the income disparity

among countries is less pronounced when GNP (PPP) is examined than when absolute GNP values are considered.

For example, the USA's per capita GNP in dollar terms was 40 times that of Sri Lanka, whereas the GNP (PPP)

per capita of the USA was only about 8 times that of Sri Lanka.

cent of GNP. There was a slow growth of import trade, but

export and domestic trade showed improvement. The

Financial sector, with its direct linkages to the fast growing

sectors of the economy, grew by 11 per cent as compared

with 10 per cent in 1994. The sector's contribution to

economic growth was 10 per cent in 1995, as in 1994,

reflecting the continuing expansion of Banking, insurance and

financial services. The Transport, storage and communication

sector grew by 5.5 per cent, largely due to an increase in

road haulage brought about by the expansion in the output

of the agriculture and industrial sectors and a notable

increase in the passenger transport fleet. In addition, there

was a rapid expansion in communication and port activities

during the year. Communication services grew by 14 per

cent and was one of the most dynamic growth sectors. Port

handling grew by 7 per cent, reflecting increased volumes

of exports and trans-shipment cargo handling.

GNP at current factor cost prices is estimated to have

increased by 14.8 per cent in 1995. The implicit GNP

deflator, which is a measure of overall price changes in the

economy, increased at a lower rate of 8.4 per cent in 1995,

compared to 9.4 per cent in the previous year. This growth

in the deflator was also consistent with the inflation trends

indicated by the aggregate price indices, namely, the

Colombo Consumers' Price Index, the Greater Colombo

Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index.

Gross Domestic Expenditure at market prices of

Rs.725,710 million, registered a growth of 12 per cent in

1995. Consumption expenditure rose by 14 per cent and

investment expenditure by 6 per cent. There was a

deceleration in the growth of private consumption

expenditure from 16 per cent in 1994 to 13 per cent in 1995,

largely accounted for by the decline in prices. Government

consumption expenditure on public administration and

security rose sharply by 24 per cent.

Gross Domestic Capital Formation increased by 6 per

cent to Rs. 166,370 million, a major portion (87 per cent) of

which was accounted for by the private sector. Government

investment recovered from the decline during the 1994

election year to increase by 18 per cent, whereas private

investment, when adjusted for aircraft purchases in 1994 and

1995, recorded a trend growth of 9.6 per cent, which was

lower than in the previous year owing to the slowdown in

foreign investment and construction activity. When adjusted

for inflation, the overall Gross Domestic Fixed Capital

Formation in real terms showed a marginal decline of 1 per

cent in 1995, compared with an increase of 9 per cent in

19

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

the previous year. The decline was mainly due to the sharp

decline in foreign investment.

Reflecting the continued buoyancy of the economy

and attractive incentives available to savers, domestic savings

are estimated to have risen to Rs.102,562 million in 1995,

an increase of 16 per cent. As a ratio of GDP, this shows

an improvement from 15.2 per cent in 1994 to 15.5 per cent

in 1995. Meanwhile, along with foreign savings, the national

savings ratio has shown a healthy improvement from 19.1

per cent to 19.7 per cent.

2.2 Sectoral Performance

Value added in agriculture increased by 3.3 per cent

in 1995. The sluggish growth of this sector has reduced its

relative importance in GDP. In the early 1960's the share

of agriculture in GDP was around 40 per cent. This had

declined to 23 per cent by 1990. The ratio dropped further

to 20 per cent in 1995 and below that of the industrial

sector. This development was also partly a result of the

gradual transformation of the Sri Lankan economy towards

a more diversified structure.

Value added in tea, rubber and coconut in 1995

registered increases of 1.6 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 5.1 per

cent, respectively. Although rubber prices almost doubled

during the year, production increased only marginally by 0.4

per cent. Meanwhile, the domestic consumption of natural

rubber has increased in recent years owing to the growth of

rubber based industries. Tea prices too showed an

improvement in the latter part of the year. Coconut

production further expanded by 5.1 per cent in 1995,

following a 20.6 per cent increase in the previous year,

reflecting the lagged effects of favourable weather and

increased fertiliser use. Altogether, these three plantation

crops contributed 18 per cent of total export earnings and

84 per cent of agricultural exports. However, the importance

of these crops within the sector has been diminishing as a

result of crop diversification and lack of investment, owing

to resource constraints and weak management.

Paddy, the most important single crop, registered a 4.7 per cent annual growth in 1995 and reached a record level of 2,810 thousand metric tons. With this increase in output and a decline in the demand for rice on account of heavily subsidised wheat flour, the imports of rice during 1995 dropped to a negligible level.

'Other agriculture', which consists of all the other

crops and animal husbandry, grew by 2.6 per cent in 1995.

The output of most subsidiary food crops increased

considerably during the year. There was also a noteworthy

growth in animal husbandry. Poultry farming, which has

become more organised in production and marketing in the

recent past, performed well during the year. Milk

production, which was stimulated by regular buying activities

of organised private institutions, increased by 11 per cent in

1995. However, the contribution of minor export crops to

growth was negative as some major items registered

production decreases.

The fisheries sector performed favourably in 1995.

The addition of new boats, engines and fishing gear,

increased conversion of one day boats to multi-day vessels,

and increased deep sea fishing were the major contributory

factors to the high growth in fish production. The cultivation

of prawns for export too emerged as a highly lucrative

operation.

In the Mining and quarrying sector, gem mining,

which accounts for a large share, suffered a setback in 1995.

Export earnings of precious and semi-precious stones

declined by 7 per cent in SDR terms during the year.

However, other mining activities, especially graphite,

performed well. An upsurge in the ceramic and tile industry,

which is mainly aimed at international markets, led to a

growth in quarrying of raw materials. Altogether, the mining

and quarrying sector grew by 3.4 per cent in real terms in

1995.

The Manufacturing sector, which includes factory

industry, processing of tea, rubber and coconut products and

small industry, has been the leading growth sector for well

over a decade. Its share in GDP has increased steadily from

14 per cent in 1982 to 20 per cent in 1995. Within the

sector, factory industry accounts for 82 per cent of value

added, which reflects the slow expansion of the plantation

and a fair under-estimation of the small industry sector.

The expansion of factory industry was supported by inducements provided under the liberalisation measures implemented since 1989 and attractive tax concessions granted from time to time. Substantial growth in the industrial sub-categories of textiles, wearing apparel and leather products, food, beverages and tobacco, and fabricated metal products, which accounted for more than 85 per cent of industrial output, were the major contributors to growth in the factory industry sub-sector. The share of factory industry in the Manufacturing sector has risen from 65 per cent in 1982 to 82 per cent in 1995.

The other important sub-sector under manufacturing

was processing of tea, rubber, and coconut kernel products.

This sub-sector registered a 4.4 per cent growth in 1995,

reflecting the trends in agriculture referred to earlier. Small

industries, which are mainly industries operating at the

20

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

household level, have been estimated to have grown by 6.5

per cent in 1995 as against 5.7 per cent in the previous year.

There is evidence of strong growth of this sector, which

expanded and created new self-employment opportunities, but

estimation is difficult owing to a lack of numbers. The other

industry category, which includes mainly the bakery industry

and paddy milling, expanded by 7.8 per cent, reflecting the

effects of increased paddy output and growing demand for

bakery products.

The Construction sector, consisting of building

construction and infrastructure development projects,

registered a 5 per cent growth in 1995, contributing 6 per

cent to overall economic growth, as compared to a growth

of 6 per cent and a contribution of 8 per cent in 1994.

Evidently, the reduction in foreign capital inflows has led

to a slowing down in construction activities in the industrial

and services sectors. Moreover, temporary shortages of

cement and rising prices along with some delays in

implementation of housing projects led to a slowing down

in housing construction activities. However, road construction

expanded during the year, as a result of utilisation of higher

allocation of funds by the Government to this sector.

The Electricity, gas, water and sanitary services

sector grew by 10.2 per cent. The gas sub-sector registered

the highest growth, indicating the changing consumer

preference for liquified petroleum gas. Electricity generation

grew by 10 per cent in 1995, while the supply of pipe borne

water through foreign funded projects also increased during

the year.

in GNP. The communication sub-sector registered the highest

growth rate of 14 per cent, partly due to increased

investment by the Sri Lanka Telecom. Increased private

sector participation helped the growth process there. In 1995,

the number of cellular phones, paging units and pay phone

booths increased by more than 75 per cent. The value added

in postal services and port and shipping activities also

expanded during the year. There was a notable increase in

containerised cargo handling following the modernisation of

port facilities in Colombo. Storage and container yard

facilities also expanded in parallel to cope with increasing

demand.

The transport sub-sector, which includes road

haulage, public bus transport, rail transport and air transport,

grew by 4.2 per cent in 1995. The growth in export and

domestic trade raised the value added in road haulage. A

large number of buses were assembled and put on the road

during the year. Rail transport registered a marginal increase

in value added, while air transport also expanded with

enhanced capacity created by the reflecting of the national

airline.

The Wholesale and retail trade sector grew by 4 per

cent in 1995 compared with 6 per cent in the previous year.

Although its contribution to overall growth in GNP dropped

sharply from 27 per cent in 1994 to 13 per cent in 1995,

largely owing to a decline in import trade, the sector

continued to maintain its leading position. Value added in

export trade grew by 12.6 per cent and in domestic trade,

by 2.2 per cent.

The growth of the Transport, storage and

communication sector rose from 3 per cent in 1994 to 6 per

cent in 1995 and contributed to 11 per cent of the growth

The value added in the Banking, insurance and real

estate sector registered a growth rate of 11 per cent in real

terms, while its contribution to the overall GDP growth was

around 10 per cent. Facilities and services provided by the commercial banking sector improved further in 1995. Commercial banking represented around 53 per cent of this category. A notable expansion of domestic credit and diversification of services with new instruments and modern facilities contributed to the expansion of the commercial banking sector. Further, the opening of new commercial banks during the year represented growing confidence, creating a conducive environment for the growth of banking activities. The depressed share market activities affected value addition by brokering firms. The insurance sub-sector, which has become more competitive, expanded rapidly during the year. Introduction of new insurance policies and aggressive selling campaigns helped the growth of the industry. The value added in this sector increased by 4 per cent in 1995.

2.3 Expenditure

Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) at market prices of Rs.725,710 million showed an increase of 12 per cent in 1995. Consumption expenditure and investment expenditure grew by 13.9 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively, during the year. Private consumption expenditure (PCE), which accounted for more than 85 per cent of the overall consumption expenditure, increased by 12.7 per cent in 1995. This growth was lower than the growth in nominal income, and as a result, private consumption as a ratio of GDP dropped marginally. The drop in private consumption in relation to GDP was also partly a result of the drop in the demand for durable consumer goods. The import of consumer goods, which accounted for 28 per cent of the basket of Private Consumption Expenditure, declined significantly from 24 per cent in 1994 to 13 per cent in 1995. Government consumption expenditure rose by 24 per

cent, mainly due to salary increases, subsidies and higher

defence expenditure.

Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF), which

represents the investment expenditure of both the private

sector and the government sector, increased by 6 per cent

to Rs. 166,370 million. Government investment recovered

from a dip in 1994 to register a growth of 18 per cent in

1995, to Rs.20,927 million. The private sector investment

expenditure rose by 5 per cent in 1995 to Rs.145,443

million, following a growth of 30 per cent recorded in 1994.

The higher growth in 1994 was mainly due to the purchase

of aircraft by the national airline, Air Lanka. When adjusted

for aircraft purchases, the private investment to GDP ratio

dropped by 1.2 percentage points, which was largely

accounted for by the drop in foreign direct investment (FDI).
