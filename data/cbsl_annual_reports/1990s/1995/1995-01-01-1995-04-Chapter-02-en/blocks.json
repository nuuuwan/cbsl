The problems of the state owned plantation sector are expected to be met by the current policy of privatising their management on the basis of long-term leases, which will provide an incentive to the new managers to improve productivity. In the field of non-plantation agriculture, efforts are being made to reduce the heavy hand of government in land alienation, import regulation, direction of credit and inputs and excessive protection.",

A notable expansion of domestic credit and diversification of services with new instruments and modern facilities contributed to the expansion of the commercial banking sector. Further, the opening of new commercial banks during the year represented growing confidence, creating a conducive environment for the growth of banking activities. The depressed share market activities affected value addition by brokering firms. The insurance sub-sector, which has become more competitive, expanded rapidly during the year. Introduction of new insurance policies and aggressive selling campaigns helped the growth of the industry. The value added in this sector increased by 4 per cent in 1995.",

Consumption expenditure and investment expenditure grew by 13.9 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively, during the year. Private consumption expenditure (PCE), which accounted for more than 85 per cent of the overall consumption expenditure, increased by 12.7 per cent in 1995. This growth was lower than the growth in nominal income, and as a result, private consumption as a ratio of GDP dropped marginally. The drop in private consumption in relation to GDP was also partly a result of the drop in the demand for durable consumer goods. The import of consumer goods, which accounted for 28 per cent of the basket of Private Consumption Expenditure, declined significantly from 24 per cent in 1994 to 13 per cent in 1995. Government consumption expenditure rose by 24 per",
