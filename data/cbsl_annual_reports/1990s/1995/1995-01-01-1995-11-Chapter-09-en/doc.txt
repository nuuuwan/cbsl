9. TRADE, BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND TOURISM

9.1 Overview

Sri Lanka's balance of payments (BOP), after five

consecutive years of overall surpluses, recorded an overall

deficit of SDR 62 million in 1995, mainly as a result of a

decline in private capital inflows. However, on the positive

side, exports fared well and the trade and current account

deficits dropped sharply. The trade deficit narrowed

significantly from SDR 1,089 million (13.3 per cent of GDP)

in 1994 to SDR 921 million (10.8 per cent of GDP) in 1995

due to the improved export performance as well as a sharp

drop in the growth of imports. With this improvement in the

trade account, a small surplus in the services account and

higher net private transfer receipts, the current account deficit

dropped from SDR 526 million (6.5 per cent of GDP) in

1994 to SDR 358 million (4.2 per cent of GDP) in 1995.

The export sector benefitted from improved international prices for most agricultural and some industrial products, the depreciation of the exchange rate and conducive weather conditions for major plantation crops, and registered a growth rate of 12 per cent in SDR terms as compared with 9 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile, the import growth rate decelerated sharply from 16 per cent in 1994 to 3 per cent in 1995 as a consequence of the drop in imports related to foreign private investment and a reduction in imports of durable consumer goods with the depreciation of the exchange rate. The terms of trade declined by 1.3 per cent, due to a rise in the prices of major import commodities such as wheat, sugar, milk products and fertiliser against favourable prices for major agricultural export products.

Net capital inflows dropped to half their level in 1994,

despite a 19 per cent increase in net inflows of official

sale of a major share holding of Colombo Gas Co. Ltd.

Direct foreign investment dropped to one third of the 1994

level due to the cautious attitude of foreign private investors

in the aftermath of a change of government in 1994, labour

unrest and uncertainties regarding the domestic security

situation after the breakdown of the government initiated

peace negotiations with the separatist terrorists. Inflows of

private loan capital also dropped mainly due to tapering off

of the financing arrangements under Air Lanka's reflecting

programme during the first half of the year and a reduction

in import related short term trade credits.

There were several positive developments on the policy

front. Reflecting the Government's continued commitment to

an open trade and exchange system, the tariff structure was

further rationalised during the year by reducing the maximum

tariff from 45 to 35 percent, reducing the number of tariff

rate bands from 4 to 3 and eliminating ad hoc duty

exemptions. The exchange rate was largely market

determined and it reflected the underlying macroeconomic

fundamentals. The external payments system remained

transparent with the convertibility of the rupee being assured

for all current account transactions, all capital inflows, debt

repayments and other reasonable capital outflows including

foreign investments abroad on a case by case basis. In

addition, the setting up of a separate body on privatisation,

the Public Enterprises Reform Commission (PERC), with

well defined functions was intended to build up foreign

investor confidence.

In 1994, the country received SDR 56 million from the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the first instalment

Composition of

under the third Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility

(ESAF) programme. The ESAF programme with the IMF

expired during the first quarter of 1995 without the second

instalment of SDR 56 million being drawn. The above

developments in the external sector led to a drop in Sri

Lanka's gross external assets by SDR 63 million during

1995. The level of gross external assets which stood at SDR

1,729 million at the end of the year was sufficient to finance

5.4 months of imports projected for 1996. The debt service

ratio as a percentage of earnings from goods and services

increased to 13.8 per cent, from 13.3 per cent in the previous

year.

9.2 Exports

Plantation Crops

Export earnings from plantation crops grew by 15

percent and contributed to the entirety of the 12 per cent

growth in agricultural exports in 1995. The value of tea

increased by 7 per cent to SDR 317 million in 1995 owing

to a volume increase of 5 per cent and a price increase of

2 per cent. A drop in world tea stocks due to supply

shortfalls in major producing countries, increased global

demand for tea due to some recovery of markets in the

former Soviet Union, now the Commonwealth of

Independent States (CIS), and an improvement of the quality

of Sri Lanka's tea led to a considerable improvement in tea

prices during the second half of the year. Reflecting the

attempts made by Sri Lanka to recapture its share in the

emerging markets, tea exports to the CIS increased by kg

27 million and accounted for 17 per cent of total tea exports

in 1995 as compared with 5 per cent in the previous year.

This was at the expense of tea exports to the Middle Eastern

market. In addition, a 2 per cent increase in tea production

in 1995 also helped to increase export supply.

Export earnings from rubber recorded a significant increase of 46 per cent to SDR 74 million entirely due to an upsurge in international prices (47 per cent) following a recovery of demand in industrialised countries particularly in Japan and the USA. This was due to revival of the car manufacturing industry, increased demand from China and sluggish supply from major rubber producers such as Malaysia. In addition, there is a growing global demand for natural rubber by certain industries such as surgical gloves and heavy duty tyres.

Earnings from exports of coconut products rose by 28, per cent to SDR 68 million in 1995 entirely due to higher volumes of exports. Increased domestic supply due to favourable weather conditions as well as over supply in other major coconut producing countries depressed coconut prices in the first half of the year. However, the average export price of coconut products in 1995 increased in US dollar terms although in SDR terms it dropped by 2 per cent.

Other Agricultural Products

Earnings from exports of other agricultural products declined by 2 per cent in 1995 in contrast to a 4 per cent increase registered in 1994. This was partly the result of a decline in domestic production of some agricultural crops due to rainy weather conditions that prevailed during the flowering season. In addition, gherkin exports, according to sources in the industry, suffered a setback owing to sharp competition from India since 1995. Export volumes of vegetables dropped sharply by 49 per cent entirely due to a 64 per cent volume drop of gherkins, while volumes of coffee and pepper declined by 71 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively.

Industrial Products

Industrial exports rose by 13 per cent to SDR 1,887 million in 1995 with major increases recorded in textiles and garments (13 per cent) and other non-petroleum industrial exports (15 per cent).

The average export prices of textiles and garments

remained stable in SDR terms as in 1994. Textile and

garment exports continued to be the leading export

sub-category, contributing to about two thirds of total

industrial exports. The volume of garment exports alone rose

by 8 per cent while prices increased by 4 per cent. This was

reflected in higher exports to both 'quota' and 'non-quota'

markets, with a more pronounced growth of exports to non­

quota markets. The normal annual increases in quotas,

lowering of quota limits in under-utilised categories and

increasing quota limits in the more popular categories with

the rescheduling of the U.S. quota year from July-June to a

calendar year, and the more liberal and transparent

management of quotas helped to increase exports.

Earnings from petroleum products exports remained

around the same level (SDR 56 million) as in the previous

year. Petroleum products accounted for 3 per cent of

industrial exports and a mere 2 per cent of total exports. The

temporary closure of the refinery in early 1995 for

maintenance purposes and the fire damage to oil storage

facilities in October led to higher than expected import

outlay on refined petroleum products. However, exports of

petroleum products were not affected. In fact, the volume of

petroleum product exports rose marginally in 1995 with

prices remaining at more or less the same level as in the

previous year.

Earnings from other non-petroleum industrial products rose by 15 per cent in 1995 and accounted for 32 per cent of total industrial exports. Among the major categories, increases were recorded in leather, rubber, paper, wood and ceramics (17 per cent), diamonds (6 per cent), food, beverages and tobacco (8 per cent), machinery, mechanical and electrical appliances (27 per cent) and jewellery (25 per cent). Financial and institutional incentives extended to non-traditional exports, particularly by the Export Development Board (EDB), continued to facilitate these export items. In addition, the diamonds and jewellery export sector benefitted from the liberalisation of the import of rough gemstones and exemption of import duty and turnover tax on machinery, equipment and other items used in the gem and jewellery industry introduced in November 1995. As in the recent past, this other industrial exports category reflected continued dynamism and helped to diversify the export base.

Mineral Products

The export earnings from minerals dropped by 5 per cent to SDR 57 million owing to a drop in gem exports. The volume of gem exports declined by 11 per cent due to low domestic production. The cost of mining increased mainly due to higher costs of deeper mining as well as inputs such as fuel and machinery. In addition, the sector is facing stiff competition in international markets particularly from low cost producing countries such as Madagascar which entered the market recently. Export earnings from other mineral products rose by 13 per cent to SDR 6 million benefitting from the higher demand for graphite and mineral sands.

9.3 Imports

Consumer Goods

Imports of consumer goods declined marginally with the outlay on food and drinks rising by 2 per cent and on other consumer goods declining by 3 per cent. There was a sharp drop in durable consumer goods imports. Demand for these items was sluggish due to the depreciation of the rupee in 1995. Major decreases were recorded in motor cars and motor cycles (17 per cent) and radio receivers and television sets (21 per cent). The diesel tax which was introduced with the 1995 budget and discontinuation of duty concessions for car imports to the public sector also contained import demand for motor vehicles in 1995.

The impact of increased international prices of rice and sugar (6 per cent each) on the trade account was offset by lower volumes of imports due to increased domestic production of rice and draw down on available stocks. Consequently, import outlays of rice and sugar dropped by 83 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Reflecting increased international prices, the import outlay on milk and milk products rose by 19 per cent.

Intermediate Goods

Imports of intermediate goods rose by 13 per cent reflecting major increases in wheat grain (57 per cent),

fertiliser (30 per cent), petroleum (23 per cent) and paper and paper boards (21 per cent). Increased international wheat prices due to historically low levels of production in major wheat producing countries and of world wheat stocks in 20 years in the context of growing demand in major consuming countries, raised the world wheat prices as much as 33 percent in 1995. The impact of these high prices on Sri Lanka was further compounded by higher volumes of imports due to increased domestic demand following the introduction of a wheat flour subsidy in 1994. Imports of textiles grew by only 6 per cent against a 13 per cent growth in exports of textiles and garments, as part of the raw material needs were met by drawing down of stocks and increased domestic production of yarn. In the case of fertiliser, a higher volume had to be imported to meet the anticipated increase in domestic demand after the reintroduction of the fertiliser subsidy. In addition, world fertiliser prices increased due to lower supplies from the Ukraine and increased demand from other countries such as India and China. While the volume of crude oil imports dropped by 2 per cent as a result of the temporary closure of the refinery at the beginning of the year for maintenance, import outlay on petroleum products rose due to increased volumes of refined petroleum products imports resulting from losses suffered as a result of the fire at the oil storage facilities. The average import price of petroleum products also rose by 3 per cent in 1995. In response to sustained high demand from the manufacturing sector,, imports of all other intermediate goods rose by 10 per cent in 1995.

Investment Goods

Imports of investment goods dropped significantly by 18

per cent to SDR 783 million in 1995 mainly due to

decreases in transport equipment (37 per cent), machinery

and equipment (15 per cent) and other investment goods (8

per cent). Investment goods imports excluding aircraft

imports by Air Lanka declined by 10 per cent in 1995. The

outlay on transport equipment (excluding aircraft) dropped

by 18 per cent mainly due to significant decreases in imports

of public transportation vehicles and tractors. The drop in

the machinery and equipment category was reflected in a

reduction in the imports of sewing machines. Reflecting the

continued expansion in the construction sector, imports of

building materials rose by 7 per cent in 1995. The overall

drop in investment goods imports warrants serious

consideration as it corresponds to a drop in domestic

investment which would constrain the future growth potential

of the economy.

9.4 Services

In 1995, net foreign exchange receipts on account of

services remained around the same level as in the previous

year with both receipts and payments increasing by 10 per

cent each to SDR 688 million and SDR 680 million,

respectively. Major items that contributed to the increase in

receipts were passenger fares, investment income and other

services while higher outflows were also observed in the

same categories. Increase in passenger fare earnings reflected

the expansion of activities of Air Lanka after reflecting by

increasing the frequency and capacity of its flights.

Tourist arrivals upto September 1995 recorded an overall increase compared to 1994. However, with the significant decline in arrivals during the fourth quarter of the year, particularly in the month of December, the year ended with a marginal decrease of 1 per cent in arrivals. In addition, the average length of stay declined in 1995. The combined outcome was a 2 per cent decline in earnings from tourism in US dollar terms, although the decline was greater in SDR terms. With the increase in income levels and a completely liberalised current account, there has been an increase in the demand for foreign travel by residents as evidenced by the number of package tours offered by travel agents. This situation coupled with increased travel for education and migration for employment abroad resulted in higher outflows in the travel category than in the previous year.

Although the external assets of the country decreased by SDR 63 million, interest earnings increased corresponding to the investments made at higher international interest rates during the first half of the year and appropriate shifts made in the foreign investment portfolio of the Central Bank. Due to the cautious attitude of investors against the backdrop of an unsettled conflict with the terrorists, outflows on account of profits and dividends continued rather than being used for reinvestments in Sri Lanka.

9.5 Transfers

Net transfers remained at SDR 554 million during 1995, despite a fall in official transfers from SDR 117 million in 1994 to SDR 107 million in 1995. As migration for employment abroad continued and remittances for family maintenance took place as usual, the growth of private transfer receipts was sustained at 12 per cent in US dollar terms, although it showed a slower growth rate in SDR terms than in the previous year.

9.6 Capital Movements

The poor performance of the capital account which

recorded a sharp reduction in net inflows from SDR 700

million in 1994 to SDR 350 million in 1995 had a

pronounced effect on the trade account (i.e. a reduction in

imports) and the overall balance, as well as the future growth

potential of the economy.

Long-Term Capital

The inflow of long-term capital to the Government

increased by 11 per cent, although it was somewhat lower

than what was anticipated in the Budget due to under

utilisation of project aid in some projects. The major sources

of concessional assistance continued to be Japan (SDR 135

million), the International Development Association (IDA)

(SDR 71 million) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)

(SDR 58 million) which together accounted for about 77 per

cent of total inflows of SDR 344 million. Gross inflows

increased mainly due to higher disbursements relating to

recently committed foreign loans.

Foreign direct investment which included privatisation

proceeds from the sale of Colombo Gas Co Ltd, declined

by 66 per cent to SDR 38 million in the wake of the

uncertain security situation since April, the recent experiences

of labour unrest and uncertainty regarding possible

implications of the proposed Workers' Charter and the

investors' cautious approach following the change of

government in 1994 after 17 years.

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

In 1995 the financing arrangements for Air Lanka's reflecting programme arrangement came to an end with the import of the fifth and final aircraft (SDR 68 million) and the inflows of private long term loans during 1995 were lower than those in the previous two years. Due to a cashflow mismatch and resource problems, the two development finance institutions raised US dollars 57 million from abroad towards end 1995 to continue their long-term lending operations. However, only US dollars 14 million was disbursed out of these loans in 1995. Investors' attitude to utilise existing capacity rather than install additional capacity also reduced the flow of long term loan capital. Meanwhile, FCBU lending to BOI enterprises increased significantly by an estimated SDR 35 million during the year, thereby helping to maintain economic activities and new investments to some extent.

Short-Term Capital

Net short-term capital flows to the private sector declined to SDR 58 million in 1995 from SDR 182 million in the previous year. The CPC made a further net repayment of SDR 10 million in 1995 on account of import credits. The overall drop in short-term trade credits was reflected in the depressed level of new investment as well as sluggish growth of intermediate goods imports relative to their corresponding manufactured exports growth rates. The manufacturers minimised the utilisation of trade credits for working capital requirements by allowing stocks to deplete in the wake of increased opportunity costs of carrying high stocks. Meanwhile, off-shore balances held by BOI enterprises rose significantly, leading to higher outflows of short-term capital. Had the domestic investment climate been more favourable some of these funds may have been reflected as reinvestments by these enterprises.

Portfolio investment through the share market remained sluggish during the year. However, there was some positive development between June and November, 1995, when net inflows of foreign capital of about SDR 9 million virtually offset the net outflows which occurred during the first five months of the year. After the Mexican crisis, which had a destabilising effect on world financial and foreign exchange markets, foreign investors generally shied away from emerging markets such as Sri Lanka back to established financial centres.

9.7 External Assets

Sri Lanka's gross external assets decreased by 4 per cent to SDR 1,729 million at the end of 1995 from SDR 1,792 million at end 1994. The decline was entirely reflected in the commercial bank assets which dropped by SDR 62 million to SDR 341 million in 1995. Gross official reserves comprising foreign assets of the Central Bank and the Government declined marginally from SDR 1,389 million to

markets. Meanwhile, the combined Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) index against trading partners and competitors depreciated by 8 per cent, while the corresponding Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) index depreciated by 3 per cent during this period, a favourable movement in Sri Lanka's competitiveness indicator in 1995.

9.9 External Debt

Sri Lanka's total outstanding external debt at the end

of 1995 was estimated at SDR 6,460 million recording an

increase of SDR 369 million during the year. This increase

was reflected mainly in the medium and long term debt of

the Government, predominantly concessional assistance from

Japan and the IDA. Meanwhile, outstanding government

guaranteed debt of public corporations rose to SDR 370

million mainly due to the loan obtained by Air Lanka as

final instalment of the reflecting package. There were no new

government guaranteed private sector loans taken in 1995.

Outstanding private sector external debt without government guarantees increased from SDR 237 million to SDR 259 million entirely due to FCBU borrowings of BOI enterprises. With the repayment of SDR 22 million and no further IMF drawings during the year, total outstanding debt to the IMF declined to SDR 400 million at the end of 1995.

The stock of short term capital was limited to

acceptance credits of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

(CPC), import related trade credits of both Board of

Investment (BOI) and non-BOI enterprises and net short-term

FCBU borrowings of BOI enterprises. Outstandings on such

capital rose by SDR 58 million between the two years, 1994

and 1995.

Effective Exchange Rates

An exchange rate can be expressed either in terms

of the national currency value of a unit of foreign

currency (price quotation system) or foreign currency

value of a unit of the national currency (volume

quotation system). While it is customary to express the

exchange rate in the former, the latter is a more

appropriate indicator to assess the extent of appreciation

and depreciation of the national currency1. For example,

the annual average exchange rate of the rupee against

the US dollar moved from Rs.49.42 in 1994 to Rs.51.25

in 1995, and hence the US dollar value of the rupee

dropped from 20.23 US cents to 19.51 US cents per

rupee during this period. Accordingly, the average

nominal exchange rate (NER) of the rupee against the

US dollar depreciated by 4 percent in 1995, in nominal

terms.

However, one cannot solely rely on the REER indicator

to gauge the variations in competitiveness, as it does

not adequately capture the impact of a host of other

factors such as the changes in macro-economic policies,

changes in the trade and exchange system including the

changes in the regulatory and institutional environment

and productivity changes. In addition, there could be

data deficiencies, particularly in the price indicators.

Nevertheless, effective exchange rate indicators are

widely used to assess competitiveness. The main focus

of the NEER and the REER is on the trade balance,

particularly the exchange rate induced changes in trade

flows. A trend appreciation of the real effective

exchange rate is considered unfavourable for the growth

of export and import competing industries.

Two other widely used indicators to measure

exchange rate changes are the Nominal Effective

Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange

Rate (REER)2.

The NEER is a weighted average of major bilateral

nominal exchange rates, with weights based on the trade

shares reflecting the relative importance of each

currency in the effective exchange rate basket3. The

REER is obtained by adjusting the NEER for inflation

differentials with the countries whose currencies are

included in the basket. As the inflation rate in each

country is assumed to broadly indicate the trends in

domestic costs of production, the REER is expected to

reflect foreign competitiveness of domestic products.

Sri Lanka's NEER with trading partner/competitor

countries, taking 1990 as the base year, stood at 78.2

at end 1995, indicating a depreciation of 22 per cent

during the past five years. This reflects faster

depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee in nominal terms

than its partner/competitor countries' currencies. The

REER, which is also affected by variations in domestic

and foreign inflation rates, in addition to the variations

in the NEER, fluctuated within a range of -3 per cent

and +13 per cent around the base period index of 100

during 1990 - 1995.

In 1995, the combined inflation rate of the trading

partner/competitor countries was around 5.5 per cent as

compared with an annual inflation rate of 11.5 per cent

(point to point) in Sri Lanka. Despite relatively higher

inflation in Sri Lanka, the REER depreciated by 3.1 per

cent in 1995, following the depreciation of the NEER.

foreign loans, increased by 16 per cent to SDR 441 million

in 1995. Both amortisation and interest payments increased

by SDR 43 million and SDR 19 million, respectively.

Amortisation payments to the IMF increased due to the

commencement of repayments on account of the Structural

Adjustment Facility (SAF) taken in 1989. Amortisation

payments to others increased by SDR 29 million. Despite

the growth of exports by 12 per cent during the year, the

debt service ratio rose from 13.3 per cent in 1994 to 13.8

per cent in 1995 indicating that debt service payments have

outpaced the growth in exports. Debt service payments as a

ratio of receipts from the exports of goods, services and

private transfers also increased from 11.3 per cent to 11.8

per cent between the two years.

9.11 External Sector Policy

Exchange Rate

Taking into account a number of economic and financial

indicators including recent trends in the Real Effective

Exchange Rate (REER), the Central Bank announced the

daily buying and selling rates for the intervention currency,

the US dollar, with a 2 per cent margin between these two

rates and was ready to buy or sell the US dollar for Sri

Lanka rupees. This wide margin provided the necessary

flexibility for commercial banks to quote their own buying

and selling rates. The behaviour of the exchange rate in the

market in relation to the Central Bank's buying and selling

rates was an indicator of the short-term exchange market

conditions. For the most part of 1995, the market rate

remained very close to the Central Bank's buying rate with

the exception of a few short periods of intense speculation

during which the market rate depreciated considerably and

later corrected itself.

Import and Export Controls

Sri Lanka maintained an open trade policy regime with

only a few exceptions as in the past. Four categories of

exports remained under licence (coral chunk and shells, wood

and articles of wood, ivory and ivory products and passenger

motor vehicles registered in Sri Lanka prior to 1945) on the

grounds of protection of environment and preservation of

antiques. The remaining import licencing requirements were

due mostly to public health, public morals, environmental

protection and national security reasons. The import licencing

106

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

requirement of four items, namely, wheat, meslin, wheat and

meslin flour was maintained in terms of a past contract

entered into by the Government with a private flour milling

company. Certain agricultural items, namely potatoes, big

onions, chillies and maize, remain under licence with the

objective of providing protection to domestic producers.

Textile Quota Allocation

To ensure the continuous availability of quotas to

deserving exporters, allocation of textile quotas is primarily

based on their past performance. Once the initial allocation

is made, two per cent of the balance is allocated to other

registered exporters who have "small quota holdings" (none

or less than 5,000 dozens for the preceding year), on a pro­

rata basis of the number of employees. The remainder is put

to a common pool and allocated among exporters, taking into

consideration other factors such as payments of EPF and

ETF contributions. The pool quota scheme improves

allocation and utilisation of quotas and also provides

opportunities to both existing "small quota" holders as well

as newcomers to the industry.

Tariffs and Taxes on External Trade

Under the ongoing tariff reforms, the country made

further progress in the rationalisation of the tariff system in

1995. The four band import tariff structure with 45, 35, 20

and 10 per cent rates which came into effect in November

1993 was replaced in February 1995 by a three band system

with 35, 20 and 10 per cent rates. However, a few categories

of imports remained outside the new system i.e. tobacco,

liquor, crude oil and some categories of motor vehicles.

With the 1995 budget, the tariff structure was further

simplified by eliminating several ad hoc duty waivers and

exemptions. Duty waivers were considerably reduced during

the latter half of the year limiting them to well defined

purposes. In an effort to help certain agricultural activities,

as well as the printing, fishing, wood products and film

industries, duties on imports for these sectors were reduced

with the 1996 budget. Import duties were reduced from 35

per cent to 10 per cent for agricultural implements such as

mamoties, forks, etc., printing and writing papers and

exercise books. Import duty on fishing nets was reduced

from 35 per cent to 20 per cent. Duty exemptions were

granted for fibre-glass and certain other inputs and engines

used in the construction of fishing boats, all varieties of

imported timber in log or sawn form and raw films, movie

cameras, movie projectors, screens and certain spare parts

imported for the local film industry.

In order to promote gem and jewellery exports, raw

materials, (i.e. gem stones, gold and other accessories) as

well as imports of tools, machinery and equipment for

cutting and processing of gems were permitted duty free.

Moreover, the exemption from the National Security Levy

given to imports used in manufacture for export was

extended to cover consumables in the manufactured exports

sector as well.

The export sector continued to be free from any

ad-valorem sales taxes and duties during 1995, while export

cesses and royalties on some items remained. In the wake

of improved international rubber prices, the rubber export

cess was first increased from Rs.2.21 per kg to Rs.4.91 per

kg in February 1995 and later, to Rs. 5.41 per kg in July

1995.

Freight rates

During 1995, efficiency of shipping services improved

further due to increased competition among shipping lines.

The emergence of Non-vessel Operating Common Carriers

(NVOCCs) in shipping which are known for their low cost

operations resulted in a further lowering of freight charges

during the year. Shipping lines covering major trade

destinations such as the UK, North continent, Egypt and

Syria changed their freighting structure from a commodity

based system to a freight of all kinds (FAK) system in 1995,

while shipping lines covering the Mediterranean, Singapore

and France continued their FAK system which had been

introduced earlier. Due to the adoption of the new system,

freight rates for tea, desiccated coconut and garments to the

UK and the North continent declined by 6 per cent while

the freight rates for rubber, rubber gloves, activated carbon

and brooms and brushes dropped by 12 per cent. The freight

rates for all commodities shipped to the Mediterranean and

France declined by 5 per cent each while the rates for

Singapore remained unchanged. Freight rates for exports of

garments and tea to the USA, East Canada and Japan were

also reduced, while the rates to the Middle Eastern countries

remained unchanged.

Incentives to Exporters

The export sector continued to be provided with several

fiscal, financial and institutional incentives. The Duty Rebate

scheme, the Manufacture-in-Bond Scheme and the Duty Free

Clearance of Machinery scheme continued to operate in

1995. Financial assistance for both small scale and large

scale exporters in the non traditional areas also continued

during 1995.

In addition, the EDB provided a wide array of other

services including the organisation of several local and

foreign seminars and workshops, in order to enhance

awareness of export procedures, marketing, packaging and

Tariff Reforms in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka had a highly distorted trade policy

objective of moving towards a lower uniform single tariff, a three band rate structure of 10, 20 and 35 per

cent was put in place in February 1995 by reducing the

maximum rate. However, higher import tariffs were

maintained for liquor, tobacco, crude oil and some

categories of motor vehicles for revenue and social

reasons. In addition, to make the tariff structure

more simple and transparent, some of the remaining

concessions and exemptions were removed or modified

under the new tariff structure. The revised tariff

structure has reduced effective protection for domestic

industries, thereby motivating them to be more efficient

and to be more competitive in international markets.

product development through technological improvement. The

programme of assistance to export oriented Small and

Medium Enterprises (SMEs) introduced in 1994 continued

during 1995 with expanded activities. Accordingly, several

workshops were organised for a number of non-traditional

product sectors, which included high value added items such

as handicrafts, jewellery and leather products. The EDB

organised the "Apparel 95" fair in Colombo in October 1995

for garment manufacturers and providers of ancilliary

services to the garment industry.

The Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation

(SLECIC) continued to assist exporters by way of issuing

bank guarantees and providing insurance schemes. The total

number of policies and enhancements issued during the year

recorded a 43 per cent increase while the value of those

policies increased by 71 per cent. However, the number of

guarantees issued dropped by 10 per cent while the value

of the guarantees issued declined by 19 per cent. The

SLECIC continued its credit guarantee scheme introduced in

1994 to enable duty free access to foreign exhibitions for

exporters of gems and jewellery, and also introduced a rebate

scheme to encourage early redemption of guarantees. In

addition, an insurance policy scheme to assist entrepot traders

was introduced in 1995.

Sri Lanka entered into a joint venture during the year under the Bondsmen Concept with Russia to help reduce the storage costs of tea small holder exporters. A joint venture with Pakistan was also established in order to recapture the Pakistan market that was lost during the past few years. Tea is to be exported in bulk form to Pakistan which would then be packeted and marketted through 840 outlets in Pakistan.

Trade Relations, Trading Arrangements and Clearing Arrangements

Sri Lanka became a founding member of the World

Trade Organisation (WTO) which was established in January

1995. Sri Lanka has bound all tariffs on agricultural

products numbering 2,228 tariff lines at the rate of 50 per

cent under her commitments to the WTO. The scope of tariff

binding on industrial products has remained small with the

same ceiling rates applicable as in agriculture. Sri Lanka's

commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in

Services (GATS) are limited to tourism and tourist related

services. However, Sri Lanka's current trade policy regime

is far more liberal than her commitments to the WTO. In

particular, her actual maximum tariff rate of 35 per cent is

below the bound rate of 50 per cent, while the services'

sector is already open for foreign competition (financial

services are opened to foreign participation upto 49 per cent

of total investment).

The WTO, in consultation with the Government and

contracting parties, conducted a major review of Sri Lanka's

trade policy regime and trade practices in 1995. The

objective of this exercise was to assist in improving

adherence to GATT/WTO rules, disciplines and

commitments, thus contributing to smooth functioning of the

multilateral trading system. The Trade Policy Review

Committee was of the opinion that trade policies and

practices have evolved in a positive direction and that Sri

Lanka had made significant progress towards removing

distortions created by the past import substitution policies.

The Committee also recognised that trade liberalisation,

South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement

The South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement

(SAPTA) as agreed upon by the members of the South

Asian Association for Regional Corporation (SAARC),

comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,

Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, came into force with effect

from 7 December 1995. The SAPTA aims at promoting

both economic co-operation and trade in the region through

the removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers, In principle,

the SAPTA is based on overall reciprocity and mutual

advantage for the equitable benefit of all member states,

taking into account their respective levels of economic and

industrial development, the pattern of their external trade

and their tariff policies. Recognising the wide differences

in Ihe level of economic development among the member

stales (Table 1), the SAPTA agreed to offer special

treatment to the least developed contracting states in terms

of duty free access and much wider tariff concessions,

more flexibility in implementing trade liberalisation and

additional trade measures and other safeguards.

enhance tariff concessions at the second round on trade liberalisation. To accelerate the trade liberalisation process, the IGG favoured sectoral and across-the-board tariff reductions in addition to the product-by-product approach which appeared to be time consuming and cumbersome.

Recognising the significance of private sector participation in economic activities in a liberalised trading environment in most member countries, it was expected that close co-operation among the private sectors of the SAARC countries would be established and maintained. Consequently, a forum of leaders in the business communities of SAARC countries met in Colombo in August 1995. At this meeting, a decision was taken to set up committees to discuss sectoral issues as a framework for further negotiations. The responsibilities of each committee were assigned to individual member" countries to carry out further study and identify measures to be adopted for economic co-operation with the private sector. These will cover a wide spectrum of areas including agriculture (Bhutan), infrastructure and energy (Pakistan),

The member states initially agreed to proceed with trade liberalisation through'lowering or removal of tariffs, para tariffs and non-tariff barriers and to take other direct trade measures to promote mutual trade. At the end of the first round of trade negotiations, tariff concessions for 226 product categories (Table 2) were agreed upon. Although the progress achieved as at end 1995 was limited to tariff concessions for a limited number of products which covered around 1 per cent of the total trade of SAARC countries, further steps are to be taken to implement an accelerated process of trade liberalisation among the member slates with wider trade coverage. The Inter-Govemmental Group (IGG) on trade liberalisation of the SAPTA which met in December 1995 agreed to consider the removal of non-tariff and other trade barriers and

industry. (Bangladesh), investment and trade (Nepal), research and development (India), services (Sri Lanka) and tourism (the Maldives).

With the second round of negotiations of the IGG on trade liberalisation to be held in March 1996, deliberations were expected on modalities of implementing non-tariff, measures, simplification, harmonisation and streamlining of customs procedures, elimination of para tariff and non tariff restrictions within a specified time frame, widening of product coverage and deepening of tariff cuts. With progressive trade liberalisation among the SAPTA member countries it is anticipated that SAARC would be fxansformed into a Free Trade Area, preferably by the year 2000 but not later than 2005.

While trade among SAPTA member countries

accounts for only 3 per cent of their total trade (Table 3)

the importance of the SAPTA lies in the anticipated trade

liberalisation in member countries with a view to

promoting and expanding trade opportunities not only with

each other, but with non-member countries as well. In this

regard, while Sri Lanka currently has one of the most

liberalised trade regimes among SAPTA member countries,

it is expected that with regional co-operation under the

SAPTA, all member countries would move towards fully

liberalised trading systems in keeping with the objectives

of the final Uruguay Round reforms which are expected

to be implemented by the World Trade Organisation to

achieve a free global trading system.

deregulation and privatisation have improved conditions for

employment and growth and commended the efforts made

to further streamline the tax and tariff structure. The

Committee concluded that it was important for Sri Lanka to

continue with its liberalisation agenda, accept a higher level

of multilateral commitments and expeditiously implement

WTO provisions.

Sri Lanka also participated at the second round of the

Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP), which is the

first major proposal for intra-regional co-operation among

developing countries who are members of the Group of 77.

Sri Lanka has exchanged lists of requests and offers with

16 participating countries. Two sessions were held during

1995 and the negotiations are expected to be concluded by

March 1996 well in advance for UNCTAD IX which is

scheduled to be held in April 1996.

Sri Lanka continued to be a beneficiary of all schemes

under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) which

were in operation in 1995. There were 16 different schemes

of GSP which were implemented by 27 preference giving

countries including the USA, Japan and member countries

of the European Union (EU). The revised EU GSP Scheme

which came into force in January 1995 introduced new

features such as the graduation principle applicable to

developing countries, and special treatment to least developed

countries and countries involved in eradicating drug

trafficking. This scheme also dismantled all GSP quotas,

ceilings and maximum limits and transformed them into tariff. Manufactured products covered by the EU Scheme

have been categorised under 4 groups namely very sensitive,

sensitive, semi-sensitive and non-sensitive. The products

categorised as very sensitive include mainly textile products

and tariff concessions granted under the GSP Scheme to this

category have been reduced further. The Department of

Commerce made representations about possible adverse

effects on Sri Lanka of certain aspects of the new EU GSP

scheme.

Sri Lanka became a signatory to the International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA III) 1995, which could come into effect on or before January 1997. As in the previous agreement, natural rubber prices are to be stabilised through the operation of an international buffer-stock of 550,000 metric tons as the sole means of market intervention. Although Sri Lanka's total rubber production and its exports to the world market are relatively insignificant in influencing world market conditions, it was considered beneficial for Sri Lanka to be a participant in INRA III.

Sri Lanka became a founding member of the South

Asian Preferential Trading Agreement (SAPTA) which came

into force on 7 December 1995, following intensive rounds

of bilateral and multilateral negotiations. The SAPTA is

aimed at promoting and maintaining mutual trade and

economic co-operation among the contracting states of

SAARC through exchange of trade concessions. Sri Lanka

has offered concessions on 31 tariff lines in the Consolidated

National Schedules of Concessions which altogether cover

226 tariff lines (India 106, Pakistan 35, Sri Lanka 31,

Maldives 17, Nepal 14, Bangladesh 12 and Bhutan 11).

Sri Lanka continued to receive preferential treatment

from other member countries such as Bangladesh, India,

Laos and the Republic of Korea under the Bangkok

Agreement.

On a bilateral level, the fourth session of the Sri Lanka

- Maldives Joint Commission on Economic and Technical

Co-operation was held in Colombo at Ministerial level in

January 1995. The meeting focussed on enhanced

co-operation between the two countries in the areas of trade

and tourism, among others. Further, the Sub-Commission

on Trade, Finance and Investment between Sri Lanka and

India met in Colombo in February 1995. Bilateral

co-operation in the respective areas was reviewed and

decisions were taken towards facilitating trade flows and

investment. This subject was taken a step further when the

President and the Minister of Internal and External Trade,

Commerce and Food visited India and Bangladesh in March

1995. During these discussions, Sri Lanka secured tariff

concessions on a number of products of export interest. Sri

Lanka also ratified bilateral trade agreements with Kuwait

and Cyprus during 1995.

At a meeting held in Colombo in late 1995, the

members of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) agreed to

adopt a clearing mechanism for US dollar denominated

transactions under the ACU with effect from 1 January 1996

as the previous arrangement of clearing settlements only

through national currencies using the SDR for the conversion

rates appeared to hinder the growth of trade among ACU

members.

Capital Controls

The capital controls system remained unchanged in

1995. The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI)

continued to be the main authority responsible for foreign

investment in Sri Lanka while capital outflows came within

the purview of the Exchange Control Department. Foreign

investment upto 100 per cent of issued share capital is

allowed in most categories of investment. Certain other

categories provide for upto 40 per cent automatic approval,

while higher percentages may be approved on a case by case

basis by the BOI and other relevant authorities. A few

categories of investment continued to remain solely for Sri

112

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

Lankans. While capital outflows in the form of debt

repayments are freely allowed through Authorised Dealers,

foreign investment outflows were also allowed in 1995 on

a case by case basis. Accordingly, establishment of two new

bank branches by the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) in Madras and

Karachchi was permitted in 1995. The BOC also raised US

dollars 12 million through the issue of floating rate notes for

its FCBU operations.

9.12 Internal Trade

In 1995, internal trade policy focussed mainly on consumer protection. The Department of Internal Trade (DIT) carried out the functions of eliminating malpractices in trade and administering specified guidelines on quality standards. The DIT extended its services in dispute resolving procedures for those consumers affected by trade malpractices. Accordingly, 429 cases were resolved out of 867 complaints received during the year. In addition, the Department continued to assist the Ministry of Agricultural Development in enforcing the Fertiliser Act, in an effort to contain malpractices in the fertiliser trade.

Certain amendments to the Consumers Protection Act were introduced in 1995, with a view to eliminating practical difficulties in implementing the provisions specified in the Act. However, no new directions were issued under the Act.

In order to consolidate the present legislation with respect to the use and control of measurement, the "Standards and Services" Bill was passed in Parliament during the year. The Bill would create a legal framework for issuing legally recognisable calibration certificates to protect public health, environment, and security standards.

In addition to regulating trading activities through supervision and inspection, the DIT conducted several consumer awareness programmes for the general public and school children during 1995.

The Fair Trading Commission (FTC) continued its activities relating to investigating monopolies, mergers and anti-competitive practices and determining maximum retail prices for pharmaceutical items, which is the only product category currently subject to price controls. Meanwhile, the prices of 12 locally manufactured essential drugs were de-controlled with effect from December 1995, following a Cabinet directive.

The FTC investigated anti-competitive practices in the cement and salt trade and orders were issued under the Consumer Protection Act to minimise malpractices. In addition, price reviews were carried out under the Industrial Promotion Act, on soaps, toothpaste, magazines, milk powder

and biscuits, with a view to maintaining reasonable price levels in the market.

The Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) continued its importation, wholesale and retail sales of major food items and other consumables during 1995. In order to expand domestic sales of CWE packetted products, an islandwide Franchise Scheme was introduced in 1995 and 8,892 franchisees had been appointed as at end December 1995. The CWE maintained profitability of its importation and sales of big onions, potatoes and dried chillies, but in the face of competition from the private sector, its volume share of imports of big onions dropped from 27 per cent to 9 per cent while that of potatoes declined from 18 per cent to 8 per cent between 1994 and 1995. Meanwhile, its share of imports of red lentils rose from 35 per cent to 42 per cent. The CWE continued to operate as the sole importer of wheat grain in 1995. Inspite of the gradual reduction of the flour subsidy introduced in August 1994, the subsidy as at end 1995, amounted to Rs. 4.95 per kg on domestic wheat flour sales.1

The Commodity Purchases Department (CPD) continued to operate in the purchasing of sheet rubber from small holders. However, the Department purchased only a small percentage. These purchases helped the small holders to obtain remunerative prices as the Department announced producer prices for sheet rubber in line with international prices, which then operated as indicative prices for private dealers. In addition, the Department continued to distribute chemicals required for sheet rubber production.

9,13 Tourism

The Tourism sector suffered a major setback towards

the end of the year. Even after the resumption of terrorist

hostilities in April 1995 tourist arrivals increased by 5 per

cent until September 1995. However, escalation of hostilities

led to a 17 per cent drop in arrivals during the last quarter.

Total tourist arrivals dropped by 1 per cent for the year as

a whole. The gross earnings from tourism in 1995 recorded

an increase of 2 per cent in Rupee terms to Rs.l 1,569

million, while there was a drop of 7 per cent in SDR terms.

There was a significant drop in arrivals for business

purposes, partly reflecting the drop in foreign private

investment in 1995. Despite the drop in total arrivals the

number of tourists brought in by Air Lanka flights rose by

3 per cent as a result of the expansion of Air Lanka's fleet.

The number of hotel units in the graded accommodation

sector remained at the same level at 134 in 1995, while the

total room capacity increased marginally to 10,868. The data

on annual occupancy rate showed a drop from 56.6 per cent

in 1994 to 53.1 per cent in 1995, reducing the profitability

of the tourist hotel industry.

Meanwhile, following the growth in tourist arrivals and

associated economic activities in the past few years,

investment projects begun in 1994 in related sectors, such

as the hotel industry, continued into 1995.
