8. FISCAL POLICY AND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

8.1 Policy Strategy

Fiscal policy has been formulated within a medium-term

budgetary framework with a view to reducing the budget

deficit, consistent with macro economic objectives of

sustaining economic growth with price stability and external

viability. The medium-term budgetary framework which was

announced in the 1995 Budget placed emphasis on the

correction of structural weaknesses in government fiscal

operations. The medium-term fiscal adjustment efforts aim

at sustaining buoyant revenue growth, containing operational

expenditure and thereby preserving public investment while

reducing the overall budget deficit to ease pressure on

domestic borrowings. In this context, the 1995 Budget

anticipated a significant reduction in the fiscal imbalance -

turning the current account from a deficit to a surplus of 0.6

per cent of GDP, reducing the overall deficit from 10 per

cent of GDP in 1994 to 7.5 per cent in 1995 and reducing

bank financing by Rs.7,405 million or by 1.1 per cent of

GDP.

The Government adopted several fiscal measures during

1995 in order to reduce the budget deficit. On the revenue

front, the lower rate band of turnover tax, excise tax on

petrol and consumer durables, the defence levy and Customs

duty on motor vehicles were raised and an excise tax on

diesel was introduced. The tax base in respect of Customs

duty was strengthened by rationalising ad hoc duty waivers.

.Revenue collection from the defence levy was streamlined

at the point of Customs. A new tax on diesel motor vehicles,

other than those used for public transport, was imposed to

recover the implicit price subsidy on diesel, while a further

levy was imposed on luxury motor vehicles to place a tax

burden on the relatively affluent in society. In order to

sustain a high non-tax revenue effort, administrative fees and

charges were raised. A levy on selected commercial public

enterprises was also imposed.

On the expenditure side, in addition to a restraint on

operational expenditures of the Government, a 10 per cent

cut was imposed on the purchases of goods and services and

low priority capital expenditure programmes such as

purchases of vehicles and equipment and renovation of

buildings. Welfare expenditure was targeted and the

administrative price of wheat flour was adjusted in order to

contain an emerging large subsidy on wheat flour.

The fiscal policy strategy also incorporated several vital structural reforms in respect of Customs tariffs, excise taxation, public enterprise reform and government welfare

programmes. In addition to a restriction on the use of duty waivers, Customs tariffs were converted to an ad valorem basis, except on crude oil. The highest standard rate of 45 per cent was reduced to 35 per cent and Customs duty on several items was brought down to a standard three band rate structure of 10, 20 and 35 per cent.

A comprehensive reform in respect of excise taxation was introduced towards the end of the year with the removal of a large number of items from such taxation, improving tax administration and reducing the high tax burden on domestic industries. The prohibitive excise tax on beer was reduced with a view to improving investment in the local beer industry. Separate taxes on processed tobacco and cigarettes were unified into a single stage excise on the sale of cigarettes in order to simplify and improve tax administration.

With a view to encouraging capital infusion, revitalising the role of private sector in strategic enterprises and improving the fiscal situation, the Government re-organised the programme of public enterprise reforms covering enterprises in infrastructure, plantations and commercial activity. Institutional arrangements to undertake such reforms in an orderly manner were set in place with the task force on public enterprise reform being converted into a Public Enterprise Reform Commission by statute.

Reform on the fiscal front also concentrated on government welfare programmes. Recognising the importance of having a well targeted programme for poverty alleviation, the Government introduced a new programme, named Samurdhi, in place of the food and kerosene stamp schemes, the school mid-day meal and the Janasaviya programmes. This programme targeted about 1.2 million families outside the Northern and Eastern provinces for direct assistance from the Government.

8.2 Budget Out-turn

The fiscal operations in 1995 made significant progress

towards fiscal consolidation. The current account deficit

dropped to 1.5 per cent of GDP in 1995 from 2.9 per cent

in the previous year. The overall budget deficit dropped from

10 per cent of GDP in 1994 to 8.4 per cent of GDP in 1995.

Under the impact of various policy reforms and with a

buoyant revenue growth witnessed in personal income tax

and taxes on domestic goods and services, together with

levies on selected public enterprises, government revenue

increased to 20.6 per cent of GDP in 1995 from 19 per cent

Subsidies as a Social Safety Net

Box 4

Improving the quality of life through high and sustained economic growth with equity is the ultimate .goal of economic policy. The benefits of economic growth are expected to trickle down to all groups including the poorest segments of society. However, there are imperfections in the trickle down process and some segments of the population are sometimes deprived of the benefits. Therefore, governments have a moral responsibility to safeguard the interests of such groups. In Sri Lanka, the provision of assistance to the poor and the weak through subsidies has been high on the agenda of all governments.

People who deserve welfare assistance can be grouped into two categories, namely, (i) the 'permanently poor', i.e., the dependent population including the aged, the chronically ill, the invalid, the disabled, orphans and children deprived of family care and (ii) the 'temporary poor', i.e., people who are economically employable, but are below the poverty line due to various reasons. Social welfare schemes should be targeted to provide the assistance required by these two groups. A permanent welfare programme is necessary for the first category. The poverty of the second group, however, is best addressed by policies and programmes which promote income opportunities for the poor.

Relief measures such as the food subsidy scheme and the rice ration scheme provided by the colonial government during the second world war had a direct impact on the policies; of post-Independence governments in Sri Lanka. This role of helping the needy in times of insecurity has been largely misunderstood by society. It was interpreted as a compulsory 'generosity' of the Government and became an integral part of development programmes. This forced post-Independence governments: to provide extensive welfare services such as subsidies on : essential food items (mainly rice), free education; free health services and subsidised public transport indiscriminately to all groups. However, these policies were effective in enhancing living standards. Sri Lanka has achieved a high rating on most social indicators, particularly in the fields of education and health, superior to most of her Asian neighbours, although the country's economic growth has not been impressive; Meanwhile, ever increasing costs of the indiscriminate provision of welfare services to an ever-growing population imposed a considerable strain on successive government budgets and eroded budgetary resources, thus crowding out investment and growth.

With the shift to open economic policies in the late 1970s, the distortions created by price subsidies were

removed to allow markets to operate efficiently. One major feature of government expenditure policy was to rationalise welfare expenditure while safeguarding the poor through targeted subsidies and income transfer programmes. By 1986, welfare programmes had been streamlined. This included better targeting of food stamps, kerosene stamps, school season tickets, mid-day meals and free text books for school children as well as the infant milk food subsidy. Gradually, however, the safety net was indiscriminately widened again to cover items such as free uniforms to all school children, and recently, wheat flour and bread subsidies to the entire population.

The introduction of a generalised wheat flour subsidy in 1994 reduced the cost of living of low income groups, but led to a number of other complications. It deviated from the concept of targeted subsidy schemes and, once again, transformed the entire population into passive recipients of a subsidy. In fact, the composition of wheat flour consumers indicates that a large share of the subsidy benefits people in high income groups. Moreover, this subsidy distorted relative prices against rice and other food crops. In addition, the sustainability of this scheme has now been threatened due to resource constraints, creating the need for immediate corrective action. The gradual removal of the subsidy began in late 1995 and is now in progress. The direct cost of this subsidy amounted to Rs.5,000 million in 1995.

Poor targeting and resource limitations have threatened the sustainability of many welfare programmes, while their real benefits have eroded over time. Moreover, the open ended nature of some of these welfare schemes distorted resource allocation, while affecting the labour market as well. Therefore, government intervention began to focus more recently on improving the efficiency of welfare programmes through better targeting as well as encouraging the active participation of people in such programmes with the objective of improving their income generating opportunities. This was the theme of the Janasaviya programme launched in late 1989 and the Samurdhi programme introduced in 1996. These schemes were expected to link the poor to the production process by providing enhanced access to basic facilities. Their targeting was also improved through a social screening process. The Janasaviya and Samurdhi programmes have also shown that the impact of pressure groups can be minimised through such a social screening system. These programmes are consistent with the policy of assisting the 'temporary poor' by providing them with income opportunities to rise above the poverty line, the ultimate objective of the social safety net.

in 1994. However, the full impact of several new measures

did not reflect in government revenue efforts due to a delay

in implementation. In the wake of the escalation of defence

and security related expenditure, enhanced cost of salaries

and pensions to government employees, higher outlays on

food subsidies and a sustained interest burden of domestic

debt, the current expenditure remained around 22 per cent

of GDP as in the previous year. Consequently, the current

account of the budget was in deficit to the value of 1.5 per

cent of GDP.

However.even with a current account deficit and public

investment of 7.9 per cent of GDP, the Government was able

to contain the overall budget deficit at 8.4 per cent of GDP

in 1995 due to inflows on account of public enterprise

reforms and receipts of past on-lending to commercial

enterprises of the Government.

Although both the current account deficit and the overall

budget deficit were lower than the previous year's deficits

of 2.9 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, the performance

was below expectations. It is important to note that the

primary deficit (the deficit net of interest payments) declined

from 3.4 per cent of GDP in 1994 to 2.6 per cent of GDP

in 1995, while the deficit excluding defence expenditure

declined from 5.4 per cent to 3.2 per cent, underscoring the

pressure from high domestic debt and defence expenditure

on the country's fiscal operations. The deficit excluding the

proceeds from public enterprise reforms declined from 10.5

per cent of GDP to 8.9 per cent of GDP.

The use of foreign grants and concessionary aid decreased from 3.4 per cent of GDP in 1994 to 3.3 per cent in 1995 and net domestic financing of the budget deficit declined from 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1994 to 5.1 per cent in 1995. However, the target of reducing bank financing by Rs. 7,405 million was not achieved. Instead, bank financing increased by Rs. 7,065 million or by 1.1 per cent of GDP.

The domestic resource needs of the Government were largely

met through non-bank market borrowings. The balance of

payments deficit and sustained high credit demand from the

private sector led to a tight liquidity situation and sharp rise

in Treasury bill rates and other interest rates towards end

1995. In this context, the Government resorted to increased

bank financing through the sale of Treasury bills to the

Central Bank. Hence, budgetary operations exerted an

expansionary impact on money supply, which remained high

during the year.

8.3 Revenue and Grants

In 1995, government revenue amounted to Rs. 136,258

million, recording an increase of 24 per cent compared with

the growth of 12 per cent in the previous year. Tax revenue

totaling Rs. 118,543 million showed an increase of 19 per

cent and as a proportion of GDP, increased from 17.2 per

cent in 1994 to 17.9 per cent. All major sources of taxes,

such as turnover tax on imports, defence levy, excise taxes,

import duty and income taxes, contributed to sustain the

buoyant growth in tax revenue. Non-tax revenue too marked

a substantial increase of 67 per cent, under the impact of

levies imposed on selected commercial public enterprises.

Tax Revenue

Reflecting an increased reliance on taxes on domestic goods and services such as the defence levy, excise tax and turnover taxes in the tax structure, the share of revenue from taxes on goods and services rose from 57 per cent in 1994 to 60 per cent in 1995. The revenue from this source registered a sharp rise of 25 per cent in comparison to a growth of 18 per cent in the previous year and accounted for 10.7 per cent of GDP.

The defence levy, which is imposed on all goods other than exports and on selected services, generated Rs. 14,408 million (2.2 per cent of GDP), recording a 49 per cent increase in 1995. This significant improvement was attributable to an increase in the defence levy from 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent in June 1995 and to the imposition of this levy in respect of imports at the point of Customs instead of the previous practice of collecting this levy from banks when Letters of Credit were opened.

Revenue from turnover taxes at Rs.36,429 million sustained a growth of 13 per cent in 1995 largely due to a buoyant revenue growth from turnover tax on imports and an increase in the lowest tax band from 5 per cent to 6 per cent in February 1995. In spite of a slower growth in dutiable imports and a reduction in Customs duties, turnover tax on imports at Rs. 19,449 million recorded an increase of 17 per cent compared to a 7 per cent increase in the

previous year largely due to the rationalisation of tax

exemptions and duty waivers in February 1995. Revenue

collection from turnover tax on manufacturing at Rs.9,906

million was an increase of 8 per cent in comparison to a

decline of 1 per cent observed in 1994. The revenue on

account of turnover tax from the non-manufacturing sector

at Rs.7,074 million showed an increase of 10 per cent in

comparison to a growth of 34 per cent in the previous year.

Excise taxes yielded Rs. 19,436 million, registering an

increase of 33 per cent. They accounted for 16 per cent of

tax revenue. As a proportion of GDP, they rose from 2.5

per cent in 1994 to 2.9 per cent in 1995. Excise taxes on

liquor at Rs.6,298 million showed an increase of 34 per cent,

reflecting the upward revision of excise duty on liquor by

Rs. 17.80 per proof litre for arrack and Rs.25.90 per proof

litre for locally manufactured foreign type spirits in January

1995 and increased liquor production by 9 per cent. Excise

taxes on processed tobacco and cigarettes at Rs.8,788 million

grew by 11 per cent due to the increase in the excise tax

on cigarettes and the increase in the production of tobacco

and cigarettes by 3 per cent. Meanwhile, the increase in the

excise tax on petrol (from Rs.2 to Rs.7 per litre), the

imposition of an excise duty of Re.l per litre on diesel and

the increase of the excise duty rates on selected consumer

83

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

durables in February 1995, enhanced the revenue collection by Rs.2,292 million to Rs.4,350 million in 1995. Excise taxes were rationalised in November 1995. In addition, separate excise taxes on processed tobacco and cigarettes were unified, according to international practice.

this new tax on motor vehicles, an annual tax of Rs.25,000-

Rs.50,000 per vehicle was levied on luxury vehicles while

an annual tax of Rs.5,000- Rs.l0,000 was imposed on diesel

vehicles other than lorries and those used for public

transport and agriculture.

In spite of the lowering of the maximum tariff from 45

per cent to 35 per cent, the exemption of essential food items

such as lentils and dried fish, the continuation of

concessionary rates in respect of milk powder, sugar, cement

and yarn and a slower growth of imports, the revenue from

import duties at Rs. 24,365 million recorded an increase of

8 per cent. However, in relation to GDP, it declined from

3.9 per cent in 1994 to 3.7 per cent in 1995. The tariffs on

imports were rationalised within a three band rate structure

consisting of 10, 20 and 35 per cent. However, liquor,

tobacco, passenger cars and certain luxury items were

excluded from this revision on social and equity grounds.

The import tariff reform together with a slower growth of

imports, resulted in the import duties applicable to a wide

range of commodities such as textile fabrics, agricultural

machinery, implements and tools, vehicles used for public

transportation, bicycles, parts and accessories of motor

vehicles, which were earlier liable for higher rates of 35-45

per cent, being classified under the lower rates of 20-35 per

cent.

Revenue from taxes on personal and corporate income

at Rs. 17,161 million accounted for 14 per cent of tax

revenue. The income tax to GDP ratio remained unchanged

at 2.6 per cent as in the previous year. In spite of an

increase of the tax free income threshold to Rs.60,000 and

a higher provision of Rs.l5,700 tax credit for employment

income as against a threshold income of Rs.42,000 and

employment tax credit of Rs.6,000 in 1994, personal income

tax collection in 1995, at Rs.7,358 million, witnessed an

increase of 31 per cent. Revenue from corporate income

taxes rose to Rs.9,803 million reflecting a marginal increase

of 2 per cent.

Stamp duties at Rs.5,162 million showed an increase of 18 per cent in 1995. With a view to generating a buoyant revenue growth, stamp duties on receipts were placed on a sliding scale based on the value of transactions from November 1995. As a result of the increased stock of Treasury bill holdings by the Central Bank, taxes on the interest on Treasury bills held by the Central Bank generated a revenue of Rs. 1,050 million. Meanwhile, license fees increased from Rs.60 million in 1994 to Rs.524 million in

1995, a sum of Rs.167 million being collected through the luxury motor vehicle and private diesel vehicle taxes which came into effect from April 1995, but were implemented in September 1995. Therefore, the full impact of this revenue measure was not felt in the 1995 budgetary out-turn. Under

contributed to sustaining high non-tax revenue in 1995.

Revenue from fees and charges increased from Rs.988

million in 1994 to Rs.l,751 million in 1995 following the

increase of fees and charges on services rendered by

Government departments by 20 per cent with effect from

January 1995. Fees and charges in respect of resident visas

and passports were also raised in November 1995. Interest

receipts were Rs.6,946 million in 1995 as against Rs.4,560

million in 1994. Other sub-income categories such as rent,

fines and forfeitures indicated marginal improvements over

the previous year. In relation to GDP non-tax revenue

increased to 2.7 per cent from 1.8 per cent in 1994.

Foreign Grants

The utilisation of foreign grants for budgetary purposes

during 1995 at Rs.9,028 million registered an increase of 9

per cent. Consequently, total foreign grants in relation to

GDP remained at 1.4 per cent in 1995 as in the previous

year. Japan and the USA continued to be the largest donors

providing 64 per cent of total grants to Sri Lanka. Out of

total grants, Rs.5,980 million were on account of the Public

Investment Programme.

8.4 Expenditure

Total government expenditure and net lending at

Rs.l91,568 million in 1995 showed an increase of 14 per

cent. However, total expenditure as a proportion of GDP

declined marginally from 29 per cent in 1994 to 28.9 per

cent in 1995. Current expenditure at Rs.146,061 million

accounted for 76 per cent of total government expenditure

while the balance 24 per cent was capital expenditure and

net lending. Meanwhile, public investment, which consisted

of capital expenditure and on-lending to public enterprises

funded through the government budget, stood at Rs.51,994

million, accounting for 7.9 per cent of GDP in 1995.

Current Expenditure

Current expenditure in 1995 at Rs.146,061 million was

an increase of 15 per cent. As a percentage of GDP it rose

marginally from 22 per cent in 1994 to 22.1 per cent in

1995.

The level of current expenditure of the Government

underscored the serious short-term constraints in fiscal

adjustments. Personnel emoluments and pension payments to

government employees accounted for more than one third of

current expenditure and absorbed nearly 38 per cent of

government revenue in 1995. Following successive high

budget deficits in recent years, public debt has risen to 95

per cent of GDP and interest payments accounted for a

Chart 8.3

Composition of Expenditure -1990 and 1995

n Other Current D Capital S3 Net Lending £SI Current Transfers Q interest O Salaries

fourth of current expenditure and used nearly 28 per cent

of government revenue. In the context of high outlays on

personnel emoluments, pensions and interest payments on

public debt, the burden of fiscal adjustments towards a lower

budget deficit falls on important public expenditure

programmes such as maintenance of public assets and public

investment. In addition it calls for a higher revenue effort.

In the wake of a spillover impact of ad hoc wage

increases granted during 1994 and the establishment of a

teachers' service with new salary scales in 1995, the wage

bill of the Government at Rs.36,346 million, showed an

increase of Rs.7,037 million during the year. The impact of

the implementation of the new salary scale for the teachers'

service amounted to about Rs.3,000 million. Moreover, the

correction of salary anomalies of selected categories of public

86

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

servants on an ad hoc basis, the recruitment of around 650

graduate trainees and the grant of permanent status to casual

employees in various government departments effected

during 1994 also contributed to an enhanced wage bill in

1995. Expenditure on salaries and wages accounted for one

fourth of current expenditure and stood at around 5.5 per

cent of GDP in 1995.

Pension payments, which rose by 13 per cent in 1995,

amounted to Rs.l5,057 million. This increase was partly due

to the grant of an overdue cost of living allowance of Rs.260

for pensioners. The total number of pensioners also continued

to grow, from about 330,000 in 1994 to 342,000 in 1995.

Expenditure incurred by the Government in procuring

various goods and services including electricity,

communication, travelling, supplies of office requisites and

defence requirements rose to Rs.31,002 million indicating an

increase of 22 per cent over that of 1994. The enhancement

on account of these outlays was mainly due to increased

defence expenditure, following the resumption of hostilities

in April 1995. The share of defence related expenditure in

this category accounted for Rs.22,460 million or 72 per cent

and reflected the heavy burden of defence expenditure on

fiscal operations. However, due to stringent measures taken

to contain operational expenditure, costs of non-defence

expenditure on other goods and services declined from

Rs.10,172 million in 1994 to Rs.8,542 million in 1995.

Interest payments on public debt amounted to Rs.38,226

million or 5.8 per cent of GDP in 1995. Domestic interest

payments dropped marginally from Rs. 32,520 million in

1994 to Rs.32,064 million in 1995. Interest on Treasury bills

dropped by 25 per cent due to the lagged effect of lower

Treasury bill rates experienced in 1994 and the first four

months of 1995 as against the high rates that prevailed in

1993. In contrast, interest payments on Rupee loans rose

from Rs.13,808 million in 1994 to Rs.18,117 million in 1995

reflecting the impact of large borrowings made during the

period July 1994 to June 1995, totaling Rs.40,168 million.

The interest on foreign debt increased from Rs.5,511 million

in 1994 to Rs.6,162 million in 1995. However, the average

interest rate on foreign loans was around 1.8 per cent in

1995, as in the previous year, reflecting the concessional

nature of foreign debt.

Transfers to public corporations and institutions increased from Rs.4,610 million to Rs. 10,023 million, mainly due to a payment of Rs.5,000 million to the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) to meet the cost of the flour subsidy. The high level of expenditure on the flour subsidy resulted from increased consumption of flour together with a sharp rise in the average price (C & F price) of wheat grain from US dollars 136 per metric ton in 1994 to US

dollars 185 per metric ton in 1995. The wheat flour subsidy,

which was Rs.0.22 per kg in August 1994, rose drastically

in 1995 in spite of an increase in the administrative price

of wheat flour from Rs.6.65 per kg to Rs.l 1.15 per kg. On

average, the wheat flour subsidy remained at Rs.9.02 per kg

during the year. Reflecting the effect of the large price

subsidy, flour issues by the Food Commissioner's Department

rose by 10 per cent while total wheat imports increased by

22 per cent between these two years.

Transfer payments on account of the operational losses

of the Government Railways remained virtually unchanged

while those of the Postal Department dropped due to the

increase in postal rates during 1995. The operational losses

of railways continued to remain due to non-adjustment in

fares. Welfare expenditure on multiple programmes such as

food and kerosene stamps, the Janasaviya and Samurdhi

Programmes, free school uniforms, free mid-day meal, season

tickets, free text books, infant milk food subsidy and

Thriposha care totalled Rs.10,580 million or 1.6 per cent of

GDP. The expenditure for providing emergency relief to

affected families and rehabilitation of displaced persons in

the Northern and Eastern provinces was Rs.2,106 million.

The fertiliser subsidy, which was reintroduced in October

1994, amounted to Rs.1,345 million. However, the three

main welfare programmes namely, Janasaviya, food and

kerosene stamps and school mid-day meal programme, were

consolidated with the introduction of the Samurdhi

Programme.

On a functional basis, current expenditure on social

services, which includes education, health, welfare and

community services, increased by 21 per cent to Rs.57,648

million in 1995, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of total

current expenditure. As a share of GDP it increased from

8.2 per cent in 1994 to 8.7 per cent in 1995. Expenditure

on education increased by 6 per cent over that of the

previous year, due largely to the teachers' salary revisions

in 1995, while expenditure on health increased to Rs.8,818

million in 1995 in comparison to Rs.7,666 million in 1994.

Current expenditure on economic services, which included operational expenditure incurred by government institutions mainly on agriculture and irrigation, fisheries, manufacturing and mining, energy and water supply, transport and communications and trade and commerce amounted to Rs.8,078 million - an increase of 30 per cent over the amount utilised in 1994. This was largely due to the full year impact of the fertiliser subsidy.

Current outlays on public administration and defence at

Rs.39,986 million, showed an increase of 31 per cent over

the previous year. This was mainly reflected in the increased

expenditure on defence related activities, which grew from

Rs.25,807 million in 1994 to Rs.33,424 million in 1995. This

source of expenditure itself accounted for more than one fifth

of total current expenditure and was 5.0 per cent of GDP.

Public Investment

Lanka Ports Authority (Rs.5,943 million), Road Development

Authority (Rs.4,927 million), National Water Supply and

Drainage Board (Rs.3,156 million), Mahaweli Authority of

Sri Lanka (Rs.3,090 million) and Sri Lanka Telecom

(Rs.2,360 million).

Public investment, which consisted of Rs.40,907 million

on account of capital expenditure and Rs. 11,087 million on

account of on lending to public corporations, amounted to

Rs.51,994 million or 7.9 per cent of GDP. Capital

expenditure directly incurred by ministries and departments

under the Public Investment Programme (PIP) for

construction and development of fixed assets stood at

Rs.21,908 million in 1995 in comparison to Rs. 16,747

million in 1994. Public investment projects undertaken by

public corporations and statutory bodies used Rs.29,147

million - an increase of 28 per cent over the previous year.

Of these funds, Rs. 19,476 million was utilised by the Sri

Capital expenditure incurred by public corporations and

institutions by way of resources mobilised through on

lending, was at Rs. 11,087 million, lower than the budget

estimate of Rs. 13,761 million for 1995. Of the budgetary

provision of Rs.4,335 million to be fully funded by foreign

aid for the power distribution and transmission project of the

Ceylon Electricity Board, only Rs. 1,482 million was utilised.

Similarly, of Rs.3,501 million provided for the

Telecommunication Development Project, Sri Lanka Telecom

utilised only Rs. 2,360 million. These shortfalls were mainly

due to implementation and procedural delays. However, Sri

Lanka Ports Authority utilised Rs.5,943 million - more than

the budgetary allocation, which was largely foreign funded,

for the development of port facilities.

In terms of functional classification, public investment

for development of economic services amounted to Rs.36,106

million (5.5 per cent of GDP). Of this amount, Rs.18,888

million or 52 per cent was on account of the transport and

communications sector of which, Rs.4,927 million was

utilised for the development of the road network. The Sri

Lanka Port Authority and Sri Lanka Telecom used Rs.5,943

million and Rs.2,360 million. Out of Rs.6,060 million spent

on agriculture and irrigation, 51 per cent was utilised by the

Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka. Public investment in

energy and water supply stood at Rs.5,003 million, which

was 37 per cent lower than the original resource allocation

for the development of this sector. This reduction was mainly

due to the under-utilisation of funds allocated for the CEB

under the on lending programme. Capital expenditure on

account of social services increased by 28 per cent to

Rs.9,854 million in 1995. Out of the five sectors in social

services, four sectors, namely, education, health, housing and

community services experienced substantial increases in

public investment. Welfare services witnessed only a

marginal increase. As a proportion of GDP, public

investment in social services rose from 1.3 per cent in 1994

to 1.5 per cent in 1995. Total capital investment in general

administration, at Rs.5,096 million, represented 0.8 per cent

of GDP.

8.5 Public Enterprise Reforms

The Public Enterprise Reform Programme generated Rs.3,001 million. The Government completed the divestiture of a few key commercial enterprises such as Colombo Gas Company, attracting foreign capital and technology. Total revenue raised from the Colombo Gas Company transaction amounted to US dollars 37 million (Rs. 1,998 million). In addition, Capital Development Investment Company Ltd. and several plantation companies were also divested during the year. The Public Enterprise Reform Commission also initiated restructuring of Air Lanka, Sri Lanka Telecom, Orient Lanka Limited, Sevanagala Sugar, Lanka Electric Company and several other small enterprises. Recoveries from past on - lending by the Government totalled Rs.5,097 million of which Rs. 1,420 million was paid by the CEB. Annual interest payments on Government bonds held by the two state banks in respect of their restructuring programme amounted to Rs. 2,891 million.

8.6 Financing the Budget Deficit

The budget deficit (after grants), at Rs. 46,282 million

in 1995, marked a decline of 6 per cent or Rs.3,191 million

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

over that of 1994. Gross foreign resources available for

financing the deficit amounted to Rs.20,787 million, an

increase of 7 per cent. However, net borrowings from foreign

sources amounted to Rs.12,310 million due to a repayment

of Rs. 8,477 million. Moreover, it is notable that gross

foreign borrowings were 21 per cent below the level

expected in the budget due to project implementation delays,

particularly in the case of the power and telecommunication

projects which were foreign funded. Net foreign borrowings

as a proportion of GDP stood at 1.9 per cent in 1995.

Gross borrowings for budgetary purposes from non-bank

domestic sources through the issue of Rupee loans.Treasury

bills and administrative arrangements amounted to Rs.55,075

million as compared to Rs.52,051 million in the previous

year. The Government mobilised gross borrowings of

Rs.46,715 million through the issue of Rupee securities. The

borrowings through this source in 1994 were Rs.46,878

million. However, due to repayments of Rs. 26,329 million,

net borrowing through the Rupee Loan Programme amounted

to Rs.20,386 million as against Rs. 31,922 million in 1994.

As in the previous year, the Employees' Provident Fund

(EPF) continued to be the major subscriber to the Rupee loan

programme. Subscriptions from this source to Rupee loans

in 1995, at Rs.31,420 million, showed an increase of 24 per

cent or Rs.6,068 million. In contrast, total subscriptions by

the National Savings Bank (NSB) to the Rupee loan

programme declined from Rs.19,595 million in 1994 to

Rs. 14,429 million in 1995, as a result of a shift from Rupee

loans to Treasury bills due to the higher yield on the latter.

However, during 1995 the NSB accounted for more than 30

per cent of the total subscriptions to the Rupee loans

programme. During 1995, the interest rate on Rupee loans

remained at 14 per cent, while the yield on Treasury bills

with one year maturity fluctuated between 13.68 and 20.54

per cent. Resources utilised through Treasury bills amounted

to Rs.9,755 million. In financing the budget deficit, the

Government also utilised Rs.53 million through Treasury

Certificates of Deposits (TCD) and Rs.548 million through

administrative arrangements.

With a repayment of Rs.28,069 million, net domestic borrowings from non-bank domestic sources amounted to Rs.26,359 million in 1995 in comparison to Rs.37,205 million in 1994. Consequently, domestic non-bank financing in relation to GDP declined from 6.3 per cent in 1994 to 4.1 per cent in 1995. Thus, the budget deficit (after grants), which was 7 per cent of GDP, was financed by foreign financing - 1.9 per cent of GDP and domestic non-bank sources - 4.1 per cent of GDP, leaving a balance to be financed through the banking system. Hence, bank financing in relation to GDP increased from 0.2 per cent in 1994 to 1.1 per cent in 1995, exerting pressure on money supply.

1993

Year

The Government borrowed Rs. 8,760 million from the Central Bank. This consisted of Rs. 7,426 million mobilised through Treasury bills and Rs. 1,334 million on account of provisional advances. When the buildup of government cash balances with the Central Bank at Rs. 227 million and the reduction in the cash items in the process of collection by Rs.871 million were taken into account, net credit to the Government by the Central Bank amounted to Rs.7,662 million in 1995, contributing to an expansion of reserve money (high powered money) in the economy. In spite of increased holdings of government import bills (Rs.2,548 million), overdrafts to the Government (Rs. 379 million) and cash items in the process of collection (Rs. 856 million), net credit to the Government by commercial banks declined by Rs.597 million due to the reduction in holdings of Treasury bills and government securities in commercial bank portfolios (Rs.4,186 million) and a deposit build up (Rs. 194 million). Therefore, overall fiscal operations during 1995 resulted in an increase in net credit to the Government from the banking system by Rs.7,065 million.

8.7 Government Debt

Government debt at the end of 1995 at Rs.631,593

million increased by 15 per cent. Accordingly, the

% of GDP 100r

Chart 8JS Composition of Debt

government debt to GDP ratio continued to remain at the

previous year's level of 95 cent. Domestic debt accounted

for 45 per cent of total debt while the balance 55 per cent

was on account of foreign debt.

Domestic Debt

The domestic debt, which accounted for 45 per cent of

the total outstanding debt, increased by 15 per cent to

Rs.285,759 million at end 1995. In 1994, the domestic debt

stock increased by 17 per cent over that of the previous year.

Of the total domestic debt Rs. 127,471 million or 45 per cent

was short-term debt with maturities of one year or less.

During the year under review, short-term debt increased by

17 per cent in comparison to the growth rate of 7 per cent

observed in 1994. The higher increase in 1995 was

attributable to increased borrowing through Treasury bills to

finance the shortfall in the government cash flow. The

outstanding liability on account of Treasury bills accounted

for 89 per cent of the total short-term debt. The total value

of Treasury bills outstanding rose from Rs.98,896 million at

the end of 1994 to Rs.l 13,771 million at end 1995. This was

the net outcome of new issues of Treasury bills amounting

to Rs.l6,475 million and repayments at Rs.l,600 million

during 1995. In 1994, the Government raised only Rs. 1,700

million through new issues of Treasury bills for budgetary

purposes. The authorised limit of Treasury bills remained

unchanged at Rs.125,000 million since 16 December 1992.

Central Bank provisional advances, which accounted for the

balance 11 per cent of the short-term debt of the

Government, increased by Rs. 1,334 million to Rs.l3,700

million at end 1995.

Medium and long-term debt, at Rs.l58,289 million, increased by 13 per cent in comparison to a rate of increase of 26 per cent in 1994. In value terms, the increase in medium and long-term debt was Rs. 17,896 million. However, the Government domestic debt stock indicated a shift towards short-term debt, as the share of medium and long-term debt decreased from 56 per cent in 1994 to 55 per cent in 1995. This was a reversal of a trend observed since 1993 as the proportions of medium and long-term debt increased from 42 per cent in 1992 to 52 per cent in 1993 and further to 56 per cent in 1994. With the repayment of medium-term Treasury bill holdings of Rs.2,536 million which were in the domestic debt portfolio in 1994, almost the entirety of medium and long-term debt in 1995 consisted of Rupee loans.

As the bulk of the domestic debt was mobilised through

the issue of Rupee loans, the outstanding liability on account

of this debt instrument increased by 15 per cent over

Rs.l37,554 million, the amount outstanding at the end of the

previous year. Under the Rupee Loan Programme for 1995,

Part 1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 1995

which commenced in January 1995, Rs.46,715 million was

raised through the flotation of 10 series of loans. These loans

carried an interest rate of 14 per cent per annum and

optional maturity periods of 5-6 years and 5-7 years.

Furthermore, Rupee loans amounting to Rs.26,329 million

were repaid during the year. As a result, net resources

mobilised through the Rupee Loan Programme amounted to

Rs.20,386 million, resulting in an outstanding Rupee loan

liability of Rs. 157,928 million at end 1995. This included

Rs.24,088 million of long-term bonds (30 year maturity)

issued under the restructuring programme of Bank of Ceylon

and People's Bank. The EPF and NSB continued to be the

two main subscribers to the Rupee loan programme,

accounting for 81 per cent of the total outstanding Rupee

loans at end 1995. During the year under review, almost the

entirety of the outstanding Rupee securities, excluding long-

term bonds amounting to Rs. 24,088 million, was held by

the non-bank sector.

The outstanding liability on account of Treasury

Certificates of Deposits (TCD), although relatively

insignificant in the debt portfolio of the Government,

increased from Rs. 145 million at end 1994 to Rs. 200

million at end 1995. The TCDs were issued for maturity

periods of 6 and 12 months at yield rates of 17.15 and 18.06

per cent, respectively. The total rupee liability on account

of foreign administrative borrowings amounted to Rs. 153

million while the liability on Tax Reserve Certificates (TRC)

remained negligible at Rs. 7 million, as at end 1995.

Foreign Debt

The total foreign debt outstanding at end 1995

amounted to Rs. 345,834 million, representing an increase

of Rs.44,022 million or 15 per cent over the previous year.

The increase in foreign debt was inclusive of net borrowing

of Rs. 15,335 million and an additional liability of Rs.28,687

million arising from the movements of exchange rates.

Foreign debt accounted for 55 per cent of total government

debt as in the previous year.

The outstanding liability on account of concessional loans amounted to Rs.335,595 million - an increase of Rs.43,132 million oyer the previous year. This increase resulted from foreign assistance of Rs.22,634 million received on concessional terms, repayment of Rs.7,161 million and an additional liability of Rs.27,660 million on account of exchange rate variations. However, the share of concessional loans in foreign debt remained at 97 per cent as in 1994. Bilateral loans constituted Rs. 190,960 million or 57 per cent of concessional loans, while the balance Rs. 144,635 million had been obtained through multilateral agreements. The outstanding liability in respect of foreign loans obtained on a commercial basis amounted to Rs. 10,239 million.

Liability on account of project and programme loans,

at Rs.286,515 million, was an increase of Rs. 40,440 million

over the level recorded in 1994. This was the net outcome

of inflows of Rs. 22,246 million, repayment of Rs. 5,552

million and increase in the outstanding liability by Rs.

23,745 due to exchange rate variations. The outstanding

liability on account of commodity loans rose to Rs.57,715

million, resulting from a net repayment of Rs. 1,251 million

and a liability of Rs.4,819 million caused by fluctuations in

the exchange rates. Approximately 95 per cent of the project

and programme loans were obtained from bilateral and

multilateral sources while the entirety of commodity loans

was from bilateral sources.

Government Debt Service Payments

The debt service payments of the Government, at Rs. 74,772 million, which consisted of Rs.36,546 million of amortisation payments and Rs.38,226 million of interest payments, increased by 23 per cent over the previous year. Debt service payment as a ratio of GDP increased from 10.5 per cent in 1994 to 11.3 per cent in 1995, largely due to a high volume of maturing of domestic debt on account of Rupee loans, totaling Rs.26,329 million.

amounting to Rs.l,600 million, stood at Rs.28,069 million in 1995. The repayment of foreign loans in 1995 amounted to Rs. 8,477 million. Of this, repayment of Rs.5,552 million was on account of project and programme loans, while Rs.2,781 million was on account of commodity loans .

cent of government revenue, imposing a heavy burden on

government budgetary operations. Interest payments on

Rupee securities, at Rs.18,117 million, increased by 31 per

cent owing to the enhancement of outstanding Rupee loans

which resulted from a heavy dependence on the Rupee Loan

Programme for financing the budget deficit in 1994 and

1995. The interest cost of Rupee loans which were raised

during the second half of 1994 and first half of 1995 was

reflected in 1995, as interest payments on Rupee loans are

paid bi-annually. In spite of a growth in the outstanding

stock of Treasury bills, interest payments on account of this

instrument declined by 25 per cent to Rs.l3,947 million,

compared to an increase of 40 per cent witnessed in 1994

due to relatively lower yield rates experienced in 1994 and

the first four months of 1995. Interest payments on foreign

loans increased by 12 per cent to Rs.6,162 million in 1995.
