This forced post-Independence governments: to provide extensive welfare services such as subsidies on : essential food items (mainly rice), free education; free health services and subsidised public transport indiscriminately to all groups. However, these policies were effective in enhancing living standards. Sri Lanka has achieved a high rating on most social indicators, particularly in the fields of education and health, superior to most of her Asian neighbours, although the country's economic growth has not been impressive; Meanwhile, ever increasing costs of the indiscriminate provision of welfare services to an ever-growing population imposed a considerable strain on successive government budgets and eroded budgetary resources, thus crowding out investment and growth.",

It deviated from the concept of targeted subsidy schemes and, once again, transformed the entire population into passive recipients of a subsidy. In fact, the composition of wheat flour consumers indicates that a large share of the subsidy benefits people in high income groups. Moreover, this subsidy distorted relative prices against rice and other food crops. In addition, the sustainability of this scheme has now been threatened due to resource constraints, creating the need for immediate corrective action. The gradual removal of the subsidy began in late 1995 and is now in progress. The direct cost of this subsidy amounted to Rs.5,000 million in 1995.",

Therefore, government intervention began to focus more recently on improving the efficiency of welfare programmes through better targeting as well as encouraging the active participation of people in such programmes with the objective of improving their income generating opportunities. This was the theme of the Janasaviya programme launched in late 1989 and the Samurdhi programme introduced in 1996. These schemes were expected to link the poor to the production process by providing enhanced access to basic facilities. Their targeting was also improved through a social screening process. The Janasaviya and Samurdhi programmes have also shown that the impact of pressure groups can be minimised through such a social screening system. These programmes are consistent with the policy of assisting the 'temporary poor' by providing them with income opportunities to rise above the poverty line, the ultimate objective of the social safety net.",

Consequently, domestic non-bank financing in relation to GDP declined from 6.3 per cent in 1994 to 4.1 per cent in 1995. Thus, the budget deficit (after grants), which was 7 per cent of GDP, was financed by foreign financing - 1.9 per cent of GDP and domestic non-bank sources - 4.1 per cent of GDP, leaving a balance to be financed through the banking system. Hence, bank financing in relation to GDP increased from 0.2 per cent in 1994 to 1.1 per cent in 1995, exerting pressure on money supply.",

When the buildup of government cash balances with the Central Bank at Rs. 227 million and the reduction in the cash items in the process of collection by Rs.871 million were taken into account, net credit to the Government by the Central Bank amounted to Rs.7,662 million in 1995, contributing to an expansion of reserve money (high powered money) in the economy. In spite of increased holdings of government import bills (Rs.2,548 million), overdrafts to the Government (Rs. 379 million) and cash items in the process of collection (Rs. 856 million), net credit to the Government by commercial banks declined by Rs.597 million due to the reduction in holdings of Treasury bills and government securities in commercial bank portfolios (Rs.4,186 million) and a deposit build up (Rs. 194 million). Therefore, overall fiscal operations during 1995 resulted in an increase in net credit to the Government from the banking system by Rs.7,065 million.",
