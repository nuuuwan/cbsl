A prolonged drought, the most severe since 1987, depressed agriculture by 4.6 per cent. It also affected the largely hydro-based supply of electricity, despite efforts to acquire new thermal capacity. The problems were compounded by a few incidents of urban terrorism, which appear to have affected business confidence. Nevertheless, the industrial sector showed healthy growth. So did the financial, communications and transport sectors. It was encouraging to note that the economy showed clear signs of recovery towards the end of the year.",

This was largely due to an improvement in tea prices, as real exports grew only by 4 per cent. The current account deficit of the balance of payments declined by 1 percentage point to 3.9 per cent of GDP in 1996. However, the overall balance of payments registered a deficit of SDR 63 million, largely reflecting lower official capital inflows.

These reforms entailed a reform of the public sector, a widening of the tax base, a reduction of public debt, a streamlining of the financial sector and a liberalisation of the labour market. The overall objective was to reduce the size of government and to give full encouragement to the private sector, while protecting the welfare of the most vulnerable groups. It was felt that these reforms were essential for creating conditions conducive to sustained non-inflationary growth with progressive reduction in unemployment and reduction in poverty. Needless to say, the success of these policies would depend considerably on the progress achieved towards a settlement of the costly conflict in the North and the East.",

The real GDP increased by 3.8 per cent, as agricultural and industrial activities recovered steadily from the depressed conditions experienced in the first part of the year due to the drought and power cuts. The economy regained its growth momentum significantly towards the end of the year. The country's economic structure has undergone considerable diversification during the past two decades, benefitting from progressive economic liberalisation. However, the vulnerability of the domestic economy to natural hazards such as the recent drought remained high due to its heavy dependence on hydro power for electricity generation. The power cuts in 1996 clearly demonstrated that there is an urgent need to develop the country's basic economic infrastructure if it is to achieve the high growth rates",

The World Development Report 1996 of the World Bank has taken US dollars 725 as the cut-off per capita income level in 1994 for a country to be classified as a middle income developing country.

In 1996, with a moderate economic growth rate of 3.8 per cent, it is estimated that the economy generated about 75,000 new employment opportunities compared with an annual average of about 90,000 during the previous five years. Total employment generation was largely attributed to the expansion in activities in the private sector, as the relative size of the government sector has become -significantly smaller.

    "text": "The fiscal strategy of the Government is aimed at moving to a sustainable budget deficit reduction path within a medium-term fiscal consolidation framework to provide the basis for private sector led non-inflationary economic growth with external viability. The experience in the two previous years has been somewhat disappointing. In terms of the deviation of the realised budget deficit from the targetted deficit, there was a fiscal slippage of3.2 per cent of GDP in 1994 and 2.1 per cent in 1995. The 1996 Budget anticipated significant progress in fiscal policy reforms and a reduction in the budget deficit to 6.6 per cent of GDP (7.8 per cent before grants). The deficit was expected to be financed through non-bank sources. Some progress was made on the fiscal policy front in 1996. The realised overall fiscal deficit of 7.8 per cent of GDP (8.9 per cent before grants) was also lower than in 1995, but fell short of the 1996 budgetary expectation. This was mainly due to a sharp rise in defence expenditure, a steep increase in international wheat prices adding to the cost of the wheat flour subsidy, a shortfall in privatization proceeds and the adverse effects of the prolonged drought and the power cuts on government revenue. Total expenditure as a percentage of GDP declined to 27.9 per cent from 30.0 per cent in 1995, while total revenue decreased to 19.0 per cent from 20.4 per cent. Resource constraints on the domestic front and delays in project implementation, particularly in the areas of energy, telecommunication and water supply, reduced the inflow of foreign resources for budgetary purposes. Hence 82 per cent of the deficit was financed through domestic borrowings, including 21 per cent through bank financing. The 1997 Budget re-emphasized the need for urgent fiscal consolidation and has set a medium-term budget deficit target of 3.5 per cent of GDP (4.5 per cent of GDP before grants) for 1999. The overall deficit in 1997 is expected to be 6.1 per cent of GDP (7.3 per cent of GDP",

The Government implemented several new revenue measures to arrest this situation. The excise tax on cigarettes and hard liquor was raised and non-priority expenditures were pruned. A courageous decision was taken to raise the administered price of wheat flour considerably during 1996, which raised the price of wheat flour by 42 per cent. In order to impose stricter fiscal discipline, the Government did not raise the Rs. 125,000 million limit on the outstanding level of Treasury bills, although there was a need for additional domestic financing. With the corrective measures introduced during the year, the overall fiscal deficit was contained at 7.8 per cent of GDP, thus falling short of expectations in the^original Budget for 1996 by 1.2 per cent of GDP.",

As a ratio of GDP, bank financing increased from 1.1 per cent in 1995 to 1.6 per cent in 1996. With the net new issues of Treasury bills amounting to Rs. 11,225 million, the outstanding Treasury bill level reached its approved limit of Rs. 125,000 million by October 1996. As this limit was not revised upward, the Government resorted to borrowing from public sector institutions and statutory funds.

However, international prices of major commodities fluctuated during the year. In particular, fuel prices rose dramatically towards the end of the year, driven by strong demand, low stocks and supply shortfalls aggravated by the indefinite postponement of Iraqi crude oil exports under the United Nations Oil for Food Programme. Wheat and rice prices rose during the early part of the year and then declined, thereby recording higher average prices than in 1995, mainly driven by the supply situation. World sugar production improved, from the low levels of 1995, thereby leading to a drop in prices. Meanwhile, although global tea production had grown by around 4 per cent in 1996, international prices of tea rose significantly due to continued high demand from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which has emerged as the world's second largest consumer of tea. Demand for tea from the CIS is estimated to have grown dramatically in 1996. International prices of rubber fell from the exceptionally high levels of 1995 due to surpluses in major producing countries and slack demand. In contrast, international prices of coconut products rose dramatically, due to weather driven supply shortfalls in the Philippines, the worlds largest exporter of coconut products.",

Meanwhile, the first inter-ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) after its establishment in January 1995, was held in Singapore in December. The outcome of the meeting was considered unsatisfactory by developing countries as much time was spent on new issues raised by the developed countries, while inadequate time was allocated to items on the agenda relating to problems of implementation of agreements under the Uruguay Round (UR). In this context, there was concern that future WTO activities would be dominated by the developed nations, unless necessary action was taken to stem this unfavourable tendency at the outset.",

    "text": "The tea sector benefited from increased prices owing to the sustained high demand from the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Global tea production is estimated to have risen by around 4 per cent in 1996. Demand for tea from the CIS had grown significantly in 1996. The terms of trade improved by 2 per cent reflecting mainly the high prices for tea and coconut products. In the area of industrial exports, owing to temporary supply dislocations experienced in 1996, Sri Lanka was not able to benefit fully from the recovery of economic growth in industrial economies in the West. Additional food imports, mainly rice, were necessary to fill the gap created by the domestic supply shortfall. There were higher petroleum imports to meet the increased demand for furnace oil and diesel to generate thermal power. The outlay on imports of generators in 1996 was estimated at SDR 43 million. Investment good imports, excluding aircraft imports by Air Lanka in 1995 and the generators in 1996, grew by 10 per cent in 1996.",

Net private long-term loan capital dropped significantly from SDR 49 million to SDR 2 million due mainly to the increased repayments on account of past loans taken by Air Lanka for its reflecting programme without resorting to new borrowings and lower net inflows in the form of off-shore borrowing by Board of Investment (BOI) enterprises. Net official capital inflows were also lower in 1996.",

The Rs./US dollar rate mainly reflected the market trend, where the commercial banks preferred to absorb part of the exchange market pressure by allowing some depletion of their net foreign assets rather than trying to maintain their net foreign exchange balances by purchasing in the inter-bank market.",

Central Bank credit to the Government rose sharply, reflecting the increased credit needs of the Government. Credit to the private sector decelerated sharply in the second half of the year. The growth of Broad Money (M2) declined to 10.8 per cent on a point to point basis at the end of 1996, compared with 19.2 per cent at the end of 1995. As in the previous year, the Narrow Money supply (Ml) grew at a much lower rate of 4.0 per cent in 1996, compared with the growth of Broad Money. The increased sophistication of banking facilities, such as automated teller machines, credit cards and electronic banking, which tend to increase the liquidity of quasi-money, and greater prudence in the use of transaction balances by the public in an environment of high interest rates, were responsible for the slower growth of M1. The liquidity overhang (i.e. the growth of money in excess of the growth of nominal GNP) which arose towards the end of the previous year owing to excessive credit growth gradually dissipated during the second half of 1996.",

The difficulties in implementing monetary policy in such circumstances were reduced by improved fiscal management where measures were put in place to contain the fiscal deficit by raising the administered price of wheat flour, bread and petroleum products, together with measures to reduce non-priority expenditure. The temporary supply dislocations consequent on the drought and power cuts, tended to raise prices. In view of the continued high rate of monetary expansion in the first three quarters of the year (which was above 20 per cent in terms of broad money) and rising prices, relaxation of monetary controls was not warranted until the underlying inflationary pressure abated.",

In addition, it was one of the factors which helped to maintain interest rates on Treasury bills consistently below the levels in 1995.

Total deposits as a percentage of total resources declined from 69 per cent in 1995 to 67 per cent in 1996 reflecting a slight reduction in deposit mobilisation which was evidently a result of slower growth in income.

The underlying assumption for all these is that the market will not be able to meet these requirements efficiently, which is hard to justify. The well known concept of 'market failure' applies to cases where there are externalities such as damage to the environment due to exploitation of natural resources and careless waste disposal, and where the free rider problem, related to public goods such as street lighting etc., exists. It would not be correct to assume that a competitive market without government intervention would fail to function efficiently in the procurement, import and distribution of the goods that are presently being handled by the CWE. The presence of a state owned enterprise in import trade always introduces a greater degree of uncertainty in the trading environment, keeps away potentially more efficient private traders and undermines market efficiency. Hence, any further expansion of the CWE as a completely state owned trading organisation may not be advisable. The operations of the Paddy Marketing Board also became a burden to the People's Bank as the PMB was not able to meet its financial obligations on loans obtained for paddy purchases. It is hard to justify the continuation of the Paddy Marketing Board. This may be an opportune time to wind up its operations, as was done with the Department of Commodity Purchase.",

These include the cost of transport, characteristics of marketing channels, spoilage during transport and diversity in tastes which determine regional demand patterns. A part of these variations could be attributed to underdeveloped infrastructure. If these regional variations could be minimised through the development of the required institutional arrangements, farmers are bound to benefit through higher incomes. The marketing network for agricultural products, which was largely concentrated around the Pettah market, is decentralising to other regions and this has reduced price variations to some extent. Despite this decentralisation, about 30 per cent of agricultural output is estimated to be lost in handling and transport. Regional price variations and losses could be minimised by improving extension services to disseminate price information to farmers more quickly and by helping to improve their knowledge of efficient and cost effective methods of packaging and handling.",

More recently, the emphasis has been placed on the promotion of regional industrial parks and the Southern Area Development Project as part of the overall regional development strategy, in addition to fiscal incentives announced in the 1997 Budget for industries in remote areas. These are ambitious programmes which would require the building up of large scale infrastructural facilities and would require considerable foreign resources. The plan is to undertake these through private sector participation. Finance for these projects should come from the private sector. Government involvement in the projects should be minimal and should be within domestic resource constraints. Indirect financial commitments by the Government, such as guarantees of loans, should be avoided. The direction of trade policy is to minimise quantitative restrictions progressively by limiting them to a well defined narrow Hist, considered necessary mainly for national security, public health and phyto-sanitary reasons. Whenever a minimum trade protection is necessary for certain industries, such protection should ideally be provided through price based measures, i.e., a suitable tariff within the simplified tariff structure. Sri Lanka has been moving away from a highly protective trade policy regime to a lower protection structure. Further progress was made during the year by eliminating import licensing on potatoes, onions and chillies. The imports of wheat and meslin continue to remain under licence as this has been considered necessary to fulfill the contractual obligations between the Government and Prima Ceylon Ltd., a flour milling company.",

Interaction between these markets is minimal. Labour laws are highly complex and restrictive.

However, further progress needs to be made, particularly with a view to reducing financial intermediation costs in.Sri Lanka. In addition to the need for strengthening the supervision of the financial system, reforms are necessary to improve the commercial viability of the two state banks. The two state banks still account for nearly two thirds of the total assets of the banking system and any inefficiencies are quickly transmitted to the entire financial system. The spread between lending and deposit rates of banks is high due mainly to very high intermediation costs of state banks which enjoy oligopoly powers in the market. Monetary policy instruments, particularly the interest rate policy, become less effective when interest rates exhibit downward rigidity due to such structural weaknesses. High lending rates have an adverse effect on private investment and economic growth. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that the root causes of high intermediation costs are eliminated.",

The next option would be the re-structuring of the state banks, within state ownership, to improve their commercial viability.

Several positive measures have been taken during the past two years to achieve this goal. On the revenue side, these included enhancing the tax base, simplifying the tariff structure and reducing tariff rates, minimising duty waivers, improving tax administration and reforming public enterprises. On the expenditure side, the reforms included targetting welfare programmes, minimising wasteful expenditure and reducing transfers to corporations and revising upwards tariffs for utility services. Wheat flour prices were also raised almost up to the market clearing level. However, in the case of the latter, there is no guarantee that the subsidy element would not re-emerge in the future as the Government is still the price setter for wheat flour. Therefore, it is necessary to devise a mechanism to ensure flexible free market pricing for wheat flour and bread. This could be facilitated by permitting the entry of the private sector into the import trade for wheat grain as well as by allowing them to transact directly with the flour milling company. A flexible pricing formula for petroleum products and the encouragement of private sector participation in the import and processing of petroleum products would be important steps for further progress towards privatisation.",

Ad hoc measures to reduce the interest burden on the Budget through undue interference in the market would distort interest rates in the financial market. This has been the case with administrative borrowings for deficit financing. In 1996, administrative borrowings exceeded one per cent of GDP. Although this has temporarily depressed interest rates and reduced the cost of government borrowing, it may not be advisable to rely on this instrument for fiscal management in view of its distortionary effects on the financial market. The recent introduction of Treasury bonds was a positive move as it would facilitate establishment of a market based yield curve for medium and long-term government bonds, instead of fixed interest rupee securities.",

Interest on public debt, public sector salaries and wages and pension payment account for nearly 70 per cent of total government revenue, thus leaving only 30 per cent to meet other expenditures, including capital formation, public debt amortisation and maintenance of other essential services. These structural weaknesses in the Budget need to be corrected through a programme aimed at eliminating these weaknesses as early as possible. The programme should include strong measures to reduce public sector inefficiencies through civil service reforms and pension reforms with the aim of moving towards a contributory sustainable retirement benefit scheme, improving the Treasury cash management and improving public debt management with a clear definitive plan of action to phase down the size of the Government in the economy.",

The real GDP growth rate has been higher during the last five years (1992-96) compared to the previous five years. The inflation rate has been lower, except in 1996. Interest rates have been positive in real terms, with some decline in 1996 when there was high inflation, a part of which was due to exogenous factors. Very high fiscal deficits experienced in the 1980s have been reduced to below 10 per cent of GDP. These achievements however, are by no means sufficient. Overall performance has been lagging behind many fast performers in the East Asian region. The country's economic stabilization attempts have often met with large slippages and shortfalls in achievement compared to expectations. The country's macroeconomic indicators reveal that it has never been able to get on to a sustainable deficit reduction path. Budgetary management has become complicated by populist measures in the past and rising security expenditures. A growth rate of 7-8 per cent of GDP in the medium-term is feasible. However, this would need a carefully planned strategy with full commitment to fiscal consolidation and to expedite structural reforms in all major areas mentioned above. An early settlement of the problem in the North and East would be a plus factor in this regard.",
