The Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), which is the official price index used for monitoring inflation in the country, increased by 15.9 per cent on an annual average basis in 1996, compared with 7.7 per cent in 1995. The Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index (GCPI), which has a wider area coverage than the CCPI, increased by 14.7 per cent in 1996, compared with 3.9 per cent in 1995. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI), which measures price movements at the primary market level, increased by 20.5 per cent during the year. The higher rate of increase in the WPI compared with the consumer price indices was mainly attributed to the increases in export prices. The GNP Deflator (GNPD), which has the widest coverage of goods and services pro\u00adduced in the country, was estimated to have risen by 12.3 percent in 1996, compared with 8.3 percent in the previous year.",

It is important not only as a central market serving the city of Colombo and its suburbs, but also as a major distribution centre for both imported and locally produced commodities. The evo\u00adlution of the Pettah market could be traced back to the Asian traders who lived and engaged in commercial activities in this area. Over time, this became a con\u00adgested area with a network of streets and alleys where small shops offering a wide range of food and non\u00adfood items were located. Easy accessibility to trans\u00adport facilities, a requisite for the development of a central wholesale market, contributed in a large mea\u00adsure to the establishment of the Pettah Food Market. The close proximity of the Colombo Harbour was also a major factor in determining its development.",

The price is determined according to the demand and supply conditions prevailing in the market on that day. Each day, wholesale and retail buyers from the suburban and oulstation markets come to the Man\u00adning Market to obtain their supplies. Having a good knowledge of the price range in which they could sell each variety of vegetable, they make olfeis for pur\u00adchase. Guided hy these offers, and his knowledge of supply conditions, the wholesaler then decides Ihe price for each variety of vegetable. Once the price is decided upon, the wholesaler deducts his commis\u00adsion (which is around 10 per cent in the case of veg\u00adetables) and other charges for transportation and han\u00addling (loading and unloading), and sends the remain\u00adder to the producer through the collector by cheque or cash. As producers usually split the sale of theii produce among several traders, they receive an in\u00adstant feedback if there is any variation in the prices given. This process, therefore, helps lo minimise the price variations among traders in the market.",

    "text": "age, samba rice prices were lower in Anuradhapura than in Colombo due to the former market being in the vicinity of rice producing areas. Prices of vegetables tended to be higher in Colombo. Vegetable prices were lower in Kandy as many areas which produce both up-country and low-country vegetables are close to Kandy. The prices of onions and potatoes however were lower in Colombo than in other markets. This could be because during off\u00adseasons, these items are imported and the imports first pass through the Colombo market to reach other areas. The average price of dried chillies was lower in Anuradhapura as the cultivation of this item is concen\u00adtrated in the vicinity of that area. The prices of fish, on the other hand, tend to be higher in Kandy than in Colombo and Matara, as this town is farther away from the coastal areas. The average price of eggs was lower in Colombo due to the higher concentration of egg produc\u00adtion in the Western and North Western areas of the coun\u00adtry.",

In the case of most varieties of vegetables, prices were at peak levels in June in all centres considered.

Since liberalisation, the number of vehicles in the private sector has increased significantly. Trucks and lorries owned by private sector operators, as well as government owned conveyances, are used to transport produce from the small scale cultiva\u00adtors spread across the country to different regional sales points. Yet, perishability and quality deterioration during transport remains an important factor causing regional price disparities, particularly in the case of vegetables. It has been observed that as much as one third of veg\u00adetables are damaged during transportation. Another fac\u00adtor that contributes to high perishability of vegetables is the lack of storage facilities and inadequate financial re\u00adsources of cultivators which often force them to harvest crops prematurely. On the demand side however, Sri Lanka being a small country, consumption patterns tend to be relatively homogeneous and regional demand patterns do not vary significantly. Indirect taxes on goods and services do not have any impact on price variations as they are uni-",

Improvements in technology, coupled with development, would also result in improvements in the quality of products, better storage and packaging, which would minimise the spoilage and weight loss during trans\u00adport.
