6. PRICES AND WAGES

6.1 Prices

The general price levels increased sharply in 1996. The Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), which is the official price index used for monitoring inflation in the country, increased by 15.9 per cent on an annual average basis in 1996, compared with 7.7 per cent in 1995. The Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index (GCPI), which has a wider area coverage than the CCPI, increased by 14.7 per cent in 1996, compared with 3.9 per cent in 1995. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI), which measures price movements at the primary market level, increased by 20.5 per cent during the year. The higher rate of increase in the WPI compared with the consumer price indices was mainly attributed to the increases in export prices. The GNP Deflator (GNPD), which has the widest coverage of goods and services pro­duced in the country, was estimated to have risen by 12.3 percent in 1996, compared with 8.3 percent in the previous year.

The price increases in 1996 were owing to tempo­rary supply shortages of domestic food items, par­ticularly paddy and coconut, due to the drought, cor­rective upward adjustments of administered prices of wheat flour, fuel including kerosene, electricity and transport fares, increased import prices, increased cost of production due to higher wages in some sectors and higher energy costs. Of these, the largest impact came from the rise in food prices, which ac­counted for more than 80 per cent of the increase in the

CCPI. In addition to the effect of the drought on food prices, a 20 per cent increase in the average international price of wheat compelled the Government to raise the domestic price of wheat flour to reduce the rising cost of the wheat flour subsidy. The increase in excise du­ties on alcohol and cigarettes also had a marginal impact on prices. These, and increases in other admin­istered prices, raised consumer prices by 2.0 percentage points in 1996.

If the corrective price adjustments had not been made, the immediate increase in prices would have been much less. However, in this situation, the Government would have been compelled to resort to expansionary fi­nancing to meet the additional cost of the wheat flour sub­sidy. This would have led to a further build up of infla­tionary pressure in the economy, which would have pre­vailed over a much longer period.

Meanwhile, import duty concessions on sugar, rice and edible oil and removal of licensing on pota­toes, onions and chillies which were granted as con­sumer relief measures helped to improve the availabil­ity of these food items and cushion the inflationary impact of the drought. In addition, the sharp decelera­tion of the rate of monetary expansion during the sec­ond half of the year helped to ease the demand pres­sure on prices. Price levels, which had increased dur­ing the first three quarters of the year and peaked in September, showed a sharp decline in the last quarter. All price indicators reflected this decline. The increase in the CCPI, which was 21.5 per cent for September 1996 over September 1995, declined to 16.8 per cent by De­cember 1996. The reduction in the rate of consumer price inflation was more pronounced once the effect of the ad­ministered price changes was removed. The CCPI adjusted for these administered price changes, indicated a drop in inflation from 17.2 per cent in September 1996 to 12.2 in December 1996.

Colombo Consumers' Price Index

An upward trend in the CCPI which began in mid 1995 and continued throughout 1996 was mainly attrib­uted to higher food prices. The rise in food prices con­tributed to 83 per cent of the increase in the overall in­dex in 1996. The sub index for food rose by 19.2 per cent, compared with 6.9 per cent in 1995. The sharp rise in the prices of major cereals and cereal based prod-

ucts such as rice, wheat flour and bread, contributed largely to the increase in food prices. The prices of wheat flour and bread which had been reduced from Rs. 11.80 per kg. and Rs.5.00 per loaf, to Rs.7.45 per kg. and Rs.3.50 per loaf in August 1994, were revised upwards gradually in several stages during the second half of 1995 and again in April, July and August of 1996. Con­sequently, by end August 1996, the prices of wheat flour and bread had reached Rs. 16.95 per kg and Rs.6.95 per loaf, respectively. Thus the average price of bread rose by about 58 per cent in 1996. A decrease in paddy pro­duction by 27 per cent in 1996 and the substitution ef­fect of higher wheat flour prices pushed up the price of rice by more than 20 per cent. Overall, higher prices of major cereals and cereal products (rice, wheat flour and bread) accounted for as much as 36 per cent of the total increase in food prices and 30 per cent of the total in­crease in the overall price index.

Prices of coconuts and coconut oil rose by over 50 per cent during the year owing to a 7.0 per cent shortfall in coconut production. Notable price increases were re­corded in chillies and red onions. In contrast, prices of

potatoes declined during the year as the supply position improved due' to imports and higher domestic produc­tion. Price increases in most varieties of vegetables were moderate owing to extensive cultivation of vegetables in paddy lands due to the inadequacy of water for paddy cultivation.

Prices in the clothing and fuel and light categories registered single digit rates of increase in 1996. The sub index for clothing rose by a modest 2.2 per cent in 1996, compared with 1.0 per cent last year. In the fuel and light category, prices rose by 8.1 per cent, compared with 6.1 per cent last year. The increase in the price of kerosene from Rs.9.50 per litre to Rs. 10.40 per litre from Septem­ber 1996 and the rise in the price of firewood by about 7.0 per cent during the year were mainly responsible for the increase in prices in this category. The tariffs on elec­tricity were also revised with effect from January 1996. Prices in the fuel and light category were estimated to have accounted for 4.0 per cent of the overall rise in prices during the year while prices in the clothing cat­egory accounted for less than 1.0 per cent.

The sub index for miscellaneous items rose by 10.8 per cent in 1996, compared with 14.1 per cent increase in the previous year. Higher prices for tobacco, betel and arecanut, liquor, newspapers, laundry services and increased transport fares mainly contributed to the rise in prices in this category. Prices in the miscellaneous category accounted for about 12 per cent of the overall rise in prices in 1996.

The seasonal behaviour in prices, which is normaHy observed in the monthly movement of the CCPI, was less pronounced in 1996 than in 1995. Although the Index declined in the months of February and March in 1995 on account of the Maha harvest, this pattern was not ob­served in 1996 due to the shortfall in the harvest. The CCPI registered increases in all months except July.

The simplest is to construct a seasonal index and examine the variations

The general price level is one such macroeconomic vatiable that exhibits pionouncod sea­sonality, particularly in developing countries such as Sii Lanka which experience frequent excess supply and demand conditions due to market imperfections. This is particularly the case when some goods which carry a large weight in the food basket of the consumer arc subject to cyclical variations.

To examine the seasonality ot the geneial price level in Sri Lanka, a seasonal index was constiucled by computing the ratio ol the seasonally unadjusted Colombo Consumer Price Indc* (CCPI) to a season­ally adjusted CCPI. In the seasonality adjusted scries seasonal variation has been eliminated, while the long-run trend and short-run irregular fluctuations remain. The seasonal index computed lor the past four years is plotted in Chart 1 which exhibits a near pcricct sea­sonality over time The underlying factors behind the seasonal variations of the price index c o m e liom both demand and supply side effects.

due to higher demand for consumer goods during the two festive seasons (Sinhala/Hindu New Year and Christmas/New Year, respectively) at a time of deplet­ing food slocks.

Lconomclric analysis shows that almost the en-luciy of Ihe variation in the general price level in Sii Lanka is explained by variations in the prices of rice and vegetables which account for a si/able weight in the consumer's food basket1 . Estimation of a price equation \ia Oidinary Leas; Squares (OI.S) reveals that a one percent increase in the rate of giovvth of rice prices leads to an increase in the inflation rate by 0.22 per cent, while a one per cent inciease in the i.ite of growth of vegetable prices results in an increa.-o of 0 13 percent in Ihe inflation rale.

Both producers and consumers could benefit by minimising large seasonal volatility in commodity prices. An open economic policy winch allows free imports and iniieascd economic integration ol the domestic economy with the rest of Ihe world, improved storage and marketing infra-structure, would help to minimise the seasonal price fluctuations.

Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index

In 1996, the Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index rose by 14.7 per cent, compared with the 3.9 per cent increase in 1995. The GCPI has been consistently registering a lower rate of price increases than the CCPI. However, in 1996, the increase in the GCPI was closer to that of the CCPI than in the previous two years. This pattern of behaviour is due to the weight structures of the two indices. The GCPI has a higher weight for cere­als and lower weights for vegetables and fish than the CCPI. Within the cereal group, the GCPI has a higher weight for rice while the CCPI has a higher weight for

changes resulted in an increase in both indices but the CCPI registered a higher increase owing to its higher weights for flour and bread of which price increases were higher in 1996.

The sub index for Food in the GCPI increased by 17.9 per cent in 1996, compared with an increase of only 2.3 per cent in 1995. Prices in the categories of liquor, tobacco, betel and arecanut, clothing and foot­wear, fuel and light and miscellaneous items deceler­ated during the year. The increases registered by the relevant sub indices were 9.6 per cent, 3.7 per cent, 7.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, compared

In 1996, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) increased very sharply by 20.5 per cent, compared with an increase of 8.8 per cent in 1995. The significant improvement in the prices of the major exports, tea and coconut, which have a relatively higher weight in the WPI than the CCPI or GCPI was mainly responsible for the faster increase in the WPI than the two consumer price indices. Tea prices increased by rates ranging between 36 and 48 per cent, depending on the elevational categories, while coconut prices increased by 80 per cent. These items alone accounted for over 50 per cent of the total in­crease of the WPI in 1996.

The Pettah Wholesale Food Market

The Pellah market is the largest wholesale food market in the country. It is important not only as a central market serving the city of Colombo and its suburbs, but also as a major distribution centre for both imported and locally produced commodities. The evo­lution of the Pettah market could be traced back to the Asian traders who lived and engaged in commercial activities in this area. Over time, this became a con­gested area with a network of streets and alleys where small shops offering a wide range of food and non­food items were located. Easy accessibility to trans­port facilities, a requisite for the development of a central wholesale market, contributed in a large mea­sure to the establishment of the Pettah Food Market. The close proximity of the Colombo Harbour was also a major factor in determining its development.

In 1981, the Colombo vegetable market, which had been located behind the Colombo Kachchcri. moved into the well known "Manning Storage Com­plex" and is now the main vegetable exchange, influ­encing vegetable prices in practically every part of the country. The St. John's Fish Market is situated close to the Manning Market, as are numerous small shops dealing in other commodities such as rice, po­tatoes, onions, chillies and coconut oil. With the de­velopment of this central market, many other provid­ers of informal services such as money lenders w ho complement the banking sector in providing trade fi­nance, and handlers, who engage in loading and un­loading activities, have located themselves in the Pettah area.

The Manning Market, which is perhaps the most prominent component of the Pettah Wholesale Food Market, consists of about 1,200 stalls which are rented to traders by the Colombo Municipal Council. Of these, 800 stalls are used for the vegetable uade, while the balance arc engaged in trading in fruits and other items such as dried fish, meat, coconuts, eggs and general provisions. Around 200 lorries carrying vegetable products enter the Manning Market daily. Vegetables arc supplied from producing areas mainly through "assembly agents" or collectors, who act as the link between the small scale producers located in all parts of the country and the wholesale traders in the market. In some cases, producers themselves bring their produce directly to the niatkct. However,

this is possible mainly in the case of large scale pro­ducers who have access to transport facilities. Even in the case of small scale producers, although the trader and producer rarely meet, there exists a long standing relationship which is reflected in the manner in which trading takes place.

In the Manning Market, trading is done on a commission basis and therefore, the trader undergoes less risk than if trade were conducted on a profit ba­sis. Producers send their produce to the market through collectors with a slip indicating the quantity and ihe tiader lo whom it should be delivered. The price is determined according to the demand and supply conditions prevailing in the market on that day. Each day, wholesale and retail buyers from the suburban and oulstation markets come to the Man­ning Market to obtain their supplies. Having a good knowledge of the price range in which they could sell each variety of vegetable, they make olfeis for pur­chase. Guided hy these offers, and his knowledge of supply conditions, the wholesaler then decides Ihe price for each variety of vegetable. Once the price is decided upon, the wholesaler deducts his commis­sion (which is around 10 per cent in the case of veg­etables) and other charges for transportation and han­dling (loading and unloading), and sends the remain­der to the producer through the collector by cheque or cash. As producers usually split the sale of theii produce among several traders, they receive an in­stant feedback if there is any variation in the prices given. This process, therefore, helps lo minimise the price variations among traders in the market.

One may observe thai the vegetable market in Sri Lanka tends to be supply driven. This could be expected given the perishability and the lack of stor­age laeiliues and limited processing industries avail­able lor vegetables. During the seasons when favourable weather conditions prevail, a glut could occur in the market. Consequently, as the demand for vegetables is fairly stable, (given the lack of stor­age facilities and processing facilities), prices lend to fall to such low levels that producers may not even be able to recover their cultivation costs. In such instances, either due to discouragement or due lo lack of finances for Ihe initial outlay required for the next crop, producers may desist from cultivating the

102

P a r t I C e n t r a l B a n k o f S r i L a n k a A n n u a l R e p o r t - 1 9 9 6

next crop, thereby causing a shortfall in production and pushing up prices in the next season. Thus, the price behaviour in vegetables tends lo follow the clas­sic economic principle, "Cobweb Theorem".

Opposite the Manning vegetable market are the well known "Cross Streets" in Pettah. fso called be­cause of their official street name), which are occu­pied by other commodity dealers. Of these, mer­chants occupying the Fourth Cross Street deal mainly in rice. The Fifth Cross Street consists mainly of shops dealing in onions, potatoes, chillies and coconut oil. Most of the shop spaces in these streets arc rented from private individuals while a few are owned by the Colombo Municipality.

Supplies of rice consist of both imported and local varieties. Local supplies are received from areas such as Polonnaruwa. Anuradhapura. Ampara and Tissamahararnaya, while imported supplies arc re­ceived mainly from major private sector importers. Trad­ing in rice is also done on a commission basis and the

BOX 7 ( c o n t d . ) commission is around 3 per cent. Trading in onions and potatoes too is conducted on a commission ba­sis. However trading in dhul. sugar and coconut oil is done on a profit basis.

The new building for the St. John's Fish Market, constructed in 1983 by the Urban Development Au­thority (UDA), houses the central fish market for Colombo. This consists of 87 wholesale stalls and 105 retail stalls rented to traders by the UDA. Fish sup­plies from the Eastern, Western and Southern coastal areas are received in the market and the supply during the peak fishing seasons could be as much as 300 lo 400 lorries per day. Wholesale trading in this market is also done on a commission basis, the commission varying in a range of lOlo 15 per cent, depending on the type of fish. A special characteristic (hat can be observed in this market is the high level of organisation, particularly with respect lo the division of labour. Sepa­rate groups of workers are available for activities such as loading and unloading, culling of fish and packing into boxes elc.

The food sub index of the WPI which has a weight of 67.8 per cent increased by 30.1 per cent in 1996, compared with an increase of 5.2 per cent in 1995. In addition, the sharp increase in the price of paddy caused by the shortfall in the harvest and the enhanced demand for rice arising as a consequence of the cut back in the subsidy on wheat flour was also a major contributory fac­tor for the rise in the sub index for food. Food prices

Among other sub indices of the WPI, the prices of metal products and petroleum products accelerated, com­pared to the previous year, while all other sub indices registered lower rates of increase than in 1995. Prices of petroleum products rose by 4.6 per cent, compared to

In the end-use classification, the sub index for the Con­sumer group increased by 25.4 per cent, compared with 6.4 per cent last year. In contrast, the sub indices for the Intermediate and Investment categories registered lower increases of 10.3 per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively, compared to 15.4 per cent and 10.1 percent, respectively, in 1995.

Regional Price Variations

Prices of commodities vary across the country due to several factors. These include the cost of transport, characteristics of marketing channels, spoilage during transport and diversity in tastes which determine regional demand patterns. A part of these variations could be at­tributed to underdeveloped infrastructure. Table 6.6 shows the average retail prices for 1996 of several items in the Colombo, Kandy, Matara and Anuradhapura markets and their variations in comparison with the Colombo market. These data are based on the Countrywide Data Collection System (CWDCS) of the Statistics Department of the Cen­tral Bank. It is observed that items with a relatively low degree of perishabality, such as rice, onions, dried chillies and eggs, have lower regional price variations when com­pared with perishable items such as vegetables.

.1.5 per cent in 1995 due to the revision in the prices of petrol, kerosene and diesel at the end of September 1996. Prices of metal products rose by 11.1 per cent, com­pared with 1.2 per cent increase last year. Although, prices in the paper products, fuel and light and miscella­neous groups registered double digit increases of 10.7 per cent, 13.1 per cent and 10.0 per cent, respectively, in 1996, these increases were lower than the increases of these sub groups in 1995.

According to the sector-wise classification of the WPI, prices in the Domestic category rose by 11.7 per cent, a higher increase compared to the 6.8 per cent increase in 1995. Prices in the Import category also rose

age, samba rice prices were lower in Anuradhapura than in Colombo due to the former market being in the vicinity of rice producing areas. Prices of vegetables tended to be higher in Colombo. Vegetable prices were lower in Kandy as many areas which produce both up-country and low-country vegetables are close to Kandy. The prices of onions and potatoes however were lower in Colombo than in other markets. This could be because during off­seasons, these items are imported and the imports first pass through the Colombo market to reach other areas. The average price of dried chillies was lower in Anuradhapura as the cultivation of this item is concen­trated in the vicinity of that area. The prices of fish, on the other hand, tend to be higher in Kandy than in Colombo and Matara, as this town is farther away from the coastal areas. The average price of eggs was lower in Colombo due to the higher concentration of egg produc­tion in the Western and North Western areas of the coun­try.

Charts 6.4.1 to 6.4.4 indicate the monthly price levels in the four selected markets. They reveal that the seasonal patterns in the four selected markets do not di­verge widely. Throughout the year, the price of samba rice was significantly lower in Anuradhapura when com­pared to the other centres. In the case of most varieties of vegetables, prices were at peak levels in June in all centres considered. During the harvesting seasons, in par­ticular, the price of beans dropped to very low levels in the Kandy market due to the arrival of large stocks. This phenomenon was observed in March and during August to October.

Among developing countries, Sri Lanka is a relatively well integrated country with a net-work of roads which stretch even to the remote hinterlands. Since liberalisation, the number of vehicles in the private sector has increased significantly. Trucks and lorries owned by private sector operators, as well as government owned conveyances, are used to transport produce from the small scale cultiva­tors spread across the country to different regional sales points. Yet, perishability and quality deterioration during transport remains an important factor causing regional price disparities, particularly in the case of vegetables. It has been observed that as much as one third of veg­etables are damaged during transportation. Another fac­tor that contributes to high perishability of vegetables is the lack of storage facilities and inadequate financial re­sources of cultivators which often force them to harvest crops prematurely. On the demand side however, Sri Lanka being a small country, consumption patterns tend to be relatively homogeneous and regional demand patterns do not vary significantly. Indirect taxes on goods and services do not have any impact on price variations as they are uni-

form across the country.

Economic development may bring about a reduction in regional price disparities. For instance, as transport facilities and the road network improves, the cost of trans­port and loss due to spoilage of goods during transport would decline. Improvements in technology, coupled with development, would also result in improvements in the quality of products, better storage and packaging, which would minimise the spoilage and weight loss during trans­port. Increased competition among traders in a liberalised economic environment may also improve the efficiency in transporting and handling goods. Similarly, better com­munication facilities and dissemination of information would also help to narrow the price disparities between regions.

government sector teachers, whose wages were in­creased by 28 per cent in 1995. In the organised private sector overall wage increases were higher than in the pre­vious year, while in the unorganised private sector sub­stantial nominal wage increases were recorded for most activities. However due to the sharp increase in the rate of inflation in 1996, real wages in the organised sector and in most activities in the unorganised sector deterio­rated.

Wages for public sector employees remained un­changed in 1996 as a major revision of the wage struc­ture of the entire public sector was expected to be ef­fected in 1997, subsequent to the implementation of the recommendations of the B.C. Perera Salary Review Com­mission. In the Plantation sector, wages for workers in State plantations were revised upwards as were wages pertaining to the Wages Board for the Tea Growing and Manufacturing Trade which covers workers in private sector plantations. Three more Wages Boards revised wages applicable to trades covered by them in 1996. In

the unorganised sector, available data indicated that nomi­nal wage increases for several activities were sharper than those registered for the organised sector. Neverthe­less, with inflation more than doubling during 1996, real wages deteriorated for most activities. However, the real wage indices calculated by deflating the nominal wage rate indices by the CCPI should be used with caution as the CCPI has its own weaknesses. In addition, the consumption basket for different categories of employ­ees may be different and using one consumer price index to compute real wages would not be appropriate, though it is used in the absence of other indicators.

Public Sector

In the public sector, with effect from January 1996, interim allowance of Rs.100 became payable to those categories of public sector employees who had not re­ceived any wage increase since August 1994. This al­lowance was to be increased to Rs. 250 from July. How­ever, as almost all categories of public sector employ­ees' had received some sort of wage increase since Au­gust 1994, they were not eligible for this allowance. On average in 1996 nominal wages of all government em­ployees, as measured by the Wage Rate Index for Gov­ernment Employees, increased by only 3.2 per cent as compared to an increase of 7.7 per cent in 1995. This represents a deterioration of real wages by 10.7 per cent during the year. In the previous year, real wages had remained stable. The Nominal Wage Rate Index for non executive officers increased by a marginal 1.0 per cent in 1996 following an increase of 8.2 per cent in 1995. Real Wages for this category, which had increased by 0.5 per cent in 1995, declined by 12.7 per cent in 1996. The Nominal Wage Rate Index for Minor Employees increased by 6.1 per cent during the year following an increase of 7.2 per cent registered last year. Real wages for this category which had deteriorated by 0.4 per cent in

1995, declined by a further 8.1 per cent. Nominal wages for Government School Teachers which had increased by a sharp 27.7 per cent in 1995, remained unchanged during

1996. Consequently, real wages declined by 13.6 per cent following the substantial real wage increase of 18.6 per cent registered last year.

Private Sector

Wage rates for workers in tea plantations coming under the JEDB and SLSPC which had been fixed at a consolidated level of Rs.72.24 per day from 1993 were in­creased from May 1996 to keep in line with the minimum wages payable under Wages Boards for the Tea Growing and Manufacturing Trade where the variable Cost of Liv­

ing Allowance is paid. The wage rates applicable to this trade as determined by the Wages Board continued to be paid until August 1996 in State Plantations and thereafter fixed at a level of Rs.83.00 per day. The Wages Boards for the Tea Growing and Manufacturing Trade also fixed wages at a consolidated level of Rs.83.00 from August. As such, the payment of the Cost of Living Allowance was sus­pended for workers in private sector tea estates, as well. Three other Wages Boards covering the Match Manufac­turing, Paddy Hulling and Journalism Trades also revised minimum wages in 1996. These developments followed the revisions of minimum wages in 28 of the 34 active Wages Boards in 1995.

With the above revisions, wages for workers in the organised private sector as measured by the Minimum Wage Rate Index for Workers in All Wages Boards Trades increased on average by 8.3 percent in nominal terms in 1996, a higher increase compared to the 3.9 per cent in­crease registered in 1995. Real wages, however, dete­riorated by a further 6.6 per cent following a real wage erosion of 3.6 per cent experienced last year. Wages for workers in agriculture rose by 9.3 per cent reflecting the increase in wages of plantation workers. This, however, represents a erosion of real wages of 5.9 per cent. Wages for workers in industry and commerce rose by 4.8 percent during the year. Real wages for this category, which had improved substantially last year, deteriorated by 9.4 per cent in 1996. Nominal wages for workers in services rose by 6.7 per cent in 1996. Real wages for this category ac­cordingly declined by 7.8 per cent.

Informal Sector

Daily wages in the informal sector are collected through the Country Wide Data Collection System of the Central Bank. This scheme covers activities in paddy cultivation, small holder cultivation of tea, rubber and coconut and small scale construction activities. Data are collected from about 100 data collecting centres spread across the country except in the Northern Province.

According to provisional data on small scale con­struction, wages of carpenters and masons increased by 14 to 15 per cent while those of their unskilled helpers rose by 13 per cent. Consequently, real wages in con­struction activities deteriorated slightly. In tea cultiva­tion activities, wages for major activities increased in the range 9 to 16 per cent, while in rubber cultivation increases were in the range 7 to 14 per cent for major activities. Wages of activities in coconut cultivation rose by 8 to 10 per cent. In the paddy sector nominal wage increases for major activities were between 6 and 13 per cent.
