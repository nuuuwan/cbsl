    "text": "Monetary expansion decelerated considerably owing to the continuation of tight monetary policy, a slowing down of economic activity, greater caution exercised by banks in their credit operations, particularly during and in the aftermath of the drought and power cuts, and liquidity constraints faced by banks due to a rise in non-performing loans during the second and third quarters and a reduction in net foreign assets. Weak demand for consumer durables also contributed to slow monetary expansion. Central Bank credit to government, however, increased, reflecting the rediscounting of Treasury bills by commercial banks that faced liquidity constraints, as well as the credit needs of the Government. The sharp reduction in the growth of credit to the private sector moderated the monetary expansion in 1996. The growth of Broad Money (M2) declined to 10.8 per cent on a point to point basis at the end of 1996, compared with 19.2 per cent at the end of 1995. As in the previous year, the Narrow Money supply (Ml) grew at a much lower rate of 4.0 per cent in 1996, compared with the growth of Broad Money. The increased sophistication of banking facilities, such as automated teller machines, credit cards and electronic banking, which tend to increase the liquidity of quasi-money, and greater prudence in the use of transaction balances by the public in an environment of high interest rates, were responsible for the slower growth of Ml.

Bank credit to the private sector increased by 14.7 per cent, compared with 28.2 per cent in 1995. Increased expenditure on defence and the wheat flour subsidy, together with revenue shortfalls due to lower than expected privatisation proceeds, required the Government to resort to increased bank credit. Despite the increased financing needs, the Government did not raise the existing limit of Rs. 125,000 million on the outstanding level of Treasury bills. This, together with improved government cash management and adjustments of wheat flour and petroleum prices in. response to rising world market prices, helped to contain the fiscal deficit and bank financing. Nevertheless, net credit to the Government from the banking sector increased by Rs. 12,344 million (35.1 per cent) as against an increase of Rs.7,067 million (25.1 per cent) in 1995. Of this increase, Rs.9,873 million came from the Central Bank and Rs.2,471 million from commercial banks. Even with this level of bank financing of the defict, monetary conditions appeared too tight, particularly in a situation where the economy was recovering fast after the setback experienced in mid 1996. This called for some relaxation of monetary controls, which became effective in early 1997.",

Although accounting for these bonds has no impact on overall monetary aggregates, it causes changes in the values of private sector credit, credit to corporations, credit to co-operatives and net other assets.

This limit on Treasury bills imposed some discipline on fiscal management in that it helped to curtail less productive expenditure and contain the fiscal deficit. In addition, it was one of the factors which helped to maintain interest rates on Treasury bills consistently below the levels in 1995.

    "text": "In contrast to the very high levels and volatility experienced in the last quarter of 1995, interest rates fell rapidly owing to increased liquidity in the market in the first few months of 1996. This resulted primarily from the seasonal increase in government liquidity in the first two months and the significant surplus in the balance of payments in that period. The injection of rupee funds by the Central Bank, through purchases of foreign exchange from commercial banks, increased Provisional Advances extended to the Government and transfer of its profits to the Government added to market liquidity. Heavy overbidding at the Treasury bill auctions reflected the liquidity in the market. Consequently, the weighted average yield rates on Treasury bills on all maturities declined sharply from a range of 19.26 -18.97 per cent at end 1995 to a low of 11.98 -14.40 per cent in March 1996. The decrease was more pronounced in the shorter maturities, reflecting the seasonality observed in the recent past. This decline was reflected in the call market rates as well, which fell even more sharply, from 20.00 - 58.00 per centatend 1995to9.80-10.80 per cent at end March. The rates applicable to Central Bank transactions in the repurchase (repo) market and the secondary Treasury bill market declined in line with the trends observed in the primary market rates. The Central Bank continued to determine the overnight rate and the secondary market rates taking into account market liquidity conditions and yields in the primary market. Accordingly, the overnight repo rate dropped from 16.50 per cent at end 1995 to 9.50 per cent during the first quarter. Similarly, the discount rate for the 3-month bills declined from 19.01 per cent at end 1995 to 10.98 per cent by mid March 1996.",

With the slowing down of economic activities in mid 1996, there was a reduction in the expansion of loans and advances. The issue of government bonds to the two state banks, in October 1996, in lieu of defaulted directed credit also had a significient impact on the classification of assets. Consequently, the share of total loans and advances in total resources declined from 56 per cent in 1995 to 51.9 per cent in 1996 (without the bond issue the ratio stood at 56.8 per cent). The total value of loans and advances of commercial banks recorded a moderate increase of Rs. 15,430 million ( 8.3 per cent) in 1996 (without bond issue 18.5 per cent) compared to Rs.43,772 million (31 per cent) in 1995. This included an increase of Rs.3,416million(38.1 percent) on account of facilities provided against import bills, Rs.594 million (10.6 per cent) increase in export bill financing and Rs. 10,075 million (9.4 per cent) increase in other loans.",

Total deposits rose by 14.8 per cent (Rs.33,675 million) in 1996 mainly due to the increases in demand deposits and time and savings deposits by 14.8 per cent (Rs.6,291 million) and 14.7 per cent (Rs.27,384 million), respectively. Total deposits as a percentage of total resources declined from 69 per cent in 1995 to 67 per cent in 1996, reflecting a slight reduction in deposit mobilisation which was evidenty a result of slower growth in income. Banks relied more on the domestic interbank market than on foreign borrowings for their short-term liquidity needs, partly due to the relatively lower call market rates, compared to 1995. Domestic inter-bank borrowings increased by 83.8 per cent (Rs. 11,949 million), while foreign borrowings decreased by 28.6 per cent (Rs.797 million) during the year.",

While continuing with the policy of relying on donor funded rural credit schemes for delivering credit to specific sectors, two new micro finance schemes were inaugurated with Government funds during the year : Samurdhi Development Loan Scheme or SASANA for Samurdhi beneficiaries and Self-Employment Promotion Through Micro-Enterprises Credit Scheme or' Surathura Diriy a' for non-Samurdhi beneficiaries. The strategy adopted in both schemes was the delivery of credit as a total package covering training, marketing, compulsory savings and sub\u00adcontracting with large scale manufacturers. This strategy of credit delivery aims at the creation of an appropriate environment for prospective borrowers to succeed in their ventures.",

At the same time, several private sector institutions such as the Ceylinco Group and Pramuka Development Bank completed the initial work involved in establishing development and savings banks so as to cater to the development and financing requirements of the rural sector in the country. In the informal sector, the formation of small scale savings and loan associations that mobilise savings from and provide small loans to their membership recorded a phenomenal development during 1996. The entry of such people-based organisations into the rural credit scenario could be viewed as a salutary development for promoting area-based participatory credit activities.",

    "text": "The Government agreed to allow defaulting farmers between Yala 1986 and Maha 1993/94 to avail themselves of relief under the Farmers' Relief Package of 1994, until Yala 1997. The extension of the relief scheme in this manner is expected to bring more defaulting farmers to the institutional sector by offering them an opportunity to have their accounts regularised in a participatory loan write-off scheme. This would make them eligible to obtain fresh loans as borrowers of good standing.

However, the total new lease finance provided by the companies decreased by 13.6 per cent and stood at Rs.l,921 million at end 1996, primarily due to a reduction in the finance provided for commercial vehicles, which fell by 20 per cent. Total lease finance for commercial vehicles was Rs. 1,043 million and it was 53 per cent of total lease finance. An important feature observed in recent years has been the shift in the portfolio of leasing companies from hire purchase to lease financing.",

Even in the aftermath of the bomb attack on the Central Bank in January, money markets displayed a reassuring degree of stability, clearly indicating that the Sri Lankan money market and the institutional arrangements had developed to an extent sufficient to withstand serious shocks to the system. Most primary Treasury bill auctions were oversubscribed by the public. Operating through the money markets, the Central Bank employed open market operations as its main instrument of monetary policy. Taking into account domestic market forces, in particular, the relatively high rate of inflation, and the movement in international exchange rates, the Central Bank's middle rate for the US dollar, the intervention currency, depreciated by about 5 per cent during the year.",

The OTC Board commenced its operations from 1 July 1996. The purpose of the OTC Board is to facilitate securities trading operations of public companies not listed on the CSE. Companies participating in the OTC Board are not considered to be listed companies and they are not bound by the general listing requirements of the CSE. As the listing procedure of the CSE is tedious, time consuming and costly, many small and medium companies that have sold shares to the public to raise funds are reluctant to participate in the formal mechanism of the CSE. The OTC market gives an opportunity to these companies to facilitate secondary trading of their shares.",
