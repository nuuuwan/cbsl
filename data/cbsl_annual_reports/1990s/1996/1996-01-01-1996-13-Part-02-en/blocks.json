The Current Accounts division operated from a temporary office at the Bank of Ceylon head office building in the Fort, while the other divisions resumed operations at the Rural Banking and Staff Training College, Rajagiriya. Based on the data retrieved from the computer hard disk salvaged from the Banking Department, the monthly Balance Sheet as at 25 January 1996 was prepared and published. Since the mainframe computer which produced the General Ledger was completely destroyed, software programs using personal computers were developed in the Department to update the ledgers of the Bank, facilitating the timely preparation of the monthly Balance Sheet.",

Further, four claims were under consideration for rejection, while four claims were deferred since defaulted loans were regularised by the borrowers after submission of such claims. Three loans were repaid by the borrowers after submission of guarantee claims by the PCIs to the Central Bank. In 1996, nine claims lodged by the PCIs were fully settled, while five claims were under consideration for settlement, and eight claims were pending either for rejection or settlement.",

Special procedures were adopted by the CBSL with regard to the repayment of Treasury bills which matured during these two weeks and for the issue of duplicates in place of certificates lost in the fire. Additional interest was paid on the face value of Treasury bills that matured on 2. February and 9 February, 1996 for one week and two weeks, respectively, at the rate of 18.39 per cent per annum, the weighted average rate for Treasury bills in the week immediately preceding the suspension. Detailed guidelines approved by the Monetary Board were adopted for the issue of duplicate Treasury bills. These guidelines were formulated having regard to potential losses to the investors while safeguarding the interest of the issuer viz. the Government. The investors were issued with duplicate bills on submission of a bank guarantee or an Indemnity Bond.",

These training programmes related to the fields of agriculture, animal husbandry, post harvesting techniques and entrepreneurship development. Special attention was focussed on the 'Samurdhi' and the Anuradhapura and Matale (AMA) agriculture programmes. Samurdhi managers and animators were trained in banking, rural credit and project identification. Samurdhi beneficiaries too received training in self employment projects with the co-operation of the Agriculture Development Authority and Department of Agrarian Services. Selected youth received training in project identification, accounting, storing, packaging etc. under the AMA programme. Four other training programmes conducted by the Regional Office were attended by over 700 participants and included educational seminars for Advanced Level, students and seminars on legal aspects of projects for women, as well as for officers of banks. The Regional Office undertook the monitoring of the Participatory Rural Development Project in the district during 1996. Further, the Regional Office carried out the inspection of branches of RRDBs in the districts of Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa and Puttalam. The Regional Office also issued currency to commercial banks and accepted deposits from commercial banks. The Regional Clearing House cleared 190,563 cheques valued at Rs. 1,907 million during the year.",

For instance, during the course of the year, the Regional Office identified both the resources as well as the unemployed persons of a selected area in this region (Deraniyagala) and the fields of employment selected by the identified group of unemployed persons. Training programmes were designed to develop the resources of the region and to train the unemployed in the fields of employment chosen by them such as dairy farming, rubber based industries, driving, masonry and carpentry. An important area of training identified by the Regional Office has been the gem industry. Training programmes have been conducted in the cutting and polishing of gems and jewellery craftsmanship, which would enhance income and sales of cut and polished gems as well as jewellery, as against the sale of raw gems mined in Matale. A gem and jewellery exhibition was organised with the help of the Gem and Jewellery Authority of Sri Lanka. The Regional Office also conducted a number of training",
