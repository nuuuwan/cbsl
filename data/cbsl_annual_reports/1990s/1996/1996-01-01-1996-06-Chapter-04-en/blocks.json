    "text": "The industrial output grew by 7.3 per cent in 1996 despite the adverse impact of the prolonged power cuts from late March to the end of the third quarter. The comparable growth rate in 1995 was 10.2 per cent. The measures put in place to encourage private sector power generation by way of import duty concessions and special credit facilities through the National De\u00advelopment Bank and the Development Finance Corpo\u00adration to import generators and the indirect subsidies through the purchase of electricity generated by the private sector to the national grid at a premium helped to minimise the loss of industrial output due to power cuts. The growth of industrial output in 1996 was mainly attributed to the increase in manufacturing out\u00adput in the Export Processing Zones (EPZs) which were least affected by power cuts. The uninterrupted op\u00aderation of the state-owned petroleum refinery and a moderate growth of industrial production of private sector industries outside the EPZs also made a posi\u00adtive contribution to the overall growth of industrial output. Factory industries, which accounted for 83 per cent of the total manufacturing output , contrib\u00aduted 33 per cent of the economic growth in 1996.",

These 154 factories employed 76,821 persons, a similar amount as in the previous year.
