    "text": "Sri Lanka is one of the few Asian countries which has reached an advanced phase of demographic transi\u00adtion in a comparatively short period and at a relatively low per capita income level. Sri Lanka had a total population of less than two and a half million when the first census was conducted in 1871. After a century, the Census of 1971 revealed a total population of more than twelve and a half million, indicating an increase often million people over a century. While it took fifty years for the first dou\u00adbling of the population from the 1871 level, the second doubling had taken only about thirty five years. In the period prior to 1946, the demographic conditions in the country were characterised by both high mortality and high birth rates. The eradication of malaria after the mid 1940's had a remarkable impact on the mortality rates ex\u00adperienced in the second phase (1946-1960) of the demo\u00adgraphic transition. This period was characterised by rap\u00adidly falling mortality rates and relatively high birth rates. It was not until the 1960's that the crude birth rate started to decline continuously with an appreciable trend up to the 1990's. A distinct declining trend in population growth has become evident since 1971.",

In 1996, with a moderate economic growth rate of 3.8 per cent, the economy generated about 75,000 new employment opportunities compared with an annual average of about 90,000 during the previous five years. Total employment generation in the country in 1996 was largely attributed to the expansion in activities in the pri\u00advate sector, as the relative size of the government sector was significantly smaller. The opportunities generated were largely in the private sector and, as in previous years, the Board of Investment (BOI) contributed to the creation of job opportunities in 1996 as well.",

Although this appears to indicate a decline compared to the figure of 170,130 reported in 1995, the actual number would not have nec\u00adessarily declined in 1996 as the scheme operated by SLFEB for registration of persons leaving for foreign employ\u00adment was made voluntary in 1996, instead of the compul\u00adsory registration scheme which operated during 1995. In 1996, the SLFEB relaxed the scheme with the introduction of several incentive schemes to overseas contract work\u00aders in order to improve their welfare. Accordingly, those who register with the SLFEB were entitled to a guarantee of secured employment and insurance facilities for their period of stay overseas. Day care facilities for their chil\u00addren, a medical insurance scheme for their families, schol\u00adarships for their children and training facilities for em\u00adployees are some of the incentives provided by the SLFEB. However, despite these incentives, some of the migrants may have sought employment through personal contacts in 1996. Therefore, the actual number of overseas con\u00adtracted workers may be greater than the number reported in 1996. Indirect confirmation of this was the continuation of the growth of inward private remittances (10 per cent in SDR terms in 1996). A striking feature in overseas em-",
