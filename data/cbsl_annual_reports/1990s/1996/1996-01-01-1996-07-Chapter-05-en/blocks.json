The pivotal role of infrastructure in the economy has been duly recognised in the government policy and the need to reform the ownership and the management structure of infrastructure managing institutions has been highlighted. Considering the resource constraints faced by the government, private sector participation has become imperative in infrastructure investments. In the 1996 Budget, the government expected to raise infrastructure investments to a level of Rs. 55,533 million to achieve a target of 7.2 per cent of the GDR However, the actual performance fell short of the target, mainly due to procedural and implementational delays and resource constraints for local counterpart funds leading to underutilisation of foreign funds. The actual investment on infrastructure by the government stood at Rs.45,704 million, recording a marginal decline when compared with 1995. In relation to GDP, infrastructure investment declined from 6.5 per cent in 1995 to 5.9 per cent in 1996.",

In order to improve the regulatory mechanism relating to the telecommunication sector, the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission was established.

Non-communicable diseases such as heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, gastro intestinal tracts diseases, cancers and diseases of the respiratory system, emerged as the leading causes of deaths in recent years.

The Government's objective in the area of curative health care was to promote the harmonious co\u00adexistence of both private and public sectors to meet the rapidly increasing demand and lessen the financial burden due to free health services.

Expenditure on health in relation to GDP remained unchanged at 1.6 per cent between the two periods. However its share in government expenditure rose to 5.5 per cent in 1996. In view of the emerging challenges of the health sector, it is necessary to allocate more resources on preventive health care. In this context, in generating additional resources for curative care, the importance of alternate health care management systems has been emphasized. The prevailing high demand for private sector health facilities clearly indicates that some segments of the population are willing to pay for their health services. Hence, the introduction of user fees for certain facilities provided by the state sector, for example, expansion of the facilities of optional paying beds system may be considered in the future public health policy. A mechanism should be in place to ensure that at least a proportion of the user charges is reinvested in upgrading the related services. The promotion of health insurance as a way of financing health care is advisable in the instance of escalating costs of health services and moving into a private sector oriented health system. Currently, the proportion of the population covered by private health insurance policies in Sri Lanka is insignificant.",

Total number of medical officers available in the public health sector rose from 3,986 in 1995 to 4,391 in 1996 while the number of nurses per 100,000 persons increased from 73 in 1995 to 76 in 1996. Health facilities provided by the state sector in 1996 as well as in 1995 were frequently disrupted by the work stoppages and work to rule campaigns geared by the medical and para-medical staff, causing considerable inconvenience to the public. It is essential to take rational remedial measures to address these administrative issues as the total disruption of health services would have severe social consequences. The acute shortage of specialist doctors continued to be a major problem and the available specialists were only 62 per cent of the total requirement. In contrast, there were constraints in providing employment for non-specialist doctors in the state health sector because the available cadre reached its maximum and subsequently was increased. This stressed the need to encourage the medical officers to engage in private practice in future and to provide necessary incentives for them. To improve the delivery of health care (the under utilisation of health facilities at the rural and peripheral level and the over-crowding of tertiary and secondary level facilities) a back referral system was implemented in 1996 on a pilot basis. Under this system, long term patients are referred to the nearest primary care level institution for follow up and consultant staff from secondary/tertiary levels visit the primary level at regular intervals.",

The incidence of the six vaccine preventable diseases has further declined in 1996 due to the maintenance of a high immunisation coverage, good quality vaccine and improved surveillance. There were no cases recorded in Poliomyelitis and Diphtheria, while only a few cases were reported in respect of Neo Natal Tetanus. Whooping Cough, Measles and Flaccid Paralysis were reduced drastically in 1996. With the objective of eradicating Polio by the year 2000, a National Immunisation Day (NID) Programme was continued for the second consecutive year. The NID achieved a coverage of more than 96 per cent in 1996. The incidence of certain communicable diseases e.g. Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever, Japanese Encephalitis and Malaria expanded significantly threatening the health status of the population. During the year under review, a widespread Dengue Control Programme was launched eliminating mosquito breeding places, strengthening vector surveillance activities, educating the public and the medical staff and declaring a National Dengue Control Day. Efforts were made to contain Japanese Encephalitis through an expanded immunisation programme in disease affected districts of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Puttalam and Batticaloa. Malaria still continued to be a major health problem in Sri Lanka. In-door spraying of houses, vector control activities, use of anti-larval measures, conducting mobile clinics at decentralised level, promotion of health education and out-door space spraying were the major Malaria control measures implemented during the year. In addition, a National Mosquito Control Programme was launched during the year. Despite these measures, the incidence of Malaria increased considerably by 29 per",

    "text": "Meanwhile, with 6,194 newly recruited teachers, the total number of teachers in the government service stood at 187,451 by end 1996. Accordingly, the pupil teacher ratio was 22 in 1996. This ratio compares favourably with the standards in South Asian countries. However, a fundamental issue is that this ratio does not reflect the regional imbalances in teacher availability. For example, the number of teachers in science/mathematics exceeded the requirements in the Western and Southern provinces while in all the other provinces, there were shortages of teachers in these subjects. In addition, although the teaching strength in 1996 exceeded the cadre by 4,268, at the same time there was a deficit of 13,161 teachers in various subject areas. These developments clearly indicate the deficiencies in planning in the teacher recruitment policies. Meanwhile, when the quality of the teaching staff is considered only one fourth of the total teaching staff were graduates, while GCE (O/L) and (A/L) holders accounted for another one fourth. Accordingly, half of the teaching staff were non-graduate trained teachers and certified teachers. The present composition of the teaching strength indicates that extensive training is required to improve teacher skills, particularly in the relevant fields. Teacher recruitment should be given careful attention, as untrained and less-qualified persons brought into the system may lower the quality of education and increase the in-service training cost. To address the existing imbalances, future recruitment will",

Out of this, 548 schools have been identified and 48 of them were developed during the year under review. The Overseas Development Agency (ODA) assisted Primary Education Development Project aimed at improving the skills of primary level students by undertaking a Primary English Language Project and a Mathematics project. Under the General Education Project (World Bank/International Development Association (IDA), 3000 primary mathematics sets, 3000primary science equipment sets and 2000 radio sets were provided in 1996 for strengthening school infrastructure and promoting the quality of primary education. The Primary School Development Project assisted by Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) was geared with a view to developing selected small schools in difficult areas. The Plantation Sector Education Development Project funded by SIDA was also continued during the year under review. With the objective of strengthening teacher education, a new Teacher Education Development Project is expected to be implemented with the assistance of the World Bank and theADB.

In 1995, the total number of students admitted to the university was only 2 per cent of the relevant age group, about 17 per cent of the total eligible students and 7 per cent of the total number who sat for the A/L examination. This reflects that the access to university education in Sri Lanka for those in the relevant age group is extremely limited when compared with other South East Asian countries such as Singapore (8 per cent) and Malaysia (7 per cent). However, the need for further expansion of higher education coverage should be reviewed carefully, giving serious consideration to the need for matching formal education with the growing needs of the economy. Apart from university education, expansion of other higher educational opportunities which will improve technical and vocational skills is imperative particularly in a",

In this regard, considering the government resource constraints, the possibility of promoting private sector higher educational establishments within a proper regulatory framework should be given serious attention as an alternative. Another alternative will be the expansion and resuscitation of the existing technical education network. By end of 1996, there were 34 technical education institutions in the country with an 18,135 student population. There were 10,217 new admissions to these institutions during 1996.",

The moderate growth of handling of mail articles could best be described by the expansion of speedier alternative modes of communications such as, telephone, FDD facilities, tele\u00adfax, e-mail, private courier services etc. Similarly, the average number of letters per inhabitant which remained unchanged at 27 during the year also disclosed the slower growth in the conventional postal service.

    "text": "The energy sector experienced a major crisis in 1996. During the first three quarters of the year, hydro power generation was severely interrupted due to the failure of the North East Monsoon, erratic behavior of the South West Monsoon and dry weather conditions that prevailed during the first quarter of the year. The available thermal power was not adequate to meet the shortfall in hydro power generation. Consequently, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) imposed power cuts from 22 March 1996 which continued until the third quarter of the year. In addition to the long periods of power cuts, a three day complete blackout due to a work stoppage by the employees of the CEB brought most economic activities to a standstill. Acute power shortages experienced during the first three quarters of the year had an adverse effect on the overall economic performance, particularly on private investment, industrial production, employment, the general price level and the balance of payments. In order to reduce the severity of the power deficits, attractive incentives were offered to encourage self-generation of power by the private sector while efforts were made to expand the existing generating capacity by hiring power. These measures together with favourable weather conditions helped to improve the power supply situation during the fourth quarter of the year. Meanwhile, the total demand for petroleum products expanded sharply .due to the increased thermal power generation. Excessive reliance on imported energy sources coupled with high international prices imposed a heavy burden on the oil import bill in 1996.",

    "text": "caused by the vagaries of weather, the underlying structural factors which led to the power crisis were the lack of investment on capacity expansion during the last 7 years, over dependency on hydro power and the implementation lapses on long term planning. Hence, the fundamental issue, the dearth of investments on power generation should be addressed urgently by appropriate policy measures. In the short-run, intensive utilisation of captive generating capacity and development of alternative energy sources are emphasized. Instead of implementing costly energy options in an ad hoc manner which will ultimately lead to high tariffs, large scale power projects should be added to the national grid in accordance with a properly designed and executed generation plan based on the long and medium term needs of the economy. With respect to implementation of power projects, procedural delays should be minimised and projects should be implemented on a very strict schedule with a view to meeting impending power shortages. Minimisation of transmission and distribution losses should also be given attention. It would also be important to emphasise the need for implementing an effective energy conservation programme.",

Initially, power cuts were for a four hour period and confined to off-peak hours. Subsequently, the length of the power cuts was revised from time to time (ranging from 8 hours to 1 hour per day) on consideration of the water levels of the hydro power reservoirs, and power cuts were eliminated completely only on 19 September 1996. The estimated power deficit during the year was 300 GWh. which resulted in a Rs. 1,235 million loss of revenue to the CEB. Several other crisis management measures were also introduced to mitigate the adverse impact of the power crisis. The self-generation of power in the private sector was encouraged by offering cash rebates of Rs.2.15-2.30 per unit generated, making loan facilities available at concessional rates to import diesel generators, allowing industrial entrepreneurs to",

A sum of Rs.603 million was spent under the Rural Electrification (2) Extension Project funded by the ADB and the Rural Electrification Special Project with a view to expanding the transmission and distribution network in rural areas. Further, a sum of Rs.224 million was provided under the decentralized budget for electrification of rural areas. In 1996, approximately 40 per cent of the available funds for investment were underutilized. According to CEB sources, procedural delays and delays in awarding of contracts, evaluation of tenders, acquisition of lands, consultancy and lapsing of loan periods were some of the reasons for underutilisation. The high level of underutilisation of funds needs serious attention in view of the resource constraints experienced in the power sector.",

The price of auto diesel was raised by 80 cents per litre reducing the negative profit margin from Rs. 1.94 toRs. 1.43 perlitre. The price of kerosene, which remained unchanged since 1994, was raised by 90 cents per litre reducing the loss per litre from Rs.4.13 to Rs.2.72. Despite these price revisions, cross subsidies on diesel and kerosene continued to remain during 1996.

Resources allocated for maintenance of national roads are also not adequate in view of the escalating costs. Meanwhile, over the past years, the investment on the roads was mainly confined to rehabilitation of national roads which is only 10 per cent of the total road network. According to the Public Investment Programme 1996 -2000 (PIP), even with a decade of donor assistance only around 1,000 Kms. have been rehabilitated. As the maintenance, rehabilitation and also new construction have not kept abreast with the growing demand for transport services, there was severe traffic congestion particularly in city centres causing production losses and dampening investors' aspirations. Adequate allocation of resources for routine maintenance and a better management system to monitor the maintenance activities are essential.

Inappropriate divisions of peoplised companies led to the inefficient use of resources in those companies and deprived them of sharing the professional expertise in management and financial control in the transport business. The diversity in ownership and unwillingness of operators to adhere to the laid down rules and regulations hindered the organisation of the private passenger transport sector in such a way that would provide a quality passenger service. Similarly, the Sri Lanka Railway (SLR) also suffered from shortages in rolling stock position and decaying railway infrastructure mainly due to the lack of investment over a considerable period. These inherent deficiencies in the transport system severely threatened the commercial viability of the passenger transport sector causing heavy financial loses. The situation was further aggravated as all passenger transport providers were subject to a pricing formula",

Under this scheme, the 93 peoplised bus companies will be clustered into eleven large Regional Transport Companies (RTC) and will be registered under the Company Law. This will enable the RTCs to operate a well integrated service network in the region, to benefit from the economies of scale, and to share resources in management, training and maintenance. The private bus operators who account for nearly 60 per cent of the passenger transport market own approximately 12,000 buses, but the average number of buses on daily operations was around 9,000.

Reflecting a similar trend, passenger kilometerage increased only by 5 per cent in relation to a 24 per cent increase during 1995. Despite the increase of bus fare by approximately 15 per cent, total revenue of peoplised bus companies increased only by 11 per cent compared with a21 per cent increase in 1995. Meanwhile, current expenditure of peoplised companies rose sharply from Rs.5,300million in 1995 to Rs.6,000million in 1996 largely due to the high maintenance cost. Consequently the total operational loss of the peoplised companies increased to Rs. 783 million in 1996 from Rs. 635 million in 1995.

Co-ordination of bus services essentially promote productivity and prevent over loading, speeding and long idling of buses at terminals. NTC also continued gradual phasing out of low-roof buses. As a result, inter provincial operation of low-roof buses were completely eliminated by the end of 1996. It has also been proposed to remove jump seats (seats placed along the gangway in buses) now mostly seen in intercity semi-luxury buses for improving passengers comfort.

In order to ease this situation, turnover tax, excise tax and custom duties on spare parts were further reduced in 1996 in addition to the increase of fares by 15 per cent. With a view to arresting the declining situation, steps were taken to activate an Indian line of credit of US dollars 30 million to import buses for the private sector.",

There was no change in the stock position of the carriages and wagons belonging to the SLR during the year. The deterioration of the service was also caused by insufficient provision of track materials required for track maintenance which resulted in the imposition of speed restrictions, rail cracks and derailments. Regular breakdowns in the centralised traffic control system which is 34 years old, caused delays in the regular train services. Similarly, the obsolete and frequently failing VHF communication system also hampered the effective communication and day to day operations of the SLR. At the same time, as in the last few years, there were no train services on the Talaimannar line and on the Northern line beyond Tandikulam.",

Keeping with these objectives, the SLPA continued to implement several development projects during 1996. A new oil berth was constructed in the Port of Colombo with OECF assistance at a cost of Rs.2,215 million. The new facility enhances the efficiency of liquid cargo handling while improving the land use in the Port of Colombo premises to a great extent. Construction of the Fourth Phase of the Jaye Container Terminal (JCT) was also completed in 1996. Meanwhile, the dredging of the main entrance channel upto 15.5 meters and marking with buoys were also completed during 1996. At the same time, proposals are being studied to develop certain facilities in the Port of Colombo under BOO/BOT basis. Similarly, the Galle Port Development Project is also expected to get underway in the near future under BOT basis at an",

As the programme is nearing completion 75 per cent of the total expenditure was spent for system development activities: System \"B\" (Rs.384 million), System \"C\" (Rs.247 million), System \"H\" (Rs.l 16 million) and System \"L\" (Rs.93 million). The total extent cultivated under the Mahaweli command area during the 1996 cultivation year decreased by 13 per cent to 119,100 hectares, which may be mainly attributed to the 28 per cent decline in the extent cultivated in Yala 1996. Due to the failure of the North East Monsoon rainfall in 1995/96, water from irrigation reservoirs had to be released to cultivate paddy and OFCs for Maha 1995/96 which in other Maha seasons is primarily done under rainfed conditions, in the Mahaweli command area. Hence, there was insufficient water in these reservoirs to irrigate cultivation in Yala 1996. This situation was further aggravated by the delayed South West Monsoon rainfall. From the total extent cultivated in both seasons, the extent under paddy was 102,440 hectares, while 16,660 hectares were cultivated with other field crops (Appendix Table 32).",

To enable beneficiary participation in Irrigation System Management, 585 Farmer Organisations have been established. Some of the other activities undertaken by the Programme are, assisting and facilitating post harvest processing and marketing as well as off-farm activities , environmental programmes and human resource development. During the year, 150 training programmes were conducted.

The average annual demand for new housing units in the country in 1996 is estimated at 70,000 with a higher rate of increase in the urban sector. In addition to these new constructions, the high proportion of semi-permanent and improvised houses in the occupied housing stock, imply the importance of according high priority for upgrading of houses as well. Relocation and upgrading of shanties which are estimated at 150,000 in all urban centres is another area which requires immediate attention. The emerging needs of the housing sector strongly emphasize the need to have an effective housing finance system, increased availability of building materials at a reasonable cost, improved technical know-how etc. to facilitate private sector housing activities. In the context of the limited availability of budgetary funds, promoting private developers is essential by providing the necessary infrastructure and appropriate incentives.",

In 1996, promotion of settlement base housing programmes, such as Jana Udana, Sevana Sarana received priority as it was easy to provide basic infrastructure facilities for such settlement programmes, while with respect to other programmes, the objective was to complete the housing units which had already commenced. Jana Udana Programme which commenced and operated at a slower pace in 1995 gathered remarkable momentum in 1996 showing progress in terms of units commenced (15,599), units completed (14,061) and loan disbursements (Rs.230 million) over the previous year. The programme was able to complete 15,662 houses by end 1996 while 62 Jana Udana villages were opened during the year. A new housing programme called Sevana Sarana Housing Grant Scheme commenced in 1996, with the objective of assisting 100 families in each electorate, providing financial assistance to 15,572 housing units. Out of the total units commenced, 7,315 units were completed in 1996. A sum ofRs.78 million was granted under this scheme. Although the new housing loans provided under both RHP and UHP recorded a decline, the number of housing units completed showed considerable progress over the previous year. The value of loans and grants disbursed under UHP and RHP was Rs. 63 million in 1996. Showing a similar trend, under the Direct Construction Programme, 459 housing units in condominiums were completed in urban areas for lower and middle income families at a cost of Rs. 133 million when compared to 275 units completed at a cost of Rs. 144 million in 1995. With respect to EHP, considerable attention was paid to complete the housing units commenced in 1995. Thus, the number of units completed rose to 792 in 1996 from 48 units completed in 1995. The total number of units completed under the Coastline Housing Programme increased from 48 in 1995 to 192 in 1996. The expenditure incurred on the Coastline Housing Programme was Rs. 14 million in 1996. The new DHP was implemented to assist",

Of these projects, the Urban Development Sector Project (UDSP) absorbed Rs.392 million. The UDSP has been designed to develop 17 urban centres at a cost of US dollars 36 million with ADB assistance. Under the project, provision of water and sanitation facilities, construction of low income houses, roads, bridges and drainage systems, solid waste management, setting up of small scale industrial estates etc. will be undertaken. In addition, an Urban Sector Policy Action Plan (USPAP) covering the entire urban sector of the country was prepared in 1996. The main focus of the USPAP will be facilitating the empowerment of ULAs, strengthening the technical and financial capabilities of ULAs, facilitating investments by the private sector and addressing the environmental problems. Meanwhile, a sum of Rs.30 million was incurred by the UDA for acquisition of lands to the Land Bank. The UDA spent Rs. 14 million on administrative complexes at Battaramulla and Pelawatte and Rs.23 million on integrated projects during 1996. Industrial complexes at Ratmalana and Homagama cost Rs.3 million.",

The final draft of the CMR Structure Plan has been completed and the final report is expected to be released during the early part of 1997. The objectives of the plan are to increase economic activities, employment and the standard of urban life, maintain and increase physical access through development of a transport network, improve and defend the natural environment, development of Colombo city as a core with facilities for commerce and office accommodation and to increase housing supply. It has been proposed to achieve the above objectives through the development of five growth centres namely, Negombo, Gampaha, Biyagama, Homagama and Horana by developing a network of highways and railways and expanding infrastructure services in an environmentally sound manner.",

The demand for water facilities in terms of both quantity and quality has been further expanded in 1996, reflecting a significant increase in non-domestic consumers, particularly in the Greater Colombo area. Accordingly, the number of new connections provided by the NWSDB was 30,570 in 1996 compared with 28,680 in 1995. Of the total new connections, 16,508 or more than 50 per cent were provided to the rural sector while the rest was provided to the urban sector within Municipal Council (MC) and Urban Council (UC) areas. With the increase in the number of water supply connections, volume of pipe borne water supplied expanded by 2 per cent to 280 million cm in 1996. According to the NWSDB sources, 61 per cent of the total population had access to safe drinking water (pipe borne facilities, tube wells and protected dug wells) by end 1996. Safe water supply facilities are available for 90 per cent of the urban population while the coverage for the rural sector was only 60 per cent which was rather low when compared with countries such as Pakistan (71 per cent), India (79 per cent) and Malaysia (66 per cent).",

This will be further enhanced by the inevitable need to expand the water supply coverage in the rural sector. In this regard, investment requirements in water supply are massive and according to estimates provided by the PIP, the sector requires an annual capital investment in the order of Rs.8,000 million to ensure safe water for all by the year 2010. However, in 1996 total investment in water supply and sanitation projects was around Rs.3,068 million which was far below the expectations. Out of total investments, approximately 53 per cent were received from foreign sources, such as IDA, ADB, OECF and ODA. Having recognised the urgent need to expand investment in the water supply sector, new construction and rehabilitation of water supply schemes continued to be subsidized (85 per cent of capital cost for rural sector projects and 60 per cent of the capital cost for urban sector projects) by the Government.",

Currently, tariff policy with respect to the water sector is designed to cover operational and maintenance expenditure and interest on investment loans obtained. As in the case of the energy sector, domestic consumers were largely cross subsidized by industrial and commercial sector consumers. Tariffs on the water sector have not been revised since 1994. Accordingly, reduction of cross subsidies, implementing gradual revisions in tariff and improving revenue collection methods should be given attention. Meanwhile, the high ratio of unaccounted water or production loss (40 per cent) resulting from system leakage, unbilled consumption, illegal tapping and lack of regular maintenance is a major area of concern which, if addressed, will improve the operational as well as financial efficiency of the sector.",

    "text": "countries. Indeed, the poor arc both agents and victims of environmental damage. Many significant environmental problems such as soil erosion, coastal degradation, pollution related diseases and degradation of surface and ground water by domestic waste arc caused or exacerbated by po\\city. The long term strategy for eradication of poverty is to generate more employment opportunities, thereby increasing the income levels of the poor. Economic growth has direct and indirect impacts on alleviating poverty. Growth generates employment opportunities for the poor. Further, it is generally believed that income transfers are feasible and easier when the amount to be shared is growing. However, as said above, growth could be undermined in the long run if due attention is not paid to environmental considerations. This means that growth and the environment are complementary and mutually supportive. Hence, growth and the environment could be viewed as two sides of the same coin.",

    "text": "The agricultural sector plays an important role in the growth process in most developing countries. In Sri Lanka, the agricultural sector, including forestry and fishing, contributes about 20 per cent to the GDP. Agricultural exports account for about 20 per cent in the total export earnings. Approximately 40 per cent of the employed labour force has found jobs in this sector. Hence, agricultural development has a strong impact on economic growth and alleviating po\\erty. This is why successive governments in the past allocated more resources for the construction of dams and major and minor irrigation projects, converted forests into paddy lands, granted subsidies for agricultural inputs and enforced price controls on agricultural outputs without paying due attention to the environmental implications of these activities. Unplanned land use, liberal utilisation of chemical fertilizers and agio chemicals, soil erosion, inefficient use of water, indiscriminate forest clearance etc. create serious environmental problems. It is a fact that the food supply should be expanded to feed the projected increase in the population and upgrade living standards, but this expansion should take place in a way that does not destroy the natural environment deliberately.

In fact, environmental degradation seen in many of today's developed nations started with the Industrial Revolution thai look place in the 18th century. Incentives lor the use of clean technologies, imposition of environmental stanJaids. establishment of industrial estates, improvements of urban amenities and effluent charges have been proposed to mitigate the environmental damage due to industrial expansion. Although some could argue that these measures would perhaps hamper growth prospects, studies show that the impact is very mild and exists only in the short run.

This relationship is very strong when industrial development is given a prominent place in the growth process. Biomass, fossil energy, coal, thermal power, hydro power and nuclear power are the major sources of energy. Extraction and utilisation of these energy sources in an inefficient manner results in serious environmental problems associated with air pollution, climatic changes, acid rain and depletion of water resources etc. Adoption of energy efficient advanced technologies in the short run is the key to increasing production without increasing energy consumption. For example, the best prototype automobile would run over 25 kilometres per litre of gasoline whereas an average automobile runs only about 7 kilometres per litre.
