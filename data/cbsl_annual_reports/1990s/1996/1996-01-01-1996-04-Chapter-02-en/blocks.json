Ac\u00adcordingly, the per capita GDP rose to Rs.41,984 (or US Dollars 760) in 1996. In terms of per capita GDP, Sri Lanka has reached the threshold to becoming a middle income developing country. This calls for an early preparation for a gradual reduction in the access to extremely concessional assistance from the donor community, which implies that Sri Lanka would have to rely on other sources including international financial markets to finance its future investment.",

The performance of the processing industry of tea, rubber and coconut kernel products is determined by the output of plantation crops. The relative share of these activities in domestic output has been declining with the growth of other sec\u00adtors in the economy. The processing of other agricultural products in Sri Lanka is a dynamic industry and some areas have already developed high standards, with sig\u00adnificant volumes of exports. Some of these industries too were affected by the drought in 1996. The industrial sub sector of food, beverages and tobacco, which accounts for almost one third of the value added in factory indus\u00adtries, depends on the Agriculture sector for its raw mate\u00adrials. Therefore, expansion in the Agriculture sector facili\u00adtates the growth process in the Manufacturing sector. The Manufacturing sector needs to become more com\u00adpetitive in terms of quality and productivity as trade and tariff policies are to be further rationalised with a view to achieving a lower and uniform tariff structure.",

In contrast to a growth of 3.3 per cent in its value added in 1995, this sector experienced a setback with a decline in output by 4.6 per cent in 1996. Within the Agriculture sector, the output of the paddy sub sector registered a sharp decline of 26.7 per cent. The failure of the paddy crop in both the Maha and Yala seasons necessitated the import of 341,200 metric tons of rice in 1996, whereas in 1995 a bumper crop reduced rice imports to only 9,460 metric tons. In view of the unfavourable weather conditions that prevailed in 1996, coconut production declined by 7.6 per cent, from the 1995 output level of 2,755 million nuts.",

The economy, having un\u00addergone this structural change, has become less vulner\u00adable to the vagaries of the weather and fluctuations in primary commodity prices. Accordingly, a stable growth path has been made possible in recent years. While the economic performance in recent years has been good, the ability of the existing infrastructure to accommodate con\u00adtinued growth is somewhat strained. Adequate infrastruc\u00adture is essential to lower production costs, improve pro\u00adductivity and to provide economic development. The bottlenecks in power generation surfaced during 1996 when the generation of hydro-electricity, the major sup\u00adply source of power to the national grid was interrupted owing to the failure of monsoonal rains. The remedial measures in encouraging 'own-generation' of power en\u00adabled an easing of the supply shortage, averting a major disruption to production in the Manufacturing and Ser\u00advices sectors. However, given the trends in growth in the Manufacturing and Service sectors, the demand for power will remain high. Therefore, a clear plan of action to ex\u00adpand the infrastructure with a long-term horizon is neces\u00adsary to break this bottleneck.",
