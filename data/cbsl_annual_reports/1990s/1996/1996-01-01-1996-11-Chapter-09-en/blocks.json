The services account, which had shown a surplus since 1993, registered a deficit of Rs. 5,427 million (SDR 68 million) in 1996, mainly owing to a drop in earnings from tourism.

Non debt creating capital inflows, namely direct investment including privatisation proceeds, showed a noteworthy improvement to Rs. 6,606 million (SDR 83 million) in 1996 after a setback in the previous year.

    "text": "The tea sector benefited from increased prices owing to the sustained high demand from the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) which have emerged as the world's second largest consumers of tea after the Middle East region. While global tea production is estimated to have risen by around 4 per cent in 1996, demand from the CIS had grown significantly. Despite an increase in the import price of wheat, rice and crude oil, the terms of trade improved by 2 per cent reflecting mainly the high prices for tea, coconut products and garments. In the area of industrial exports, owing to temporary supply dislocations experienced in 1996, Sri Lanka was not able to benefit fully from the recovery of economic growth in industrial economies in the West. On the imports side, additional food imports, mainly rice, were necessary to fill the gap created by the domestic supply shortfall. In the case of many of the other food crops except rice, the domestic supply situation improved towards the end of the year. Reflecting a recovery of economic activities, intermediate and investment good imports increased during the second half of the year. Additional petroleum imports were necessary to replenish the stocks destroyed by the terrorist attack on storage facilities of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in late 1995, and to meet the increased demand for furnace oil and diesel to generate thermal power. The outlay on imports of generators in 1996 was estimated at SDR 43 million. Investment good imports, when adjusted for the value of the final aircraft imported under Air Lanka's reflecting programme in 1995, and the generators in 1996, grew by 10 per cent in 1996.",

In this regard, the emphasis on the need to curtail the fiscal deficit to around 7.3 per cent of GDP in 1997 with a less ambitious target of Rs.5,000 million from privatisation proceeds towards deficit financing has minimized the downside risk in the fiscal framework for 1997. This, together with new incentives given to the private sector in the 1997 Budget in the form of enhanced fiscal incentives to export oriented companies, including foreign currency borrowing facilities to all non BOI exporters, helped to restore private sector confidence. However, some labour unrest due to weak planning and implementation delays reduced the speed of the privatisation programme and the foreign capital inflows from this source. Meanwhile, under investment outflows, currently permitted on a case by case basis, notable investments were made abroad during the year. This included setting up two merchant banks in Nepal and Bangladesh and acquisition of resort hotels in the Maldives, thereby signifying further liberalisation of capital account transactions.",

Accordingly, commercial banks had the freedom to quote their own buying and selling rates within this wide margin. The Rs./US dollar rate mainly reflected the market trend, where the commercial banks preferred to absorb part of the exchange market pressure by allowing some depletion of their net foreign assets rather than trying to maintain their net foreign exchange balances by purchasing in the inter-bank market. The international reserve position of the Central Bank also remained comfortable and the Bank did not have to consciously intervene in the market to defend reserves. This approach on the part of commercial banks as well as the Central Bank made the exchange rate an effective nominal anchor against inflation in a high inflationary situation in 1996, where a significant share of inflation was not a result of macro-economic imbalances, but a transitory phenomenon related to temporary supply dislocation.",

Earnings from industrial exports, which contributed 73 per cent to the total, recorded a growth of 10 per cent, reflected in both prices and volumes. Meanwhile, agricultural exports, which accounted for 23 per cent of the total, grew by 21 per cent, mainly due to high prices for tea and coconut products.",

The continued high demand from the Russian Federation and Turkey, which have developed as the prime terminal markets to the CIS and neighbouring countries, and an improvement in the quality of Sri Lanka's tea, contributed to higher tea prices during 1996. The CIS countries as the major buyer accounted for 19 per cent (47 million Kg.) of total tea exports, while Turkey as the second largest buyer accounted for 13 percent (31 million Kg.). The other major buyers were Syria (9 per cent), Jordan (6 per cent), Iran (4 per cent) and Saudi Arabia (4 per cent).

Although the growth of industrial exports slowed down in 1996, a growth rate of 10 per cent was achieved during the year as a whole. Major increases were recorded in petroleum products (28 per cent) and other non-petroleum industrial exports (13 per cent). Textile and garment exports showed an 8 per cent growth in 1996 compared to the 13 per cent in 1995. The volume of textile and garment exports increased by 5 per cent. As in the past few years, the average unit price increased further partly attributable to a shift from low value added garments to high value added garments. The slow growth of the volumes of textile and garment exports was a reflection of lower volumes of exports recorded particularly in mid 1996. With the incentives provided to encourage the use of private power generators and the suspension of the power cuts in September, volumes of textile and garment exports indicated some improvement after October 1996. Textile and garment exports contributed 63 per cent of total industrial exports. Woven fabrics categories indicated the highest growth rate of 21 per cent within this sector.",

In this sub-sector, significant growth rates were recorded in earnings from rubber products and leather goods including travel goods and footwear, while earnings from wood products dropped substantially due to a significant decline in exports of wooden ornaments and other similar articles. Among the other categories, increases were recorded in respect of machinery, mechanical and electrical equipment (31 per cent), plastics (20 per cent) and jewellery (16per cent). The jewellery export sub sector benefited from the issue of precious metal on a duty free basis for manufacture of jewellery for exports with effect from 1 January 1996. In the recent past, exports of toys, games and sports goods also indicated a significant growth. In 1996, earnings from this category recorded a value of SDR 46 million as against SDR 31 million in 1995, mainly due to the steady growth of stuffed toy exports.",

In addition, the promotional activities of the Export Development Board (EDB) such as introduction of a colour grading system in gems, introducing colour sapphires to the USA market and calibrated stones to the Japanese market too contributed towards this development. As a result, processed gem export volumes rose by 20 per cent, while the value increased to SDR 59 million in 1996 from SDR 51 million in 1995.

Adverse weather in major producing countries kept wheat production well below historical levels in 1996, although improving marginally over 1995, and kept international wheat prices high, particularly during the first three quarters of 1996. Lower volumes of wheat imports (14 per cent), which reflected a drop in domestic demand due to the rise in administered flour prices in 1996, partly mitigated the adverse impact of higher wheat prices on total import outlay. Expenditure on milk and milk products increased (4 per cent) due to higher prices. Other food imports rose by 10 per cent, partly a result of sharp increases in potato and big onion imports after the removal of the licensing requirement in July 1996. The value of sugar imports declined by 11 percent, as a result of a 9 per cent drop in the volume and lower international prices.",

However, a major decrease was recorded in the imports of fertiliser (9 per cent). The substantial increase in import outlay on petroleum products was attributable to increases in both volume and prices of crude oil as well as an increase in other petroleum products. The volume of crude oil imports increased by 9 per cent to 2,033 thousand metric tons as stocks lost during the fire at the Kolonnawa installation in late 1995 had to be replenished. In addition, the oil refinery had a normal year of operation in 1996. Moreover, imports of refined products, mainly heavy diesel and furnace oil, increased by 34 per cent to 838 thousand metric tons, reflecting increased usage of petroleum products for power generation by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), and use of power generators by the private sector. The average import price of crude oil too increased to US Dollars 20.19 per barrel (c & f) following the trend in the international market, particularly from the third quarter of the year, which was driven by strong demand, following low stocks in the world market.",

This was partly a result of the imports of the 13,386 generators as against 2,006 generators imported in 1995 which was included in the machinery and equipment category (35 per cent increase). Imports of generators grew substantially during the year after the complete removal of import duty for the 7 month period from June 1996 and the concessions granted by the CEB to encourage private sector power generation. Reflecting high foreign investment in the telecommunication sector, imports of telecommunication machinery and equipment grew more than two fold, from SDR 11 million in 1995 to SDR 34 million during the year. Import of passenger transport vehicles declined by 24 per cent as investment in the transport sector remained less attractive due to regulated pricing.",

Foreign participation in the stock market was at a low ebb reflecting the continued bearish sentiments in the Colombo share market throughout the year, resulting from an uncertain security situation, power shortages and labour unrest which had an adverse impact on industrial output and corporate profits. A general shift of foreign investment away from the Asian region resulting from the rising stock prices induced by improved economic fundamentals, particularly due to advances in the technology sectors in many countries in Europe and the United States, had a dampening effect on portfolio investment.",

Of this, government debt accounted for 80 percent. Meanwhile, public corporation debt with government guarantees rose to SDR 395 million reflecting higher borrowings by Sri Lanka Telecom and the National Development Bank (NDB). Outstanding private sector borrowings with government guarantees declined during this period, from SDR 157 million to SDR 140 million due to an amortization payment by the Hotel Developers (Lanka) Ltd., owners of the Colombo Hilton Hotel. Meanwhile, outstanding private sector borrowings without government guarantee increased from SDR 249 million to SDR 252 million between the two years. With further repayment of loans received under the Structural Adjustment Facility, total debt outstanding to the IMF declined by SDR 31 million and stood at SDR 369 million at the end of the year.",

Trade in services such as those relating to communication, construction, computer services, royalties and license fees and personal, cultural and recreational services which were non-existent or insignificant in the past have become important today. FtTorts of the world community to find solutions to the international debt crisis have created new concepts such as debt Ibrgiv eness, debt reduction and treatment of penalty interest and rescheduling of arrears. Development and popularity of instruments such as bonds and notes for international capital transfers and money market instruments and financial derivatives have been significant. All these developments have to he taken into consideration and treated appropriately when compiling BOP data. Accordingly, the IMF published its revised fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5jin 1993 and the accompanying BOP Compilation Guide and Text book in 1995 and 199ft. respectively. Some of the major changes that have been introduced in the BPM5 are compared and discussed below.",

A case in point is the identical treatment, in the two systems, of residence, valuation, timing, and reinvested earnings on direct investment.

In Sri Lanka's BOI' statistics prcp.ired according to the BPM4 foi mat. labour income (salaries) was included under other sei\\ices, while investment income was covered separately. In lhe filth edition, the two main components of income (lows, compensation of employ ecs and investment income -are separately identified under income as a separate sub-account in the current account. Hence, workers' salaries and consultancy fees will be treated as labour income and show n undercompensation of employees. This would also include compensation of resident stall' of foicign embassies and international organisations which were included under government services under BPM4. Meanwhile, workers expendiluie w ill be show n under travel services. Payments lor the use ol non-financial intangible assets such as patents and copyrights shown under property income will be recoided under other services in BP.M5 lonnal.

Therefore, only a few items remain under the EDB cess at present, thereby significantly reducing the funds available to the EDB for its activities. The import cess is a distortion in the tariff structure. It is not consistent with the current government efforts to rationalise the tax structure and eliminate distortions.

In the process of the issue of insurance policies to exporters, the SLECIC advised policy holders on the creditworthiness of buyers and also assisted exporters with the necessary working capital to export to many diverse countries. In addition, the SLECIC continued its assistance to exporters of gems and jewellery participating in trade fairs and exhibitions abroad, by issuing direct guarantees under the \"Admission Temporarie Admission\" (ATA Carnet) system. Under this scheme, exporters were assisted to obtain a standard certificate which is a temporary admission permit issued by the Sri Lanka National Council of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) without any collateral security, which permitted duty free access to foreign exhibitions. In order to educate exporters, potential exporters and bank officials on export credit insurance and bank finance for exports, a series of provincial workshops were conducted by the SLECIC in collaboration with the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank and in association with the EDB.",

The average freight rates for all commodities shipped to the UK, the North Continent, the Mediterranean, France, Egypt and Syria dropped during 1996, while the freight rates to the USA and East Canada remained unchanged. The freight rates to the UK and the North Continent declined by 17 per cent each, and to the Mediterranean by 22 per cent. However, freight rates for all commodities shipped to Pakistan increased by 11 per cent during 1996. Another reason for the downward trend in freight rates was that most of the major shipping lines changed their freighting structure from a commodity based system to a Freight of All Kinds (FAK) system. Shipping lines covering Australia, Dubai, Jeddah and Jordan changed their freighting structure to the FAK system during 1996. Consequently, freight rates for most of the commodities shipped to these destinations, except for Jeddah, declined in 1996. The freight rates to Jeddah remained unchanged for all commodities except for fiber, which declined by 3 per cent. Freight rates to destinations in the Far-East such as Japan and Singapore also declined during 1996.",

As requested by the TMB, Sri Lanka also identified and submitted a second list of items to be integrated under the next phase in 1998. The Textile Quota Board (TQB), was initially established as an inter-agency ad-hoc committee with the responsibility of allocating textile quotas to achieve a better quota utilisation and hence to secure higher export earnings. However, as a response to various criticisms on the allocation of quotas in the past, the Ministry of Industrial Development appointed a review committee. On the recommendations of this committee, the TQB was constituted as a statutory body by the Textile Quota Board Act in 1996. Accordingly, the TQB consists of five ex-officio members and five others representing associations involved in the industry.",

In the face of growing competition from the private sector, the shares of big onion, potato and sugar imports by the CWE in 1996 too recorded low levels of 7 per cent, 6 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. The CWE continued to be the sole importer of wheat grain. Meanwhile, there has been a gradual reduction of the subsidy on the price of wheat flour in 1996, with the increase in the wholesale price per kilogram from Rs. 11.15 at end December 1995 to Rs. 16.15 by end December 1996. This price increase reduced the subsidy to Rs.2.55 per Kg at end 1996 from",

This could be facilitated by permitting entry of the private sector into the import trade for wheat grain as well as allowing them to transact directly with the flour milling company. In addition, the presence of a state owned enterprise in import trade always introduces a greater degree of uncertainty in the trading environment, keeps away potentially more efficient private traders and undermines market efficiency. Hence, any further expansion of the CWE may not be advisable.",

However, as the Department's activities had shrunk continuously over time due to competitive trading in the rubber market after trade liberalisation, an inadequate purchasing centre network and the volatile nature of rubber prices, a government decision was taken to terminate provision of budgetary funds to the CPD from mid 1996.",
