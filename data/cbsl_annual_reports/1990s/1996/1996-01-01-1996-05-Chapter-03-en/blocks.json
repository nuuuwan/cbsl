Tea produc\u00adtion, after a record output in 1995, rose further by 5 per cent, while tea prices increased by 44 per cent to reach record levels at the Colombo Auctions. Rubber produc\u00adtion recorded a 6 per cent increase. However, coconut production declined by 8 per cent. Paddy production declined by 27 per cent while prices increased by 31 per cent. There was a 3 per cent increase in sugar produc\u00adtion. The performance of other field crops was mixed with output of some items such as potatoes, cowpea and green gram showing higher production levels while some oth\u00aders showed production declines. There was an increase in aquaculture fish production, but due to the decline in marine fish output, total fish production declined by 4 per cent. Although the output levels of most crops recovered towards the end of the year, total agricultural output reg\u00adistered a 5 per cent decline in 1996.",

The Food Commissioner made this deficit known to the importers and monitored the import of rice. Due to high international prices, rice imports were low during the first quarter of 1996. Hence, the 35 per cent import duty on rice was waived from April 1996 and rice imports were made duty-free for a 6 month period till October 1996. This duty-free concession was subse\u00adquently extended until end December 1996. During the year, an unusually large quantity of paddy was imported. Therefore, according to MALF sources, in order to pro\u00adtect local producers as well as to prevent the introduc\u00adtion of new pests and diseases to seed paddy, the import of paddy (rice in husk) which had been liberalised in Janu\u00adary 1994, was brought under licensing on 30 August",

This policy was done away with in July 1996 with the onset of the harvesting season of the Yala 1996 crop and the importation of chillies, onions (including red onions) and potatoes was liberalised. In addition, the 20 per cent turnover tax levied on these imports was waived, although the duty remained at 35 per cent (import duty on seed potatoes was 10 per cent). This move led to an increase in the import of these commodities resulting in a sub\u00adstantial drop in the prices especially of potatoes and onions. With the objective of bringing down prices fur\u00adther and meeting seasonal demand in early December 1996, the import duty on chillies, onions and potatoes was reduced from 35 per cent to 20 per cent, till end January 1997. These measures immediately helped the consumers. Any reversal of these measures would not be advisable, as they marked positive steps towards re\u00adducing agricultural protection and exposing the agricul\u00adture sector to import competition and improving effi\u00adciency. Meanwhile, the Co-operative Wholesale Estab\u00adlishment (CWE) which had purchased dry chillies from the Yala 1996 harvest was not able to dispose of its stocks by the end of the year, as the market price had dropped considerably. It would be imprudent for the CWE to stockpile commodities at non-competitive prices, as it thwarts the commercial viability of the CWE.",

A note\u00adworthy development in crop insurance was the partici\u00adpation of one private sector insurance company. The activity of this company was however limited, mainly as a result of the two state banks not being able to accept private sector insurance policies as collateral guaran\u00adtees for cultivation loans. Under the provisions of the AIB Act No. 27 of 1973, the two state banks are con\u00adstrained to accept crop insurance cover only from the AIB.

The green leaf suppliers preferred to supply their leaf to orthodox factories at the expense of CTC factories. This is so because green leaf suppliers are paid on the basis of the net sale average realised by the factory at the Colombo Auctions. The Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) was of the view that the country has reached a temporary saturation point in CTC production and hence, they have imposed a moratorium on the incentive scheme for CTC machin\u00adery for a one year period with effect from 27 October 1996.",

Demand for Sri Lanka tea was further enhanced by the reduction in the exportable surplus of Indian tea, owing to increasing domestic demand in India. As a re\u00adsult, Sri Lanka's exports to CIS countries rose from 13,800 metric tons in 1994 to 42,200 metric tons by 1996. As in the previous year, CIS countries continued to be the ma\u00adjor destination of Sri Lanka's tea exports.

In SDR terms, this was below the prices realised during the tea boom of 1983 to 1985 and was 52 per cent below the peak SDR price realised in 1984.

The Govern\u00adment intervened and reduced the import duty on edible oils (excluding coconut oil) from 35 per cent to 5 per cent with effect from 12 June 1996 for a 3 month period, to stabilise domestic coconut oil prices. Similarly, the import duty on copra was also reduced from 35 per cent to 5 per cent. It was anticipated that the shortfall in coconut sup\u00adply for DC production would be overcome when imported copra was used for the production of coconut oil. The duty reduction was extended by a further 4 months upto 12 January 1997. Although copra was not imported in the previous year, 800 metric tons of copra were imported in 1996.",

As a result, during this period, the price of cloves has dropped drastically. With very depressed prices, clove growers have tended, to neglect their trees, thus af\u00adfecting the clove output. The manner in which to im\u00adprove the export of cloves to India would be to utilise the quota arrangement provided by the Government of India in the short term and conduct negotiations under the auspices of the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) to remove the non-tariff barriers placed by India as a long-term measure. The Government should also explore the possibility of potential exports to the Middle Eastern countries and East European countries where cloves are in demand.",

''A forward contract is an agreement to pur\u00adchase or sell a specified amount of a commodity on a fixed future dale at a predetermined price. If. at maturity of the contract, the actual price is higher than that in the forward contract, the buyer makes a profit and the seller suffers a corresponding loss. If the actual price is lower, the reverse occurs\". A for\u00adward contract is a customised contract between a buyer ami a seller. The predetermined price arrangement eliminates the risk of price changes tor boih buyer and seller. Managing commodity price risk through commodity linked financial instruments such as for\u00adward contracts will ensure a guaranteed price for the prrxluce. Such contracts will fix the revenue from the future sale of the commodity coveted and thus reduce the commercial risk ol scliinn in volatile markets.",

The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MEARD) has provisionally estimated that total fish production decreased by 4 per cent to 228,550 metric tons in 1996. The drop in production in the marine fisheries sector was due to the disruption in the normal operations of most multi-day boats as a result of the scarcity in ice produc\u00adtion which was brought about by power cuts in the sec\u00adond quarter of the year and the drop in production in the Northern and Eastern provinces as a result of the adverse security situation. The marine fishery sub-sector contrib\u00aduted about 90 per cent to total fish production which in 1995 was 92 per cent. Production in this sector showed a 5 per cent decline to 206,300 metric tons in 1996, com\u00adpared to 217,550 metric tons in 1995. Coastal fish produc\u00adtion which is confined to the continental shelf amounted to 72 per cent of marine fish production.",

Major reasons for the increase were the stocking of fingerlings in reservoirs (for inland fisheries), better management and awareness programmes. At present, the MFARD operates 3 fish breeding centres located at Dambulla, Uda Walawe and Inginiyagala. Although, state patronage for inland fisheries was withdrawn in 1989 which reduced production in this sector from 40,000 metric tons in 1990 to 12,000 metric tons in 1994, a resurgence of state assistance is now observed. The main objectives of the MFARD in developing the Aquac\u00adulture sub-sector are, to increase fresh water fish pro\u00adduction as a cheap source of protein for the rural popu\u00adlation, generate income and employment opportunities and earn foreign exchange. Prawn farming has become a lucrative enterprise in the North Western Province, with nearly 875 farms covering an area of nearly 2,430 hectares. There are 64 farms that are more than 4 hect\u00adares in extent covering 1,050 hectares and 311 farms less than 4 hectares in extent covering 810 hectares. In addition, there are about 500 small unauthorised farms which cover an extent of nearly 570 hectares.",

Although, the fishing in\u00addustry is highly capital intensive, the inflow of capital is not at a desired level. Only about 47 per cent of the fish\u00ading craft are motorised. To overcome many of these con\u00adstraints, the MFARD provides various producer assis\u00adtance schemes which showed a substantial increase in \u2022 1996. Total assistance disbursed to the fisheries sector amounted to Rs.83 million in 1996 which was a 39 percent increase when compared with Rs.60 million disbursed in 1995. The marine fishery sector received Rs.80 million while the aquaculture fishery sector received Rs.3 mil\u00adlion. Under the producer assistance schemes, 202 mechanised day boats, 53 multi-day boats, 503 traditional crafts, 54 motors, 340 fishing gear units, 28 items of other equipment such as SSB Radios and Navigators were issued to the marine fishery sector. In 1995, 196 mechanised day boats, 40 multi-day boats and 333 tradi\u00adtional crafts were issued. However, fishing gear units issued in 1996 dropped by 66 units when compared to 1995. Prawn farms which suffered a loss due to the white spots disease in 1996, were granted relief by way of a 15 month grace period to repay bank loans. Fisheries Co\u00adoperative Societies (FCSS) usually operate as credit in\u00adstitutions and a means of providing state assistance to fishing communities. As only about 30 per cent of these societies were active during 1996, State assistance was routed through the district offices of the MFARD. How\u00adever, action was taken during the year to re-organise the 629 registered FCSS, to function efficiently.",

Reduc\u00adtion in the application of fertiliser to the paddy sector during both Maha and Yala seasons could be attributed to the drastic reduction in the extents sown during both the seasons on account of the drought conditions that prevailed during the year.
