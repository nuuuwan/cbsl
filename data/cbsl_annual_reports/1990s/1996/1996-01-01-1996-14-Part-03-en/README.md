" This Letter of Credit is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1204 SRI (SF) and becomes effective only if and when Asian Development Bank issues its commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank. For payment, please follow the instructions contained in the said commitment letter."

Even if the above mentioned clause is not incorporated in the Letter of Credit, it is immediately operative on the strength of your commitment to finance the transaction. However, the ADB's commitment if and when issued, will shift the financing commitment to the ADB. In this case, the Letter of Credit should contain the following clause:

" The financing of this Letter of Credit is undertaken by Bank of Ceylon, Colombo, Sri Lanka. However, it is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1204 SRI (SF), and if and when Asian Development Bank issues the commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank, the latter shall follow the instructions contained in the said commitment letter, and claim payment/reimbursement from Asian Development Bank."

Two copies of your Letter of Credit should be sent to UDA who will arrange to have the ADB issue its formal letter of commitment to your correspondent. If the ADB agrees to the UDA's request it will issue a formal commitment letter to the designated commercial bank in the form shown in the Annex 1 to this letter.

3. (i) ADB's written approval is required for any amendments to the Letter of Credit involving:

(a) terms of payment including currency and amount of the Letter of Credit;

(b) the description or quantity of goods;

(c) the beneficiary;

(d) the country of origin; and

(e) extension of the expiry date of the Letter of Credit beyond the closing date i.e. 30th June 1998 for withdrawal from the Loan Account.

iii

Amendments not covered under (a) to (e) above do not require ADB's approval. Requests for approval of amendments mentioned above should be made promptly by UDA on the form shown in Annex 2 to this letter accompanied by one copy of the amendment signed by you. The amend-meniSTaLEmoTCfeffirThSQCh cases sTkmrniiCmaeThefoTToWing provlslOnl

" This amendment shall become effective when it is approved by ADB."

The ADB's approval, if given, will be communicated to your correspondent as well as the UDA on the form shown in Annex 3 to this letter.

(ii) The expiry date and the shipping date may be extended upto the closing date for withdrawal from the Loan Account without ADB's prior approval. When such extension has been made, UDA should promptly inform ADB of such extension in the form shown in Annex 2 to this letter attaching one copy of the extension duly signed by you. Two copies of every amendment, whether subject to ADB's prior approval or not, should be sent by you to UDA who will arrange, where necessary, for the ADB's approval to be issued.

4. On making payment to the beneficiary in terms of a Letter of Credit in respect of which, a letter of commitment has been issued by the ADB, your correspondent should forward the relevant documents to you and request reimbursement from ADB in the form shown in Annex 4 to this letter.

In case there is any discrepancy/ies between the shipping documents and the terms of a Letter of Credit, the ADB will not be in a position to honour the payment claim, nor will it be in a position to accept a Letter of Indemnity issued or endorsed by (Negotiating) commercial bank. In such an event, the negotiating com­mercial bank should seek through yourselves the UDA authorization to pay despite such discrepancy.

The UDA after authorising the payment in consultation with yourselves, should inform ADB by cable of the discrepancy and of the payment authorization given to the negotiating bank.

6. Where a commitment is issued by ADB in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, the commitment letter will specify the U.S. Dollar equivalent determined on the basis of the exchange rate at which the ADB expect the non-tT.S. currency to become available for payment under such commitment. If, in the case of any particular claim made by any of your correspondents in a non-U.S. Currency, the U.S. Dollar equivalent exceeds the amount available under ADB's commitment, ADB will limit the reimbursement to the non-U.S; currency equivalent of such U.S. Dollar amount available. If for this reason or for any other reason whatso­ever, ADB declines to reimburse your correspondent in full or in part in respect of a claim made in terms of your Letter of Credit, you may remit to your correspondent the amount disallowed by the ADB. You should make necessary arrangements for this purpose with UDA.

7. The Controller of Exchange will advise you regarding Exchange Control requirements in this connec­tion.

8. All your charges should be for account of UDA.

In order to facilitate prompt disbursement, your correspondent may send an authenticated SWIFT, telex or cable request to the ADB in the form shown in Annexure 5 to this letter. You should arrange for y*our correspondent to advise you as expeditiously as possible whether the ADB has made reimbursement to your correspondent and you should retain in your possession the shipping documents received from your correspondent until you are satisfied that your correspondent has been reimbursed by ADB. No counterpart funds are to be collected from the Executing Agency at the time of releasing the documents.

5. In case there is any discrepancy/ies between the shipping documents and the terms of a Letter of Credit, the ADB will not be in a position to honour the payment claim. Neither will it be in a position to accept a Letter of Indemnity issued nor endorsed by (Negotiating) commercial bank. In such an event, the negotiating commercial bank should seek through yourselves the Executing Agency's authorization to pay despite such discrepancy.

The Executing Agency after authorizing the payment in consultation with yourselves, should inform ADB by cable of the discrepancy and of the payment authorization given to the negotiating bank.

6. Where a commitment is issued by ADB in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, the commitment letter will specify the U.S. Dollar equivalent determined on the basis of the exchange rate at which the ADB expect the non-U.S. currency to become available for payment under such commitment. If, in the case of any particular claim made by any of your correspondents in a non-U.S. Currency, the U.S. Dollar equivalent exceeds the amount available under ADB's commitment, ADB will limit the reimbursement to the non-U.S. currency equivalent of such U.S. Dollar amount available. If for this reason or for any other reason whatso-

xv

ever, ADB declines to reimburse your correspondent in full or in part in respect of a claim made in terms of your Letter of Credit, you may remit to your correspondent the amount disallowed by the ADB. You should make necessary arrangements for this purpose with the Executing Agency.

7. The Controller of Exchange will advise you regarding Exchange Control requirements in this connec­tion.

8. All your charges should be for account of the Executing Agency.

Yours faithfully,
