    "text": "Increased demand for energy following the improved business climate and the en\u00adhancement of hydro electricity generation resulting from favourable weather conditions and increased installed capacity were the significant features of the developments in the domestic energy sector during 1990. Exorbitant increases in the prices of petroleum products in the international market following the eruption of the Gulf crisis in August, 1990 caused adverse implications on the energy sector during the year. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Railways and Private bus transporters showed improved performance, while the operations of the Sri Lanka Transport Board continued to deteriorate. Reflecting the high priority assigned to the housing sector by the government, the One Point Five Million Houses Programme was launched in 1990. However, the activities in this sector were affected to some extent by material and financial constraints. Meanwhile, the Postal and Telecommunication sectors witnessed progress in 1990 with the improvement of the security situation in the country.",

Increased installed capacity of hydro power, coupled with favourable weather conditions that prevailed during most parts of the year resulted in an increased level of hydro electricity generation. Consequently, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was able to meet almost all the country's entire electricity demand from hydro power and reduce thermal power generation to a negligible level. However, during the latter half of the year, the energy sector had to face certain adverse developments, largely due to sharp increases in the prices of petroleum products in the international market following unstable conditions in the Gulf Region and consequent price adjustments in the domestic market",

Consequently, the total electricity generation in 1990 was almost confined to hydro sources thereby raising its share in commercial energy to 29 per cent from 26 per cent in 1989. Correspondingly, thermal power genera\u00adtion recorded a substantial decline from 56 million kWh to 4.88 million kWh in 1990. The sharp decline in the dependence on petroleum products for electricity generation not only reduced the unit cost of power generation but also provided relief to the balance of payments. Meanwhile, the generation and transmission losses increased to 589 million kWh in 1990 Or 18.7 per cent of total generation as compared with 511 million kWh or 17.9 per cent in 1989. The increase in. losses was largely due to the under recording of electricity sales to the Northern and Eastern regions affected by civil disturbances.",

However, the services provided by the Sri Lanka Railway (SLR) improved considerably during the year with the restoration of train services to the Northern and Eastern provinces, although the operations were slowed to some extent during the latter half of the year owing to the resumption of civil disturbances in those regions. The private sector, on the other hand, was able to expand its operations largely due to increased availability of credit facilities and tax concessions offered by the govern\u00adment Meanwhile, fares of all modes of transport had increased during the year, due to the sharp upward adjustments of fuel prices in the domestic market",

The total allocation committed was Rs. 68 million and Rs. 49 million received in 1990. Meanwhile, Housing Development Co-operative Societies (HDCS) were established to smoothen the operation of the OPFMHP at community level. It was proposed to expand the HDCSs network throughout the community by establishing them in each Pradeshiya Sabah Division. Further, Resources Development Projects were launched with twin ob\u00adjectives of producing low cost building materials and generating income opportunities with optimal utilization of local resources.

However, the number of loans and amount sanc\u00adtioned under the housing loan scheme of the SMIB declined by 9 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively over the previous year.

Asa preliminary requirement, Janasaviya Entitle\u00adment Certificates were distributed among all the 2.3 million food stamp receiving families on 29th June, 1989, throughout the island without considering the eligibility criteria.

The identification of families for Janasaviya benefits is done by the respective communities through a family identification process in an open procedure without bureaucratic interventions.
