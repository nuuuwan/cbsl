Favourable weather conditions and easing of civil disturbances in most parts of the country were among the factors contributing to this impressive performance. During 1990, tea production increased substantially by 13 per cent and reached the highest level ever recorded. Rubber and coconut production increased marginally by 3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively while paddy production recorded a very sharp increase of 23 per cent in 1990. Sugar production recorded a 6 per cent growth. The improved performance of the minor food crops and minor export crops sectors have also contributed to the recovery of the agriculture sector.",

    "text": "Tea production which had been fluctuating around an average of205 million kgs. during the last 10 years recovered significantly in 1990 to reach 233 million kgs., the highest level ever recorded. This remarkable increase was primarily attributed to favourable weather conditions and the easing of civil disturbances. Full production recovery of the plantations in low grown areas and the adoption of better cultural practices in response to relatively higher prices would also have contributed to this expansion in production. The recovery in production was evident in all three elevational categories but was more pronounced in Low grown areas where the increase was as high as 27 per cent. Low grown tea production in 1990at 105 million kgs. was the highest ever on record. High and Medium grown tea production recorded increases of 3 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. The production of 'orthodox' tea (including LTP teas) rose by 12 per cent to 228 million kgs. The CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea production increased by 35 per cent to 5.7 million kgs. in 1990, accounting for about 2 per cent of the total tea production. : . . ' ; \u2022 '",

    "text": "Sugar production which rose marginally to 53,839 metric tons in 1989, recorded a further increase of 6 per cent to 57,171 metric tons in 1990. Improved security conditions, adequate rainfall and the expansion in planting activities of the outgrowers were the main contributory factors to the higher level of production in 1990. The Kantale, Sevanagala and Pelwatte factories contributed to this improvement in production, though unevenly. The Kantale factory which reported a 62 per cent increase in production in 1989 reported a further increase of 3 per cent to 2,364 metric tons in 1990. The Sevanagala factory which showed a 19 per cent decrease in production during 1989, recorded an 8 percent increase, from 8,928 metric tons in 1989 to 9,648 metric tons in 1990. Despite the reduced availability of cane for crushing at both Kantale and Sevanagala factories, the production increased mainly in response to the improved sugar recovery rates in 1990. The Pelwatte factory which recorded a 5 percent drop in production during 1989, reported a 16 per cent increase to 33,020 metric tons. The growth in production was attributable to the increased availability of sugar cane for crushing which in turn was largely due to the larger quantity of cane purchased. The Pelwatte factory which accounted for 53 per cent of the total sugar production in 1989 consolidated its position further in 1990 by increasing its share to 58 per cent. After three consecutive years of increases, production of the Hingurana factory declined by 15 per cent to 12,139 metric tons in 1990. Reduced availability of cane for processing resulting mainly from the abandonment of lands by certain allottees and damages to the crop caused by fire as well as wild animals appeared to have contributed to the poor production performance at this factory.",

Production of soyabeans and gingelly more than doubled during 1990, while the output of blackgram and maize showed substantial increases of 69 per cent and 58 per cent, respec\u00adtively. This significant expansion in production was mainly attributed to increased extents under those crops as well as higher average yields, resulting from favourable weather conditions and the improved security situation in the producing areas. Substantial increases recorded in the production of greengram and cowpea in 1990 were mainly due to increases in the extents cultivated.",

In June, 1990 the MILCO Ltd. increased its raw milk purchasing price by approximately 80 cents per litre in view of the increased cost of production.",
