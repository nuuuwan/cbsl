Further, as a measure to strengthen its supervisory role, the Department also monitored the compliance by commercial banks with the credit ceilings imposed in June, 1989 on bank credit to non-priority sectors and on cash margin requirements on Letters of Credit

for specified imports considered non-essential. The Department also monitored the commercial banks' adherence to the working balance limits imposed on them by recourse to the Daily Returns of Positions of foreign currencies. Recognising the importance of having a uniform system of publishing financial statements, the Department initiated action to implement Part V of the Banking Act by means of a notification published in the Government Gazette No:628/10 dated 18th September, 1990. Consequent upon the implementation of part V of the Banking Act, the Department introduced "Accounts Formats for Banks" thereby establishing minimum standards on disclosure in the presentation of Annual Financial Statements by commercial banks. The Department also initiated action to introduce a set of guidelines for compliance by commercial banks in respect of suspension of interest on non-performing advances, and provisioning against bad and doubtful advances.

The Department continued to monitor the transactions of Foreign Currency Banking Units established by commercial banks under the "Foreign Currency Banking Scheme" on the basis of monthly returns furnished by them. The profitability of both domestic banks and Foreign Currency Banking Units was analysed on the basis of returns furnished to the Department.

During 1990, the Department continued to administer the Deposit Insurance Scheme which came into operation with the promulgation in April, 1987 of the. Regulations under Section 32E of the Monetary Law Act This Scheme extends its coverage to commercial banks, Regional Rural Development Banks and co-operative rural banks of the Multi­purpose Co-operative Societies on an optional basis.

During 1990, 16 Multi-Purpose Co-operative Societies with a network of 116 co­operative rural banks were examined by the Department prior to their applications being considered for registration under this Scheme.

As at end of December, 1990, two commercial banks, three Regional Rural Development Banks and eight Multi-Purpose Co-operative Societies with a total of sixty five co-operative rural banks had been registered as insured societies and insured banks.

SUPERVISION OF FINANCE COMPANIES

The total deposits with finance companies increased from Rs.6,527 million as at the end of 1989 to Rs.6,707 million as at end of 1990. This increase needs to be viewed in the context of the restructuring that was in progress in the finance companies sub-sector of the financial sector which contributed to reducing the number of active finance companies from about 60 as at end of 1989 to about 40 at the end of 1990. By the end of 1990 the Monetary Board of the Central Bank had granted registration and licence to 20 finance companies to conduct finance business. The total deposits of these registered companies amounted to Rs.5,423 million as at,the end of 1990. While the overall increase in deposits with finance companies in 1990 was 2.7 per cent, the increase in the deposits of the 20 companies registered was 12.2 per cent

The Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions continued to monitor and supervise the finance companies registered with the Central Bank by conducting regular on-site examinations and surveillance of such companies on the basis of statistical data furnished by them. In order to further strengthen the supervisory and regulatory functions of the Central Bank over finance companies, amendments to the

XI

Finance Companies Act No.78 of 1988 were promulgated as Emergency Regulations under Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance (Chapter 40). Comprehensive on-site examinations were conducted in respect of finance companies as in the previous year. As a preliminary to the registration of finance companies, the business activities of the companies which were eligible for registration were examined in depth. The off-site surveillance through the Early Warning System (EWS) which was introduced in February 1^89 continued during 1990.

One finance company which gave clear indications of mismanagement was subject to an investigative audit through a firm of independent auditors appointed by the Central Bank under Section 12 (d) of the Finance Companies Act No.78 of 1988. Subsequently, the business of the Company was suspended in terms of Section 18 (1) of the same Act and on the expiry of the suspension period the Company was directed to divest finance business and submit a programme to settle deposit liabilities.

Registration of Companies

In terms of Section 2 of the Finance Companies Act No.78 of 1988, only public companies registered under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 with a minimum issued and paid up capital of not less than Rs.5 million and registered by the Central Bank are permitted to carry on finance business. However, the institutions that were carrying on finance business on the day preceding the enactment of the Finance Companies Act were permitted to carry on finance business for a transitional period of 2 years notwithstanding the fact that they were not registered in terms of the Act Through the notices published in the Press the public was informed that it is illegal to conduct finance business by unregistered financial institutions after the expiry of the transitional period on 18th December, 1990.

During the second half of 1990, the Central Bank initiated action to register finance companies under the provisions of the 1988 Finance Companies Act. Subsequent to the announcement of rules and prescribed forms of application relating to registration and licensing of finance companies under the Act in June, 1990, 30 finance companies applied for registration in 1990. By the end of 1990, 20 of these companies which satisfied the requirements for registration were granted licences to carry on finance business for a period of 12 months.

The financial institutions which had not registered by 18th December, 1990 were directed to divest their finance businesses and to commence settling their liabilities to depositors within 30 days of the issue of Direction No.2 of 1990 given by the Monetary Board on 17th December, 1990. In terms of Direction No.2, the financial institutions not registered were required to pay their deposit liabilities in the following manner -

i. Those financial institutions which had deposit liabilities exceeding Rs.40.0 million as at 19th December, 1990 shall pay up their deposits by not less than 5 per cent per month; and

ii. Those financial institutions which had deposits not exceeding Rs.40.0 million shall pay up by not less than 8.5 per cent per month.

During the year 1990, investigation reports on five finance companies, the administration and management of which have been vested in the Monetary Board, were

The outstanding value of investments of the SMI guarantee fund in Treasury bills was Rs. 189.8 million at the end of 1990 while the total interest income received during the year amounted to Rs.28 million.

Follow-up and Inspection of Projects

The follow-up and inspection of projects financed under the SMI loan schemes were intensified during the year with a view to taking corrective action where necessary and to settling claims lodged by PCIs. During 1990,168 projects located in^Colombo, Gampaha, Puttalam, Rathapura, Badulla and Kurunegala districts were inspected.

Bus Purchase Loan Credit Guarantee Scheme

The Monetary Board, approved on 22nd November, 1990 a credit guarantee scheme for loans granted by PCIs to private bus operators for the purchase of buses. These loans were refinanced by the National Development Bank (NDB) upto 75 per cent of the value of the bus from the proceeds of the Economic Restructuring Credit line of the World Bank granted to the Government of Sri Lanka. The terms and conditions of the guarantee scheme were similar to those for the SMI scheme, excepting the following:

(a) The premium for the guarantee is payable annually at the beginning of each year at the rate of 1 per cent of the amount guaranteed and outstanding in the loan account at the end of each immediately preceding year.

(b) Currency of the guarantee cover is conditional to the PCIs submitting within 90 days from the date of disbursement of the loan a certificate confirming the execution of the mortgage bond and the Certificate of Registration of the vehicle with an entry that the mortgage bond is duly registered. The PCIs are also required to submit an undertaking that they will retain the Certificate of Registration until the loan is fully repaid.

(c) Unlike in the case of SMI Schemes, the Central Bank will pay the PCIs on submission of a claim application a sum not exceeding 50 per cent of the Central Bank's liability under the guarantee on condition that the PCIs repay such payments in the event they fail to take recovery action as specified by the Central Bank.

(d) The Central Bank's liability on a guarantee will lapse if the ownership of the bus is transferred without the approval of both the PCI and the Central Bank.

These additional conditions were imposed as a safeguard against the high risk exposure to be borne by the Central Bank under the Credit Guarantee Scheme. A transfer of Rs.22 million from the General Reserve of the Central Bank was approved by the Monetary Board to meet the Central Bank's liability under the scheme-Entrepreneur Development Programme

The Entrepreneur Development Programme which had been suspended during 1989 owing to unsettled conditions in the country recommenced in 1990. Accordingly, three programmes were conducted during the year. Two programmes aimed at creating awareness in self-employment opportunities among school leavers and Janasaviya recipients were held in the districts of Nuwara Eliya and Matale. The first programme in Nuwara Eliya district held in July 1990 was attended by 100 participants while the

XX

second programme held in Galewela in October 1990 was attended by 125 participants. The third programme devoted to Management and Technological Upgrading of existing garment manufacturing industries was held in the Kandy district in December 1990 and was attended by 30 garment manufacturing industrialists. All these programmes were conducted with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Industrial Development Board.

RURAL CREDIT

In 1990, the Bank continued its role as a credit executing agency for the implementation of the following credit schemes funded by foreign agencies.

1. Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project - Phase II

2. International Fund for. Agricultural Development (IFAD) funded Badulla District Integrated Rural Development Project

3 IFAD funded Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development Project

4. IDA funded Matale-Puttalam Districts Integrated Rural Development Project

5. ADB funded Perennial Crop Development Project

6. ADB funded Small Holder Tea Development Project

7. ADB funded Agriculture Rehabilitation Project

The operation of the Badulla Integrated Rural Development Project was extended for the third time for a further period of two years upto 31st July, 1992 in order to use the project funds which remained unutilised out of the original allocation made for implementation of the project during the project period 1983 - 1987.

The operation of the Matale-Puttalam Districts Integrated Rural Development Project Credit Scheme was terminated on 30th June 1990 at the end of a nine year project period which commenced on 29th June, 1981.

The Bank continued to inspect the agricultural loan portfolio of selected branches of commercial banks and the general working of Co-operative Rural Banks in order to obtain an assessment of the operations in the sphere of rural credit and to assist these institutions in formulating appropriate policies and procedures.

During 1990, the Central Bank approved nineteen acceptance credit limits amounting to Rs.26 million under the Central Bank's Inland Bill Scheme. Of the approved limits, three Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs) utilized this facility and issued Inland Bills amounting to Rs.6 million to finance the processing of 693,538 kgs. of green leaf.

The Bank together with the three member institutions of the Asian Pacific Regional Agricultural Credit Association (APRACA) in Sri Lanka hosted the 23rd APRACA Executive Committee Meeting held in August, 1990.

REGIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS (RRDBs)

The Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) established under the Regional Rural Development Banks Act, No.15 of 1985;. with a view to developing the rural economy by providing financial assistance for the development of agriculture, cottage

XXI

and small scale industry, fishing industry, commerce and other development activities in the rural areas, further expanded their activities in 1990.

Expansion of the RRDB Network

The twelfth Regional Rural Development Bank was established on 13th October, 1990 in the administrative district of Badulla increasing the number of RRDBs to 12. In addition, 12 branches were opened during 1990 by the RRDBs of Badulla, (Badulla, Welimada, Diyatalawa and Passara), Kurunegala (Ibbagamuwa), Hambantota (Suriyawewa), Puttalam (Mundailama and Nawagaththegama), Kandy (Katugastota), Nuwara-Eliya (Nildandahinna and Agarapathana) and Moneragala (Thanamalwila). The Panawala branch of the RRDB Kegalle was amalgamated with its Ruwanwella Branch for security reasons in 1990. Accordingly, the total number of RRDB branches which stood at 89 at the end of 1989 rose to 100 by the end of 1990. Data on expansion of RRDBs and their branches since 1985, are given in Table 2.8.

* The amalgamation of the Panawala & Ruwanwella branches of the RRDB Kegalle during 1990 reduced the No. of branches by one.

Deposit Mobilization

Significant progress was made by the RRDBs in the mobilization of deposits during 1990. Total deposits which amounted to Rs.176 million in 199,559 accounts as at the end of 1989 increased to Rs.314 million in 309,616 accounts by the end of 1990. This reflected a growth in deposit mobilization of 78 per cent as compared to an increase of 55 per cent in the previous year. The increase in the number of deposit accounts in the RRDBs reflected the attempts made by each bank in promoting the savings habit among the rural people in the respective areas of operation which were mostly unbanked or underbanked previously and the expansion of RRDB facilities with the opening of new

XXII

branches. Continuing the general trend that existed during the recent past, approximately 86 per cent of the total deposits Of RRDBs comprised savings deposits, while the balance 14 per cent comprised fixed and other deposits. The average value of deposit per account rose from Rs.882/- in 1989 to Rs. 1,014/- in 1990 reflecting an increasing propensity to save among rural people. The comparatively lower average value of deposit per account, both savings and fixed deposits of RRDBs, further indicate their outreach to the poorer segments of the rural sector. The average deposits per RRDB branch increased from Rs.2 million in 1989 to Rs.3.1 million in 1990 confirming this favourable trend.

Delivery of Credit

With relatively settled conditions prevailing in the country, the year 1990 witnessed a considerable expansion in loan operations of the RRDBs. The number of loans granted increased from 20,640 to 47,616 and the value of loans granted rose from Rs.155 million to Rs.430 million during the year 1990. The significant increase in the number of loans granted in 1990 can be mainly attributed to the large number of loans disbursed to Janasaviya beneficiaries, especially to start new self-employment projects. This revealed the continuing and increasing participation of RRDBs in the process of credit delivery to the rural sector. The average size of loans rose to Rs.9,026/- in 1990 from Rs.7,493/- in 1989, while the average credit per branch has been stepped up from Rs.1.7 million in 1989 to Rs.4.3 million in 1990. In addition, a total of Rs.94 million was granted as loans against the pledge of gold articles (pawning) during 1990 compared to Rs.35 million in

1989, showing an increase of 166 per cent. However, some RRDBs did not engage in pawning activities primarily due to security reasons.

As in the past years, the RRDBs continued to provide loans to a wide spectrum of economic activities including agriculture, fisheries,, livestock, small industries and trade. During 1990, the highest proportion of loans (65. per cent) was disbursed to the agriculture sector, while 11 per cent and 10 per cent of total loans were disbursed to the trade and commerce and small industries sectors, respectively.

Other Activities

During the period under review, RRDBs expanded their activities to areas such as the promotion of self employment schemes through funding, conducting of farmer training programmes, assisting farmers in the marketing of their products, collecting data on resource availability, etc. In addition, the RRDBs performed an important role in delivering credit to the under-privileged in the rural sector under several state sponsored and foreign funded credit programmes. The Janasaviya programme, the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project (SFLC) funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and UNICEF funded programmes are some of them. The Kurunegala RRDB Was selected as a participatory credit institution under the Small and Medium Industry (SMI) HI credit scheme in February 1990. It was the first RRDB to gain entry into the SMI Scheme. During 1990y 67 loans amounting to Rs.4.2 million were granted by the RRDB Kurunegala to agriculture, industry, livestock and trade sectors under this, credit scheme.

Other innovative banking practices introduced by the RRDBs such as the Group Lending Scheme, Minor/School Children's Deposit Scheme, Development Deposit Scheme and the concept of 'Janahamuwa' continued to be popular among the rural people as reflected in the substantial increase in the number of customers of these banks during

1990. '

xxiii

During the period under review, RRDBs were able to create approximately 43,000 new employment opportunities through their loan operations and the aggregate of new employment generated from the inception of RRDBs upto the end of 1990 stood at around 425,000 thus highlighting the contributions of RRDBs in creating employment opportunities in the rural sector.

Continuing efforts were made by the Central Bank during 1990 to direct the RRDBs towards the objective of promoting rural banking. Apart from its advisory role and directions issued to these banks from time to time, the Central Bank officials made visits to almost all the RRDBs to review the work programme and also to motivate the staff and the large number of beneficiaries of these banks. During these project and field visits, the Central Bank officers also attended credit meetings 'Janahamuwas' and borrowers' training programmes organised by some RRDBs. These meetings have provided a useful forum to discuss problems being encountered by the rural people in obtaining banking services, especially, credit for production activities. In the follow up process that is set in motion by these credit meetings, Janahamuwa, etc. substantial headway has been made in overcoming the major obstacles in delivering credit to the rural sector.

RURAL BANKING AND STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

The Rural Banking and Staff Training College (RB & STC) continued to expand its training activities in 1990. During the year, the RB & STC conducted 51 training courses for 1,608 persons, which is a significant increase over the 39 courses conducted for 853 persons in 1989. Out of the 51 training courses conducted in 1990,30 were conducted in outstations to help 902 small scale entrepreneurs and self-employed persons to develop their entrepreneurial and managerial skills. Among these persons, 810 were beneficiaries of Regional Rural Development Banks. The balance 21 training courses were intended to train the officials of the banking and allied sectors which were targetted to a total of 706 persons consisting of % Central Bank officers, 428 commercial bankers, 43 regional rural development bankers and 139 officers from other financial institutions and agencies such as finance companies, the National Savings Bank and the 'Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project'.

Rural banking, project-oriented development, commercial banking, international trade, exchange operations, hire-purchase and lease financing, management, training of trainers, monitoring and evaluation of projects, communication and small-scale entrepreneur development were the main areas of training provided in 1990. The latter 4 areas of training were entirely new additions to the RB & STC Training Programme. In addition to the courses scheduled for 1990, the College conducted several special training courses on request. These included training courses for the beneficiaries of the National Savings Bank's Rural Credit Pilot Project in the Matara District; training courses for officers attached to the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project; training courses on the Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House and the seminar on Foreign Exchange, Money Market and Capital Market Derivatives and Instruments. The latter was conducted on the request of an organizing body consisting of the Association of Professional Bankers - Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka FOREX Club.

During the year, the RB & STC responded to the rising demand for training by publishing a training calendar with definite objectives of training courses and their course content well elaborated and several training reports on selected training courses conducted by the College. These reports provide necessary guidance to the trainers of

XXIV

others agencies to conduct similar training courses, notably at district and village levels. The College also conducted its 9th Anniversary Lecture on 30th August, 1990, on "Re­orienting the Banking Policy to Meet the Needs of the People' and it was delivered by Dr.H.N.S.Karunatilake, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Of this increase, Rs.8,508 million or 21 per cent was on account of exchange rate depreciation. The outstanding foreign debt accounted for 56 per cent of the total, while the share of the domestic debt was 44 per cent.

In order to meet the budgetary requirements, Rs. 12,847 million worth of government Rupee Securities were floated during the year. The total repayment of rupee loans and the interest paid during 1990 amounted to Rs.7,854 million and Rs.6,857 million, respectively.

REGIONAL OFFICES - MATARA, ANURADHAPURA & MATALE

In pursuance of the Central Bank's role in rural development, the three Regional Offices of the Bank at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale continued their development activities at an accelerated pace in 1990 facilitated by the relatively stable civil conditions that prevailed in the country as compared with 1989.

During the period under review, the attention of the Regional Offices was directed mainly towards project identification, appraisal and recommendation of viable projects for bank financing under the various refinance schemes, post supervision of such projects in order to ensure successful completion and repayment of loans on schedule, conducting of training programmes for entrepreneur development and educating the public regarding various rural credit schemes in order to ensure optimum utilisation of credit. Among the various refinance schemes implemented by the Central Bank, the main emphasis of the Regional Offices was on the implementation of the Self-Employment and Village Adoption Scheme which was replaced in August, 1990 by the All Island Self-Employment Loan Scheme. Grant of credit under this scheme expanded substantially during 1990, largely due to the resumption of field visits which was made possible by the cessation of civil disturbances in the respective regions.

Under this Scheme, the Matara Regional Office recommended 1,179 project loans valued at Rs.8.4 million for bank financing in 1990. This reflects an appreciable improvement as compared with the previous year's 179 projects totalling only Rs.2.2 million. As for the other refinance schemes, such as Tea Small Holder Development Project, Mid-Country Perennial Crop Development Project and Inland Bills Scheme, the Matara Regional Office also conducted several seminars and workshops in order to increase the awareness of bankers, the public and other related agencies for ensuring the smooth implementation of these new schemes in the period ahead.

The Anuradhapura Regional Office recommended to the commercial banks for financing a total of 756 small scale development projects valued at Rs.13.6 million under the Self-Employment and Village Adoption Credit Scheme during the year 1990, as against a total of 297 loans totalling Rs.4.3 million recommended in 1989, Of the total number, 612 projects or 80 per cent was in respect of agriculture related activities and 84 projects or 11 per cent was for animal husbandry. The Anuradhapura Regional Office also implemented a special project to promote Big Onion cultivation on an experimental basis in the 1990 Yala season.

The Matale Regional Office sponsored 542 Self-Employment Project Loans valued at Rs.8.5 million to the banks for financing during the year 1990 as against 259 loans totalling Rs.2.9 million in the previous year, which was an increase of 109 per cent in the number of loans recommended. A Special Animal Husbandry Project was undertaken by the Matale Regional Office to develop the economy of three villages in the Kandy and Matale districts. During the year 1990, a total of 143 animal husbandry project loans to the value of Rs.2 million were recommended to the banks by the Matale Regional Office as against 61 projects valued at Rs.0.8 million recommended in 1989. Under the All Island Farm Machinery Loan Scheme, 65 projects valued at Rs.1.1 million were recommended to banks by the Regional Office. The bulk of these loans was for the purchase of water pumps by the Janasaviya recipients which helped them to engage in productive agricultural projects. The Matale Regional Office also paid special attention to providing credit facilities for Big Onion cultivation during the Yala Season and also

XXX

for the marketing of this product at a reasonable price. This Office also carried out 68 field inspections in respect of Tea Small Holder Development Project Credit Scheme and recommended 38 applications to the banks for funding.

As in the past, the Regional Offices continued to; hold credit camps for the distribution of agricultural loans. The Anuradhapura and the Matale Regional Offices conducted 2 and 10 such camps, respectively, in their regions during the year 1990.

In addition to the activities involving the expansion of credit facilities to priority sectors, the three Regional Offices organised and conducted beneficiary training programmes, seminars and workshops with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture for the purpose of upgrading the knowledge and technical skills of the rural farming community and on the effective use of agricultural, practices to ensure optimum production.

During the year under review, 30 "Janahamuwas" and 24 Agricultural Training Classes were conducted by the Anuradhapura Regional Office. The Matale Regional Office conducted 11 seminars and training programmes, of which 8 were mainly for the benefit of Janasaviya recipients. Further, 17 village level meetings were held by them to identify problems relating to the paucity of credit for self-employment projects at the grassroots level.

During the year 1990, all three Regional Offices organised credit meetings in their respective regions with the participation of the concerned Central Bank officials and representatives of commercial banks in the area to focus on constraints in the credit delivery mechanism. As a result of these meetings, it has been possible, with the co­operation of the commercial banks, to bring about a more conducive environment for the extension of credit in rural areas. The Regional Offices also participated in several Mobile Presidential and Ministerial Services held during, the year in their respective regions and have rendered numerous services that were needed from the Bank.

With the implementation of the first phase of the Janasaviya Programme, the attention of the Bank has been focused towards generating self-employment opportunities for Janasaviya beneficiaries. The Regional Offices have been encouraged to contribute towards this effort by organising village level meetings/workshops to educate and motivate beneficiaries and also to identify credit related problems faced by them. The Anuradhapura Regional Office conducted 7 such meetings while the Matara & Matale Regional Offices also conducted several training programmes for Janasaviya beneficiaries in their regions. Further, the Anuradhapura and Matale Regional Offices recommended to lending banks, 97 and 371 projects, respectively for Janasaviya beneficiaries.

The Anuradhapura and Matara Regional Offices commenced currency operations on 1st June and 2nd July 1990, respectively, with a view to facilitating the currency needs of the people of the area and the commercial bank branches located in the regions. The exchange counters set up at these offices especially for the provision of hew notes, have become increasingly popular with the trading community as well as among the general public. It also provides a useful service to banks and other credit institutions in the area not only by serving the growing currency requirements but also by providing safe deposit facilities for surplus cash.

The Regional Offices continued the sale of Treasury bills during 1990. The Matara Regional Office marketed Treasury bills to the value of Rs.127 million in 1990, showing an increase of 22 per cent compared with the previous year. Treasury bills to the value of Rs. 1,585 million and Rs. 1,723 million were sold by Anuradhapura and Matale Regional Offices, respectively, reflecting decreases of 36 per cent and 44 per cent over the previous year.

The Regional Cheque Clearing for commercial banks by the Central Bank Regional Offices expanded during the year 1990. In all, 100,508 cheques to the value of Rs.1,390 million had been cleared in the Regional Clearing House at Matara, while Anuradhapura Clearing House cleared 69,615 cheques valued at Rs.1,192 million. The two Clearing Houses at Kandy and Matale attached to the Matale Regional Office cleared a total of 312,247 cheques valued at Rs.6,612 million in 1990:
