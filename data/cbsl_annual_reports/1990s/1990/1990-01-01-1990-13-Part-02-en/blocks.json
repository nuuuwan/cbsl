The RRDBs in the Puttalam and Nuwara-Eliya districts opened 2 branches each. The RRDB Kegalle amalgamated its Panwala branch with its Ruwanwella branch, reducing the number of its branches to 10. Consequent to these changes, the total number of operative RRDB branches rose to 100 at the end of 1990. The National Savings Bank opened 7 new branches increasing its total number of branches to 76 by the end 1990.",

Seven claims amounting to Rs.0.22 million were rejected on account of non-compliance with the Central Bank's operating instructions. Loans relating to 16 claims with a Central Bank's liability of Rs.0.24 million were fully repaid by the borrowers after submission of claim applications, while one claim amounting to Rs.0.27 million was deferred owing to rescheduling of the loan by the PCI.

During these project and field visits, the Central Bank officers also attended credit meetings 'Janahamuwas' and borrowers' training programmes organised by some RRDBs. These meetings have provided a useful forum to discuss problems being encountered by the rural people in obtaining banking services, especially, credit for production activities.

A major development observed during the year was the achievement of faster clearing. All cheques received by the Clearing House upto S p.m. each day were processed and returned by 10 p.m. on the same day to enable the commercial banks to despatch same to outstations. While some banks collected their items on the same night, others were able to collect them only at 6 a.m. the following morning. A total of 48 more branches was brought into the one day clearing schedule, bringing the cumulative total number of banks/branches on the one day clearing schedule to 193. Galle District has been brought into a 3 day clearing schedule and all other outstation branches except the branches in the North and East are now on a five day clearing schedule. The total number of cheques and drafts cleared by the SLACH increased from 12 million (Rs.367 billion) in 1989 to 14 million (Rs.528 billion) in 1990.",
