BALANCE OF PAYMENTS

OVERALL TRENDS

A significant improvement in the country's balance of payments position was a note­worthy feature of Sri Lanka's economic performance in 1990. The introduction of a more market oriented exchange rate system, further liberalization of external transactions, structural adjustment measures undertaken to improve economic performance, buoyant tea prices, recovery of the tourism sector, greater utilization of foreign assistance and the recovery in economic activities in general following improvements in the security situa­tion, were among the factors contributing to an improved balance of payments out-turn. In 1990, the overall balance recorded a surplus of SDR 130 million (Rs. 6,998 million), in contrast to large deficits recorded in each of the preceding five years. The improved balance of payments performance in 1990 was in spite of the adverse impactof the Gulf crisis, in particular, the higher petroleum prices.

In this climate, while the trade deficit declined from SDR 530 million (Rs. 24,050 million) in 1989 to SDR 518 million (Rs. 28,124 million) in 1990, the deficit in the services account registered a substantial reduction, from SDR 123 million (Rs. 5,609 million) in 1989 to SDR 56 million (Rs. 3,040 million) in 1990. Meanwhile, the net receipts on account of private transfers rose from SDR 258 million (Rs. 11,840 million) to SDR 274 million (Rs. 14,813 million) partly due to the accelerated repatriation of earnings by Sri Lankans working in the Middle East Gross private transfers totalled SDR 297 million (Rs. 16,071 million) in 1990, compared with a total of SDR 279 million (Rs. 12,830 million) in 1989. Official transfers, however, decreased by SDR 24 million to SDR 123 million (Rs. 6,698 million) in 1990. Notwithstanding this, the current account deficit was contained at SDR 177 million (Rs. 9,653 million) compared to a deficit of SDR 248 million (Rs. 11,069 million) in 1989 (Table 1.42). As a ratio of GDP the current account deficit declined from 4.4 per cent in 1989 to 3.0 per cent in 1990. Meanwhile, the net non-monetary capital inflows increased by 38 per cent to SDR 297 million in 1990, mainly due to increased utilization of foreign loans by the central government.

The achievements on the balance of payments front were particularly commendable when the improvements in the external reserves position were considered. In all, gross official reserves rose by SDR 79 million (Rs. 5,645 million) in 1990, as against an increase of SDR 17 million (Rs. 2,494 million) recorded in 1989. Similarly, the country's total gross external assets increased from SDR .447 million (Rs.23,390 million) at the end of 1989 to SDR 599 million (Rs. 34,271 million) at the end of 1990. This level of gross reserves was sufficient to finance 3.6 months of imports projected for 1991.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS OUTTURN

Merchandise Account

Export earnings grew by 21 per cent and reached SDR 1,456 million in 1990 as compared with an increase of 10 per cent in 1989. This was the highest annual growth in export earnings experienced during the past 5 years. All major categories of exports, excluding rubber and coconut, recorded significant growth rates in 1990. Non-traditional exports appeared to. have responded positively to the adjustment measures undertaken

since 1989. However, mainly due to high commitments on crude oil imports, expenditure on imports also rose by 14 per cent in 1990 to SDR 1,974 million compared to only a 4 per cent growth in 1989 (Table 1.42). These developments resulted in a deficit of SDR 518 million in the merchandise account in 1990, which is marginally lower than the deficit of SDR 530 million in the previous year.

Services Account

The services account showed a considerable improvement with its deficit declining from SDR 123 million in 1989 to SDR 56 million in 1990 (Table 1.43). Major improve­ments were recorded in net foreign exchange inflows in the travel and port, transportation and insurance categories. The gross foreign exchange receipts on account of travel rose from SDR 59 million in 1989 to SDR 102 million in 1990, recording an increase of 73 per cent. This was mainly due to a substantial recovery in tourism reflected in a 60 per cent increase in tourist arrivals in 1990. Accordingly, the travel account showed over a seven-fold increase in net receipts, from SDR 6 million in 1989 to SDR 44 million in 1990. Reflecting the increase in the volume of trade and of freight rates, outlays on account of freight increased. However, with increased earnings from passenger fares exceeding such outlays, the port, transportation and insurance category recorded a sur­plus of SDR 8 million in 1990 as compared with a deficit of SDR 8 million in 1989.

The net outflow of foreign exchange on account of investment income declined by 12 per cent, from SDR 124 million in 1989 to SDR 109 million in 1990. Repatriation of profits and dividends, however, increased to SDR 20 million in 1990 from SDR 14 million in 1989. While interest payments rose marginally from SDR 156 million in 1989 to SDR 160 million in 1990, interest receipts on foreign investments increased consider­ably from SDR 46 million in 1989 to SDR 70 million in 1990, reflecting the improve­ment in the country's external assets position. Thus, net interest payments decreased from SDR 111 million in 1989 to SDR 89 million in 1990.

Transfers Account

Total net receipts on account of transfers decreased marginally in 1990 to SDR 397 million from SDR 405 million in 1989. Net private transfers increased by. 6 per cent, to SDR 274 million in 1990. Worker remittances accounted for the major share of private transfers. Worker remittances, which showed an increasing trend during the first half of the year, did not decline as expected during the latter part of the year, owing to the accelerated repatriation of earnings by workers in the Middle East, following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait Official transfers, however, decreased from SDR 147 million in

1989 to SDR 123 million in 1990.

Current Account

The improvements in the trade and services accounts resulted in a significant reduc­tion in the current account deficit from SDR 248 million (Rs. 11,069 million) in 1989 to SDR 177 million (Rs. 9,653 million) in 1990. In fact this was the lowest deficit recorded during the past six years. As a ratio to GDP, the deficit declined from 4.4 per cent in the previous year to 3.0 per cent in 1990, again the lowest on record since the tea boom of 1984. This ratio excluding grants, declined by two percentage points, to 5.1 percent in 1990 from 7.1 per cent in the previous year. This significant reduction in the current account deficit was an outstanding feature of balance of payments developments in 1990.

Capital Account

The net non-monetary capital inflows in 1990 increased by 37 per cent to SDR 297 million. Private direct investment rose marginally from SDR 14 million in 1989 to SDR IS million during 1990. As in the previous year, there was a net outflow on account of loan capital in the private sector due to amortization payments. However, the gross inflow of loan capital to the private sector increased from SDR 10 million in 1989 to SDR 17 million in 1990, as reflected in higher borrowings by GCEC enterprises from Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs). The net utilization of short term credits by the private sector decreased from SDR 72 million in 1989 to SDR 49 million in 1990. The decline was mainly reflected in the utilization of normal trade credits by the private sector excluding the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

Inflow of net non-monetary capital to the government increased from SDR 169 million in 1989 to SDR 264 million in 1990 due to larger disbursements of foreign loans as well as a reduction in amortization payments. While gross disbursements increased from SDR 291 million in 1989 to SDR 356 million in 1990, amortization payments decreased from SDR 122 million to SDR 92 million between the two years, mainly due to a reduction in repayment of non-concessional loans. Total disbursements included a sum of SDR 66 million received for structural adjustment from the Asian Development Bank and the International Development Association as balance of payments support loans under the Agriculture Programme (SDR 10 million), Financial Sector Programme (SDR 24.5 million) and Economic Restructuring Credit (SDR 31.4 million).

EXTERNAL ASSETS

Sri Lanka's gross external assets stood at SDR 599 million at the end of 1990, recording an increase of SDR 152 million over the level that prevailed at the end of the previous year (Table 1.44). Official reserves comprising foreign assets of the government and the Central Bank increased by SDR 79 million during the year to reach SDR 302 million by the end of 1990. This was entirely reflected in foreign assets of the Central Bank which rose from SDR 191 million at the end of 1989 to SDR 286 million at the end of 1990. Assets held by the government decreased by SDR 17 million during the year. Foreign assets held by commercial banks increased during the year by SDR 73 million to reach SDR 296 million by the end of 1990.

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS

The Sri Lanka Rupee depreciated against all major currencies in 1990. However, the rate of depreciation was lower than in 1989, except against the Pound Sterling. The Sri Lanka Rupee depreciated against the Japanese Yen, Deutsche Mark, French Franc, and Pound Sterling, by 4.3 per cent, 9.4 per cent, 10.1 per cent and 14.0 per cent, respec­tively, while appreciating by 5.7 per cent against the Indian Rupee. It depreciated margin­ally by 0.6 per cent against the intervention currency, the US Dollar, while depreciating considerably by 7.5 per cent against the SDR during 1990 (Table 1.45).

Sri Lanka's Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) defined as the trade-weighted nominal exchange rate with respect to major trading partners, depreciated by 8.9 per cent on a point to point basis in 1990. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), which is the nominal exchange rate adjusted for inflation differentials between Sri Lanka and her major trading partners, appreciated by 4.8 per cent on a point to point basis during the year. The annual average NEER depreciated by 13.4 per cent, while the annual average REER appreciated by 5.2 per cent in 1990.

EXTERNAL DEBT

Sri Lanka's total outstanding foreign debt was estimated at SDR 4,162 million at the end of 1990 indicating an increase of SDR 203 million during the year. As in the previous years, medium and long term debt of the government accounted for a major share of the total debt. The amount of outstanding medium and long term foreign debt of the government increased from SDR 2,976 million in 1989 to SDR 3,197 million in 1990, and accounted for 83 per cent of the total medium and long term debt Total outstand­ing debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the end of 1990 was SDR 288 million as compared to SDR 275 million at the end of the previous year. This included the third and final disbursement of SDR 44.5 million under the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) arrangement with the IMF. The outstanding level of short term debt decreased marginally to SDR 311 million in 1990 from SDR 312 million in 1989.

DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS

Debt service payments, which include amortization of medium and long term loans and interest payments on all foreign loans, decreased by SDR 69 million, from SDR 375 million in 1989 to SDR 306 million in 1990 (Table 1.47). Decreases were observed in both amortization and interest payments. Amortization payments decreased by SDR 46 million to SDR 172 million in 1990 mainly due to a reduction in such payments of the government, while interest payments declined by SDR 23 million to SDR 134 million between the two years . Repayments in respect of IMF loans decreased from SDR 46 million in 1989 to SDR 31 million in 1990, while interest payments decreased from SDR 23 million in 1989 to SDR 21 million in 1990. The debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from exports of goods and services declined from 24.6 per cent in 1989 to 16.5 per cent in 1990 reflecting both a reduction in debt service payments and increased export receipts. The debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from exports of goods and services and private transfers was 14.2 per cent in 1990 as against 20.8 per cent in 1989.
