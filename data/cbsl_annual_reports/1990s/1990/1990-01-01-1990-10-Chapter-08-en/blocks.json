    "text": "A significant improvement in the country's balance of payments position was a note\u00adworthy feature of Sri Lanka's economic performance in 1990. The introduction of a more market oriented exchange rate system, further liberalization of external transactions, structural adjustment measures undertaken to improve economic performance, buoyant tea prices, recovery of the tourism sector, greater utilization of foreign assistance and the recovery in economic activities in general following improvements in the security situa\u00adtion, were among the factors contributing to an improved balance of payments out-turn. In 1990, the overall balance recorded a surplus of SDR 130 million (Rs. 6,998 million), in contrast to large deficits recorded in each of the preceding five years. The improved balance of payments performance in 1990 was in spite of the adverse impactof the Gulf crisis, in particular, the higher petroleum prices.",

Meanwhile, the net receipts on account of private transfers rose from SDR 258 million (Rs. 11,840 million) to SDR 274 million (Rs. 14,813 million) partly due to the accelerated repatriation of earnings by Sri Lankans working in the Middle East Gross private transfers totalled SDR 297 million (Rs. 16,071 million) in 1990, compared with a total of SDR 279 million (Rs. 12,830 million) in 1989. Official transfers, however, decreased by SDR 24 million to SDR 123 million (Rs. 6,698 million) in 1990. Notwithstanding this, the current account deficit was contained at SDR 177 million (Rs. 9,653 million) compared to a deficit of SDR 248 million (Rs. 11,069 million) in 1989 (Table 1.42). As a ratio of GDP the current account deficit declined from 4.4 per cent in 1989 to 3.0 per cent in 1990. Meanwhile, the net non-monetary capital inflows increased by 38 per cent to SDR 297 million in 1990, mainly due to increased utilization of foreign loans by the central government.",

Major improve\u00adments were recorded in net foreign exchange inflows in the travel and port, transportation and insurance categories. The gross foreign exchange receipts on account of travel rose from SDR 59 million in 1989 to SDR 102 million in 1990, recording an increase of 73 per cent. This was mainly due to a substantial recovery in tourism reflected in a 60 per cent increase in tourist arrivals in 1990. Accordingly, the travel account showed over a seven-fold increase in net receipts, from SDR 6 million in 1989 to SDR 44 million in 1990. Reflecting the increase in the volume of trade and of freight rates, outlays on account of freight increased. However, with increased earnings from passenger fares exceeding such outlays, the port, transportation and insurance category recorded a sur\u00adplus of SDR 8 million in 1990 as compared with a deficit of SDR 8 million in 1989.",

In fact this was the lowest deficit recorded during the past six years. As a ratio to GDP, the deficit declined from 4.4 per cent in the previous year to 3.0 per cent in 1990, again the lowest on record since the tea boom of 1984. This ratio excluding grants, declined by two percentage points, to 5.1 percent in 1990 from 7.1 per cent in the previous year. This significant reduction in the current account deficit was an outstanding feature of balance of payments developments in 1990.",

The amount of outstanding medium and long term foreign debt of the government increased from SDR 2,976 million in 1989 to SDR 3,197 million in 1990, and accounted for 83 per cent of the total medium and long term debt Total outstand\u00ading debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the end of 1990 was SDR 288 million as compared to SDR 275 million at the end of the previous year.

Decreases were observed in both amortization and interest payments. Amortization payments decreased by SDR 46 million to SDR 172 million in 1990 mainly due to a reduction in such payments of the government, while interest payments declined by SDR 23 million to SDR 134 million between the two years . Repayments in respect of IMF loans decreased from SDR 46 million in 1989 to SDR 31 million in 1990, while interest payments decreased from SDR 23 million in 1989 to SDR 21 million in 1990. The debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from exports of goods and services declined from 24.6 per cent in 1989 to 16.5 per cent in 1990 reflecting both a reduction in debt service payments and increased export receipts. The debt service payments as a ratio of receipts from exports of goods and services and private transfers was 14.2 per cent in 1990 as against 20.8 per cent in 1989.",
