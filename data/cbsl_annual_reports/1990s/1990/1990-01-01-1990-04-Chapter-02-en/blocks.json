The favourable weather and the improvement in the security condition in most parts of the country enabled a strong recovery of the agriculture sector, which accounts for about a fourth of Sri Lanka's GNP. The volume of output of the agriculture sector, inclusive of forestry and fishing, is estimated to have increased by 8.8 per cent in 1990. Its contribu\u00adtion towards the overall GNP growth was 31 per cent The manufacturing sector, which has maintained a consistent growth momentum in the recent past, continued to be buoy\u00adant in 1990. Led by increased industrial exports, the manufacturing sector is estimated to have recorded a growth of 9.4 per cent in 1990, while its contribution to the growth in GNP was 25 per cent.",
