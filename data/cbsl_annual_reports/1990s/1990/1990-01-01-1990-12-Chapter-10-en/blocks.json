    "text": "An acceleration in the rate of growth of broad money supply, mainly caused by substantial increases in external assets (net) of the banking system and domestic credit was the main feature of the monetary developments in 1990. The narrow money supply (M,), consisting of currency and demand deposits held by the public, registered an annual growth rate of 13 per cent at the end of 1990 compared with 9 per cent at the end of 1989. However, the M, growth recorded large fluctuations during the year, the annual rate rising from 9 per cent at the end of 1989 to 17 per cent by the end of April, 1990 but declining to 7 per cent at the end of October before increasing to 13 per cent by the end of December, 1990. Meanwhile, the broad money supply (Mj), comprising M, plus time and savings deposits held by the public with commercial banks increased from an annual rate of 12 per cent to 19 per cent over the two years. However, unlike in the case of M, , the annual rate of growth of Mj stood within a range of 15-17 per cent between February and November, 1990 before expanding by 2 percentage points in December to reach 19 per cent by the end of 1990.",

The increases in Treasury bill holdings of commercial banks by Rs.5,124 million and provisional advances from the Central Bank by Rs.3,563 million including Rs.3,055 million as a special loan arising from revaluation adjustment of the liabilities to the IMF including quota were mainly responsible for the growth in gross credit to government. However , the last mentioned item is not directly attributable to budgetary operations during the year and, therefore, the growth in NCG resulting from budgetary operations was of a very small magnitude.",

The expansion in economic activities following the improvement in the business climate and favourable weather conditions, and enhanced working capital requirements as a consequence of upward revisions in electricity and petroleum prices were largely responsible for the high credit demand of the private sector in 1990.",

Credit extended by commercial banks to other private sector constituents rose by Rs. 12,273 million or 24 per cent in 1990. The compa\u00adrable growth in 1989 was Rs.2,465 million or 5 per cent. Meanwhile, bank credit to public corporations expanded by Rs.1,774 million or 13 per cent which was lower than the increase of Rs.3,075 million or 29 per cent recorded in 1989. The major borrowers were the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE), the Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB) and the State Plantation Corporation which raised their outstanding credit levels by Rs.1,224 million, Rs.610 million and Rs.237 million, respectively. The in\u00adcreased credit utilization by the CWE was mainly for financing essential food imports and the maintenance of buffer stocks which were previously handled by the Food Commissioner. Bank credit to the co-operative sector which dropped by Rs.140 million or 11 per cent in 1989, expanded by Rs.419 million or 36 per cent in 1990 mainly on account of enhanced credit demand for the purchase of agricultural commodities, as well as the increased credit requirements for procuring agricultural inputs, particularly ferti\u00adlizer, following the removal of the fertilizer subsidy in 1990.",

Altogether, NFA increased by Rs.5,474 million or 116 per cent in 1990 as against a decline of Rs.2,326 million or 33 per cent in 1989. The expansion in NFA consisted of increases in the assets of the Central Bank by Rs.2,996 million or 179 per cent and those of the commercial banks by Rs.2,478 million or 81 per cent. The growth in cash and balances abroad, together with foreign government securities and Treasury bills by Rs.4,016 million and Rs.2,856 million, respectively and a significant drop in borrowings abroad by Rs.2,631 million were the major contributory factors for the expansion in NFA of the Central Bank. However, the impact of these increases on the NFA of the Central Bank was substantially mitigated by an increase in the deposits of international organizations by Rs.6,069 million. Meanwhile, the enhanced net external assets of commercial banks during the year was mainly reflected in increases in cash with banks abroad and money held with the FCBUs of Rs.1,146 million and Rs.3,418 million, respectively, off-set partly by an increase in foreign exchange liabilities of Rs.2,736 million. A favourable balance of payments outturn together with increased availability of lines of credit enabled the increased accumulation of foreign assets in the banking system during the year.",

The number of commercial banks (excluding RRDBs) operating in Sri Lanka remained unchanged at 24 during the year. However, in 1990, all banking institu\u00adtions recorded a higher rate of expansion in terms of branches compared to that of the previous year (Table 1.61). Raising the total number of bank branches to 918 by the end of the year, 48 branches were established in 1990. This included 28 domestic and 2 foreign commercial bank branches, 11 RRDB branches and 7 National Savings Bank (NSB) branches. The considerable expansion in the branch network reflected the en\u00adhanced competition among financial institutions following the improvement in the secu\u00adrity situation in most parts of the country.",

Loans and advances to the government increased by Rs.3,562 million (47 per cent) mainly due to a special loan given to the government amounting to Rs.3,055 million in June, 1990 subsequent to the revaluation adjustment which took place with respect to the liabilities to the IMF including quota while holdings of government and government guaranteed securities decreased by Rs.2,097 million (-7.2 per cent). Meanwhile, advances to commercial banks and other financial institutions increased by Rs.3,018 million (70 per cent) in 1990, mainly due to the growth in short-term refinance loans which'amounted to Rs.2,045 million during the year. The other assets and accounts of the Bank expanded by Rs;3,773 million (32 per cent) during the year, compared with an increase of Rs.4,332 million (58 per cent)in 1989.",

Hence, in addition to those in place by the end of 1989, the following policy measures were adopted during the year. First, Bank rate was raised upward by 1 percentage point to IS pa- cent in July, 1990.

Meanwhile, the non-market oriented credit control policy measures such as the partial credit ceiling and the 100 per cent margin requirement against Letters of Credit on non-essential imports introduced in 1989 woe continued in 1990 as short-term corrective measures since the inflationary situation did not improve to a satisfactory level to discontinue them.
