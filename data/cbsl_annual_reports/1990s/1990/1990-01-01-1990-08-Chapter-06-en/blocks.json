Consequently, the price of rice also remained high during the year in spite of the satisfactory paddy harvest recorded in 1990, due to the substitution effect of the rise in wheat flour prices and the increase in cost of production due to higher fertilizer prices. Substantial price increases were also recorded for major food items like fish, beef, vegetables, potatoes and red onions during the year. Moderation in the prices of agricultural commodities like dried chillies, vegetables and potatoes during the Yala season was largely responsible for the dampening of price increases during the period July to October.

From January 1990, a special allowance of Rs. 200 was paid to employees who were on a combined initial salary step of Rs. 2,000 or less, while from November of the year a further allowance of Rs. 300 or Rs. 200 was payable to those on a combined initial salary step of Rs. 2,000 or less or between Rs. 2,001 and 3,000, respectively. However, despite these allowances there was a significant deterioration of real wages by 7.1 per cent in the overall public sector during the year. Real wages in the public sector declined by 2.8 per cent in 1989.",
