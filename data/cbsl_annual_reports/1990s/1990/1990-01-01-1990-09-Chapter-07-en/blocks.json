The value of merchandise exports grew impressively by 20 per cent in SDR terms, as compared with an 11 per cent growth in 1989. On the other hand, the outlay on imports rose by 14 per cent as against a 5 per cent increase in 1989. Accordingly, the trade deficit was contained at almost the same level as in 1989, which was however, a reduction of 8 per cent over 1988. On the other hand, the ratio of export earnings to import payments rose significantly from 70 per cent in 1989 to 74 per cent in 1990.",

However, when Customs data are adjusted for lags and other factors pertaining to recording, total imports amounted to Rs. 107,729 million (SDR 1,980 million) and exports to Rs.79,481 million (SDR 1,461 million). Accordingly, the adjusted data reflected a trade deficit of Rs.28,248 million (SDR 519 million), compared with a deficit of Rs.24,050 million (SDR 521 million) in 1989.",

This compares with a growth of 16 per cent in the previous year. The higher growth rate was reflected in all categories of industrial products, namely, textiles and garments, petroleum products and other industrial products. Textile and garment exports rose by 21 per cent, from SDR 382 million to SDR 462 million, between the two years. The value of petroleum exports rose by 49 per cent from SDR 49 million to SDR 73 million, due mainly to increased petroleum prices consequent to the Gulf crisis. The value of other industrial products also increased by 22 per cent reflecting increased earnings from chemical products, leather and rubber products and marine prod\u00aducts.",

In the food and drink category, the expenditure on wheat flour imports recorded an almost seven fold increase, from SDR 4 million (Rs.175 million) to SDR 26 million (Rs.1,388 million), due to an eight-fold increase in volume, from 17,025 metric tons to 128,736 metric tons. The value of rice imports, however, fell sharply by 56 per cent from, SDR 74 million (Rs.3,397 million) to SDR 32 million (Rs.1,758 million ) between the two years, due to a sharp reduction in the volume of imports, from 315,959 metric tons to 171,962 metric tons. Meanwhile, the value of sugar imports rose marginally, from SDR 94 million (Rs.4,326 million) to SDR 95 million (Rs.5,173 million), due entirely to a rise in the price by 7 per cent, from SDR 292 per metric ton to SDR 311 per metric ton. In contrast, the volume of imports declined by 5 per cent, from 320,403 to 305,324 metric tons between the two years. The value of other consumer goods imports increased by 24 per cent, from SDR 169 million (Rs.7,826 million ) to SDR 210 million (Rs.11,438 million) due mainly to a rise in the outlay on motor cars and cycle imports by 29 per cent, from SDR 62 million (Rs.2,886 million) to SDR 80 million (Rs.4,330 million) between the two years.",

The ouday on fertilizer imports also, rose sharply by 43 per cent, from SDR 38 million (Rs.1,755 million) to SDR 54 million (Rs.2,958 million) due to a substantial increase in the quantity by 42 per cent, from 354,900 metric tons to 504,669 metric tons.
