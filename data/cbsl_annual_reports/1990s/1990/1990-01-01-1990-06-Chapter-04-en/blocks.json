The impressive growth m industrial output originated both from the continued expansion of private sector industries and better performance of the public sector industries.

The continued expansion of the wearing apparel industry both within and outside the investment promotion zones, was the major contributory factor for the increased level of output in the textile, wearing apparel and leather products category. However, the public sector production in this category recorded a considerable decline of 44 per cent mainly due to the reduced output of the National Textile Corporation on account of the privatization of Thulhiriya and Pugoda Mills. In the food, beverages and tobacco category, increased output levels were recorded mainly in the private sector industries engaged in the manufacture of tobacco, sugar, tea packeting, soft drinks and carbonated waters, liquor products, confectionary and vegetable oils and fats. However, the production of public sector industries in this category recorded a decline due to a substantial drop in the output of the Ceylon Oils and Fats and National Salt Corporations.",

The drop in the production of Ceylon Mineral Sands Corporation was primarily a result of a reduced output level of the Pulmuddai factory on account of civil disturbances in the region.
