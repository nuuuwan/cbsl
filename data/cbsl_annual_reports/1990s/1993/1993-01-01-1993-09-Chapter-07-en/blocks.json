Total export earnings increased by SDR 304 million (17 per cent)' in 1993 compared with SDR 295 million (20 per cent) in 1992, thus maintaining the export growth momentum achieved in 1992. Industrial exports continued to expand while agricultural exports recorded a recovery from the setback in 1992. The expenditure on imports also recorded a significant rise of SDR 385 million (15 per cent) in 1993. In 1992, the corresponding increase was SDR 250 million (11 per cent). Relatively higher increases were reported in the import of investment and durable consumer goods in 1993. Consequently, the trade deficit expanded by SDR 82 million (11 per cent) to SDR 822 million in 1993 from SDR 740 million in 1992.",

In 1993, 91 per cent of the tea estates were managed by the private sector and some companies succeeded in increasing the efficiency in terms of higher production with improvement in quality. Several procedural changes were carried out by the Sri Lanka Tea Board to encourage the participation in tea export trade. The requirement to obtain permits for exports was discontinued and producers were permitted to export tea in value added form directly without channeling through the auctioning system. Some of the previously imposed requirements for issuing licences for tea exporters were also relaxed. Conse\u00adquently, the number of registered tea exporters increased from 246 in 1992 to 331 in 1993. An interest subsidy scheme was launched to promote exports of value added teas to the CIS countries.",

However, this increase was not sufficient to maintain the share of minor agricultural products in total exports and it declined from 5 per cent to 4 per cent between the two years. Unmanufactured tobacco and cinnamon exports which accounted for 30 per cent and 28 per cent of the total earnings from minor agricultural products recorded increases of 2 per cent and 8 per cent in rupee terms respectively in 1993. Significant growth was also recorded in the earnings from betel leaves, pepper, vegetables, cashew nuts and essential oils. Except for pepper, the increases in export earnings were due to expansion in quantities exported and improved international prices. The higher export value of pepper was due to an increase in the quantity exported which more than offset the drop in average export price.",

The value of petroleum exports rose by 24 per cent, from SDR 45 million in 1992 to SDR 56 million in 1993 iargely due to increased volume of exports.

This was entirely due to increased earnings from gem exports which rose by 25 per cent, from SDR 40 million (Rs.2,482 million) to SDR 50 million (Rs. 3,402 million), largely on account of an expansion in the volume of exports. Market promotional activities abroad, particularly participation in the \"INHORGENTA\" Gem & Jewellery exhibition in Germany, helped to attract a considerable vol\u00adume of orders for Sri Lankan gems and this in turn contributed to the significant increase in the exports of gems in 1993.",

Consonant with the expansion in textile and garment industry, expenditure on imports of textile and clothing increased by SDR 76 million (Rs. 8,188 million) to SDR 619 million and it accounted for 37 per cent of the rise in imports of intermediate goods. The increased level of output in agriculture and industries led to comparable increases in imports of chemicals by SDR 11 million (Rs. 1,115 million), fertilizer by SDR 7 million (Rs. 742 million) and paper & paper products by SDR 8 million (Rs. 853 million). Reflecting the increases in both the import volume and price, the outlay on wheat grain imports rose by 12 per cent, from SDR 74 million (Rs. 4,549 million) in 1992 to SDR 83 million (Rs. 5,609 million) in 1993.

It covered a range of issues including Agriculture, Textile & Clothing, Trade in Services, Trade Related Investment Measures and Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. The overall impact of the agreement is expected to be beneficial to all developing countries including Sri Lanka as reduced tariff and non tariff measures together with strengthened trade rules and disciplines would result in an expansion in global trade. However, one of the major concerns of the agreement for Sri Lanka would be the phasing out of the Multi Fiber Agreement (MFA) and the integration of the textile & clothing sector into the GATT after a transitional period of ten years from 1995 to 2005. Though Sri Lanka's Textile & Garment industry is unlikely to be adversely affected during the transitional period, it will have to prepare itself formajor challenges arising from the removal of protection given by the quotas once the MFA is fully phased out.",

The Commission carried out monopoly investigations with respect to safety match industry and the production, distribution and sale of oxygen during the year. Investigations regarding the price increases in respect of soap, exercise books, bicycle tubes, aerated waters, oxygen and full cream milk powder were also conducted by the FTC. Moreover, investigations were conducted on the allegations of dumping with respect to imports of liquid glucose and steel. However, there was no evidence to substantiate the dumping of liquid glucose, but with regard to steel, it has been proposed to implement an appropriate tariff adjustment and impose standards on steel products.",

The tourist arrivals from Western Europe in 1993 reached 251,934 recording an increase of 2 per cent over 1992. This was mainly due to increased arrivals from Germany, U.K. and Sweden. Arrivals from the Asian market, the second largest, which was responsible for 30 per cent of total arrivals in 1992 recorded a drop in its share to 27 per cent in 1993. The number of arrivals from Asia dropped by 7 per cent in 1993 largely due to decreased arrivals from China (53 per cent), Hong Kong (51 per cent), South Korea (31 per cent), Japan (29 per cent) and Taiwan (21 per cent). Following the same trend, tourist arrivals from Australasia declined by 4 per cent in 1993.
