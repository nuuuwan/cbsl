    "text": "In 1993, there was a slight reversal of the moderating trend in the rate of increase in prices observed in 1992. The annual average of the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI) increased by 11.7 per cent in 1993 compared to a rise of 11.4 per cent in 1992. However, on a point to point basis, (December 1993 over December 1992), the Index registered a lower increase of 10.3 per cent compared with 13.8 per cent in 1992 pointing to a possible easing of inflation in the future. The Greater Colombo Consumer Price Index (GCPI), which is a more representative index than the CCPI with a wider geographic and item coverage, registered an increase of only 8.4 per cent in 1993. This was an appreciable drop from the rate of increase registered by the GCPI in the previous year (9.4 per cent). The divergence in the behaviour of the CCPI and GCPI is largely attributable to the differences in weights for major items in the two indices. The Wholesale Price Index registered an increase of 7.6 per cent in 1993 compared to 8.8 per cent in 1992 also indicating a slowing down of price increases at the primary market level.",

During the year, the price of rice grew modesdy while the price of dried chillies dropped by 8.0 per cent. However, the price of coconut rose sharply by as much as 16 per cent as a consequence of the drop in production during the year. The price of wheat flour was increased from Rs. 11.75 to Rs. 13.10 per Kg. in June 1993. It was further increased by 10 cents in October and by another 10 cents in November. The revision of wheat flour prices and the consequent increase in bread prices had a significant impact on the Index. Wheat flour and bread prices alone accounted for 6.0 per cent of the rise in the overall Index and 9.0 per cent of the increase in the Food Sub Index in 1993. Further, the revision in the prices of energy would have also had an indirect impact on food prices through the increase in transport costs and cost of production. The depreciation of the Rupee against the Dollar caused a rise in prices of imported items like sugar. These changes off-set the gains in price moderation achieved through improved domestic supply.",

Wage increases in this Sector more than compensated for inflation, and as a result, substantial improvements in real wages were experienced by the employ\u00adees in the government sector. Within the organised private sector a substantial wage increase was recorded for plantation workers and this was responsib'e for the high overall wage increase re\u00adcorded for this sector. In the unorganised sector, available information reveals that although the rise in wages was less than that recorded for the organised sector, real wages improved in most activities such as in tea, coconut and paddy cultivation and small scale building construction.",

Previously, special allow\u00adances granted had been payable only to categories of employees whose salary scales were below prescribed limits.",

Real wages improved by 4.1 per cent compared to 2.1 per cent in 1992. This increase in overall wages of workers in Wages Boards largely reflected the growth of wages for workers in agriculture (plantation workers have a weight of about 66 per cent in the overall index) who experienced a sharp increase in wages by 21.1 per cent compared to 14.9 per cent during 1992. Workers in Industry and Commerce experienced a wage growth of only 3.4 per cent in 1993. In 1992, wages of workers in this category moved up by 11.1 per cent. Given the rate of inflation in 1993 of 11.7 per cent, this represents a deterioration of real wages by 7.5 per cent. The nominal wages for workers in services have remained stagnant in 1993. As a consequence, the real wages for this category deteriorated by 10.6 per cent.",
