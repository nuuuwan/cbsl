In spite of a slight slippage in the revenue effort which caused the revenue/GDP ratio to drop from 20.2 per cent in 1992 to 19.8 per cent in 1993, the current account deficit declined marginally from 0.9 per cent of GDP to 0.5 per cent of GDP between the two years. This was brought about by a decrease in current expenditure in relation to GDP which declined from 22.5 per cent in 1991 to 21.1 per cent in 1992 and further to 20.3 per cent in 1993. In contrast to the experience in the previous year, government was able to maintain a high level of public investment which rose to 8.0 per cent of GDP in 1993 from 7.3 per cent in",

The high level of domestic borrowings by the government pre-empted resources otherwise available to the private sector exerting upward pressure on domestic interest rates. The overall developments in the fiscal front in 1993 thus underscored the need for greater fiscal consolidation towards generating a strong current account surplus conducive to maintaining a high level of public investment without resorting to high domestic borrowings.",

In spite of an additional revenue effort made through the enhanced defence levy, rationalisation of turnover taxes within a three rate band structure, increase in the uplift margin for import turnover tax and the imposition of special levies on selected enterprises, the overall revenue effort during 1993 weakened largely due to the removal of export taxes and the erosion in the tax base for import duties.",

Although salaries and wages rose by 25 per cent in 1993 due to the substantial wage increase extended to government employees, the overall expenditure on the purchase of goods and services at Rs.45,171 million registered only a moderate increase of 14 per cent reflecting continued restraint on other outlays. Underscoring this adjustment effort, expenditure on goods and services in relation to GDP was contained at 9.1 per cent in 1993 compared to 9.3 per cent in the previous year. In spite of a large expansion in pension outlays and social welfare expenditure on the Janasaviya and the Mid-Day Meal Programme, total transfer payments at Rs.26,853 million showed only a modest growth of 12",

Meanwhile, public investment (capital expenditure and on-lending to commercial public enter\u00adprises) funded through the government budget increased to Rs.39,569 million in 1993 from Rs.31,195 million in the previous year resulting in a rise in the public investment/GDP ratio from 7.3 per cent in 1992 to 8.0 per cent in 1993.

With the use of foreign grants amount\u00ading to Rs.8,025 million (1.6 per cent of GDP), the deficit (after grants) totalled Rs.32,084 million (6.5 per cent of GDP) in comparison to Rs.22,912 million (5.4 per cent of GDP) in the previous year. Meanwhile, reflecting higher public investment, the utilisation of net foreign loans for budget\u00adary purposes rose from Rs.7,36! million (1.7 per cent of GDP) in 1992 to Rs.9,855 million (2.0 per cent of GDP) in 1993. However, a large increase in capital expenditure in the context of a current account deficit resulted in a rise in domestic borrowings from Rs.'.5,552 million (3.7 per cent of GDP) in 1992 to Rs.22,229 million (4.5 per cent of GDP) in 1993. Nevertheless, due to aggressive open market operations by the Central Bank, domestic borrowings for budgetary operations were raised entirely from non-bank sources. Hence, the government was able to refrain from utilising resources from the banking system for financing the budget deficit. A summary of government fiscal operations during 1989-1993 is given in Table 1.55.",

As in the previous year, tax revenue accounted for 89 per cent of the total revenue collection in 1993. With the growing importance of the defence levy and turnover tax on domestic gpods and services, the share of tax revenue from domestic goods and services continued to increase from 50 per cent in 1992 to 55 per cent in 1993. The enhanced collection on account of these taxes was largely attributable to further rationalisation of the turno\u00adver tax structure, increase in the uplift margin for import turnover tax and the full year impact of the high defence levy. In contrast, the share of international trade oriented taxes witnessed a drop of 4 percentage points to 24 per cent in 1993 reflecting the abolition of export taxes at the end of 1992 and the erosion in the tax base for import duty owing to the grant of duty waivers and exemptions on a wide range of commodities. Meanwhile, the share of income taxes further rose to 16 per cent in 1993 from 14 per cent in 1992 due partly to the expansion of the tax base for income taxes resulting from the imposition of the PAYE tax on corporate employees. The increase in the share of income taxes was also partly due to enhanced collections from the withholding tax imposed on interest payments on bonds issued for the restructuring of the two state banks. Meanwhile, the share of revenue on account of the non-refundable tax on Central Bank holdings of Treasury bills dropped from 3 per cent in 1992 to 1 per cent in 1993 reflecting the depleted Treasury bill stock in the Central Bank's portfolio, consequent to aggressive open market operations.",

Revenue from profits and dividends at Rs.2,135 million rose by Rs. 1976 million due largely to the imposition of special levies of Rs.771 million on Sri Lanka Telecom and Rs.300 million on the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) under the Finance Act. The share of interest income in non-tax revenue de\u00adclined from 38 per cent in 1992 to 31 per cent in 1993.

The enhanced importance of this source of taxation is attributed to the re-classification of commodities for turnover tax within a three band rate structure, increase in the tax base for turnover tax on imports with the imposition of a higher uplift margin, the full year impact of a 3 per cent defence levy and a recovery of the food, beverages and tobacco sub-sector which generate the bulk of indirect taxes.",

The revenue collection on account of turnover tax on manufactur\u00ading activities totalled Rs.9,048 million recording a higher growth of 10 per cent compared to a 4 per cent rise witnessed during the previous year. This is largely attributed to the recovery of the food, beverages and tobacco manufacturing activities from the drought conditions that prevailed in the country during 1992. Moreover, under the impact of the increase in the uplift margin from 10 per cent to 25 per cent in February, 1993, revenue from import turnover tax at Rs. 15,607 million registered a growth of 27 per cent -10 percentage points higher than in the previous year. Thus, the share of import turnover tax in overall turnover tax collection increased from 51 per cent in 1992 to 53 per cent in 1993. With the increase in the rate of turnover tax on telecommunication services from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in February, 1993, the higher turnover tax of 10 per cent imposed on travel agents, hotels, auctioneers, etc. from September, 1993 onwards and the removal of the turnover tax exemption on the National Development Bank (NDB) and the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) in November 1993, non-manufacturing turnover tax rose from Rs.3,546 million in 1992 to Rs.4,727 million in 1993. Meanwhile, with a view to facilitating the transition to the Value Added Tax (VAT), turnover tax was rationalised within a three band rate structure of 5,10 and 20 per cent in place of the prevailing four band rate structure of 5,10,15 and 20 per cent.",

    "text": "Revenue from excise taxes generated Rs. 12,410 million in 1993 registering an impressive growth of 21 percent in contrast to a decline of 3 percent during the previous year. This was largely brought about by an enhanced revenue collection on account of processed tobacco and cigarettes. In spite of a modest growth in the volume of sales resulting from a recovery in the production of processed tobacco, revenue from this source at Rs.7,428 million marked an increase of 33 percent in 1993 largely reflecting the full year impact of the excise duty revision of Rs.0.52 per cigarette effected in October, 1992. Meanwhile, the collection on account of liquor taxes at Rs.4,125 million in 1993 indicated a growth of 20 percent over the previous year due to an increased consumption of liquor during the year and the upward revision in duty by Rs.8 per bottle of arrack in October, 1993. Despite efforts to broad-base excise taxes with the introduction of excise duty on items such as petrol (Rs.2 per litre) in October 1993, diesel vans with a seating capacity of 10 -15 persons (15 per cent) and video games (25 percent) in November, 1993, revenue under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act declined from Rs.l,225 million in 1992 to Rs.857 million in 1993 partly owing to duty reductions in items such as aerated water from Rs. 1 to Rs.0.50 per bottle in February, 1993 and thereafter to Rs.0.25 per bottle in November, 1993.",

The lacklustre performance in import duty collection was largely attributed to the grant of ad-hoc duty waivers on various products and duty free concessions extended to enterprises coming under the Board of Investment (BOI) status during the year. Thus, the total value of dutiable imports declined from Rs.75,788 million in 1992 to Rs.73,737 million in 1993 although the total value of imports rose from Rs.153,555 million to Rs.193,550 million between the two years.",

Thus, changes in the import structure also contributed to the stagnation in import duty revenue in 1993. Meanwhile, taking a further step towards rationalisation of the tariff structure, duties on textiles which were carrying high specific duties were converted to an ad-valorem rate of 100 per cent in April, 1993 which was further reduced to 50 per cent in November, 1993. Moreover, duties on motor vehicles were reduced to a range of 50 to 100 per cent. Meanwhile, a reduction in the maximum nominal tariff of 50 per cent in the four band rate structure (10,20, 35 and 50) to 45 per cent in November, 1993 also contributed towards the stagnation in the import duty collection in 1993. These reforms in customs tariffs together with the abolition of export taxes showed continued progress in the on-going tax reforms to reduce reliance on international trade for government revenue purposes.",

    "text": "Relaxing the wage restraint followed in recent years, the government announced a 30 per cent wage increase subject to a minimum of Rs.500 per month in the 1993 Budget. However, with a view to minimising the budgetary burden, this increase was implemented on a staggered basis over a two year period commencing January, 1993. Accordingly, employees in non-executive categories were granted 60 per cent of the increase effective from January, 1993 while the balance was given from July, 1993. As regards executive categories, 50 per cent of the wage increase was granted effective from January, 1993 while the balance was differed for January, 1994. The staggered increase in salaries of government employees helped the government to contain expenditure on account of salaries and wages at Rs.25,971 million which was an increase of Rs.5,178 million or 25 per cent over the previous year. Consequently, expenditure on salaries in relation to GDP rose from 4.9 per cent in 1992 to 5.2 per cent in 1993.",

Accordingly, these expenditures in relation to GDP declined to 3.9 per cent from 4.4 per cent in the previous year. The strong adjustment effort towards minimising outlays on goods and services thus enabled the government to reduce the overall expenditure on goods and services to 9.1 per cent of GDP from 9.3 per cent of GDP in 1992 in spite of the increased burden on account of salaries and wages in 1993.",

Interest expenditure on domestic debt increased from Rs.21,201 million in 1992 to Rs.23,743 million in 1993 reflecting a moderate growth of 12 per cent compared with 18 per cent in 1992. Although the utilisation of government securities rose by Rs.8,200 million in 1993, compared to Rs.2,979 million in 1992 and the interest rates for government securities during 1993 increased from a range of 15 per cent - 17 per cent per annum in 1992 to a range of 16 per cent - 18.5 per cent per annum in 1993, interest expenditure on account of medium and long term debt marked a moderate growth of 16 per cent as the majority of Rupee securities was floated during the second half of the year. The interest burden on these loans is expected to fall in 1994 as interest payments on Rupee securities are made bi-annually. Meanwhile, although the outstanding liability on account of Treasury bills increased by a lower amount of Rs.10,100 million in 1993 compared with Rs.14,128 million in the previous year, interest payments on short term debt at Rs.12,971 million marked an increase of 9 per cent in 1993 owing to the generally high yields on Treasury bills which rose from a range of 18.88 - 18.99 per cent per annum in 1992 to 19.35 - 19.38 per cent per annum in 1993. Interest expenditure on foreign debt at Rs.5,183 million witnessed an increase of 9 per cent in 1993 in comparison to a 15 per cent rise during the previous year. The average interest rate on foreign debt declined to 1.9 per cent in 1993 from 2.0 per cent in 1992 reflecting a further improvement in the concessionary element in foreign debt of the government.",

However, transfer payments as a percentage of GDP declined from 5.6 per cent to 5.4 per cent between the two years. Pension payments at Rs.10,460 million accounting for nearly 40 per cent of total transfer payments registered a sharp increase of 29 per cent in 1993 reflecting the rise in the monthly pension allowance of Rs.300 from January, 1993, the grant of Rs.260 per month on account of the cost of living allowance to pensioners in June, 1993 and the continuous rise in the total number of pensioners which stood at 305,000 at the end of 1993. Meanwhile, outlays on account of welfare programmes comprising food and kerosene stamps, mid-day meal, uniforms and the Janasaviya at Rs.8,376 million showed only a rise of 5 per cent due largely to a moderation in expenditure on food and kerosene stamps. Thus, expenditure on these welfare programmes declined from 1.7 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 1.6 per cent in 1993. Expenditure on other household transfers inclusive of expenditure on refugees in the North and East amounted to Rs.2,367 million.",

However, lagging behind the growth in nominal GDP, such expenditure in relation to GDP declined from 7.7 per cent in 1992 to 7.5 per cent in 1993. While expenditure on education showed a moderate growth of 6 per cent, current expenditure on health reflected a sharp increase of 26 per cent. Welfare expenditure, providing a wide range of services particularly to the lower segment of the population and transfers to pension\u00aders, totalling Rs.20,148 million marked an increase of 16 per cent in 1993 largely due to the expansion in pension payments. Current outlays on public administration and defence at Rs.27,564 million accounted for 5.5 per cent of GDP in 1993 compared to 5.7 per cent in 1992 reflecting a restraint on miscellaneous expenditure on account of civil administration. Meanwhile, defence expenditure at Rs.20,159 million showed a 16 per cent growth maintaining a GDP ratio of 4 per cent in 1993 in comparison to 4.1 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile, current expenditure on economic services channelled for the maintenance of economic services such as agriculture and irrigation, fisheries, transport and communication and trade and commerce showed a moderate growth of 7 per cent. A functional classification of government expenditure is presented in Table 1.58.",

In mobilising resources from domestic sources, the government used both short term and medium term debt instruments during the year. A gross borrowing of Rs.28,205 million was raised through the floatation of Rupee loans. However, with a total repayment of Rs.20,004 million, net borrowings through Rupee loans amounted to Rs.8,200 million, Rs.5,221 million higher than that in the previ\u00adous year. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) continued to be the largest single subscriber to the Rupee Loan Programme contributing Rs.21,358 million and accounting for three-fourths of the amount raised through Rupee securities in 1993. Meanwhile, a further sum of Rs.9,807 million was raised through the issue of Treasury bills in 1993. This included the issue of Treasury bills amount\u00ading to Rs.3,753 million of two year maturity. Although borrowings through Treasury bills amounted to Rs.9,807 million, the ownership of Treasury bills changed drastically in 1993 due to aggressive open market operations of the Central Bank which resulted in a reduction in Bank's holdings of Treasury bills by Rs. 17,848 million. However, with increased holdings of Treasury bills by commercial banks, the net decline in Treasury bills in the banking system remained at Rs. 14,227 million. This reduction together with additional issues of Treasury bills raised the non-bank holdings of Treasury bills by Rs.20,102 million. Accordingly, net borrowings from non-bank sources rose from Rs.21,079 million in 1992 to Rs.28,308 million in 1993. In financing the budget deficit, claims arising from Central Bank's provisional advances amounted to Rs.l,574 million, while cash items in the process collection totalled Rs.l,747 million. The government also used a sum of Rs.863 million by running down its deposit balances with the Central Bank. Never\u00adtheless, with the reduction in Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank net credit to government from the Central Bank declined by Rs.13,664 million.",

The debt held by the Central Bank dropped sharply by 53 per cent to Rs.l6,480 million in 1993 reflecting aggressive open market operations during the year which resulted in a large reduction in the Bank's holdings of Treasury bills, from Rs.25,998 million in 1992 to Rs.5,978 million in 1993. Meanwhile, the debt held by commercial banks rose from Rs.23,179 million in 1992 to Rs.73,654 million in 1993 registering an increase of 218 per cent between the two years. This was partly due to the issue of Rs.24,088 million of restructuring bonds to the two state banks and partly to enhanced investments in Treasury bills by commercial banks in response to high yields on such investments.",

The rise in foreign debt was due to a net borrowing of Rs.9,855 million as well as an increased liability of Rs.24,490 million arising from exchange rate variations. The debt on account of project loans which consti\u00adtuted nearly 80 per cent of foreign liabilities rose by Rs.30,061 million to Rs.215,064 million - the combined outcome of a net borrowing of Rs. 12,511 million and an additional liability of Rs. 17,550 million on account of exchange rate variations. The outstanding liability on account of non-project loans in the form of commodity, cash and other loans increased from Rs.50,536 million in 1992 to Rs.54,819 million in 1993. As in the previous year, concessional loans at Rs.260,331 million accounted for 96 per cent of foreign debt in 1993. The outstanding bilateral loans amounting to Rs.151,007 million, showed an increase of 13 per cent while multilateral debt at Rs.109,325 million marked an increase of 20 per cent in 1993.
