ACCOUNTS AND OPERATIONS OF THE

CENTRAL BANK

ACCOUNTS AND BANKING OPERATIONS

Total assets/liabilities of the Central Bank as at the end of 1993, stood at Rs. 133,634 million registering an increase of 32 per cent over the previous year. The increase in assets/liabilities of the Bank in 1992 over 1991 was around 5.7 per cent. The Balance Sheet of the Central Bank as at December 31,1993, and the Profit and Loss Account of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 1993 are presented in Table 2.1.

The increase in assets was not reflected uniformly in all categories. The International Reserve of the Bank rose by 91.4 per cent, from Rs.39,663 million to Rs.75,896 million. International Reserve has now become the largest asset category, accounting for 56.8 per cent of total assets compared to 39.2 per cent at the end of 1992. Other assets increased by 87 per cent, from Rs.14,687 million to Rs.27,465 million. Domestic assets of the Bank, however, recorded a decline of 35.4 per cent, from Rs.46,904 million to Rs.30,273 million.

Within the category of Domestic Assets, the largest decrease of 81.9 per cent was in the sub-category of Government and Government guaranteed securities, while medium and long term credit facilities to commercial banks and other credit institutions and short term advances to commercial banks and Regional Rural Development Banks decreased by 14.2 per cent and 18.5 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, loans and advances to the Government and contributions to financial institutions recorded increases of 10.9 per cent and 4.1 per cent, respectively.

On the liabilities side, currency in circulation increased by 17.8 per cent, from Rs.30,496 million to Rs.35,949 million. Total deposits with the Central Bank registered an increase of 43.9 per cent, from Rs.35,765 million to Rs.51,462 million during the year under review. Deposits constituted the largest category of liabilities and accounted for 38.5 per cent of total liabilities. Within the category of Deposits, the deposits of international organisations, foreign governments and foreign banking institutions increased by 58.7 per cent. Deposits of commercial banks and of Government agencies and institutions rose by 42.9 per cent and 46.2 per cent, respectively. Mean­while, deposits of the Government declined by 32.2 per cent. A comparison of the major compo­nents of assets and liabilities of the Bank is shown in Table 2.2.

The income of the Bank for the year 1993, at Rs.12,098 million, showed an increase of 0.2 per cent over the preceding year. This low level of growth in the income of the Bank against a much higher growth (32 per cent) in total assets was mainly due to the shift in the asset portfolio from high interest earning domestic assets to low interest earning foreign assets and other non-interest bearing assets such as counter guarantees issued by the Government against guarantees issued by the Bank on behalf of the Government and Provisional Advances provided to the Government in terms of Section 89 of the Monetary Law Act.

After making allowances for expenditure and allocations to reserve accounts and provisions for depreciation and other charges, the balance net profit of the Bank, amounting to Rs. 1,000 million, was earmarked to be paid to the Consolidated Fund of the Government in terms of Section 39(c) of the Monetary Law Act.

The total value of foreign currency purchases by the Central Bank from commercial banks in Sri Lanka amounted to Rs.31,332.4 million, while foreign currency sales to commercial banks amounted to Rs.914.6 million in 1993, compared to Rs.20,326.9 millioh and Rs.3,425.1 million, respectively in 1992.

Open Market Operations

(a) Repurchase Market for Treasury Bills

The Central Bank introduced a Repurchase Scheme in Treasury bills with effect from 04th October, 1994. The objective of the scheme was to further develop the Secondary Market for Treasury bills by providing an investment avenue for financial institutions with short term excess liquidity, while eliminating erratic fluctuations in the inter-bank call money rates. Under this scheme, the Central Bank commits itself to buy back on an agreed date, the Treasury bills sold from its holdings. Commercial banks and other institutions which have access to the Secondary Treasury Bill Market of the Bank are eligible to participate in the Scheme. The maturity period of repurchase agreements varied from one day (overnight) to a maximum period of 3 months.

The total sales turnover under repurchase agreements during the three months in which it was in operation in 1993 was Rs.38,883 million. The sales turnover to the commercial bank sector was Rs.35,482 million and to the non-bank sector was Rs.3,401 million. The yield rates applicable on overnight investments under repurchase agreements during the said period varied between 16.50 per cent and 19.83 per cent per annum.

(b) Secondary Treasury Bill Market

The sales turnover of Treasury bills in the Secondary Market decreased from Rs. 120,798 million in 1992 to Rs.95,377 million in 1993. The purchase turnover also decreased from Rs.50,907 million to Rs.47,382 million during the same period. The decline in sales turnover was mainly attributed to the shifting of investments by commercial banks and other institutions from Secondary Market Treasury bills to overnight repurchase agreements. The net sales turnover to the non-banking sector increased from Rs.20,718 million in 1992 to Rs.22,934 million in 1993.

The yield rates applicable on investments in 3 months Treasury bills in the Secondary Market varied between 17.71 per cent and 20.66 per cent per annum during the year, while the yield rates on six months and one year Treasury bills varied from 18.22 per cent to 20.70 per cent and from 19.13 per cent to 21.71 per cent per annum, respecti vely.

Subsidy and Ex-gratia Payment to Indian Repatriates

The Bank continued to operate the payment schemes relating to the repatriation of estate workers of Indian origin covered under the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of 1964, on behalf of the Government. Total subsidy payments under this scheme amounted to Rs.276,609.24 in 1993 com­pared to Rs. 182,598.24 in 1992. Ex-aratia payments amounted to Rs.38,775 in 1993 compared to Rs.33,300in 1992.

Import Duty Rebate to Exporters

The Bank continued to reimburse claims made by commercial banks in respect of import duty rebates paid to exporters on behalf of the Government. A total sum of Rs.784.6 million was reimbursed during 1993 compared with Rs.638.4 million in 1992.

Compulsory Savings Fund

The Central Bank continued to be the custodian of the monies collected under the Compulsory Savings Act No.6 of 1971 and the ceiling on Income & Compulsory Savings Law No.15 of 1972 and continued to administer the Compulsory Savings Fund on behalf of the Government. During the year, the Bank paid out Rs.54,529 (inclusive of interest) on applications made by 23 contribu­tors.

(VIII)

Government Accounts

As Banker to the Government, the Central Bank continued to maintain accounts of Govern­ment Departments, Government Agencies and Institutions and certain Statutory Boards. The number of operational accounts at the end of December, 1993 was 184 compared to 182 in 1992.

Foreign Finance

During the year under review, the Bank continued to receive disbursements made available under various foreign loans and grants while repayments of foreign loans were also effected on behalf of the Government.

CURRENCY ISSUE

The Bank, as the sole currency issuing authority, continued to perform the function of issuing legal tender currency in Sri Lanka for use in domestic transactions during the year 1993. The volume of currency in circulation as at the end of 1993 stood at Rs.35,949.3 million. Notes in circulation comprised 96 per cent of the total currency in circulation.

On 4th June 1993, the Bank issued a commemorative silver coin in the denomination of Rs.500/- to mark the Anubudu Mihindu Jayanthiya - the 2300th anniversary of the arrival of Arahath Mahinda in Sri Lanka. This was the second occasion that the Bank issued a commemora­tive coin to mark a religious event, the first being the issue of the 2500th Buddha Jayanthiya commemorative coin in 1957. The inaugural presentation of the Anubudu Mihindu Jayanthiya coin to His Excellency the President took place at a special ceremony held at Mihintale. Arrangements were also made to issue the coin to the general public at a special counter set-up at Mihintale.

The mobile currency exhibition of the Bank, which was launched in 1992, continued its functions during 1993. Specimen currency notes of almost all countries of the world, as well as counterfeit notes and defectively printed Sri Lanka notes are displayed in the mobile exhibition. During. 1993, 20 such exhibitions were held in various parts of the country. In August 1993, the Bank participated in a Numismatic Workshop and Coins Exhibition organised by the Colombo National Museum.

The currency processing system was automated in 1992, and for this purpose, two Currency Verification, Counting & Sorting Systems (CVCS Systems) were installed in the Currency Depart­ment. The automated system continued to operate during 1993. However, the Systems have to be re-tuned to process the new design Sri Lanka Heritage Series currency notes and steps are being taken to accomplish the retuning process.

BANKING DEVELOPMENT

Branch Expansion

During 1993, the banking network of the country expanded at a slower pace than in the previous year as shown in Table 2.5. With the opening of a Regional Rural Development Bank (RRDB) in the administrative district of Gampaha, the total number of banking institutions, includ­ing development banks and savings banks, increased from 43 in 1992 to 44 in 1993. As at the end of 1993, the banking system comprised 23 commercial banks (6 domestic commercial banks and 17 foreign commercial banks), 17 RRDBs, 3 development banks and a savings bank.

( I X )

The branch network of commercial banks and the RRDBs showed a slow growth during 1993. The total number of branches in operation increased by 4.4 per cent to 1,017 whereas in 1992, the number of branches rose by 9.2 per cent. The expansion of the branch network of the State banks was slow during the year 1993 mainly as a result of the policy of consolidating the existing branches. The number of branches of other commercial banks (local private banks and foreign banksf and the RRDBs too, increased slowly during 1993.

Bank of Ceylon opened only one new branch in 1993, named the "Second Corporate Branch", for the purpose of monitoring and supervising certain categories of loans. The Agrarian Service Centre (ASC) branches at Helboda, Diyatalawa, Mihintale, Naula and Pasgoda were upgraded to 'C grade status and in addition to the re-opening of its Muttur branch, Bank of Ceylon also opened an extension office at the Ceylon Shipping Lines warehouse. As a result of these changes, by the end of the year, the number of main branches of Bank of Ceylon stood at 259,while the ASC branches, kachcheri branches, extension offices and pay offices numbered 29, 24,18 and 3, respec­tively. The number of overseas branches of Bank of Ceylon remained unchanged at 2.

People's Bank opened 3 new branches at Dehiattakandiya, Ganemulla and Yakkala in addition to re-opening its Serunuwara and Mullaitivu branches. Further, People's Bank opened an extension office at the premises of the Open University of Sri Lanka. With these additions, the number of branches of People's Bank increased to 320 while the number of extension/pay offices and pawning centres of People's Bank increased to 7.

Hatton National Bank Ltd. expanded its branch network to 51 by opening 4 branches at Grandpass, Dambulla, Gampaha and Horana. The extension and pay offices of Hatton National Bank rose to 2 with the opening of a pay office at the Koggala Free Trade Zone. Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd. expanded its branch network to 31 by opening 3 branches at Kandana, Maradana and Akuressa. Sampath Bank Ltd. established 2 branches at Gampaha and Dehiwela, thus increasing its total number of branches, excluding payoffices and extension offices to 15 by the end of 1993. Seylan Bank Ltd. during the year under review, established 11 branches at Nawala, Bandarawela, Kuliyapitiya, Mawanella, Old Moors Street, Hingurakgoda, Embilipitiya, Puttalam, Maradana, Katuneriya and Koggala and upgraded its mobile banking centres located at Alubomulla (and shifted it to Bandaragama) and Manampitiya, to the status of fully fledged branches. Accordingly, the number of branches of Seylan Bank Ltd. totalled 57 by the end of 1993.

ANZ Grindlays Bank opened three branches at Moratuwa, Rajagiriya and Kollupitiya, increasing its total number of branches to 7. Meanwhile, ABN-AMRO Bank opened one branch in Colombo 7. Consequent to the opening of branches by ANZ Grindlays Bank and ABN-AMRO Bank, the number of foreign bank branches as at end 1993 totalled 33, an increase of 4 over the previous year.

The Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) expanded their branch network further. The newly opened RRDB Gampaha opened 2 branches at Gampaha and Mawaramandiya, while the RRDB Ampara expanded its branch network from 5 to 7 by opening 2 branches at Kalmunai and Mahaoya. The RRDB Polonnaruwa established one branch at Galamuna while the RRDB Ratnapura opened one branch at Kalawana. The RRDB Kegalle increased the number of its branches to 13 by establishing a branch at Nelumdeniya. With these changes, the total number of branches of the RRDB network increased from 156 in 1992 to 163 in 1993.

The National Savings Bank opened a branch at Wattala, increasing its total number of branches from 84 to 85. The office network of the National Development Bank and the Develop­ment Finance Corporation of Ceylon remained unchanged during the year. The State Mortgage & Investment Bank closed its Matara branch, thereby reducing the number of its branches from 3 to 2.

( X )

Mobile Banking Centres

With a view to catering to the banking needs of people in areas without banking facilities or with poor facilities, the RRDBs and a few commercial banks, including the two State banks, continued to provide mobile banking services. Seylan Bank commenced mobile banking services at Raddoluwa, Ganemulla and Kotiyakumbura and the Anuradhapura RRDB commenced mobile banking services at Negampaha and Siyambalangamuwa during 1993.

Installation of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)

BANK SUPERVISION

The Bank Supervision Department is responsible for the continuous supervision and periodic examination of all banking institutions in the country. The basic objective underlying the role of supervision is to ensure public confidence in the banking system and safeguard the interests of the depositors.

The Department carries out these responsibilities through on-site examinations and off-site surveillance. With regard to on-site examinations, the Department commenced the examinations of 15 commercial banks, one Regional Rural Development Bank (RRDB) and one Development Banking Institution (DBI) during 1993. Of these, examinations of the RRDB, DBI and 9 commer­cial banks, were completed in the year under reviewed. The examination of three commercial banks which had commenced in 1992 were also concluded during 1993. On the basis of the observations made at on-site examinations, it was ensured that corrective action where necessary was taken by the Managements of the relevant banks.

In regard to the off-site surveillance of commercial banks, the Department continued to monitor the financial condition of commercial banks and RRDBs on the basis of the monthly Statements of Assets and Liabilities forwarded to the Department. Monitoring the operations of the FCBUs established under the Foreign Currency Banking Scheme too was carried out on a monthly basis, with emphasis in this regard being on the lending operations of resident exporters. Informa­tion on irregular and large advances was also obtained on a quarterly basis to examine the continuous development of commercial banks regularly. The profitability and financial strength of each commercial bank as well as the industry as a whole, were computed and evaluated on the basis . of annual statements on income and expenditure furnished by the banks.

The Department continued to exercise its responsibility in ensuring strict compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Banking Act and other guidelines issued by the Department on prudential requirements. These included the maintenance of a minimum level of liquid assets and capital, the adherence to the single borrower limits, restrictions on accommodation to directors and their interests, submission of annual financial statements in the prescribed accounting formats within the statutory period, setting up interest in suspense accounts on non-performing advances and making adequate provisions for bad debts. The daily monitoring of foreign working balances of commercial banks was continued to ensure that banks do not exceed the limits imposed by the Central Bank. The Department prepared the initial plans to computerise and adopt modern analyti­cal techniques to become more up to date in these operations.

During the year under review, the implementation of the new capital adequacy measures based on requirements laid down by the Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices Committee (the BASLE Committee) was a major task undertaken by the Department. In terms of Section 102 of the Monetary Law Act, the Monetary Board prescribed these requirements for commercial banks as set out in the Government Gazette Extraordinary No.786/15 of 1st October, 1993. In terms of these requirements, commercial banks were required to satisfy a core capital adequacy ratio of 4 per cent as at 31st December, 1993 and an overall ratio of 8 per cent as at 31st March, 1994. Under the new standard, the adequacy of capital is measured against the risky assets. This is a departure from the earlier practice of measuring capital adequacy against a bank's total liabilities. Commercial banks are required to submit a quarterly return on their capital adequacy in a specified format prescribed by the Department. Regular monitoring will be carried out by the Department on the basis of these returns.

(XII)

In the year under review, the Department administered the Deposit Insurance Scheme which has been in operation since 1987. The number of institutions registered under the Scheme remained at 11 during the year, while the premium payable continued to be 3.75 cents per quarter, for every Rs.100/- as in the previous year.

The Department was also actively involved in formulating several amendments to the Banking Act which were necessitated by reforms in Sri Lanka's financial sector, which have either already taken place and or which have been proposed. The amendments proposed in this regard, it is hoped, would have the effect of levelling the playing field for all licensed commercial banks in Sri Lanka. They would broaden the scope of supervision by bringing hitherto unregulated financial operations such as off-shore operations of commercial banks, within the supervisory ambit of the Central Bank and strengthen the regulatory powers of the Central Bank. The^ptpposed amendments would also make prudential regulations currently in force applicable to Development Finance Institutions and savings banks whose operations have not been subject to such regulations in the Banking Act.

NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

As in previous years, in 1993 too, the Central Bank continued to monitor and supervise the finance companies which are registered with it. During the year, the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions placed greater emphasis on on-site examination of finance compa­nies, while continuing with the off-site surveillance through the Early Warning System (EWS). In order to strengthen the off-site surveillance further, the Department decided to call for Profit and Loss Accounts and Balance Sheets on monthly basis.

The consolidated balance sheet of finance companies which have been permitted to accept public deposits indicates a 16 per cent growth in deposit liabilities during the financial year ending 31.03.1993. The borrowings of these companies declined by 37.5 per cent, while their net capital funds increased by 15 per cent. The provision for bad and doubtful debts more than doubled during the financial year. On the asset side the total liquid assets increased by 20 per cent during the financial year, while the advances, which amounted to 58 per cent of the total assets as at 31.03.1992, increased to 64 per cent as at 31.03.1993, indicating a growth rate of about 22 per cent. More details are given in Table 2.6.

Under the provisions of the Finance Companies Act No.78 of 1988, 28 finance companies have been granted registration by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank. The registrations granted to two companies were withdrawn during the year. The registration of Shabra Unico Finance Ltd. was withdrawn on 27.08.1993, while the registration of Citicredit Ltd. was withdrawn on 29.11.1993. The registrations of these two companies were withdrawn for continuous violation of the Directions issued by the Monetary Board. No new companies were granted registration during the year.

The relief scheme to depositors of failed finance companies which became operational in 1989, continued to be implemented during the year. The relief payments made to depositors of 7 distressed finance companies during the year amounted to Rs.48;0 million. The total value of relief payments made to depositors upto the end of 1993 was Rs.509.9 million. These relief payments were financed largely through loans granted by the Central Bank. One registered finance company, the administration and management of which was taken over by the Monetary Board in February 1992, was granted loans amounting to Rs.213.1 million during the year to meet its deposit liabili­ties. As at end December, 1993, the total outstanding Central Bank loans which have been granted to this Company amounted to Rs.1,141 million.

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE

During 1993, the Development Finance Department continued the operation of the Credit Guarantee Schemes for Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMI), the Bus Purchase Loan (BPL), and the Entrepreneur Development Programme in addition to the Refinance Scheme for Low Income Housing under the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Low Income Shelter Programme (HGLISP) Phase IV. The suspension of refinance under the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund (MLCF) which came into effect in December 1991, continued into 1993 as well. Therefore, the administration of the MLCF was limited only to following up on the performance of projects (excluding refinance provided to Finance Companies) which had been refinanced prior to the suspension of the MLCF facility.

Credit Guarantee Operations

A summary of credit guarantee operations under the six credit guarantee schemes administered by the Central Bank as at 31st December 1993 i.e., the Small Scale Industries (SSI) Scheme, SMI I, n, III and IV Schemes and BPL Scheme is given in Tables 2.7 and 2.8 respectively. Table 2.9 gives an industry-wise classification of projects financed under the SMI-II, III and IV Schemes.

Small Scale Industries (SSI) Scheme

The SSI Scheme which came into effect in 1978 was superseded by the SMI-I Scheme in 1979. The issue of credit guarantees under the SSI Scheme was completed in 1981. Out of a total of 767 loans guaranteed under this scheme, only 10 loans amounting to Rs.0.58 million and involving a total guarantee commitment to the Central Bank of Rs.0.44 million were still in operation as at the end of 1993. Claims under this scheme will be met by the Treasury which has already paid Rs.l .7 million. In the event that claims in respect of all 10 loans outstanding are submitted, this will involve a further payment of Rs.0.5 million by the Treasury.

Small and Medium Scale Industries - I (SMI - I) Scheme

The SMI-I Scheme came into operation in 1979. Under this scheme 1,670 guarantees covering loans amounting to Rs.286 million were issued during 1979 - 1982. A total of 1,223 loans were fully repaid upto 1993. At the end of 1993, 113 guarantees amounting to Rs.31 million had been either withdrawn or had lapsed due to non compliance by the Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) with the Central Bank's operating instructions. The total liability in respect of 337 claims received was Rs.33.5 million, of which 229 claims amounting to Rs.l8.9 million were settled. In terms of a decision taken, 50 per cent of the liability on 27 loans granted for projects located in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the country, which were declared either in default or as failures,

were paid as interim settlements amounting to Rs.2.1 million. Loans relating to 37 claims amount­ing to Rs.2.0 million were repaid by the borrowers after submission of claims while 29 claims with a total value of Rs.5.1 million were rejected on account of non compliance by the PCIs with operat­ing instructions. Consideration of 11 claims amounting to Rs.2.6 million was deferred on account of either rehabilitation programmes undertaken by the PCIs or re-commencement of repayment of the loan by the borrowers after the submission of such claims. At the end of December 1993, only 49 loans amounting to Rs.5.96 million with a maximum guarantee liability of Rs.3.6 million were reported to be operational. Premia collected under this scheme and post claim recoveries by the Central Bank amounted to Rs.12.2 million and Rs.6.9 million respectively. Available resources, made up of premia inflows and post claim recoveries amounting to Rs.19.1 million, were not sufficient to meet liabilities under the scheme and a sum of Rs.2 million had to be met by the Central Bank. The estimated liability in respect of 49 guarantees on loans outstanding amounting to Rs.5.9 million is Rs.3.6 million.

Small and Medium Scale Industries - II (SMI - II) Scheme

The SMI - II Scheme came into effect in 1982 and guarantees under this scheme were issued upto 1989. During the period 1982 - 1989, 2,531 guarantees were issued on loans amounting to Rs.1,393 million involving a maximum guarantee liability of Rs.714 million. Of these, 1,368 loans amounting to Rs.576 million were fully repaid, while 340 guarantees to the value of Rs.167 million were either withdrawn or had lapsed due to non-compliance by the PCIs with the Central Bank's operating instructions. A total of 216 claims with a liability of Rs.56 million was received as at the end of 1993, of which 117 claims amounting to Rs.29 million were settled. Interim payments not exceeding 50 per cent of the liability of the Central Bank, amounting to Rs.0.67 million, were made in respect of 4 claims from the Northern and Eastern Provinces in terms of a decision taken in that regard, while 40 claims amounting to Rs.9 million were rejected on account of non-compliance by the PCIs with operating instructions. Loans relating to 5 claims were repaid by the borrowers after submission of claims to the Central Bank while PCIs have withdrawn 7 claims amounting to Rs.3.6 million. At the end of 1993, consideration of 24 claims amounting to Rs.7.5 million had been deferred on account of either rehabilitation programmes undertaken by the PCIs or recommence­ment of repayment of the loans by the borrowers after the submission of such claims. At the end of 1993, 662 loans amounting to Rs.204 million, and with a total Central Bank guarantee liability of Rs.117 million, were operational. Of these, 427 loans with a liability of Rs.55.7 million were reported to be in arrears.

Premia collected under this scheme amounted to Rs.28.4 million as at the end of 1993 while postclaim recoveries by the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 11.9 million, making a total of Rs.40.3 million.

Of these, 50 claims totalling Rs.15.4 million, were settled while 16 claims totalling Rs.5.5 million were rejected. Consideration of 5 claims was deferred due to regularisation of the respective loan accounts by the borrowers after the submission of such claims. By the end of December 1993, 2,307 loans amounting to Rs.873 million with a maximum guarantee liability of Rs.577 million were operational.

(xvm)

SMI - II, SMI - III and SMI - IV Credit Guarantee Schemes - Industry-wise Classification as at December 31, 1993

1,911 new buses were introduced to the public bus transport fleet by 1,816 borrowers, indicating the high proportion of single bus owners who made use of this scheme. Under this scheme, 1,932 loans amounting to Rs.l,099 million were guaranteed with a Central Bank liability of Rs.871 million. The scheme ceased, to operate at the end of 1992 as the resources available to the National Development Bank (NDB) to provide refinance were fully committed by that date.

At the end of 1993, 51 loans amounting to Rs.28 million had been fully repaid, while 114 guarantees to the value of Rs.66 million had either lapsed or been withdrawn due to non compli­ance with the Central Bank's operating instructions by the PCIs.

A total of 6 claims amounting to Rs.3.7 million was received by the end of 1993, where the Central Bank's liability was Rs.2.3 million. Of these, two claims amounting to Rs.0.39 million have been settled and .an interim settlement of Rs.0.3 million was made in respect of one claim. At the end of 1993, two claims amounting to Rs.0.8 million were outstanding while one claim for Rs.0.6 million was rejected.

The total premia collected under the scheme upto the end of 1993 amounted to Rs.12.6 million. Table 2.8 summarises the performance of the scheme.

Housing Guarantee Low Income Shelter Programme (HGLISP) Phase IV

The refinance scheme under the Housing Guarantee Low Income Shelter Programme (HGLISP) - Phase IV, which was inaugurated in July 1992, recorded significant progress in 1993. The Central Bank functions as the Apex Lender under this scheme. Refinance facilities are granted by the Central Bank from funds loaned to the Government of Sri Lanka under the United States Government Housing Loan Guarantee Programme - Phase IV. These funds are made available to the participating credit institutions designated as Sub Apex Lenders (SALs)/Direct Primary Lenders (DPLs) who have entered into an agreement with the Central Bank under the HGLISP Programme. At present, Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, Hatton National Bank Ltd., State Mortgage & Invest­ment Bank, Seylan Bank Ltd., Commercial Bank Ltd., Housing Development Finance Corporation and the Regional Rural Development Banks of Kurunegala, Kandy, Kegalle, Puttalam, Galle and Badulla participate as Sub Apex Lenders under this scheme. The National Housing Development Authority participates in this scheme, through the Bank of Ceylon. Loans are granted under this scheme for any purpose related to owner occupied housing, including acquisition of land for house construction, additions/improvements and renovation to existing houses. Households earning a monthly income of Rs.4,600 or less are eligible to obtain loans under this scheme.

A statistical profile of the performance of HGLISP is given in Tables 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12. The salient features of the performance of HGLISP are as follows:

As at the end of 1993, Rs.246 million had been approved as refinance on loans under this programme, of which Rs.l37 million had been disbursed. Half the loans approved under this scheme were for construction ofriew houses while loans for improvement of houses made up about a third of loans approved. While loans under this scheme have been for amounts upto Rs. 100,000, over half of these loans have been for amounts below Rs. 10,000, with a further 12 per cent of loans being for Rs.l0,000 - Rs.l5,000. The high proportion of small loans indicates that the scheme has catered largely to the low income groups. In fact the National Housing Development Authority, which lends mainly to borrowers eligible under the 1.5 million housing programme, accounted for around 70 per cent of the total loans approved as at the end of 1993. Nearly 80 per cent of loans under this scheme were for the rural sector. About half of the loans have been for periods of 6 to 10 years, with nearly a third of the loans being for periods upto 5 years and about a fifth of the loans for periods from 11 to 15 years. The breakdown of borrowers by gender showed that 30 per cent of borrowers in the Rural sector and 36 per cent of borrowers in the Urban sector respectively, were female.

Investment of SMI and BPL Guarantee Fund Resources

Investment of SMI & BPL Guarantee Fund Resources in the Primary Treasury bill market which commenced in July 1988, continued during 1993. Investments and the premia collected at the end of 1993 totalled Rs.492 million. Interest income from investments in 1993 amounted to Rs.72 million.

Entrepreneurship Development Programme (EDP)

The EDP aims at upgrading technical and management skills of existing small industrialists through specially designed training programmes which are held in various districts. Training pro­grammes have been organised to benefit industry sub-groups such as electroplating, iron and steel product manufacture and food processing operating at village level. Programmes are also held for the benefit of school leavers and Janasaviya recipients to create an awareness of self-employment projects. The impact of programmes already conducted is being monitored in collaboration with the Industrial Development Board and the respective Regional Rural Development Banks. Funds nec­essary for this purpose were approved by the World Bank in late 1993. Six training programmes have been initially planned for 1994 and further training programmes will be organised on the basis of identified training needs of small industrialists in the various districts.

Follow-up and Inspection of Projects

During 1993, inspection of SMI projects continued in order to monitor their viability and operation. A total of 27S projects was inspected with a view to recommending corrective action where necessary and to settling claims lodged by the PCIs. The majority of projects were located in the districts of Colombo, Galle, Puttalam, Gampaha, Anuradhapura, Kandy, Ratnapura and Matara.

RURAL CREDIT

In 1993, as in the previous year, the Bank continued to act as the credit executing agency for the following foreign funded projects for the upliftment of agriculture and the rural sector.

(xxm)

1. International Fund for Agricultural Development (JFAD) funded Kegalle District Inte­grated Rural Development Project.

2. Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project (Phase II).

3. ADB funded Small Holder Tea Development Project.

4. ADB funded Mid-Country Perennial Crop Development Project.

5. ADB funded Agriculture Rehabilitation Project.

6. ADB funded Southern Province Rural Development Project.

7. ADB funded North Western Province Water Resources Development Project (NWP/ WRD Project).

8. The EPAD and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) funded Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project.

Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development Project

The Integrated Rural Development Project in the Kegalle District, which has a credit compo­nent of SDR 1.55 million, commenced operations on October 15, 1987, was scheduled to be terminated on December 31, 1994. Loans granted under this project are entitled to 100 per cent refinance. In respect of medium term agricultural and industrial loans, 75 per cent refinance is provided out of project funds, while the remaining 25 per cent is provided out of the Central Bank (CBSL) funds. In respect of cultivation loans, 50 per cent of the amount granted per year in excess of Rs.330,000/- is eligible for reimbursement out of IFAD funds. The amount disbursed under all categories of the Project stood at Rs.64 million as at 31.12.93 against a total allocation of Rs.90 million (SDR 1.55 million).

Kirindi Oya Irrigation & Settlement Project

The Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project, which provides training, supporting serv­ices and finances for the purchase of two wheel tractors to farmers in the project area, has the Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank and Hambantota Regional Rural Development Bank (RRDB) as its Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs). The project was terminated on 31st December, 1993. The amount disbursed under this Project stood at Rs.19.56 million as at 31.12.93 against a total alloca­tion of Rs.46.48 million (SDR 762 million).

Small Holder Tea Development Project

Under the Small Holder Tea Development Project, which has a credit component of US$ 19.1 million, refinance amounting to Rs.32 million was provided by the Bank to PCIs during 1993 in respect of loans disbursed for field development (new planting and replanting), nursery develop­ment and factory rehabilitation. With a view to expediting the disbursement of funds under the project, a project awareness programme was launched by the Bank during 1993, targetting tea small holders, factory owners and PCI managers. During the year, several revisions were effected to the credit scheme, such as the enhancement of the credit guarantee cover from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for field development loans below Rs. 100,000 and the relaxation of the security requirements for loans below Rs.50,000 for those borrowers who do not possess clear land titles, and simplifica­tion of the loan procedures.

(XXIV)

During 1993, the value of loans disbursed increased by 72 per cent compared to the previous year. This increase is mainly reflected in the increased disbursement of loans for factory develop­ment during 1993. As at end 1993, total refinance granted by the Central Bank under the credit scheme stood at Rs.75 million, consisting of Rs.12 million granted for field development, Rs.9 million for nursery development and Rs.54 million for factory rehabilitation as against a total allocation of Rs.935.9 million under the credit component.

Seylan Bank Ltd., was admitted as a PCI under the scheme during the year under review.

Mid-Country Perennial Crop Development Project

The Perennial Crop Development Project Credit Scheme, which is in its fifth year of imple­mentation, is designed to provide credit facilities to farmers with funds obtained from the ADB for the purpose of increasing the production and improving the commercialisation of perennial crops, particularly minor export crops and food crops. In view of the slow disbursement of funds, a reformulation of the project was effected in mid-1993 with a view to expediting the loan disburse­ments under the project. The reformulation included the extension of the project area to the districts of Gampaha, Kurunegala and Puttalam, removal of the minimum landholding size required for obtaining credit facilities, an increase in the credit guarantee cover from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for loans below Rs.200,000/- and the inclusion of subsidiary food crops and coconut cultivation as intercrops with perennial crops and dairy development. Consequently, Seylan Bank and the RRDBs of Puttalam, Kurunegala and Gampaha districts have been admitted as Participating Credit Institu­tions. Credit facilities under this project are provided for on-farm crop development, private nurs­ery development and on-farm post harvest handling and processing activities of perennial crops. As at end 1993, a cumulative total of Rs.34.9 million had been disbursed by the Central Bank as refinance. The amount disbursed during the year was Rs.17.5 million.

Agriculture Rehabilitation Project

The main objective of the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP) is the provision of credit facilities for financing the capital requirements of projects for the rehabilitation of persons and property affected by the civil disturbances in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and the five bordering districts of Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Moneragala and Hambantota. The project aims at revitalising the agriculture, livestock, fisheries and agri-business sectors which can complement and encourage farm production and expand employment and income generation. The Project Management Unit (PMU) which was set up in the Bank in 1991 to implement the credit component had provided refinance facilities totalling Rs.499.3 million to banks in respect of 9,916 sub loans granted by them at the end of 1993. The PMU had carried out a vigorous publicity campaign to create an awareness of the scheme among borrowers. Consequently, a heavy demand had been created for the sub loans under the scheme and the PMU had been able to disburse more than 80 per cent of the total allocation within a short period. Recoveries of these sub loans has commenced and the PMU has directed the PCIs to re-lend the recoveries to the applicants who had not been provided with financial assistance in the first round.

Southern Province Rural Development Project (SPRDP)

The main objective of the Southern Province Rural Development Project funded by the ADB is to raise the income and quality of life of people in the Southern Province through the creation of income and employment generating opportunities in the project area. For this purpose, financial assistance is made available for persons to initiate industrial and self-employment projects in the Southern Province.

( X X V )

The Bank functions as the executing agency for the credit component of the project. The Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) and the three RRDBs at Galle, Matara and Hambantota have been adtnitted as PCIs. Under the project, refinance is provided by the Bank for financing small/medium scale industries located at Charley Mount Industrial Estate in Weligama and other small/medium scale rural enterprises in the Southern Province. While sub loan agree­ments were signed with the PCIs in late 1993, the disbursement of funds is expected to be resumed during the following year.

North-Western Province Water Resources Development Project

The Bank commenced the operation of the credit scheme of the North Western Province (NWP) Water Resources Development Project in the last quarter of 1993. Under the credit scheme, refinance will be provided to the participating banks for on-lending to farmers for the construction of agro-wells and lift irrigation schemes and to rural women for self-employment projects during the period 1993 to 1998. The credit scheme is being implemented in the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts with the RRDBs at Kurunegala, Puttalam and the Hatton National Bank Ltd.

The total cost of the credit scheme is US$ 2.8 million, of which US$ 1.8 million will be from ADB funds. The balance will be provided by the Government of Sri Lanka as a subsidy for agro-well construction and by sub-borrowers as their equity contribution.

As at end 1993, 18 loans for self-employment projects were approved and a sum of Rs.200,000/- had been disbursed by participating banks.

Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project

The Bank continued to function as the implementing agency for the above project. The Project was introduced in 1990 with the goal of raising the general welfare of approximately 32,870 impoverished rural households in the districts of Galle, Matara, Puttalam and Kandy through the provision of a cost-effective credit delivery system and other support services and to aid economic development in general.

For the project, IF AD has provided a loan of SDR 4.85 million and CIDA has provided a grant of SDR 4.75 million.

The number of loans approved as at end December, 1993 in the Kandy and Puttalam (IFAD) districts was 12,866 amounting to Rs.92.37 million, while 5,003 loans amounting to Rs.34.18 million had been approved in the Galle and Matara (CIDA) districts. The overall achievement upto the end of 1993 was 70 per cent of the credit disbursement targets setout in the Appraisal Report for the first four years of operation.

The loan recovery rates achieved so far have been satisfactory and averaged 92 per cent and 84 per cent on all payments falling due in the IFAD and CIDA districts, respectively.

There are 8 Participating Agencies (PA) (Government and non-Government) involved with Project activities other than the project district offices.

Computerisation of project financial reporting and Monitoring and Evaluation activities has been undertaken by the Canadian Executive Agency (CEA). Further Research and Development activities relating to viable economic activities in the project areas have also been undertaken under the Technical Assistance (TA) programme of the Project.

Under institutional strengthening, the four RRDBs of the districts have been provided with computers and relevant software packages, in addition to training provided to the staff of the RRDBs.

(XXVI)

Inland Bill Scheme

The Inland Bill Scheme continued to operate during the year, with the approval of four acceptance credit limits amounting to Rs.6.9 million, thus bringing the total number of such limits to 34. This scheme was introduced in 1989 in order to assist green leaf suppliers and Bought Leaf Factory Owners in the tea sector through commercial banks. Subsequently, this scheme was ex­tended to provide financial assistance to buyers and sellers of milk through the Nuwara Eliya RRDB.

REGIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS (RRDBs)

During 1993 the RRDBs expanded their activities significantly, thus continuing their efforts towards developing the rural economy.

Branch Network of RRDBs

With the establishment of the Gampaha RRDB the total number of RRDBs in operation increased to 17 in 1993. During the current year, 5 RRDBs established 7 new branches, bringing the number of RRDB branches to a total of 163. Details of the branch network of RRDBs are given in Table 2.13.

Deposit Mobilisation

The total value of deposits mobilised by RRDBs at the end of the current year stood at Rs.l,099 million in respect of a total of 720,908 accounts, indicating an increase of 65 per cent in the value of deposits and 26 per cent in the number of accounts, when compared with 1992. This

(XXVII)

reflects the efforts taken by RRDBs to mobilise rural savings and thereby channel these savings to the institutional sector. Of the total value of deposits, savings deposits amounted to Rs.979 million while the value of fixed deposits totalled Rs.120 million, indicating increases of 67 per cent and 50 per cent respectively over 1992. The average value of a savings account, which was Rs. 1,031 in 1992, increased by 33 per cent to Rs. 1,367 in 1993, while the average value of a fixed deposit increased by 11 per cent from Rs.23,675 in 1992 to Rs.26,307 in 1993. The introduction of attractive savings schemes, the expansion of branches, the provision of mobile banking facilities in unbanked and underbanked areas and the expansion of rural economic activities are among the main reasons that contributed to the increase in deposit mobilisation by the RRDBs.

Delivery of Credit

During the year 1993, RRDBs disbursed Rs.966 million in respect of 72,176 loans as against Rs.703 million disbursed in respect of 70,709 loans during 1992. The number of loans increased by 2 per cent, whereas the amount of loans increased by 37 per cent, reflecting an increase in the average size of a loan from Rs.9,945 in 1992 to Rs. 13,390 in 1993.

As in previous years, agriculture occupied a major portion of the total loan portfolio of RRDBs and accounted for 44 per cent of the total value of loans granted in 1993. The amount of loans granted for commerce and business, small industries and various other sectors accounted for 18 per cent, 10 per cent and 28 per cent respectively.

As at the end of 1993, the cumulative amount of loans outstanding in RRDBs was Rs.1,515 million in respect of 226,717 loans.

Advances granted against the pledge of gold and gold articles recorded a significant expansion to Rs.411 million in respect of 156,757 loans in 1993, as against Rs.172 million and 65,125 loans in 1992.

Other Activities

The year 1993 witnessed an impressive expansion in ancillary services provided by RRDBs to their customers. These services included co-ordinating beneficiary training programmes for their customers on subjects such as entrepreneur development, resource identification and financing, and scientific and technological problems involved in livestock and other small scale projects.

RRDBs continued to hold "Janahamuwa" meetings organised at village level, as a means of linking weaker sections of the rural community with RRDB programmes. Credit facilities were extended to groups consisting of 5 to 7 like minded persons drawn from a similar socio-economic background. The security for such loans were inter se guarantees. Such schemes were operated by almost all RRDBs. The organisation of people into groups and the extension of credit on flexible terms and conditions assisted in bringing them into the mainstream of development.

RRDBs also played an important role in assisting rural producers in marketing their produce. RRDBs provided facilities for the storage of paddy, peanuts, chillies, maize etc., valued at Rs.34.5 million, thereby enabling farmers to obtain reasonable prices after the harvesting season. Arrange­ments were also made by RRDBs to provide their customers with seed paddy, fertilizer, agro chemicals, spray machines, water pumps and various other inputs at concessionary rates. The delivery of credit to the rural poor accompanied by such ancillary services paved the way for RRDBs to play a significant role in developing the rural economy.

With the aim of supporting the gove/nment in its poverty alleviation programme, the RRDBs continued to implement several credit schemes. As at the end of 1993, 16,233 loans amounting to Rs.100 million were granted by RRDBs to Janasaviya recipients.

(XXVIII)

RRDBs also continued to act as Participating Credit Institutions under several special credit schemes namely, the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project, the North-Western Province Water Resource Development Project, the Perennial Crop Development Project, the Small Holder Tea Development Project, the Southern Province Rural Development Project and the USAID Housing Guarantee Low Income Shelter Programme.

RURAL BANKING & STAFF TRAINING COLLEGE

The Rural Banking and Staff Training College (RB & STC) of the Central Bank conducted 51 training courses for 1,111 persons during 1993 when compared with 67 training courses conducted for 1,901 persons during 1992.

Out of the 51 training courses conducted in 1993,40 were conducted at the College and the balance 11 were conducted in the outstations and were attended by 292 persons. The participants of those training courses conducted in the outstations were mainly small scale entrepreneurs and self-employed persons who were either already receiving credit facilities provided largely by the Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDBs) or those who anticipated receiving institutional credit facilities made available by the RRDBs. A total of 819 persons, consisting of 311 partici­pants from the Central Bank, 127 from commercial banks, 247 from RRDBs, 82 from the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project and 52 from other institutions attended the 40 courses con­ducted in the College in 1993.

Rural banking, project-oriented development, commercial banking, international trade, foreign exchange operations, management, training of trainers and computer training were the main areas of training provided by the RB & STC in 1993. In addition to the scheduled training courses conducted in 1993, the RB & STC conducted several special training courses on request for the benefit of field level officers attached to: a) the Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project and b) the Perennial Crop Development Project. Two special training programmes were also conducted at the request of the Bank Supervision Department to expose the Acting and Probationary Staff Officers to commercial banking operations.

The RB & STC held the 12th Anniversary lecture on the topic "The Role of Competitive Markets in Rural Development" which was delivered by the Senior Deputy Governor, Mr. A.S. Jayawardene.

The setting-up of the English Language Laboratory at the College is in progress. The labora­tory is expected to be commissioned in April, 1994.

EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND (EPF)

In terms of the Employees' Provident Fund Act No.15 of 1958, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is charged with the responsibility of receiving contributions, surcharges and income from the investment of the monies of the Fund, maintaining proper accounts of regis­tered employers and the individual members of the Fund and also effecting refund of benefits to its members. These activities were carried out in close co-operation with the Employees' Provident Fund Division of the Department of Labour which attends to the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the E.P.F. Act.

Contributions

The contributions received by the Fund during the year 1993 amounted to Rs.6,610.9 million against Rs.5,338.3 million in 1992. This represents an increase of Rs. 1,272.6 million or 23.8 per cent over the level of contributions received during the previous year.

(XXIX)

Members' Balances

Members' balances as at December 31,1993, before allocation of interest for the year under review stood at Rs.62,425.0 million which is an increase of Rs.10,330.1 million or 19.8 per cent over that of 1992.

Investments

During the year under review, the Fund invested a sum of Rs.30,430.5 million in Government Securities, Treasury bills, Inter Bank Call Money Market and Plantation Company Debentures as against a sum of Rs.26,742.4 million in 1992. This is an increase of Rs.3,688.1 million over the level of investments in 1992. The total investments held by the Fund as at December 31, 1993 amounted to Rs.66,532.3 million which is an increase of Rs.11,697.6 million over the level of 1992.

Income Received from Investments

In terms of an amendment to the Inland Revenue Act in 1989, the exemption from income tax granted to the EPF was withdrawn. Accordingly, all income earned on investments with effect from April 01,1989 is subject to a Withholding Tax of 10 per cent. The total Withholding Tax deducted from the investment income for the year 1993 was Rs.922.4 million.

In 1993, the income received from investments amounted to Rs.9,159.6 million as against Rs.6,905.5 million in 1992, recording an increase of Rs.2,254.1 million.

Refunds

The total sum paid out by way of refund of E.P.F. benefits to members during the year 1993, amounted to Rs.2,377.3 million as against Rs.2,265.1 million in 1992. This records an increase of Rs. 112.2 million or 4.9 per cent. During the year under review 51,343 claims for refund of benefits were paid out, as against 49,864 claims disposed of in 1992.

Interest on Members' Balances

The Employees' Provident Fund is required to pay interest on members' Balances as at the end of each year out of the income from investment of monies of the Fund. The rate of interest payable on members balances as at the end of 1993 was 13.5 per cent per annum. This is an increase of 2 per cent over the level of interest in 1992.

Interest is paid on the cumulative balance standing to the credit of members at the end of the year. All contributions received during the year irrespective of the date of receipt of such monies qualify for the payment of the interest for the entire year - e.g., contributions received in December attract interest for the full year in the same way as contributions received in January of that year. Therefore, the effective rate of interest is somewhat higher.

EPF Housing Loan Scheme

The E.P.F. Act was amended by Act No. 42 of 1988 to enable the members to obtain a loan of upto 75 per cent of the balance standing to their credit from certain lending institutions for housing purposes. The participating lending institutions in this scheme are the Housing Development Finance Corporation, the National Housing Development Authority, the State Mortgage and Invest­ment Bank, the People's Bank, the Bank of Ceylon, the National Savings Bank and the Multipur­pose Co-operative Societies spread out in the country.

( X X X )

As at December 31,1993, the E.P.F. Department processed and dispatched a total of 51,289 applications for certification of balances to the respective Labour Offices.

The comparative data for 1992 and 1993 on the operations of the Fund are given in Table 2.14.

EXCHANGE CONTROL

Several steps were taken in 1993 to carry forward the on-going process of exchange control liberalisation. On 15th January, 1993, the limit in respect of the foreign exchange granted to Sri Lankan residents for the following, was increased by 50 per cent - travel abroad for holidays, education, medical treatment and employment, export of gifts and trade samples, export of personal jewellery and personal effects on a bring back basis and capital transfers by emigrants. During the latter part of March 1993, further steps were taken to relax controls in keeping with the Govern­ment policy of removing all restrictions on current account (non-capital) transactions.

The changes effected by the Central Bank were;

Travel

Foreign exchange can now be obtained, without restriction, for the following purposes - travel abroad for holidays and pilgrimages, business including conferences, seminars and workshops, education and medical, including living expenses, and miscellaneous remittances of a bona-fide nature. Authorised Dealers were instructed to issue foreign exchange for those purposes without restriction, at their judgement and discretion, and were informed that endorsement of passports on the release of foreign exchange was not compulsory. The restrictions which prevailed in respect of the quantum of foreign exchange, frequency of travel and the selection of airline were removed. To facilitate foreign travel further, the issue of a reasonable amount of foreign exchange in currency notes was permitted. Moreover, Authorised Dealers were informed on 5th April, 1993, that they could issue International Credit Cards freely, subject to their rules and regulations. Instructions were issued to Authorised Dealers to permit Sri Lankan nationals and foreign technical personnel to remit freely their monthly earnings for the maintenance of their families.

(XXXI)

Exports

The repatriation and surrender requirements imposed on exporters in terms of Sections 22(4) and 6(2) (a) of the Exchange Control Act No. 17 of 1971, were removed by Gazette Extraordinary dated 26th March, 1993, and by Operating Instructions dated 29th March, 1993, respectively. Accordingly, exporters may now either repatriate export proceeds and have these in rupee or foreign currency accounts in Sri Lanka or retain them in foreign currency accounts in a commercial bank abroad. The facility granted to exporting companies to credit 5 per cent of the incremental value of their exports to Resident Foreign Currency Accounts was withdrawn. Shipping agents and freight forwarders were permitted to open and operate foreign currency accounts with the commis­sion and profits received from their foreign principals for services rendered, subject to certain conditions. The facility of maintaining foreign currency accounts with payments received from travel agents/charter operators was granted to hoteliers on 4th October 1993, subject to certain conditions. Authorised Dealers were permitted to remit a reasonable percentage of the F.O.B. value of export earnings as commission to agents abroad, provided the export proceeds had been repatri­ated to Sri Lanka by the exporter. Provision was made to deduct the commission due to the buyer at source, if the buyer was also the agent.

Authorised Dealers were informed that, with effect from 15th January 1993, foreign currency loans to direct and indirect exporters for the purpose of financing the import of foreign inputs required to execute export orders, should be made available only from funds in NRFC, RFC and RNNFC Accounts in their domestic unit.

The Director General of Customs was informed that the Customs could permit, at its discre­tion, the export of jewellery, trade samples, gifts and personal effects without a permit from the Exchange Control Department.

Imports

Procedures associated with foreign exchange transactions in respect of imports were simpli­fied. Importers may now import any item, with the exception of a few items which require prior licensing, on deferred payment terms subject to the establishment of usance Letters of Credit for such imports. The exemption granted for the import of raw material for industry and books upto the value of US$ 3,000 without the requirement to establish Letters of Credit, was further amended on 11th June 1993, to permit the import of labels, lace trimmings etc. on a commercial basis. In addi­tion to this facility, importers were also permitted to import goods in commercial quantities upto US$ 7,500 on Documents on Payment (D/P) terms without the establishment of Letters of Credit. Commercial banks were permitted to extend Letters of Credit for a period of 6 months beyond the normal validity, provided there was no enhancement in the value.

The requirement of settlement of bills in terms of ACU arrangements in respect of merchan­dise imports'and invisible import transactions with India was re-introduced on 28th April, 1993.

Authorised Dealers may permit owners of duty free shops at the Colombo International Air­port who import goods for sale at their shops, the facility of importing goods on Documents on Acceptance (D/A) terms without Letters of Credit being established. The period of usance allowed may be extended upto 180 days from the date of the Bill of Lading. Import of goods on D/P sight terms was also permitted.

Entrepot Trade

Authorised Dealers were permitted to approve applications for the import of goods for entrepot trade on D/P terms and D/A terms without Letters of Credit being established, subject to

(XXXII)

certain conditions. The import of textile fabric, garments, cloves, narcotics, and arms and ammuni­tion for re-export under entrepot trade was strictly prohibited.

Forward Sales

Commercial banks were permitted to enter into contracts for the sale of foreign exchange forward for a period upto 360 days, irrespective of the purpose.

Emigration

Authorised Dealers were permitted to release reasonable amounts of foreign exchange to Sri Lankans who are emigrating. The value of the capital transfers was enhanced to Rs.750,000 per individual, subject to a ceiling of Rs. 1.0 million per family unit. The export of personal jewellery by emigrants was enhanced to Rs. 150,000 for a married female and Rs.37,500 for a male. Export of persona! effects upto a reasonable value could be permitted by Authorised Dealers. Effective from 24th December 1993, the full value of the incomes derived from investments in Sri Lanka, includ­ing interest and rents, was permitted to be remitted out without reference to the Exchange Control Department.

Pensions

Sri Lankans living abroad either temporarily or permanently are free to remit their full pen­sions without any restrictions.

Investment

Authorised Dealers were permitted to approve the export of share certificates issued by com­panies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange to non-resident investors, provided such shares were purchased out of funds in Share Investment External Rupee Accounts (SIERA).

Guidelines relating to the maintenance of Special Rupee Current Accounts opened and oper­ated by Branch Offices registered in Sri Lanka and repatriation of profits of Branch Offices/Liaison Offices were issued to Authorised Dealers on 25th June, 1993.

Non-Resident Rupee Account

The Non-Resident Rupee Account Scheme was revised to permit local credits and outward remittances excluding funds derived from capital transactions, without the prior approval of the Controller of Exchange. However, in the case of emigrants, debits in respect of outward remit­tances of funds derived from both capital and current account transactions are subject to the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control.

PUBLIC DEBT

The Bank continued to manage the Public Debt on behalf of the Government in terms of Section 113 of the Monetary Law Act. As in previous years, this function was carried out by the Public Debt Department. The main debt instruments used by the Public Debt Department were Government Securities/Loans, Treasury bills, Debentures and Treasury Certificates of Deposit. In addition, the issue of Central Bank securities was also undertaken by the Department. The Depart­ment also handled the-management and servicing of foreign debt of the Government. Further, maintenance and development of a data base on both foreign debt and domestic debt has been a

(XXXIH)

significant part of the work of the Department. Studies were also undertaken to assist in the formulation of policies relating to different aspects of Public Debt.

The total outstanding gross Government debt as at end of 1993, which included Government Guaranteed General Service Manual (GSM) Loans serviced by Bank of Ceylon was Rs.498,255.2 million.This was an increase of Rs.78,216.9 million, when compared with the debt at the end of 1992. The outstanding external debt liabilities as at end of 1993 amounted to Rs.274,216.6 million indicating an increase of Rs.34,072.4 million of which Rs.23,134.5 million was on account of exchange rate depreciation. Of the total outstanding Government debt, foreign debt accounted for 55.0 per cent while the balance 45.0 per cent represented domestic debt. Government Rupee Loans amounting to Rs.28,204.6 million were floated during 1993. Total repay­ments of Rupee Loans and interest payments during the year amounted to Rs.20,230.9 and Rs.l 1,739.4 million, respectively. The amount outstanding of Rupee Loans as at end of 1993 was Rs. 105,707.1 million and this included Rs.24,088.0 million of long term bonds issued by the Government in connection with the restructuring of the two State banks. The Employees' Provident Fund was the major subscriber to the Rupee Loan Programme in 1993 and held 60.9 per cent of the total Rupee Loans outstanding as at end of 1993. The National Savings Bank, the second largest subscriber, held 12.5 per cent of the Rupee Loan outstanding.

The authorised limit on Treasury bills (TBs) which was increased from Rs.90,000 million to Rs.l25,000 million on 16th December 1992 remained unchanged during 1993. The Bank continued to operate the Primary Dealer System introduced on 24th July, 1992 in order to activate and develop the secondary market for Treasury bills. Accordingly, only Accredited Primary Dealers (APDs) were allowed to bid at weekly tenders and the public had to purchase Treasury bills from these dealers. However, non-competitive bids from captive sources that included National Savings Bank (NSB), approved provident funds, Employees' Trust Fund (ETF) and other funds were also accepted at the weighted average rates for respective maturity periods. At the end of 1993, there was no change in the number of initially appointed Accredited Primary Dealers (APDs), who included thirteen commercial banks, four money broking firms and one management company of a Unit Trust.

During the second quarter of 1993, tenders for Treasury bills of 24 months, 36 months and 48 months were suspended due to poor response received for investment in such longer term maturities. The Department continued to issue Treasury bills with maturity periods of 3, 6 and 12 months. In addition, short dated bills, which were less than 3 months maturities were also issued to the Central Bank to sell in the secondary market. As a part of monetary management strategy, the Monetary Operations Unit (MOU) continued to make decisions with regard to auctions of Treasury bills on such matters as amounts to be offered and maturity structure of Central Bank allocations etc. on a weekly basis.

A significant development of Treasury bill operations during 1993 was the sharp decline in the amount of Treasury bills held by the Central Bank from Rs.25,997.5 million or 29.9 per cent of total outstanding at the end of 1992 to Rs.5,978.0 million or 6.2 per cent of total outstanding at the end of 1993. The non Central Bank sector holdings increased from Rs.61,098.1 million or 70.1 per cent of total outstanding at the end of 1992 to Rs.91,217.7 million or 93.8 per cent of total outstanding as at the end of 1993. Meanwhile, total Treasury bills outstanding as at end 1993 was Rs.97,195.7 million compared with Rs.87,095.7 million at the end of the previous year. This increase resulted from the new issues of Treasury bills amounting to Rs. 13,600 million and retire­ments of treasury bills worth Rs.3,500 million. The total interest paid during the year in respect of Treasury bills was Rs.l2,957.7 million.

The weighted average yield rates for 3, 6 and 12 months Treasury bills ranged from 16.94-21.91, 17.44-21.06 and 17.82-21.98 per cent per annum respectively, during the year under review.

(XXXIV)

The Bank continued to issue Government Treasury Certificates of Deposit (TCDs), which commenced during 1990. The Certificates were issued for 6,12 and 24 months maturity periods at per annum rates of interest of 17.15 per cent, 18.06 per cent and 19.83 per cent, respectively. The face value of the TCDs sold by the NSB and the Currency Department of the Central Bank amounted to Rs.62,922,000 and Rs.44,006,000 respectively. The corresponding repayments in respect of these two sources were Rs.64,129,000 and Rs.31,006,000 respectively, while these repayments included Rs. 17,864,719 of interest payments. The amount outstanding of TCDs as at end 1993 was Rs.113.8 million.

The Department commenced the issue of Central Bank Securities (CBS) on 19th October, 1993 in order to absorb excess liquidity in the market. The CBS, amounting to Rs.884 million and Rs.l,271 million for maturity periods of 3 months and 6 months, respectively (with a coupon rate of 18 per cent per annum), were issued to the APDs during the year 1993. The weighted per annum average yield rates of these issues ranged from 18.56 per cent to 20.04 per cent and from 19.23 per cent to 21.44 per cent for maturities of 3 months and 6 months, respectively.

The total disbursements on medium and long term external Government debt during 1993 amounted to Rs.l7,891.6 million. Project loans accounted for 68.0 per cent of the total amount utilised while the balance was in respect of non-project loans. The total interest payment and other charges on external Government debt in 1993 was Rs.5,182.5 million.

REGIONAL OFFICES - MATARA, ANURADHAPURA AND MATALE

During 1993, the three Regional Offices of the Central Bank at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale continued to carry out their development activities in addition to pursuing the traditional central banking functions assigned to them. The main activities of the Regional Offices included currency operations, cheque clearing activities, data collection activities, conducting beneficiary training programmes, inspection of the activities of the RRDBs and co-ordination with Government departments, agencies and organisations involved in development work in the respective regions.

The Matara Regional Office handled activities relating to the implementation of the Small Holder Tea Development (SHTD) Project, Inland Bill Scheme, the Southern Province Rural Devel­opment (SPRD) Project and the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS). In addition to conducting seminars on these credit schemes, the post-supervision activities in connection with these credit projects was continued. The Regional Office also carried out an inspection of three bank branches of the Matara and Hambantota RRDBs.

The Anuradhapura Regional Office, in association with other Government institutions, con­ducted 51 beneficiary training programmes for over 2000 prospective borrowers on a variety of subjects including dairy development and rice processing. The Regional Office co-ordinated work in connection with the Village Development Project sponsored by the Central Bank at Negampaha and was associated with two dairy development projects in Thirappane and Kekirawa. The Re­gional Office also conducted the inspection of six branches of the Kurunegala, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa RRDBs.

In 1993, the Matale Regional Office conducted several training programmes for Janasaviya recipients, dairy farmers, unemployed youth and farmers, bankers and school children. In addition, a number of "Janahamuwa" meetings was organised among potential borrowers in remote areas in order to create an awareness of credit schemes. The Regional Office continued its activities in respect of the Small Holder Tea Development (SHTD) Project Credit Scheme and the Perennial Crop Development Credit Scheme. This office also carried out the inspection of eight branches of the Mahanuwara, Matale, Nuwara Eliya and Kegalle RRDBs.

(XXXV)

In carrying out the traditional central banking functions, the Regional Offices at Matara and Anuradhapura continued to provide currency exchange facilities. Further, the Regional Offices provided regional cheque clearing facilities. A total of 161,462 cheques with a total value of Rs.2,112 million was cleared through the Regional Cheque Clearing House at Matara, 135,440 cheques amounting to Rs. 1,559 million were cleared through the Anuradhapura Cheque Clearing House and 575,720 cheques valued at Rs.l3,775 million were cleared through the Cheque Clearing Houses of the Matale Regional Office in Kandy and Matale.

SECRETARIAT

The Secretariat Department continued to provide all administrative services of the Bank in the fields of finance, legal services, supplies, travel and other services.

The Legal Division was actively engaged in examining the recommendations of the Presiden­tial Commission on Finance and Banking and the recommendations of the Financial Sector Reform committee, relating to the activities of the Central Bank, and consequently co-ordinated with the Legal Draftsman's Department to prepare the amendements to the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 to introduce further provisions to strengthen the Central Bank's powers in relation to the supervision of commercial banks, and to introduce amendments to incorporate provisions of the Banking (Special Provisions) Regulation No. 2 of 1990, which enable the Central Bank to vest the business of an insolvent commercial bank or part of its business in another commercial bank.

The Legal Division was also engaged in the preparation of legislation for the amendments of the Monetary Law Act, Treasury Bills Ordinance and the Registered.Stocks and Securities Ordi­nance to provide legal provision for the issue of scripless Government Securities and to facilitate the smooth functioning of the work of the primary dealers who are authorised to deal in the retailing of government securities.

The preparation of the Bill to amend the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Law No. 2 of 1990 to streamline the legal procedure governing the debt recovery of financial institutions was also a matter with which the Legal Division actively associated itself.

INFORMATION AND PUBLICATIONS

The Information Department continued to play a major role in the Central Bank's functions as a collector and disseminator of information. In the process of information collection it made every effort to cover socio-economic development domestically and worldwide, and provided both pub­lished and unpublished material to students, teachers, bankers, researchers and others who were interested in studying economic development. The following Central Bank publications released through the Information Department were the main sources of information dissemination:

The Library further strengthened its information base with the addition of new books, journals, pamphlets etc. During the year, the Library added 320 books and pamphlets and subscribed to 236 periodical titles. It also received 150 books and pamphlets as gifts and exchange from banks, other libraries and institutions.

The Department continued to maintain its good relations with the mass media, particularly with the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, Rupavahini and the newspapers. This enabled the Department to give adequate publicity to the Central Bank's activities and innovative policy meas­ures introduced during the year.

The Video Unit of the Department produced three documentaries covering Central Bank's functions and activities, the Automated Clearing House and the activities of the Employees' Provi­dent Fund. It also covered 19 seminars and important events of the Central Bank. The Art Work Visual Section designed 16 cover pages, brochures and posters.

The Department organised a workshop for Parliamentarians and Policy Makers. The workshop discussed in detail the movements of macro-economic variables.

As in previous years the Department's educational programmes continued to attract a large number of students and teachers. This has become extremely popular in the periphery. The pro­grammes during the year recorded an attendance of over 10,000 students and teachers in the Anuradhapura, Kalutara, Polonnaruwa, Galle, Matara, Nuwara Eliya and Hambantota districts.

Over 90 per cent of the printing work of the Central Bank was handled by the Central Bank Press. During the year the Press successfully completed 278 printing assignments, enabling the Central Bank to save a sum of approximately Rs.2 million.

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

The officers of the Bank undertook a number of research studies both on their own initiative and also to meet the demands made by other organisations. They included policy oriented research as well as studies which were largely of academic interest. Eight of these studies have been published in the Central Bank's Staff Studies, Volume 22.

SURVEYS AND DATA COLLECTION

Survey of Credit Needs with Special Emphasis on the Poor - 1992/1993

The field work of the Survey of Credit Needs with Special Emphasis on the Poor, which commenced in May 1992, was completed in October, 1993. The main objective of this Survey was to ascertain the credit needs of the economically disadvantaged sectors with a view to formulating a national credit policy for formal lending. Obtaining information on the extent to which institutional credit had reached different income groups and the manner in which such credit had been utilized for income generating activities was the other major objective of the survey.

With these objectives in view, information relating to sources of credit, credit usage, entrepre-neurship, income generating activities, and loan repayment was collected from sampled households by means of field visits. In order to afford an in-depth analysis of credit needs, information on socio-economic conditions such as demographic characteristics, housing conditions, land use, la­bour force, employment and manpower use, household income, savings, and indebtedness were also collected from the households.

In this Survey, approximately 33,000 households, sampled from 43 urban wards representing the Urban sector, 216 villages representing the Rural sector and 10 estates representing the Estate sector were enumerated. Data collection continued for over a period of one year in order to capture seasonal variations.

Processing of data collected in this Survey is in progress.

Country-wide Data Collection Scheme

The Country-wide Data Collection Scheme which was launched in 1978, continued in 1993, thereby completing its fifteenth year of operation. Data on retail prices of consumer goods, pro­ducer prices of a large number of commodities, costs of major agricultural inputs and daily wage rates for activities in paddy cultivation, tea, rubber, coconut cultivation in the non-formal sector and in small scale construction continued to be collected from selected centres on a regular basis. The information under this scheme is collected by selected government school teachers.

National Accounts

The essential activities in connection with the estimation of National Income Accounts contin­ued. These included the collection and compilation of primary and secondary data. Wherever possible, data were collected on a half yearly or quarterly basis. More comprehensive data from a variety of sources are being obtained to assist in the efforts of the Bank to improve the estimation of national income. Preliminary work has been commenced to institute a revision of the estimation procedures, which will include the move to a national income accounts series with a more current base year. Substantial progress has been achieved in the preparation of a new Manual on the principles,'policies and methodology of National Income Accounting adopted by the Central Bank.

Monitoring of Imports

The Statistics Department continued to monitor imports through data collected from commer­cial banks on Letters of Credit (LCs), for the purpose of import forecasting.

Employment Statistics

The annual survey of Employment in thfi Public Sector continued in 1993. The objective of this Survey is to ascertain the trends in employment in Government Departments, Ministries,

(XXXVIII)

Provincial Councils, Local Authorities and in the Corporation Sector. In addition, data were also collected from administrative records such as the Employees' Provident Fund and other Provident Funds to ascertain the trends in employment in the Formal Private Sector.

DATA PROCESSING

During the year under review the Data Processing Department (DPD) continued to maintain the existing computerised applications in the bank with necessary improvements as requested by the user departments. Among the major applications handled by the DPD were the Employees' Provident Fund and the Survey of Credit Needs with Special Emphasis on the Poor. Further, the DPD undertook to develop and successfully completed a number of personal computer based applications in a stand alone environment in the user departments.

The Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House which comes under the DPD, saw a growth of 12 per cent over last year in the number of cheques cleared. The total number of items cleared in 1993 was 22 million.

A new system to carry out interbank payments within the country, named "Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System" (SLIPS) was implemented this year. This is an off-line interbank funds transfer system. Initially, SLIPS will cater to direct interbank payments such as call-money market transactions, foreign exchange settlements and settlement of refinance facilities. With the expan­sion of the SLIPS, institutions will be able to make use of this system to pay the salaries of their employees without writing cheques. Banks can also make use of this system for executing standing orders, insurance payments etc. This system is also capable of handling utility bill payments. The inbuilt security features of this system are similar to ones used for such payments in other parts of the world and ensure a reliable service to the customer. Billing can be effected promptly and accurately. SLIPS is a typical system used all over the world for carrying out low value but high volume transactions.

TRAINING

Training of officers in academic and non-academic fields continued in 1993. Academic train­ing was related to post-graduate studies in Economics and allied fields at recognised Universities. Officers were enrolled for Masters and Ph.D. degrees. During the year, sixteen officers proceeded abroad to follow Masters Courses and two officers entered Ph.D. programmes. One officer was granted study leave to follow a course in Computer Technology in Sri Lanka which is of one year's duration.

Non-academic training comprising short-term courses, seminars and workshops, both local and foreign, was related to specific fields relevant to the Bank. During 1993, a total of 119 officers proceeded abroad on short term training, while 137 officers participated in training courses, seminars etc. held at local institutions and 231 officers participated in courses conducted by the Rural Banking & Staff Training College.

The Department continued its function of holding promotional examinations for certain categories of employees and the Scholarship Examination for the Staff Class.
