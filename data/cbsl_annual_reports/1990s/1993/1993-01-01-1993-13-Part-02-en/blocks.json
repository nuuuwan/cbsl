Under this scheme, the Central Bank commits itself to buy back on an agreed date, the Treasury bills sold from its holdings. Commercial banks and other institutions which have access to the Secondary Treasury Bill Market of the Bank are eligible to participate in the Scheme.

In terms of Section 102 of the Monetary Law Act, the Monetary Board prescribed these requirements for commercial banks as set out in the Government Gazette Extraordinary No.786/15 of 1st October, 1993. In terms of these requirements, commercial banks were required to satisfy a core capital adequacy ratio of 4 per cent as at 31st December, 1993 and an overall ratio of 8 per cent as at 31st March, 1994. Under the new standard, the adequacy of capital is measured against the risky assets. This is a departure from the earlier practice of measuring capital adequacy against a bank's total liabilities. Commercial banks are required to submit a quarterly return on their capital adequacy in a specified format prescribed by the Department. Regular monitoring will be carried out by the Department on the basis of these returns.",

They would broaden the scope of supervision by bringing hitherto unregulated financial operations such as off-shore operations of commercial banks, within the supervisory ambit of the Central Bank and strengthen the regulatory powers of the Central Bank.

Refinance facilities are granted by the Central Bank from funds loaned to the Government of Sri Lanka under the United States Government Housing Loan Guarantee Programme - Phase IV. These funds are made available to the participating credit institutions designated as Sub Apex Lenders (SALs)/Direct Primary Lenders (DPLs) who have entered into an agreement with the Central Bank under the HGLISP Programme. At present, Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, Hatton National Bank Ltd., State Mortgage & Invest\u00adment Bank, Seylan Bank Ltd., Commercial Bank Ltd., Housing Development Finance Corporation and the Regional Rural Development Banks of Kurunegala, Kandy, Kegalle, Puttalam, Galle and Badulla participate as Sub Apex Lenders under this scheme. The National Housing Development Authority participates in this scheme, through the Bank of Ceylon. Loans are granted under this scheme for any purpose related to owner occupied housing, including acquisition of land for house construction, additions/improvements and renovation to existing houses. Households earning a monthly income of Rs.4,600 or less are eligible to obtain loans under this scheme.",

    "text": "As at the end of 1993, Rs.246 million had been approved as refinance on loans under this programme, of which Rs.l37 million had been disbursed. Half the loans approved under this scheme were for construction ofriew houses while loans for improvement of houses made up about a third of loans approved. While loans under this scheme have been for amounts upto Rs. 100,000, over half of these loans have been for amounts below Rs. 10,000, with a further 12 per cent of loans being for Rs.l0,000 - Rs.l5,000. The high proportion of small loans indicates that the scheme has catered largely to the low income groups. In fact the National Housing Development Authority, which lends mainly to borrowers eligible under the 1.5 million housing programme, accounted for around 70 per cent of the total loans approved as at the end of 1993. Nearly 80 per cent of loans under this scheme were for the rural sector. About half of the loans have been for periods of 6 to 10 years, with nearly a third of the loans being for periods upto 5 years and about a fifth of the loans for periods from 11 to 15 years. The breakdown of borrowers by gender showed that 30 per cent of borrowers in the Rural sector and 36 per cent of borrowers in the Urban sector respectively, were female.",

Programmes are also held for the benefit of school leavers and Janasaviya recipients to create an awareness of self-employment projects. The impact of programmes already conducted is being monitored in collaboration with the Industrial Development Board and the respective Regional Rural Development Banks. Funds nec\u00adessary for this purpose were approved by the World Bank in late 1993. Six training programmes have been initially planned for 1994 and further training programmes will be organised on the basis of identified training needs of small industrialists in the various districts.",

In view of the slow disbursement of funds, a reformulation of the project was effected in mid-1993 with a view to expediting the loan disburse\u00adments under the project. The reformulation included the extension of the project area to the districts of Gampaha, Kurunegala and Puttalam, removal of the minimum landholding size required for obtaining credit facilities, an increase in the credit guarantee cover from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for loans below Rs.200,000/- and the inclusion of subsidiary food crops and coconut cultivation as intercrops with perennial crops and dairy development. Consequently, Seylan Bank and the RRDBs of Puttalam, Kurunegala and Gampaha districts have been admitted as Participating Credit Institu\u00adtions. Credit facilities under this project are provided for on-farm crop development, private nurs\u00adery development and on-farm post harvest handling and processing activities of perennial crops. As at end 1993, a cumulative total of Rs.34.9 million had been disbursed by the Central Bank as refinance. The amount disbursed during the year was Rs.17.5 million.",

The project aims at revitalising the agriculture, livestock, fisheries and agri-business sectors which can complement and encourage farm production and expand employment and income generation. The Project Management Unit (PMU) which was set up in the Bank in 1991 to implement the credit component had provided refinance facilities totalling Rs.499.3 million to banks in respect of 9,916 sub loans granted by them at the end of 1993. The PMU had carried out a vigorous publicity campaign to create an awareness of the scheme among borrowers. Consequently, a heavy demand had been created for the sub loans under the scheme and the PMU had been able to disburse more than 80 per cent of the total allocation within a short period. Recoveries of these sub loans has commenced and the PMU has directed the PCIs to re-lend the recoveries to the applicants who had not been provided with financial assistance in the first round.",

The average value of a savings account, which was Rs. 1,031 in 1992, increased by 33 per cent to Rs. 1,367 in 1993, while the average value of a fixed deposit increased by 11 per cent from Rs.23,675 in 1992 to Rs.26,307 in 1993. The introduction of attractive savings schemes, the expansion of branches, the provision of mobile banking facilities in unbanked and underbanked areas and the expansion of rural economic activities are among the main reasons that contributed to the increase in deposit mobilisation by the RRDBs.",

Banks can also make use of this system for executing standing orders, insurance payments etc. This system is also capable of handling utility bill payments.

Billing can be effected promptly and accurately. SLIPS is a typical system used all over the world for carrying out low value but high volume transactions.",
