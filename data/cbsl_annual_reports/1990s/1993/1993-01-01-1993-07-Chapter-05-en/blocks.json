    "text": "In 1993, there was a significant improvement in the energy situation after the setback suffered during the previous year. Hydro electricity generation which was adversely affected by the severe drought conditions in 1992, improved remarkably in 1993 following favourable weather conditions. Consequently, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was able to reduce its dependence on thermal power to a negligible level during the year. Despite an increase in electricity prices in July 1993, the demand for electricity expanded considerably. Meanwhile, the total demand for petroleum products dropped marginally as a result of the lower usage of heavy diesel and furnace oil for thermal power generation. However, the domestic consumption of major petroleum products such as petrol and auto diesel continued to expand despite price increases.",

However, the total power generated by the CEB at 3,979 GWh recorded a significant growth of 12 per cent compared with a 5 per cent increase in the previous year. This was the highest annual growth in electricity generation experienced during the decade ending 1993. The hydro electricity generation at 3,796 GWh in 1993 recorded an increase of 31 per cent, in contrast to a drop of 7 per cent in the previous year. The increase was entirely due to the improved water levels of the hydro reservoirs. Consequently, the thermal power generation dipped substantially to 183 GWh in 1993 from 640 GWh in 1992 with a resultant drop in cost of fuel on power generation from Rs. 1,658 million in 1992 to Rs. 347 million in 1993.

The tariff revision mainly aimed at achieving a rate of return of 8 per cent on the average net fixed assets, maintaining an internal cash generation of not less than 1.5 times of debt service cover and generating a reasonable proportion of the funds needed for the capital investment programme from internal cash. With respect to the domestic category, the price increase was in a range of 9 per cent to 30 per cent depending on the level of consumption. In the case of other categories, tariffs were increased by about 30 per cent. Meanwhile, the fuel surcharge imposed in March, 1992 to recover the fuel cost on power genera\u00adtion continued throughout 1993 at a reduced rate of 20 per cent.

The scale of operations of the SLR was largely affected by the disruption to train services on the main line as a result of the subsidence of lail track at Watawala. In addition, normal train services to the Northern and Eastern Provinces continued to be suspended in 1993 due to the adverse security situation in those two provinces. However, the adverse impact of these factors on the scale of operations was partly mitigated by the addition of trains to the regular service between Fort and Negombo, the extension of broad gauging of the Keiani Valley line from Nugegocia to Homaganiu and the introduction of a new train service from Anuradhapura to Mihintale.
