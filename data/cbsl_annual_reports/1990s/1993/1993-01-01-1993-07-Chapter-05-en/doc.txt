ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OVERHEADS

ENERGY

In 1993, there was a significant improvement in the energy situation after the setback suffered during the previous year. Hydro electricity generation which was adversely affected by the severe drought conditions in 1992, improved remarkably in 1993 following favourable weather conditions. Consequently, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was able to reduce its dependence on thermal power to a negligible level during the year. Despite an increase in electricity prices in July 1993, the demand for electricity expanded considerably. Meanwhile, the total demand for petroleum products dropped marginally as a result of the lower usage of heavy diesel and furnace oil for thermal power generation. However, the domestic consumption of major petroleum products such as petrol and auto diesel continued to expand despite price increases.

In conformity with the normal pattern, non-commercial energy sources consisting of fuelwood, agricultural residues and animal waste and other ligno cellulosic matter continued to be the major source of energy, representing 5.0 million tons of oil equivalent (t.o.e.) or 68 per cent of the total energy supply (7.3 million t.o.e.) in the country. Commercial energy sources which included petroleum, electricity and liquified petroleum gas (L.P.G.) accounted for the balance 32 per cent.

The total installed capacity of electricity in 1993 at 1,409 MW, comprising 1,137 MW of hydro power and 272 MW of thermal power, remained unchanged when compared with 1992. However, the total power generated by the CEB at 3,979 GWh recorded a significant growth of 12 per cent compared with a 5 per cent increase in the previous year. This was the highest annual growth in electricity generation experienced during the decade ending 1993. The hydro electricity generation at 3,796 GWh in 1993 recorded an increase of 31 per cent, in contrast to a drop of 7 per cent in the previous year. The increase was entirely due to the improved water levels of the hydro reservoirs. Consequently, the thermal power generation dipped substantially to 183 GWh in 1993 from 640 GWh in 1992 with a resultant drop in cost of fuel on power generation from Rs. 1,658 million in 1992 to Rs. 347 million in 1993. Meanwhile, the losses involved in the power generation, transmission and distribution remained at a high level of 17.7 per cent as in the previous year.

Electricity tariffs were revised by the CEB in July 1993. The tariff revision mainly aimed at achieving a rate of return of 8 per cent on the average net fixed assets, maintaining an internal cash generation of not less than 1.5 times of debt service cover and generating a reasonable proportion of the funds needed for the capital investment programme from internal cash. With respect to the domestic category, the price increase was in a range of 9 per cent to 30 per cent depending on the level of consumption. In the case of other categories, tariffs were increased by about 30 per cent. Meanwhile, the fuel surcharge imposed in March, 1992 to recover the fuel cost on power genera­tion continued throughout 1993 at a reduced rate of 20 per cent. The revised electricity rates along with previous rates are given in Table 1.28.

Despite the increase in electricity prices, electricity sales increased by 12 per cent to 3,275 GWh in 1993, the highest rise recorded during the last 10 years. The expansion in electricity sales is partly explained by the rise in total number of electricity consumers by 207,397 to 1,?.82,394 at the end of 1993. Sales to domestic category expanded by 11 per cent to 782 GWh largely reflecting an increase in the number of domestic consumers from 917,319 in 1992 to

64

1,094,371 in 1993 brought about by the implementation of rural electrification schemes. The CEB had completed 15,831 rural electrification schemes by the end of September 1993. Meanwhile, sales to industrial and commercial sectors expanded by 12 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively, reflecting enhanced industrial and commercial activities during the year under review. The bulk sales to local authorities also increased by 14 per cent in 1993.

With a view to expanding, upgrading and rehabilitating the electricity infrastructure, the CEB invested a sum of Rs. 2,731 million in 1993 on major development projects. Of the total invest­ments, around a fourth (Rs. 709 million) was on the Transmission System Augmentation Project funded by the Overseas Economic Corporation Fund (OECF), while Rs. 516 million or nearly a fifth was on the New Rural Electrification Scheme funded by the Asian Development Bank. The other major development projects undertaken were the Medium and Low Voltage Development Project (Rs. 539 million), the Tenth Power Projec: million), the Second Power Distribution & Transmission Project (Rs. 108 million) and the Secondary Town Power Distribution Project (Rs. 82 million).

During the year under review, the total expenditure on petroleum imports rose by 7 per cent to Rs. 14,920 million. The average international price of crude oil (per barrel) further dropped to US$ 17.3 in 1993 from US$ 18.3 in 1992. The volume of crude oil imports rose by 38 per cent from 1,296,518 metric tons in 1992 to 1,790,575 metric tons in 1993 due to the non-interrupted functioning of the oil refinery. Consequently, the import of refined products dropped by 53 per cent to 313,463 metric tons in 1993. Meanwhile, the volume of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) imported by the Colombo Gas Company increased by 6,202 metric tons to 37,584 metric tons during the year raising the value of such imports by 9 per cent to Rs. 541 million.

Prices of major petroleum products, except furnace oil, were revised upward during 1993. The price of kerosene which remained unchanged since 1990, was increased by Rs. 3 per litre (34 per cent) to Rs. 11.80 pei litre. Meanwhile, the price of diesel was revised gradually on 5 occasions from Rs. 11.65 per litre to Rs. 12.20 per litre in 1993. The price of petrol was also raised by Rs. 2 per litre to Rs. 35 per litre in 1993.

During the year under review, domestic consumption of petroleum products totalled 1,417,485 metric tons recording a decrease of 5 per cent in contrast to an increase of 20 per cent in the previous year. The decline in consumption was largely due to the reduced use of heavy diesel and furnace oil for thermal power generation. Between 1992 and 1993, the demand for heavy diesel dropped sharply by 107,254 metric tons to 18,020 metric tons, while the demand for furnace oil decreased by 31,771 metric tons to 219,918 metric tons. In contrast, despite price increases, the sales of petrol and diesel rose by 5 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively between the two years. The consumption of kerosene increased marginally compared with an expansion of 9 per cent in 1992, reflecting the impact of the price increase in 1993. Despite the price increase, the sales of LPG grew significantly by 18 per cent to 52,650 metric tons in 1993 reflecting increased demand of gas for cooking purposes.

During the year under review, certain marketing and distributing activities of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) were privatised. The lubricants blending and marketing segments of the CPC were converted to a public company, called the Lanka Lubricants Ltd., under the Peoplisation Act No. 23 of 1987. The Bunkering operation of the CPC was converted to another private company, namely the Lanka Marine Services (PVT) Ltd., under the Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982.

TRANSPORTATION

As in the previous year, transport sector activities recorded mixed performance in 1993. In terms of scale of operations, the peoplised companies and the private sector passenger transport services further expanded during the year. However, the operations of the Sri Lanka Railways more or less remained unchanged.

The activities of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) in 1993 were largely centered around its programme of peoplisation of bus depots and workshops which commenced in 1990. By the end of 1993, a total of 92 bus companies were established, while 5 workshops including the Werahera Complex were also peoplised. Meanwhile, efforts were made by the peoplised companies to strengthen their bus fleet by purchasing new buses and rehabilitating the existing fleet. By the end of 1993, a total of 750 new buses was added to the existing fleet by the peoplised companies since the commencement of the peoplisation programme in 1990 and the number added in 1993 was 325. As a result of the expanded bus fleet, the average number of buses operated per day by the

peopiised companies rose from 3,550 in 1992 to 3,750 in 1993. Consequently, the operated kilometerage of the peopiised companies at 27S inillior. recorded an increase of 4 per cent over the previous year. Passenger kilometerage at 13,455 million reflected an increase of 5 per cent be­tween the two years. With these developments, the total revenue of the peopiised companies rose by 10 per cent to Rs. 3,023 million, in 1993 over the previous year.

During the year under review, the scale of operations of the Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) in terms of operated kilometerage remained at 8.1 million at the previous year's level, while the scale of goods transportation indicated by cargo ton kilometerage declined by 5 per cent to 167.5 million. The scale of operations of the SLR was largely affected by the disruption to train services on the main line as a result of the subsidence of lail track at Watawala. In addition, normal train services to the Northern and Eastern Provinces continued to be suspended in 1993 due to the adverse security situation in those two provinces. However, the adverse impact of these factors on the scale of operations was partly mitigated by the addition of trains to the regular service between Fort and Negombo, the extension of broad gauging of the Keiani Valley line from Nugegocia to Homaganiu and the introduction of a new train service from Anuradhapura to Mihintale. Also, the quality anc: the availability of the train services were improved by the introduction of more comfortabL-passenger carriages, re-engining of S6 class power coaches with new diesel engines and the

68

provision of through trains from Anuradhapura and Kandy to Matara via Colombo. With these developments, the patronage level of the SLR measured in terms of passenger kilometerages, increased to 2,810 million, indicating an increase of 8 per cent as against a drop of 2 per cent in the previous year. Consequently, the revenue earned from passenger services by the SLR rose by 5 per cent in contrast to a decline of 7 per cent in the previous year. However, the total revenue of SLR during the year under review dropped by 10 per cent due to a decline in receipts from goods transportation and other activities. Meanwhile, the current expenditure rose by 5 per cent to Rs. 1,300 million. Reflecting these revenue and expenditure flows, the operational loss of the SLR rose from Rs. 353 million in 1992 to Rs. 500 million in 1993.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Railway Authority Bill was approved by the Parliament in November, 1993 and steps have been taken to convert the SLR into an autonomous body with the World Bank technical assistance.

Passenger services provided by the private sector expanded further in 1993. The Departments of Private Omnibus Transportation of Provincial Councils excluding those in the Northern and Eastern Provinces issued new route permits totalling 1,811 to private bus operators in 1993. Mean­while, in order to facilitate passenger transport activities further, a new bus assembly scheme was initiated in 1993.

HOUSING

In 1993, housing sector activities continued to expand under the One Point Five Million Houses Programme (OPFMHP). The programme which commenced in 1990 covers a period of six years. Ten sub programmes* have been in operation during the year providing loans and grants to construct new houses, upgrade existing houses and improve the shelter conditions of the poor.

The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA), as the major implementing Agency of the OPFMHP has directly undertaken the Rural Housing Sub Programme (RHSP) and the Urban Housing Sub Programme (UHSP) aimed at assisting low income families in the rural and urban sectors. The activities under the RHSP in terms of families reached reflected a decline from 38,710 in 1992 to 31,078 in 1993. The decrease was largely due to the limitation of funds and the emphasis placed on the completion of existing activities. During the year under review, a total 31,624 housing units was completed with disbursements of Rs. 298 million under the RHSP. The perform­ance of the UHSP showed a significant improvement in terms of availability of credit facilities and completion. During the year, a total of 7,164 families was provided with credit facilities compared with 6,170 families in the previous year. A total of 5,288 housing units was completed in 1993 showing a 52 per cent increase over the previous year. Meanwhile, a total of 295 housing units was completed in and around Colombo, under the special housing programme designed for upper middle income families. The value of loans and grants disbursed under this programme was Rs. 216 million. The Disaster Housing Sub Programme (DHSP) was carried out by the NHDA with the involvement of other agencies such as banks, provincial councils and Government Agents.

* Ten Sub-programmes are Rural Housing Sub Programme (RHSP), Urban Housing Sub Pro­gramme (UHSP), Disaster Housing Sub Programme (DHSP), Provincial Council Housing Sub Programme ((PCHSP), Mahaweli Housing Sub Programme (MHSP), Plantation Housing Sub Programme (PHSP), Co-operative Housing Sub Programme (CHSP), Employee Housing Sub Programme (EHSP), Individual Housing Sub Programme (IHSP) and Private Developers Sub Programme (PDSP).

Under the DHSP, NHDA itself was able to reach only 8,532 families in 1993 compared with 13,969 families in 1992 due to the limited availability of funds. The value of loans and grants disbursed to beneficiaries amounted to Rs. 258 million, while the number of units completed during the year was 7,819. Meanwhile, the NHDA assisted provincial councils in the implementation of the Provincial Council Housing Sub Programme. Under this programme, the NHDA provided grants and credit facilities to 1,633 families enabling them to complete 1,265 housing units during the year under review.

The Plantation Housing Sub Programme, previously undertaken by the Sri Lanka State Planta­tions Corporation (SLSPC) and the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB), was transferred to the Plantation Housing & Social Welfare Trust during the year. This Trust has been established following the privatisation of estate management and is responsible for housing development of the estate workers. The Trust was able to complete 565 units under the Worker Housing Re-Roofing Scheme during 1993. Meanwhile, the Mahaweli Economic Agency completed 3,105 housing units in Systems B, C and H under the Mahaweli Housing Sub Programme during the year under review.

Loans provided by the major banking and financial institutions towards the development of housing activities in the private sector showed a significant improvement in 1993. The Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, State Mortgage & Investment Bank (SMD3), National Savings Bank (NSB) and the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) provided a sum of Rs. 2,204 million for housing purposes in 1993 compared with Rs. 1,744 million in 1992, recording an increase of 26 per cent. The value of loans disbursed by the SMIB increased significantly by 54 per cent to Rs. 466 million in 1993. The number of loans approved by the SMIB increased by 80 per cent to 3,557, while the value of loans approved rose by 115 per cent to Rs. 714 million between the two years. This was the highest value of loan approvals recorded during any single year from the inception of the SMIB. Although the number of loans given by the Bank of Ceylon in 1993 dropped by 3 per cent to 2,243, the value of the loans rose by 34 per cent to Rs. 955 million. The People's Bank also provided Rs. 414 million for the housing sector in respect of 10,258 persons, but this showed a decline compared with the loan disbursements of Rs. 514 million granted to 12,983 applicants during 1992. Meanwhile, the number and the value of loans disbursed by the HDFC also showed a significant improvement. The HDFC disbursed 2,050 loans amounting to Rs. 212 million in 1993 as against 1,520 loans amounting to Rs. 100 million in 1992. The number of housing loans granted by the NSB rose by 35 per cent to 985, while the value of loans disbursed also expanded by 34 per cent to Rs. 156 million between the two years.

URBAN DEVELOPMENT

The activities undertaken by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) expanded during the year under review. The total investments on urban development more than doubled to Rs. 705 million in 1993 from Rs. 338 million spent in the previous year. The increased investments were largely reflected under the integrated projects. A sum of Rs. 485 million or 69 per cent of the total expenditure on urban development was spent on integrated projects. This included a sum of Rs. 432 million spent on the construction of a warehouse complex at Peliyagoda. Meanwhile, a sum of Rs. 97 million was spent on the projects undertaken on behalf of the clients. A further sum of Rs. 91 million was incurred on the purchase of under developed or unutilised land by the land bank of the UDA.

ROADS AND RAIL TRACKS

During the year under review, Road Development Authority (RDA) and provincial councils maintained a road network of approximately 23,900 kilometers. Of the total road network, 46 per cent or 10,960 kilometers were maintained by the RDA. The RDA spent a sum of Rs. 2,556 million on construction, improvement and rehabilitation of roads and Rs. 181 million on maintenance during 1993.

71

During the year under review, the activities of the RDA centered mainly around the rehabilita­tion and improvement of existing road network. The rehabilitation work of 145 kms. from Avissawella to Hatton and Homagama to Ratnapura continued under the Road Improvement Project funded by the Asian Development Bank. In addition, activities relating to rehabilitation of 175 kms under the IDA funded Third Road Project also continued during the year. Meanwhile, the construction work on improving Waskaduwa-Bandaragama-Kesbewa road to provide an alternative to the existing Galle road from Kalutara to Colombo and Sri Jayawardanapura continued in 1993. The Rehabilitation work of Peliyagoda-Katunayake section of Peliyagoda-Puttalam road was com­menced in 1993 at an estimated cost of Rs. 330 million. The work on the repairs to new Kelani Bridge was continued in 1993 at an estimated cost of Rs. 170 million.

During the year under review, the rail track kilometerage rose by 9 kms. to 1,953 kms. due to the commencement of a new branch line from Anuradhapura to Mihintale. Meanwhile, the broad gauging of the Kelani valley line from Nugegoda to Homagama was completed during the year.

COMMUNICATION SERVICES

In 1993, there was a marginal improvement in the activities related to postal services, while the telecommunication sector showed a moderate improvement in terms of capacity and services provided to the nation.

The number of articles handled by the Postal Department rose by 4 per cent to 486 million in 1993 from 469 million in 1992. This was largely due to increases in inland and foreign mail handling by 4 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively. Inland parcels handling marginally rose to 581,000 while foreign parcels handling remain unchanged at the previous year's level of 69,000. Meanwhile, in terms of capacity, the post office network expanded from 4,018 in 1992 to 4,042 in 1993. Accordingly, the area served by a post office reduced marginally to 16.2 square kilometers in 1993, reflecting increased availability and access to postal services to the general public. However, the average number of letters per inhabitant showed only a marginal increase from 27 to 28 between the two years partly reflecting the increased availability of speedier communication modes in the country.

With a view to expanding and upgrading the existing telecommunication network, the Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) undertook several development projects during 1993. The main development projects continued during the year were the contribution of capital to Global Commercial Commu­nication Satellite System, Improvement of Telecommunication net work in the Greater Colombo Area (Phase II), Network Development Project in Gampaha and Katunayake exchange area, Second Telecommunication Project with the component of International Switching Centre, Earth Station Trunk Transmission Network, Management Information System and Technical Assistance Project, South East Asian Middle East Western Europe Submarine Cable Project (SEA-ME-WE 2) and the Development of the Telecommunication Network in the Matara district.

In addition to these ongoing major development programmes, the SLT executed several in­terim projects on an accelerated basis, in order to meet the immediate demand for telecommunica­tion facilities. Accordingly, the Master Exchange at Nugegoda (8,000 lines), CSED (long distance switching unit) for Panadura (2000 lines) and CSED (long distance switching unit) for Marawila (1000 lines) were completed during the year under review. Also, under the "Colombo Crash Programme", the projects undertaken to improve the switching capacity at Havelock Town, Kotte, Ratmalana and Moratuwa were completed by the end of 1993. In addition, the "Mobitel" cellular mobile telephone system installed and operated on "Build, Operate and Transfer" (BOT) basis was able to provide approximately 4,000 telephones during the year. The areas covered under this new system were Colombo, area extending from Marawila to Aluthgama, Galle, Matara, Ratnapura,

Kandy, Kurunegala and Kuliyapitiya. Furthermore, with a view to improving the international communication facilities, measures were taken to establish the Public Switched Packet Data Net­work in Sri Lanka, while work on Transportable Earth Station Project which is designed for the augmentation of international circuits to ease congestion continued during the year 1993.

FoIIowing-these infrastructure developments, the telephone lines provided to public rose sig­nificantly by 22,270 to 157,774 in 1993. The number of new lines provided in the previous year was 10,607.- Consequently, the telephone density (telephones per 100 persons) rose from 0.78 to 0.93 between the two years. However, reflecting the inadequacy of the existing telecommunication network to keep pace with the accelerating demand for telephone facilities, the number of appli­cants in the waiting list increased by 27,859 to 124,066 by the end of 1993.

Meanwhile, the total number of telex connections rose by 3 per cent to 1,626 in 1993. The total overseas telephone traffic continued to increase by 3 per cent, while as in the previous year, overseas telegram traffic and overseas telex traffic further dropped by 11 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively during the year under review.

JANASAVIYA PROGRAMME

The Janasaviya Programme (JSP) conducted its third and fourth round activities during 1993. The third round of JSP which commenced in February, 1992 and is expected to complete in January, 1994, was in operation in 22 Divisional Secretary's (DS) divisions covering 101,000 families. A further 96,000 families have been benefitted under the JSP with the commencement of its fourth round activities in 25 DS divisions in March, 1993. The first two rounds of the JSP which completed its operations in 1991 and 1992 reached 223,460 families. Accordingly, 420,460 fami­lies have so far benefitted from the programme since its inception. The total expenditure on account of consumption support to the Janasaviya beneficiaries under the third and fourth rounds of the programme in 1993 amounted to Rs. 3,451 million. Since its inception up to end December 1993, the JSP has channeled a total sum of Rs. 13.6 billion for consumption support of the poor. Mean­while, during the year under review, 92,888 beneficiaries in the second round received capital entitlement certificates.

During the year under review, the JSP beneficiaries continued to receive credit facilities to undertake income generating activities. Under the third round, 50,982 families were granted credit facilities amounting to Rs. 243 million. The financial institutions involved in providing credit were the People's Bank, Bank of Ceylon, Co-operative Rural Banks and the Regional Rural Develop­ment Banks.

Meanwhile, the JSP efforts have also helped to increase the living standards of the poor through the creation of new employment opportunities. The first two rounds of the JSP provided employment opportunities to 159,224 families while the third round provided such opportunities to 38,235 families. These employment opportunities have been created in the agriculture, fisheries, manufacturing industries, trade and commerce sectors.

In 1993, the Janasaviya Trust Fund (JTF) continued its activities under four main projects -Community Projects, Credit Projects, Human Resource Development Projects and Nutrition Projects - with a view to alleviating poverty in targetted communities. Under the Community Projects, 789 rural infrastructural projects were initiated and a sum of Rs. 121 million was spent in rehabilitating, upgrading and creating rural infrastructure projects. In addition, the JTF provided credit facilities valued at Rs. 88 million to 14,878 micro projects in the fields of agriculture, small industries and livestock enterprises through partner organizations. A sum of Rs. 70 million was spent under the Human Resource Development Projects which envisaged the gradual emancipation of the poor with awareness building, skill development and community mobilisation. Expenditure incurred on the Nutritional Projects which are directed towards uplifting the nutritional status of pregnant mothers and children was Rs. 18 million in 1993.

HEALTH

The total expenditure on health services increased by 8 per cent to Rs. 7,064 million in 1993 from Rs. 6,541 million in 1992. In relative terms, its share in the GDP decreased marginally from 1.5 per cent in 1992 to 1.4 per cent in 1993. Current expenditure on health rose by 26 per cent to Rs. 5,711 million, while capital expenditure in the sector declined by 33 per cent to Rs. 1,353 million between the two years.

During 1993, the major thrust of the national health policy was centered around health promo­tion, prevention and control of diseases, strengthening the quality and range of existing services and decentralization of health administration. With a view to implementing the policies identified in the National Health Policy, a national steering committee was set up in January, 1993. This committee intum appointed several sub committees to ensure the implementation of short term policy measures identified and prioritized in selected areas. In addition, measures were taken to formulate a Master Plan for Health Development up to year 2000. Meanwhile, the task force on mobilization of financial resources to the health sector examined the possibility of introducing paying beds and paying outpatient sections in government hospitals and developing Health Insurance Schemes.

Investment on health infrastructure further expanded during 1993. Under the Health and Family Planning Project assisted by the World Bank/IDA, activities relating to the construction of divisional drug stores, Gramodaya Health Centres and workshops were continued. The project on development of the Colombo General Hospital (Phase II), funded by FINNIDA consisting of laying a direct water supply line from Maligawatte to the General Hospital Colombo (GHC), laying of a circular supply line along the perimeter of the GHC, construction of six two storey ward blocks and rehabilitation of the sewerage system of the GHC were implemented during the year under review. The new workshop and warehouse complex of the Bio Medical Engineering services division, constructed with the assistance of the Government of Japan was opened in June, 1993. Meanwhile,

initial discussions have taken place for the preparation of preliminary plans to construct a ten storey block at Lady Ridgeway Hospital with the assistance of the Chinese government.

With a view to facilitating patient care and primary health care services, 3,213 health person­nel were recruited during the first nine months of the year under review. This included 531 intern medical officers. 534 post intern medical officers, 802 nurses, 553 public health midwives, 572 attendants and 221 other workers. However, the acute shortage of specialist medical officers con­tinued to be the major constraint for the provision of a satisfactory patient care service to the nation.

The activities relating to community health services consisting of control of communicable diseases, improvement in sanitation, epidemiological surveillance, promotion of family health, etc. further expanded during 1993. Between 1992 and 1993, there was a decline in incidence of Japa­nese Encepalities, Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever and other vaccine preventiable diseases such as Diphtheria. Tetanus and Measles. In the meantime, activities relating to Malaria Control Campaign were strengthened by the adoption of a new global malaria control strategy since mid 1993. However, there was only a minor reduction in the total incidence of Malaria and a high incidence was recorded in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Moneragala, Puttalam and Matale. Surveillance activi­ties against Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) have been intensified by the decentralisation of such activities to the periphery.

EDUCATION

The government spent Rs. 14 billion or 10 percent of its total expenditure on education in 1993. This was an increase of 12 per cent over the amount spent in the previous year. However, educational expenditure in relation to GDP declined marginally from 2.9 per cent in 1992 to 2.8 per cent in 1993. During the year under review, capital expenditure on education at Rs. 2,845 million rose significantly by 42 per cent, largely due to increased investments on school development projects. Current expenditure on education also increased by 6 per cent to Rs. 11,211 million in 1993. This included a sum of Rs. 2,453 million incurred on the provision of mid-day meal, school text books, school season tickets and free school uniforms. A total of 4.3 million school children in 10,706 schools benefitted from these programmes.

In 1993, the total number of schools increased to 10,706 from 10,588 in 1992. The student population in schools also rose from 4,286,275 in 1992 to 4,302,778 in 1993. Accordingly, the number of students per school decreased from 405 in 1992 to 402 in 1993. Meanwhile, during the first 9 months of the year under review, 9,405 teachers have been recruited to the education service thereby increasing the total number of teachers to 194,039. Consequently, the pupil teacher ratio further improved to 22 in 1993 from 24 in 1992.

With a view to providing equal educational opportunities in rural areas, several projects were undertaken to expand and upgrade the educational infrastructure. Accordingly, the government aimed at establishing at least one school with all facilities in every electoral district under the National School Development Project. Under this project, the number of national schools has been increased to 90 in 1993 from 39 in 1992. Another 153 schools have been identified to be developed up to the national school level. Also, placing more emphasis on developing educational infrastruc­ture in rural areas, several foreign funded projects, namely the Education Development Project, General Education Project, Primary School Development Project, Plantation School Education Development Project and German Technical Co-operation Project were geared during the year under review.

With respect to the University education, the academic year 1991/92 which was delayed due to the closure of universities for two years, commenced in the year 1993. During the year under review 8,900 students were newly admitted to the Universities, while a total of 6,056 graduated. The new enrollment of students to the faculties of Arts, Commerce and Management studies amounted to 4,222, while students intake for the Science, Engineering and Medical faculties was

76

3,745. By the end of 1993, there were 30,846 students in the nine main universities. However, the academic staff strength of the 9 Universities increased marginally to 2,090 in 1993 from 2,040 in 1992. Consequently, the student teacher ratio improved marginally to 15 in 1993. Meanwhile, a total of 8,625 students were newly admitted to the Open University in 1993, thereby raising the total students in the Open University to 17,396 by the end of 1993. The total staff strength in the Open Universities increased to 355 in 1993 from 338 in 1992.

MAHAWELI PROGRAMME1

The total expenditure incurred under the Mahaweli Programme in 1993 amounted to Rs.2,642 million or 95 per cent of the budgetary allocation for the year. Of the total expenditure, 48 per cent or Rs.l,266 million was spent on the systems development activities: System "B" (Rs.545 million), System "C" (Rs.570 million), System "H" (Rs.7 million) and System "L" (Rs.144 million). In 1993 the System "G" was incorporated into System "B".

Total amount of power generated by five hydro power plants coming under the Mahaweli Project recorded a substantial increase of 22 per cent in 1993 to 1,905 gigawatt hours (g.Wh.) due to favourable weather conditions experienced in the hydro catchment areas. Meanwhile, as in the previous year no power was generated by the Bowatenna power plant in 1993. All the other power plants except Kotmale showed improved performance during 1993. Power generated at Randenigala which declined by 30 per cent in the previous year recorded a significant increase of 87 per cent to 361 g.Wh. in 1993. The power generated at Rantambe, Victoria and Ukuwela too rose by 49 per cent, 24 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, to 188 g.Wh., 731 g.Wh. and

178 g.Wh., respectively. In contrast, power generated at Kotmale which increased by 38 per cent in the previous year decreased by 7 per cent to 448 g.Wh. in 1993. The total power generated by the power plants of the Mahaweli Programme in 1993 accounted for 47 per cent of the national power supply as against 44 per cent in the previous year.

The extent cultivated under the Mahaweli Command Area which declined by 15 per cent during 1992 recorded a 22 per cent increase to 123,055 hectares during 1993. The extent cultivated during the Maha 1992/93 season rose by 9 per cent to 75,011 hectares when compared to the previous Maha season. Meanwhile, the extent cultivated during Yala which declined by 37 per cent, in 1992 recorded a significant increase of 52 per cent to 48,044 hectares in 1993.

The total extent under paddy in the Mahaweli Command Area which decreased by 8 per cent in 1992 recorded a 14 per cent increase to 102,346 hectares during 1993. The extent under other crops which declined by 48 per cent in the previous year recorded a 96 per cent improvement to reach 20,709 hectares during 1993.

The total number of families settled under the Mahaweli Programme in 1993 was 4,523. Of this, 71 per cent or 3,190 families were settled in System "B", while 1,050 and 283 families were settled in Systems "C" and "H", respectively. The cumulative number of families settled under the Mahaweli Programme as at end of 1993 was 88,917 families.
