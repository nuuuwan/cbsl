Reflecting a similar trend, the Broad Money Supply (M 2) recorded an annual increase of 23.5 per cent compared with 16.6 per cent in the previous year. The acceleration in monetary growth was more marked during the second half of the year. The annual growth in M,, which moved in a down\u00adward trend from 15.1 per cent to 11.6 per cent during January-June 1993, picked up thereafter to reach 19 per cent in December, 1993. Meanwhile, the annual growth of M 2, which declined from 20.5 per cent to 18.6 per cent between March and June 1993, accelerated during the subsequent months to reach 23.5 per cent at the end of the year.",

    "text": "The high monetary growth was caused mainly by a large increase in foreign.assets during 1993. This was evident in a spectacular rise of 87.9 per cent in net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking system from Rs.24,162 million in 1992 to Rs.45,400 million in 1993. A moderation in the growth of domestic credit, which rose by only 3.5 per cent in spite of a large increase in credit to the private sector by 21 per cent, eased the pressure on monetary aggregates. This moderation in domestic credit expansion was brought about by successful open market operations which resulted in a sharp reduction in net credit to the Government.",

In the previous year reserve money registered a comparatively modest growth of 12.0 per cent (Rs.4,802 million). On the source side, NFA of the Central Bank, which increased by Rs.24,676 million was the main contributory factor to the sharp rise in reserve money. However, a reduction in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the Central Bank by Rs.l3,067 million, largely in response to aggressive open market operations, helped to contain the reserve money growth to Rs.l 1,609 million. The money multiplier - the ratio between money supply and the monetary base - declined from 2.91 in December, 1992 to 2.86 in December, 1993. The imposition of a high statutory reserve requirement on commercial bank deposits was conducive to lowering the money multiplier in 1993.",

    "text": "Persistently high monetary growth throughout the year compelled the Central Bank to tighten its monetary policy stance during 1993. Pursuant to this policy, statutory reserve ratios on Rupee deposit as well as foreign currency deposit liabilities of commercial banks were raised on several occasions. With a view to further strengthening the effectiveness of this instrument, reserve ratios on all deposit liabilities were unified at 15 per cent with effect from August, 1993. Moreover, moral suasion was applied on commercial banks to moderate the growth of credit to private sector which remained high at 30 per cent in the middle of the year. In the context of a large influx of foreign funds, the Central Bank also intensified its open market operations through sales of Treasury bills and Central Bank securities with a view to sterilising excess liquidity in the economy. In addition to these policies, the Central Bank applied restraints on refinance credit to contain reserve money growth during 1993. As a consequence of these actions to contain liquidity growth, short term interest rates remained high throughout the year.",

The high positive real rates of interest offered on time and savings deposits, further intensification of deposit mobili\u00adsation efforts by commercial banks and continued liquidity injections through the accumulation of net foreign assets were conducive to the high growth in time and savings deposits with commercial banks during 1993. Thus, the Broad Money Supply (M2) consisting of M, plus time and savings deposits held by the public expanded by 23.5 per cent (Rs.30,661 million) in 1993.

The large increase in foreign liabilities was reflected mainly in the foreign currency deposit liabilities on account of Non-Resident Foreign Currency Accounts (NRFC) which grew by 29.5 per cent (Rs.5,322 million) in 1993. The increase in deposit liabilities in the previous year was 37 per cent (Rs.4,902 million). These developments in the relative position of foreign assets and liabilities of commercial banks reflected an increased foreign currency exposure in commercial banks.",

The expansion in liquid assets was mainly reflected in investments in Treasury bills and trade bills. Meanwhile, on the liabilities side, demand deposits rose by Rs.2,501 million. Following these developments, the ratio of liquid assets to demand deposits, which moved up from 160 per cent in 1991 to 167 per cent in 1992 rose further to 191 per cent in 1993 reflecting enhanced liquidity conditions in commercial banks. However, the ratio of liquid assets to total deposits remained unchanged at 40 per cent during the year.",

Accordingly, both the primary and secondary markets were used to reduce Treasury bills from the Central Bank's portfolio and absorb liquidity from the economy.

The average yield on three-months bills rose from 17.7 per cent per annum in December, 1992 to 20.84 per cent per annum in September, 1993 before declining to 18.09 per cent per annum in December, 1993. Similarly, the average yield on one year Treasury bills rose from 19 per cent to 21.98 per cent and declined to 19.38 per cent by the end of the year. In response to high yields on Treasury bills, market participation in the Treasury bills market remained high during 1993. Thus, the Treasury bill holdings of the non-banking sector rose by Rs.20,102 million during the year. Conversely, despite fresh issues of Treasury bills which raised the outstanding stock of Treasury bills from Rs.87,095 million to Rs.97,195 million during the year, holdings of Treasury bills by the Central Bank dipped from Rs.21,795 million in 1992 to Rs,3,949 million in 1993.",

This facilitated the emergence of a market determined yield on Treasury bills. The Central Bank also held regular meetings with primary dealers to promote a better dialogue and transparency in the operations of the Treasury bill market. The introduction of a repurchase market for Treasury bills in October, 1993 was helpful in the development of the short-end of the Treasury bill market, which in turn helped the management of liquidity on a daily basis.",

Similarly, the yields on Treasury bills with maturities of 6 months and 12 months moved-up from 18.05 per cent and 19.00 per cent, respectively at the end of 1992 to 21.06 per cent and 21.98 per cent, respec\u00adtively at the end of September, 1993. Following a similar trend, the discount and the re-discount yield on 3 months Treasury bills in the secondary market increased from 17.26 per cent and 18.85 per cent at the end of 1992 to 20.13 per cent and 21.64 per cent, respectively by the end of September, 1993. However, yields on Treasury bills in both primary and secondary market moved', in a downward direction towards the latter part of the year due to high liquidity conditions prevail\u00ading during that period. In the primary market, yield on three months bills declined to 18.09 per cerft by the end of the year. Similarly, yield on one year Treasury bills also dropped to 19.38 per cent.",

The growth in deposits of the bank was mainly reflected in fixed deposits which grew by 25 per cent (Rs.5,131 million) to Rs.25,736 million, due to high interest rates on such deposits in 1993. Meanwhile, savings deposits increased by 33 per cent (Rs.4,148 million) during 1993. With the decline in Treasury bill yield rates, interest rate paid on deposits with one year maturity was reduced from 17.0 per cent per annum to 16.0 per cent per annum in December, 1993. However, interest offered on savings deposits remained unchanged at 14.0 per cent per annum. Interest rates in respect of other term deposits were also reduced depending on the period of maturity.",

The turnover in the inter-bank call money market increased by 81 per cent (Rs.167,825 million) during the year. The upward revision of the Statutory Reserve Ratio on several occasions resulted in a higher demand for call money during 1993. Accordingly, the call money market rates, which declined from a range of 10-32 per cent in January, 1993 to a range of 3-20 per cent in March, 1993, increased to 15-35 per cent in May 1993. With the introduction of the repurchase market for Treasury bills in October, 1993, call money rates stabilised within a narrower range of 14 - 23 per cent. However, with the temporary concentration of liquidity within few banks due to over subscriptions to primary share issues, call market rates declined to a lower range of 8.0 - 18.5 per cent in November, 1993. The rates picked up again to reach a range of 16.5 - 28.0 per cent by the end of 1993.",

Meanwhile, Treasury bills amounting to Rs.3.5 billion were retired during the year. Accord\u00adingly, the total Treasury bills outstanding rose from Rs.87.1 billion at the end of 1992 to Rs.97.2 billion at the end of 1993. Reflecting a significant success in Open Market Operations, Treasury bills held by the Central Bank declined from Rs.21.8 billion in 1992 to Rs.3.9 billion in 1993. Induced by attractive yields, the non-bank private sector holdings of Treasury bills expanded from Rs.43.6 billion in 1992 to Rs.63.7 billion in 1993. The National Savings Bank, which raised its investments in Treasury bills to Rs.20.1 billion in 1993 from Rs.14.1 billion in 1992, was the major investor in Treasury bills from the non-bank sector. The Treasury bills purchased by commercial banks in the primary market increased from Rs.22.8 billion in 1992 to Rs.49.6 billion in 1993. However, reflecting active sales to the public, Treasury bill holdings of commercial banks increased from Rs.10.6 billion to only Rs.14.3 billion during the year.",

The growth in total assets of UTs was mainly reflected in the Ceybank Unit Trust and the National Equity Fund which accounted for 70 per cent of the total assets of UTs. The impressive growth trend in the share market was conducive to a continuous growth in UTs during the year. Consequently, the share of investments in equities in total assets rose from 37 per cent at the end of 1992 to 64 per cent at the end of 1993. The declining trend in returns on short-term money market instruments, particularly towards the end of the year, and the bullish mn in the share market induced UTs to play an active role in the share market during the year.",
