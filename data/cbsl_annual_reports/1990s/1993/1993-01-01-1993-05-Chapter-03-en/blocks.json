There was significant recovery in the output of tea, sugar and paddy sub sectors which recorded 30 per cent, 15 per cent and 10 per cent increases, respectively. Rubber production rose by 2 per cent over the previous year. In contrast, coconut production dropped by 6 per cent owing to the lagged effect of the drought that prevailed in 1992. Of the minor food crops, blackgram, chillies, potatoes, maize, big onions and ground nuts recorded improved performance. The output of most minor export crops also increased in 1993.",

The output of low grown teas which declined by 27 per cent to 87 million kgs. in 1992 increased by 28 per cent to 112 million kgs. in 1993. The output of high and medium grown teas, also rose by 35 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively to record 73 million kgs. and 47 million kgs., respectively. Meanwhile, the CTC (cut, tear and cur!) tea production expanded by 52 per cent to 7.9 million kgs. in 1993. However, the share of CTC tea in total production has remained unchanged around 3 per cent since 1991.",

The infilling subsidy scheme which was suspended in 1991 was re-introduced in 1993 fo, ^roup infilling of mature tea lands. Meanwhile, disbursements under the Tea Factory Development Subsidy Scheme declined by 46 per cent to Rs.45 million in 1993. This was largely due to the liquidity problems faced by factory owners consequent on high cost of production that caused them to postpone factor)' development activities. In fact nearly 60 tea factories terminated their operations owing to liquidity problems during the year.",
