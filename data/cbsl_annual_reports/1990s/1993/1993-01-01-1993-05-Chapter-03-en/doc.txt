OVERALL TRENDS

The agricultural sector recovered strongly in 1993, largely owing to the favourable weather conditions during the year. There was significant recovery in the output of tea, sugar and paddy sub sectors which recorded 30 per cent, 15 per cent and 10 per cent increases, respectively. Rubber production rose by 2 per cent over the previous year. In contrast, coconut production dropped by 6 per cent owing to the lagged effect of the drought that prevailed in 1992. Of the minor food crops, blackgram, chillies, potatoes, maize, big onions and ground nuts recorded improved performance. The output of most minor export crops also increased in 1993.

MAJOR EXPORT CROPS

Tea

Tea production which suffered a severe setback in 1992 recovered remarkably to reach a level of 232 million kgs. in 1993, an increase of 30 per cent over the production of the previous year. The favourable weather conditions as well as the increased use of fertilizer contributed to improved performance in all three elevational categories. The output of low grown teas which declined by 27 per cent to 87 million kgs. in 1992 increased by 28 per cent to 112 million kgs. in 1993. The output of high and medium grown teas, also rose by 35 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively to record 73 million kgs. and 47 million kgs., respectively. Meanwhile, the CTC (cut, tear and cur!) tea production expanded by 52 per cent to 7.9 million kgs. in 1993. However, the share of CTC tea in total production has remained unchanged around 3 per cent since 1991.

Fertilizer usage in the tea sector which has been declining since 1990 recovered significantly by 27 per ce^t from 110,200 metric tons in 1992 to 140,500 metric tons in 1993. Favourable weather conditions that prevailed during the year as well as the improved management of the majority of the former Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) and Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) estates by the private management companies appear to have contributed to the increase in the fertilizer application during 1993.

The requirement that owners of tea lands have to register their holdings with the Tea Commis­sioner has been dispensed with since January 1993. In future the updating of extent under tea will be effected through periodical surveys. The total extent replanted during the year decreased by 7 per cent to 1,311 hectares, while the extent under new planting expanded by 17 per cent to 1,619 hectares in 1993.

The subsidy rates for new planting in the three elevational categories were increased from Rs.30,000 to Rs.36,000 per hectare in 1993. Meanwhile, the replanting subsidy in the low elevational areas was increased by 39 per cent from Rs.41,000 to Rs.57,000, while the subsidy for the high and medium elevational categories was increased by 40 per cent, from Rs.48,000 to Rs.67,000 per hectare. The total subsidies disbursed by the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority (TSHDA) during the year for new planting increased by 56 per cent to Rs.50 million, while subsidies for replanting decreased by 26 per cent to Rs.29 million. The infilling subsidy scheme which was suspended in 1991 was re-introduced in 1993 fo, ^roup infilling of mature tea lands. Meanwhile, disbursements under the Tea Factory Development Subsidy Scheme declined by 46 per cent to Rs.45 million in 1993. This was largely due to the liquidity problems faced by factory owners consequent on high cost of production that caused them to postpone factor)' development activities. In fact nearly 60 tea factories terminated their operations owing to liquidity problems during the year.

Sri Lanka Tea Board continued to operate the subsidy scheme introduced in 1992 for factory modernisation for the production of CTC teas where 70 per cent of the cost of machinery is subsidised. Under this scheme, Rs.l34 million has been disbursed among 12 factories during the year. Meanwhile, as the progress achieved under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded Tea Small Holder Development Project was not adequate, several corrective measures were undertaken during the year in collaboration with the Rural Credit Department of the Central Bank, which included conducting of seminars, training of bank managers and simplificaion of loan procedures.

The average cost of production (COP) of made tea in 1993 has been estimated at Rs.75.81 per kg, an increase of 5 per cent over the COP of the previous year.

The average gross price of all teas at the Colombo Auctions which rose by 6 per cent in the previous year, recorded a further 12 per cent improvement from Rs.61.75 per kg. in 1992 to Rs.68.88 per kg. in 1993. The average export (f.o.b.) price also increased by 11 per cent from Rs.81.98 per kg. in 1992 to Rs.91.16 per kg. in 1993.

The tea cess remained unchanged at Rs.2.00 per kg. during 1993. The total cess collected during the year increased by 33 per cent to Rs.446 million, compared to Rs.335 million in the previous year.

Rubber

Rubber production is provisionally estimated at 108 million kgs. in 1993. This reflected a 2 per cent growth over the previous year which was brought about by both the increases in the tapping extent and average yield realised during the year.

The output of all grades of rubber, except sheet rubber and scrap crepe increased in 1993. The output of technically specified rubber rose by 4 per cent to 16 million kgs. while that of latex crepe increased by 5 per cent to 26' million kgs. Sole crepe rubber recorded a rise of 11 per cent to 4 million kgs. Sheet rubber which accounted for about 44 per cent of the total output decreased marginally by 1 per cent to 45 million kgs., while the output of scrap crepe decreased by 8 per cent to 5 million kgs.

The total quantity of fertilizer used in the rubber sector increased by 3,802 metric tons or 29 per cent to 16,908 metric tons in 1993.

The total extent registered under rubber increased marginally by 300 hectares to 194,900 hectares in 1993, while the extent under tapping rose by 2 per cent to 148,900 hectares. Meanwhile, the average yield recorded an increase from 725 kgs. per hectare in 1992 to 730 kgs. per hectare in 1993.

With the abolition of export duty in December 1992, there was a general increase of prices in RSS1 and RSS2. The average price of RSS1 at the Colombo Auctions rose by 21 per cent to Rs.35.48 per kg., while the average price of RSS2 increased by 9 per cent to Rs.31.57 per kg. in 1993. The average export (f.o.b.) price of all grades of rubber recorded an increase of 27 per cent, from Rs.37.65 per kg. in 1992 to Rs.44.34per kg. in 1993.

According to the Rubber Control Department, the cost of production of rubber in the private sector including smallholdings is provisonally estimated to have increased by 12 per cent, from Rs.20.50per kg. in 1992 to Rs.23.00 per kg. in 1993.

The domestic consumption of rubber recorded an increase of 11 per cent to 32 million kgs. in 1993, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of the total production during the year. A significant improvement in the activities of the rubber based manufacturing sector was the major contributory factor for the higher level of local consumption of rubber during the year.

Coconut

Coconut production declined by 6 per cent to 2,164 million nuts in 1993 when compared with the level of production in the previous year. The decline in production could be attributed to the lagged effect of the severe drought that prevailed during 1992. The shortfall in nut production led to the importation of 29,000 metric tons of coconut oil and 900 metric tons of copra during the year.

The nut equivalent of desiccated coconut (DC) production dropped substantially by 26 per cent from 365 million nuts in 1992 to 269 million nuts in 1993 and coconut oil production declined by 27 per cent to 176 million nuts. The nut equivalent of copra exports and fresh nut exports too dropped by 17 per cent and 12 per cent to 24 million and 22 million nuts, respectively. In contrast, the domestic nut consumption has been estimated to have increased by 2 per cent to 1,668 million nuts in 1993.

Planting activities carried out under various subsidy schemes experienced a set back in 1993 for the third consecutive year. The extent of coconut land rehabilitated which declined by 6 per cent in 1992 suffered a further set back in 1993 with the extent rehabilitated declining by 21 per cent to 2,259 hectares in 1993.

The extent newly planted with coconut which declined by 37 per cent to 637 hectares in the previous year decreased by a further 29 per cent to 452 hectares in 1993, for the fourth consecutive year. The extent under-planted and replanted which declined by 23 per cent to 1,590 hectares in the previous year also recorded a further drop of 2 per cent to 1,553 hectares in 1993. The drop in the under-planted and replanted extents was recorded for the third consecutive year.

The extent of coconut land inter-cropped during the year with pasture declined by 32 per cent to 25 hectares. Meanwhile, the extent inter-cropped with other crops showed a significant increase to 165 hectares from 40 hectares in the previous year.

Fertilizer usage in the coconut sector declined by 1 per cent to 33,700 metric tons in 1993 over 1992. Fertilizer issues by the fertilizer stores of the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) dropped by 9 per cent to 1,704 metric tons in 1993. The number of nurseries maintained by the CCB in 1993 rose to 29 from 27 in the previous year and this resulted in an increase in the seedlings issued during the year by 7 per cent to 1.72 million.

The average wholesale price of fresh coconuts in the Colombo Market continued to display an increasing trend with a 10 per cent rise over the previous year to Rs.4.69 per nut in 1993. However, the average export (f.o.b.) price of the three major kernel products which increased by 34 per cent in the previous year declined by 2 per cent to Rs.6.31 per nut in 1993. Meanwhile, the average cost

Under the DC Mill Development Programme a sum of Rs.7 million was disbursed among twenty seven millers during the year. The Stabilization Fund for Coconut provided a loan of Rs.27 million in 1993 to the Coconut Development Authority (CDA) to disburse among 40 DC millers as a subsidised loan to enable them to pay relief wages to DC workers during the closure of DC mills following the shortage of nut production.

The Agricultural Insurance Board in collaboration with the Coconut Cultivation Board initi­ated an insurance scheme for new planting of coconut during 1993. This scheme was implemented in the Kurunegala, Puttalam, Kegalle and Gampaha districts and during the year where over 400 hectares were insured.

OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

Minor Export Crops

Minor export crops comprise a wide range of perennial crops other than tea, rubber and coconut. These crops are mainly grown as mixed crops in home gardens and in small-holdings which makes it difficult to obtain reliable data on their production. Hence, data on export volumes of these crops are used as a proxy to monitor their production performance assuming that the changes in local consumption and stock changes of these products are not significant.

On the basis of export data, the performance of the minor export crop sector was rather mixed but, on the whole, better than in the previous year. Substantial increases in the export volume of pepper, cocoa, cloves and cinnamon indicated that the production of these crops moved up signifi­cantly in 1993. The volume of pepper exports rose three-fold to 7,939 metric tons in 1993 and there was a similar increase in the volume of cocoa to 53 metric tons. The export volume of cloves and cinnamon at 1,688 metric tons and 8,755 metric tons showed increases of 51 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. In contrast, the coffee (39 per cent), cardamom (30 per cent) and nutmeg (4 per cent) reported marked decreases in export volume.

Fertilizer usage in the minor export crop sector which decreased by 36 per cent in 1992 recorded a further decrease of 1 per cent to 7,000 metric tons in 1993. During the year, the Department of Export Agriculture issued 1,240 metric tons of fertilizer for selected crops, viz. pepper, coffee, cocoa and cinnamon under the Fertilizer Block Demonstration Programme.

According to the data provided by the Department of Export Agriculture, the extent under important minor export crops rose by 1 per cent to 67,494 hectares during 1993. This is mainly explained by the extent under pepper which showed a further increase by 5 per cent to 11,027 hectares in 1993. The performance of replanting and new planting activities of minor export crops was mixed in 1993. The total extent replanted with cinnamon in 1993 at 55 hectares recorded a 35 per cent increase, while that of cardamom declined by 30 per cent to 11 hectares in 1993. However, the total extent newly planted decreased by 5 per cent to 641 hectares in 1993. The extent rehabili­tated in respect of cinnamon and cocoa recorded a decrease of 63 per cent, from 912 hectares in

1992 to 339 hectares in 1993 under the Export Agriculture Crop (EAC) Assistance Scheme.

The Mid Country Perennial Crops Development Project (PERCRODEP) which was initiated in 1989 with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank in the districts of Kegalle, Kandy, Matale, Badulla and Monaragala continued its operations in 1993. This project intends to promote commercial production and improve marketing facilities of perennial crops which include most of the minor export crops namely, pepper, cocoa, coffee, cinnamon and fruits.

Domestic Agriculture

Paddy

Paddy production estimated at 2.56 million metric tons (122.9 million bushels of paddy) in 1993 was an increase of 9.6 per cent over the production of the previous year and the highest recorded for the last six years. However, this was 4 per cent less than the peak production of 2.66 million metric tons recorded in 1985. Increased production during both Maha 1992/93 and Yala 1993 brought about by increased extent harvested as well as the improvement in yields during both seasons on account of favourable weather conditiosns that prevailed during the year contributed to the improved performance in 1993.

(e) Maha paddy harvest is purchased during the period from January to July, while Yala harvest is purchased during the period from August to December.

Paddy production in Maha 1992/93 estimated at 1.69 million metric tons (81 million bushels) was 4 per cent higher than the output of the previous Maha season. A marginal increase in the average yield as well as an expansion in the extent harvested contributed to the improved perfor­mance during the Maha season. For the sixth consecutive year, Kurunegala District recorded the highest production which amounted to 234,460 metric tons, accounting for nearly 14 per cent of total production during the Maha season.

Paddy production in Yala 1993 increased significantly by 23 per cent to record 0.87 million metric tons (42 million bushels) when compared with the production of the previous Yala season. Increased extent sown and harvested as well as an improvement in the yield contributed to the enhanced paddy production during the Yala season.

The annual average yield per hectare in 1993 rose by 2 per cent to 3,502 kgs. over the previous year. The average yield during the Maha 1992/93 increased marginally to 3,516 kgs. per hectare. The average yield which grew by 7 per cent during the 1992 Yala season recorded a further 7 per cent increase in Yala 1993 to 3,465 kgs. per hectare. This was the highest yield recorded during a Yala season since 1983. The Mahaweli 'H' area recorded the highest average yield of 5,177 kgs. per hectare during the Maha season. For the eighth consecutive year, Uda Walawe area recorded the highest average yield of 4,777 kgs. per hectare during Yala 1993.

The average yield of major and minor irrigated areas during the Maha 1992/93 season increased by 1 per cent-and 3 per cent, respectively. In contrast, the average yield of rainfed areas during the season declined by 4 per cent. The average yield of the major irrigated areas during Yala 1993 rose significantly jby 17 per cent to 4,215 kgs. while, the average yields of minor irrigated and rainfed areas dropped by 3 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively.

The total gross extent sown with paddy increased by 4 per cent to 835,428 hectares in 1993 solely due to a 14 per cent expansion in the gross extent sown during the Yala 1993 season. The gross extent sown during Maha 1992/93 declined marginally to 545,689 hectares.

The total gross extent harvested which declined during the previous year recorded a 7 per cent increase during 1993. Increased extents harvested during both Maha and Yala seasons largely due to favourable weather conditions contributed to this improvement. The gross extent harvested during Maha 1992/93 increased by 3 per cent, while that of Yala rose by over 16 per cent in contrast to a 21 per cent decline in the previous Yala season. The degree of crop failure which was 5 per cent of the gross extent sown, in the Maha and Yala seasons of 1992 declined to 1 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively during Maha 1992/93 and Yala 1993.

Fertilizer usage in the paddy sector in 1993 rose by 2 per cent to 212,800 metric tons over the issues in the previous year. Meanwhile, paddy purchases by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) during 1993 were 45,900 metric tons compared to 7,000 metric tons in 1992. Paddy purchases in 1993 accounted for about 2 per cent of the total production. The guaranteed price of paddy (GPS) was increased from Rs. 136 to Rs. 155 per bushel in May 1993.

Credit granted to the paddy sector under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme which declined by 16 per cent in the previous year recorded a further decrease of 2 per cent to Rs.603 million in 1993. Loans granted to the paddy sector through the Agricultural Trust Fund (ATF) too declined by 42 per cent to Rs.29 million.

Rice imports during 1993 declined by 12 per cent to 208,806 metric tons following increased production. In the previous year, the imports amounted to 237,000 metric tons.

Sugar

Sugar production at 68,603 metric tons in 1993 was the highest ever production recorded so far and 15 per cent higher than the production in the previous year. The increased production at

44

Hingurana, Sevanagala and Pelwatte contributed to the improvement in output. The production at Hingurana rose by 35 per cent to 12,880 metric tons. The production at Sevanagala recorded an increase for the fourth consecutive year in 1993, when it rose by 17 per cent to 15,895 metric tons, while at Pelwatte output increased by 15 per cent to 39,462 metric tons over the previous year. In contrast, sugar production at Kantale declined sharply by 85 per cent to 366 metric tons. The decline in production at Kantale was due to the lack of irrigation water for the crop which resulted in the reduction in the availability of cane for crushing. As in the previous year, the Sevanagala factory accounted for 23 per cent of the total production, while the share of production at Pelwatte recorded a marginal increase Jo 58 per cent. The production at Kantale accounted for less than one per cent of the total production during the year.

Increased quantity of cane crushed as well as an improvement in the recovery rates contributed to the growth in production of sugar at Hingurana and Pelwatte. The production at Sevanagala improved inspite of a marginal decrease in the recovery rate, mainly on account of a 19 per cent increase in the quantity of cane crushed during the year. The poor performance at Kantale was the result of a 78 per cent decrease in the quantity of cane crushed and a reduction in the recovery rate. The total quantity of cane crushed by the four factories increased by 11 per cent to 809,733 metric tons in 1993. The quantity of cane crushed at Hingurana, Sevanagala and Pelwatte rose by 26 per cent, 19 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively to 175,564 metric tons, 175,134 metric tons and 451,346 metric tons, respectively.

Sugar recovery rates at Hingurana and Pelwatte improved over the rates in the previous year. The overall sugar recovery rate of the four factories during the year improved to 8.47 per cent from 8.17 per cent in the previous year. Inspite of a marginal decline compared to the previous year, the Sevanagala factory recorded the best recovery rate of 9.2 per cent for the fourth consecutive year.

The total extent under cane including the ratoonings managed by the four sugar companies declined by 9 per cent to 12,891 hectares. The area under cane at Kantale declined drastically-by 61 per cent to 862 hectares, while the extent at Sevanagala too dropped by 14 per cent to 3,259 hectares. However, the extent under cane at Hingurana increased by 14 per cent to 2,720 hectares, while at Pelwatte the extent expanded by 43 hectares to 6,050 hectares during the year.

The average yield of sugar cane maintained under the Kantale factory declined significantly by 35 per cent. Meanwhile, the average yield of sugar cane at Hingurana, Pelwatte and Sevanagala rose by 20 per cent, 9 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively resulting in an increase in the overall average yield of the four factories by 21 per cent to 59.1 metric tons per hectare in 1993.

The extent of sugar cane harvested at Hingurana, Sevanagala and Pelwatte increased by 21 per cent, 14 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. The extent harvested at Kantale declined by 66 per cent which resulted in a reduction of the total extent harvested marginally by 79 hectares to 10,452 hectares when compared with the previous year.

Inspite of a marginal decline in the extent harvested, the total quantity of cane harvested by the four factories increased by 21 per cent to 617,923 metric tons in 1993 when compared to the quantity harvested in 1992. The improvement in the total quantity harvested could be attributed to the improvement in the overall average yield. The quantity harvested at Hingurana, Pelwatte and Sevanagala improved by 45 per cent, 26 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively to 139,75.8 metric tons, 296,208 metric tons and 174,268 metric tons, respectively in 1993 over the previous year. In contrast, the quantity of cane harvested at Kantale declined by 78 per cent.

The quantity of cane supplied by the private cultivators which declined by 40 per cent in 1992 decreased by a further 12 per cent to 191,810 metric tons in 1993. The quantity of cane purchased by Hingurana and Pelwatte declined by 17 per cent and 11 per cent, to 35,806 metric tons and 1*55,138 metric tons, respectively.

Minor Food Crops

Majority of the minor food crops are cultivated in home gardens and in small scattered plots under rainfed conditions. The collection of reliable data on the extent and production of these crops is difficult and therefore the analysis of the performance of minor food crops is based on crude estimates.

According to data provided by the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Research, the production performance of minor food crops in 1993 was rather mixed. The minor food crops that recorded increases in production in 1993 were, blackgram (two-fold), chillies and potatoes (72 per cent each), maize (48 per cent), big onions (38 per cent) and ground nuts (26 per cent). The significant expansion in production could be attributed to increased extents and average yields under these crops.

Meanwhile, decreases were recorded in the production of gingelly (35 per cent), soya bean (12 per cent) and cowpea (7 per cent). The decline in the production of soya bean and cowpea was the combined result of a reduction in the extent cultivated and lower yields. Despite an increase in the extent under cultivation, the output of gingelly declined due to reduced average yield.

Fertilizer used on the minor food crops sector declined by 23 per cent to 38,200 metric tons in 1993 from 49,500 metric tons in 1992.

The floor price scheme operated by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) was in operation in respect of 8 selected minor food crops during 1993. The floor prices of maize, soya bean and green gram were increased to Rs.6.00, Rs.14.00 and Rs.20.00 in 1993 from Rs.5.25, Rs.7.30 and Rs.12.00 in 1992 respectively, while the other prices remained at the same level as in the previous year. Under this scheme, the purchase of maize rose fourteen-fold to 720 metric tons in 1993.

The purchase of green gram by the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) declined by 61 per cent, from 2,824 metric tons in 1992 to 1,095 metric tons in 1993, while the purchases of dried chillies recorded a four-fold increase to 94 metric tons. The import of dried chillies and big onions by the CWE decreased by 86 per cent to 1,000 metric tons and 30 per cent to 24,846 metric tons, respectively in 1993, due to the enhanced output.

FISH AND LIVESTOCK

The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has provisionally estimated fish production in 1993 at 220,900 metric tons, indicating an increase of 7 per cent when compared with the production in the previous year. This was mainly due to the improvement of the security situation in the Eastern province, the assistance and encouragement given by the Ministry for offshore and deep sea fisheries development by the provision of more multi-day boats and the substantial increases in subsidy payments under various subsidy schemes.

Fish production of the coastal fishery sub-sector which accounted for 77 per cent of the total fish production increased by 4 per cent, from 163,168 metric tons in 1992 to 169,900 metric tons in 1993. Production of the off-shore and deep sea sector rose by 50 per cent to 33,000 metric tons. In contrast, the fish production of the inland fishery sub-sector declined by 14 per cent to 18,000 metric tons.

As in the past, the private sector continued to dominate the fishery sector accounting for 99 per cent of the total fish production. The total fish supply of the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation (CFC) in 1993 estimated at 1,952 metric tons showed a 3 per cent increase over the supply of the previous year. Ice production of the CFC further decreased by 10 percent to 4,520 metric tons in 1993.

The functions in regard to the recovery of loans, insurance, operation of boats and mainte­nance work of the vessels belonging to three projects, viz. the North West Coast Fisheries Develop­ment Project, the West Coast Fisheries Development Project and the East Coast Fisheries Develop­ment Project continued in 1993.

The subsidy payments to the marine sector amounted to Rs.75 million in 1993 compared with Rs.61 million in 1992. Under various subsidy schemes, 811 boats and 188 traditional crafts were issued to the marine sector in 1993. Following the amalgamation of several of the Fisheries Co-operative Societies (FCSS) in the Eastern Province, the total number of societies has decreased by 5 per cent to 769. However, the total membership of the FCSS moved up from 83,627 in 1992 to 86,966 in 1993. Meanwhile, despite the increase in the level of production, the average prices of all varieties of fish rose during 1993.

According to tentative data provided by the Department of Census and Statistics, egg produc­tion remained unchanged at 812 million in 1993. Meanwhile, milk production (including buffalo milk) povisionally estimated in 1993 at 320 million litres indicated an increase of 1 per cent over the preceding year. The volume of milk collected by the Milk Industries of Lanka Company Limited (MILCO) was 45 million litres in 1993, registering a decrease of 7 per cent over 1992. In

contrast, milk collection of the Nestle Lanka Limited at 31 million litres was an increase of 19 per cent. The producer price of milk was raised from Rs.9.00 per litre to Rs.9.25 per litre with effect from 14th April, 1993.

According to tentative data provided by the Ceylon Grain Elevators Limited and the British Ceylon Corporation Lanka Limited, the combined animal feed production increased by 26 per cent or 46,046 metric tons to 225,693 metric tons in 1993.

FERTILIZER

According to tentative data provided by the National Fertilizer Secretariat, the total quantity of fertilizer used by different crop sectors in 1993 increased by 9 per cent to 518,000 metric tons, in contrast to a 4 per cent decrease reported during 1992. Fertilizer used in the paddy sector which accounted for the largest share of 41 per cent of total use in 1993 rose by 2 per cent while the usage on tea and rubber sectors increased by 27 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively during the period under review. In contrast, fertilizer used on coconut and minor export crops sectors dropped by 2 percent and 1 per cent, respectively.

The Ceylon Fertilizer Co. Ltd. which has been the main fertilizer importer in the past, continued to dominate fertilizer imports during 1993 as well, while annual fertilizer imports by other importers increased by 18 per cent to 435,226 metric tons in 1993. The import of Urea, which is the most popular fertilizer item, recorded an increase of 21 per cent to 158,841 metric tons in 1993. The import of Muriate of Potash and Sulphate of Ammonia also rose by 30 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, while the import of Rock Phosphate and Triple Super Phosphate decreased by 35 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively.

Fertilizer prices except the price of Sulphate of Ammonia remained unchanged throughout the year. The stock of fertilizer available with the wholesalers which stood at 92,818 metric tons at the beginning of the year increased to 94,912 metric tons by the end 1993.
