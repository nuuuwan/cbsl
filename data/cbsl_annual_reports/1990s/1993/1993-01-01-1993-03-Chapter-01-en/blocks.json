The balance of payments was in overall surplus for the fourth consecutive year and the country's foreign reserves have risen to a level sufficient to finance nearly 6 months of imports. Meanwhile, in March 1993, almost all exchange controls on current transactions (trade and service related) were removed and Sri Lanka became eligible to accept Article VIJJ obligations of the International Monetary Fund1. However, continuing domestic credit expansion and large capital inflows accelerated the pace of monetary growth and intensified demand pressure on domestic prices throughout the year.",

The increase in value added in the manufacturing sector, was an impressive 11 per cent in 1993. The factory industry sub-sector expanded by 11 per cent and contributed around four fifths of the total production of the entire sector. When the output of high value petroleum refined in the public sector is excluded, the bulk of this growth in factory industry has occurred in the private sector, demonstrating a dynamic response to recent economic reforms. The industrial categories that recorded strong performance in 1993 were textiles, apparel and leather products, chemical, petroleum and plastic products and non-metallic mineral products. The construction sector which recorded a growth of 8 per cent in 1992 continued to grow at 7 per cent in 1993 reflecting increasing capacity investment in the manufacturing sector as well as infrastructure investment in the public sector.",

Real wages improved by 4.1 per cent compared to 2.1 per cent in 1992. This increase in overall wages of workers in Wages Boards largely reflected the rise in wages of workers in agriculture (plantation workers have a weight of about 66 per cent in the overall index) whose wages increased sharply by 21.1 per cent in 1993 compared to 14.9 per cent in 1992. Workers in industry and commerce experienced a wage improvement of only 3.4 per cent in 1993, in contrast to a rise of 11.1 per cent in 1992. Given that the rate of inflation in 1993 was around 11.7 per cent, this represents a deterioration of real wages in this sector by 7.5 per cent. Nominal wages in the services sector remained stagnant in 1993. As a result, real wages for workers in this sector deteriorated by 10.6 per cent.",

This increase was entirely due to inflows of different types of private foreign capital, in part associated with the privatisation proceeds.",

Commen\u00adsurate with this growth, foreign direct investment to, enterprises under the BOI as well as in the form of investment in public enterprises that were privatised during the year, totalled SDR 134 million in 1993, in comparison to a total of SDR 86 million in the previous year - an increase of 56 per cent. Complementary to this, inflows on account of portfolio investment primarily in the stock exchange rose to SDR 48 million in 1993 from SDR 18 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, direct private long-term capital inflows also rose substantially. Also there were major inflows providing foreign financing towards Air Lanka's reflecting programme and the govern\u00adment-sponsored bus assembly projects and foreign loan capital towards on-lending by the develop\u00adment finance institutions and enterprises associated with the increase in foreign direct investment. The main outflows were on account of further payments by Air Lanka towards the purchase of aircrafts and repayment of previous loans to enterprises under the BOI. Reflecting these develop\u00adments, net inflow on account of private long term capital amounted to SDR 132 million.compared to a net inflow of SDR 18 million in the previous year.",

In addition to the improvement in the balance of payments items discussed thus far, a net inflow of SDR 38 million from transactions with the IMF contributed to this build up of reserves. The overall growth in external assets mainly reflected the growth in external assets of the Central Bank, which rose by 74 per cent to SDR 1,145 million. Gross official reserves comprising external assets held by the Central Bank and the Government increased from SDR 681 million to SDR 1,168 million and external assets of the commercial banks expanded from SDR 366 million to SDR 375 million.

From end-1992 to end-1993, the SLR has depreciated in nominal terms by 7.2 per cent against the US Dollar, the intervention currency. The movements against the other curren\u00adcies reflected the sum total of this change and fluctuations of the US Dollar against other currencies during the year. Thus, the overall impact was the nominal depreciation of the SLR from end-1992 to end-1993 against the Japanese Yen by 16.6 per cent, Pound Sterling by 5.5 per cent, French Franc by 0.9 per cent and the Deutsche Mark by 0.6 per cent. Consequently, the SLR had depreci\u00adated by 7.1 per cent against the SDR between the two years. Meanwhile, the SLR appreciated by 11.1 per cent against the Indian Rupee during the period under review, reflecting the impact of the major devaluation of the Indian Rupee in March, 1993.",

At the same time, the outstanding credit from the IMF since March consisted entirely of highly concessional assistance under the SAF and ESAF. Consequently, interest payments to the IMF also fell significantly. The decline in both interest and amortisation payments, combined with the increase in earnings from the export of goods and services and private transfers led to a sharp reduction in the debt service ratio from 17.1",

In spite of a slight weakening in the revenue effort which caused a decline in the revenue to GDP ratio from 20.2 per cent in 1992 to 19.8 per cent in 1993, the current account deficit of the budget declined from 0.9 per cent of GDP to 0.5 per cent of GDP due to a contraction in current outlays from 21.1 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 20.3 per cent of GDP in 1993. In contrast to the experience of the previous year, the government was able to maintain a high level of public investment, which rose to 8.0 per cent of GDP in 1993 from 7.3 per cent in 1992. Reflecting the combined effect of the moderate increase in current expenditure and enhanced growth in capital outlays, the total expenditure/GDP ratio was contained at 27.9 per cent in 1993. These developments were conducive to containing the overall budget deficit as planned at 8 per cent of GDP.",

Further tightening the policy stance, the SRR on Rupee deposits was raised to 15 per cent in May while the SRR on foreign currency time and savings deposits was raised to 9 per cent. At the same time, the SRR on foreign currency demand deposits was fixed at 11 per cent. In June, 1993, the SRR on foreign currency deposits was unified at 12 per cent while in August 1993, the reserve ratios on all deposits were unified at 15 per cent. These measures strengthened the effectiveness of the SRR as a policy instrument.

In the area of public enterprise reforms, a number of public enterprises were privatised. Budgetary transfers to commercial public enterprises were avoided with the additional funds generated from increases in electricity tariff and wheat and diesel prices. Considerable progress was also made in reducing public expenditure through a reduction in non-priority expenditure items and better targetting of major welfare pro\u00adgrammes. In the financial sector, new prudential capital adequacy guidelines for commercial banks were introduced with a view to improving the prudential and regulatory environment. The govern\u00adment also infused Rs.24 billion to the capital base of the two state banks in the form of interest bearing government bonds to re-capitalise these two banks. Further consolidating trade liberalisa\u00adtion, the government lowered import duties and eliminated export taxes. Moreover, the remaining licensing requirements on imports were eliminated except on a few selected items, which continued to be subjected to licensing on account of environment, health and security considerations. As a major step towards the convertibility of current international transactions, the requirement that export proceeds must be repatriated and forwarded to a Sri Lankan bank was removed in March, 1993 . At the same time most current or trade and service related transactions were exempted from exchange control. Thus, during the year Sri Lanka virtually removed all impediments towards accepting obligations under Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement. These measures were expected to build international and local confidence in Sri Lanka's economic policies, which will ultimately render exchange controls redundant and foster foreign investment and economic growth.",

In spite of considerable progress in fiscal adjustments towards lower budget deficits, fiscal imbalances still remain above the desirable level for macro-economic stability. The current account of the budget has been in deficit for several years in the past and deficit financing by the creation of domestic debt remained at a very high level. This practice over a long period of time has not only increased the public sector's financial burden on the rest of the economy, but also pre-empted resources otherwise available for productive investments in the private sector, hindering the exploitation of the country's full growth potential. On average, annual domestic borrowings of the government during the past five years accounted for 4.5 per cent of GDP undermining the imperatives of freeing a larger share of financial resources for private sector activity in the economy. Moreover, when the government resorts to high domestic borrowings, it raises domestic interest rates, encouraging speculative foreign capital inflows which complicate domestic liquidity management. This has imposed serious constraints on the use of market-based indirect monetary policy instru\u00adments such as open market operations to contain liquidity growth in recent months, underscoring the need for strong fiscal adjustments to achieve much needed price stability.",

An unexpected rapid surge in inflation will also redistribute existing wealth from creditors to debtors when debts are designated in fixed Rupee terms. Also, inflation tends to favour the rich at the expense of the poor, as the rich normally possess the capacity to hedge against inflation by carrying stocks and holding real assets, such as real estate and durable goods, whose value increases with inflation. Continuing high inflation causes undue hardships to fixed income earners such as pensioners, the elderly and the poor, e.g. recipients of fixed income welfare Viefits, through an erosion in their purchasing power, causing the incidence of poverty to rise. Thus, inflation renders poverty alleviation programmes less effective. It is noteworthy that almost all countries that achieved rapid growth were those who kept inflation in check.",

This will, in turn, lead to an erosion in international competitiveness of domestic industry, affecting the capacity to export.

In a typical policy response, the domestic currency might be depreciated to maintain international competitiveness, but each successive depreciation would raise import prices resulting in \"imported inflation,\". In addition, export competitiveness too would be affected as the import content of many exportable goods is normally high.

    "text": "Strong fiscal and monetary restraint together with structural reforms, particularly trade and financial sector reforms, are needed to curb inflationary pressures in the economy on a sustainable basis. To maintain the present high growth momentum a range of policy measures including tariff and financial sector reforms and removal of various bottlenecks in production and distribution are necessary to improve the allocative efficiency of the market mechanism. Moreover, it requires the management of aggregate demand through an appropriate fiscal and monetary policy mix in order to keep demand in line with domestic supply conditions. In this context, the short term corrective measures have to be viewed in a medium term framework. In sum, the use of a credible and well co-ordinated fiscal and monetary policy stance to counter the continuing build up of inflationary pressure is an inescapable necessity, if Sri Lanka is to consolidate the gains from recent economic reforms and bolster support for the on-going policy reforms, and sustain high growth momentum in the period ahead.",
