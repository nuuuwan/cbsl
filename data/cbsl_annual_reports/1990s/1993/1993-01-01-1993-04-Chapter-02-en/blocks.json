The outflow of investment income in 1993 remained at the same level as in 1992, although increased foreign investment had taken place. This is clearly indicative of a perception of Sri Lanka as having a favourable investment climate. Interest payments on account of foreign borrowings too declined in 1993. The large increase in the foreign assets held by the Central Bank resulted in a corresponding increase in interest income in 1993.

The severe drought of 1992, had resulted in a drop in paddy production by 2 per cent and a substantial decline of 25.7 per cent in tea production in that year. This situation was reversed in 1993, with tea recording a 29.6 per cent increase in output and paddy recording a 9.6 per cent increase in output. The Other Agriculture sub-sector also recorded a higher level of growth, in 1993 (1.4 per cent compared with 1.0 per cent in 1992). Significant growth in the value added in subsidiary food crops, minor export crops, fruits and livestock products enabled this sector to grow, even though vegetable production recorded a decline in 1993. The value added in the Rubber sub-sector increased by 1.8 per cent in 1993, a marginal decline in growth from the previous year.

Factory industries have a heavy bias towards textiles and apparel. Output in this category of industries rose by 30 per cent in 1993, while exports of textiles and garments increased by 17.4 per cent in SDR terms. Overall industrial exports grew by 20 per cent in 1993, in SDR terms.\"Growth in the Manufacturing sector was also boosted by the expansion in the Export Processing sub-sector, which contains the value added relating to the processing of tea, rubber and coconut kernal products. This sub-sector, which",

In Private consumption, the expenditure on imported goods and non-factor services rose at a higher rate than expenditure on domestically produced goods. This is in contrast to the pattern in 1992, when expenditure on imported goods and non-factor services increased only by a marginal 0.9 per cent. In 1993, expenditure on imported goods and non-factor services rose by 17.9 per cent, the bulk of the increase being seen in the imports of personal consumption goods. Private consumption expenditure on locally produced goods and services grew by 14.5 per cent as against a growth of 15.3 per cent in 1992.",
