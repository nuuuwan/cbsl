3.1 OverviewR

ecognising the importance of economic

and social infrastructure in facilitating

inclusive growth and development,

the government continued its investment in

enhancing the infrastructure base during 2016

amidst tight budgetary constraints. Economic

infrastructure enables the provision of services

that are consumed by the public while serving as

an input into private sector economic activities.

Hence, economic infrastructure augments output,

enhances output capacity and productivity

and reduces regional and social disparities.

Development of social infrastructure is critically

important to build a strong human capital base,

which promotes high productivity, while ensuring the

well-being of individuals for equitable and inclusive

development. Moreover, quality and access to

infrastructure are key determinants in improving

the competitiveness of an economy. Hence, for

Sri Lanka to harness its full growth potential and

attract foreign direct investments (FDI), the country

needs to maintain its infrastructure development

drive. However, with limited fiscal space,

tax-based funding by the government is not

adequate to meet the pressing needs for

infrastructure. Continuation of existing financing

arrangements in Sri Lanka for infrastructure

development will further increase the government

debt and may place the country's repayment

capacity under serious stress. In that perspective,

it is important for the government to attract private

investment for the provisioning of infrastructure

through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Meanwhile, by encouraging the private sector

to invest more in economic infrastructure, the

government will be able to create fiscal space to

allocate more funds to improve the provisioning of

essential social infrastructure, such as education and

health. Recognising the necessity for encouraging

private sector in infrastructure development, the

Cabinet has approved the establishment of a PPP

unit at the Ministry of Finance in January 2017,

with the support of the World Bank and USAID.

This unit is designed to attract private equity

investment for public infrastructure development

projects. The government policy framework for

encouraging PPPs for infrastructure development

needs to focus on increasing awareness among

all stake holders, including politicians and policy

makers, while creating necessary regulatory and

administrative mechanisms to encourage private

investment and to ensure quality of services and

fair pricing. It should also be noted that consistent

policies, good governance and transparency,

institutional capacity building, effective regulations

and efficient financial markets are prerequisites

in promoting private investment in both economic

and social infrastructure projects. In addition,

infrastructure development projects should be

subjected to thorough feasibility assessments to

prioritise projects with high returns to the economy

to ensure efficiency of resource allocation.

While various public infrastructure projects

were in progress during 2016, the main focus of

the government’s infrastructure development

drive was on improving regional connectivity

through an efficient road network. Accordingly,

the government continued to invest in the

construction of expressways, namely, the Southern

Expressway Expansion project, the Outer Circular

Highway and the Central Expressway that enhance

the connectivity between Western, Southern,

North Central and Central Provinces. In addition,

the i-ROAD programme, Priority Roads Project,

Northern Road Connectivity Project and several

bridge construction projects were underway during

the year through funding from local and foreign

sources. Further, the government has invested

considerably in railroad construction, urban and

town centre development and irrigation systems

while adhering to the government's policy on free

health and education, and ensuring the availability

of a safety-net for the poor. Furthermore, the

government launched its flagship project, the

Western Region Megapolis Master Plan, in 2016

with an anticipated cost of US dollars 40 billion

aimed at transforming the Western Province into

a vibrant, liveable cosmopolitan region. This would

help to resolve issues related to urbanisation, such

as traffic congestion, poor housing conditions,

waste disposal and access to basic utility services

by improving essential infrastructure, such as

Information and Communication Technology (ICT),

transport, power and energy.

New investment, cost-reflective pricing

strategies and productivity enhancements

boost the financial viability of State-Owned

Business Enterprises (SOBEs). The financial

performance of the Ceylon Electricity Board

(CEB) deteriorated in 2016 largely due to the low

hydropower generation in response to drought

conditions that prevailed in the country. Planned

development activities, such as Western Region

Megapolis Master Plan, including the Colombo

Financial City, the development of industrial

zones in Hambantota, Trincomalee and the North

Western Province, as well as anticipated higher

economic activities, are expected to rapidly

increase the energy requirement of the country

within the next few years. Therefore, priority must

be attached to investment in power generation

sources to meet the incremental base energy

requirement and ensure energy security by

catering to the expanding energy demand of the

economy. Hence, the government's infrastructure

development plan needs to give due consideration

towards setting up of a mega plant with 500 MW

generation capacity by 2020 in line with CEB's long

term generation expansion plan, in order to ensure

energy security. At the same time, it is crucial for the

economy to select cost-effective energy sources,

since very high generation costs will further

deteriorate the financial viability of the CEB, and

ultimately affect the margins of the entrepreneurs

and their competitiveness in the export market. At

present, Sri Lanka's electricity tariff is already high

in comparison to other countries in the South Asian

region. Therefore, the appropriate energy mix for

the country should be selected through a thorough

cost-benefit analysis, considering capital and

operational costs of the power plants as well as

the cost of their environmental effects.

Simultaneously, fair and cost-reflective pricing

strategies are necessary for the financial viability

of SOBEs to reduce the financial burden on

the government coffers and curb the balance

sheet deterioration of state banks due to heavy

borrowings by loss-making SOBEs. Since the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) is one of

the strategically important SOBEs, tax payers of

the country have to ultimately bear any financial

losses of the CPC. Current market trends indicate

a potential weakening of the financial position of

the CPC in near future. Hence, strengthening

the debt collection mechanism of the CPC

and accelerating the process of introducing a

market-based pricing mechanism for petroleum

products are vital steps to ensure the financial

viability of the CPC. These measures are necessary

to ensure a healthy cash-flow position and reduce

the dependence of the CPC on the borrowings

from state banks. Further, maintaining a massive

loss making SOBE, such as SriLankan Airlines

(SLA), is a huge burden to the government budget.

Therefore, the measures taken towards securing

a strategic partner for the SLA are important in

the current context and have to be accomplished

to resolve the need for capital injection and debt

consolidation and thereby remove the burden on

the government fiscal operations. Demand-driven

productivity enhancements are necessary for

SOBEs operating in railway, civil aviation and

postal services to improve their financial

performances. In addition, the government and

regulatory authorities need to monitor the progress

of the larger SOBEs in terms of achieving the targets

of strategic business plans. The decision of the

Cabinet of Ministers to introduce the ‘Statements

of Corporate Intent’ for five key SOBEs, in March

2017, is a commendable step towards improving

long-term financial viability of these SOBEs and

their accountability. It is important for all SOBEs

to develop their own strategic business plans with

medium term and long term targets that are clearly

linked with the national economic strategy.

The importance of private sector

participation in provisioning of social

infrastructure has been rapidly increasing

during the last few years with the rising

purchasing power of the middle income group

in the society. With increased purchasing power,

consumers tend to demand efficient and high quality

health and education services. Social goods, such

as primary and secondary education and health,

have higher social returns than private returns and

hence, private investments are likely to fall short of

what is required by the economy. As a result, state

intervention has become prominent in the provision

of such social infrastructure. While ensuring that

low income groups have sufficient access to these

facilities, the government also needs to enhance

the provision of these services by facilitating the

private sector to meet the increased demand by

high and middle income groups. Therefore, it is

imperative for the government to develop the

institutional frameworks, such as quality assurance

guidelines, regulatory and monitoring mechanisms

and legal frameworks that are applicable across

both private and state sector institutions while

providing other complementary resources, such as

institutional support for the private sector to take-on

social infrastructure projects. This is necessary in

order to ensure that private institutions balance their

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

94

profit making objectives and social responsibilities,

thereby contributing to the economy at large.

Quality assurance and monitoring mechanisms are

necessary for government entities also to ensure

efficient and effective use of government funds and

continuous quality enhancements in their service

delivery to cater to the expectations of individuals

and requirements of markets. This needs to

be augmented by implementing much needed

reforms, particularly in general and higher education

sectors, to address the mismatch between demand

and supply in the labour market. Considering the

budgetary constraint and the natural expansion

in the private sector, clear and consistent policies

related to the private sector provision of higher

education are necessary in order to provide

opportunities for students, who seek higher

education from the private sector, as the state is

able to provide opportunities for approximately

19 per cent of those who qualify for tertiary

education each year.

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Communication Services

The telecommunication industry

continued its growth momentum in 2016

largely supported by increased telephone

and internet connections. The total number of

mobile telephone connections available in the

country increased by 7.6 per cent to 26.2 million

by end 2016 in comparison to the previous

year. Meanwhile, fixed wireline telephone

connections increased by 3.4 per cent to 1.2

million connections from 1.1 million connections

as at end 2015. However, the total fixed wireless

connections available in the country continued to

decelerate during the period under review, with a

decline of 6.0 per cent to 1.4 million connections

in comparison to 1.5 million connections recorded

at end 2015. Consequently, total fixed telephone

connections also declined by 2.0 per cent by

end 2016. The reduction in total fixed wireless

connections was mainly due to the conversion

of fixed wireless to mobile connections and fixed

wireline telephone connections for the purpose

of obtaining broadband connections. With these

developments, the fixed telephone penetration

(connections per 100 persons) and the mobile

telephone penetration stood at 12.0 and 123.7,

respectively, by the end of the period under

review. With regard to internet services, total

internet connections grew by 20.3 per cent to

4,920,554 during the year, increasing the internet

penetration to 23.2 by end 2016. The growth in

internet connections was largely supported by

the fixed internet connections, which recorded an

accelerated growth of 36.1 per cent during 2016.

Meanwhile, mobile internet connections grew by

17.1 per cent to 3,991,465 connections by end

2016, in comparison to 3,408,408 connections

recorded in the previous year. Meanwhile, active

usage of ICT services in economic activities,

such as e-banking, e-business, mobile banking,

e-bus ticketing, and mobile point of sale (POS),

has also increased in recent years. Higher

penetration in telecommunication services in

Sri Lanka has supported the socioeconomic

development of the country and played an

important role in narrowing down the rural-urban

digital divide.

The government has identified

telecommunication and digital infrastructure

as two core areas that enhance digital

ecosystems and economic development. The

widespread use of ICT stimulates inclusive growth

and job creation, especially by empowering the

self-employed and small enterprises. Improved

access to telecommunication services enables

individuals to access the market through

digital modes of marketing, thereby increasing

income and profits while reducing transaction

costs. Further, digital infrastructure can offer

work opportunities for people who generally

face obstacles to work outside of their homes,

due to geographical remoteness, physical

disability or cultural barriers. The progress in

telecommunication services fosters individual

productivity through increased access to

education. Meanwhile, the growing penetration

of connectivity and increasing affordability of

devices are expected to provide a range of financial

services to both small-scale entrepreneurs and

low-income households, enabling them to grow

their businesses and make financial transactions

smoothly. Innovations in mobile payment systems

and peer-to-peer lending platforms enhance the

access to financial services and credit while

reducing the cost of businesses. Therefore,

recognising the vital role of telecommunication

and digital infrastructure for economic growth,

the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital

Infrastructure and Telecommunications Regulatory

Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) organised the

Sri Lanka Broadband Forum for the first time in

the country in 2016. Global and local broadband

landscape was analysed by industry experts

at this forum, with the participation of industry

leaders. In addition, several policy measures

were proposed in the Budget 2017 to boost

telecommunication and digital infrastructure

of the country. The government has instructed

all mobile telephone operators to convert their

infrastructure to provide 3G coverage to all metro

areas of the country by end June 2017 with the

aim of stimulating the country’s digitalisation

process. Any operator who fails to provide 3G

coverage within the first six months of 2017 will

be liable for a surcharge of Rs.100 million per

district. Furthermore, mobile telephone service

providers are requested to provide 4G coverage

to all metro areas of the country by end June

2018.

The TRCSL continued to promote

quality-oriented fair competition among

licensed telecommunication service providers

while ensuring consumer protection. The

TRCSL has prepared a set of 'Quality of

Service (QoS)' parameters for fixed and mobile

voice services after a public consultation.

The telecommunication service providers are

required to submit monthly reports on the use

of QoS parameters and indicate any factors

beyond their control that may have prevented

them from achieving the targets specified by the

TRCSL in terms of QoS. Further, the TRCSL has

planned to conduct a network audit, a process

in which the network is mapped both in terms of

software and hardware once in two months, to

check the authenticity of measured parameter

values submitted by the service providers on a

monthly basis. Moreover, with the increase in

internet penetration in Sri Lanka, the speed of the

internet connection has become a key concern

among internet users. Therefore, the TRCSL has

installed an 'Internet Speed Test Tool' for internet

users to measure the speed of connections.

Meanwhile, the TRCSL decided to place three

'test end servers' in Singapore, Europe and

USA data centres, as most of the content

used by the Sri Lankan internet community

are hosted in these countries. In addition, the

TRCSL installed a 'Net Speed' tool to measure

the internet speed of connections provided by

the telecommunication service providers on a

common platform and publish the test results for

public information. The TRCSL also introduced a

process to prepare a 'National Broadband Policy'

for Sri Lanka, in consultation with the government

and private sector stakeholders. The aim of this

initiative is to develop a high level framework

to promote and facilitate the expansion and

utilisation of broadband services in the country.

This policy document is expected to be finalised

by end 2017, initially covering a five year period.

It is expected that the national broadband policy

would help to improve the availability, affordability

and usage of broadband services and thereby

enhance opportunities for access to education,

health, agriculture and other public services

with greater transparency, and cost effective

options for delivery of various government and

commercial services. The Colombo Lotus Tower

project of the TRCSL, which has an estimated

cost of US dollars 104.3 million, is expected

to be completed in the second half of 2017,

facilitating the transmission of signals of over 50

radio stations and 50 digital video broadcasting

channels while providing numerous commercial

and entertainment amenities.

The Information and Communication

Technology Agency (ICTA) continued its

effort to enhance the accessibility of ICT

services in the country. The number of

government institutions that are connected to the

Lanka Government Network (LGN) increased to

860 during the year, providing remote services

to citizens through a secure electronic platform.

Several government eServices were developed

during the year, such as eServices to monitor

registration of motor vehicles, issuance of

driving licenses and the provision of location

based information on the Sri Lankan heritage

to promote tourism. The ICTA also focused on

skills development of public sector workers at all

levels by conducting various capacity building

programmes to improve the capacity of public

services in handling ICT.

The Department of Posts (DOP) continued

its services amid high penetration in

telecommunication services in the country.

By end 2016, the postal service comprised

652 main post offices, 3,410 sub post offices,

524 agency post offices, 101 rural agency post

offices and four estate agency post offices. The

DOP continued to diversify its services with the

objective of enhancing the financial position of

the DOP. Accordingly, measures were taken

to introduce new agency services, including

distribution of insurance premiums and insurance

certificates through the post office network in

2016. Meanwhile, the government decided to

keep the postage tariffs unchanged in 2016. The

financial position of the DOP further weakened in

2016. The operating loss of the DOP increased

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

97

by 13.1 per cent to Rs. 5.7 billion in 2016, in

comparison to the loss of Rs. 5.0 billion in 2015.

This was the net outcome of the decline in total

revenue by 2.0 per cent to Rs. 6.6 billion and the

increase in operating expenditure by 4.5 per cent

to Rs. 12.3 billion in 2016 in comparison to the

preceding year. The increased losses of the DOP

could be attributed to the increased availability

of alternative modes of communication and the

lack of a cost-effective pricing mechanism apart

from the fact that the operational structure of the

postal services has remained broadly unchanged.

However, given the increased financial losses

incurred by the DOP, new initiatives have to be

undertaken by the DOP to enhance its revenue

by diversifying and expanding the services to

reap the full benefit of improved technology while

curtailing expenditure to reduce the burden on

the government budget.

Petroleum

Despite the rising trend seen in international

prices since the beginning of 2016, the annual

average international crude oil (Brent) price

in 2016 was lower than the previous year, as

global crude oil prices were higher in the first

half of 2015 in comparison to 2016. The annual

average price of Brent in the international market

declined by 16.2 per cent to US dollars 45.03 in

2016 from US dollars 53.75 in 2015. Prices fell to

a record 12-year low level in January 2016 amidst

worries on a glut in global supply on the backdrop of

an expected increase in oil exports with the lifting of

sanctions on Iran. Accordingly, the monthly average

international Brent price fell to US dollars 32.23 per

barrel in January 2016. However, average Brent

prices gradually recovered from US dollars 33.63

per barrel in February 2016 to US dollars 49.82 per

barrel in June 2016, based on market speculations

on possible oil supply cuts by the Organisation of

the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and

non-OPEC oil producing countries. However, at the

end of June 2016, the uncertainty over the Brexit from

the European Union (EU) resulted in a temporary

drop in petroleum prices in global markets. During the

second half of the year, the average Brent crude oil

price fluctuated around US dollars 48.95 per barrel due

to the excess supply, stronger dollar and the market

expectations of supply cuts by the oil producers. In

December 2016, the OPEC agreed to cut production

for six months from January 2017 by around 1.2 million

barrels per day (bpd) to 32.5 million bpd while the

non-OPEC member Russia agreed to cut output

by 0.3 million bpd. Although there were persistent

doubts that this production cut would not be sufficient

to end a supply overhang, the average Brent crude

oil price increased up to US dollars 54.74 per barrel in

December 2016 after other non-OPEC oil producers

also agreed to reduce their output by 0.3 million bpd.

This was the first coordinated action by the OPEC

and non-OPEC countries to jointly reduce output

since 2001.

The average price of crude oil imported by

the CPC largely followed trends in global oil

markets. Consequently, the average price of crude

oil imported by the CPC declined by 15.5 per cent

to US dollars 46.30 per barrel in 2016 from the

annual average price of US dollars 54.80 per barrel

in the preceding year. The average import price of

total refined petroleum products also declined by

19.9 per cent to US dollars 434.62 per MT in 2016,

from US dollars 542.61 per MT in 2015.

While the cost of imported petroleum products

remained subdued, domestic retail prices of

petroleum products remained unchanged in 2016

due to the significant downward revision to retail

petroleum prices in 2015. However, the retail price

of kerosene was reduced by Rs. 5 per litre with effect

from 09 January 2017 to Rs. 44 per litre, to transfer

the benefit of lower global oil prices to the consumers.

The demand for petroleum products from

energy generation and transportation sectors

increased substantially during the year, mainly

due to the increased demand for transport

service as well as the higher thermal-based

power generation caused by erratic weather

patterns during the latter part of 2016. Petroleum

sales to the energy generation in Sri Lanka grew by

103.9 per cent in 2016 in comparison to the previous

year. Petroleum sales to the transportation and aviation

sectors in 2016 grew by 8.7 per cent and 11.3 per cent,

respectively. Domestic sales of diesel increased by

19.9 per cent in 2016 in comparison to the

previous year. Further, the domestic sales of petrol

products increased by 16.0 per cent during 2016

relative to the preceding year, reflecting the higher

demand for petroleum products from the transport

sector. The furnace oil sales also increased by

29.8 per cent in 2016 in comparison to 2015 due

to the higher dependency on thermal power for

power generation. The kerosene sales increased by

5.6 per cent during 2016 in comparison to the

preceding year owing to the higher demand for

kerosene.

The CPC's financial position improved in

2016 recording a substantial operating profit as

against an operating loss recorded in 2015. As

per the provisional unaudited financial statements,

the CPC reported a profit of Rs. 69.6 billion,

before taxes, in 2016 in comparison to a loss of

Rs. 19.9 billion, before taxes, in the preceding

year. The lower average level of crude oil prices

that prevailed in international markets contributed

heavily for the substantial profits generated by the

CPC. At the same time, gross liabilities of the CPC

to the banking sector declined by 27.2 per cent

from Rs. 264.5 billion to Rs. 192.6 billion by end

2016. Meanwhile, local currency deposits of the

CPC with the state banks registered an increase

of 65.0 per cent from Rs. 19.9 billion in 2015 to

Rs. 32.8 billion by end 2016. However, the CPC’s

outstanding trade receivables from government

entities increased by 101.8 per cent to Rs. 31.1

billion as at end 2016, from Rs. 15.4 billion as at

end 2015. The government entities in the electricity

generation sector contributed to 64.3 per cent of

the trade receivables of the CPC.

Ensuring financial viability of the CPC is

crucial since financial losses made by the

CPC adversely affect the government budget,

while higher borrowings by the CPC lead to

balance sheet deterioration of the state banks.

The rising trend in oil prices owing to production

cuts by leading oil producers and the depreciation

of the exchange rate are likely to increase the

cost of oil imports to the CPC. Therefore, current

market trends indicate a potential weakening of the

financial position of the CPC in near future. Since

the CPC is a SOBE, financial losses of the CPC

ultimately will have to be borne by the tax payers

of the country. Therefore, accelerating the process

of introducing a market-based pricing mechanism

for petroleum products and strengthening the debt

collection mechanism of the CPC are important

measures to be taken to ensure the financial viability

of the CPC. These measures will ensure a healthy

cash-flow position and reduce the dependency of

CPC on the borrowings from state banks.

The Cabinet of Ministers has taken several

important decisions during 2015 and 2016

to accelerate oil and gas exploration and

development activities. The government

of Sri Lanka entered into an agreement with

US-based IHS Energy in December 2016 to

develop a marketing strategy, bid documents and

partner selection criteria for consideration by the

Sri Lankan government in relation to Block M2. It

is expected to award the M2 exploration block to a

suitable oil and gas company by the fourth quarter

of 2017 to further explore and develop natural gas

reserves. Moreover, the government entered into

a Joint Study Agreement with the French major,

Total, in February 2016 to explore the hydrocarbon

potential in two ultra-deep water blocks (JS5 and

JS6) off the East coast of Sri Lanka by conducting

geological, geophysical and technical surveys, and

analysing and interpreting the acquired data with

the view to ultimately assessing the presence of

commercially viable oil gas. Another agreement

was signed between the Sri Lankan government

and WesternGeco Seismic Holding Limited, a major

oil and gas service company, to reprocess, market

and sell 2D seismic data of Mannar Basin. This

value-added reprocessed data will help to enhance

interpretation and basin modelling capabilities of

Sri Lanka.

Electricity

Total electricity generation in 2016 increased

by 8.1 per cent to 14,149 GWh in comparison

to 13,090 GWh recorded in 2015. Although hydro

based power generation gradually improved during

the second quarter of the year with increased rainfall

received during May 2016, the drought conditions

that prevailed during the first quarter and the latter

part of the year caused a reduction in the share of

hydropower in the total annual power generation

in 2016. Accordingly, hydropower generation,

excluding mini hydro generation, registered a

decline of 29.0 per cent to 3,481 GWh, while the

fuel oil-based power generation witnessed an

increase of 96.1 per cent to 4,461 GWh in 2016

in comparison to the previous year. Meanwhile, total

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

100

coal power generation increased by 13.6 per cent to

5,047 GWh in 2016, relative to the previous year,

despite breakdowns in the Norochcholai coal

power plant. The generation of electricity through

non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE)

sources, including mini-hydro generation,

decreased by 20.9 per cent to 1,160 GWh in 2016

from 2015. Accordingly, the share of hydro, fuel oil,

coal and NCRE in total power generation remained

at 25 per cent, 32 per cent, 36 per cent and

8 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, the contribution

of the power plants owned by the CEB to the total

power generation decreased to 76.5 per cent in

2016 from 79.4 per cent in 2015. As in the previous

years, the remainder of the total power generation

in 2016 was purchased from Independent Power

Producers (IPPs). Meanwhile, overall transmission

and distribution loss as a percentage of total power

generation reduced to 9.6 per cent in 2016, from the

10.0 per cent in the previous year due to measures

taken to reduce transmission losses by improving

transmission lines.

The total sales of electricity in 2016

increased by 8.5 per cent to 12,785 GWh

from 11,786 GWh recorded in 2015. High

growth in electricity sales in recent years can

be mainly attributed to low tariffs prevailing

at present compared to 2014. Sales to the

‘Industry’ category that absorbed 32.6 per

cent of the total electricity sales, increased by

6.9 per cent in 2016 in comparison to an increase of

3.2 per cent in 2015. During 2016, sales to ‘Hotel’

and ‘General Purposes’ categories accounted

for 2.4 per cent and 24.2 per cent of the total

electricity sales, respectively. Meanwhile, in

2016 the electricity sales to ‘Hotel’ and ‘General

Purposes’ categories recorded a growth of

18.0 per cent and 11.1 per cent, respectively,

in comparison to the preceding year. In 2016,

the electricity consumption by the ‘Domestic’

category, which absorbed 37.8 per cent of total

electricity sales, grew by 8.3 per cent.

The financial performance of the CEB

deteriorated in 2016 largely due to the low

hydropower generation during the second half

of the year in response to drought conditions

that prevailed in most parts of the country.

The breakdown of the Norochcholai coal power

plant also partly contributed to the increased

requirement for thermal power generation during

2016. In 2016, the CEB’s average cost of hydro,

coal and fuel oil-based power generation was

Rs. 2.38, Rs. 6.61 and Rs. 24.38 per unit,

respectively. Further, the CEB purchased electricity

from IPPs at an average purchasing price of

Rs. 24.64 per unit. Accordingly, the CEB’s average

cost of electricity amounted to Rs. 18.08 per unit

at the selling point, while the overall average tariff

was Rs. 16.18 per unit, reflecting a loss margin

of Rs. 1.90 per unit at the selling point. The

average tariff charged by the CEB from domestic,

general purpose, government, industrial and hotel

sectors stood at Rs. 13.41, Rs. 23.94, Rs. 18.25,

Rs. 14.62, and Rs. 17.69 per unit, respectively.

According to provisional financial data, the CEB

recorded a loss of Rs. 13.2 billion in 2016, in

contrast to a profit before tax of Rs. 19.4 billion

recorded in 2015. The increased requirement for

fuel oil-based power generation in response to low

hydropower generation elevated the CEB’s cost on

fuel oil by 116.6 per cent to Rs. 50.1 billion in 2016.

Meanwhile, the CEB’s short term borrowings from

commercial banks and other short-term liabilities

to the CPC and IPPs increased by Rs. 35.7 billion

to Rs. 91.7 billion by end 2016, while long-term

outstanding liabilities, mainly to the banking sector

and the government, decreased by Rs. 21.6 billion

to Rs. 284.5 billion as at end 2016.

During 2016, several measures were

undertaken to enhance the electrification

level in the country. The government initiated a

programme named 'Ratama Eliyai - Andura Duralai'

with the aim of providing electricity at concessional

rates to low-income families in order to achieve 100

per cent electrification in the country. According to

CEB’s provisional data, the level of electrification of

the country has been raised to 99.3 per cent by end

2016 from 98.5 per cent at end 2015. Construction

work of the Uma Oya Hydropower Project and

Braodlands Hydropower Project was in progress

during 2016 and these power plants are expected

to be connected to the national grid by mid-2018

and mid-2019, respectively. In addition, preparatory

work was in progress to construct the Gin Ganga

Hydropower Project (20MW), three hydropower

units in the Moragahakanda Hydropower Project

(total of 25MW), Moragolla Hydropower Project

(30.5MW) and the Mannar Wind Power Project

(100MW). Further, plans are underway to establish

two thermal power plants to meet the growing

energy demand in the medium term until major

thermal power plants are added to the system.

Accordingly, a 170MW furnace oil fired power plant

will be established in the Southern region, which

is expected to commission in 2017. In addition, a

300MW natural gas fired combined cycle power

plant will be established in Kerawalapitiya, where

the open cycle and combined cycle are expected to

be commissioned in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

It is expected that the major power generation

projects that are currently being constructed and

those that are in the pipeline will add a total of

757.5 MW altogether to the national grid by end

2020. In addition, by end 2016, the CEB has signed

agreements for 105 NCRE projects, with a capacity

of 288 MW.

The Ministry of Power and Renewable

Energy launched a new community based

power generation project called 'Soorya Bala

Sangramaya' in collaboration with the Sri Lanka

Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA), the CEB

and the Lanka Electricity Company (Private)

Limited (LECO) in 2016. The purpose of this project

is to promote self-energy generation by households,

religious places, commercial establishments and

industries. Promotion of electricity generation through

renewable sources has become a major focus of the

government as well as private sector investors in the

recent period. Under the 'Soorya Bala Sangramaya'

project, any household or premises owner with a

valid electricity account will be exempted from the

requirement of obtaining a generation license to

generate solar power. Further, the households that

produce solar power in excess of their requirement

can sell the excess to the national grid or bank it

for later use. According to the electricity usage, the

consumer can select a preferred option out of three

schemes: Net Metering, Net Accounting and Net

Plus (Micro Solar Power Producer). Such electricity

consumers will be compensated for the damages of

equipment caused by abnormal voltages and phase

reversals in the electricity distribution systems with

effect from 13 January 2017. This programme is

expected to add 200 MW of solar electricity to the

national grid by 2020 and 1,000 MW by 2025.

The share of NCRE generation of the total

power generation remained at 8 per cent of the

total power generation in 2016. However, as

many households and business enterprises are

increasingly utilising standalone renewable power

generation modes, the actual share of NCRE

generation in total electricity generation is likely to

be higher than this. The SLSEA, which has been

actively engaged in promoting increased adoption

and sustainable use of renewable energy sources

in the country, has taken steps to issue energy

permits and provisional approvals for on-grid

renewable energy projects aimed at accelerating

the development of indigenous renewable energy

resources into commercial scale projects. Up to the

end of 2016, 172 mini hydropower projects, 15 wind

power plants, nine biomass power plants and five

solar power projects have been commissioned,

adding approximately 342.2 MW, 128.5 MW,

24.1 MW and 21.4 MW, respectively, to the national

grid. Accordingly, the total electricity generation

using renewable energy in 2016 amounted to

1,160 GWh. The SLSEA implemented several

energy conservation programmes, focusing

on regulatory interventions and strengthening

energy efficiency in the services sector. In

addition, two major renewable energy projects,

namely solar rooftop power generation project,

and estate micro hydro rehabilitation and

repowering project, initiated by the SLSEA with

financial assistance from the Asian Development

Bank (ADB) are currently in progress. As the

power sector faces many challenges, especially

in relation to the supply of uninterrupted electricity

for the entire country at affordable prices, the

government has set targets to address the

adverse impacts arising from high reliance on

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

103

imported fuel for power generation. Accordingly,

as an alternative to imported fossil fuel, the

government has targeted to attain 20 per cent of

electricity generation of the national grid through

new renewable energy sources by 2020. The

government also targeted a reduction of around

10 per cent of the total energy consumption

by 2020 through various energy conservation

measures.

Although the generation of electricity

through NCRE sources, including mini-hydro

generation and solar power, is important to

improve the energy security, the CEB needs

to expand its base power capacity to meet

the increasing demand. The energy security of

the country has to be improved by reducing the

dependence on hydropower generation that is

contingent on weather factors. However, in order

to meet the growing energy demand, mainly in

the industrial sector and to facilitate private

sector investments, the country will have to

enhance its energy security by obtaining energy

supplies at affordable prices. A more conducive

policy environment, coupled with an effective

regulatory regime, is important for widening the

generation sources while minimising potential

social unrest caused by power shortages. Energy

security in the country requires integrated actions

by all stakeholders. Further, the base power has

to be further strengthened by giving due attention

to low-cost power generation while meeting

any positive deviation during the peak demand

through hydro based power generation. In this

context, establishing a mega scale power plant in

the national grid is essential as per the generation

expansion plan of the CEB. This will also improve

the financial position of the CEB through reduced

dependence on more expensive fuel oil based

power generation and help to ensure energy

security in the short to medium term.

Road Development

Road development and rehabilitation

continued to be an area of priority in public

investments by the government. The Road

Development Authority (RDA) spent Rs. 49.3

billion on expressway development and Rs. 43.3

billion on highway development while spending

Rs. 10.9 billion on widening and improvement of

roads during 2016. At the same time, the RDA

has invested Rs. 10.6 billion on the construction

of bridges and flyovers and Rs. 118 million on

the rehabilitation of roads, which were affected by

natural disasters, such as landslides and floods,

during 2016. Therefore, the total investments of

RDA on roads and bridges amounted to Rs. 114.2

billion in 2016. During the year under review, the

total length of National Highways (Class A and

Class B roads) and Expressways maintained by the

RDA were 12,210 km and 169.84 km, respectively.

Several road construction, rehabilitation

and maintenance projects were implemented in

2016 with the financial support of foreign and

local sources. The i-ROAD programme, funded by

the ADB, intends to rehabilitate selected rural and

national roads in the Southern, Sabaragamuwa,

Central, North Central, North Western and Western

Provinces. These rehabilitated roads will be

mandatorily maintained by the i-ROAD programme

for a three year period. The ADB is providing

US dollars 800 million for the i-ROAD programme

through a Multi-tranche Financing Facility (MFF),

of which three tranches, amounting to US dollars

407 million, were released by end 2016. The Sri

Lankan government also contributes to the project

by investing US dollars 106 million under the i-ROAD

programme. Accordingly, during 2016, Rs. 16.9

billion had been used to rehabilitate roads in selected

districts. The Priority Roads Project, financed by

the China Development Bank (CDB), focuses on

rehabilitating sections of the national highway network

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

104

that are selected on a priority basis. Priority Roads

Project-1 and Priority Roads Project-2 have been

completed in 2015 and currently, the first phase of

the Priority Roads Project-3 is in progress. The CDB

provided US dollars 300 million for the first phase

of the Priority Roads Project-3. The Northern Road

Connectivity Project (NRCP), which rehabilitated and

improved 169.9 km of national highways consisting

of 128.5 km of Class A roads and 41.4 km of Class

B roads in the Northern and North Central Provinces,

was completed in 2016. The total expenditure on

national roads by the NRCP was US dollars 145.85

million, for which ADB contributed 89 per cent and

the government contributed 11 per cent of the funds.

Since US dollars 20 million loan proceeds were on

surplus from the NRCP, the government requested

the ADB to scale-up the financing through the

NRCP-Additional Financing Project. Accordingly,

the rehabilitation of 118 km of national highways,

consisting of 61.2 km of Class A roads and 56.2 km

of Class B roads in the Northern and North Central

Provinces, was completed during 2016 using

US dollars 133.5 million. In addition, the World

Bank has allocated US dollars 36 million to the RDA

under the Climate Resilience Improvement Project

(CRIP) in order to improve the climate resilience

of road infrastructure and a substantial amount of

work under this project has already been completed.

Further, several projects on bridge construction and

rehabilitation were implemented through bilateral

funding arrangements with Japan, France, Austria,

Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Kuwait and the

OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID)

during 2016. A new bridge over the Kelani River at

Peliyagoda is planned to be constructed to mitigate

and disperse the traffic congestion caused by the

heavy traffic flow that is coming into the Colombo

City through the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway.

Preliminary work related to this project was

completed in 2016 and the construction of the bridge

will commence in May 2017. The Maga Neguma

Rural Road Development Programme also continued

during 2016 targeting to rehabilitate 157 km of rural

roads in several districts achieving 56 per cent of the

physical progress by end 2016.

The construction work of several new

expressways continued in 2016. The construction

work of the Southern Expressway Extension project

from Matara to Hambantota continued in 2016 and is

scheduled to be completed in 2019. In addition, land

acquisition work was in progress in respect of the

168.7 km long Central Expressway project, which

will link Kadawatha and Dambulla. This project will

also have an expressway component that connects

Pothuhera and Galagedara. Further, work related

to land acquisition, civil work contract, supervision

consultancy, and survey and field testing work

have been carried out for the Phase-III of the Outer

Circular Highway (OCH) project. The section of the

highway from the Kerawalapitiya Interchange to the

Kadawatha Interchange will be constructed under

the Phase-III of the OCH. Meanwhile, expressways

that are currently in operation have generated a

revenue of Rs. 7.0 billion during 2016, whereas the

total revenue from expressways in 2015 stood at

Rs. 5.3 billion. The total vehicle traffic in the Southern

Expressway grew by 33.8 per cent to 10.4 million

vehicles in 2016. Further, revenue generated from

the toll collections from the Southern Expressway

grew by 29.0 per cent to Rs. 3.2 billion during

2016 in comparison to the previous year. Traffic

in the Colombo Katunayake Expressway grew by

17.0 per cent to 8.8 million vehicles, while the

total revenue collection grew by 15.5 per cent to

Rs. 2.5 billion during 2016 in comparison to 2015.

The volume of vehicle traffic in the OCH in 2015

and 2016 stood at 2.3 million and 5.9 million,

respectively. Accordingly, the total revenue collection

from the OCH increased by 104.1 per cent to Rs. 1.4

billion during the year under review in comparison

to the preceding year. The steady increase in

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

105

the usage of expressways indicates the higher

purchasing power of the commuters and increased

willingness to pay for such expressway networks.

Therefore, it is important to carryout feasibility

studies to construct additional expressways

through PPPs to link all major cities and regions

and thereby develop an efficient road network

system throughout the country.

Several steps were taken during 2016

to improve road safety and reduce traffic

congestion in major cities. Construction work in

relation to flyovers at the Rajagiriya junction and

Polgahawela and Ganemulla railway crossings

was in progress during 2016. In addition, a

technical assistance project for the establishment

of an Advance Traffic Management System in

the Colombo metropolitan region, supported by

a grant from Korea International Cooperation

Agency (KOICA), was in progress during the

year. This project aims to support the economic

activities of the Colombo metropolitan region by

relieving traffic congestion, strengthening the traffic

safety and improving public transport. Currently,

the project is at the detailed design stage and the

traffic management strategy is to be established by

considering the current traffic congestion and traffic

management capability of Colombo. Further, Pelican

Crossings and traffic signals were installed in several

locations throughout the country during 2016.

Road Passenger Transportation

Public road passenger transportation

continued to play an important role in the

provision of transport facilities throughout

the country. The total operated kilometres

of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), at

451.5 million km, witnessed an increase of 2.5 per

cent in 2016 from the previous year, while total

passenger kilometrage increased by 6.1 per cent to

16.1 billion km. In 2016, the operated kilometrage

of private buses increased by 1.8 per cent to 1,030.5

million km, while passenger kilometrage improved

by 2.0 per cent to 52.1 billion km in comparison to

2015. Meanwhile, annual bus fares were revised

with effect from 01 August 2016 for both state and

private bus operations. Accordingly, bus fares were

increased by 6 per cent with the minimum bus fare

increasing from Rs. 8.00 to Rs. 9.00.

The fleet operations of both the SLTB and the

private bus sector improved, although the fleet

position of the SLTB marginally deteriorated in

2016. The SLTB undertook a series of auctions in

2016 to dispose obsolete buses. As a result, the

total number of buses owned by the SLTB declined

by 266 to 7,781 by the end of 2016. During the

year, Rs. 1,069 million was spent by the SLTB to

rehabilitate and repair the existing bus fleet and the

General Treasury provided Rs. 800 million to finance

the expenses. In addition, the Ministry of Transport

and Civil Aviation commenced a crash project with

the objective of enhancing the fleet position of the

SLTB and accordingly, 87 buses were rehabilitated.

Due to the introduction of new bus trips and the

resumption of bus trips that were stopped previously,

the average number of buses operated per day by

the SLTB improved to 5,315 in 2016 as compared

to 5,284 operated in 2015. The number of buses

owned by private operators increased to 19,614 in

2016 from 19,397 in 2015, while the average bus

fleet operated by private bus operators increased to

17,131 in 2016, from 16,942 in the previous year.

The number of inter-provincial permits issued by the

National Transport Commission (NTC) for private

bus operations increased from 3,114 to 3,212 during

2016, while the number of intra-provincial permits

decreased from 16,503 to 16,322.

The NTC continued to provide transport

facilities for needy and vulnerable groups. The

NTC continued Sisu Seriya, Gemi Seriya and Nisi

Seriya programmes through the SLTB to provide

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

106

socially obligatory transport services, which are not

provided by the private sector. Accordingly, 1,299

Sisu Seriya services were in operation by the end

of 2016 to cater the school children. Further, 10

Gemi Seriya bus services were in operation by

the end of 2016 to provide economic and reliable

transport facilities to the rural areas that lack proper

transport modes. In addition, 123 Nisi Seriya bus

services were in operation by end 2016 to provide

reliable and safe transportation mode to the people

who travel in late nights and early mornings.

Accordingly, steps were taken to recommence 29

late-night intercity trips that initiate from the Central

Bus Station in Colombo during 2016.

The financial performance of the SLTB

improved moderately during 2016. The total

revenue of the SLTB, at Rs. 40.9 billion, registered

an increase of 14.2 per cent in 2016 in comparison

to the previous year. Passenger fares, which

account for about 65.6 per cent of the total revenue,

registered an increase of 7.4 per cent in 2016

in comparison to 2015. Operating expenditure

also increased by 3.6 per cent to Rs. 42.0 billion.

Consequently, SLTB incurred an operating loss of

Rs. 1.1 billion in comparison to an operating loss of

Rs. 4.7 billion reported in 2015.

Several measures were undertaken to

enhance the efficiency of state owned bus

services in 2016, though substantial reforms

within both the public and private bus

transportation sectors are necessary to provide

a cost effective, reliable and safe transport

mode for the general public. At the end of 2016,

the number of electronic ticket machines available

at the SLTB was 7,500 machines, while around

3,800 new machines were purchased during the

year under review. In this regard, Rs. 115.0 million

was allocated for purchasing of new electronic

machines. Meanwhile, feasibility studies were

undertaken to strengthen the SLTB and railway

coordinated services. Currently, individual public

transport modes are operating independently with

very limited inter-modal connectivity. The efficiency

of the overall transport system diminishes due to

this lack of interconnectedness. Consequently,

commuters tend to use their own private transport

modes, particularly in urban areas, leading to

heavy traffic congestions, fuel wastage and

environmental pollution. Therefore, interconnected

transport services, preferably based on integrated

network schedules along with integrated ticketing,

sales and marketing of different transport modes,

will improve the overall service delivery. However,

this requires strong co-operation and co-ordination

among various institutions involved in providing

transport facilities in the country. Further, necessary

parking facilities should also be established at various

transport hubs such as railway stations, in order to

link the home of the commuter and the transport hub.

The registration of motor vehicles

slowed down in 2016. The revision of taxes

on motor vehicle imports, depreciation of the

domestic currency against the US dollar, the

macro-prudential measures implemented by the

Central Bank and the gradual increase in interest

rates have contributed to the deceleration in

registration of new vehicles. In 2015, the Central

Bank imposed a macro-prudential measure in

the form of a Loan to Value ratio of 70 per cent in

respect of loans and advances granted by banks

and financial institutions for the purchase of motor

vehicles. The macro-prudential measure was

aimed at limiting the number of new vehicle imports

into the country. Consequently, the number of new

vehicles, which registered a substantial increase

of 55.7 per cent in 2015, declined significantly by

26.2 per cent to 493,328 in 2016. Registration of

all vehicle categories, excluding goods transport

vehicles and land vehicles, recorded a negative

growth in 2016. Meanwhile, the registration of dual

purpose vehicles and three wheelers declined

by 31.9 per cent and 56.0 per cent, respectively,

and the registration of motor cars declined by

57.2 per cent in comparison to the preceding

year. New registration of buses also witnessed a

35.1 per cent decline during 2016 relative to 2015.

Rail Transportation

The Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) recorded

a gradual improvement in its operational

activities in 2016. Rail passenger kilometrage

increased marginally by 0.1 per cent to 7,413

million km in 2016 in comparison to 7,407 million

km in 2015, supported by relatively low tariffs,

increased road traffic and the expansion of railway

services to the Northern Province. Meanwhile,

the goods kilometrage increased by 7.6 per cent

to 140 million MT km in 2016 from 130 million

MT km in 2015 mainly due to the commencement

of the transportation of coal, and increased oil and

cement transportation.

Several measures were taken to improve

railway infrastructure in 2016. The SLR took

steps to replace new bridges under the Belgium

Bridge Project (BBP) with financial assistance

from the Belgium government. Under this project,

three bridges at Wellawatta, Angulana and

Katugoda were replaced in 2016 and four more

bridges are expected to be replaced in 2017.

Initiatives have been taken by the SLR to conduct

a feasibility study in collaboration with the ADB for

the Colombo Suburban Railway Project (CSRP),

which aims at improving railway services in the

Capital City of Colombo and its suburbs. Under

the CSRP, a feasibility study on a railway track

between Veyangoda to Panadura is underway

to improve the capacity and operating speed by

modernising and upgrading the tracks, improving

signalling and telecommunication infrastructure,

and electrifying the suburban railway lines. The

CSRP is expected to facilitate the procurement of

fast and modern commuter trains and modernise

the rolling stock maintenance facilities and upgrade

selected railway stations to provide improved

intermodal connectivity with other modes of public

transport. Further, initiatives were taken by the

SLR in 2016 to commence transporting coal from

Trincomalee to Norochcholai with the Lanka Coal

Company (Pvt) Limited under a PPP agreement.

Meanwhile, the SLR introduced rail buses for

Kandy-Peradeniya and Kelani Valley lines in 2016.

In addition, the SLR started to procure a number of

new rolling stock with the view to strengthening rail

travel in relation to other modes of transportation.

Since road transportation is often subject to heavy

traffic congestion, leading to energy wastage and

increased losses of man-hours, it is highly necessary

to introduce alternative modes of transportation in

the period ahead. Hence, modernisation of the

existing railway system, enhancing of the railroad

coverage and improvements in the efficiency and

reliability of railway services are essential to meet

the increasing demand for transportation.

The financial position of the SLR moderately

improved during 2016. The total revenue of

the SLR increased by 4.6 per cent to Rs. 6.6

billion, while current expenditure decreased by

4.6 per cent to Rs. 13.4 billion, benefitting from

low oil prices. The increase in revenue and the

reduction in expenditure resulted in reducing

operating losses of the SLR to Rs. 6.8 billion in

2016 from a loss of Rs. 7.7 billion in 2015. Capital

expenditure of the SLR also witnessed a decline of

48.4 per cent to Rs. 15.7 billion in 2016 from

Rs. 30.4 billion in the previous year, mainly due

to the completion of the expansion of railway

services in the Northern Province. In the meantime,

the government decided to keep the rail tariff

unchanged in 2016.

Civil Aviation

The civil aviation sector showed a

considerable growth momentum in 2016. The air

passenger movements through the Bandaranaike

International Airport (BIA) increased by

11.9 per cent to 9.5 million passengers in 2016

owing to the increase in tourist arrivals. In 2016,

the BIA handled 4.9 million arriving passengers

and 4.7 million departing passengers, inclusive

of 1.4 million transit passengers. Further, the BIA

handled 64,693 aircraft movements that consisted

of 58,790 scheduled movements and 5,903

unscheduled movements. The total cargo handling

at the BIA was 253,941 MT in 2016, which is an

18.1 per cent increase in comparison to the previous

year. During 2016, BIA’s flight network was further

expanded with the commencements of commercial

flights of Himalaya Airlines, Ukraine International

Airlines as well as with the resumption of KLM

Royal Dutch Airlines flights to Colombo. Mattala

Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) handled

916 aircraft movements in 2016 in comparison

to the 884 aircraft handled in the preceding year.

Throughout the year, 4,772 passengers used

the MRIA in comparison to 2,739 passengers in

2015. There were 37 international airlines in the

civil aviation sector, including nine charter airlines,

SLA and three cargo lines, while seven domestic

airlines were in operation by the end of 2016. Mihin

Lanka Airlines ceased its operations in October

2016 and SLA took over Mihin Lanka’s schedule by

upgrading all routes to full service operations from

the budget flight operations.

The SLA incurred an operating loss of

Rs. 14.1 billion in 2016 in comparison to a

loss of Rs. 4.9 billion in 2015, mainly due to

higher costs related to aircraft maintenance

and lease. In 2016, the SLA replaced its last

four-engine Airbus A340 aircraft that was used for

two decades with two fuel efficient, modern, brand

new, twin-engine A330-300 aircraft. In addition,

two aircraft of Mihin Lanka were also absorbed

to the SLA fleet. In 2016, the SLA had to incur

the full maintenance and lease costs of the fleet

introduced in 2015, leading to a higher operating

expenditure and substantial operating losses in

2016 in comparison to 2015. By end 2016, the

fleet of the SLA comprised 13 wide body aircraft

and eight narrow body aircraft. This includes seven

A330-300s, six A330-200s, six A320s and two A321

aircraft. Maintaining a massive loss making airline,

which is funded through the government cash flow,

is a huge burden to the government budget. Hence,

the measures taken towards securing a strategic

partner have to be accomplished to resolve the

need for capital injection and debt consolidation

and thereby remove the burden on the government

budget.

Plans were underway to renovate and expand

the BIA to improve the facilities at the airport

and curb the capacity constraints. During the first

half of 2016, bids were called for the overlaying of

the BIA’s runway to improve the surface condition

of the runway and safe operation of aircraft. This

project consisted of widening and overlaying the

existing runway, overlaying of the northern part of

the existing parallel taxiway, widening of existing

taxiways, construction of new rapid exit taxiways

and new bypass taxiways, installation of new

airfield ground lighting system, and modification

of the existing apron of the aerodrome of the BIA.

The BIA runway was closed from 06 January 2017

to 05 April 2017 between 8.30 am to 4.30 pm for the

resurfacing activities. However, all possible flights

were rescheduled within the revised operational

hours. As a result, only 8.6 per cent of the flights

to the BIA operated by the foreign airlines and

17.3 per cent of the SLA flights had to be cancelled

during the period of runway resurfacing. In addition,

the construction of the second terminal at the BIA

is planned to commence in 2017 and will continue

till 2020 with an investment of Japanese Yen

45,428 million. A concessionary loan agreement

was signed in March 2016 between the Airport

and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited (AASL)

and the Japan International Cooporation Agency

(JICA) to construct a multi-level terminal building

with two pier passenger terminals, where arrivals

and departures are separated vertically. Upon

completion of the construction of the second

terminal at the BIA, the current capacity of 6 million

passenger movements per annum would increase

to 15 million.

Port Services

The overall performance of port related

services, which consists of handling containers,

transshipments and cargo, improved in 2016,

mainly supported by the increased operations

at the Colombo International Container Terminal

(CICT) and South Asia Gateway Terminal

(SAGT). The total container handling in 2016

increased by 10.6 per cent to 5.7 million twenty

foot equivalent container units (TEUs), from 5.2

million TEUs handled in 2015. The CICT handled

mega container vessels that cannot be operated

either at the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) of the

Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) or SAGT. Container

handling at the CICT and SAGT in 2016 increased by

28.2 per cent and 19.0 per cent, respectively, in

comparison to that of the preceding year. However,

container handling at the JCT and Unity Container

Terminal (UCT), which are fully owned by the SLPA,

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

recorded a negative growth of 6.8 per cent in 2016

in comparison to 2015. The total transshipment

container handling recorded an 11.8 per cent growth

during 2016 relative to the previous year. At the same

time, total cargo handling registered a growth of

11.5 per cent to 86.5 million MT in 2016, in

comparison to the growth of 4.3 per cent recorded

in the previous year. Growth in total cargo handling

was mainly supported by the cargo handling at CICT

and SAGT at the Port of Colombo, which witnessed a

growth of 26.6 per cent and 25.5 per cent, respectively.

Cargo handling at the terminals of the SLPA registered

a negative growth of 1.8 per cent in 2016 in comparison

to the preceding year.

Several measures were undertaken during

2016 to develop ports in Sri Lanka in order to

exploit the country’s potential as a maritime

hub in the South Asian region. The ADB and

the SLPA signed a transaction advisory services

agreement in February 2016 to develop the East

Container Terminal (ECT) of the Colombo Port as

a PPP. The pre-qualification process of this PPP

commenced with the public announcement for

Expressions of Interest (EOI) in June 2016. The

government is currently in the process of evaluating

the EOI applications with the assistance of the ADB.

Meanwhile, the construction work of the Colombo

Financial City, which was earlier named as Colombo

Port City Project (CPCP), was restarted in March

2016. The Ministry of Megapolis and Western

Development has allocated around Rs. 94 million

in 2017 to develop the infrastructure facilities of the

proposed port city development project. Meanwhile,

the SLPA has taken steps to prepare a master plan

for national ports of Sri Lanka with the assistance of

the ADB, aimed at developing the port infrastructure

in an optimum manner considering the industries and

hinterland economy, multimodal transport networks,

harmonisation with urban development as well as

future port developments. The master plan covers

all ports, including the restructuring of the SLPA, and

addresses emerging business activities in oil and gas

handling, passenger and cruise ship operations as

well as transport sector development plans.

Additional investments under a PPP are

required to fully exploit the locational advantage

of the Hambantota Port. The Hambantota Port is

located at the intersection of major international

shipping routes within the world’s busiest maritime

transportation lanes. The Hambantota Port

development was initiated with the objective of

developing it as an industrial port, given the land

availability in the area, geographical location and

developed road networks. One of the key reasons

for poor performance of the Hambantota Port is the

lack of sufficient hinterland industries that augment

port activities. Therefore, measures taken to attract

FDI to set up factories and industries around the

Hambantota Port through a viable PPP mechanism

would enhance the performance of the Hambantota

port allowing it to exploit its full potential as an industrial

port. The financial performance of the Hambantota

Port has been weak since the commencement of port

operations in 2010. In 2016, the Hambantota port

registered a loss of Rs. 10.9 billion before taxes, in

comparison to the loss of Rs. 18.8 billion before taxes

recorded in 2015. The poor financial performance

of the Hambantota Port has threatened the financial

viability of the project and affected the overall financial

progress of the SLPA. Therefore, a PPP is imperative

to develop a viable business model and ensure the

efficient management of the port.

The financial performance of the SLPA

improved in 2016. As per the provisional financial

statements, the SLPA recorded a profit of Rs. 1.0

billion in 2016 before taxes, in comparison to the loss

of Rs. 14.2 billion before taxes recorded in 2015.

The total revenue of the SLPA in 2016 has grown by

7.0 per cent to Rs. 43.0 billion, while the operating

expenditure has declined by 7.5 per cent to

Rs. 28.7 billion in comparison to the preceding year.

However, since the SLPA has a substantial amount

of foreign debt, the financial performance of the

SLPA is significantly affected by the exchange

rate movements. In 2016, the profit before

foreign exchange losses stood at Rs. 11.1

billion, while the foreign exchange loss was

Rs. 10.0 billion. Conversely, the profit before

the foreign exchange losses was recorded as

Rs. 6.0 billion in 2015, but the foreign exchange loss

amounted to Rs. 20.2 billion. The foreign exchange

losses arise due to the increase in rupee value of

the foreign currency denominated liabilities caused

by domestic currency depreciation.

Water Supply and Irrigation

The water supply and drainage sector

witnessed a remarkable improvement in 2016,

benefitting from the rising demand for pipe

borne water connections. The National Water

Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB) supplied

138,750 new water connections for domestic,

commercial and industrial purposes, reaching

2.1 million total connections by end 2016. With this,

the total number of water connections increased by

7.1 per cent in 2016 over the previous year.

Accessibility to pipe borne water through large

and medium scale water supply schemes

managed by the NWS&DB also increased to

47.7 per cent of the total population in 2016,

from 45.9 per cent in 2015. Meanwhile, the

percentage of island-wide non-revenue water

decreased to 25.6 per cent in 2016, from

27.3 per cent in 2015. Further, the percentage

of non-revenue water in the Colombo city

decreased to 45.7 per cent in 2016, from

46.2 per cent in 2015. While coverage levels and

the service quality of water supply have improved

significantly over the past decade, the need for water

services has outstripped the government's ability to

provide sufficient water and sanitation to the public

and ensure equitable access to those services

throughout the country. Addressing this need, the

NWS&DB has commenced 13 new projects in 2016

with financial facilities from both local and foreign

funding sources, aimed at providing safe drinking

water to public. Meanwhile, the NWS&DB has planned

to initiate six new water supply projects covering

North-Central, Sabaragamuwa, Western, Uva and

Southern Provinces, targeting around 375,915

beneficiaries in 2017. Further, the NWS&DB has

continued its work to reduce the incidence of

water borne diseases through several projects, by

addressing the issue of pollution in rivers and street

drains.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

The financial position of NWS&DB has

improved in 2016. As per unaudited provisional

financial statements, the NWS&DB has recorded an

operational profit of Rs. 1,733 million, in comparison

to an operational loss of Rs. 65 million recorded

in 2015. Total revenue grew by 17.5 per cent to

Rs. 25.1 billion mainly due to the increased number

of connections provided during the year, while

operational and maintenance costs increased

by 9.1 per cent to Rs. 23.3 billion. Further, the

NWS&DB incurred a capital expenditure of

Rs. 32.7 billion, which is an increase of 18.7 per cent

in comparison to the previous year. Meanwhile, as

per the Budget proposal 2016, the Public Utilities

Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) prepared an action

plan to strengthen its regulation on the NWS&DB and

submitted this to the Ministry of City Planning and

Water Supply for implementation.

The government continued its active role of

improving the irrigation system of the country

with the aim of increasing agricultural

production and productivity. To this end, funds

were allocated for 20 major irrigation schemes to

ensure the provision of required water supply for

agriculture activities in major cultivation areas.

Meanwhile, the Climate Resilience Improvement

Project (CRIP), which was initiated in 2014 by

the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources

Management with a view to mitigating the adverse

impacts of climate change and developing

infrastructure that withstand extreme climate

shocks, continued in 2016, covering 21 major

irrigation schemes in nine districts of the country.

Under the CRIP-Additional Financing Project, plans

are underway to rehabilitate 25 major irrigation

schemes in eight districts. The CRIP mainly

focuses on establishing a process that would

build a more climate resilient economy, since the

current knowledge on the impact of climate, flood

and drought modelling and scenario analysis are

not adequate. The government allocated funds

amounting to Rs.11.2 billion for the rehabilitation

of 20 major existing irrigation schemes in 2016.

During the year, the Irrigation Department spent

Rs. 8.3 billion on major irrigation schemes, which

is a decrease of 4.4 per cent from the previous

year. The expenditure incurred on major irrigation

schemes during the year included Rs. 5.7

billion invested on the Yan Oya Reservoir and

Rs. 0.6 billion spent on the Deduru Oya Reservoir.

Nevertheless, the country requires additional water

storage facilities to cope with the erratic weather

pattern, which has affected crop cultivation and

hydropower generation in the recent period.

Hence, it is necessary to de-silt existing reservoirs

in order to enhance the storage capacity of existing

reservoirs and minimise the negative implications

originating from both flood and drought conditions.

the public. As per the provisional data, there was

one qualified doctor for every 1,036 persons and

one nurse for every 652 persons in state hospitals

by end 2016. Further, as at end 2016, there were

598 hospitals with 3.6 beds for every 1,000 persons

in the state health sector. Numerous physical

infrastructure development projects in relation to the

state-managed health sector were in progress

during 2016. The improvements in emergency

treatment units managed by the line-ministry

hospitals, construction of a state-of-the-art cancer

ward complex at the National Institute of Cancer

in Maharagama, development of an ambulatory

care centre at the National Hospital of Sri

Lanka, development of the clinical building and

out-patient departmental complex at the district

general hospital in Kalutara, extension of the

pre-mature baby unit at De Soyza maternity hospital

and the development of estate sector hospitals are

some of the infrastructure development projects

that were in progress during 2016.

Although Sri Lanka has been successful

in mitigating certain communicable diseases,

the country still faces numerous challenges

in curtailing several other communicable

diseases such as Dengue. Sri Lanka was

certified as a Malaria free country by the World

Health Organisation (WHO) in September 2016,

following the successful completion of three

consecutive years without reporting a single

indigenous Malaria case. This WHO certification

has been granted subsequent to a rigorous

country-wide evaluation of the absence of

indigenous transmission of Malaria, particularly

in the remote and former Malaria prone areas,

and by assessing the capacity of the country’s

healthcare system to prevent a recurrence.

Although there were 41 imported Malaria cases

reported by tourists, especially from India,

Pakistan and African countries during 2016, the

Anti-Malaria Campaign has extended prompt

service by providing diagnostic and treatment

facilities free of charge to both government and

private hospitals. In addition, the WHO declared

Sri Lanka as a country that has eliminated

Lymphatic Filariasis in 2016, since Sri Lanka

has reached the required target microfilaria rate

of less than one per cent. However, Dengue

continues to be a major public health hazard at

present. During 2016, a total of 55,150 Dengue

cases was reported from the entire country,

which corresponds to a rate of 260 cases per

100,000 population. In 2015, the incidence of

Dengue was 142 cases per 100,000 population.

The increase in the number of Dengue cases

in 2016 can be mainly attributed to extreme

environmental and weather conditions that

prevailed during the year. The Ministry of Health,

Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine (MOH) has

implemented numerous activities to minimise

the incidence of Dengue Haemorrhagic fever by

early diagnosis and proactive case management

while conducting a series of source reduction

programmes and two national Dengue control

weeks. Consequently, despite the high number

of Dengue cases reported in the year, the

fatality rate from Dengue has been limited to

0.16 per cent. Meanwhile, country-wide

surveillance programmes and early diagnosis

and treatment programmes were carried

out in relation to many other communicable

diseases such as Tuberculosis, Zika, Japanese

Encephalitis and Leptospirosis. Further, a

total of 527 health education and awareness

programmes has been conducted in relation

to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and

Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) during

2016 and 4,532 HIV tests have been performed

in the country through rapid HIV testing and

reach activities among More-At-Risk-Populations

(MARPs).

Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown

aetiology (CKDu) continues to be a serious

public health issue for Sri Lanka.1 In order to

address this serious health hazard, the MOH

has expanded the number of sentinel sites in

the national CKDu surveillance programme

from 30 to 50 hospitals during 2016. Necessary

infrastructure development and staff training were

completed in the newly established sentinel sites.

Meanwhile, the 'National Renal Registry', which

is a web-based real-time patient registration

system especially for the CKD/CKDu patients,

has expanded and approximately 5,500 new

CKD patients have been registered in this system

during the year under review. With the consensus

of technical experts, the screening guidelines

for CKD in Sri Lanka were revised during 2016

and health staff were trained according to the

new set of guidelines. In addition, the water

quality assessment laboratory in Anuradhapura

was upgraded during 2016 with new chemical

analysers that can detect heavy metals in water.

This laboratory will be fully functional in 2017.

1 The geographical distribution of CKDu indicates that, all areas of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts, Polpithigama and Giribawa Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions in the North Western Province, Dehiatthakandiya and Padavi Sripura DS divisions in the Eastern Province, Mahiyanganya and Rideemaliyadda DS divisions in the Uva Province and Welioya, Vavuniya and Vavuniya South DS divisions in the North Province and Wilgamuwa DS division in the Central Province are high risk areas for CKDu. Source: MOH

Given the increasing geographical distribution

of CKDu prevalence and the serious economic

implications of this disease on already poor rural

households, it is crucial to strengthen and expedite

the efforts of the government, health officials and

non-governmental organisations to curtail this

health issue. In this regard, provision of clean

drinking water to persons in affected areas,

improving facilities for early detection of the

disease and surveillance, enhancing treatment

facilities for CKDu for hospitals in high risk areas,

expediting research work on the root cause of

CKDu and intensive region-wide programmes for

pollution prevention and environmental protection

are necessary.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) have

emerged as a challenge for the Sri Lankan health

sector with socio-economic, demographic

and life-style transitions occurring in the

country. The MOH continued to strengthen

primary care facilities to treat the chronic NCD

patients while providing treatments through the

essential drug policy. The National Policy on

Chronic NCD Prevention focuses on four major

shared modifiable risk factors that potentially

cause NCDs: smoking, alcohol, obesity, and

unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyles. The

strategies for reducing these risk factors are

implemented through the existing health network

with the assistance of both government and

non-governmental organisations in the country.

During 2016, the MOH decided to include pictorial

warnings covering 80 per cent of the cigarette

packet with the aim of developing a high level

of awareness of the health risks, suffering and

disfigurements caused by tobacco among all

categories of age. Further, compulsory colour

coding of beverages to indicate their sugar

content was also introduced in 2016. The public

awareness created by these programmes on

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

115

healthy food choices is essential to prevent

NCDs. Accordingly, the MOH plans to launch a

social marketing campaign on the prevention and

control of NCDs and conduct health promotion

programmes for children from Grade 6 to 9,

by distributing 1 million booklets. Further, the

MOH plans to initially establish health corners

at 400 schools to educate the children on being

conscious about their Body Mass Index (BMI),

diet and physical activities. Prevention of injuries

also has been a focal point of the NCD Unit. Injury

prevention strategies of the NCD Unit involve

planning of programmes, developing guidelines

and policies to prevent almost all types of injuries

that could occur during one’s lifetime, covering

all ages from infancy to adulthood. Accordingly,

an injury surveillance programme was launched

in base and above hospitals in Sri Lanka in June

2016. In addition, a social media campaign and

several public awareness programmes were also

conducted to create public awareness on injury

prevention.

During the period under review, the private

sector participation in healthcare service

delivery continued to expand. By end 2016,

there were 225 private hospitals, with a total

bed capacity of 6,330, administering western

medicine. In addition, there were 22 Ayurvedic

private hospitals with a total of 326 beds. As

at end 2016, there were 26 private medical

ambulance services, 146 full-time private dental

surgeries, 521 full-time general practices/

dispensaries/ medical clinics, 24 full-time medical

specialist practices, 967 medical laboratories

and 502 medical centres/ screening centres/

day-care medical centres/ channel consultations

registered under the MOH. In 2016, the MOH,

in collaboration with the Private Health Services

Regulatory Council and the National Apprentice

and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), initiated

the conduct of refresher/ gap filling courses for

nurses and dental surgery assistants, who are

currently employed at private hospitals, medical

centres and dental surgery practices. With

increased demand for healthcare and screening

for NCDs, the private sector plays a critically

important role in providing healthcare services

in the country. Nevertheless, it is important to

regulate private healthcare providers to ensure

the maintenance of appropriate and consistent

standards, and safe practices of healthcare

delivery.

Education

Quality and equitable access to primary and

secondary education for all children is essential

for the economic and social development

of the country. According to the Ministry of

Education, the student Net Enrolment Ratio

(NER) of the age group of 5 to 14 years stood at

97.35 per cent, whereas NER for male and

female student categories was 98.38 per cent and

96.31 per cent, respectively in 2016. Conversely,

the gross survival rate through Grade 1 to Grade

112, which measures the school participation,

increased to 86.54 per cent during 2016, from

2 The gross survival rate through Grade 1 to Grade 11 is the proportion of students who are currently studying in Grade 11 as a percentage of the total students who enrolled in Grade 1 ten years ago.

85.09 per cent in 2014. The survival rate to

Grade 11 of male and female students stood at

83.31 per cent and 89.9 per cent, respectively.

The Western Province recorded the highest gross

school survival rate of 92.21 per cent and the lowest

levels were recorded for the Eastern Province

(75.59 per cent) and the Northern Province

(79.91 per cent). The gross survival rate through

Grade 1 to Grade 11 is particularly low among

the male students in the Eastern Province

(71.59 per cent) and the Northern Province

(75.36 per cent). The low gross survival rate in the

Eastern and Northern Provinces is a consequence

of severe poverty levels prevailing in these areas

that compel the children, particularly the male

students, to drop-out from schools and seek

employment in order to contribute to the household

income. However, the lack of proper education

reduces the employability of these children that can

lead to pockets of poverty in these regions.

The Ministry of Education has taken several

steps in 2016 to improve school participation

levels. With the objective of improving survival

rates in education, a new education policy proposal

has been introduced by the Ministry of Education

in 2016 to provide 13 years of mandatory

education for all children, where education meet

the aptitudes and expectations of the students as

well as job market requirements. In addition, the

Ministry of Education conducted several capacity

development programmes for the principles,

deputy principles and teachers targeting the law

performance education zones, such as the Northern

Province, to enhance their knowledge and teaching

capacity. Further, free vouchers were provided to

approximately 4.3 million school children in 10,145

schools to purchase school uniforms. In addition,

the Ministry of Education has spent Rs. 4.0 billion

on the mid-day meal programme, which benefitted

973,245 students from 6,946 schools. Further,

the World Food Programme implemented in the

Northern Province benefitted 162,272 students in

965 schools. However, an incentive programme

for school participation, targeting the children of

low-income households, is necessary to improve

the school survival rates, especially in the rural and

estate sectors.

The Ministry of Education in 2016

implemented several measures to reduce

the disparity in general education for school

children throughout the country. The concept

of ‘Nearest school is the best school’ has been

introduced by the Ministry of Education to provide

equal opportunities in education for all students,

irrespective of the region or the school type.

Under the ‘1000 secondary schools development’

project, 995 technological laboratories have

been constructed, out of which 961 laboratories

were functioning by the end of 2016. In addition,

technology faculty buildings are proposed to be

constructed in selected 251 secondary schools.

Accordingly, 226 technology faculties have been

constructed, out of which 216 faculties were in

function by the end of the year under review. Under

the ‘Sanitation First’ programme, which aims to

improve the sanitary and water facilities in selected

1,166 schools, the construction work of sanitary

facilities in 908 schools have been completed by

the end of 2016. In addition, several infrastructure

development activities were carried out during the

year to enhance the physical condition of public

schools.

Improving the quality of general education

is crucial for the personal and professional

development of individuals, and thereby

generate a productive labour force for the

future. Accordingly, teacher training programmes

to improve the teaching quality in primary and

secondary schools were conducted in 2016 by

the Ministry of Education. Several programmes

were conducted through seven Teacher Training

Colleges to improve the teaching capacity.

Meanwhile, 45,000 teachers were trained

through 109 teacher training centres, using

short-term teacher development workshops and

teacher professional training programmes. In 2013,

the Technology subject stream was introduced for

the GCE Advanced Level through 251 schools.

While recognising the importance of scientific

literacy and mathematic skills for knowledge

generation, and discovery and innovation, the

Ministry of Education has implemented several

training programmes for teachers in the Science

and Mathematics subjects. Furthermore, exposure

to ICT from the primary and secondary school level

is important to develop technological adaptability

among children, which in turn enhances their

career opportunities and employability in the future.

During the year under review, 300 ICT graduate

teachers and 200 teachers that passed out from

the National Colleges of Education were further

trained by the National Institute of Education on

teaching ICT at the school level. Meanwhile, the

construction work of five new Zonal ICT centres in

several districts were completed, while eight are in

progress. In addition, the Ministry of Education with

the assistance of the ICTA, which is functioning

under the Ministry of Telecommunication and

Digital Infrastructure, has planned to introduce

digital education system by establishing digital

classrooms with smart devices. A pilot programme

will be conducted from 2016 to 2018 by establishing

300 digital classrooms in 150 schools.

The non-state participation in primary and

secondary education continued to increase in

2016. During the year under review, there were 105

private schools (excluding international schools)

and 754 Pirivenas functioning in the country. The

total number of students in private schools (excluding

international schools) increased to 136,407 in 2016,

from 136,228 in the previous year. The number of

students enrolled in Pirivenas was 66,003 during

2016. Currently, the government approved private

schools are under the supervision of provincial

and zonal authorities. However, the regulation,

supervision and monitoring of international schools

are not under the purview of the Ministry of Education

or the provincial or zonal authorities. At present, the

number of students enrolled in international schools

is on the rise and it is important to have some

mechanism to regulate and monitor these schools

to ensure the quality of education provided by these

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

118

institutes. However, the regulation and monitoring

of international schools by the government should

not hinder the smooth functioning of high-standard

international schools.

Recognising the importance of meeting

requirements in the labour market in a

knowledge driven economy, the Ministry

of Higher Education and Highways and the

University Grants Commission (UGC) have

taken several initiatives in 2016 to uplift the

university education in terms of quality and

quantity. The UGC admitted 28,952 students to

the state universities for the 2015/2016 academic

year through the normal and special intakes,

based on the results of GCE (A/L) examination

held in 2015. During the year, the UGC finalised

the admission of 1,333 students through special

provision for the 2014/2015 academic year,

based on the results of GCE (A/L)-2014. Further,

38 undergraduate degree programmes and 15

post-graduate degree programmes were

approved by the UGC during 2016. In addition,

nine new faculties, 34 new departments and

three new centres were established within the

public universities during the year. However,

the successive governments have identified

that the limited resources in the existing 17 state

universities are not sufficient to provide higher

education opportunities to a large number of the

student population. Therefore, the government has

taken measures to allow private investors to invest

in higher education and establish Non-State Higher

Education Institutes (NSHEIs), which offer degree

programmes. These NSHEIs are important to

minimise the foreign currency outflows caused by

domestic students who enrol in foreign universities

and to attract foreign inflows via enrolling foreign

students in these NSHEIs. As of end 2016, 17

NSHEIs have been recognised as degree awarding

institutes by the Ministry of Higher Education,

while 96 accredited local degree programmes

are offered by these institutes. According to the

Ministry of Higher Education, more than 4,000

students annually enrol in these recognised degree

programmes conducted by NSHEIs. Further,

around 11,500 students were following local degree

programmes in 15 degree awarding NSHEIs in

2016. Further, approximately 7,000 students have

enrolled for affiliated degrees offered by these

NSHEIs. However, NSHEIs need to be accountable

for their social responsibility in providing education

services while attaining profit making objectives.

Maintaining the quality of education provided by

the NSHEIs is essential to meet the expectations of

enrolled students as well as to produce right skilled

labour, who can contribute to the economy. Hence,

while encouraging private investments in the

higher education sector, it is crucial to monitor the

quality of the degree programmes offered by these

private institutions and the accreditation of degree

programmes. In order to fulfil this long-felt need,

the Ministry of Higher Education is in the process of

drafting a bill to establish a ‘Quality Assurance and

Accreditation Commission’, which will regulate all

the higher education institutions.

The Technical and Vocational Education

and Training (TVET) sector continued to

provide educational opportunities to a large

number of students by offering career specific

educational programmes to meet the dynamic

labour market requirements. The expansion

of the TVET sector is important to provide

educational opportunities to the students who miss

the opportunity of secondary or tertiary education

through schools and state universities and to

cater to their different expectations, skills and

aptitudes. By the end of 2016, the TVET sector

consisted of 313 public institutions and 451 private

and non-governmental institutions providing

2,656 accredited courses in relation to a wide

array of subjects, such as automobile repair and

maintenance, building and construction, electrical,

electronics and telecommunications, finance,

banking and management, food technology, ICT

and multimedia, textile and garments, leather and

footwear and refrigeration and air-conditioning.

The Technology subject stream introduced for

the GCE Advanced Level enables the students to

build a link between their secondary and tertiary

education through the TVETs, even if they miss the

opportunity of university entrance. At the same time,

in order to minimise the possible negative impact

relating to scarcity of skilled labour, the government

has allocated around Rs. 500 million to train 10,000

personnel through the NAITA, Sri Lanka Vocational

Training Authority (SLVTA) and the Department of

Technical Education and Training (DTET). Under

these training programmes, 9,306 youths have been

registered at the NAITA for training at model projects of

the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA)

and construction projects of major contractors.

Housing and Urban Development

The government continued to implement

several housing development programmes

with the aim of enhancing the living standards

of low and middle income groups in the

country. The NHDA and the Urban Settlement

Development Authority (USDA) continued to play

an important role in providing housing facilities to

meet the increasing demand from low and middle

income groups. In this regard, the Ministry of

Finance has allocated around Rs. 6,432.0 million in

2016. In line with this, the Ministry of Housing and

Construction has initiated a number of new housing

development projects, such as scattered housing

programme, houses for families of CKDu patients,

housing programme for widows, reawakened

villages programme, Welioya special project,

Sevana villages housing programme, Sampath

Sevana housing programme, and middle class

housing programme, through the NHDA and Urban

Development Authority (UDA). During 2016, the

NHDA completed around 101,729 housing units,

of which 7,559 units were newly built. Further,

the NHDA implemented a programme to grant

title deeds and deeds of lease to beneficiaries.

Accordingly, around 1,851 title deeds and 7,599

deeds of lease have been granted during 2016.

Meanwhile, the NHDA and USDA planned to

increase the housing stock through various

programmes targeting the low-income and middle

income groups who undergo immense difficulties

in the absence of a house of their own. The

construction work under the Lindula and Chilaw

housing development programmes was completed

in 2016, while construction of 356 housing units was

in progress under the Lunawa housing project by

the USDA. Further, the USDA implemented several

human development programmes, including

establishment of the Swashakthi community based

organisations, empowering women of underserved

settlements, and conducting community action

workshops, covering Colombo, Hambantota,

Kalutara, Trincomalee, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala,

Galle and Ampara districts, to uplift the living

conditions of the low income communities. The

responsibility of coordination with regard to ongoing

housing projects in the Hambantota district was

also entrusted to the USDA.

Several policy measures were taken in 2016

with a view to providing access to sustainable

housing for low income households. Steps

were taken to revise the national housing policy to

reflect the vision of the government while focusing

on mitigating the impact of natural disasters and

implementing the concept of sustainable human

settlement development. Meanwhile, the absence

of reliable and updated data and information on the

current housing needs of the country posed a major

problem to the Ministry of Housing and Construction

in making policy decisions and planning in order

to meet the housing requirements of the country.

Therefore, steps were taken to conduct a survey at

the Divisional Secretariat level, to collect data on the

housing needs of all Grama Niladhari divisions' level

covering the entire country. Thus far, the Ministry of

Housing and Construction has received data from 315

Divisional Secretariat Divisions out of 331 Divisions

that have been surveyed. According to the current

findings of the survey, around 2.4 million families

will be in need of a new house in the future, due to

various reasons, such as poor condition of existing

houses, and permanent and temporary migration

to other areas of the country, while around 1 million

families are in need of infrastructure facilities, such as

electricity, sanitary facilities and road access.

The UDA continued to play an important

role in improving housing facilities of people

in urban underserved settlements while being

actively involved in the development of urban

infrastructure. During 2016, the UDA completed

266 housing units under the Siyasetha Sevana

housing programme, while the construction

of 12,963 housing units was in progress. The

development of the Colombo Fort-Pedestrian

web and the construction of relocation shops

commenced during 2016 with the objective of

improving the utilisation of lands, which are currently

not in use due to unorganised development, for

organised activities. The UDA continued its priority

investments on developing major towns under

its town development programmes. Accordingly,

several town development projects, such as

drainage and land development, town centre

development, road development and construction

of multi-storied car park, commercial complexes,

and public markets, were in progress during 2016.

Urbanisation, if managed properly,

fosters businesses and industries, provides

employment and high income opportunities

to the residents, including migrants from rural

areas, while ensuring the general wellbeing

of individuals. Therefore, urban transition is

considered as one of the major challenges to a

developing country, requiring massive expansion

in urban infrastructure and services. Currently,

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

121

many areas in Sri Lanka are undergoing rapid

urbanisation, leading to a higher demand for

infrastructure. Therefore, as urbanisation is taking

place, the demand for infrastructure in the form of

housing, efficient transportation networks, parking

facilities, traffic management, health facilities,

water supply and drainage, sanitation facilities,

waste management, sustained energy supplies

and recreational amenities, such as parks, facilities

for leisure and physical activities will also increase.

Recognising this growing need, the Ministry

of Megapolis and Western Development has

already commenced various projects, such as the

Western Region Megapolis Master Plan Project,

establishment of strategic cities centralised in

Kandy, Jaffna and Trincomalee, flood mitigation

projects within metropolitan areas, flood control

at Kelani River basin etc. The Megapolis

Project consists of seven city development

projects that include the Colombo Financial City

(Port City) Development Project, Administrative

Capital City in Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte, Science

and Technology City in Homagama-Malabe,

Industrial City in Horana and Mirigama, Aero City

in Katunayake, Plantation City in Avissawella and

Forest City in Baduraliya.

Poverty Alleviation and Safety Nets

Poverty Headcount Ratio (PHCR) in Sri

Lanka has significantly declined in the recent

past, though the spatial distribution of poverty,

moderate poverty and income disparity

remain as obstacles for inclusive economic

development. According to the Household Income

and Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted by the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the

PHCR based on the official poverty line (OPL)

registered 6.7 per cent in 2012/13 in comparison

to 8.9 per cent recorded in 2009/10 and

15.2 per cent in 2006/07. At a provincial level,

the Western Province recorded the lowest level

of PHCR of 2.0 per cent, while the Uva Province

showed the highest level of poverty with a PHCR of

15.4 per cent. At a district level, the lowest PHCR of

1.4 per cent was recorded in the Colombo district,

while the Mullaitivu district recorded the highest

PHCR of 28.8 per cent. Meanwhile, the PHCR in

the estate and rural sector remained at 10.9 per

cent and 7.6 per cent, respectively, while the PHCR

at the urban sector registered a lower level of

2.1 per cent. The spatial distribution of poverty

indicates the existence of severe poverty pockets

in several districts. In addition to Mullaitivu, the

poverty levels in Moneragala, Batticaloa, Mannar,

Badulla and Kilinochchi were fairly high, with PHCR

ratios of 20.8 per cent, 19.4 per cent, 20.1 per cent,

12.3 per cent and 12.7 per cent, respectively.

However, the spatial distribution of poverty indicated

by the high PHCR does not necessarily reflect

the depth of poverty in different areas. Although

the PHCR in Mullaitivu and Mannar are 28.8 per

cent and 20.1 per cent, respectively, these two

districts account for only 3.4 per cent of the poor

population in the country. However, Kurunegala,

which records a PHCR of 6.5 per cent, accounts for

7.6 per cent of the poor population in the country.

Therefore, these regional disparities in poverty

levels pose a considerable challenge for the overall

poverty reduction programme. Further, there is an

urgent need to update the OPL to obtain correct

measurements of poverty in the country. The current

OPL of Rs. 3,624 per person per month for 2012/13

is based on the consumption patterns derived from

HIES-2002, which has been conducted excluding

eight districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces

that account for approximately 13 per cent of the

national population. Hence, HIES-2002 will neither

represent the current consumption patterns nor the

national level consumption patterns. Further, the

OPLs for each HIES years are estimated by inflating

the OPL of 2002 with the Colombo Consumer

Price Index (CCPI). However, the CCPI is based

on retail prices and the consumption patterns of

households in the Colombo district. Therefore, the

CCPI may not reflect the consumption patterns

and retail prices prevailing in other areas. The

international best practice in estimating poverty

is to revise the OPLs on a regular basis to reflect

the dynamic consumption patterns. Considering

the deficiencies in the current OPL of Sri Lanka

and the necessity of adhering to international best

practices, it is important to revise the current OPL

in order to accurately assess the poverty levels

across the country.

According to the World Bank poverty line

(in 2011 Purchasing Power Parity terms),

the extreme poverty in Sri Lanka, i.e., the

percentage of population living below

US dollars 1.90 per day, stood at 1.9 per

cent in 2012/13. Nevertheless, World Bank

statistics suggest that the moderate poverty, i.e.,

percentage of population living below US dollars

3.10 per day in 2011 Purchasing Power Parity terms,

is considerably high in Sri Lanka, which stood at

14.6 per cent in 2012. Although, extreme poverty

is low in Sri Lanka, approximately one eighth of

the population falls in to the ‘nearly poor’ category,

which is defined as the population living above

the World Bank poverty line but below US dollars

3.10 per day (in 2011 Purchasing Power Parity

terms). The economic vulnerability of this ‘near

poor’ people is high, with a higher probability of this

group falling into extreme poverty during vulnerable

situations such as natural disasters. Meanwhile, the

Gini coefficient, which measures the depth of the

inequality, in terms of household income was 0.48 in

2012/13 in comparison to 0.49 in 2009/10. The Gini

coefficient in terms of household expenditure was

recorded at 0.40 in 2012/13 in comparison to 0.37

in 2009/10. Therefore, income inequality remains

as an issue to be addressed, while inequality in

consumption has increased in the recent period.

The increased consumption inequality was

associated with unequal access to health and

education services. Recognising the importance of

eradicating poverty for inclusive economic growth

in Sri Lanka, the government has declared 2017 as

the ‘Year of Poverty Alleviation”. This programme

is expected to give due recognition to implement

a comprehensive programme of poverty alleviation

for Sri Lanka while giving priority to attain the

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030

through a collaborative approach.

Social protection programmes have

increasingly focused on developing the

household livelihoods and enhancing an

inclusive growth. During 2016, Rs. 40.7 billion

was granted under the Samurdhi/Divineguma

subsidy programme, which is the foremost social

safety net programme in the country, benefiting

1.41 million families. Further, around Rs. 987.6

million was disbursed among 323,396 beneficiaries

under the Samurdhi/Divineguma Social Security

Fund during the period under review. Additionally,

in order to uplift the nutritional status among

mothers and children, the Ministry of Women and

Child Affairs disbursed around Rs. 5.7 billion and

Rs. 106.4 million under the programmes of food

packages for pregnant mothers and fresh milk for

children between 2-5 years, respectively, in 2016.

In addition, the government continued to implement

several other social assistance programmes,

including the school food programme, Thriposha

programme, disability and relief assistance, elderly

payment and disaster relief assistance, during

2016.

While social protection programmes are

essential to uplift the consumption levels of the

poor in the short-term, the government needs

to focus more on enhancing income generating

capacities of low-income households so that

they would not continue to remain in poverty

and be a burden on the government. To this end,

institutional support for low-income households, can

be provided through numerous ways. Encouraging

farming community to diversify their income

sources, increasing the contribution of women

towards the household income through increased

female labour participation and female employment,

improving financial inclusion by supporting better

financial management and encouraging household

savings and skilled migration through vocational

training programmes for low income household

people are some of the possible policy measures

for reducing poverty in the long-run.

Environment

Balancing economic growth and negative

externalities created by economic activities

has been a challenging task in economic

development process. Generally, high economic

growth requires increased consumption of natural

resources along with the large scale production

of waste material. Therefore, environment

conservation needs to be an in-built process

within economic development process with the

adoption of a sustainable level of natural resource

consumption and proper waste disposal to prevent

environmental degradation that may cause hazards

to all living beings.

The government of Sri Lanka continued to

strengthen public awareness and institutional

support in relation to environment protection

during 2016. Following the United Nations

Framework Convention on Climate Change in

2015, the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and

Environment commenced a programme called

'Sri Lanka NEXT-A Blue Green Era' in 2016,

to create awareness among people on climate

change and future development strategies. The

Cabinet of Ministers has approved to develop

10,000 ‘Blue Green Beautiful Lanka Villages’ within

the 2016 to 2020 period, in collaboration with

community organisations such as the SANASA

movement of Sri Lanka, the Sarvodaya movement

and the organisational network of the Divinaguma

Department under this programme. In addition,

the sixth National Symposium on Air Quality

Management in Sri Lanka was held under the

theme of ‘Air That We Breathe-2016’ in May 2016.

The event was a platform to discuss the views of

technocrats, scientists and other professionals

from a number of state and private institutions

in the country, involved in air quality research,

development and implementation activities for

a green economy. In addition, several training

programmes and workshops were carried out to

create awareness among farmers and students on

the bio-diversity of flora and fauna in agricultural

fields and about toxin free food production. In 2016,

Sri Lanka ratified the Paris Agreement and joined

with the international community to setup a plan

to reduce global warming. The Paris Agreement

entered into force on 04 November 2016. The

central aim of the Paris Agreement is to strengthen

the global response to the threat of climate change

by keeping the global temperature within this

century at a level below 2 degrees Celsius above the

pre-industrial levels. Additionally, the agreement

aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal

with the impacts of climate change.

The Central Environmental Authority (CEA)

carried out a wide array of programmes to

protect and manage the environment enabling

sustainable economic growth. Solid waste

management has been a priority for the CEA

during the period under review. Accordingly, funds

were provided by the CEA’s Pilisaru project to

various local authorities to establish new compost

sites, bio gas plants, sanitary landfills, plastic

recycling centres, plastic/polythene waste storage

centres during 2016. The CEA also implemented a

project to construct integrated solid waste disposal

facilities in the form of scientifically proven sanitary

landfills, as the final disposal facilities for municipal

solid waste that is currently being disposed in a

haphazard manner. Under this project, sanitary

landfills are being constructed in Keerikkulama

in Anuradhapura, Monroviawatta in Hikkaduwa,

Meegaswewa in Medirigiriya and Keerimalai in

Jaffna that would serve as cluster based common

final disposal facilities to dispose residual waste

generated in respective local authority areas.

During 2016, the detailed designs of Keerikkulama,

Meegaswewa and Monroviawatta sites and the

conceptual design of the Keerimalai sites were

completed. During 2016, various educational

programmes were conducted through the Green

Park for staff of local government officers, students

and government and non-government officers.

In addition, an electronic waste management

project and an integrated polythene and plastic

management project were initiated by the CEA

during 2016. Moreover, several water quality

monitoring programmes were carried out in 2016,

particularly in the Kelani and Bentota rivers. In

addition, the CEA declared areas surrounding

waterfalls as Environment Protection Areas

(EPAs). Meanwhile, the granting of approval

for mini-hydro projects in waterfalls has been

limited, in consideration of the direct and indirect

environmental impact of such projects on the

waterfalls. Further, the CEA monitored nine EPAs

that have been previously identified and proposed

six more EPAs during the year under consideration.
