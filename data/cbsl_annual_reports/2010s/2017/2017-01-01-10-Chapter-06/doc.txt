6.1 OverviewT

he government committed sturdily

towards implementing revenue based

fiscal consolidation measures during

2016, recognising the persistently low revenue

mobilisation, which leads to high budget

deficits, as the root cause of fiscal imbalances

experienced for several decades in Sri Lanka.

Even though Sri Lanka’s per capita income has

increased steadily over the last two decades,

revenue collection has been well below government

expenditure, and has not been adequate even to

cover recurrent expenditure of the government.

Weak tax revenue collection emanating from

complex tax laws, various tax exemptions and

tax holidays, narrow tax bases, tax evasion and

weaknesses in tax administration has resulted in

the government revenue to GDP ratio dropping to

a level as low as 11.5 per cent in 2014 from over 20

per cent in the 1990s. The low revenue performance

has resulted in the government depending more

on borrowings to finance the budget deficit. Debt

financing has not only crowded out funds available

for private investment, but has also exerted upward

pressure on market interest rates. Moreover, heavy

reliance on domestic bank financing to fill the

resource gap has exerted inflationary pressures

in the economy while increased foreign financing

has led to higher foreign exchange exposure

risks. The government has tended to borrow

more, even to service the debt, thereby further

contributing to debt accumulation over the years.

In 2015, for instance, the government spent 90.6

per cent of its total revenue on servicing debt. In

this background, the government has recognised

the urgent need for implementing coherent fiscal

adjustments, focusing on a revenue based fiscal

consolidation path, given the limitations in curbing

expenditures, particularly the much needed capital

spending, to meet budgetary targets. Revenue

based fiscal consolidation will expand the fiscal

space and allow the government to accommodate

mandatory recurrent expenditure while financing

public investment programmes, without prejudice

to the sustainability of the government’s financial

position. Moreover, enhanced revenue collection

eases the need for increased foreign borrowings,

thereby easing the pressure on the exchange rate

to depreciate. Accordingly, fiscal policy in 2016

was directed towards strengthening the fiscal

consolidation process to reduce the budget deficit,

and thereby curtailing debt accumulation in the

medium term, mainly through domestic revenue

mobilisation and rationalisation of unproductive

expenditures. This policy stance of the government

has been embedded into the three-year Extended

Fund Facility (EFF) programme with the

International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was

entered into by the government in June 2016.

In order to rectify the structural weaknesses

persistent in the government budget during

the recent past, the government committed to

revenue based fiscal consolidation process,

rather than merely pursuing expenditure cuts.

Although the declining trend in the revenue to GDP

ratio observed during the recent past, which is a

key concern on the fiscal front, was reversed in

2015, further measures were warranted to maintain

this momentum on a sustainable basis, given the

issues in the country’s tax system. Accordingly,

several reforms were undertaken during the year

to streamline and simplify the tax system, broaden

the tax base, rationalise tax exemptions and

concessions, and strengthen tax administration.

The measures taken during the year included

the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate hike, removal of

several exemptions granted on VAT and Nation

Building Tax (NBT), broadening of the VAT base by

introducing new items into the tax net, reducing the

threshold level of NBT, rationalisation of incentives

granted through the Board of Investment (BOI),

upward rate revisions of other taxes, such as

Economic Service Charge (ESC), and the removal

of exemptions granted under several taxes. At

the same time, measures were taken towards

improving tax collection through the strengthening

of tax administration. In this regard, the process

of automating revenue agencies was expedited

while commencing the operations of the Revenue

Administration Management Information System

(RAMIS) at the Inland Revenue Department (IRD).

Sri Lanka Customs (SLC) also took initial steps

to establish a National Single Window System

(NSWS). Meanwhile, a tax expenditure statement

was presented to the Parliament in the Budget

2017 for the first time, in line with practices of good

governance, accountability and transparency. This

statement provided the cost of tax exemptions,

tax holidays, and other incentives granted by the

government with regard to key taxes. In addition,

the introduction of the new Inland Revenue Act

(IRA), prepared with the technical assistance from

the IMF, submission of quarterly expenditure and

income reports to the Parliament as stipulated in the

Budget 2017 and conducting a diagnostic review

of the VAT are also expected to help enhance

revenue collection.

During 2016, a number of measures were

implemented by the government to rationalise

expenditures. Accordingly, during the year, the

government established the Welfare Benefits

Board (WBB) under the Welfare Benefits Act No.

24 of 2002 that was empowered by Gazette No.

1952/22 on 02 February 2016, to develop and

implement a coherent system of welfare benefit

scheme, as the rationalisation of various social

welfare programmes is essential to achieve the

envisaged fiscal targets. In addition, the fertiliser

subsidy scheme was also revised with the

provision of a cash grant in place of the provision

of fertiliser. Further, a commitment recording

system has been established at the Ministry of

Finance (MOF), which helps to track spending

commitments for each line ministry on a monthly

basis. Further, in December 2016, Phase I of the

Integrated Treasury Management Information

System (ITMIS), the budget planning module,

was rolled out to all ministries. Meanwhile, in

March 2017, Statements of Corporate Intents

(SCIs) were signed for the five largest State

Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) to

enhance oversight and financial discipline of

SOBEs, thereby improving their performance.

The government achieved the key fiscal

targets for the year 2016, reducing the

budget deficit to 5.4 per cent of GDP as a

result of enhanced government revenue

collection combined with the reduction in total

government expenditure, particularly recurrent

expenditure as a percentage of GDP. According

to the Budget 2016 presented to Parliament in

November 2015, the overall budget deficit was

expected to be reduced to 5.9 per cent of GDP

in 2016 from 7.6 per cent recorded in 2015.

Considering subsequent developments, in March

2016, the government highlighted its commitment

to further reducing the budget deficit to 5.4 per cent

of GDP for the year 2016. The government revenue

to GDP ratio increased for the second consecutive

year in 2016, mainly due to the significant

expansion in non tax revenue, driven by the profit

and dividend transfers by the SOBEs, combined

with the increase in tax revenue benefited by the

measures taken on the taxation front. Meanwhile,

recurrent expenditure as a percentage of GDP

declined, amidst the increase in interest payments

over and above the originally estimated amount

for 2016. The capital expenditure and net lending,

as well as public investment as a percentage of

GDP also declined due to the prioritising of public

investment activities. With these developments,

the current account balance, which is a measure of

the government’s contribution to national savings,

improved to a deficit of 0.6 per cent in 2016 from a

deficit of 2.3 per cent in 2015. The primary balance,

which reflects the current efforts of the government

in fiscal operations, as it excludes interest payments

arising due to previous deficits, also improved to a

deficit of 0.2 per cent of GDP in 2016 from the deficit

of 2.9 per cent in the previous year. The improved

primary balance is indicative of government efforts

to achieve greater fiscal sustainability. In financing

the budget deficit, the government mainly relied

on foreign sources, as reflected by the issuance of

International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) of US dollars

1,500 million and US dollars 700 million raised

through a Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility

(FTFF). Borrowings from the banking sector,

amounting to Rs. 140.0 billion, reflected a significant

decline during the year, in comparison to a target of

Rs. 182.0 billion in budget 2016 and Rs. 291.8

billion recorded in 2015. Although the increase

in central government debt in nominal terms was

lower than the previous year, as a percentage of

GDP, it increased to 79.3 per cent by end 2016,

mainly due to lower growth in nominal GDP.

As per the Fiscal Management Report of

the MOF, the medium term objective of the

government is to gradually reduce the budget

deficit to around 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2020.

In line with this, government revenue is expected

to be increased to around 16 per cent of GDP

in the medium term, while public investment is

envisaged to be maintained at around 5 per cent

of GDP. Moreover, a surplus in the current account

balance is expected in 2017 and beyond, enabling

the government to discontinue borrowing for its

day to day operations and contribute to the public

investment programme from its own revenue. In

addition, a primary surplus is also estimated from

2017, which is indicative of the government’s

efforts to maintain the non interest expenditure

within revenue collection. Accordingly, the

implementation of the already identified revenue

reforms without any delay is crucial to meet the

envisaged revenue targets. This process has

to be complemented by rationalising recurrent

expenditure to a more sustainable level. The

maintenance of public investment at a desired

level, complemented by private sector participation

in the provision of infrastructure is also imperative

to create a conducive environment for private

sector economic activities and to help the country

to sustain and enhance human development

outcomes to improve the overall productivity of

the economy. The establishment of cost reflective

pricing mechanisms, such as automatic fuel and

electricity pricing, is also important in preventing

the creation and accumulation of financial losses

of the SOBEs as such losses will ultimately be a

liability of the government. The government may

need additional funding in dealing with natural

catastrophes, such as droughts and floods. It is

important that these funding requirements are

managed within the approved expenditure ceilings.

The government also faces several challenges with

regard to debt service payments in the medium

term, including a bunching of the maturing ISBs,

commencing from 2019, and upward pressure

on interest payments of the government due to

increasing interest rates in the domestic as well as

international markets. Hence, due attention needs

to be given to improving overall debt management

in order to reduce the country’s vulnerability

related to servicing debt. Improving the knowledge

of stakeholders and the general public on the

intended reforms through appropriate awareness

campaigns is extremely important in achieving the

envisaged medium term targets.

6.2 Fiscal Policy Direction and Measures

Fiscal policy in 2016 was directed towards

strengthening fiscal consolidation to curtail

the budget deficit and thereby reduce the

accumulation of government debt. In line with

this, several policy measures were implemented

by the government to enhance revenue and

rationalise recurrent expenditure based on the

objectives and targets laid down in the Fiscal

Management (Responsibility) Act (FMRA) and

government policy statements. As such, the Budget

for 2016, presented in November 2015, proposed

several measures targeting expanding the tax

base, simplifying the tax system and improving tax

administration as well as reforms in the pension

system, fertiliser subsidy and SOBEs, along with a

set of policies related to the improvement of other

sectors in the economy. According to the original

Budget for 2016, the overall budget deficit was

expected to be reduced to 5.9 per cent of GDP in

2016 compared to 7.6 per cent of GDP recorded

in 2015. Considering subsequent developments, in

March 2016, the government announced revisions

to certain taxes in the backdrop of the changing

global economic climate while highlighting its

commitment to reduce the budget deficit further to

5.4 per cent of GDP in 2016.

In line with the budgetary targets, several

revenue measures were introduced in

the Budget for 2016 to enhance revenue

mobilisation. Accordingly, measures were taken

to simplify the tax structure while broadening

the tax base. Meanwhile, redrafting of existing

tax laws also continued during the year to bring

necessary improvements to the tax system

to ensure simplicity, clarity and consistency.

Further, tax administration was also strengthened

through the automation of tax collecting agencies

with the implementation of the RAMIS project at

the IRD and NSWS at SLC.

Several measures were taken to broaden

the income tax base of which some are yet

to be implemented. Accordingly, the following

changes are proposed under income taxes:

(1) a single corporate income tax rate of 17.5

per cent for all sectors other than banking and

financial services, insurance industry, trading activities,

liquor, tobacco, lottery, betting and gaming, (2) a

higher income tax rate of 40 per cent for liquor,

tobacco, lottery, betting and gaming, (3) a rate

of 28 per cent on banking and financial services,

insurance industry and trading activities and

(4) the maximum tax rate applicable to individuals

on profits from any activity other than financial,

trading, liquor, tobacco, lottery, betting and gaming

activity is 17.5 per cent. In addition, the ESC was

increased to 0.5 per cent from 0.25 per cent while

removing the exclusion applicable to profit making

businesses and the maximum liability of Rs. 120

million per annum.

During the year amendments were

introduced to the VAT with a view to broadening

the tax base and enhancing revenue. Several

amendments to VAT proposed on 02 May 2016, of

which some, including the proposal to reduce the

imposition of VAT on wholesale or retail trade to

Rs. 3 million from Rs. 100 million per quarter, were

not implemented. Further, implementation of VAT

amendments was delayed due to a failure to follow

the proper constitutional process in presenting

amendment bills to the Parliament. Accordingly,

a fresh VAT (Amendment) bill was approved by

the Cabinet of Ministers on 13 September 2016,

and the approval of the Parliament for the same

was obtained on 26 October 2016. As per the VAT

(Amendment) Act, the applicable VAT rate for the

period from 02 May 2016 to 11 July 2016 and

from 01 November 2016, is 15 per cent. Further,

several goods and services, such as the supply of

telecommunication services, import of and supply

of telecom equipment including copper cables,

issuance of licenses to local telecom operators by

the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission

(TRC) and supply of healthcare services, were

made liable for VAT during these periods. In

addition, the threshold for registration of VAT was

reduced to Rs. 3.0 million per quarter from Rs. 3.75

million per quarter for the period 02 May 2016 to

11 July 2016 and from 01 November 2016 onwards.

Meanwhile, several other amendments to VAT were

introduced with effect from 01 November 2016.

Accordingly, VAT was imposed on several items,

namely, liquor, cigarettes, coal, perfumes, electrical

and electronic goods and telecommunication

equipment, broadening the VAT base.

Several amendments were also introduced

to NBT with the view of enhancing the tax

base. The liable threshold for NBT registration

was reduced to Rs. 3 million per quarter from

Rs. 3.75 million per quarter, for the period 02 May

2016 to 11 July 2016 and the period commencing

01 November 2016. Removal of exemptions in

respect of telecommunications, supply of electricity

and lubricants also applied for the same period.

In addition, with effect from 11 November 2016, a

number of goods such as printed books, magazines,

journals or periodicals other than newspapers, solar

panel modules and accessories, were exempted

from the NBT. However, the rate of NBT was

unchanged at 2.0 per cent in 2016.

Several policy measures were taken in

the context of excise duties while minimising

revenue leakages, especially on the importation

of motor vehicles and production of liquor.

Accordingly, a unit rate of excise duty was introduced

on the basis of cubic centimeters for motor vehicles.

Further, a 2.5 per cent tax deduction was granted

for vehicles which are driven entirely on Solar,

Hydrogen or Helium in order to encourage the usage

of environmental friendly vehicles in the country.

With a view to minimising illicit liquor production in

the country, it was proposed to introduce a fool-proof

sticker for every tax-paid liquor bottle as a visual

identification for excise officers and customers.

The Customs duty structure was rationalised

with the introduction of a three band tariff

structure while increasing Customs duty rates

on selected items. The four band tariff structure of

25 per cent, 15 per cent, 7.5 per cent and exempt

category was replaced by a three band structure

of 30 per cent, 15 per cent and the exempt with

effect from 21 November 2015, the full impact of

which was seen in 2016. In addition, the Ports and

Airports Development Levy (PAL) was increased to

7.5 per cent from 5.0 per cent. However, a low rate

of 2.5 per cent was introduced for certain electronic

and electrical items while PAL on certain plants

and machinery used for construction, dairy and

agricultural industries was removed during 2016.

The Special Commodity Levy (SCL) on

the importation of several food items was

revised from time to time to provide necessary

protection for farmers and as a supply side

management measure to curtail price hikes in

the domestic market. Accordingly, SCL on the

importation of b’onions and potatoes increased to

Rs. 25 per kg and Rs. 35 per kg, respectively in

March 2016 while the domestic supply conditions

necessitated the increase in SCL on both items

to Rs. 40 per kg in August 2016. Further, SCL

on the importation of red onions was increased

to Rs. 25 per kg from Rs. 5 per kg while that on

the importation of white sugar and brown sugar

was increased to Rs. 13 per kg and Rs. 15 per kg,

respectively, during the second half of the year. In

addition, SCL on the importation of vegetable oil

and seeds of fennel was also increased during the

year. SCL on the importation of whole lentils was

increased to Rs. 5 per kg from 25 cents per kg while

SCL on the importation split lentils also increased

to 10 per kg from 25 cents per kg in September

2016. In November 2016, SCL on the importation

on green gram was increased to Rs. 40 per kg

from Rs. 10 per kg while the same was imposed

on mangoesteens (fresh and dried) at Rs. 200 per

kg, oranges (dried) at Rs. 2,000 per kg, pears at

Rs. 175 per kg, cherries at Rs. 250 per kg, plums

and soles at Rs. 200 per kg and kiwifruit at Rs.175

per kg. In addition, SCL was introduced for Samba

rice, Naadu rice and raw rice at Rs. 15 per kg with

effect from 07 January 2017 and it was further

reduced to Rs. 5 per kg with effect from 28 January

2017 for a period of 30 days with the decline in the

supply of rice in the domestic market. Meanwhile,

SCL on the importation of vegetable oils was

lowered by Rs. 20 per kg for a period of six months

with effect from January 2017.

Emphasis was placed on expediting the

process of automation in revenue agencies

to improve tax administration and enhance

revenue collection. The RAMIS, which

commenced its operations in 2016, enables

taxpayers to register online for the payment of

taxes and obtaining returns in respect of VAT,

NBT, Withholding tax and Pay-As-You-Earn

(PAYE) taxes. In order to improve the effectiveness

of the RAMIS project, IRD conducted awareness

programmes for all stakeholders, regional offices,

and the staff of the IRD emphasising functional

areas of the system, benefits and the prospective

service of the new system. Meanwhile, SLC has

also taken the initial steps to establish Customs

NSWS, linking all border agencies that perform

various regulatory functions in import and export

of goods. The objective of this initiative was to

facilitate the import and export trade and enhance

the efficiency of revenue collection. The expected

outcome of this initiative is yet to be achieved since

some of the border agencies lack the required

infrastructure. Therefore, it has been identified

to implement NSWS as a priority project under

the implementation of World Trade Organisation

(WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. The blue

print for NSWS in Sri Lanka will be prepared with

the assistance of the World Bank during 2017

and the full implementation of NSWS is expected

by 2021. In order to further improve the clearing

process, SLC started to register all importers with it

and created a risk profiling mechanism during the

year for easy identification of low risk importers.

A pre arrival processing mechanism was also

started to ensure faster clearance and release

of goods to the importers. Further, a container

scanning system was installed at ports and airports

to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the

container and baggage clearing process, which

would minimise delays and enhance revenue

collection. In addition, SLC expects to reactivate

the Marine Division in order to curb smuggling

activities through the sea. Meanwhile the ITMIS,

which is being set up at the MOF, is envisaged to

modernise Public Financial Management (PFM)

in Sri Lanka through automation of key functions,

such as budget preparation, budget execution,

accounting for public expenditure and revenue,

Treasury and cash management, and to support

the government in the preparation of financial

statements. Under this system, a new web portal

for MOF was developed and launched in April 2016.

The ITMIS application is being developed under

five phases. The Phase I, Budget Planning and

System Administration Modules was completed

and went live in October 2016. Further, Phase II,

which includes Treasury Management, Revenue

Management, Budget Appropriation, Purchasing

Management, Expenditure Management, General

Ledger and System Administration modules, was

implemented for MOF and the Ministry of Health as

a pilot project, while other spending agencies are

also expected to join during the first half of 2017.

Functions related to the other three phases are

expected to be launched and initiated in 2017.

Several policy changes were implemented

to encourage effective management of public

expenditure in order to achieve the desired

fiscal path in the medium term. In relation to the

proposal of presenting the quarterly expenditure

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

196

6

and income outcomes to the Parliament which

was proposed in the Budget for 2017, preliminary

activities are being taken by the MOF to monitor

fiscal performance. Accordingly, the government

will be presenting the quarterly expenditure and

income outcomes to the Parliament within one

month at the end of any quarter, strengthening

the Parliamentary control of Public Finance. In

line with the fiscal consolidation path, any revenue

shortfall in a particular quarter will warrant the

government to realign the expenditure as well with

the approval of the Parliament. Meanwhile, under

National Budget Circular No. 07/2015, all spending

agencies were instructed to manage expenditure

within the provisions allocated for the year. Under

National Budget Circular No. 05/2016, instructions

were issued to establish quarterly expenditure

ceilings for all expenditure heads in 2017. Further,

spending agencies were advised to implement

necessary actions to complete procurement

procedure within the first quarter of 2017 to

improve the implementation process of 2017

budget proposals. Instructions were also given to

settle the commitments of the previous year before

requesting funds for settling new commitments in

2017. The monitoring mechanism on the utilisation

of budgetary provisions, introduced in 2016

(National Budget Circular No. 06/2015), continued

in 2017 as well under National Budget Circular

No. 01/2017, in order to achieve efficiency in

resource allocation. In addition, a Budget Review

and Implementation Committee was established

in the MOF to monitor the progress of projects

and programmes implemented under the Annual

Budget.

A new salary structure was introduced for

public sector employees in 2016. As per Public

Administration Circular No. 03/2016, the new

salary structure is to be implemented in five phases

on a step by step basis until 2020, commencing

from 01 January 2016. This includes a special

non pensionable allowance paid to retired public

officers who have been re-employed (in terms of

the Public Administration Circulars No 31/2011

and 18/2012) and the interim monthly allowance of

Rs. 10,000 (in terms of the Public Administration

Circulars No. 24/2014, 24/2014 (I) and 05/2015).

Meanwhile, with a view to enhancing the quality of

public service delivery while improving productivity,

the government decided to conduct a cadre review

in government institutions in terms of the budget

proposals 2017.

During the year 2016, automation of

the Department of Pensions was further

strengthened to improve the efficiency of

service delivery. In order to improve registration

and expedite the process of pension payments,

the Department of Pensions introduced a fully

automated online application process under

Pensions Circular No. 02/2016 for registration

of government employees to the Widowers’ and

Orphans’ Pension (W&OP) Fund. Under Pensions

Circular No. 03/2015(I), pensioners were allowed to

submit pension applications online with effect from

10 October 2016 through the Pension Management

System (PMS). Pension disbursements are

managed through the online payment process of

the Department of Posts while the payments made

by the post office network was centralised in 2016.

Further, an online railway warrant system was also

introduced for pensioners in collaboration with Sri

Lanka Railways and Mobitel (Pvt.) Ltd. In addition,

a new insurance scheme in the name of ‘Agrahara

Rekawarana’ was introduced under Pensions

Circular No. 04/2016 for retired public officers who

retired after 01.01.2016.

Although public investment as a percentage

of GDP declined, several major infrastructure

projects continued during the year. Accordingly,

work related to major irrigation schemes, such

as Moragahakanda and Kaluganga projects,

continued in 2016 and the impounding process

of Moragahakanda is in process. Meanwhile, the

development of expressways and the widening

and improving of national roads continued in 2016

as scheduled. Accordingly, construction of Phase

III of the Outer Circular Highway from Kadawatha

to Kerawalapitiya section, and the Southern

Expressway Extension Project from Matara to

Hambantota, also continued. Further, investments

were also made for the acquisition of lands for the

construction of the Central Expressway during

the same period. Construction work related to

Phase II of the Central Expressway from

Meerigama to Kurunegala, commenced in early

2017. In addition, the feasibility study for the

Ruwanpura Expressway is in its final stages and

construction work is expected to commence in

2017. The limited fiscal space available for public

investments necessitates the attraction of private

investment for infrastructure development projects.

Thus, promoting Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)

as a national strategy is important to address the

infrastructure requirement in the country. PPPs,

in general, will ensure higher efficiency and

sustainability in service delivery while facilitating

foreign investments in infrastructure development

projects. Accordingly, the government will have

to establish an enabling environment for PPPs

including the required legal framework, necessary

institutional setup and know how to deal with PPP

agreements that mutually benefit the private sector

and the government in providing infrastructure.

The government continued its social

protection schemes for vulnerable social

groups through various subsidy schemes,

such as Samurdhi/ Divineguma programme,

fertiliser subsidy, food nutritional programmes,

elders’ allowance and special grant for kidney

patients. Accordingly, nutritional programmes,

such as Poshanamalla, Thriposha programme,

fresh milk and school nutrition programmes,

were continued during the year with a view to

improving child and maternal nutrition. Meanwhile,

the government converted the fertiliser subsidy

to an allowance of Rs. 25,000 per hectare up to

a maximum of two hectares per paddy farmer per

annum in place of the provision of a 50 kg bag

of fertiliser at Rs. 350, to rationalise household

transfers. Further, the government extended

the fertiliser subsidy for tea, coconut and rubber

as well in 2016 under which a cash grant of

Rs. 15,000, Rs. 9,000 and Rs. 5,000, respectively

was provided per hectare per annum. Furthermore,

under the free school uniform programme, the

government provided cash vouchers for students

instead of uniform material from 2016. Steps are

also being taken by the government to provide

financial support to families who are affected by the

drought. Accordingly, the government has decided

to provide a cash grant of Rs. 10,000 per month for

affected families for a period of three months.

The government appointed a WBB to

develop and maintain a coherent welfare

benefit scheme for vulnerable groups. The

WBB which was established under the Welfare

Benefits Act No. 24 of 2002 was empowered by

Gazette No. 1952/22 on 02 February 2016 to

develop and maintain a comprehensive welfare

benefit scheme for the most susceptible segments

of the society. The WBB is entrusted with the

responsibility of developing and implementing a

coherent system of welfare benefits management

for all the welfare benefits schemes. It is important

that the system ensures a transparent process of

selection to include all eligible beneficiaries and

make hassle free payments to them. There are

34 different welfare programmes implemented by

Ministries, Departments, Provincial Councils and

other agencies. At present, the management of

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

6

the welfare programmes is done manually and as

a result the programmes lack efficiency, equity and

transparency in their operations. It is also observed

that ineligible beneficiaries are included and eligible

beneficiaries are excluded in the existing selection

process of beneficiaries. Having recognized those

issues the Board has decided to develop transparent

welfare benefits schemes with objectively verifiable

criteria for the selection of beneficiaries, initially

for the welfare programmes implemented by the

Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare, and

gradually expand to cover the welfare programmes

of the other Ministries. Moreover, action was

taken to design and develop a Social Registry and

Integrated Management Information System (MIS)

as a one stop shop for social welfare management.

The Information and Communication Technology

Agency (ICTA) is entrusted with implementing

this task with the support of other organisations

involved. Technical support for all these activities

is expected from the World Bank funded Social

Safety Nets Project (SSNP) of the MOF.

Several initiatives were taken during 2016

to strengthen the financial position and

operations of major SOBEs while meeting the

economic demands of a middle income country.

Accordingly, the SCIs were signed with selected

five main SOBEs namely, Ceylon Electricity

Board, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, National

Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB),

Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd and

Sri Lanka Ports Authority, in March 2017 in order

to improve the oversight and financial discipline

of these SOBEs. A SCI includes objectives and

multilayer corporate plan, capital expenditure and

financing plan, explicit financial and non financial

targets and cost of non commercial obligations

of selected five key SOBEs. In addition, the

government expects to bring all SOBEs under a

government owned holding company, which will be

operated under sound financial principles. In order

to cater to this purpose, the Public Enterprises

Act has been drafted. Further, guidelines for

appointing professionals to Director Boards of

SOBEs were issued by the Ministry of National

Policies and Economic Affairs as per the Cabinet

Decision No. 16/0640/706/023, dated 08 April

2016, in order to strengthen the professionalism

of the entities. Having considered the continuous

loss making position of SriLankan Airlines (SLA),

the government is currently in the process of

restructuring SLA and expects to offer an equity

stake and management control of the company in

order to continue and strengthen the operations

of the company. Further, a Letter of Support

was issued to SLA, indicating that the required

government financial support will be provided to the

entity until the restructuring process is completed.

In addition, the government directed SLA to absorb

the route network operated by Mihin Lanka (Pvt)

Limited (MLL) with effect from 30 October 2016,

considering the deteriorated financial position of

MLL. In this context the government has provided

required financing support to both SLA and MLL

through Letters of Comfort during 2016 and early

2017. Having considered the financial constraints

of the NWS&DB, the government decided to

bear 50 per cent of the debt service payment of

the Urban Water Supply Projects and 75 per cent

of the Rural Water Supply Projects through the

General Treasury. Further, lent loans granted up

to end of 2014 to the NWS&DB by the General

Treasury were converted to government equity in

2016 with a view to strengthening its balance sheet.

Meanwhile, a cost reflective pricing formula, which

has been designed to adjust domestic market

retail prices in line with international prices for two

main petroleum products of the CPC, i.e. petrol

and diesel, has been submitted to the Cabinet of

Ministers for its approval.

The public debt management strategy was

further improved in 2016 with the introduction

of several new measures. Accordingly, on 04

August 2016, the Central Bank commenced

releasing summary trading statistics on actual

trading of government securities in the secondary

market for the first time with a view of promoting

transparency, price discovery and outreach of the

government securities market parallel to other

financial markets. In order to improve transparency

in government securities, all Primary Dealers and

commercial banks joined the Bloomberg Electronic

Bond Trading Platform for government securities

secondary market transactions as per the

instructions issued by the Central Bank. As a result,

all Primary Dealers are required to report all outright

sales of government securities of value in excess

of Rs. 50 million to investors to this platform within

30 minutes of each transaction. This will enable

the Central Bank to monitor transactions on an

ongoing basis thereby improving the transparency

of the process. In addition, the Central Bank has

commenced a procurement process for setting up

a dedicated electronic trading platform along with

the Central Counterparty System. This is expected

to provide market information on a real time basis

in line with other developed financial markets, while

developing the government securities market to

international standards. In June 2016, a decision

was taken not to accept more than the aggregate

amount offered at an auction, although the Central

Bank may accept less than the amount offered,

with the intention of enhancing the transparency of

Treasury bill and bond auctions.

Measures were also taken to strengthen the

regulation and supervision of Primary Dealers

in line with international standards. Accordingly,

responsibility of the regulation and supervision of

the government securities market was assigned

to the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank

Financial Institutions of the Central Bank. Pre-

bid meetings with all Primary Dealers to share

information on market developments were also

resumed. The Central Bank is also working towards

publishing an annual auction calendar with more

information in collaboration with the MOF. This

will enhance the transparency and predictability

of the primary auction process in the government

securities market and provide information to all

market participants thereby ensuring the availability

of information on potential transactions to all market

players. Meanwhile, measures were also taken to

enable the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) to

actively participate at the primary auctions of the

government securities market.

A number of measures are in the pipe line to

further improve the debt management process.

Accordingly, primary auction rules for government

securities will be published in order to improve

transparency and to standardise procedures. It

is also expected to introduce certain measures

to include outright secondary market sales of

government securities by Non-Primary Dealer

banks to their customers into the trading platform.

Further, the possibility of active debt management

initiatives, such as buy-backs, switching and swap

arrangements, which are also a part of liability

management initiatives, will be explored to improve

the debt management process, with changes in

relevant legislation. In order to deepen and broaden

the secondary market for government securities,

the Central Bank expects to establish an Electronic

Trading Platform and a Central Counter Party (CCP)

arrangement for government securities along with

required legal reforms. Similarly, a mechanism

to disseminate secondary market information on

debt instruments will also be established through

the proposed e-trading platform and the clearing

house. This will help the Central Bank to cope

with the conflict of interest of trying to conduct an

independent monetary policy while at the same

time, raising funds for the government as cheaply

as possible.

The government successfully issued its

10th International Sovereign Bond, reflecting

improved investor sentiment on Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, the government was able to raise

US dollars 1.5 billion in July 2016 through the first

dual tranche offering of 5.5 year (US dollars 500

million) and 10 year (US dollars 1.0 billion) bonds

at yield rates of 5.750 per cent and 6.825 per cent,

respectively, amidst high volatility in the global

markets following the impact of Brexit. In addition,

the government issued a US dollars 300 million

worth of FTFF in June 2016, with a maturity period

of 3 years. Further, government issued another

FTFF amounting to US dollars 400 million with a

maturity period of 3 years in September 2016.

The government entered in to a three-year

EFF programme with the IMF on 03 June

2016 to strengthen the external position of

the country and to support the government’s

broad economic reform agenda. The

programme involves a number of tax policy and

tax administrations improvement measures in line

with the government policy on the same. Under

this programme, the primary balance has been

agreed as the key Quantitate Performance Criteria

(QPC) related to the government fiscal operations.

The QPC in respect of the primary balance for the

period January-June 2016 and January-December

2016 were deficits of Rs. 46.0 billion and of

Rs. 97.0 billion, respectively. The government met

the QPC for primary balance in 2016 successfully.

Some of the international sovereign rating

agencies upgraded their ratings in early 2017

although few of them made downward revisions

to Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit ratings in 2016.

On 29 February 2016, Fitch revised Sri Lanka’s

foreign currency rating of “BB-” to “B+”, and revised

Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating outlook to “negative”

from “stable”, citing Sri Lanka’s heightened

vulnerabilities due to increasing refinancing risks,

significant debt maturities, weaker public finances,

decline in foreign exchange reserves and high

foreign currency debt. However, having considered

the continuous improvement in fiscal performance,

improved policy coherence and credibility with the

ongoing IMF-EFF programme and stable growth in

the economy, Fitch affirmed Sri Lanka’s long-term

foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings

(IDR) at “B+” and revised the outlook to “stable”

from “negative” on 09 February 2017. Standard and

Poor’s (S&P) affirmed its “B+” long-term rating and

“B” short-term sovereign credit rating on 26 March

2016, although its outlook on Sri Lanka’s long-

term foreign currency sovereign credit rating was

changed to “negative” from “stable” citing the rising

pressures on Sri Lanka’s external liquidity and

relatively weak public finances at that time. On 07

March 2017, S&P affirmed again its “B+” long-term

and “B” short-term sovereign credit ratings with a

“negative” outlook for Sri Lanka citing Sri Lanka’s

weak external sector performance and the possible

vulnerabilities in public finances emanating from

exchange rate shocks. Moody’s Investor Services

also changed the outlook on Sri Lanka’s B1

sovereign rating to “negative” from “stable” on 20

June 2016, highlighting the weakening of some

of Sri Lanka's fiscal metrics in an environment

of subdued GDP growth, which could lead to

renewed balance of payments pressure and lower

than expected effectiveness of the fiscal reforms

envisaged by the government.

Why Revenue Based Fiscal Consolidation?

Fiscal consolidation is a policy that aims at reducing government deficits and debt accumulation.1 Correcting fiscal imbalances, reducing fiscal deficits and thereby curtailing public debt accumulation are priorities in many developing countries although there is no consensus about the best policy mix to achieve it. Fiscal consolidation can take place through curtailing of expenditure, expansion of revenue or using a combination of these two policies. Expenditure restriction should focus on curbing unproductive expenditure as well-planned productive expenditure, particularly directed towards infrastructure and human development, is vital for a country to ensure long term growth. Revenue based fiscal consolidation targets enhancing revenue through expanding the tax base, improving the tax administration, minimising tax avoidance and evasion, revising the tax rates and rationalising tax incentives. Revenue based fiscal consolidation, thus, supports spending capacity of the government although it could be challenging and sometimes politically unpopular to implement, if it excessively introduces new taxes or increases tax rates in augmenting revenue. Though revenue enhancement is the key objective of revenue based fiscal consolidation, a disciplined approach to government spending and prioritisation of public investment also complements the consolidation process.

An examination of Sri Lanka’s budgetary operations with that of regional peers indicates that Sri Lanka’s fiscal imbalances are largely due to the poor revenue performance. Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP in Sri Lanka is at a moderate level of 20.9 per cent when compared to the regional peers. However, on the revenue front, the lowest revenue as a percentage of GDP is recorded by Sri Lanka compared to peer countries (Table B 9.1). Accordingly, fiscal consolidation

BOX 09Revenue Based Fiscal Consolidation towards Sustainable Level of Debt

should rely mainly on measures to broaden the tax base and improve the efficiency of tax collection while ensuring the rationalisation of expenditure, rather than imposing expenditure cuts.

The government’s revenue collection over the past two decades has been persistently low (Chart B 9.1), despite the steady increase in per capita income.2 Revenue mobilisation has been well below the total expenditure incurred by the government and insufficient to cover expenses even of a recurrent nature. Thus, the government has been a net dis-saver. The Sri Lankan tax system suffers from several drawbacks although over 80 per cent of government revenue is raised through different taxes. Various tax exemptions, long tax holidays, preferential rates, substantially high progressive taxes, significantly low ratio of direct to indirect taxes compared to regional peers,3 tax evasion, tax avoidance and complexities of the tax system that hinder tax compliance while making tax administration difficult and costly, are constraints that contributed to erode the tax base and thereby reduced tax revenue over time.

Continuously weak tax collection in the country is mainly driven by the decline in revenue elasticity,4 which has resulted from several factors, including various tax exemptions/ holidays, tax evasion and weak tax administration. As such, government revenue that stood at over 20 per cent of GDP in 1990s dropped

2. However, there is an encouraging performance in the government revenue collection in the past two years.3. In the medium term, it is expected to increase the ratio of direct: indirect taxes to 40: 60 from the ratio of 19: 81 prevailed in 2015. 4. The concept of tax elasticity is used to measure the responsiveness of tax revenue to economic growth. Tax buoyancy is a crude measure which does not distinguish between discretionary and automatic growth of revenue. Elasticity is a preferred measure of tax responsiveness since it controls for automatic revenue changes (Leuthold and N'Guessan, 1986).

to a value as low as 11.5 in 2014. Low revenue performance in Sri Lanka compels the government to rely more on debt financing even to support the government's recurrent expenditure. It contributes to crowding out of private investment in the country while exerting upward pressure on the market interest rates, thereby hindering economic growth. Moreover, the fiscal measures which tend to take place in a context of high borrowings, often result in an intergenerational transfer of benefits that favour earlier generations, is regarded as unjustifiable by many economists.

Meanwhile, debt service payments in Sri Lanka grew at a higher rate than the growth in revenue over the past few decades as reflected by the increasing debt service payments as a percentage of revenue (Table B 9.2). As such, in 2016, interest payments on the existing debt stock absorbed about 36.2 per cent of the total government revenue in Sri Lanka. In addition, debt amortisation obligations consumed a further 44.0 per cent of the revenue. Hence, 80.2 per cent of the total government revenue was absorbed by total debt service payments leaving only a small fraction of the revenue to be utilised for all other public expenditure in 2016.

Sources: Ministry of FinanceCentral Bank of Sri Lanka Revenue based fiscal consolidation is also crucial in maintaining low and stable inflation in the economy,5 which creates a conducive environment for investment decision making. In addition, it minimises the excess aggregate demand generated by unsustainable fiscal deficits, and thereby serves to curtail external sector vulnerabilities. Fiscal consolidation also strengthens and complements the proper conduct of monetary policy. Moreover, the expanded fiscal space resulting from enhanced revenue acts as a cushion against possible adverse shocks that could arise both on the domestic and international fronts.

Enhanced revenue narrows down the fiscal deficits and in the medium term, helps to achieve a positive primary balance.6 Improved fiscal balances, together with the expected economic growth trajectory, would break the vicious cycle of debt accumulation and bring the debt to GDP ratio down to comfortable and sustainable levels. These highlight why it is important to implement a revenue based fiscal consolidation process in a vigorous manner, with a sufficient level of political commitment in Sri Lanka as a top priority. This will eventually ensure debt sustainability7 in the medium to long run.

Fiscal Imbalances and Debt Sustainability

Over the past several decades, the government debt-to-GDP ratio in Sri Lanka continued to remain high. It increased above 100 per cent during the periods 1988-1989 and 2001-2004 (Chart B 9.2).

Per cent

Though the government debt-to-GDP ratio is reported as 79.3 per cent in 2016, it still remains very high when compared to other frontier markets and peer countries in the region (Table B 9.3). Low revenue has led the government to rely heavily on debt creating financing instruments, which contribute to the accumulation of the government debt stock. Higher debt stock augments debt service payments, further contracting the fiscal space available for other mandatory/ productive activities. Moreover, the larger deficits resulting from heavy debt service expenditure eventually paves the way for the country to borrow more, thus creating conditions that expose it towards a ‘debt trap’ or the ‘vicious cycle

6. Primary balance of the government is defined as the differential of revenue and expenditure excluding interest payments. It acts as an indicator of current fiscal effort, since interest payments are predetermined by the size of previous deficits (IMF(1995): Pamphlet Series - No. 49 - Guidelines for Fiscal Adjustment - How Should the Fiscal Stance Be Assessed?). 7. Debt "sustainability" is often defined as the ability of a country to meet its debt obligations without requiring debt relief or accumulating arrears.

of debt’. Further, following the country’s graduation to lower middle income status in 2010, the availability of foreign grants and concessional financing started to deplete significantly, while increasing exposure to non-concessional and commercial borrowings. This has transformed the composition of the debt stock, with an increase in the share of external debt. Within that, the share of more expensive commercial debt has grown as well as the stock of short term debt. This shift has necessitated the country to access international capital markets through the issuance of International Sovereign Bonds at commercial interest rates, further accumulating debt stock while increasing the foreign currency exposure risk.

Accordingly, as a percentage of total foreign debt, concessional debt declined to 46.9 per cent in 2016, from over 90 per cent prior to 2007 (Chart B 9.3).

In light of these developments, the government identified the urgent need for following a decisive revenue based fiscal consolidation path as well as implementing it in a credible and sustainable manner, to prevent any possible fiscal slippages that could pose threats to debt sustainability and

eventually to macroeconomic stability. As such, the government commenced several initiatives in the past few years, with the focus of enhancing revenue and thereby ensuring debt sustainability in the medium to long term.

Strategy for Revenue Based Fiscal Consolidation towards Debt Sustainability

As highlighted above, Sri Lanka’s fiscal imbalances have emanated from poor revenue performances, which have resulted in the accumulation of debt over the years. Lowering fiscal deficits to ensure sustainable debt levels in the medium to long term through domestic revenue mobilisation is crucial in the context of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, over the past few years, the government has taken several steps to revamp tax policies and bolster tax administration, focusing on the areas of: (a) broadening the tax base to ensure a tax revenue of around 15-16 per cent of GDP in the medium term (b) rationalising the tax system while minimising tax exemptions, tax holidays, and special tax rates that are detrimental to fair and effective tax administration (c) augmenting capacity for revenue administration and (d) strengthening public financial management, particularly commitment control, and financial planning and discipline. These steps will improve tax compliance and ultimately strengthen the fiscal consolidation path.

As such, the medium term target is to bring the overall central government deficit down to at least 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2020, while lowering the central government debt to about 70 per cent of GDP, mainly through enhancing tax revenue. Rationalising expenditure and reducing contingent fiscal risks from State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) are also given due attention. Further, a near zero primary balance is targeted for 2017 and a primary surplus of 1 per cent of GDP is expected in 2018. Proposed revision to the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act (2003) with mandatory binding targets for the government deficit and the level of overall government debt would be an important milestone in the fiscal consolidation path beyond 2019. Medium term strategic priorities of the consolidation process also include rationalising public expenditure while eliminating unproductive expenditure, transforming SOBEs to enable them to operate as commercially viable enterprises via restructuring, improving transparency and accountability, and proper targeting of subsidy schemes. The Medium Term Debt Management Strategy provides a framework for a prudent borrowing programme ensuring the availability of adequate funding for the government’s financing needs at the lowest possible cost while minimising risks.

In order to achieve the said targets, the government has already taken several initiatives and more actions are to be implemented in the near future. The

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

in the government revenue to GDP ratio in 2015

continued during 2016, mainly due to the imposition

of several tax measures. However, some of the tax

changes and tax administration reforms showed

slower progress than envisaged, adversely affecting

the expected performance in government revenue.

Overall government expenditure increased

moderately reacting positively to continuous efforts

made by the government to manage government

expenditure. However, recurrent expenditure

including interest payments, salaries and wages and

subsidies and transfers to household still remains

high exerting pressure on government finances while

leaving limited fiscal space for public investment. This

also emphasises the need for PPPs to attract foreign

and domestic private investments to the infrastructure

development activities of the country. Moreover, the

envisaged fiscal consolidation path is expected to

bring down the government’s debt to GDP ratio from

79.3 per cent in 2016 to 70 per cent in 2020. In order

to improve the country’s macroeconomic outlook

and to reduce the rollover cost of existing debt, it is

essential to achieve this target as envisaged which,

however, would be challenging for the government

in the current domestic and international economic

environment. Moreover, the increasing cost of

borrowing of the government is likely to continue in

the medium term as a result of rising interest rates

in the international market following the rate hike

announced by the Federal Reserve in December

2016 as well as in March 2017 and the prevailing

vulnerability in financial markets due to Brexit and

the upward shift in domestic interest rates with the

tight monetary policy stance of the Central Bank.

Further, the depreciation of the rupee against major

foreign currencies is also likely to exert additional

pressure on government debt, although it would

also affect fiscal operations by way of enhancing

the tax base of customs duty and higher amount of

rupees received for foreign financing disbursements.

In the case of foreign debt, a substantial amount of

fresh financing is required to meet the repayment of

existing foreign debt of the country over the next 5-6

years, as there are several series of ISBs to mature.

Hence, careful attention needs to be paid to bunching

of debt maturities when raising debt in the domestic

and international markets. In this context, reforms

must be vigorously continued with a strong political

commitment to decisively address chronic structural

weaknesses in the fiscal sector.

Revenue and Grants

Revenue

Total government revenue as a per cent of

GDP increased for the second consecutive

year in 2016. Government revenue increased to

14.2 per cent of GDP in 2016 from 13.3 per cent in

2015 as a result of continued efforts taken by the

government to enhance revenue collection. This

increase was led by the expansion in non tax revenue

Value Added Tax (VAT) (Amendment) Act enacted in November 2016, including initiatives such as raising the rate and broadening the base by eliminating exemptions while extending VAT on the wholesale and retail trade at a higher threshold, revamping the income tax law by redrafting the Inland Revenue Act (IRA), amending of the Board of Investment Act (BOI), in May 2016, restricting its ability to grant tax exemptions and rationalising tax incentives by focusing them on upfront investment allowances, introduction

of a new IT system (RAMIS) for major domestic taxes, including web based tax filings for income tax and VAT, etc., are among such initiatives.

Though the measures taken towards revenue based fiscal consolidation and the commitment of the government are noteworthy, it is crucial to continue with the necessary fiscal reforms with disciplined and determined political commitment, without deviating from the fiscal consolidation path, in order to achieve the envisaged fiscal targets in the medium to long term.

as a per cent of GDP to 1.9 per cent during the year

from 0.9 per cent recorded in 2015, mainly due to the

increase in profit and dividend transfers from SOBEs.

However, tax revenue as a per cent of GDP in 2016

remained unchanged at 12.4 per cent as recorded in

2015, as a result of the increased revenue from VAT

and import related taxes being partly setoff against

the decline in tax revenue from excise duty on motor

vehicles, corporate and non corporate income taxes

and withholding tax.

During the year, total revenue in nominal

terms increased by 15.9 per cent to Rs. 1,686.1

billion from Rs. 1,454.9 billion in 2015, reflecting

increases in both tax revenue and non tax

revenue. In nominal terms, tax revenue increased

by 8.0 per cent to Rs. 1,463.7 billion in 2016 from

Rs. 1,355.8 billion in 2015. The increased tax

revenue was due to higher revenue collection from all

tax categories, except excise duty on motor vehicles,

withholding tax and corporate and non corporate

income taxes. However, substantial growth in

collection of VAT, PAL and import duties contributed

significantly for the growth in tax revenue. Revenue

from indirect taxes remained as the major source of

tax revenue in 2016 accounting for 82.3 per cent of

total tax revenue. Meanwhile, revenue from direct

taxes declined marginally in 2016 accounting only for

17.7 per cent of total tax revenue owing to a decline

in revenue from corporate and non corporate income

taxes and withholding tax. The share of tax revenue

in total revenue declined to 86.8 per cent in 2016 from

93.2 per cent recorded in the previous year reflecting

a substantial increase in non tax revenue collection.

Revenue from income taxes declined both

in terms of GDP and in nominal terms resulting

from lower tax revenue from corporate and

non corporate income tax and withholding

tax. Accordingly, revenue from income taxes as

a percentage of GDP declined to 2.2 per cent in

2016 from 2.4 per cent recorded in 2015 while in

nominal terms, it declined moderately by 1.4 per

cent to Rs. 258.9 billion from Rs. 262.6 billion in the

previous year. Accordingly, revenue from corporate

and non corporate income tax declined by 7.8 per

cent to Rs. 154.3 billion in 2016 from Rs. 167.3

billion recorded in the previous year. This was

mainly due to the capturing of profit making business

into ESC liability such that ESC tax credit given

against the income tax payables, thereby declining

the corporate and non corporate income tax while

increasing ESC revenue collection. Revenue from

PAYE tax increased by 7.5 per cent in 2016 to

Rs. 28.2 billion as a result of enhanced compliance

with the initiation of RAMIS at IRD. Meanwhile,

revenue from ESC increased substantially to

Rs. 20.5 billion from Rs. 6.1 billion in 2015 as

a result of the increase in the ESC rate to 0.5

per cent from 0.25 per cent combined with the

extension of the ESC coverage to profit making

businesses, of which the turnover of a quarter

exceeds Rs. 50 million. However, revenue from

withholding tax declined by 11.1 per cent to

Rs. 55.9 billion, reflecting the reduction in the

volume of government security issuances during

the year.

Revenue from VAT increased in 2016, both

as a per cent of GDP and in nominal terms. This

was mainly in response to the increase in the VAT

rate to 15 per cent from 11 per cent, expansion

of the VAT base by removing several exemptions

granted under VAT and enhanced compliance

with the initiation of RAMIS system. Accordingly,

revenue from VAT as a per cent of GDP increased

to 2.4 per cent in 2016 from 2.0 per cent in 2015,

while in nominal terms, it increased by 29.0 per cent

to Rs. 283.5 billion compared to Rs. 219.7 billion

in the previous year. VAT revenue generated from

domestic economic activities increased by 28.8

per cent to Rs. 168.1 billion and as a per cent of

GDP it increased to 1.4 per cent from 1.2 per cent

recorded in the previous year. In addition, revenue

from VAT on imports also increased significantly

by 29.3 per cent to Rs. 115.3 billion in 2016 from

Rs. 89.2 billion recorded in the previous year, as a

result of above changes.

Revenue from excise duties, which is the

largest single contributor to the total tax

revenue, declined in 2016 mainly due to the

decline in excise tax revenue from motor vehicle

imports. The share of excise tax revenue to total

tax revenue in 2016 reduced to 31.1 per cent in

comparison to the 36.7 per cent recorded in 2015

led by the decline in importation of motor vehicles.

Accordingly, in nominal terms, revenue from excise

duties declined by 8.6 per cent to Rs. 454.9 billion

in 2016 from Rs. 497.7 billion in 2015 while as a per

cent of GDP, it declined significantly to 3.8 per cent

from 4.5 per cent in 2015. However, excise tax on

liquor, cigarettes and petroleum products increased

by 14.2 per cent to Rs. 120.2 billion, 11.0 per cent

to Rs. 88.8 billion and 23.6 per cent to Rs. 55.7

billion, respectively as a result of upward revision

of excise tax rates on those products. However,

revenue from excise tax on motor vehicles declined

significantly by 29.2 per cent in 2016 to Rs. 186.5

billion from Rs. 263.5 billion responding mainly to

policy measures adopted by the government to

curtail vehicle imports. These include increasing

taxes on selected motor vehicles and introducing

a new valuation method for motor vehicles for the

purpose of calculating excise duty, and imposing

a maximum loan to value ratio (LTV) on loans and

advances granted for the purpose of purchase or

utilisation of motor vehicles starting from the latter

part of 2015.

Revenue collection from import duties

and SCL also increased to 1.8 per cent of

GDP in 2016 compared to 1.7 per cent in

2015. In nominal terms, revenue from import

duties increased by 18.4 per cent to Rs. 156.5

billion, while revenue from SCL increased by

6.8 per cent to Rs. 55.8 billion from Rs. 52.3

billion recorded in the previous year. Increase in

import duty rates applicable on certain articles,

changes made to Customs duty waivers and

the introduction of a three band tariff structure

in 2015 caused the increase in import duty

collection. Increase in revenue from SCL was

mainly attributable to the extension of SCL

liability and time to time revisions made by the

government to the SCL considering domestic

market demand and supply conditions. The

share of import duty in tax revenue increased

to 10.7 per cent in 2016 from 9.8 per cent

recorded in 2015 while, the share of SCL in

tax revenue declined marginally to 3.8 per cent

during the year from 3.9 per cent recorded in

the previous year.

Revenue from all other taxes increased in

nominal terms in 2016. Accordingly, revenue

from PAL increased significantly by 51.5 per

cent to Rs. 88.8 billion due to the increase in

the PAL rate to 7.5 per cent from 5.0 per cent

with effect from 01 January 2016. Revenue

from Cess increased by 33.4 per cent to

Rs. 61.7 billion owing to the increase in Cess

rates applicable on several products, including

garments and footwear. Revenue from NBT

in nominal terms increased significantly by

27.6 per cent to Rs. 57.4 billion reflecting the

increase in revenue from both NBT on domestic

economic activities and NBT on import related

activities. Removal of exemptions granted on

several services and improvements in economic

activities together with higher import volumes,

contributed to the growth in revenue from NBT.

Revenue from the Telecommunication levy

increased in nominal terms by 7.8 per cent to

Rs. 35.9 billion during the year, on account

of the expansion in telecommunication

related activities and the rate increase in

both Telecommunication levy on internet

services and International Telecommunication

Operators’ Levy. Further, revenue from PAL as

a percentage of GDP increased to 0.8 per cent

from 0.5 per cent in 2015, while revenue from

Cess increased to 0.5 per cent of GDP from

0.4 per cent of GDP in 2015. Revenue from

NBT also increased to 0.5 per cent of GDP

during the year from 0.4 per cent of GDP in the

previous year.

Non tax revenue to GDP ratio increased to

1.9 per cent in 2016 from 0.9 per cent recorded

in 2015, while in nominal terms, it increased

by more than two fold to Rs. 222.4 billion from

Rs. 99.1 billion in 2015. The increase in profit and

dividend transfers from SOBEs, followed by fees

and charges, mainly contributed to this increase.

Revenue collection from profit and dividend

transfers of SOBEs increased significantly during

the year by more than threefold to Rs. 108.2 billion

from Rs. 29.8 billion in 2015 as a result of the

improved performance of SOBEs in banking and

insurance, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC),

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and TRC. Meanwhile,

revenue from fees and charges increased to

Rs. 68.4 billion from Rs. 42.4 billion in 2015 mainly

due to increase in embarkation levy, passport and

visa fee. Non tax revenue from other sources, such

as social security contribution, interest and rent,

also increased in 2016. Consequently, the share

of non tax revenue in total revenue increased

significantly to 13.2 per cent from 6.8 per cent

recorded in 2015.

Grants

Total foreign grants disbursed during

the year increased to Rs. 7.5 billion in 2016

from Rs. 6.0 billion in 2015, although it was

considerably below the annual estimate of

Rs. 15.0 billion. Grants received from multilateral

development partners increased by 16.4 per

cent to Rs. 5.1 billion in 2016 from Rs. 4.4 billion

recorded in 2015. Meanwhile, the share of grants

from multilateral sources in total grants declined to

68.4 per cent in 2016 from 73.2 per cent in 2015.

However, grants from bilateral sources increased

significantly to Rs. 2.4 billion in 2016 from Rs. 1.6

billion in the previous year. Major development

partners who also provided grants during the year

were International Development Association (IDA),

World Bank and Germany.

Expenditure and Net Lending

Total expenditure and net lending as a

percentage of GDP declined to 19.7 per cent

in 2016 from 20.9 per cent in 2015 due to the

decline in both recurrent expenditure, and

capital expenditure and net lending. This was

an outcome of continuous efforts taken by the

government to curtail recurrent expenditure as well

as to streamline capital expenditure. Accordingly,

the decline in total expenditure and net lending

was a combined outcome of the decline in both

recurrent expenditure by 0.7 percentage points

to 14.8 per cent and capital expenditure and net

lending by 0.5 percentage points to 4.9 per cent of

GDP. However, in nominal terms, total expenditure

and net lending increased by 1.9 per cent to

Rs. 2,333.9 billion in 2016 from Rs. 2,290.4 billion

in 2015. Public investment, which amounted to 5.0

per cent of GDP in 2016, was significantly lower

than 5.5 per cent of GDP recorded in 2015.

Recurrent expenditure as a percentage of

GDP declined to 14.8 per cent in 2016 from

15.5 per cent in 2015. A decline in all major

recurrent expenditure categories contributed to this

development except interest payments. However,

in nominal terms, recurrent expenditure increased

by 3.3 per cent to Rs. 1,757.8 billion in 2016 from

Rs. 1,701.7 billion in 2015. Increase in interest

payments mainly contributed to the increase in

recurrent expenditure in nominal terms, followed

by increase in expenditure on salaries and wages.

In 2016, interest payments as a percentage

of GDP increased to 5.2 per cent from 4.7 per

cent in the previous year. In nominal terms,

interest expenditure increased by 19.9 per cent

to Rs. 610.9 billion in 2016 from Rs. 509.7 billion

in 2015 mainly due to the relatively higher interest

rates that prevailed in the domestic as well as in the

international markets and the depreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee against major foreign currencies.

The interest payments on domestic debt increased

by 22.8 per cent in 2016 to Rs. 484.2 billion from

Rs. 394.3 billion in 2015, mainly due to an increase

in outstanding domestic debt stock by 7.7 per cent

to Rs. 5,341.5 billion as at end 2016, coupled with

the increase in average interest rate on domestic

debt. Meanwhile, interest payments on Treasury

bonds increased by 20.6 per cent to Rs. 356.8

billion in 2016 from Rs. 295.8 billion in 2015 as a

result of the increase in domestic market interest

rates and the increase in Treasury bond stock by

12.4 per cent as at end 2016. Interest payments

on Treasury bills increased by 36.5 per cent to

Rs. 78.8 billion in 2016 from Rs. 57.7 billion in

2015, mainly due to the increase in interest rates in

the domestic market. In addition, interest payments

on Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) and

Rupee loans amounted to Rs. 33.4 billion and

Rs. 2.9 billion, respectively, in 2016. Consequently,

the share of interest payments on domestic debt

in total interest payments increased to 79.3 per

cent in 2016 compared to 77.4 per cent in the

previous year. Meanwhile, interest payments on

foreign debt increased by 9.8 per cent to Rs. 126.7

billion in 2016 from Rs. 115.4 billion in 2015 mainly

due to the increase in the foreign debt stock by

14.2 per cent as at end 2016. Interest payments

became the single largest recurrent expenditure

item, accounting for 34.8 per cent of total recurrent

expenditure and 36.2 per cent of government

revenue during 2016.

Expenditure on salaries and wages declined

to 4.9 per cent of GDP in 2016 from 5.1 per cent

of GDP in 2015, although in nominal terms it

increased by 2.6 per cent to Rs. 576.5 billion.

Salaries and wages paid to central government

employees, including defence personnel, increased

by 5.3 per cent to Rs. 432.7 billion mainly due to

increase in overtime and other allowances as a

result of the commencement of the conversion

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

209

6of interim allowance to the basic salary with the

implementation of the new salary structure from

01 January 2016 for public sector employees.

The share of salaries and wages in total recurrent

expenditure accounted for 32.8 per cent in 2016

compared to 33.0 per cent in 2015 and accounted

for the second largest recurrent expenditure item.

Expenditure on other goods and services as

a percentage of GDP declined to 1.4 per cent in

2016 from 1.9 per cent in 2015. Similarly, in nominal

terms also, it declined by 19.5 per cent to Rs. 169.8

billion in 2016. This was mainly due to government

efforts to rationalise recurrent expenditure on other

goods and services. Expenditure incurred on other

goods and services by the central government and

defence, including public order and safety, declined

by 24.3 per cent to Rs. 144.4 billion in 2016 from

Rs. 190.9 billion in 2015. This accounted for 85.1

per cent of total expenditure on other goods and

services during the year.

Total current transfers and subsidies as a

percentage of GDP declined to 3.4 per cent in

2016 from 3.8 per cent in 2015 mainly due to

the decline in current transfers to households.

Similarly, in nominal terms, current transfers

and subsidies also declined by 4.5 per cent to

Rs. 400.6 billion in 2016 in comparison to

Rs. 419.4 billion recorded in 2015, partly due

to the streamlining of welfare programmes in

line with ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts.

Current transfers to households and other sectors

accounted for 79.2 per cent of total current

transfers, while transfers to public institutions and

public corporations accounted for 12.5 per cent

and 8.3 per cent, respectively, during 2016.

Current transfers to households, including

pension payments, declined to 2.7 per cent

of GDP in 2016 from 3.2 per cent in 2015. In

nominal terms, current transfers to households

declined by 8.2 per cent to Rs. 317.2 billion in

2016 from Rs. 345.5 billion in 2015. Out of this,

pension payments, the largest item under transfers

to households, increased by 10.7 per cent to

Rs. 171.9 billion compared to Rs. 155.3 billion in

2015 due to the conversion of the salary of the

government employees to new salary scales as

per Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016

and increase in the number of pensioners during

the year by 18,915 to 579,414. Expenditure on

fertiliser subsidy declined significantly by 44.0

per cent to Rs. 27.8 billion in 2016 from Rs. 49.6

billion in 2015 mainly due to government efforts to

rationalise expenditure by converting the fertiliser

subsidy to an allowance of Rs. 25,000 per hectare

up to a maximum of two hectares per paddy farmer

per annum in place of the provision of 50 kg bag

of fertiliser at Rs. 350. Expenditure on providing

school uniforms declined by 4.6 per cent to

Rs. 2.2 billion due to cost streamlining measures

implemented by the government in 2016. Providing

cash vouchers from 2016 instead of the provision

of uniform material reduced the cost incurred

by the government for packaging, storing and

delivering material. Expenditure on Samurdhi

programme increased marginally by 1.9 per cent

to Rs. 40.7 billion during the year compared to

Rs. 40.0 billion recorded in the previous year. In

addition, expenditure on welfare programmes for

disabled soldiers increased by 13.9 per cent to

Rs. 26.7 billion in 2016 from Rs. 23.4 billion in 2015.

Programmes targeting school children, such as

the provision of school textbooks and the nutrition

programme, were among the other major subsidies

provided to households during 2016.

Current transfers to public institutions as

well as public corporations increased during

the year. Current transfers to public institutions

increased by 9.2 percent to Rs. 50.3 billion during

the year due to the increase in current transfers to

the education sector. Further, current transfers to

public corporations also increased by 18.9 per cent

to Rs. 33.2 billion due to transfers provided to cover

operational losses of the Department of Sri Lanka

Railways and the Department of Posts.

Capital expenditure and net lending as a

percentage of GDP declined to 4.9 per cent

from 5.4 per cent in the previous year, due to

the slowdown in public investments during the

year. In nominal terms, capital expenditure and net

lending declined by 2.1 per cent to Rs. 576.1 billion

during the year in comparison to Rs. 588.7 billion

recorded in the previous year. Meanwhile, public

investment, which includes capital expenditure and

lending of the government, declined to 5.0 per cent

of GDP in 2016 from 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2015,

while in nominal terms, it declined by 1.5 per cent to

Rs. 594.0 billion in 2016 in comparison to Rs. 602.8

billion recorded in 2015. Expenditure incurred by

Ministries and Departments on the acquisition of

real assets (purchase of capital assets, and

construction and development of fixed assets)

increased by 4.8 per cent to Rs. 328.2 billion in 2016

from Rs. 313.3 billion in 2015. Capital transfers

declined by 9.5 per cent mainly due to the significant

decline in capital transfers to public corporations.

Meanwhile, on lending of the government to public

corporations increased by 16.3 per cent to Rs. 17.0

billion in 2016 in comparison to Rs. 14.6 billion

recorded in 2015

Public investment in economic and social

services continued during the year and

amounted to Rs. 424.0 billion and Rs. 117.3

billion, respectively in 2016. A significant

amount of investments was made in the areas

of roads, bridges, railways, water supply, power

and energy and irrigation projects. Further, public

investment in education was directed towards the

development of education infrastructure, specially

under the “1000 secondary school development

programme” and “The Nearest School is the Best

School Programme”, upgrading and modernising

secondary education, improving of general

education in Northern and Eastern provinces and

uplifting university infrastructure. Meanwhile, public

investment in the health sector focused mainly on

the construction and improvement of hospitals and

supply of lab equipment during the year. Further,

the government continued the implementation

of several regional and rural infrastructure

development projects in order to reduce regional

disparities.

Key Fiscal Balances

Reflecting a notable improvement in the

fiscal sector, the overall budget deficit, as a

per cent of GDP, declined to 5.4 per cent in

2016 compared to 7.6 per cent recorded in the

previous year. Improvements in both revenue and

expenditure fronts contributed to this noteworthy

achievement. There was a sustainable increase

in government revenue, while overall expenditure

was maintained close to the 2015 level thereby

narrowing the government’s resource gap and

reducing the government’s financing requirement.

These favourable developments were also reflected

in other fiscal indicators as well. Accordingly,

the current account deficit, which indicates the

government’s dissaving position, declined to 0.6

per cent of GDP in 2016, which was significantly

below the deficit of 2.3 per cent recorded in

2015. This achievement was attributable to the

higher growth in revenue collection compared to

the marginal increase in the recurrent expenditure.

In line with this, the primary deficit, which is

calculated excluding interest payments from the

overall deficit that reflects the discretionary fiscal

policy component of the government, also declined

to 0.2 per cent of GDP from 2.9 per cent recorded

in 2015. The negative growth of 3.3 per cent in the

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

non interest expenditure, together with high growth

of 15.9 per cent in revenue and grants contributed

to this significant decline.

Financing the Budget Deficit

In 2016, the overall budget deficit of

Rs. 640.3 billion was largely financed through

foreign sources. Accordingly, foreign financing

contributed to around 61.2 per cent of the total

financing requirement in 2016 compared to 28.5

per cent in the previous year, while the balance was

financed through domestic sources. Consequently,

net domestic financing in 2016 amounted to

Rs. 248.4 billion compared to Rs. 592.7 billion in the

previous year and net foreign financing amounted

to Rs. 391.9 billion compared to Rs. 236.8 billion

recorded for 2015.

With respect to the composition of net

domestic financing, the government relied more

on banking sector borrowings than borrowings

from the non banking sector in 2016. However,

borrowings from both banking and non banking

sectors declined significantly in 2016 in comparison

to the previous year due to greater reliance on

foreign financing. Government financing from the

banking sector, which accounted for 56.3 per cent

of net domestic financing, reflected a decline of 52.0

per cent to Rs. 140.0 billion in 2016 in comparison

to Rs. 291.8 billion in 2015 and the annual estimate

of Rs. 182.0 billion for 2016. There was a net

repayment of Rs. 43.1 billion to the commercial

bank sector in comparison to the borrowing of

Rs. 211.6 billion in 2015. Borrowings from

commercial banks through Treasury bills and

SLDBs declined significantly while borrowings

through Treasury bonds increased significantly.

The decline in borrowings from commercial banks

was offset by the notable increase in borrowing

from the Central Bank, amounting to Rs. 183.1

billion compared to Rs. 80.3 billion in the previous

year. Net borrowings from the Central Bank

increased mainly through Treasury bills amidst a

net repayment recorded in provisional advances.

Meanwhile, financing from the non banking sector

amounted to Rs. 108.5 billion in 2016, representing

a lower share of 43.7 per cent of total net domestic

financing, compared to Rs. 300.9 billion recorded

in 2015.

Government net borrowings by way of both

instruments and non instruments declined

significantly during 2016. Accordingly, net

borrowings by way of debt instruments declined

by 46.1 per cent to Rs. 327.8 billion in 2016 from

Rs. 607.7 billion recorded in 2015. Borrowings

through Treasury bills increased to Rs. 98.5

billion in 2016 from a net repayment of Rs. 26.4

billion recorded in 2015, while borrowings through

Treasury bonds declined to Rs. 349.8 billion

from Rs. 442.6 billion recorded in the previous

year. Meanwhile, net borrowings through SLDBs

during the year amounted to a net repayment

of Rs. 120.5 billion in comparison to Rs. 223.0

billion recorded in 2015. However, there were no

borrowings through rupee loans in 2016 compared

to a net repayment recorded in 2015 amounting to

Rs. 31.4 billion. The non instrument borrowings in

the total net borrowings recorded a net repayment

of Rs. 79.4 billion during the year mainly due to the

net repayments recorded in provisional advances

and commercial bank overdrafts.

Foreign currency denominated domestic

borrowings declined substantially in 2016 due

to the significant repayment of SLDBs. Gross

borrowings from SLDBs with maturity periods

ranging from 1 to 2 years amounted to Rs. 197.0

billion (US dollars 1,365.9 million), while gross

repayment was Rs. 317.5 billion (US dollars

2,186.2 million), resulting in a net repayment of

Rs. 120.5 billion. Meanwhile, borrowings from

offshore banking units (OBUs) of commercial banks

recorded a net repayment of Rs. 7.3 billion during

the year. Overall, net foreign currency borrowings

from domestic sources recorded a repayment of

Rs. 127.8 billion in 2016 compared to the

borrowings of Rs. 223.0 billion in 2015.

Meanwhile, rupee denominated net domestic

financing amounted to Rs. 376.2 billion in 2016

compared to Rs. 369.7 billion recorded in the

previous year.

Net financing from foreign sources

increased during 2016 largely due to the

issuance of 10th ISB, FTFF loans and a few

programme loans obtained during the year.

Accordingly, net foreign financing increased

significantly by 65.5 per cent to Rs. 391.9

billion in 2016 from Rs. 236.8 billion in 2015.

Consequently, the share of net foreign financing

in total financing increased notably to 61.2 per

cent in 2016 from 28.5 per cent in 2015. Net

borrowings through ISBs amounted to Rs. 217.9

billion (US dollars 1,500 million) in comparison

to Rs. 232.8 billion (i.e. the difference between

US dollars 2.15 billion borrowings and US dollars

500 million repayment) recorded in the previous

year. The funds raised from FTFF loans was

Rs. 101.8 billion (US dollars 700 million), while

programme loans amounted to Rs. 42.3 billion

(Us dollars 286.8 million) in 2016. However, net

financing from foreign project loans from bilateral

and multilateral sources declined significantly to

Rs. 67.0 billion in 2016 compared to Rs. 131.3

billion in the previous year. Gross borrowings

from project loans amounted to Rs. 212.3 billion,

while repayments were Rs. 145.3 billion. On

gross basis, Export-Import Bank of China (Exim

Bank), IDA, the government of Japan and Asian

Development Bank (ADB) were the major sources

of foreign financing in 2016. A net outflow of

Rs. 44.3 billion was recorded in respect of

foreign holdings of Treasury bonds, while net

foreign investments in Treasury bills amounted to

Rs. 7.2 billion during the year.

6.4 Government Debt and Debt Service Payments

Government Debt

As at the end of 2016, government debt to

GDP ratio increased to 79.3 per cent from 77.6

per cent recorded at the end of 2015. Increased net

borrowings and lower nominal GDP growth rate were

the main reasons for the increase in debt to GDP ratio

in 2016 despite the substantial decline in the overall

budget deficit as a percentage of GDP. The domestic

debt to GDP ratio declined marginally to 45.1 per cent

by end 2016 from 45.3 per cent recorded as at end

2015, while the foreign debt to GDP ratio increased

to 34.2 per cent by end 2016 from 32.4 per cent in

2015. In nominal terms, total outstanding government

debt increased only by 10.4 per cent to Rs. 9,387.3

billion in 2016 compared to the high growth of 15.0

per cent in 2015 and the last five year’s average

growth of 13.1 per cent. The increase in the total debt

stock due to exchange rate variations amounted to

Rs. 186.6 billion. The discount factor (which is the

net difference in the book value and the face value of

issues and maturities of Treasury bills and Treasury

bonds) also contributed to the increase in the debt

stock by Rs. 88.6 billion, due to the issuance of

government securities largely at a discount during

2016.

The share of domestic debt in total

government debt declined to 56.9 per cent at

end 2016 from 58.3 per cent at end 2015 mainly

due to the lower borrowings from domestic

sources in 2016. Accordingly, the outstanding

domestic debt increased only by 7.7 per cent to

Rs. 5,341.5 billion as at end 2016 compared to

the increase of 15.9 per cent in 2015. The share of

short term debt to total domestic debt declined to

18.1 per cent at end 2016 from 18.4 per cent at end

2015, reflecting a decline in provisional advances

from the Central Bank despite the increase in

Treasury bills. Outstanding amount of provisional

advances declined to Rs. 83.3 billion at end 2016

from Rs. 151.1 billion at end 2015, while Treasury

bills held by domestic investors increased to

Rs. 779.6 billion from Rs. 658.2 billion at end 2015,

owing to the increase in the purchasing of Treasury

bills by the Central Bank during the latter part of

the year. In contrast, the share of medium to long

term debt to total domestic debt stock increased

marginally to 81.9 per cent by end 2016 from 81.6 per

cent recorded at end of 2015. Within the domestic

debt category, the outstanding amount of Treasury

bonds, which accounted for 69.5 per cent of total

domestic debt in 2016, increased by 12.4 per cent to

Rs. 3,714.8 billion at end 2016 from Rs. 3,305.2

billion at end 2015, reflecting higher reliance on

Treasury bonds as a financing instrument compared

to other medium to long term borrowings. Among

other medium to long term debt instruments, rupee

loan stock remained unchanged at Rs. 24.1 billion,

while stock of SLDBs declined by 14.4 per cent to

Rs. 572.2 billion at end 2016.

Reflecting higher reliance on bank

borrowings, the share of banking sector debt

increased while non bank sector debt decreased

marginally. Accordingly, the share of banking

sector and non bank sector debt as a percentage of

total domestic debt amounted to 39.6 per cent and

60.4 per cent, respectively at end 2016, compared

to 38.8 per cent and 61.2 per cent, respectively at

end 2015. In nominal terms, outstanding banking

sector in domestic debt increased by 9.9 per cent

to Rs. 2,114.9 billion at end 2016, reflecting an

increase in outstanding debt owned by the Central

Bank and commercial banks by 62.1 per cent to

Rs. 415.0 billion and by 1.9 per cent to Rs. 1,700.0

billion, respectively during the year. Treasury bills

held by the Central Bank increased by more than

two fold, while provisional advances declined

significantly. Meanwhile, Treasury bonds held by

commercial banks increased substantially by 41.4

per cent to Rs. 731.9 billion, while the stock of all

other debt instruments declined.

Foreign currency denominated domestic

debt declined to Rs. 602.2 billion (US dollars

4,019.8 million) by end 2016 from Rs. 690.1

billion (US dollars 4,790.1 million) at end 2015.

The decline in net borrowings through SLDBs

mainly contributed to the reduction in the foreign

currency denominated domestic debt in 2016. Net

borrowings through SLDBs declined by 14.4 per

cent to Rs. 572.2 billion, while borrowings from

OBUs increased by 38.6 per cent to Rs. 30.0 billion

during the year. Meanwhile, rupee denominated

domestic debt increased to Rs. 4,739.3 billion at

end 2016 from Rs. 4,269.1 billion at end 2015.

Total outstanding foreign debt increased

significantly by 14.2 per cent to Rs. 4,045.8

billion at end 2016. Increased borrowings from

foreign sources to finance the budget deficit and

the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against

major foreign currencies during the year were

the main contributory factors for this increase. As

at end 2016, concessional debt increased at a

lower nominal rate of 9.7 per cent to Rs. 1,897.7

billion, accounting for 46.9 per cent of the total

foreign debt stock compared to 48.8 per cent at

end 2015. In contrast, non concessional debt

increased at a higher nominal rate of 18.4 per cent

to Rs. 2,148.1 billion. Consequently, the respective

share of non concessional debt in the total foreign

debt increased to 53.1 per cent at end 2016 from

51.2 per cent at end 2015. Increased commercial

borrowings, largely on account of ISBs, contributed

to the increase in non concessional debt in 2016.

The depreciation of the rupee against

several major currencies resulted in an

increase in the debt stock by Rs. 186.6 billion

by end 2016. The Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

by 3.8 per cent, 7.0 per cent, 1.7 per cent, 0.3 per

cent and 0.9 per cent, respectively, against the

US dollar, Japanese yen, Indian rupee, Euro and

Special Drawing Rights (SDR), while it appreciated

against the Sterling Pound by 16.0 per cent, during

the year. The total outstanding foreign debt stock

consisted of debt denominated in US dollars (54.6

per cent), SDR (18.7 per cent), Japanese yen (12.3

per cent), Euro (4.5 per cent) and other currencies

(9.9 per cent) as at end 2016. Consequently, the

outstanding foreign debt stock increased by

Rs. 161.7 billion mainly due to the depreciation

of the Sri Lankan rupee against major foreign

currencies, while foreign currency denominated

domestic debt (SLDBs and loans from OBUs) also

increased by Rs. 24.9 billion due to the depreciation

of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar.

Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments increased by

2.6 per cent in nominal terms to Rs. 1,352.4

billion in 2016 from Rs. 1,317.8 billion in 2015,

reflecting a notable decline in particularly

foreign amortisation payments. This decline was

mainly attributable to the fact that there were no

ISB maturities in 2016, as against the ISB maturity

of US dollars 500 million in January 2015. Total

amortisation payments, which accounts for 54.8 per

cent of total debt service payments declined by 8.2

per cent (Rs. 66.6 billion) to Rs. 741.5 billion in 2016

compared to Rs. 808.1 billion in 2015. The interest

payments increased by 19.9 per cent (Rs. 101.2

billion) to Rs. 610.9 billion in 2016 from Rs. 509.7

billion in 2015, mainly reflecting the relatively high

interest rates. Debt service payments to domestic

sources increased by 15.1 per cent (Rs. 138.5

billion) to Rs. 1,056.6 billion in 2016 compared to

Rs. 918.1 billion in 2015. This was a combined

outcome of the increase in amortisation payments

by Rs. 48.6 billion to Rs. 572.4 billion, driven by the

higher repayments on SLDBs and the increase in

interest payments by Rs. 89.9 billion to Rs. 484.2

billion owing to increased interest payments on

Treasury bonds. However, debt service payments

to foreign sources declined significantly by 26.0

per cent (Rs. 103.9 billion) to Rs. 295.8 billion in

2016, with the decline in amortisation payments

on foreign loans by Rs. 115.2 billion to Rs. 169.1

billion. Interest payments on foreign debt increased

by 9.8 per cent to Rs. 126.7 billion in 2016 mainly

due to the increase in the stock of non concessional

foreign borrowings.

Most of the debt service indicators showed

improvements in 2016. Total debt service

payments declined to 11.4 per cent of GDP in

2016 from 12.0 per cent of GDP in the previous

year. Domestic amortisation payments to GDP

ratio remained unchanged at 4.8 per cent in 2016,

while foreign amortisation payments declined to

1.4 per cent in 2016 from 2.6 per cent in 2015.

The total interest payments to GDP ratio increased

to 5.2 per cent in 2016 from 4.7 per cent in 2015.

Interest payments for domestic sources to GDP

ratio increased to 4.1 per cent in 2016 from 3.6 per

cent in 2015, while the foreign interest payments

remained unchanged at 1.1 per cent of GDP in

2016 compared to the previous year. Moreover,

the ratio of debt service payments to government

revenue has also declined significantly to 80.2 per

cent in 2016 from 90.6 per cent in 2015, reflecting

the increase in government revenue during 2016.

Outstanding Debt of Major Public Nonfinancial Corporations

Outstanding debt of major public

nonfinancial corporations, which includes

outstanding debt to domestic banking sector

and project related foreign debt, declined in

2016 with improved financial management in

the respective institutions. Accordingly, total

outstanding debt of major public nonfinancial

corporations declined by 3.9 per cent to

Rs. 827.4 billion at end 2016 from Rs. 861.1 billion

declined by 5.3 per cent to Rs. 495.1 billion, which

accounts for 59.8 per cent of the total outstanding

debt of major nonfinancial corporations. Project

related foreign debt also declined by 1.7 per cent

to Rs. 332.3 billion. However, the relative share

of project related foreign debt to total outstanding

debt of major public nonfinancial corporations

increased marginally to 40.2 per cent as at

end 2016 from 39.3 per cent at end 2015. As a

percentage of GDP, outstanding debt of major

public nonfinancial corporations amounted to 7.0

per cent by end 2016, in comparison to 7.7 per

cent in the previous year.

6.5 Budgetary Operations in Sub National Governments

Policy Direction and Measures taken by Sub National Governments

As in the previous years, the Ministry of

Provincial Councils and Local Government

(MPCLG) continued to play an important role

in governance and development at the sub

national government level in 2016. The sub

national government system in Sri Lanka consists

of nine Provincial Councils (PCs) and 335 Local

Government authorities (LGs). As at end 2016, the

LG system comprised of 23 Municipal Councils,

41 Urban Councils and 271 Pradesheeya Sabhas.

The MPCLG continued to work closely with sub

national government authorities while monitoring

and effectively addressing their provincial level

development needs. Accordingly, the MPCLG

facilitated provincial level investments through

effective donor coordination while providing

enhanced management and development support

to the PCs and LGs.

In the sub national government level, priority

was given to continue road development

projects and upgrading education and health

facilities during the year. The Local Government

Enhancement Sector Project (Pura Neguma

programme) continued in 2016 with the objective of

improving infrastructure services in selected local

authority areas, with the implementation of water

supply projects and improvement of Pradeshiya

Sabha roads. Further, under this project, information

technology based new systems were introduced in

order to provide an upgraded service delivery to

the general public in a timely manner. The Northern

Roads Connectivity Project was implemented with

a view to improving the connectivity of provincial

roads. Project of Transforming School Education

Development Programme and Second Health

Sector Development Project were continued

during the year in order to improve educational

and health facilities. In addition, Greater Colombo

Wastewater Management Project, Strengthening

of Local Government – Pradeshiya Sabhas, North

East Local Services Improvement Project, and

several Township Development Programmes

were also continued during the year. Moreover,

the Construction of Rural Bridges programme and

Iranamadu Irrigation Development Project were

also continued during the year 2016.

The Finance Commission initiated several

measures to enhance revenue collection at

provincial level. Accordingly, a nine member

Committee, headed by the Secretary of the Finance

Commission, was established in order to develop

an action plan for the enhancement of revenue in

local authorities. The committee agreed to proceed

with some workable solutions for matters such as

strengthening procurement process, secretariat

service at local level, tax avoidance, introducing

new taxes, rates, acreage tax, transferring court

fines, collection of arrears of income and new act on

provincial and local government. Further, in 2016,

the Finance Commission has agreed in principle to

re-introduce a grant system in order to incentivise

province wise revenue collection.

Budgetary Operations in Provincial Councils

Tax revenue collection of PCs continued to

increase in 2016 as well. Total revenue of PCs

increased by 13.4 per cent to Rs. 77.1 billion in

2016 from Rs. 68.0 billion in 2015 mainly due to

increased stamp duty and NBT revenue transferred

from the central government, while as a percentage

of GDP, it increased to 0.7 per cent in 2016 from

0.6 per cent in 2015. Tax revenue increased by

12.7 per cent to Rs. 69.3 billion, while non tax

revenue increased significantly by 20.0 per cent to

Rs. 7.8 billion in 2016 compared to Rs. 6.5 billion

in 2015. Revenue from stamp duty, which is the

largest contributor to the total tax revenue of PCs,

increased by 20.9 per cent to Rs. 32.6 billion in

2016 from Rs. 27.0 billion in 2015, reflecting the

increased revenue collection from stamp duty on

transferring deeds. NBT revenue transferred from

the central government also increased by 14.7 per

cent to Rs. 25.0 billion, on account of the removal

of exemptions granted on several services and

improvement in economic activities, while the

revenue from license fees declined by 10.0 per

cent to Rs. 9.6 billion in 2016. Revenue from stamp

duty and NBT revenue transfers from the central

government accounted for 47.1 per cent and 36.1

per cent of total tax revenue of PCs, respectively.

The relative share of the Western Provincial

Council on revenue collection increased marginally

to 53.1 per cent in 2016 from 52.4 per cent in

2015. The Western Province was followed by the

North Western and Central provinces accounting

for 9.4 per cent and 8.7 per cent, respectively of

the total revenue collection of PCs. Meanwhile, the

relative share of the revenue collection of Southern

Province declined notably to 8.3 per cent from 9.0

per cent during 2016.

Although recurrent expenditure of PCs

increased by 5.2 per cent to Rs. 233.7 billion

in 2016 from Rs. 222.2 billion in 2015, as a

percentage of GDP, it remained unchanged at

2.0 per cent in 2016. The increase in recurrent

expenditure was mainly due to the increase in

personal emoluments by 6.5 per cent to Rs. 183.0

billion, which continued to be the single largest

item in recurrent expenditure accounting for 78.3

per cent of the total recurrent expenditure of

PCs. The education and health sectors absorbed

nearly 90 per cent of the personal emoluments of

PCs. On a functional basis, recurrent expenditure

on social services increased by 5.2 per cent to

Rs. 210.2 billion, while recurrent expenditure on

Provincial administration and economic services

also increased by 4.5 per cent and 4.6 per cent to

Rs. 19.1 billion and Rs. 4.4 billion, respectively in

2016. In terms of total recurrent expenditure, the

three highest spending PCs were Western, Central

and Southern, accounting for 22.3 per cent, 12.4

per cent and 11.9 per cent, respectively.

In line with the ongoing fiscal consolidation

process, with the prioritisation of public

investment programmes, capital expenditure of

PCs declined by 15.7 per cent to Rs. 39.9 billion

in 2016 from Rs. 47.4 billion in 2015, mainly

due to the decline in acquisition of capital

goods and special projects by 36.9 per cent

and 27.9 per cent, respectively. Similarly, as a

Sources: Ministry of FinanceMinistry of Provincial Councils and Local Government(a) Revised

percentage of GDP, capital expenditure of PCs

declined to 0.3 per cent in 2016 from 0.5 per cent

in 2015. Capital expenditure incurred on special

projects in 2016 amounted to Rs. 12.2 billion, while

Rs. 12.2 billion was also incurred on Province

Specific Development Projects (PSDPs). Other

provincial level investments were made mainly in

the areas of acquisition of capital assets and capital

transfers to local governments.

In 2016, central government transfers to PCs

declined by 2.5 per cent to Rs. 196.6 billion.

These transfers were in the form of block grants,

Criteria Based Grants (CBGs), Province Specific

Development Grants (PSDGs) and grants for

special projects. Block grants, the major form of

central government transfers to PCs, amounted to

Rs. 169.1 billion, representing 86.0 per cent of the

total transfers. These grants have been provided to

meet the resource gap in the recurrent expenditure

programme of PCs. Transfers under grants for

special projects, PSDGs and CBGs amounted to

Rs. 12.2 billion, Rs. 12.2 billion and Rs. 3.0 billion,

respectively. Meanwhile, nearly 71.8 per cent of the

expenditure of PCs was financed by transfers from

the central government due to the limited scope

available for PCs to raise revenue. Therefore,

efforts for revenue mobilisation by PCs need to be

encouraged to reduce the reliance of PCs on the

central government budget.
