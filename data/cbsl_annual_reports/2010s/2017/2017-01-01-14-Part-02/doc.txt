Activity Report of Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee

for the Year 2016

1. Introduction

The Audit Committee of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was established in 2001 and renamed as Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (AAC) in 2009. The Committee advises the Monetary Board on policies and matters relating to the audits of the Bank in the areas such as financial reporting, internal controls and risk management systems, compliance, internal audit and external audit. The AAC reports its recommendations and performance to the Monetary Board for consideration quarterly and when necessary.

2. Composition of AAC

The AAC is chaired by an appointed member of the Monetary Board and comprises of two other external audit professionals. The Secretary to the Monetary Board is the Secretary to AAC and the Director of the Internal Audit Department is the Assistant Secretary to AAC. The Internal Audit Department (IAD) provides secretarial facilitation for the AAC. A representative from Auditor General’s Department attends as an observer to the AAC meetings.

The AAC is a subcommittee of the Monetary Board and the composition of the Committee as at 31 December 2016 was as follows:

i. Mr. A N Fonseka - Chairman (with effect from 16.08.2016)ii. Mr. M R Mihular - Memberiii. Mrs. A M J Patrick - Member

Mr. R A Jayatissa, former member of the Monetary Board served as the Chairman of AAC until 24.05.2016 and Mrs. M Ramanathan, member of the Monetary Board served as the Chairperson from 25.05.2016 to 15.08.2016.

Other regular attendees of the AAC Meetings are Compliance Officer of the Bank and relevant staff of the IAD. Heads of Departments are invited by the Chairman of AAC when required. The Chief Accountant and the engagement partner of the Audit Firm appointed by the Auditor General to carry out the external audit also attend when the financial statements of the Bank are discussed.

The Committee is required to meet at least six times a year or as may be decided by the Chairman of the AAC or as directed by the Monetary Board. Meetings of the Committee are convened by the Secretary of the Committee. A quorum of two (02) members including the Chairman is required for a meeting.

3. Activities carried out in 2016

The AAC held eight (08) meetings during 2016 and made recommendations relating to the following.

a) Financial reporting:

The Committee,

i. reviewed the Interim Issue Memorandum on the audit of Financial Statements of the Central Bank for the year ended 2015 and made recommendations to the Monetary Board on the changes to accounting policies, different methods available in accounting for significant transactions and improving clarity of disclosure in the financial reports of the Bank.

ii. reviewed the Management Letter of Central Bank for the year 2015 and recommended on the changes to accounting policies and accounting methods to improve internal controls in Central Bank processes and procedures.

e) External audit:

The Committee,

ii. reviewed the Management Letter of the Central Bank for the year 2015, the responses of management thereto and the recommendations of the External Auditor.

4. Amendments to the Framework of AAC

The Committee reviewed the Framework of AAC at several meetings and the revised Framework was approved by the Monetary Board in September 2016.

The Central Bank was established as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of the monetary, financial and payment systems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act. In accordance with this Act, the Bank is charged with the responsibility of securing the core objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability.

The basis of accountability for the Central Bank and the success of its operations therefore would be the effectiveness of its policies and operations leading towards the achievement of its core objectives and not necessarily its profitability. These statutory objectives are the fundamental features that distinguish the Central Bank from any other entity, private or public. Accordingly, profitability related approach, if adopted by the Central Bank, could result in the Bank pursuing profits while compromising its core objectives, since it has the unique ability to create its own profits through its monetary policy activities, which could influence interest rates and exchange rates. It therefore

Central Bank of Sri LankaManagement StatementFor the period ended 31 December 2016

Accountability and the Financial Performance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in relation to the Objectives

follows that the Central Bank’s objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability need to be distinguished and detached from the pure profitability objective which should essentially be incidental or academic only.

In this background, the Central Bank’s financial statements record gains and/or deficits in the implementation of its monetary policy operations, exchange rate management, issuing of currency, etc. at the values as realized and hence, the financial performance as reported in these statements needs to be interpreted and understood in that context.

The Bank is subject to an external audit by the Auditor General under the Monetary Law Act sections 42 & 43. The Auditor General in turn has obtained the services of a firm of Chartered Accountants, M/S Ernst & Young, to carry out an audit under International Standards of Auditing to ensure compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 11

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

1. REPORTING ENTITY AND STATUTORY BASE

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (“Bank” or “CBSL”) is an institution established under the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka as amended (“MLA”), as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka. The Bank is domiciled in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and situated at No. 30, Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 01.

These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Governor and Chief Accountant for and on behalf of the Monetary Board on 07 March 2017.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1 Basis of Preparation

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for land & buildings, gold and certain financial assets that have been measured at fair value as identified in specific accounting policies below.

2.1.1 Reporting Format

The bank presents financial assets and financial liabilities, and their associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency activities. In the Statement of Financial Position, assets and liabilities are presented broadly in order of liquidity within such distinguished categories. The bank considers that this reporting approach provides appropriate reporting of the bank’s activities which are more fully described in Note 4.

2.1.2 Statement of Compliance

These financial statements of the Bank for the period ended 31 December 2016 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Such financial statements are audited by the Auditor General and gazetted as required by the law. However, the amounts in the gazetted financial statements would be different from these financial statements due to certain classification differences .

2.1.3 Currency of Presentation

The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (Rs.) and all the values are rounded to nearest Rupees thousands, except when otherwise indicated.

2.2 Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates

The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

2.2.1 Impairment of Available for Sale Investments

The Bank determines that Available for Sale Investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost. This determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgement.

2.2.2 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefit

Plans

The cost of defined benefit plans is determined using an actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future compensation increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Assumptions used are disclosed in Note 45.

2.2.3 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but if this is not available, judgement is required to establish fair values. The judgements include considerations of liquidity and model inputs such as volatility for longer-dated derivatives.

2.3 Standards Issued but not yet Effective

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective which are applicable to the Bank, up to the date of issuance of the Bank’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Bank intends to adopt these standards, when they become effective.

2.3.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

In July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued the final version of IFRS9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and replaces International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and

Central Bank of Sri LankaNotes To The Financial StatementsYear ended 31 December 2016

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 12

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirments for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. Early application of previous versions of IFRS 9 (2009, 2010 and 2013) is permitted if the date of initial application is before 1 February 2015. The adoption of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Bank’s financial assets, but no impact on the classification and measurement of the Bank’s financial liabilities.

2.3.2 Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows

In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows with the intention to improve disclosures of financing activities and help users to better understand the reporting entities’ liquidity positions. Under the new requirements, entities will need to disclose changes in their financial liabilities as a result of financing activities such as changes from cash flows and non-cash items (e.g. gains and losses due to foreign currency movements). The amendment is effective from 1 January 2017. The Bank is currently evaluating the impact.

2.3.3 IFRS 16 Leases

The IASB issued the new standard for accounting for leases - IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. The new standard does not significantly change the accounting for leases for lessors. However, it does require lessees to recognise most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, with the corresponding right of use assets. Lessees must apply a single model for all recognised leases, but will have the option not to recognise ‘short-term’ leases and leases of ‘low-value’ assets. Generally, the profit or loss recognition pattern for recognised leases will be similar to today’s finance lease accounting, with interest and depreciation expense recognised separately in the statement of profit or loss.

IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted provided the new revenue standard, IFRS 15, is applied on the same date. Lessees must adopt IFRS 16 using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.

The Bank does not anticipate early adopting IFRS 16 and is currently evaluating its impact.

2.3.4 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective for periods beginning on 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted. IFRS 15 defines principles for recognizing revenue and will be applicable to all contracts with customers. However, interest and fee income integral to financial instruments

and leases will continue to fall outside the scope of IFRS 15 and will be regulated by the other applicable standards (e.g. IFRS 9, and IFRS 16 Leases).

Revenue under IFRS 15 will need to be recognised as goods and services are transferred, to the extent that the transferor anticipates entitlement to goods and services. The standard will also specify a comprehensive set of disclosure requirements regarding the nature, extent and timing as well as any uncertainty of revenue and corresponding cash flows with customers.

The Bank does not anticipate early adopting IFRS 15 and is currently evaluating its impact.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

3.1 Foreign Currency Conversions

The Bank’s functional and presentation currency is Sri Lanka Rupees (Rs). Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency prevailing at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the Statement of Income. For the purposes of retranslation the following Sri Lanka Rupee exchange rates for major currencies were used:

Currency2016Rs.2015Rs. 1 Australian Dollar108.2380105.38881 Canadian Dollar111.0617103.72781 Euro158.4959157.40971 Japanese Yen1.28181.19701 Special Drawing Rights (SDR)201.3811199.63101 Sterling Pound184.5087213.55081 United States Dollar149.8000144.06231 Chinese Yuan (Offshore)21.490121.9285

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using exchange rates at the dates of initial transactions.

3.2 Fair Value Measurement

The Bank measures financial instruments such as foreign securities, derivatives, non-financial assets such as Land and Building at fair value at each reporting date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 46.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either :

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 13

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

• In the principal market for the asset or liability or• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Bank. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

3.3 Financial Assets and Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities, and the associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency activities. Foreign currency activities mainly arise from the bank’s foreign reserves management function. Local currency activities mainly reflect the assets and liabilities associated with monetary policy implementation, issuing currency and banking activities.

The separate reporting of these activities is considered to provide a better presentation of the Bank’s financial position, financial performance and risk profile. The Bank considers that the combined reporting of foreign and local currency activities would weaken the informational value of the financial statements.

All financial assets are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment. Subsequent measurement bases after initial recognition are described below. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

3.3.1 Securities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial assets classified as held for trading are included in the category “Securities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss”. These securities are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market values are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the securities in the Statement of Financial Position while resulting gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Income.

Where the security is still owned, the gain or loss is reported as “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations”. Where the gain or loss has been realised (through selling the security), it is reported as “Gain /(Loss) from realised Price Revaluations”.

3.3.2 Foreign Currency Available for Sale Investments

Foreign currency Available For Sale investments are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market value are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the Available For Sale securities in the Statement of Financial Position.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the market value of foreign currency Available for Sale investments are recognised directly in equity (Other Comprehensive Income) which is shown under Other Reserves in the Statement of Financial Position until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported as equity is included in Income Statement.

3.3.3 Derivative Instruments

The Bank uses derivatives such as cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps for risk management purposes and not for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in ‘Gain / (Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations’.

3.3.4 ‘Day 1’ Difference

When the transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the same

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 14

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

instrument, or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, the bank immediately recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value (a Day 1 difference) in ‘Gain/(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations’. In cases where fair value is determined using data which is not observable, the difference between the transaction price and model value is only recognised in the income statement when inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

3.3.5 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Related Balances

The Bank transacts with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its own right rather than as the depository of the Government of Sri Lanka. All transactions by the Bank with the IMF have been included in these financial statements on that basis.

The Bank records the quota with the IMF as an asset and the amount payable to the IMF for quota is recorded as a liability of the Bank. The cumulative allocation of SDRs by the IMF is treated as a liability. Exchange gains and losses arising on revaluation of IMF assets and liabilities at the exchange rate applying at reporting date as published by the IMF are recognised in the Statement of Income.

All other charges and interest pertaining to balances with the IMF are recorded immediately in the Statement of Income.

3.3.6 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreign banks and financial institutions and short-term deposits.

As a part of local currency activities CBSL generates certain income and incurs expenses, which do not involve in movement of cash. Those activities result in certain assets and liabilities and mainly comprise of the transactions with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and transactions with domestic banks and financial institutions. Transactions with GOSL include the purchase of Treasury bills and bonds that are issued by the Government as a monetary policy mechanism. Such purchases, disposals or interest thereon are reflected as mere book entries in the records of CBSL. These are disclosed separately in Note 38 and Note 39 to these Financial Statements.

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues currency to the public in line with Monetary Law Act. Currency issued by CBSL represents a claim on the bank in favor of the holder. This is a liability on the part of the CBSL while it is an item of cash in the hands of the holder. Movement in circulation currency is included as part of financing activities in line with prevailing industry practices among those central banks which present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disburses cash in the form of notes and coins or cheques drawn on CBSL, to various drawees including suppliers and employees for goods and services obtained, which is either added to the Currency in Circulation liability or Deposits by Banks and Financial Institutions. Such forms of utilization of currency for the purposes of CBSL’s payments form part of cash outflows of CBSL.

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of cash/ pay order outflows.

3.3.7 Repurchase and Reverse-Repurchase Transactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be recorded as assets in the Statement of Financial Position. The obligation to repurchase (Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase) is disclosed as a liability. The difference between the sale and repurchase price in repurchase transactions and the purchase price and sale price in reverse-repurchase transactions represents an expense and income respectively and recognised in the Statement of Income.

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreements are recorded as an asset in the Statement of Financial Position (Securities Purchased under Agreements to Re-sell). Both repurchase and reverse-repurchase transactions are reported at the transaction value inclusive of any accrued income or expense.

3.3.8 Standing Deposit Facility

With effect from 01st February 2014, Standing Deposit Facility (former Standing Repurchase (Repo) Facility) was converted in to a ‘clean deposit’ with no allocation of collateral. Hence, participating institutions invest their excess funds in the Standing Deposit Facility as a clean deposit on daily basis at standing deposit facility rate.

The procedures of Standing Lending Facility (formerly Standing Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Facility) are identical to the Standing Reverse Repurchase Facility.

3.3.9 CBSL Securities

The Bank issues CBSL Securities from time to time under its Monetary Policy operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities issued are recorded as a liability. The difference between the issue price and the face value is recorded as an expense in the Statement of Income.

3.3.10 Sri Lanka Government Securities

Sri Lanka Government Securities consists of Treasury bills purchased from GOSL. The portfolio is recorded

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 15

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

in the Statement of Financial Position at amortised cost since they represent loans provided to the GOSL.

3.3.11 Advances to Government

Advances to Government represents direct provisional advances made to GOSL under Section 89 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended. These advances are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

3.3.12 Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognised and carried at amortized cost less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An allowance for doubtful debts (for loan impairment) is established if there is objective evidence that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts due. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated recoverable amount. Bad debts are written off when identified.

3.3.13 Securities Borrowings and Securities Lending

Bank borrows Government Securities from time to time under its monetary policy operations from major institutional investors. The borrowed securities are used by the Bank for repurchase operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities borrowings is an unconditional blanket guarantee from the bank for return of securities, payment of agreed fee and on compensation at market rate ( as per the market rates communicated to the primary market participants by the Public Debt Department of the Bank) in events of any failure in delivery.

The market values of the securities borrowed and not used for the repurchase operations at a particular time are recorded as a contingent liability. The commission paid is expensed on accrual basis.

Transfer of securities to counterparties under lending transactions is only reflected on the Statement of Financial Position if the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred.

3.3.14 Staff Loans

Bank employees are entitled to loan facilities under concessionary interest rates. These loans which were granted from 2008 onwards are fair valued as per IAS 39 using discounted cash flows.

Discount rate - The rate compiled by the Economic Research Department of CBSL (ERD) based on the long term inflation target on USD –Commercial Interest Reference Rate (CIRR) plus 1 per cent added for the risk premium as agreed by the Audit Committee of the Bank is used as the discount rate and it varies with the period of the loans.

The difference between the present value of the staff loans as at the end of a year and beginning of the year have been amortized yearly to record the expense incurred by the Bank in providing these loans at concessionary rates and equivalent amount is recorded as other income to record the income that would have been earned by the Bank if these loans were granted at market rates.

Assumptions used for computation of fair valuation

– The date of staff loan granted is considered as 1 January.– There were no amendments or early settlements.

3.3.15 Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset is impaired.

3.3.16 Impairment of Assets Carried at Amortised Cost

If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in the Statement of Income.

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Income, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortized cost at the reversal date.

3.3.17 Impairment of Available for Sale Investments

If an Available for Sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 16

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

principal payment and amortization) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognized in profit or loss, is transferred from equity to the Statement of Income. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as Available for Sale are not recognized in profit. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss, if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss.

3.3.18 Foreign Currency Term Liabilities

Foreign currency term liabilities are subsequently reported at the amortised cost of the liabilities. Changes in the value of these liabilities are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the term liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position. Gains and losses arising from changes in value of foreign currency term liabilities are recognised immediately as expenses in the Statement of Income. Where the liability is still owed, the gain or loss is reported as Gain /(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluation. Where the gain or loss has been realised (through repayment of the liability), this is reported as Gains /(Losses) Realised from Price Changes.

3.3.19 Other Financial Assets and Liabilities

Local and foreign currency cash, deposits and short-term advances are recognised on trade date.

3.4 Other Assets and Liabilities

3.4.1 Gold

Section 67 (1) of the Monetary Law Act which specifies the composition of the International Reserve indicates that gold may be held by the CBSL as part of this Reserve. Hence, CBSL holds Rs. 124.41 Bn (Allocated - Rs. 111.01 Bn and Non Allocated - Rs. 13.40 Bn) in gold as part of its International Reserves as at 31 December 2016. As this gold is part of the International Reserve and not used as a commodity which is traded during the normal course of business, gold is fair valued and the gains or losses are transferred to the income statement. Prior to appropriation of profits, the unrealised gains from gold are transferred to the relevant reserve account.

3.4.2 Inventories

3.4.2.1 Currency Inventory

Inventories of the Bank include new currencies that are not yet issued to the circulation. Cost related to production and design of new currency notes and coins are initially recognized at cost. Cost of new currency notes and coins which are issued to the circulation is determined on a weighted average basis and at the time of issue it is charged to Statement of Income. Allowance is made for slow moving inventories.

3.4.2.2 Other Inventories

Other inventories are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

3.4.3 Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, Plant and Equipment is stated at cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of such Property, Plant and Equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. Land and Buildings are measured at fair value less depreciation on Buildings and impairment charged subsequent to the date of the revaluation.

Except for the freehold land, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method over the following estimated useful life.

Class of AssetUseful Life

Buildings on Freehold LandOver 50 Years

Buildings on Leasehold landOver the Lease Period

Plant & Plant Integrals 20 Years

Furniture & Equipment 10 Years

Motor Vehicles5 Years

Motor Vehicles acquried 2014 onwards10 Years

Computer Hardware 4 Years

Others3 Years

The carrying values of Plant and Equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Initial recognition at cost, Land and Buildings are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation on Buildings and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Policy for revaluation of Land & Building of the Bank is at least once in five years or at any shorter interval when a significant valuation adjustment becomes evident.

Any revaluation surplus is credited to the Revaluation Reserve included in the equity section of the Statement of Financial Position, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in Statement of Income, in which case the increase is recognized in Statement of Income. A revaluation deficit is recognized in Statement of Income, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the Revaluation Reserve. Upon disposal, any revaluation surplus relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings. An item of Property, Plant and Equipment is de-recognized upon disposal or

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 17

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.

Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Income in the year the asset is de-recognized. The asset’s residual values, useful life and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, regularly.

3.4.4 Intangible Assets

Computer software not integral to computer hardware are shown as intangible assets and recognized at cost. Following initial recognition these intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization based on a useful life of 4 years.

3.4.5 Other Assets

Other assets are carried at expected realisable values.

3.4.6 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each end of reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Bank makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

3.4.7 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Bank expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

3.4.8 Currency in Circulation

Currency issued by the CBSL represents a claim on the Bank in favour of the holder. The liability for Currency in Circulation is recorded at face value in the Statement of Financial Position.

3.4.9 Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans

Pension and other Post Employment Benefit Plans operated by the Bank are disclosed in Note 45.

3.4.10 Defined Benefit Plans

The Bank operates defined benefit schemes for Pension (Old and new schemes), Widows’ and Orphans’ Pensions

(W&OP), Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pensions (WR&OP), Retirement Gratuity and Post Employment Medical Benefits. The Bank and eligible beneficiaries make contributions, to separately administered funds in respect of the first three schemes. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.

3.4.11 Defined Contribution Plans

Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. The bank contributes 24% and 3% of employees’ gross emoluments to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively which are separately administered defined contribution plans.

3.4.12 Grants

Grants recognised at their fair value (where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions, if any, will be complied with) are shown under equity. When the grant relates to an expense item it is recognised in the Statement of Income over the periods necessary to match them to the expenses it is intended to compensate on a systematic basis. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred government grant account and is released to the Statement of Income over the expected useful life of the relevant asset on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy of the related asset.

3.4.13 Personnel Expenses

Personnel Expenses include the full cost of all staff benefits. Salaries and related expenses due at year-end are included in other local payables.

3.4.14 Operating Leases

Where the Bank is the lessee, the lease rentals payable on operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Income over the term of the lease on a basis consistent with the expected benefits derived from the leased assets.

3.4.15 Taxation

The income of the Bank is exempted from tax under section 118 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 as amended.

Further, Bank is exempted from ESC as per the Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Act, No. 6 of 2013 and exempted from Value Added Tax on supply of financial services as per Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2013.

3.4.16 Revenue & Expenses

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured. Expenses are

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 18

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

recognised in the Statement of Income on the basis of a direct association between the cost incurred and the earning of specific items of income. All expenditure incurred in the running of the business and in maintaining the Property, Plant & Equipment in a state of efficiency has been charged to income in arriving at the result for the year.

The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expenses are recognised:

3.4.16.1 Interest

Interest income and expenses are recognised in the Statement of Income for all interest bearing instruments on an accrual basis using the effective yield method based on the actual purchase price unless collectability is in doubt. Interest income includes coupons earned on fixed income investments and securities and accrued discount and premium on Treasury bills and other discounted instruments. Interest income is suspended when loans become doubtful of collection. Such income is excluded from interest income until received.

3.4.16.2 Dividends

Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive the payment is established.

3.4.16.3 Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.

Net gains and losses of a revenue nature on the disposal of Property, Plant & Equipment have been accounted for in the Statement of Income, having deducted from proceeds on disposal, the carrying amount of the assets and related selling expenses.

Gains and losses arising from incidental activities to the main revenue generating activities and those arising from a group of similar transactions which are not material, are aggregated, reported and presented on a net basis.

3.4.17 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

All guarantees of indebtedness, forward foreign exchange transactions and other commitments, which are not recognised in Statement of Financial Position are shown under respective headings recognised as Contingent Liabilities and Capital commitment items. Where applicable, such amounts are measured at best estimates.

4. NATURE AND EXTENT OF ACTIVITIES

The Monetary Board of the CBSL is, in addition to determining the policies or measures authorized to

be adopted or taken under Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka as amended, vested with the powers, duties and functions of the CBSL and are generally responsible for the management, operations and administration of the Bank. The Bank is primarily responsible for the administration, supervision, regulation of monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka and also acts as the fiscal agent of the Government. The activities of the Bank mainly include:

– Implementing monetary and exchange rate polices.

– Issuing of currency.

– Facilitating free competition and stability in the financial system.

– Licensing and supervision of defined financial institutions.

– Organization and management of the inter-bank settlement system and promotion of the smooth functioning of the payment system.

– Providing loans and advances to the Government, banks and financial institutions under various facilities.

– Acting as a depository of the Government under specific arrangements with Government and agencies acting on behalf of the Government.The activities carried out in order to achieve its objective of economic, price and financial system stability with a view to encouraging and promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka can be broadly segregated into foreign currency and local currency activities. Results of these activities are taken to main Operating Activities in the context of the Statement of Income.

4.1 Foreign Currency Activities

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the CBSL’s holdings of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserves management function. The foreign reserves management portfolio comprises foreign currency assets held for foreign exchange intervention purposes and other foreign currency assets held for trading purposes.

The foreign currency assets are held in various currencies. The majority are denominated in United States Dollars, Australian Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen and New Zealand Dollars. The financial instruments held within these foreign currency portfolios consist mainly of sovereign securities, securities held under reverse-repurchase transactions or balances held with other central banks, commercial banks and custodial institutions.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 19

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

The CBSL also holds, from time-to-time, foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from international market operations.

4.2 Local Currency Activities

Local currency activities arise as follows:

(i) Liquidity management operations: Liquidity management largely involves the CBSL offsetting the daily net flows to or from government or market by advancing funds to or withdrawing funds from the banking system. Most of this business is undertaken through daily open market operations.

(ii) Holding an investment portfolio comprising Sri Lanka Government Securities to support the liability for currency in circulation. The Bank’s policy is to hold these investments for monetary operations and not for trading.

4.3 Trust and Custodial Activities

Amounts administered by the CBSL under custodial and administration arrangements are not included in these financial statements, as they do not form part of elements of financial statements of the Bank.

6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

a) The table below shows the fair values of derivative financial instruments, recorded as assets or liabilities, together with their notional amounts. The notional amount, recorded gross, is the amount of

derivative’s underlying asset, reference rate or index and is the basis upon which changes in the value of derivatives are measured. The notional amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at period end and are indicative of neither the market risk nor the credit risk.

b) The above derivatives consisting of Currency Swaps, Currency Options, Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts and Interest Rate Swaps were used for the purpose of managing market and liquidity risks in international reserves held by the Bank in line with the statutory objectives of maintenance of international reserves. In addition, the Bank entered into Swap transactions with Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), Licensed Specialized Banks (LSBs) and Foreign Central Banks in order to maintain international stability of the Sri Lankan Rupee, to strengthen the financial system of the country and to encourage those Banks to bring foreign funds.

c) Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financial instruments prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and indices.

d) A significant part of derivatives portfolio of the Bank consists of currency swaps entered into as a strategy to manage the short term liquidity requirements. In a currency swap, the Bank pays/receives a specified amount of a currency on an agreed date in exchange of another currency at agreed rates.

e) From Foreign Exchange Forward contracts, the Bank gets the obligation to buy or sell specific amount of foreign currency on an agreed future date at an agreed rate.

f) In interest rate swaps the Bank pays fixed interest rate (the swap rate) to the counterparty, while receiving floating interest rate indexed to reference rate (E.g. 3 months LIBOR + Margin) and vice versa.

g) The Bank’s exposure to derivative contracts is closely monitored as part of the overall risk management of the Bank to ensure expected benefits from such derivatives are crystalized to the Bank.

a). Holding of Special Drawing Rights

Holding of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is potentially a claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members, in that holders of SDRs can exchange their SDRs for these currencies. The SDRs value as a reserve asset derives from the commitments of members to hold and accept SDRs, and to honor various obligations connected with the operation of the SDR system. The IMF ensures that the SDRs claim on freely usable currencies is being honored in two ways: by designating IMF members with a strong external position to purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions, and through the arrangement of voluntary exchanges between participating members in a managed market. The amount shown above represents the total holding of the Bank as at the respective reporting dates.

b). IMF Quota

The IMF Quotas (capital subscriptions) are the primary source of IMF resources received from its member countries. Each country’s quota is determined broadly on the basis of the relative economic size of the country. Upon joining the IMF, a country must pay 25 per cent of its quota in widely accepted foreign currencies or SDRs, and the remaining 75 per cent in its own currency. The IMF quota represents an asset of the Bank as it transacts with the IMF on its own account on behalf of the Government as per Articles of the IMF.

The IMF, based on the General Quota Review Agreement, decided to increase the quotas of each of the IMF’s 189 members in January 2016. As a result, Sri Lanka’s IMF quota increased to SDR 578.80 Mn on 17 February 2016 from the previous quota amount of SDR 413.40 Mn. The amounts payable in respect of the IMF Quota is shown under the heading Quota Liability in Note 19. A member’s quota determines that country’s financial and organizational relationship with IMF, including:

(i) Subscriptions: A member’s subscription to IMF resources is equal to its quota and determines the maximum amount of financial resources the member is obliged to provide to the IMF. A member must pay its subscription in full; up to 25 percent must be paid in reserve assets specified by the IMF (SDRs or usable currencies), and the rest in the member’s own currency.

(ii) Voting power: The quota defines a member’s voting power in IMF decisions. IMF member’s votes are comprised of basic votes plus one additional vote for each SDR 100, 000 of quota. The 2008 reform fix the number of basic votes at 5.50 per cent of total votes.

(iii) Access to financing: The amount of financing a member can obtain from the IMF (access limits) is based on its quota. Under Stand-By and Extended Arrangements, for instance, a member can currently borrow up to 200 percent of its quota annually and 600 percent cumulatively. Access may be higher in exceptional circumstances and to meet specific problems.

(iv) SDR allocations: Members’ shares of SDR allocations are established in proportion to their quotas.

c). Deposits with IMF – PRGF – HIPC Trust Deposit

The PRGF – HIPC (Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Trust Deposit was made under the agreement between the GOSL and the IMF on 21 April 2000 by transferring SDR 788,783 from Sri Lanka’s deposit in the post SCA-2 (Special Contingent Account) administered account with the IMF.This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC loan. Accordingly, GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA –2 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018.

d). The Special Drawing Right (SDR) is a reserve asset created by the IMF in order to meet a long-term global need to supplement existing reserve assets. SDRs are allocated to member countries in proportion to their IMF quotas. SDR allocations can only be made to countries that participate in the IMF’s SDR Department (an accounting unit within the IMF). The IMF created SDRs to supplement existing official reserve assets such as gold holdings, foreign exchange and reserve positions in the IMF. Under certain conditions, which are set in the Articles of Agreement signed on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka by the Bank, the IMF may allocate SDRs to members in proportion to their IMF quotas. An allocation of SDRs by the IMF provides each member with a costless asset on which interest is neither earned nor paid. The Articles of Agreement also allow for cancellations of SDRs, but to date, this provision has not been used. Increases in Allocation of SDR represents increases in Holding of SDR as described in Note 7. Members of IMF are obligated to pay to the IMF an amount equal to its net cumulative allocation and any other amounts that may be due and payable because of its participation in the Special Drawing Rights Department at the point of termination or liquidation of IMF’s SDR Department.

e). Other Amounts Payable to IMF represent amounts owed by the Bank to IMF on account of operational and administrative transactions.

f). Quota Liability is the amount payable in respect of the IMF Quota as described in Note 7, which is shown under the heading Quota Liability.

43. RISK MANAGEMENT

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has two statutory objectives, i.e., economic and price stability and financial system stability. The CBSL has been assigned with wide statutory powers to implement economic and financial policies to secure its objectives. The Monetary Board, the Governing Board of the CBSL is responsible for making all policy decisions related to the management, operations and administration of the Bank. The CBSL’s operations and policies are not aimed towards generating profits. However, it is exposed to a number of risks in the course of carrying out its functions. Therefore, the bank’s management ensures that strong and effective risk management and control systems are in place. In this regard, the Monetary Board has delegated the task of risk management to departments and committees with a view to ensure effective management and control of risks. Therefore, risk management is a responsibility of all levels of decision making at the CBSL.

Managing risks at the CBSL is conducted under a ‘Three Lines of Defense’ model. Accordingly, the responsibility of the ‘First Line of Defense’ rests with the respective departments. The risks coming under the ‘First Line of Defense’ are operational in nature, so that such risks are managed by departments where they are originated. The ‘First Line of Defense’ would ensure proper internal risk management systems and controls are in place. The Risk Management Department (RMD) as the ‘Second Line of Defense’ is responsible for assessing, controlling and monitoring of financial risks and independently reporting to the Governor. Internal Audit Department is entrusted with the responsibility of performing the risk assurance function as the ‘Third Line of Defense’.

The two major dimensions of risks are financial risks and non-financial risks. Financial Risk includes market risk (interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The RMD carries out risk assessments, monitoring and reporting of financial risks relating to the CBSL’s foreign reserves portfolio while the International Operations Department (IOD) of the CBSL manages the foreign reserves portfolio. A comprehensive set of guidelines incorporating risk mitigation policies are followed by IOD in managing reserves portfolio. Financial risk assessments relating to international reserves are independently reported to the Governor and the Monetary Board.

Interest rate risk or the exposure of the Bank’s foreign assets portfolio to movements in the interest rate is monitored through modified duration of the portfolio as well as Value at Risk (VaR) for a time horizon of 10 days and a confidence level of 99 per cent. The foreign exchange risk or the capital loss as a consequence of fluctuations in the exchange rates is managed mainly through diversification of investment currencies. In order to mitigate liquidity risk, limits to asset classes, a maximum purchasing limit over total amount issued by the issuers of the securities are considered in the Strategic Assets Allocation (SAA). In the management of foreign reserves, minimizing liquidity risk is the prime consideration in order to maintain an effective foreign exchange intervention capability. Policies for managing the credit, interest rate, foreign exchange and liquidity risks are outlined in sections 43.1, 43.2, 43.3 & 43.4, respectively.

A Counterparty Credit Risk Management System (CCRMS) is used to manage the credit risk of the foreign assets portfolio based on the credit ratings of

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 33

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

the investments and the counterparties. In addition, Money Market Counterparties’ Credit Default Swaps (CDS) /Stock prices are monitored by the RMD on a continuous basis.

Assessing, monitoring and reporting of financial risk pertaining to investments by internal investment funds of the Central Bank is also carried out by the RMD. Internal Investment Fund of the CBSL is currently managed under the Finance Department as the “Front Office” and the RMD monitors the risks pertaining to the investments of the internal fund on an ongoing basis. RMD submits status reports of the fund independently to the Governor on an ongoing basis, provides Finance Department with risk related inputs to improve the Investment Process and Investment Policy Statement, etc., to ensure capital preservation and the adequacy of liquidity of the fund at all times.

Non-Financial risk includes legal risk, compliance risk, human resource risk, fraud risk, strategic and policy risk and other operational risks. Monitoring non-financial risk would ensure a risk compliance of work procedures, rules and guidelines as well as proper risk governance of the bank. In view of this, Non-Financial Risk Management Committee (NFRMC) at its quarterly meetings, oversees the non-financial risk of the Bank. The Committee is chaired by the Governor and selected key departments that have relatively high exposure to risk, are members of the committee. The Director of Internal Audit Department acts as an observer. The principle objective of NFRMC is to assist the Monetary Board in its responsibility to identify, assess (in terms of impact and likelihood) and monitor non-financial risk of the Bank, in order to safeguard Bank’s reputation and mitigate any losses and damages. The Committee also reviews and assesses the quality, integrity and effectiveness of the risk management process and internal control procedures.

The internal controls and the risk management process are audited annually by the IAD of the Bank. It examines the adequacy of the procedures and the Bank’s compliance with the procedures. All departments are subject to periodic internal audit review. The IAD reports administratively to the Governor who is the chairman of the Monetary Board and functionally to the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (AAC).

AAC is chaired by an appointed member of the Monetary Board. AAC advises the Monetary Board on matters relating to the integrity of the financial statements of the Bank, including its annual and any other reports, interim management statements and any other formal announcements relating to its financial performance, reviewing significant financial reporting issues and judgements which they contain, internal controls and risk management systems, the adequacy and effectiveness of the compliance function of the Bank, the effectiveness of the internal audit function of the Bank and related matters and external audit related matters. The recommendations of AAC and progress of IAD are reported to the Monetary Board quarterly.

The Bank is subject to an external audit by the Auditor General under the Monetary Law Act sections 42 & 43.

The Auditor General in turn has obtained the services of a firm of Chartered Accountants M/s Ernst & Young to carry out an audit under International Standards of Auditing to ensure compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.

(c) Credit Exposure by Credit Rating

The following table represents the credit ratings of respective financial assets or issuers, based on the ratings of Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Under Standard & Poor’s ratings and Fitch Ratings, AAA is the highest quality rating possible and indicates the lowest expectations of credit risk. It is assigned only in the case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitment. AA is very high quality grade, indicating very low expectation of credit risk, and A is an upper medium grade, indicating a low expectation of credit risk; BBB is the lowest investment grade rating, indicating that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk and exhibits adequate protection parameters, ratings lower than AAA can be modified by + or – signs to indicate relative standing within the major categories. NR indicates that Standard and Poor’s or Fitch Rating have not rated the entity.

43.2 Interest Rate Risk

(a) Foreign Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from the changes in interest rates.

The interest rate sensitivity of the Fixed Income Securities portfolio, except the investment in Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP), measured by the potential loss incurred due to a rise in interest rate by 10 basis points is another risk measure used by the Bank. Sensitivity of the risk exposure of the segmented Fixed Income Securities Portfolio is given below:

Portfolio SegmentPotential Loss ( USD Mn)20162015Trading and Available for Sale5.168.35RAMP0.03 -

RMD manages the interest rate risk of the foreign assets portfolio by employing the following strategies:i) While the interest rate sensitivity measures the effect of a change in the interest rates on the foreign assets portfolio, the Bank uses Modified Duration (MD) as a measurement of interest rate risk which considers interest rates as well as the duration of an investment. The MD measures the change in price of a security for a given change in the interest rates (yield). A higher MD indicates a higher risk. Hence, the bank set an appropriate MD from time to time considering the developments in the financial markets, portfolio characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio. The MDs of the foreign assets portfolio are tabulated below:

Modified Duration

Investment SegmentModified Duration20162015Capital Market (Fixed Income Securities)2.263.28

RAMP1.42 -

ii) Since the MD does not account for large changes in prices, another measure used for management of interest rate risk of the foreign reserves portfolio is convexity. Convexity measures the extent of deviation in bond price-yield curve from a straight line representing duration. It allows improving the duration approximation for bond price changes. Convexity is a change in Duration for a change in yield. It measures the predictive error of Modified Duration.

iii) Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR summarizes in a single number, the downside risk of the portfolio, under normal market conditions, from financial market movements. Therefore, VaR is the maximum loss over a target horizon such that there is a low, pre-specified probability that the actual loss will be larger. VaR gives a number, in terms of money, which can be aggregated across risks and positions. The Bank uses historical simulation method to calculate VaR number for 10 days period at 99% confidence interval. The historical method for estimating VaR is sometimes referred to as the historical simulation method. As an example to calculate the 5% daily VaR using the historical method is to accumulate a number of past daily returns, rank the returns from highest to lowest, and identify the lowest 5% of returns. The highest of these lowest 5% of returns is the 1-day, 5% VaR.

iv) Trading & Open Position Limits

Bank assigns specific dealer limits on intra-day and overnight position limits for individual dealers by way of “Dealing Authority “.

Interest rate risk measures related to the investments in the Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP) is reported to the Foreign Reserve Management Committee on a regular basis.

(b) Local Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

The local Treasury bills portfolio is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position of the Bank at amortized cost as it represents loans provided to the Government of Sri Lanka. This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Treasury bills with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Treasury bills to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Treasury bills in the Bank’s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank’s actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Treasury bill portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank’s Treasury bill portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the bank’s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets.

43.3 Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the Bank’s holding of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserve management function. Volatility of the foreign exchange markets may expose the Bank to exchange risk. The Monetary Board and Foreign Reserves Management Committee (FRMC) have set percentage holdings of different currencies in its International

Reserves. In deciding on the currency allocation, public debt repayment requirements are given due consideration. Accordingly, the Bank holds most major currencies such as US Dollars, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen, Euro, Australian Dollars and New Zealand Dollars. Compliance with limits established for foreign currency positions are monitored.

43.5 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the difficulty that an entity will encounter in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk is also the risk that an entity will have to sell a financial asset quickly at much less than its fair value.

a) Liquidity is a key consideration in determining the composition of the Bank’s foreign currency assets. This reflects the potential requirement to liquidate foreign reserves for intervention purposes and to settle other commitments such as public debt and IMF Loan repayments when the need arises. The Bank has adopted the following measures aimed at ensuring quick access to funds:

• Liquid asset ratios based on the liquidity characteristics of securities held

• Limits on maximum proportion of reserves that may be held in one currency and with one counterparty

b) In order to reduce the level of liquidity risk arising out of the local currency activities, particularly open market operations, the Bank uses highly liquid marketable instruments such as Treasury Bills & Treasury Bonds as collateral. It manages the daily liquidity position of the banking system by way of infusing into or withdrawal from the system, using instruments such as repo / reverse repo, CBSL securities & USD /LKR Swaps.

Employees under these plans who were recruited before 1 August 1994 contribute 5% of the monthly basic salary & employees who were recruited on or after 01 August 1994 10% of monthly basic salary.

The Bank also provides gratuity benefits to employees who have completed five years of service in the Bank and who are not eligible for a monthly pension payment under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes. In order to meet this liability, a provision is carried forward in the Statement of Financial Position, equivalent to the liability calculated using the actuarial valuation.

The Bank has a Post-Employment Medical Benefit Scheme which provides reimbursement of certain medical expenses incurred by retired employees on account of themselves or their spouses and by widows/widowers.

45. PENSION AND OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Bank operates six defined benefit plans which cover all eligible employees. Under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Scheme (old), employees who joined the Bank prior to 1 January 1998 and complete 10 years of service become eligible to the schemes. The employees who have joined the Bank after 1st January 1998 and complete 10 years of service become eligible for the new pension scheme. These Pension Schemes are non-contributory pension schemes where the cost of benefits is wholly borne by the Bank. The Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for male employees and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for female employees are open to employees of the Bank who had joined prior to 1 January 1998. Eligible

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 47

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

The Bank employed an Independent Actuary M/s K. A. Pandit, Consultant & Actuary (Mumbai) to re-assess the defined benefit obligations and the current service costs attributable to the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme during the year.

Funds of the Employee Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme are managed separately and separate books are maintained. However, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme are not separated

from the books of accounts of the Bank. Further, investments and investment income are recorded separately for these funds in the Bank books and the income earned from the investments are transferred back to these funds and reinvested without being distributed.

The total fair value of plan assets of Rs.36,145.06 Mn (2015 – Rs. 36,912.71 Mn) exceed the total present value of all benefit obligations of Rs. 36,065.09 Mn (2015 – Rs. 45,682.71 Mn) at the end of the reporting period resulting in a surplus of Rs. 79.97 Mn (2015 – Deficit of Rs. 8,770.00 Mn).

The balance shown under Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans in Statement of Financial Position differs from the net liability as per the actuary due to the following reasons:a) The net asset position of the Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension scheme are not reflected in the accounts due to the remote possibility of distributing any residual balance of the fund to the Bank.b) For both gratuity and medical benefit schemes, the accounts represent the gross liability position and not the net liability as per actuary, since the Bank does not keep relevant assets in a separate fund (internally maintained).

There are uncollateralized investments under Pension, Widows’ and Orphans’ scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ scheme, Gratuity and Medical Benefit support fund worth of Rs. 445.53 Mn for which 100% provision has been made and thus not included in the value of plan assets. Even without the value of such investments, bank has a net asset position under its pension liability as per actuarial valuation.

46. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

a) Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When a financial instrument is traded in an organised and liquid market that is able to absorb a significant transaction without moving the price against the trader, quoted market values represent the fair value.

The Bank uses the following hierarchy for determining

and disclosing the fair value of assets and liabilities by valuation technique :

Level 1: Quoted (un-adjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;Level 2 : Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable , either directly or indirectly;Level 3 : Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data;The following table shows an analysis of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value hierarchy:

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016Part II - 50

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Land & Building

Valuation MethodLand is valued using market approach with direct comparison method, whereby assets are compared to recent sales with no added or nominal added improvement value, making adjustments for points of difference to derive the fair value.

Depreciated Current Replacement Cost (DRC) method is used in valuing all the buildings except Central Point, White Aways and Lloyds Building, considering that the assets controlled by the public sector entities that provide service to the community are not traded on an open liquid market.

Income approach is used to value the other buildings which values the property based on estimated future income, profits or cash flow that are converted (discounted) to a single current amount.

Derivatives

Derivative valuation models use forward prices (calculated by extrapolating the forward points available in the market) and discount rates calculated based on zero coupon yield curves of the respective currencies as of the valuation date. If the instrument that is valued contains a margin, adjustments are made to the forward prices and/or the interest rates to represent the impact of the margin rate.

Embedded Derivatives - Currency Options

Fair value of the embedded derivative products was calculated using Black-Scholes model.

5. CURRENCY

The Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949 (MLA), vests in the Monetary Board the sole right and authority to issue currency which is the legal tender in Sri Lanka. The Currency Department (CRD) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka handles functions relating to this statutory responsibility of the Monetary Board. CRD carries out the key tasks relating to printing of currency notes, minting of coins, issuing currency notes and coins to meet public demand, accepting currency deposits from Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), withdrawing unfit currency notes and coins from circulation, assisting law enforcement authorities to deal with instances of violations of the provisions of MLA with respect to the legal tender and conducting public awareness programmes to enhance public knowledge in proper use of currency preserving its quality.

5.1. Currency Issuance (Management)

a) Currency in Circulation

Demand for currency notes and coins increased in 2016 in line with the economic growth and inflation in Sri Lankan economy, notwithstanding the continued facilitation of technology driven non-cash modes of payment. Accordingly, the value of total currency in circulation increased by 12.4 per cent to Rs. 552.2 billion as at 31.12.2016 over the previous year as shown in Table II-5.

d) Clean Note Policy

CRD continued with its effort to ensure regular supply of good quality (fit) currency notes and disposal of soiled (unfit) currency notes. In 2016, CRD destroyed 179.2 million pieces of unserviceable currency notes deposited by LCBs amounting to a face value of Rs. 57.4 billion and reissued in to circulation 279.4 million pieces of serviceable currency notes amounting to Rs 455.6 billion.

CRD conducted meetings with cash managers of LCBs to discuss issues and barriers in improving efficient and effective currency management and operations among LCBs and matters relating to developments in the currency sorting and handling practices to extend the effective life of currency notes. Further, the LCBs were informed on the strict law enforcement on currency notes mutilation, alteration and defacement and instructed them to educate their staff on identifying wilfully mutilated, altered or defaced currency notes and to educate the public to refrain from wilful mutilation, alteration and defacement.

e) Issue of Commemorative Coins and Sales of Commemorative Collector Items

During 2016, CRD received five requests to issue commemorative coins. Four of these requests were

considered favourably and issuance of two coins would take place in 2017. Further, commemorative collector items were sold through the Central Bank Regional Offices and the Economic History Museum in Fort, Colombo.

5.2 Currency Printing and Minting

In order to meet the demand for currency notes in the economy, ensure good quality notes in circulation, and to ensure sufficient contingency stocks, CRD made arrangements to print 775 million pieces of currency notes. In addition, arrangements were made to mint 575 million pieces of coins during 2016.

CRD has taken steps to reduce the cost of minting coins by changing the metal type of Rupee 1 (minted after 2005) and Rupees 5 coins from brass plated steel to stainless steel. Further, arrangements were made to design a new set of circulation standard coins from stainless steel metal for the denominations of Rupee 1, Rupees 2, Rupees 5 and Rupees 10 reducing the sizes of coins with the objectives of reducing the cost of minting and easy handling.

5.3 System Improvements

In 2016, actions was taken to complete the procurement and installation of an offline currency note disintegrator. The new disintegrator has facility efficiently facilitates bulk disintegration of damage and unfit currency notes in a safe and environment friendly manner. Further, automation of currency processing has been introduced by installing a shrink wrapping system to securely handle the output of two fully automated currency note processing machines by minimizing manual intervention.

5.4 Assistance Provided to Law Enforcement Authorities

In 2016, CRD took the following actions to assist law enforcement authorities regarding violation of the provisions of MLA on counterfeiting of currency;

a) Closely co-operated with the Counterfeit Currency Bureau of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Sri Lanka Police and law enforcement authorities pertaining to counterfeiting attempts. 2,612 counterfeit notes were detected in 2016.

b) Endorsed and issued 162 certificates with the signature of the Governor as conclusive evidence for imitation of currency notes to facilitate proceedings in courts.

c) Attended 12 court cases to give evidence on currency counterfeiting cases.

5.5 Public Awareness

c) Facilitated about 9,470 visitors mainly school children, tourists and general public at the three currency museums of the Central Bank and distributed information material and leaflets highlighting the clean note policy and consequences of counterfeiting currency notes to educate the public.

5.6 Approvals for Reproduction of Currency

During 2016, four approvals were granted for reproduction of currency notes in advertisements, in terms of the policy approved by the Monetary Board for such reproduction.

6. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

6.1 Functions of Domestic Operations Department (DOD)

DOD is entrusted with several functions, as provided for in the Monetary Law Act (MLA). They are (a) conducting Open Market Operations (OMO), (b) regulation of the reserves of commercial banks, (c) acting as the banker to and the official depository of the government, government agencies and other institutions acting on behalf of the government, (d) directing provisional advances to the government, (e) maintaining accounts for direct dealers and direct participants, (f) provision of intraday credit to the participants and (g) engaging in credit operations with banking institutions, as and when necessary.

6.2 Implementation of Monetary Policy

The Department continued to implement monetary policy with the objective of maintaining short-term interest rates at a level commensurate with the prevailing monetary policy stance of the Central Bank. Accordingly, the average weighted call money rate (AWCMR) was maintained at an appropriate level within the policy rate corridor formed by the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR), with minimum volatility, although it breached the upper bound of the policy rate corridor on certain days during 2016.

In steering the AWCMR towards the desired level, the DOD relied on OMO as the main monetary operation tool, while standing facilities were also continuously made available to market participants. In addition, the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) also played a crucial role in making permanent adjustments to the liquidity position of the market. In 2016, commercial banks, given the period of two weeks for reserve calculation and maintenance, effectively managed their daily liquidity, minimising volatility in interest rates in the call money market.

6.3 Behavior of Short Term Interest Rates

The inter-bank money market had a high level of excess liquidity at the beginning of the year mainly due to Treasury bill purchases by the Central Bank. This excess liquidity was absorbed on a temporary basis through short-term and long-term repo auctions and on a permanent basis by way of outright sales of Treasury bills. In addition, the Central Bank increased the SRR applicable to all rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks by 1.50 percentage points to 7.50 per cent with effect from 16 January 2016, by way of which Rs. 52 billion was absorbed. Foreign exchange related transactions of the Central Bank meanwhile also drained rupee liquidity. Hence, the excess rupee liquidity in the domestic money market declined gradually and there was a deficit in market liquidity by end March 2016. The deficit in market liquidity continued until the latter part of December. During this period, the Central Bank conducted reverse repo auctions on most of the days. Money market liquidity turned positive again during the latter part of December, mainly due to foreign exchange related transactions of the Central Bank and foreign loan disbursements, and by end December 2016, excess market liquidity amounted to Rs. 39.2 billion compared to an excess of Rs. 81.7 billion at end December 2015.

The Central Bank raised its policy interest rates, viz., the SDFR and SLFR, by 50 basis points each on 19 February 2016 and 28 July 2016 to 7.00 per cent and 8.50 per cent, respectively. The AWCMR which was at 6.40 per cent at end 2015 showed an upward trend at the beginning of 2016. It increased rapidly towards the upper bound of the policy rate corridor following the initial policy rate adjustment of the year. With further declines in market liquidity, from end March the AWCMR breached the upper bound of the corridor, as a result of the distortion created by the tax applicable to interest income from secondary market transactions in government securities, and hovered around 8.20 per cent until the next policy interest rate change in July. Since a significantly large market interest rate adjustment was realised with the previous policy rate revision, a relatively lower adjustment in the AWCMR was seen within the corridor following the policy rate change in July. At end 2016, the AWCMR was 8.42 per cent. The average daily call market volume was Rs. 14.5 billion in 2016 and fluctuated in a range of Rs. 2.99 billion and Rs. 25.05 billion. A few banks resorted to borrowing persistently in the call money market. In terms of the distribution of call borrowing, around 77 per cent of the total borrowing was accounted for by 4 banks.

The Average Weighted Repo Rate (AWRR) followed the movements in the AWCMR closely. It increased gradually during the first quarter of 2016 and hovered around 8.00 per cent thereafter until the policy interest rates were increased

in July. Having increased in response to the tightening of the monetary policy stance, it recorded the highest level of 9.15 per cent by mid-October. While it also fluctuated with the level of market liquidity, at end 2016, it stood at 8.62 per cent. The AWRR excluding the transactions of one primary dealer (which had to effect transactions at off-market rates due to a solvency problem) remained close to the upper bound of the policy rate corridor, i.e., 8.50 per cent, in the latter part of December 2016.

The notional tax credit on repo transactions, which created issues in short term interest rates, will be removed with effect from 01 April 2017, in line with the implementation of the relevant proposals in the national Budget for 2017. This will ensure that the policy rate corridor will provide the effective upper and lower bounds for the AWCMR.

DOD conducted auctions for the outright sale of Treasury bills during the first two months of 2016 to absorb excess liquidity on a permanent basis. DOD conducted 9 outright sales auctions offering Rs. 60.0 billion and bids amounting to Rs. 39.60 billion were accepted at 6 auctions at weighted average yield rates ranging from 6.47 per cent to 6.77 per cent. At 3 auctions, all bids were rejected due to low rates offered by the PIs.

Due to the deficit in market liquidity that prevailed, auctions for outright purchases of Treasury bills were conducted to

inject liquidity into the market on a permanent basis from the latter part of November 2016 onwards. DOD conducted 78 outright purchase auctions with an offered volume of Rs.165 billion, and bids amounting to Rs. 15.8 billion at 15 auctions were accepted at weighted average yield rates ranging between 8.65 per cent and 9.95 per cent. At 16 auctions, all bids were rejected due to the high rates offered by the PIs. For the balance auctions, there was no response from the market.

6.3.2. Standing Facility

Standing facilities were provided throughout the year at the SDFR and the SLFR to PIs which were unable to meet their short term liquidity requirements fully through the inter-bank money market and daily OMO auctions. SDF transactions amounted to a daily average of Rs. 23.1 billion and a total of Rs. 5,572.7 billion during the year 2016. The total volume lent under the SLF was Rs. 3,208.3 billion in 2016 with a daily average volume of Rs. 15.8 billion.

6.3.3. Statutory Reserve Requirement

The SRR is the minimum amount of reserves that each commercial bank is required to hold in terms of the regulations of the Central Bank, in the reserve account with the Central Bank, in proportion to the total rupee deposit liabilities of each bank. DOD was responsible for both administering the maintenance of SRR and monitoring compliance by commercial banks. With the objective of constraining undue expansion of monetary aggregates which could fuel future inflation in the economy, the SRR was revised upward by 1.50 percentage points to 7.50 per cent in December 2015 to be effective from 16 January 2016. As a result, about Rs. 52.0 billion of excess liquidity was absorbed from the money market at the beginning of 2016.

6.3.4. Bank Rate

The Central Bank’s rate of interest (Bank rate) on short term advances to LCBs, stipulated under Section 87 of the MLA, remained unchanged at 15 per cent. However, no bank resorted to borrowing from the Central Bank at that rate.

6.4 Banker to Commercial Banks and the Government

6.4.1. Accounts of Financial Institutions

Performing the functions relating to the Central Bank’s role as the banker to banks, the DOD continued to provide current account facilities to LCBs and Primary Dealers (PDs) for Government Securities to ensure an efficient interbank payment and settlement system. At the end of 2016, the Central Bank maintained accounts for 25 LCBs and 8 PDs. These accounts were operated on a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) basis.

6.4.2 Government Accounts

Performing the functions relating to the Central Bank’s role as the banker to the Government, the DOD continued to maintain the accounts of government departments, agencies and statutory boards, and provided the required banking facilities to them. The total number of accounts maintained by the Central Bank amounted to 61 as at end 2016. Accordingly, the DOD handled 22,730 transactions amounting to Rs. 14,963.3 billion, during the year, on behalf of the Government. More than 90 per cent of such transactions were in relation to the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury (DST) Account, the Public Debt Department’s Current Account, the Inland Revenue Commissioner’s VAT Refund Account and the President’s Fund Account.

In terms of Section 89 of the MLA, the Central Bank provides provisional advances to the Government, free of charge, with a ceiling of 10 per cent of the estimated government revenue approved by the Parliament for a given fiscal year. At the beginning of 2016, the amount of the provisional advance was increased by Rs. 31.9 billion to Rs. 185.1 billion based on the government’s revenue estimated for the year 2016 and approved by the Parliament, compared to that of Rs. 153.2 billion for the year 2015.

6.5 Provision of Intra-Day Liquidity Facility (ILF)

DOD ensured smooth and efficient functioning of the RTGS system by providing ILF to PIs. This facility was provided free of charge against the collateral of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, which were valued at their current market prices with a sufficient hair cut to absorb any variations in market prices during the day.

February 2013, considering the importance of the Money Brokers’ role in the price discovery process in the money markets (money, foreign exchange and government securities). A total of 9 companies were issued the “Certificate of Authorisation” under this regulation and were designated as “Authorised Money Brokers”. As per regulation 20 of the Money Broking Regulation No.01 of 2016, the DOD introduced an online system for money brokers to report all data relating to transactions handled by them in order to improve the monitoring of money market activities. Accordingly, all transactions in the money market mediated through money brokers, relevant quotes together with the names of counterparties are required to be updated on a real time basis. DOD conducted 9 on-site examinations of 9 money broking companies during the year while 6 meetings were held with Boards of Directors of these companies. The number of authorised money brokers remained unchanged during 2016.

7. ECONOMIC RESEARCH

Economic Research Department (ERD) is one of the key departments legally established at the time of the inception of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act (MLA) of 1949. According to Section 25 of the MLA, the responsibilities of preparing data and conducting economic research, for the guidance of the Monetary Board and the Governor in formulating, implementing, and executing policies and measures and for the information of the public, in the subjects of money and banking and other economic subjects of general interest are vested with the ERD. ERD carried out its duties in the areas of monetary policy and external sector policies to support the Central Bank’s efforts in maintaining economic and price stability, as well as facilitating the Bank’s role as the economic policy advisor to the government. ERD continued to conduct research on topical issues, publish statutory publications on behalf of the Central Bank, disseminate information and data to all stakeholders of the economy including the general public, and maintain a close relationship with international organisations on behalf of the government.

7.1 Maintaining Economic and Price Stability

In order to fulfill its responsibility of facilitating the Central Bank in the maintenance of economic and price stability, ERD continued to closely monitor the trends and developments in the external, fiscal, monetary and real sectors of the domestic economy as well as the global economy. Comprehensive analyses were compiled based on this ongoing surveillance, macroeconomic statistics and macroeconometric projections, and submitted with timely policy recommendations to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), enabling the MPC to provide forward looking guidance to the Monetary Board on the direction of monetary policy that is conducive to the creation of economic growth in a low inflation environment. As key inputs for this decision making process, ERD continued to provide projections of the path of headline and core inflation, estimations of potential output and output gap measures and the movements of broad money and credit aggregates. The Monetary Board was also provided with ongoing appraisals of potential risks to the achievement of the projected path of key macroeconomic variables stemming from both domestic and international volatilities, and appropriate policy measures were proposed. Subsequent to the announcement in the Annual Report 2015 of the Central Bank’s pursuit of an enhanced monetary policy framework, ERD continued to engage in the formal appraisal of key economic stakeholders on the proposed transition plan towards a Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework over the medium term. As an essential element of this transition, ERD jointly worked with a technical team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during 2016 to build a Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS). Accordingly, three Technical Assistance missions were coordinated by ERD and attended by selected staff members in the Economic Policy Advisory cluster of the Central Bank. The focus of these missions was on the strengthening of technical capabilities of the Central Bank staff on macroeconomic model building and forecasting. In order to continue phased implementation of this system, an inter-departmental Modelling and Forecasting Unit (MFU) was formed in May 2016 with ERD staff holding several key responsibilities. As a cornerstone in the implementation of FPAS, MFU jointly prepared medium-term projections with the IMF team, and presented its findings and policy recommendations at a special MPC meeting. In recognition of the need for institutional commitment for the continuation of these efforts, the Modelling and Forecasting Division (MFD) was permanently established in ERD. The MFD is entrusted with the responsibilities of further developing and implementing the FPAS, preparing a Financial Programme for Sri Lanka, and conducting model based policy analysis and research along with other Divisions in ERD. During the year, ERD also commenced upgrading the compilation of monetary statistics in line with the IMF’s latest Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Accordingly, ERD coordinated a Technical Assistance mission from the IMF in July 2016

Part II - 70

Part II

wherein the standardised reporting formats (SRFs) for the Central Bank and other depository corporations were introduced and staff were oriented into the process of developing an integrated monetary database that will meet the analytical needs of the Central Bank. Following technical assistance, the Central Bank commenced the reporting of monetary and financial statistics based on SRFs to the IMF.

7.2 Maintaining External Sector Stability

With the view of supporting the maintenance of external sector stability of the economy, ERD continued to collect, compile and analyse economic statistics related to international trade and finance while conducting comprehensive assessments of the domestic economy and global economic developments and providing appropriate policy recommendations. Developments in the external sector, as reflected in the external sector statistics and the movements of nominal and real exchange rates were also reported to the MPC and the Monetary Board on a monthly basis to be considered and addressed in tandem with other sectoral developments. Apart from analysing and providing observations on various external sector related matters, ERD continued to evaluate monetary policy implications of a number of foreign loans that were obtained by the government, as per the provisions of the MLA.

Further, ERD played a key role in informing the Monetary Board on the potential risks in the external sector through regular and occasional Board Papers. Having provided technical inputs for securing the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of SDR 1.1 billion (approximately USD 1.5 billion) from the IMF in June 2016, ERD formally updated the Monetary Board on the progress in relation to the performance criteria, indicative targets and structural benchmarks agreed upon under the Programme.

Numerous initiatives undertaken by ERD in the past to improve the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics were continued during the year. ERD continued to publish Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics in the BPM6 format on a quarterly basis, while making timely submissions relevant to Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) of the World Bank and direct investment data to the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS), while publishing the International Reserve Data Template (RDT). During the year, ERD also successfully disseminated data according to the Advance Release Calendar, which is one of the essential SDDS requirements. In order to ensure accuracy and timeliness of data, ERD conducted several surveys as part of the Annual International Investment Survey (AIIS) and continued to broaden its coverage to reach 1,600 companies in 2016. These surveys collected data on foreign assets and liabilities of the private sector and statistics related to the services sector. The monthly survey on inward remittances of foreign exchange was also continued.

7.3 Providing Proactive Policy Advice

In 2016, ERD continued to provide proactive policy advice to the senior management and to the government mainly on monetary policy, exchange rate policy and fiscal sector related issues. As in previous years, the ERD submitted the September 15th Report to the Hon. Minister of Finance in accordance with Section 116(1) of the MLA. While highlighting the developments in the economy over the first nine months of the year, this confidential report also identified issues in the economy and made policy prescriptions to serve as a policy guide in the preparation of the government’s budget. In addition, ERD provided policy assessment and advice to the Hon. Minister of Finance as statutorily required under various sections of the MLA.

The ERD staff continued to actively serve as members in numerous committees and boards of several external institutions. These included committees and boards of national importance such as those related to the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI), National Science Foundation, Ceylon Electricity Board, Tender Boards and Technical Evaluation Committees on International Sovereign Bond issuances and in securing Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility, Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Coordinating Committee, Non-Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRE) Tariff Committee, Water Supply and Sanitation Coverage Committee and in the Team to Study Co-operative Rural Banks.

Further, in addition to serving in the MPC of the Central Bank which is coordinated by ERD, senior officers of ERD continued to engage in sharing their expertise at a number of internal committees such as the Market Operations Committee (MOC), the Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC), Investment Oversight Committee (IOC)/Investment Committee (IC), Foreign Reserve Management Committee (FRMC), Library Advisory Committee (LAC) and Research Publications Committee (RPC). They also continued to serve in several inter-departmental teams to provide their technical expertise and experience.

7.4 Statutory Publications and Dissemination of Data and Information

The primary responsibility of releasing statutory publications of the Central Bank is vested with ERD. Accordingly, two key annual publications were completed by ERD with the contribution and support of other departments. Fulfilling the requirements of Section 35 of the MLA, Annual Report 2015 was published in all three languages within the specified time frame with comprehensive analysis on economic developments, issues and challenges and policy priorities covering all areas of the economy along with accounts and operations of the Central Bank, major administrative measures taken by the Monetary Board and major legal enactments related to central banking, and statistical appendices. The interim review of the economy, Recent

Part II - 71

Economic Developments: Highlights of 2016 and Prospects for 2017, was also published in all three languages in November 2016. In addition, in December 2016, the ERD prepared the Road Map: Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2017 and Beyond, which was announced at the beginning of 2017.

Meanwhile, ERD continued to compile and disseminate a vast array of data and information for the benefit of all the stakeholders of the economy. This includes monthly statistical bulletins encompassing data related to all sectors of the economy, inputs to monthly and weekly economic indicators, and monthly press releases on the monetary policy stance of the Central Bank and external sector developments, among other regular data updates through the Central Bank website. Apart from these, ERD also issued press releases on several events in the economy which were of interest to the public.

7.5 Engaging in Policy Research and Knowledge Sharing

As a premier economic research institution in the country, ERD engaged in several policy related research activities on current economic issues and policies to apprise the MPC and the Monetary Board. The senior management was regularly updated on the state of the economy, issues, challenges and vulnerabilities, and potential policy direction through information series board papers, monetary policy board papers, observation reports and presentations.

The Research Advisory Panel (RAP), an internal committee responsible for all research related tasks, continued to facilitate enhancing the research culture within the Department and the Central Bank as a whole. ERD continued the publication of the Central Bank’s official research publication, Staff Studies, including research outcomes of officers attached to ERD and other Departments. In addition, a number of ERD seminars were conducted within the Department by sector specialists to encourage knowledge sharing on technical and contemporary developments in the field of economics. Further, six groups of interns from various higher education institutes visited ERD during the latter part of the year and all the Divisions of ERD actively engaged in educating them on practical aspects of economics and central banking. In collaboration with Human Resources Department/Training and Development Department, ERD organised Economic Fora and Public Lectures on various topics of interest to central bankers and the general public while facilitating the recommencement of Structured High Level Training Programmes by the Central Bank.

The RAP successfully organised the 9th International Research Conference (IRC) of the Central Bank, providing a forum for distinguished researchers and academics to present their work on contemporary macroeconomic issues. IRC 2016 was held under the theme of “Sustainable Development and Macroeconomic Policies in a Challenging Global

and Domestic Environment.” The keynote address was delivered by Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, former Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission of the Republic of India. As in previous years, IRC 2016 continued to attract a large number of high quality research papers from distinguished academic and policy making institutions in Advanced and Emerging Market Economies as well as in Sri Lanka. After a rigorous review process, eight research papers, including two research papers from ERD, were selected to be presented at the conference. A special feature of the conference was the guest presentation delivered by Professor Lalith Samarakoon on “A Blueprint for Developing the Sri Lankan Financial Markets”. At IRC 2016, the Dr D S Wijesinghe Memorial Award for the Best Research Paper was awarded to Dr. Sujeetha Jegajeevan, an ERD officer. The Conference Proceedings of IRC 2015 were also released at this Conference.

The staff of ERD continued publishing their research in local and international publications. A Chapter titled Autoregressive conditional duration model with an extended distribution in the book Causal Inference in Econometrics (Springer International Publishing) was co-authored by Dr. Rasika Yatigammana and a Paper titled Determinants of commercial bank retail interest rate adjustments: evidence from a panel data model published in the Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money was co-authored by Dr. R.A. Anil Perera. ERD officials, including the Director of Economic Research and Additional Directors, served as paper presenters and discussants at various research fora. Officers of ERD served as resource persons at training programmes held in Sri Lanka and abroad, including the Programme on Applied Econometrics in Maldives and the Workshop on Compilation of Direct Investment in Thailand. Two officers of ERD also presented their research related to monetary policy and macroeconomic modelling at the inaugural Research Week organised by the SEACEN Centre, while officers contributed to joint research publications compiled by the SEACEN Centre and SAARCFINANCE.

Considering the importance of enhancing awareness of changes related to the Balance of Payments Manual – 6th edition (BPM6) among all stakeholders, during the year, ERD prepared a booklet outlining the changes resulting from BPM6 and explaining other key aspects of external sector statistics. The booklet is expected to be published in 2017. Further, Mr. Amila Wijayawardhana, an ERD officer, was selected as a BOP Expert by the IMF to conduct short term training in other central banks, based on his extensive experience in compilation of Sri Lanka’s External Sector Statistics.

An information series note on Exchange Rate and Economic Impact of Depreciation was also published during the year, in all three languages, to educate the general public about the fundamentals of exchange rate determination and the

economic implications of market based determination of exchange rate in Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, ERD actively engaged in the dissemination of knowledge in collaboration with the Communications Department (CMD), the Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) and Regional Offices of the Central Bank, for the use of university students, school teachers and students, and other government and private institutions. The public lectures on Annual Report 2015, in all three languages, were conducted by senior officers of ERD. A large number of educational events were conducted by officers of ERD in the areas of objectives and functions of the Central Bank, monetary policy, fiscal policy, external sector policies and recent economic developments. Also, experienced ERD officers with doctoral and masters level academic qualifications assisted internal postgraduate aspirants in developing research skills through the preparation of high-quality research papers and conducting short term courses on macroeconomics, microeconomics and mathematics to fulfill the requirements of the postgraduate scholarship scheme of Central Bank. At the request of the Training and Development Department, ERD officials evaluated 17 research proposals and 11 completed research papers in addition to research papers forwarded by the SEACEN Centre. These officers also evaluated 80 research proposals received for IRC 2016.

Several senior officers of ERD served as resource persons for the televised educational lecture series, Thakshilawa and Arivootru, conducted in the Sinhala and Tamil languages, respectively, organised by the CMD. Department staff also supported the CMD in the organisation of the inter-school quiz competition, Econ Icon held in both the Sinhala and Tamil languages. ERD also actively contributed to the organisation of the Inter-Bank Quiz Competition of the Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka.

7.6 Maintaining International Relations

ERD continued to serve as the focal point of contact for multilateral financial international organisations, such as the IMF, SEACEN, SEANZA, and SAARCFINANCE, on behalf of the Central Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka, while assisting in coordination efforts between the Government and the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other key international agencies.

Meanwhile, ERD coordinated two IMF staff missions with respect to the EFF Programme and a regular Article IV Consultation. ERD staff jointly worked with coordinators of other central bankes in the region on a number of SAARCFINANCE activities. The SAARCFINANCE Chairmanship was conferred upon the Governor of the Central Bank at the 31st SAARCFINANCE Group Meeting held in Peru in 2015, and accordingly, the Central Bank hosted the 23rd SAARCFINANCE Coordinators’

Meeting and the meeting of researchers under the SAARCFINANCE Collaborative Research Studies in April 2016 and also the 24th SAARCFINANCE Coordinators’ Meeting in September 2016, with ERD being the organising Department. These meetings were attended by SAARCFINANCE Coordinators, researchers and other senior officials from member country central banks and Ministries of Finance. ERD also facilitated the launch of SAARCFINANCE Database (SFDB) at the SAARCFINANCE Governors’ Symposium held in May 2016 at the Reserve Bank of India, and a Working Group on SFDB was later formed comprising three officers from ERD to study the feasibility and modalities of expanding the database to promote research on SAARC economies. Economic updates and macroeconomic statistics continued to be provided by ERD to several international organisations, such as the IMF, World Bank, and international sovereign rating agencies as well as international investors. ERD coordinated the preparation of presentations for various investor fora highlighting recent developments of the economy, trends and movements of key macroeconomic variables and on economic outlook.

8. EMPLOYEES’ PROVIDENT FUND

Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) was established under the Employees’ Provident Fund Act No.15 of 1958. All the administrative powers and functions of the Fund are vested with the Commissioner of Labour while all the powers, duties and responsibilities of the fund management are vested with the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as the custodian of the Fund in terms of the provisions of the Act. The Monetary Board has empowered the Employees’ Provident Fund Department of Central Bank to act as the operational arm in performing its functions.

(c) Pre-Retirement Refund Scheme

In terms of the provisions in Employees Provident Fund (Amendment) Act, No. 02 of 2012 and the subsequent procedures passed by the Parliament, payments under the 30 per cent EPF pre-retirement refund scheme, has been in operation since 01 July 2015. The scheme is in high demand by beneficiaries and Rs.41 billion has been refunded to over 70,000 beneficiaries by the end of 2016. During 2016, Rs. 33.7 billion has been released to 60,021 beneficiaries under this scheme.

(d) Image Scanning Project

Image Scanning Project (ISP) was initiated with the view of improving efficiency of services by establishing a near-paperless operating systems in the Department. The phase-I of the project which was commenced in year 2013 was successfully completed during the year 2015. In phase-I of the project the major documents: Master files, Form-D, Re-registration documents and Refund worksheets of the year 2013 were converted to electronic form. The completion of phase-I of the project helped to,

• Enhance the accessibility of documents,

• Decentralise amendments of EPF member details,

• Reduce the storage space and

• Save costs through human resources, stationery requirement, rent cost etc.

The Department commenced phase-II of the project to convert other important and frequently used documents to electronic form and expect it be completed by the end of year 2017. Real time scanning of documents is expected to commence by the second quarter of year 2017, to convert the paper documents received by the Department to electronic form at the point of reception.

(e) Public Awareness

Improving awareness on EPF operations is one of the main goals of the Department as a means of facilitating moving towards an integrated model. Accordingly, as a major mechanism for achieving the above goal, EPF Department conducted ten mobile services in different areas including Badulla, Mirissa, Kahawatta and Polonnaruwa in 2016. These awareness programs were conducted in collaboration with the Department of Labour and other government organisations such as the Department of Registration of Persons, Registrar General’s Department, Police Department and relevant District/Divisional Secretariats. Further EPF Department participated in 8 mobile services organised by the Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages covering Colombo District during the year.

At these mobile service programmes members and general public were offered, most of the services provided at the head office i.e. issuing of EPF balance statements, amendment of EPF member details and Accounts, re-registration of member details, promoting online member balance inquiry service and e-return service and providing advice on overall EPF procedures.

As in the previous years, a special awareness programme was conducted for relevant employers, managers and other administrative staff members of respective employers to identify the requirements of the mobile service with the view of enhancing the effectiveness of the mobile service. In addition, awareness activities were conducted in parallel to the mobile services targeting the employers, employees and other stakeholders on the services offered by the EPF using a mix of communication media such as posters, leaflets, video clips, and presentations.

(f) e-Return System for EPF Payments

Submission of EPF contributions by electronic means (e-Return), a total paperless solution, minimises the cost and delays while enhancing the efficiency of the process of updating member accounts which leads to providing a better service for the members. EPF has taken several measures to strengthen the e-Return system in order to absorb the target group, mainly the employers with 50 or more employees, during 2016. This complies with one of the requirements to achieve the target set under the Ease of Doing Business Index which reflects the convenience of carrying a business that attracts foreign investments to the country.

In early 2016, National Development Bank joined the existing group as a collecting agent and implemented a dedicated on-line payment system for EPF with the facility for data verification. This system validates the member details at the time of uploading the e-Return to the on-line payment system. It prevents manual intervention and avoids the time lags that occur in data processing and member accounts updating. Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC was also able to re-launch its EPF on-line payment system after amalgamating the data verification facility with the existing system, in mid-2016.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 76

Part II

In addition, actions were taken to make the employers aware of the e-Return systems by conducting awareness programmes and sending letters during the year. This has resulted in increasing the number of employers registered under the e-Return System to 6,955 by end 2016 from 6,093 as of end 2015 which covers about 76 per cent of the total 2.4 million active members.

(g) Re-registration of EPF Members

With the intention of providing an efficient service to EPF members, EPF Department and the Department of Labour launched a special project to re-register EPF members by names as appearing in their National Identity Card (NIC) and assign the NIC number as the Unique Identification (UID) Number, which enables both institutions to use a common Member Centric Database (MCD).

By end 2016, NIC details of approximately 1.8 million active EPF members (contributing members) had been collected. Out of these, 82 per cent of the member accounts (1.4 million accounts) were assigned UIDs, while the details of the remaining members are being processed after verification from their employers due to discrepancies between collected data and the existing data. Registering of new EPF members under NIC details on real time basis was commenced in November 2010. Accordingly, a monthly monitoring system has been put in place to capture the NIC details of all new members whose member contributions are received for the first time. Registration of existing members and registration of new members amounted to 69,326 and total number of registrations transferred to MCD was 76,386 during year 2016.

9. EXCHANGE CONTROL

In terms of Section 2 of the Exchange Control Act No. 24 of 1953 (ECA), the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as the agent of the Government, is responsible for carrying out the provisions of such Act. Section 2 of the Act further requires the Monetary Board to establish the Exchange Control Department (ECD) for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of ECA. Section 3 of ECA, empowers the Controller of Exchange (CE) as the head of ECD or on his behalf another designated officer to exercise or perform any powers, duties and functions authorised or required to be exercised or performed by the Central Bank by any provision of ECA, subject to the direction and control of the Governor. Section 3 also permits CE to delegate the granting of such permission to an Authorised Dealer (AD) by issue of Directions to such effect. Any commercial bank may be authorised by the Minister of Finance to act as an AD.

Accordingly, the main functions of ECD are policy formulation in respect of foreign exchange transactions to implement government policies and macro-economic objectives, issuance of Directions to ADs and Gazette Notifications to the general public to grant general permissions for

foreign exchange transactions, granting of approvals for specific foreign exchange transactions, issue of permits to money changing activities, monitoring of foreign exchange transactions and conducting investigations on violations of the provisions of ECA.

The change in the assets mix of the total assets between the foreign and local assets in 2016 is noted. The deficit money market liquidity position that prevailed in the latter part of 2016 has mainly resulted in the increase of local assets. Reduction in the foreign reserve due to balance of payment conditions in the country was reflected in the reduction in foreign assets. Similarly, on the liability side, the significance of the local liabilities increased as a result of the increase in the balances held by commercial banks and other financial institutions in line with the increase in the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) by 1.5 per cent in January 2016. Improvement in the net profits in 2016 was a result of market gains due to upward movement of gold market prices and higher interest income from Treasury bill holdings maintained for the purpose of open market operations. The appreciation of Rupee against GBP mainly led to the exchange loss on account of GBP denominated foreign assets, accounting for nearly 8 per cent of foreign reserves during mid of 2016 and the reduction in the rupee depreciation rate against US dollar in 2016. Financial results of the Central Bank are determined by monetary and financial policies of the bank in the public interest under the Monetary Law Act and the other statutes and therefore, operations of the Central Bank are not geared for commercial based financial results whereas cost efficiency is

During the year 2016, the Central Bank joined the Reserve Advisory and Management Programme (RAMP) of the World Bank with the objective of gaining enhanced technical expertise in Reserve Management. RAMP is conducted by World Bank Treasury which provides advisory services and training to state sector investment managers enabling efficient management of foreign currency reserves and other investment portfolios. The primary objective of RAMP is to help World Bank member institutions to upgrade their asset management capabilities, operational infrastructure and human resources capacity.

With the assistance of the World Bank under the RAMP initiative, the Central Bank manages its foreign reserves under a scientific approach which permits assets to be strategically allocated in accordance with the liabilities. This process known as Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) enables the Central Bank to determine the appropriate asset allocation at any point of time to achieve its long-term investment objectives. The SAA objectives are long-term and these objectives include meeting future payment obligations, preservation and enhancement of capital.

With rate hikes in the United States, investors sought to move their investments from Emerging Markets to Developed Markets for comparatively high return. However, the financial market volatility triggered by concerns of a potential spillover then president - Elect from the post Brexit market uncertainty and the proposed policy changes on international trade and fiscal sectors by the new US president elect, increased the safe haven demands which in turn lead to capital outflows from Asian economies. In this challenging global setting, IOD secured a realised return of US dollar 53 million during the year 2016 through foreign currency trading, money market investments and capital gains and coupon income derived from fixed income securities.

In 2015, the Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) signed currency swap agreements enabling Central Bank to draw US dollar 1,500 million. Under these agreements US dollar 700 million was available under special currency swap agreement in March 2016 for three months. US dollar 400 million out of the above swap agreement was available to Central Bank in April 2015 and was rolled over in the year 2016 four times under the financing facility for South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member country Central Banks. These facilities helped Central Bank to further strengthen its position in the financial market and bring greater stability to the exchange rate in line with macroeconomic fundamentals and movements of the currencies of major trading partners.

16.2 Analysis and Facilitation of Investment Activities

Under Investment Analysis and Facilitation activities the following main functions relating to Central Bank’s reserves management are conducted.

(a) Performance Measurement

IOD assesses performance of its reserve management activities on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis with special emphasis on total return, asset and currency distribution and presents to the FRMC and the Monetary Board together with an analysis of reserve position and its trend. Further, the returns generated through FIS investments are benchmarked against a passively managed portfolio weighted according to the Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) approved by the Monetary Board. In addition to income comparison, benchmarking helps to determine the effectiveness of active reserves management strategy by showing whether extra risk assumed by dealers is adequately compensated by subsequent extra returns.

(b) Administration of Treasury Management System (TMS)

IOD, apart from being the main user of the TMS, is responsible for the administration function including housekeeping activities related to TMS and ensures a proper coordination among other user Departments, the software vendor and the local partner. Further, IOD ensures that the TMS is fully connected with internal systems such as Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and General Ledger (GL) as well as external interfaces such as Bloomberg and Reuters to ensure efficient functioning of TMS related procedures and processes.

(c) Monitoring of Non- Financial Risks and Compliance

IOD prepares and monitors the non-financial risk profile relating to the reserves management activities and reports relevant risk treatments to the Non-Financial Risk Management Committee (NFRMC) on a quarterly basis.

(d) Annual Review of Existing Counterparties for Their Adherence/Compliance to Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT)

During 2016, IOD formulated a new Guideline-“Know Your Customer (KYC)/ Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rules for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for the foreign counterparties” to ensure compliance with rules and regulations and international best practices in relation to AML and CFT with regard to foreign exchange transactions by all counterparties of Central Bank.

16.3 Domestic Foreign Exchange Market Developments

The operations of the domestic foreign exchange market were streamlined during 2016 by the IOD through continuous monitoring of its activities, with the objective of curbing excess volatility in the exchange rate. The uncertainties provoked by Brexit and the high expectation of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve during the year, led the Dollar to appreciate. Consequently, the increased capital outflows and repatriation of foreign investments in Treasury securities exerted pressure on the

17. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE

The role of the Legal and Compliance Department (LCD) in achieving the core objectives of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has come to the forefront of strategic agendas in the recent past. LCD, in achieving its objectives i.e. safeguarding legal interests of the Central Bank and ensuring contemporariness of the legal and regulatory framework, played a significant role providing legal input to the Central Bank at the level of policy formulation on the matters of national importance. After the establishment of LCD in June 2015, it has been able to ensure the integrity of the Central Bank in all legal and procedural aspects in co-ordination with government departments, other regulatory authorities and other departments of the bank, in relation to the understanding of legal and implementation issues pertaining to financial system stability, financial market operations and payment systems and for the enforcement of laws applicable to the financial system of the country.

LCD plays a pivotal role in mitigating the legal and reputational risk of the Central Bank, whilst ensuring that the legal and regulatory framework administered by the Central Bank is on par with international standards and best practices.

Pursuant to its establishment, the department was able to handle almost all litigations and other legal issues of the Central Bank arising from time to time, effectively and efficiently. In this respect, continuous support of LCD has been extended to all other affiliated departments of the Central Bank to resolve legal issues confronted by such departments. All contracts, agreements and other key legal instruments executed by such departments were also drafted and/or subject to the review of LCD. Handling all notarial work, particularly on Central Bank Staff (Mortgage) Loan Scheme, was also a key function efficiently carried out by LCD.

LCD provided its observations, recommendations, and/or advice to the financial sector supervisory departments of the Central Bank, particularly when the need arises to take appropriate regulatory and enforcement action against non-compliance of regulated entities of such departments. Further, during this short period after its establishment, LCD has been assisting the Monetary Board of the Central Bank by providing advice, interpretations and recommendations sought by the Monetary Board from time to time, with a view to mitigate legal and other risks arising from its decisions.

Officers of LCD represented the Central Bank in various legal fora and tribunals such as superior courts, Bribery Commission etc., and liaised with the Attorney General’s Department in handling legal matters. The officers of the LCD attended as resource persons in several awareness programmes conducted to enhance the financial inclusiveness of the general public on illegal financial schemes, unauthorised finance business etc. In doing so, LCD has largely facilitated ensuring that the functions and activities of the Central Bank are carried out in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.

Main functions of MSD include conducting macroprudential surveillance, development of a database of key variables which could impact financial stability, preparation of annual Financial System Stability Review (FSSR) and contributing to statutory and other periodic reports. Accordingly, during the year, MSD continued to improve its macroprudential surveillance framework, conducted research on topics relating to the development and strengthening of financial system stability, and contributed to periodic statutory and other reports of the Central Bank, as summarised below.

(a) Macroprudential Surveillance

In line with its mandate, MSD continued to develop a series of financial soundness indicators for financial institutions, financial markets, corporate sector and the macroeconomy on a periodical basis, based on the data provided by relevant departments of the Central Bank and external institutions. These indicators are used to assess the health of aforementioned sub-sectors of the financial system and also to identify early signs of system-wide vulnerabilities, if any, being created. Further, the Department compiled several macroprudential indicators covering financial markets, licensed banks, non-bank financial institutions, corporate sector and the macroeconomy while continuing to improve its early warning indicator models to assess the behaviour of exchange rate, creditworthiness of the corporate sector and the movement of financial sector credit flows. Monthly financial sector risk assessment reports were submitted to the Monetary Policy Committee highlighting the trends and developments in the financial sector as revealed by aforementioned macroprudential surveillance.

(b) Research on Specific Financial Sector Topics

Research on four specific financial sector topics was conducted during 2016. These were focused on identification of restrictions, if any, for diversification of lending activities of non-bank financial institutions, asset securitisation, orderly resolution of weak financial institutions including dealing with impaired assets and organisational structure of financial sector departments of regional central banks.

(c) Contribution to Statutory and Other Reports of the Central Bank

MSD contributed and coordinated the preparation of the Chapter on ‘Financial Sector Developments and Stability’ in the Central Bank Annual Report 2015 and the Chapter on ‘Financial Sector Developments and Stability’ in the Recent Economic Developments 2016 published by the Central Bank. Further, the Department contributed to the Chapter on ‘Financial Sector Developments and Stability’ in the September 15 Report submitted to the Ministry of Finance in September 2016, by collating individual reports submitted by relevant departments of the Central Bank and external institutions. These reports provide comprehensive analyses on financial institutions, financial markets and financial infrastructure of the country with particular emphasis on performance, risks and risk management, resource availability and regulatory developments pertaining to each area together with an assessment of potential implications on the overall financial system stability of the country by each sector. The Department also contributed to similar activities of other departments of the Central Bank by way of compiling financial sector data, submitting regular reports and contributing to their publications.

20.1 Preparation of the Strategic Plan, Monitoring the Progress and Reporting to the Management

The Strategic Plan of the Central Bank for 2016 - 2018 under the theme of ‘Human Capital Development and Capacity Building’ was launched at the Work Commencement Ceremony held on 01 January 2016. Thereafter, copies of the Strategic Plan 2016 – 2018 publication were distributed to all employees to create awareness on the objectives and strategies of the departments as well as the mechanisms to be adopted to achieve the objectives together with Key Performance Indicators which are used to measure the progress of the implementation of the Strategic Plan. Performance review meetings were held at regular intervals with the departments to monitor the progress of the implementation of the Strategic Plan and Progress Reports were submitted to the management.

The preparation of the Strategic Plan of the Central Bank for 2017 - 2021 was commenced in the second half of 2016. The Strategic Planning Retreat, which is the management forum at which the new strategic plan is discussed, was held in November 2016 with the participation of the Governor, Monetary Board members, Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee members, Corporate Management of the Central Bank, Heads of Department and other relevant officials. The theme for the Strategic Plan 2017 - 2021 was set as “Breaking the Vicious Cycle”, highlighting the need for policy measures to overcome the current fiscal and debt dynamics of the country. The Strategic Plan of the Central Bank includes new initiatives, projects and activities expected to be undertaken by the Central Bank to break the vicious cycle and the 2017-2021 plan was made available to the staff.

20.2 Submission of Reports to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs

As per the requests received, the PRMD communicated the Strategic Plan and Performance Reports of Central Bank activities, which were obtained from the relevant Central Bank departments, to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, appropriately.

21. PUBLIC DEBT

Public Debt Department (PDD) is responsible for discharging statutory responsibilities of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as agent of the government for the management of public debt in terms of section 113 of the Monetary Law Act. Therefore, in order to meet these responsibilities, the PDD was established on 28 August 1950, at the inception of the Central Bank. The major functions include raising funds to meet the gross borrowing requirement of the government as per the Appropriation Act, meeting the government debt service payments on time, maintaining the LankaSecure system in order to facilitate smooth functioning of settlement of government securities and maintaining the Registry of government securities in the Central Depository System (CDS). In addition, PDD also engages in developing the debt market.

21.1 Raising of Funds to meet the Government Gross Borrowing Requirement as Specified in the Appropriation Act.

a) The issuance of Treasury bills (T-bills), Treasury bonds (T-bonds), Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) and International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) were the main instruments used for raising funds from domestic and foreign sources for financing the government’s gross borrowing requirement in 2016.

b) The following abridged analysis highlights the contribution and scope of each source of funds.

c) Total net foreign outflow of investments in T-bonds and T-bills amounted to US dollars 324.3 million which consisted of foreign inflow of US dollars 45.3 million for T-bills and an outflow of US dollars 369.6 million from T-bonds during the year.

d) Tightened monetary policy stance of Central Bank and policy rate hike in the United States, resulted in increased interest rates in both domestic and foreign markets in 2016. In this environment, with the issuance of short to medium term government securities in the domestic market as against issuances of long tenors in 2015 resulted in average time to maturity (ATM) of the outstanding domestic debt stock declining to 5.98 years by end 2016 from 6.28 years at end 2015. Further during 2016, all government securities issuances to the market were auction based.

21.2 Servicing of Government Debt

Domestic debt service payments of Rs. 1,042.72 billion and foreign debt service payments of Rs. 292.01 billion, totaling to Rs.1, 334.73 billion was made.

21.3 Facilitation of the Settlement of Government Securities

LankaSecure system is used for settlement of primary and secondary market transactions in government securities. The system consists of 33 Dealer Direct Participants (25 licensed commercial banks and 8 primary dealer companies) holding accounts on their behalf and on behalf of other investors who will be their customers and 3 direct participants (including EPF) who hold accounts on their own behalf only. PDD plays a main role in facilitating settlement by ensuring uninterrupted real-

time operation of LankaSecure. The total face value of holdings in scripless securities as at end December 2016 amounted to Rs.4,846.0 billion. This was composed of Rs.792.4 billion in T-bills and Rs.4, 053.6 billion in T-bonds.

21.4 Maintenance of the Registry in Government Securities

Facility for real-time updates in the Title Registry of government securities in the CDS, which is maintained at the PDD, has ensured smooth conduct of secondary market activities in government securities. PDD also introduced new account types to SSSS to comply with amendments to LankaSettle System Rules (Version 2.1) issued on 01 August 2013. Periodic statements to CDS account holders on their holdings, transactions and payments have been sent continuously throughout the year. PDD has sent 1,506 statements in electronic form and 23,161 semi-annual statements of holdings, 63,177 monthly statements of transactions and 40,065 payment statements by post to CDS account holders during 2016. In addition, CDS account holders are provided with the facility to view account details online. As at end December 2016, there were 92,065 registered CDS account holders.

21.5 System Reforms

The following system reforms were undertaken in the PDD within the year in order to optimise the service of the Department.

a) Regulation and supervision of Primary Dealers (PDs), as per the regulation issued under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance and the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance to ensure safety of investors of government securities and stability of the PD system was transferred to Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions.

b) From July 2016, PDD started conducting pre-bid meetings on forthcoming auctions, with all primary dealers, with the expectation that the availability of uniform market information would enhance transparency. In order to further enhance transparency, total accepted amount at an auction was capped at the aggregated offered amount for the T-bill and T-bond auctions during the latter part of the year.

c) Simultaneously in order to enhance governance, two treasury officials have been appointed as members to the T-bill, T-bond and SLDB Tender committee from August 2016.

d) PDD provided more information in the auction calendar by incorporating the auction date and tenor during the year. This will be published in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance which will enhance the predictability of the primary auction process and ensure the availability of information well in advance.

e) PDD has also been able to obtain the technical assistance of US Treasury advisor to improve the debt management strategies of PDD.

21.6 Debt Market Development

The objective of debt management is to ensure government financing comes at the lowest possible cost consistent with a prudent degree of risk. Therefore, PDD is striving to improve the competiveness in the government securities market by further enhancing transparency and thereby improving market efficiency. The following are the recent developments in the debt market.

a) Introduction of the Bloomberg trading platform for government securities has resulted in better price discovery, higher transparency and an increased confidence which is reflected by a significant increase in the volume of trading in the secondary market (Trade volume - Rs. 690.77 Billion, Number of transactions - 4,681). Further, the Bloomberg e-Trading Platform will be extended for repurchase transactions, and two-way quotes will be made mandatory.

b) The PDD is in the process of accessing Euroclearability of government securities in order to improve the settlement and clearance of the government securities to foreign investors. This will enable diversification of the foreign investor base, and improve the ease of accessing the government securities market for foreign investors.

c) Also Central Bank is in the process of establishing an electronic trading facility with Technical Assistance of US Treasury department and a Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP) for government securities along with the required regulatory framework.

d) As a way forward, the IT Department of the Central Bank has upgraded the web based auction system for T-bills and T-bonds. This upgraded version will be implemented once the independent audit is completed. In order to further improve transparency of the auction process, PDD prepared the auction rules that will be published in 2017. PDD is also currently reviewing the auction process with US Treasury assistance to enhance the price discovery process and transparency.

21.7 Coordinating Sovereign Rating Review Missions

PDD facilitated international rating agencies (Fitch Ratings Ltd., Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s) with their 2016 annual rating reviews in order to ensure the availability of international sovereign ratings for Sri Lanka and assessed these rating services for the country.

22. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Regional Development Department (RDD) with the objective of supporting achieving inclusive and balanced economic growth, and promoting financial inclusiveness in the country, continued to coordinate, facilitate and implement various refinance, interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes funded by the Central Bank, Government of Sri Lanka, Donor Agencies and Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) and delivered a range of credit supplementary services in 2016.

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 97

Accordingly, RDD provided affordable finance through concessionary loan and credit schemes for needy individuals and business ventures, in Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Micro, Small and Medium scale Enterprise (MSME) sectors enabling the beneficiaries of the loan schemes to meet their financial requirements. Further, RDD conducted a series of awareness building and skill development programmes throughout the year with a special focus on those who were outside the formal financial sector and used print, electronic and broadcast media also to raise public awareness of the various loan schemes implemented by the Department.

In 2016, from the policy viewpoint, a number of proposals were made to popularise the refinance schemes implemented by the Central Bank, aiming further development of the MSME sector. These measures, among others include, increasing the repayment period of loans granted under the Commercial Scale Diary Development Loan Scheme (CSDDLS), and revision of minimum loan limit under National Agribusiness Development Programme (NADeP).

22.1 Implementation of Loan and Credit Guarantee Schemes

During 2016, RDD continued to broaden financial outreach mainly through the operation of 13 loan and credit guarantee schemes (Table II-23). These schemes include the newly introduced Phase II of the Self-Employment Promotion Initiative Loan Scheme (SEPI–Phase II) funded by GOSL and two other loan schemes established under the NADeP which is funded by International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD).

During 2016, loans totaling Rs. 20,809.1 million were disbursed to 136,503 beneficiaries by PFIs through loan schemes implemented by RDD. Out of these disbursements, a majority of 63.3 per cent of loans were granted through the interest subsidy schemes while 36.7 per cent were disbursed through the refinance credit schemes. Of the total loans disbursed in 2016, 46.4 per cent loans were disbursed to the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry sector, while 40.6 per cent and 13.0 per cent were disbursed to the MSME sector and Microfinance sector, respectively.

Status of the loan schemes implemented by RDD in 2016 is given below.

22.2. Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Sector

Having identified the contribution made by the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry sector to the economic development of the country, RDD continued to serve this sector by providing concessionary loans through three loan and credit guarantee schemes in 2016. Loans amounting to Rs. 9,660.5 million granted to this sector accounted for 46.4 per cent of the total loan disbursements during 2016.

“Sarusara” or the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) which serves the small scale farmers of 33 short-term crop varieties by providing both interest subsidy and credit guarantee for loans granted by PFIs, is the principal scheme that provides loans for this sector.

• The disbursements of Rs. 8,009.2 million granted through the NCRCS accounted for 82.9 per cent of the total loans disbursed to the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry sector. It was an increase of Rs.871.2 million or 12.2 per cent over the amount disbursed in 2015. This increase was achieved amidst the adverse weather conditions that prevailed in the major cultivation areas. From the policy perspective, sugarcane was included as an eligible crop under the NCRCS with effect from September 2016, responding to requests received from the sugarcane farmers.

• Continuing the trend experienced in the past few years, Anuradhapura District received the highest amount of loan disbursements (17 per cent of loan disbursements) under the NCRCS, followed by Pollonnaruwa (12.9 per cent), and Ampara (10.3 per cent) districts. Among the provinces, beneficiaries (31,526 in number) in the North Central Province received the highest amount of loan disbursements (29.9 per cent) in 2016.

• The loan disbursement under the CSDDLS which operates as an interest subsidy scheme, increased marginally by 2.2 per cent during 2016. This scheme disbursed Rs. 1,633.5 million among 2,667 beneficiaries in 2016 which is 16.9 per cent of the total disbursements compared to the 14.7 per cent disbursed in 2015.

• In January 2016, considering the income generation pattern of the dairy farmers/entrepreneurs, the maximum grace period of loans granted under the CSDDLS was increased to 12 months from 06 months, depending on the requirement of the project. In addition, responding to requests made by farmers and considering the higher gestation period and the relatively longer period taken to transform into commercial scale by the small scale farmers who joined the CSDDLS, the repayment period of the CSDDLS was also increased to 6 years from 5 years, inclusive of the maximum grace period of 1 year, with effect from February 2017.

22.3. Micro, Small and Medium scale Enterprises (MSME) Sector

Identifying the contribution made by the MSMEs to national production, employment generation and innovation, RDD continued to serve this sector in 2016 distributing loans among the existing and potential entrepreneurs under concessionary rates, mainly to relieve them from the burden of the high cost of capital. In 2016, loans totaling Rs. 8,447.2 million were disbursed among 13,810 entrepreneurs who engaged in agriculture, manufacturing and service related activities in the MSME sector.

Loans to the MSME sector were disbursed through five credit schemes, namely, the Saubhagya Loan Scheme (SLS), Self-Employment Promotion Initiative Loan Scheme Phase II (SEPI-II), Smallholder Plantation Entrepreneurship Development Programme (SPEnDP), Working Capital Loan

Scheme for Tea Factories (WCLSTF) and the Dry Zone Livelihood Support and Partnership Programme - Revolving Fund (DZLiSPP-RF).

• The SLS which is considered the leading MSME refinance scheme provided a bulk of loans amounting to Rs. 4,767.1 million or 56.4 per cent of the total loans distributed in the sector serving 13,018 entrepreneurs.

• The WCLSTF which is a government funded interest subsidy scheme introduced in 2015 to assist the registered tea factories to meet their working capital requirements, disbursed Rs. 3,539.8 million among 115 entrepreneurs during 2016. Loans granted under this scheme accounted for 41.9 per cent of the loans disbursed to the entire sector.

• In April 2016, the SEPI-II was launched with the objective of providing financial assistance to trained youth for the establishment of their own self-employment projects. Under this scheme, loans amounting to Rs. 74.9 million were disbursed to youth, who had obtained vocational training qualifications from the special accredited technical institutions to commence small scale enterprises. The remaining SME loan schemes, namely, SPEnDP and DZLiSPP together disbursed Rs. 65.3 million among 505 borrowers during the year.

• RDD together with the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs (MNP & EA) designed a new loan scheme, named “SWASHAKTHI - Towards One Million Jobs” for the MSME Sector Development and Employment Generation. This scheme which is funded by GOSL provides financial support for both new entrants and existing entrepreneurs who engage in income generating activities in the Agriculture and Livestock, Industrial and Services sectors at village level. This new credit plus scheme is operated island-wide. The scheme identifies existing skills and talents of potential entrepreneurs and resources in the villages and provides them with necessary training and technical assistance together with marketing support to emerge as self-empowered micro entrepreneurs. Provision of a special grant to meet the initial expenses for the new entrepreneurs, in addition to the loans given at the rate of interest of 5.5 per cent per annum through PFIs, is the unique feature of this scheme.

22.4. Microfinance Sector

With a view to uplift the living standard of the underprivileged, the microfinance loan schemes of the RDD continued to serve low income earners enabling them to commence income generating activities. These schemes focused on reaching people who were excluded from the formal financial sector. Considering the role played by the financial management in the context of the development of the economy, these schemes paid special attention to increasing the financial literacy of this segment of the society as well. This sector was catered to mainly through the Poverty Alleviation

Micro-Finance Project-Revolving Fund (PAMP-RF), Poverty Alleviation Micro-Finance Project II - Revolving Fund (PAMP II-RF), the Small Farmers & Landless Credit Project-Revolving Fund (SFLCP - RF) and the NADeP. Through these loan schemes, in 2016, loans totaling Rs. 2,701.4 million were disbursed among 32,963 beneficiaries in the microfinance sector contributing 13.0 per cent of the total disbursements.

The PAMP II-RF, which accounted for 58 per cent of the total loan disbursements of the microfinance sector, served 19,268 beneficiaries during 2016. The comparative share in 2015 was 64.9 per cent. The disbursements made under the newly recommenced Microfinance Component of the NADeP (NADeP –Microfinance) loan scheme, which accounted for 27 percent of the loan disbursements in the microfinance sector, attributed to the decline in the relative share of PAMP II-RF in 2016. Despite this decline, the individual performance of the Project improved by registering an increase of 17.7 per cent in 2016.

• In January 2016, the NADeP–Microfinance Loan Scheme, funded by the IFAD, was re-commenced mainly to improve the livelihood of poor communities. The focus group of the NADeP–Microfinance primarily includes women, landless households and other marginalised groups. The programme provides micro credit for income generating activities, such as self-employment in agribusiness, agriculture, fisheries, livestock, trade and services, and small industries. In 2016, loans totaling Rs. 730.7 million were disbursed to 5,839 beneficiaries under the Scheme.

• In response to requests made by individuals to reduce the minimum loan amount under the NADeP–Microfinance loan scheme, the lower band of the loan limit was revised downward to Rs. 10,000 from Rs. 30,000 in April 2016 with the intention of expanding the outreach. Accordingly, beneficiaries are now eligible to obtain loans ranging from Rs. 10,000 - Rs. 300,000 under this scheme.

• In August 2016, the NADeP-Youth Empowerment and Employment Project (NADeP–Tharuna Diriya) loan scheme was launched, with a fund allocation of Rs. 225 million, targeting empowerment and engagement of youth in the development process. The primary objective of this loan scheme is to reach youth at the village level and help them improve their livelihood by providing credit facilities to start small businesses and other forms of self-employment projects. During August-December 2016, loans totaling Rs. 19.7 million were disbursed among 170 number of youth under the Scheme.

• The commencement of “Value Chain Development Capital Agriculture Loan Scheme” and “Value Chain Development Seasonal Agriculture Loan Scheme” under the “Out Grower Farmers Loan Scheme of NADeP was marked in October 2016, with the objective of increasing the production, productivity, quality and the value addition

of agricultural produce. The IFAD has allocated Rs. 623.2 million for these two loan schemes to achieve these objectives.

22.5. Other Initiatives

a. Conducting a Financial Inclusion Survey

With the intention of creating a pathway for improving the availability and accessibility of financial products and services, RDD conducted the first ever island-wide Financial Inclusion Survey in Sri Lanka, in 2016.

Based on the findings of this survey, and considering the contemporary financial inclusion strategies of peer countries, a comprehensive draft of the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion will be developed in 2017. RDD will also oversee National Policy Intervention Strategy – “Access to Finance” under the National Policy Framework for SME Sector Development.

b. Increasing Access to Finance for MSME Agribusinesses

In order to address the growing concerns of the general public and the government on organic agriculture, the foundation has been laid down to promote commercial scale organic agriculture and dairy entrepreneurs through the establishment of formal agribusiness societies and multi stakeholder enterprises. In this process, it is expected to provide financial and credit plus facilities while facilitating creating linkages between the farmers and entrepreneurs with market channels, and providing financial and technical support to graduate the identified farmers to the upper levels.

c. Initiating Discussions on Introducing a Loan Scheme for Solar Power Generation

With the intention of promoting solar rooftop power generation in the country, a series of discussions have been initiated to introduce a new loan scheme funded by Asian Development Bank with the collaboration of MNP&EA, Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, Sustainable Development Authority and other stakeholders. The main focus of this loan scheme is to support the government policy initiative to achieve 200KW electricity generation through solar power by year 2020.

d. Developing a Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) Scheme for Agriculture Modernisation Project

The Central Bank initiated actions to introduce the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme (PCG) under the proposed Agriculture sector Modernisation Project (AMP) funded by the World Bank, with the intention of addressing the emerging and changing needs of intermediary financial service providers. The PCG is an innovative risk sharing tool under the AMP which operates with the objectives of supporting agriculture productivity and efficiency, improving market access and enhancing value addition.

Further, the Matching Grant component of AMP that covers 50 per cent of the project cost is expected to further promote access to finance.

22.6. Skills Development and Capacity Building

Identifying the importance of financial literacy and awareness as dynamic parts of the journey towards comprehensive financial inclusion, the RDD in 2016 conducted 172 awareness programmes, mainly focusing on financial literacy, entrepreneurship development, skills development and Training of Trainer (TOT) etc. to educate beneficiaries and other stakeholders.

The financial literacy programmes were intended to create awareness of the drawbacks caused by financial exclusion. Further, these programmes highlighted the recompense of entering and linking with the formal financial sector. The focus groups were educated on good banking habits, financial discipline and new financial instruments and services as well. Moreover, RDD continued this educational process into more practical aspects by forming Self Help Groups to promote financial management and better financial habits.

Details of the programmes conducted by RDD are given in Table II-24.

23. REGIONAL OFFICE MANAGEMENT

Regional Offices Management Department (ROMD) was established in November 2016 replacing the five Departmental Level Regional Offices (DLROs) which were established in September 2015. The overall objective of the ROMD is to monitor and supervise the work of the Regional Offices of the Central Bank covering all provinces in the country.

In terms of the section 7 of the Monetary Law Act, a new Regional Office (RO) was established in Nuwara Eliya in January 2016 to promote regional development in the Nuwara Eliya and Badulla Districts. The Nuwara Eliya RO focused on credit delivery as well as providing services to the members of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) especially working in the plantation sector in the two districts. At present, the total number of Regional Offices stands at seven - Matara, Anuradhapura, Matale, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Nuwara Eliya.

23.1 Development related Activities

During 2016, the seven Regional Offices (ROs) engaged in developing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and improving the efficiency of credit delivery to promote the rural sector especially agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries and other identified specific projects in different sectors in the relevant region. The ROs supported the loan beneficiaries and prospective borrowers on ‘development credit’ through coordinating with commercial and development banks, other registered financial institutions and relevant government agencies to carry out their projects. During the year, 66 credit camps were conducted providing various facilities to 7,327entrepreneurs and established 3,121 credit links with prospective borrowers.

The necessary knowledge on financial literacy, entrepreneurship development and technological knowhow were provided to borrowers as well as to the members of the grass root level community based organisations through training programmes and workshops. In the areas of financial inclusion, application of new technology and skills development, 145 programmes were conducted covering approximately for 13,570 participants. ROs also conducted programmes on entrepreneurship development plus exposure visits to transfer technology in various fields. Accordingly, 55 entrepreneurship development programmes, 34 exposure visits/technology transfer programmes and 44 best practices programmes were conducted and 4,806, 1,292 and 1,971 participants benefitted through those programmes. Agriculture, fisheries and horticulture were some of the areas selected for technology transfer while a few special programmes were conducted in the fields of LED, hybrid and fibre technology. Further, measures were taken to create awareness and technology transfer on hybrid and organic farming by conducting 12 programmes among 597 individuals. Credit counselling services were also provided to the borrowers, who faced difficulties in repayments of their loan installments due to various reasons. Total beneficiaries of credit counselling amounted to 1,763 individuals. The ROs also assisted borrowers in their marketing efforts arranging marketing linkages, buyer-seller dialogues, trade fairs and exhibitions during the festive seasons.

Two specific meetings were conducted in Galle and Colombo respectively with the Provincial Governors, provincial government authorities and officials of the financial institutions in Southern and Western provinces. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss and identify financial and banking needs of the provinces, issues related to access to finance and financial inclusion in the provinces.

The seven ROs in 2016 facilitated expanding the core business activities of Central Bank in the regions through its various departments. The ROs conducted 107 programmes during

the year with respect to countrywide awareness on ‘clean note policy’, identification of forged notes, unauthorised financial institutions, prohibited schemes, financial intelligence and exchange control and educational programmes for students and teachers. A total of 9,347 individuals participated in the programmes. Out of 107 programmes, 39 were on clean note policy and forged note identification, 50 on unauthorised financial institutions and pyramid schemes and 08 educational seminars for students and teachers. In addition, a programme was conducted on EPF related issues for the benefit of employers and 95 senior plantation sector officials. Special attention was paid to provide services to EPF beneficiaries and 49,495 members availed themselves of these services. The ROs supported the Centre for Banking Studies of the Central Bank to conduct 09 training programmes and 671 staff members of the commercial banks and Financial Institutions outside the Western Province benefitted from these programmes.

24. RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk Management Department (RMD) was established on 09 February 2015 under Section 33 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, for the purpose of strengthening the risk management function within a sound risk governance structure in the Central Bank. In this context, the RMD plays the role of the second line of defense in a “three lines of defense” risk management framework that operates in the bank and is engaged in developing an independent and centralised risk management mechanism for the Central Bank. The RMD has undertaken the tasks assigned to the Department in a phase by phase manner and accordingly during the year, the RMD engaged in identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting financial risks pertaining to international reserves investment and investments by internal investments funds managed by the Finance Department (FD).

The highlights of key functions performed in 2016 were as follows.

1. Financial Risks pertaining to International Reserves Management

The types of financial risks in relation to international reserves investments focused by RMD were market risk and credit risk.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of possible losses due to price fluctuations in the market such as the interest rates and exchange rates. Market risk is captured through measures such as Modified Duration (MD), Interest Rate Sensitivity (IRS) and Value at Risk (VaR). MD measures the percentage change in price to change in yield and IRS is the degree of change in the value of the portfolio in response to the fluctuations in the market interest rates. VaR is used to measure the amount of potential loss in a portfolio of investments over a given time period at a given confidence level.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of default that may arise from the failure of the borrower or counterparty in meeting its obligations in accordance with agreed terms. The counterparty credit risk is assessed, monitored, reported and managed under Counterparty Credit Risk Management Guidelines (CCRMG) and ensured that all deals are carried out within the assigned limits. Credit risk of prospective counterparties is assessed based on their financial performances, credit ratings and their market exposures while existing counterparties are evaluated and monitored on a daily basis based on their credit ratings. Several counterparty exposure limits/product limits were revised during the year in line with credit rating changes by Fitch Ratings, Standard and Poor’s, and Moody’s Analytics. These revised limits are adjusted in the Treasury Management System (TMS) accordingly and communicated to the IOD enabling the dealers to enter in to transactions within the specified limits. In addition, as money market counterparties are more exposed to credit risk than counterparties dealing with fixed income securities, the RMD closely monitors the trends and volatility of Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads and Stock Prices of active money market counterparties on a daily basis and alerts the IOD of any signs of impending financial weakness (excessive volatility and signs of convergence/divergence), to ensure that the IOD transacts only with financially sound counterparties.

2. Technical Assistance from the World Bank (WB) under the Reserves Advisory and Management Programme (RAMP).

With the view of strengthening its risk management activities and reporting capacity, the RMD obtained technical assistance from the WB RAMP mission in the area of risk management pertaining to the investment of international reserves which would enhance the skills development of the Department.

3. Strategic Assets Allocation (SAA)

Continuing to discharge its functions, the RMD worked jointly with the IOD to construct a SAA for international reserves management by adopting an Assets and Liability Management approach in line with long term investment objectives to achieve an acceptable balance between risk and return of the investment portfolio. This mechanism would help to optimise international reserves management by segregating into tranches based on varying liquidity requirements over different time horizons. In this process, the RMD revisited the existing Foreign Reserves Management Guidelines (FRMG) and drafted two separate policy documents namely; Investment Policy Statement (IPS) and Investment Guidelines (IG) in line with international standards. In this context, SAA is one of the most important policies that is used for the development of both IPS and IG.

4. Global Market Developments

RMD closely monitored global market developments and global events, and evaluated their impact on the international reserves from a risk management perspective. In this regard, the RMD submitted risk escalation reports to the management in the areas of existing systems and controls relating to the payment and settlement system of the bank, potential risk of Brexit on international reserves management of the Central Bank, and potential contagion effects on other banks of the heightened credit risk of a major counterparty of the Central Bank.

5. Contribution to Foreign Reserves Management Committee (FRMC)

RMD continued to perform as an observer at the FRMC and made monthly presentations on the market and credit risks pertaining to the management of international reserves. In addition, the RMD evaluated investment proposals and analysed the impacts of global market developments on international reserves and presented them at the FRMC.

6. Daily Market Information

RMD continued to analyse market data and submit to the Governor on a daily basis. This information included market liquidity, behavior of short term interest rates, investment of international reserves, yield curve behaviour of government securities, and treasury fund requirements etc.

7. Risk Management pertaining to the Internal Investment Funds

The other important risk management task centralised at RMD was monitoring risks pertaining to the Internal Investment Fund managed by a special unit set up at the FD. Internal Investment Fund consists of rupee funds including Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Fund, Central Bank Pension Fund, Central Bank Provident Fund and other funds held by four departments of the Bank namely, Bank Supervision Department (BSD), FD, Staff Services Management Department (SSMD) and Regional Development Department (RDD). Managing these funds as well as monitoring risks pertaining to investment of these individual funds were carried out by respective departments previously. However, with the transfer of middle office functions relating to investment of the internal funds to the RMD, the RMD commenced monitoring and controlling risks pertaining to the investment of internal fund. Accordingly, the RMD engaged in providing risk related inputs to FD in formulating Investment Policy Statement (IPS), developing benchmarks for investment portfolio in line with objectives of the IPS, and monitoring the credit risk of counterparties based on the published credit ratings. The RMD analysed these investments from the risk management perspective and ensured compliance with the IPS approved by the Monetary Board on a monthly basis where the risk factors associated with investments were highlighted.

8. Contribution to Non-Financial Risk Management Committee (NFRMC)

RMD facilitated quarterly meetings of Non-Financial Risk Management Committee (NFRMC) chaired by the Governor. The NFRMC was set up to oversee non-financial risks of the departments which have relatively high exposure to non-financial risks. The Director of RMD continued to serve as the Secretary to the Committee by way of coordinating meetings and compiling risk profiles relating to non-financial risk of the member departments and presenting such information to the NFRMC.

25. SECRETARIAT

(c) Weapon Handling and Live Firing

Weapon handling and live firing were conducted for all security officers with the co-operation of the Sri Lanka Army during the last quarter of the year.

27. STAFF SERVICES MANAGEMENT

Staff Services Management Department (SSMD) continued to improve its welfare facilities extended to all beneficiaries in an efficient and effective manner throughout the year. These welfare facilities included provision of loans under the Staff Housing (Mortgage) Loan Scheme, Provident Fund Loan Scheme and Staff Benefit Scheme; reimbursement of expenses under the Employer Contributory Medical Benefit Scheme (MBS) and provision of Medical Centre and Restaurant facilities. The number of registered beneficiaries under MBS consisting of employees, pensioners, their registered dependents together with widows/widowers was approximately 10,000 as at end 2016.

During 2016, SSMD granted 2,188 loans which included Housing Loans, Provident Fund Loans, Vehicle Loans, Computer Loans and other loans under the Staff Benefit

Scheme. SSMD took measures to grant these loans within a stipulated time frame after receiving the application together with all relevant documents by the applicant. The loan monitoring system introduced by the Department enabled effective supervision of loan disbursement to employees. A system was developed with the assistance of the IT Department to transfer PF Loans to the applicants’ bank accounts through SLIPS.

The Central Bank restaurant continued to improve its service in providing food and tea service for Central Bank staff. The improved quality of the food served and the tea service provided by the restaurant was also highly endorsed by the Central Bank staff in a survey conducted by SSMD. Further, measures were taken to improve the environment of the restaurants and restaurant facilities during 2016.

SSMD continued to reimburse medical expenses incurred by all registered beneficiaries under MBS. The total amount of reimbursement of medical expenditure increased by thirty four per cent (34 per cent) in 2016 compared to the previous year. With the approval of the Monetary Board, the reimbursement limits of medical expenditure were increased under MBS with effect from 01.01.2016. The medical facilities at the Medical Centre were made available to the Central Bank employees during working hours by outsourcing such services to a reputed private hospital. Further, medical tests and laboratory service facilities were also provided at the Medical Centre at a reasonable charge. During the year, SSMD conducted three awareness programmes to enhance the knowledge of the Central Bank staff on important health issues. A Health Camp for the employees was successfully conducted in June 2016.

28. STATISTICS

Statistics Department (STD) continued to contribute towards the achievement of key objectives of the Central Bank, during 2016 by effectively performing its functions in the economic and Price Stability Cluster. Key activities of the department included estimating and forecasting short term key macroeconomic variables using model and non-model based techniques; collaborating with other departments to produce macroeconomic models using advanced techniques such as Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS), Bayesian VAR (BVAR) and Factor Augmented VAR (FAVAR) etc. for policy purposes; compiling price and wage indices; the Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI) and the Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP); collecting and processing data from primary sources, the Country-Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS) in particular, and other secondary sources; conducting surveys and compiling economically important forward looking indicators using the information thus collected to facilitate the monetary policy decision making process; timely dissemination of statistics and information through publications and press releases; maintaining a data repository, initially for internal use, which was subsequently

released to the general public in the form of a data library; and contributing towards improving Sri Lanka’s position in key global rankings. In addition, STD engaged in providing resources for capacity building initiatives for local and international organisations, during the year.

28.1 Forecasting Key Macroeconomic Variables

To facilitate the core objective of maintaining economic and price stability, STD provided short term forecasts of consumer price inflation and economic growth. These forecasts were submitted to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Monetary Board for monetary policy formulation purposes. Moreover, the inflation forecasts are updated frequently in line with realised and perceived changes in variables which impact inflation based on the movements of observed consumer prices, along with the developments in input and output prices as reflected through findings of surveys conducted by the Department.

A range of inflation forecasting methods were used, depending on the time frame of the forecast. Short term inflation forecasts are mainly based on recent price trends, and expected short term price movements associated with market developments. Medium to long term forecasts are based on econometric techniques while continuously exploring new variables that reflect both supply and demand side impact on inflation. In this regard, STD contributed to the construction of several forecasting models for the FPAS of Central Bank jointly with ERD.

The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) rebased the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) from 2006/07 to 2013 during the year in order to accommodate the changing expenditure patterns and to incorporate changes of goods and services available in the market. DCS released the rebased CCPI (Base 2013=100) in January 2017. STD re-designed the forecasting methods to suit the new CCPI. Meanwhile, STD continues to monitor the price developments in both NCPI and CCPI for policy making purposes.

Growth forecasts were prepared on a quarterly basis using primary and secondary data related to each sub activity of the economy. Leading economic indicators, survey findings and other information related to sub activities of the economy were used in compiling indicator based forecasts, while model based forecasts employed statistical techniques to improve the accuracy of forecasts. The indicator based forecasting method was further streamlined under the new classification based on the rebasing of GDP to year 2010. Accordingly, new indicators prepared based on survey findings of Central Bank and additional information gathered from outside organisations were incorporated to the process.

In addition to the in-house forecasting framework, STD was involved in the development of the FPAS of Central Bank, jointly with ERD under the technical assistance of IMF. A New Keynesian open economy model for medium term

forecasts of macroeconomic variables including GDP and Inflation was developed under this framework, which would be used for monetary policy analysis, after the conclusion of the model evaluation stage. In addition, FAVAR and BVAR models were developed to generate near term forecasts of inflation and GDP.

28.2 Compiling Price and Wage Indices

STD continued constructing Land Price Index (LPI) on a semi-annual basis using valuation data obtained from the Valuation Department for 51 sub-divisions in Colombo, Dehiwala, Homagama, Kaduwela and Kesbewa Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions. Three separate indices were compiled covering residential, commercial and industrial properties, while arriving at the overall LPI through simple average. In addition, STD has taken several initiatives to improve the coverage of real estate property indices by improving the existing indices both geographically and methodologically, and also by introducing new indices to capture developments in the residential property market, especially the condominium segment. Accordingly, a price index has been constructed during 2016 to monitor price movements in the condominium property market covering Colombo district, for management information.

STD compiles wage rate indices to assess the movements of salaries and wages in the economy. STD compiles nominal and real wage rate indices for public sector employees. Real wage rate indices for formal private sector is based on the nominal wage rate indices of employees in the Wages Boards Trades compiled by the Labour Department. Informal private sector wage movements were analysed in terms of the informal private sector wage rate index compiled based on information collected through the CWDCS. STD initiated compiling a new index that represents wage trends of formal private sector employees.

28.3 Compiling the Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI)

STD compiled SLPI, which is a composite indicator that measures and compares the level of prosperity of the country across its provinces for the year 2015. It comprises three sub-indices, Economy and Business Climate, Wellbeing of the People and Socio-Economic Infrastructure, which are measured using 42 representative variables reflecting the economic and social progression of provinces. A new methodology which closely follows the Legatum Prosperity Index’s methodology, i.e. standardising the data to bring all the variables into proportion with one another, instead of normalising the data, has been adopted in the compilation of SLPI since 2014. The Department is continuously exploring for improvements in variables and methodology with the intention of enhancing the representativeness of the index in explaining the overall prosperity of the country. Accordingly, during 2016 a new variable to measure the formal sector employed population as a percentage of total employed, is included in the Economy and Business Climate segment strengthening the quality of the index.

28.4 Computing the Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP)

PGDP in nominal terms has been computed and published by STD for the year 2015 as well, by disaggregating the National Accounts estimates of the DCS. In estimating PGDP, the value of each line item in GDP is apportioned using relevant indicators at provincial level. The figures for 2015 and revised estimates for the year 2014 were published in August 2016. STD is constantly exploring suitable indicators at provincial level to apportion the national figures, to improve the reliability of the estimates. In line with this, work in progress (WIP) of animal production activity was added while total civil aviation and total cargo handled in the transportation of goods and passengers was expanded by including warehousing, strengthening the indicators for the Agriculture and Services sectors, respectively. Most applicable variables were used in construction activities under the industry sector for the relevant year during 2016.

28.5 Conducting Statistical Surveys

Business Outlook Survey (BOS) continued during 2016 to capture short term market developments and to monitor the current economic situation. The BOS serves as an early warning indicator of future economic developments. The target population of this survey was large scale enterprises covering three major activities (Agriculture, Industry and Services) of the economy. Four rounds of the survey were carried out continuously during the year for each quarter and based on the results of the survey, Business Sentiment Indices (BSI) namely; Business Condition, Profitability, Skilled Labour Availability, Sales, Demand and Capacity Utilisation were computed. The results were presented to MPC and were published quarterly in aggregate form for the information of the general public in the Central Bank website.

Credit Conditions Survey, which was designed to capture demand and supply side developments in the credit market was also continued during the year 2016. This consists of a credit demand survey to capture the demand side developments and a credit supply survey to capture the supply side developments of the credit market. The credit supply survey covers all licensed commercial banks and licensed specialised banks of the country. With regard to the credit demand survey, the target population was Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) of the economy. The survey was conducted in the Western province and in provinces in which Central Bank has regional presence. The results of Credit Conditions Survey were reported to the management on a semi-annual basis for policy related decision making.

Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing and services activities was compiled on a monthly basis to provide purchasing professionals, business decision-makers and economic analysts with an additional and timely set of data to help better understand industry conditions,

and to use such data as early indicators of manufacturing and service sector activities. With regard to the PMI survey for manufacturing activities, purchasing managers of the manufacturing industries of the economy predominantly concentrated in the Western province is the target population. The survey was carried out during the last week of each month targeting responses from 100 institutions. The PMI-Manufacturing with the sub-indices of New Orders, Production, Employment, Suppliers’ Delivery Time and Stock of Purchases, and PMI-Services with sub-indices of New Businesses, Business Activity, Employment, Backlogs of Work and Expectations for Activity were computed assessing the Month on Month change and reported to the MPC and senior management for policy related decision making purposes. A new variable “Prices Charged” was included in the PMI-Manufacturing survey from July 2016 to grasp the producer level price developments in the manufacturing segment. PMI indices were published in the Central Bank website for the information of the general public from June 2016 on a monthly basis.

The Inflation Expectations Survey has been conducted by the Department on a monthly basis since its introduction in 2006. Current survey includes two categories of respondents; Corporate Sector and the Household Sector. STD initiated a re-sampling process of the respondent base during 2016. Respondents provide both quantitative and qualitative information on current inflation perceptions and inflation expectations for a period of 12 months ahead. The results of the survey on monthly basis were reported to the MPC and for policy related decision making purposes.

The Public Sector Employment Survey (PSES) was conducted covering all public sector institutions to ascertain developments in public sector employment and was conducted on a semi-annual basis. Moreover, information collected on the labour force and the labour market were also analysed with respect to employment, unemployment, foreign employment, labour relations, labour market reforms and labour productivity in the country. Collaborative data sharing was carried out with national and international agencies in order to assist policy formulation on related topics.

STD, in collaboration with the other departments of the Central Bank and a few other external agencies contributed to the completion of the 2017 World Bank Global Financial Inclusion and Consumer Protection (FICP) Survey.

STD initiated a survey during the year to develop a Private Health Services Index (PHSI) to monitor developments in private health activities. A census was commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 to enumerate the number of patients treated by private hospitals and medical centres in Sri Lanka as a part of the exercise to identify a suitable sample to represent the private health activities in the country. Initially, the survey is planned to be conducted on a quarterly basis collecting monthly information on the number of out-patients as well as admissions in private hospitals and medical centres for the compilation of the index.

28.6 Administering the Country-Wide Data Collection System

The Country-Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS), which commenced in 1978, was continued during the year 2016 with regular collection of information on retail prices of consumer goods, producer prices of agricultural and fisheries commodities, daily wages of the informal private sector and approximations on future production levels of agriculture and fisheries commodities on a weekly, monthly and quarterly basis. Data were collected through government school teachers, who serve as statistical investigators in 106 data collection centres island-wide. Further, the system utilises services of 7 non-teacher data investigators to report data on wholesale and retail prices from Pettah Market, Maradagahamula Rice Market, Dambulla and Narahenpita Special Economic Centers, and Negombo and Peliyagoda Fish Markets on a daily and weekly basis. In order to strengthen the management information system, the department collects wholesale and retail prices of a range of food commodities from selected markets on a daily basis as well.

Data collected under the system are extensively used for analysing seasonal variations and regional differences in prices and wages; compilation of price indices, PGDP and SLPI; forecasting price movements; evaluation of the impact of policy changes on prices; estimation of national expenditure and income; and dissemination of price and wage data to the general public.

In order to maintain the accuracy and timeliness of the data, the Department carried out regular on-site and off-site supervision of the data reported by the statistical investigators. Accuracy was further verified using the price data collected directly from selected markets in the Colombo District by the officers of the Department.

In line with the usual practice, five CWDCS regional seminars were conducted in Colombo, Matara, Anuradhapura, Kandy and Jaffna during the year 2016 to share experience, to obtain feedback on differences in price developments across identified regions, and to discuss operational issues of the programme. The seminars were also aimed at enhancing the capacity of the statistical investigators.

As in previous years, the data collection process was improved during the year by introducing updated formats for data collection with the view of accommodating recent market developments and economic activities. The data format used for the Early Warning System (EWS) was also revised during the year to make it more informative and user-friendly. Further, with the view of expediting data collection and compilation, electronic data reporting system by Teacher Investigators (TIs) was encouraged and about one fourth of the TIs were able to afford using the e-reporting data system during the year 2016. Moreover, STD has already taken initial steps to revamp the existing CWDCS using technology, aiming at rapid data collection and efficient processing.

28.7 Improving Sri Lanka’s Position in Global Rankings

“Ease of Doing Business” Ranking

As in the past few years, STD continued its efforts in contributing towards the improvement of the “Ease of Doing Business” ranking of Sri Lanka. Since 2016, a new working arrangement was set-up under the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, with the technical assistance of the World Bank (WB), for implementing reforms in line with the overall objective of improving the investment climate. Accordingly, during 2016, STD participated in continuing constant dialogue with the relevant government institutions to keep track of the progress of the ongoing reforms; organising contributors’ meetings to make them aware of the most recent developments; facilitating WB missions to discuss with public and private officials working on areas related to the ranking; coordinating Sri Lankan participation at international seminars on improving country position, and most importantly disseminating information in a timely manner to the WB Group on the reforms implemented focusing on variables tracked under this ranking.

Other Global Rankings

Global Indices namely Worldwide Governance Indicators, The Global Competitiveness Index, Index of Economic Freedom, Human Development Index, Economic Freedom of the World Index, Corruption Perceptions Index, Enabling Trade Index and Country Risk Classification of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were monitored continuously and reports on country position and strategies to improve rankings were submitted to the management and other higher authorities when required. Macroeconomic information and data was provided to the compilers of the above mentioned indices on a weekly and a monthly basis.

28.8 Dissemination of Statistics

STD annually disseminates a wide range of socio-economic data of current interest to policy makers, researchers, academics, professionals, students and the general public. During the year, the Department released “Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 2016 – Volume XXXVIII” in August, and “Sri Lanka Socio Economic Data Folder 2016 – Volume XXXIX” in September in all three languages and in electronic format. In addition, STD continued publishing the Monthly and Weekly Economic Indicators promptly, while preparing Daily Price Reports of selected consumer items to strengthen the analysis of price movements of essential food items in key markets that have significant impact on the country’s general price level which were made available for the general public via the Central Bank website in 2016. STD contributed to two chapters of the Central Bank Annual Report and Recent Economic Developments, and also to the Monthly Bulletin of Central Bank.

Further, STD has initiated and coordinated developing an electronic database for the benefit of various data users. The system was launched internally during 2016 with technical assistance from Information Technology Department. The e-research database consists of time series data on a variety of topics spanning across Real, Monetary, Fiscal, External, and Financial sectors from nine departments. It facilitates numerous data requirements by enabling the creation of own queries, generating tables, downloading and saving them for future reference. Moreover, steps were taken to launch a further improved version of this database to the general public through the Central Bank website during the early part of 2017.

29. SUPERVISION OF MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS

Department of Supervision of Microfinance Institutions (DSMI) was established to regulate and supervise the microfinance business as stipulated in the Microfinance Act, No. 6 of 2016 (Microfinance Act). The responsibilities of DSMI include, processing applications for licences to carry on microfinance business, supervising Licensed Microfinance Companies (LMFCs) through periodic statutory examinations and off-site surveillance, submitting regular reports to the Monetary Board on the progress and issues relating to LMFCs, issuing of rules and directions to LMFCs, granting of regulatory approvals to LMFCs, cancelling of licences and winding up of LMFCs, setting of principles, standards and guidelines to Registrar of Voluntary Social Service Organisations (RVSSO) on registration and supervision of Microfinance Non-Governmental Organisations (MNGOs), conducting microfinance sector research, and conducting training and public awareness programmes,. The key functions and other activities of DSMI during 2016 are given below.

I. Issuance of Rules and Directions to LMFCs

The Monetary Board issued 2 Rules, namely licensing criteria and licence fee and 8 Directions on, minimum core capital, statutory reserve, deposits, maintenance of minimum liquid assets, assessment of shareholders, assessment of fitness and propriety of directors and chief executive officer/general manager, regulation of accommodations, and reporting requirements, with effect from 27 October 2016.

II. Regular Meetings with RVSSO and Others Stakeholders

The Department conducted regular meetings with RVSSO, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the Lanka Microfinance Practitioners’ Association (LMPA), in order to set principles, standards and guidelines to RVSSO, on the supervision of MNGOs.

III. Survey on Microfinance Sector

In order to identify regulatory requirements and formulate an effective and efficient regulatory system, a survey was conducted on microfinance institutions, with the assistance of the LMPA.

IV. Study Visits

Study visits were conducted to several microfinance institutions, in order to become familiar with the current practices, systems and processes adopted by the microfinance industry. Further, international experience on regulating the microfinance sector was also studied with special emphasis on the Asian region, in order to formulate regulations for LMFCs and MNGOs.
