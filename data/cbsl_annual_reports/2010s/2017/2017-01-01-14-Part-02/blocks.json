The SDRs value as a reserve asset derives from the commitments of members to hold and accept SDRs, and to honor various obligations connected with the operation of the SDR system. The IMF ensures that the SDRs claim on freely usable currencies is being honored in two ways: by designating IMF members with a strong external position to purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions, and through the arrangement of voluntary exchanges between participating members in a managed market. The amount shown above represents the total holding of the Bank as at the respective reporting dates.",

SDRs are allocated to member countries in proportion to their IMF quotas. SDR allocations can only be made to countries that participate in the IMF\u2019s SDR Department (an accounting unit within the IMF). The IMF created SDRs to supplement existing official reserve assets such as gold holdings, foreign exchange and reserve positions in the IMF. Under certain conditions, which are set in the Articles of Agreement signed on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka by the Bank, the IMF may allocate SDRs to members in proportion to their IMF quotas. An allocation of SDRs by the IMF provides each member with a costless asset on which interest is neither earned nor paid. The Articles of Agreement also allow for cancellations of SDRs, but to date, this provision has not been used. Increases in Allocation of SDR represents increases in Holding of SDR as described in Note 7. Members of IMF are obligated to pay to the IMF an amount equal to its net cumulative allocation and any other amounts that may be due and payable because of its participation in the Special Drawing Rights Department at the point of termination or liquidation of IMF\u2019s SDR Department.",

The Committee is chaired by the Governor and selected key departments that have relatively high exposure to risk, are members of the committee. The Director of Internal Audit Department acts as an observer. The principle objective of NFRMC is to assist the Monetary Board in its responsibility to identify, assess (in terms of impact and likelihood) and monitor non-financial risk of the Bank, in order to safeguard Bank\u2019s reputation and mitigate any losses and damages. The Committee also reviews and assesses the quality, integrity and effectiveness of the risk management process and internal control procedures.",

The Bank uses historical simulation method to calculate VaR number for 10 days period at 99% confidence interval. The historical method for estimating VaR is sometimes referred to as the historical simulation method. As an example to calculate the 5% daily VaR using the historical method is to accumulate a number of past daily returns, rank the returns from highest to lowest, and identify the lowest 5% of returns.

    "text": "The local Treasury bills portfolio is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position of the Bank at amortized cost as it represents loans provided to the Government of Sri Lanka. This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Treasury bills with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Treasury bills to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Treasury bills in the Bank\u2019s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank\u2019s actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Treasury bill portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank\u2019s Treasury bill portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the bank\u2019s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets.",

Hence, the excess rupee liquidity in the domestic money market declined gradually and there was a deficit in market liquidity by end March 2016. The deficit in market liquidity continued until the latter part of December. During this period, the Central Bank conducted reverse repo auctions on most of the days. Money market liquidity turned positive again during the latter part of December, mainly due to foreign exchange related transactions of the Central Bank and foreign loan disbursements, and by end December 2016, excess market liquidity amounted to Rs. 39.2 billion compared to an excess of Rs. 81.7 billion at end December 2015.",

The AWCMR which was at 6.40 per cent at end 2015 showed an upward trend at the beginning of 2016. It increased rapidly towards the upper bound of the policy rate corridor following the initial policy rate adjustment of the year. With further declines in market liquidity, from end March the AWCMR breached the upper bound of the corridor, as a result of the distortion created by the tax applicable to interest income from secondary market transactions in government securities, and hovered around 8.20 per cent until the next policy interest rate change in July. Since a significantly large market interest rate adjustment was realised with the previous policy rate revision, a relatively lower adjustment in the AWCMR was seen within the corridor following the policy rate change in July. At end 2016, the AWCMR was 8.42 per cent. The average daily call market volume was Rs. 14.5 billion in 2016 and fluctuated in a range of Rs. 2.99 billion and Rs. 25.05 billion.

Comprehensive analyses were compiled based on this ongoing surveillance, macroeconomic statistics and macroeconometric projections, and submitted with timely policy recommendations to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), enabling the MPC to provide forward looking guidance to the Monetary Board on the direction of monetary policy that is conducive to the creation of economic growth in a low inflation environment. As key inputs for this decision making process, ERD continued to provide projections of the path of headline and core inflation, estimations of potential output and output gap measures and the movements of broad money and credit aggregates. The Monetary Board was also provided with ongoing appraisals of potential risks to the achievement of the projected path of key macroeconomic variables stemming from both domestic and international volatilities, and appropriate policy measures were proposed. Subsequent to the announcement in the Annual Report 2015 of the Central Bank\u2019s pursuit of an enhanced monetary policy framework, ERD continued to engage in the formal appraisal of key economic stakeholders on the proposed transition plan towards a Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework over the medium term. As an essential element of this transition, ERD jointly worked with a technical team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during 2016 to build a Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS). Accordingly, three Technical Assistance missions were coordinated by ERD and attended by selected staff members in the Economic Policy Advisory cluster of the Central Bank. The focus of these missions was on the strengthening of technical capabilities of the Central Bank staff on macroeconomic model building and forecasting. In order to continue phased implementation of this system, an inter-departmental Modelling and Forecasting Unit (MFU) was formed in May 2016 with ERD staff holding several key responsibilities. As a cornerstone in the implementation of FPAS, MFU jointly prepared medium-term projections with the IMF team, and presented its findings and policy recommendations at a special MPC meeting. In recognition of the need for institutional commitment for the continuation of these efforts, the Modelling and Forecasting Division (MFD) was permanently established in ERD. The MFD is entrusted with the responsibilities of further developing and implementing the FPAS, preparing a Financial Programme for Sri Lanka, and conducting model based policy analysis and research along with other Divisions in ERD. During the year, ERD also commenced upgrading the compilation of monetary statistics in line with the IMF\u2019s latest Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Accordingly, ERD coordinated a Technical Assistance mission from the IMF in July 2016",

Reduction in the foreign reserve due to balance of payment conditions in the country was reflected in the reduction in foreign assets. Similarly, on the liability side, the significance of the local liabilities increased as a result of the increase in the balances held by commercial banks and other financial institutions in line with the increase in the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) by 1.5 per cent in January 2016. Improvement in the net profits in 2016 was a result of market gains due to upward movement of gold market prices and higher interest income from Treasury bill holdings maintained for the purpose of open market operations. The appreciation of Rupee against GBP mainly led to the exchange loss on account of GBP denominated foreign assets, accounting for nearly 8 per cent of foreign reserves during mid of 2016 and the reduction in the rupee depreciation rate against US dollar in 2016. Financial results of the Central Bank are determined by monetary and financial policies of the bank in the public interest under the Monetary Law Act and the other statutes and therefore, operations of the Central Bank are not geared for commercial based financial results whereas cost efficiency is",

The counterparty credit risk is assessed, monitored, reported and managed under Counterparty Credit Risk Management Guidelines (CCRMG) and ensured that all deals are carried out within the assigned limits. Credit risk of prospective counterparties is assessed based on their financial performances, credit ratings and their market exposures while existing counterparties are evaluated and monitored on a daily basis based on their credit ratings. Several counterparty exposure limits/product limits were revised during the year in line with credit rating changes by Fitch Ratings, Standard and Poor\u2019s, and Moody\u2019s Analytics. These revised limits are adjusted in the Treasury Management System (TMS) accordingly and communicated to the IOD enabling the dealers to enter in to transactions within the specified limits. In addition, as money market counterparties are more exposed to credit risk than counterparties dealing with fixed income securities, the RMD closely monitors the trends and volatility of Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads and Stock Prices of active money market counterparties on a daily basis and alerts the IOD of any signs of impending financial weakness (excessive volatility and signs of convergence/divergence), to ensure that the IOD transacts only with financially sound counterparties.",

In this process, the RMD revisited the existing Foreign Reserves Management Guidelines (FRMG) and drafted two separate policy documents namely; Investment Policy Statement (IPS) and Investment Guidelines (IG) in line with international standards. In this context, SAA is one of the most important policies that is used for the development of both IPS and IG.",

Managing these funds as well as monitoring risks pertaining to investment of these individual funds were carried out by respective departments previously. However, with the transfer of middle office functions relating to investment of the internal funds to the RMD, the RMD commenced monitoring and controlling risks pertaining to the investment of internal fund. Accordingly, the RMD engaged in providing risk related inputs to FD in formulating Investment Policy Statement (IPS), developing benchmarks for investment portfolio in line with objectives of the IPS, and monitoring the credit risk of counterparties based on the published credit ratings. The RMD analysed these investments from the risk management perspective and ensured compliance with the IPS approved by the Monetary Board on a monthly basis where the risk factors associated with investments were highlighted.",

Since 2016, a new working arrangement was set-up under the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, with the technical assistance of the World Bank (WB), for implementing reforms in line with the overall objective of improving the investment climate. Accordingly, during 2016, STD participated in continuing constant dialogue with the relevant government institutions to keep track of the progress of the ongoing reforms; organising contributors\u2019 meetings to make them aware of the most recent developments; facilitating WB missions to discuss with public and private officials working on areas related to the ranking; coordinating Sri Lankan participation at international seminars on improving country position, and most importantly disseminating information in a timely manner to the WB Group on the reforms implemented focusing on variables tracked under this ranking.",
