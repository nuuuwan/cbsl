    "text": "The global financial crisis, which emerged during the period of 2008-2012, compelled the regulators to introduce new regulations while strengthening the existing regulations for enhancing the safety and soundness of the financial institutions. The excessive risk taken through on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures by banks with securitisations of sub-prime mortgages led to heavy losses, thereby eroding banks\u2019 capital. Many reputed financial institutions around the globe with large amounts of assets, which were considered by the market as Too-Big-To-Fail, were severely affected. Accordingly, certain large institutions were rescued by implementing various measures, including taking over or merging with other financial institutions, nationalisation and bailing-out by the respective governments, while some financial institutions were declared insolvent or liquidated. With these consequences, regulators around the globe emphasised the need to enhance quality and quantity of capital of banks. Accordingly, regulators have focused on increasing minimum capital requirements, which were required to be met with capital components with a higher loss absorbing capacity such as common shares, share premium and retained earnings.",

Without access to formal financial services, the unserved and underserved segments of society will be excluded from economic growth and its benefits and would be lured by the informal financial sector. The low income customers and microenterprises are generally neglected by formal financial institutions due to their low income and inability to provide collateral and thereby, lack of access to basic financial services. Nevertheless, microfinance functions as a tool of financial inclusion by providing various financial services including; loans, savings, insurance, remittances and other services, such as training and consultation, targeting these low income customers and microenterprises. By providing access to financial services, microfinance is expected to expand and improve income generation activities and capacity of low income persons and microenterprises and thereby ensure benefits for the society as a whole, through effective allocation of economic resources.",

Furthermore, poor corporate governance, and weak systems and controls in these institutions could result in weak credit disbursement standards, low repayment rates, high transaction costs and recurring losses, leading the institutions to distress. The exploitation of customers by unregulated institutions would adversely affect the recipients of microfinance and keep the low income segments within the 'cycle of poverty'. At the same time, such practices would affect the consumer confidence in the financial sector, including the formal regulated sector. Low confidence in the financial sector would adversely affect financial system stability. Therefore, there was a necessity to regulate and supervise entities engaged in microfinance business in Sri Lanka.",

South Korea also introduced a Framework on Low Carbon Green Growth and a five year plan to implement a green growth strategy covering green financing with the intention of promoting a carbon-trading system and infrastructure for green finance.

It facilitates collective learning of members, and supports them in policy development and related initiatives to create drivers for sustainable finance in their home countries. The idea for SBN emerged during the first International Green Credit Forum hosted by the IFC and the China Banking Regulatory Commission, in Beijing, in May 2012, where banking regulators and associations from 10 countries requested that IFC facilitate a global knowledge network on sustainable banking. The Network was formally launched in September 2012. Among SBN members, the Bangladesh Bank introduced environmental risk management guidelines and policy guidelines for green banking, in 2011, to address policy and governance of green banking. China introduced \u2018Green Credit Guidelines\u2019 in 2012 for banks to consider environmental impact and energy efficiency as a part of lending decisions and to implement green banking. In 2015, China also introduced green credit key performance indicators to strengthen, monitor and evaluate green banking.

Maintaining financial system stability can be described as ensuring a stable financial system where financial intermediaries can engage in transactions based on a smooth and efficient market infrastructure to promote economic growth. To maintain financial system stability, sound payment systems with minimal risk should be in place to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial sector. As all the participants of the payment system are interrelated, if one participant is exposed to risk, it may spread to other participants, causing systemic risk. Systemic risk is the risk of an entire system collapsing due to the \u2018domino effect\u2019 (a chain reaction) caused by the failure of one or more members of the system. In a payment system, credit or liquidity problems experienced by one member of the system could trigger a chain reaction, which will then affect other members of the same system.",
