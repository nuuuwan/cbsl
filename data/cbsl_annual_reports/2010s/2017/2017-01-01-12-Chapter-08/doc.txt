8.1 OverviewT

he financial sector continued to expand

during the year whilst exhibiting

resilience amidst challenging market

conditions both globally and domestically.

Along with the expansion, the stability of the financial

system was maintained without causing any major

macroprudential concerns in an environment of

supportive regulatory measures for stability. The

growth of the financial sector was buoyed by the

expansion in banking, other deposit taking financial

institutions and contractual savings institutions.

The banking sector maintained its capital

and liquidity levels well above the statutory

minimum requirement while assets of the sector

recorded a lower growth in 2016 compared to

2015. The increase in banking assets was mainly

driven by the expansion in loans and advances

in line with the growth in deposits. Borrowings of

the banking sector declined during the year with a

drop in foreign currency borrowings enabling banks

to manage foreign currency exposures within the

prudential limits. The increase in interest income of

the banking sector mainly contributed to the higher

profitability of the banking sector as reflected in

Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity

(ROE). Meanwhile, asset quality measured by

the Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio recorded its

lowest level for the last two decades.

The licensed finance companies (LFCs) and

specialised leasing companies (SLCs) sector

showed an expansion in the asset base. The

growth in assets during the year was funded by

domestic borrowings and deposits. Although credit

growth decelerated in the first quarter of 2016 as a

result of macroprudential measures with respect

to the lending on motor vehicles, the improvement

in other lending activities in the second half of the

year caused a rebound in the expansion of credit.

Despite weak financial position of few LFCs, liquidity,

capital and NPL levels of the sector remained healthy

while profitability as reflected in the ROA and ROE

increased during the year. Insurance sector, even

though, marked a growth in terms of both assets and

total profits during the year, remained considerably

underpenetrated compared to peer countries and

is yet to grasp its full potential. Contractual savings

institutions including the Employees’ Provident Fund

(EPF) and the Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) also

recorded healthy growth providing reasonable returns

for their members.

Domestic financial markets continued to be

volatile during the year in response to changing

local and global economic environment. Excess

rupee liquidity in the domestic money market

declined gradually into deficit levels during the

year and rebounded to a surplus by end December

2016. The Sri Lankan rupee continued to depreciate

against the US dollar during 2016 reflecting high

demand in the domestic foreign exchange market,

exacerbated capital outflows and import related

demand. The domestic equity market was sluggish

during the year in an environment of upward

revisions in interest rates in both domestic and US

markets, and the depreciation of exchange rates.

The national payment and settlement systems

facilitated smooth, reliable and safe mechanism

for efficient settlement of transactions without any

major systemic risk at both retail and large value

payment systems. The values and volume of the

transactions handled by national payment and

settlement systems increased during the year in

line with the expansion in financial sector of the

country.

Strengthening of the supervisory and

regulatory framework governing the financial

sector continued during the year to ensure that

potential risks to financial system stability are

addressed in a timely manner. Several prudential

measures taken by the Central Bank targeting

banking and LFC and SLC sector stability mainly

focused on cyber security, enhancing transparency

and capital requirements under the Basel III

framework. In addition, the Microfinance Act,

No. 6 of 2016 was enacted with the objective of

regulating microfinance institutions and the Central

Bank issued prudential directions with respect to

licensed microfinance companies (LMFCs) and

guidelines to the Registrar of Voluntary Social

Services Organisations for the regulation and

supervision of microfinance non-governmental

organisations during the year.With regard to the

insurance sector, the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka

(IBSL) issued directions with respect to the ownership

of insurance companies, share capital, complaints

handling by insurers and brokers, and cooling-off period

to examine the terms and conditions of the policy

documents during the year 2016.

8.2 Performance of the Banking Sector

The asset base of the banking sector expanded

by Rs. 969 billion during the year surpassing Rs.

9 trillion by end December 2016 albeit at a slower

growth of 12.0 per cent (y-o-y) in 2016 compared

to 15.9 per cent reported in 2015. The increase in

assets was mainly attributed to the increase in loans

and advances of Rs. 825 billion, which was primarily

funded by a growth in deposits of 16.5 per cent during the

year. Borrowings of the banking sector declined to Rs.

1.7 trillion with a negative growth of 3.5 per cent in 2016

compared to the growth of 21.4 per cent in 2015. This was

mainly due to decrease in foreign currency borrowings

by US dollars 319 million recording a decline of 4.4 per

cent compared to the previous year. Profit recorded an

increase mainly arising from higher net interest income.

Profitability of the banking sector as reflected in ROA and

ROE increased during the period. The banking sector

continued to manage its risks prudently during the year

and maintained a comfortable level of liquidity and capital.

The asset quality improved during the year recording the

lowest NPL ratio in the past two decades. Meanwhile,

interest rate risk and re-pricing risks increased due to

upward movements in interest rates. The banking sector

expanded its operations throughout the year through the

establishment of new banking outlets and installation of

new Automated Teller Machines (ATMs).

Business Growth

(a) Outreach: By the end of 2016, the banking

sector consisted of 25 licensed commercial banks

(LCBs) and 7 licensed specialised banks (LSBs).

There were 12 branches of foreign banks within the

total number of LCBs. The banking sector continued

to contribute to economic activity and development

throughout the year by enhancing banking services and

expanding its network and accessibility throughout the

country. Accordingly, 70 new banking outlets (excluding

student savings units) were opened and 366 new ATMs

were installed during the year. By end 2016, there were

6,659 banking outlets and 3,843 ATMs installed for

the purpose of providing efficient banking operations.

During the year, approvals were granted for 1 LCB to

open a branch in Maldives and for another LCB to open

a branch in Bangladesh and to commence a banking

subsidiary for microfinance in Myanmar.

(b) Assets: The asset portfolio of the banking

sector further expanded during the year, reaching

Rs. 9 trillion by end 2016. The asset portfolio mainly

consisted of loans and advances, which accounted

for 61.2 per cent of the banking assets. Accordingly,

the loan portfolio was the major contributor to the

17.5 per cent increase of the total asset portfolio

(Rs. 825 billion) during 2016 compared to 21.1 per

cent (Rs. 821 billion) in the previous year. Loans

and advances were extended to all major sectors of

the economy. About 91.8 per cent of the increase

in the loan portfolio of the banking sector was

attributed to the increase in rupee loans. While the

pawning portfolio contracted during the year, the

leasing portfolio expanded only marginally by Rs.

7.8 billion (3.3 per cent) in 2016, compared to Rs.

81.1 billion (52.9 per cent) in 2015. This could be

attributed to the implementation of the loan to value

ratio in respect of loans and advances granted

by licensed banks for the purpose of purchase

or utilisation of motor vehicles. Meanwhile, the

investments portfolio contracted to 25.1 per cent

of the asset portfolio as it reported a negative

growth of 3.3 per cent during 2016 compared to

the significant growth of 21.8 per cent during the

preceding year.

(c) Liabilities: The customer deposits

continued to be the major source of liabilities which

accounted for 69.6 per cent of the total liabilities

of the banking sector. The deposit base of the

banking sector increased during the year mainly

due to the increase in term deposits denominated

in Sri Lankan rupees. Time deposits reported an

increase of 23.8 per cent in 2016 compared to

an increase of 13.9 per cent in the previous year.

As a consequence, the share of time deposits

as a percentage of total deposits increased to

60.6 per cent in 2016 from 57.0 per cent in 2015.

Meanwhile, there was an increase in savings and

current account deposits during the year growing

at a slower rate of 7.4 per cent and 7.3 per cent,

respectively, in 2016 compared to a growth of

18.3 per cent and 17.2 per cent, respectively, in

2015. The increase in term deposits was partly

attributed to the upward movement in interest

rates during the year. The current accounts

and savings accounts (CASA) ratio decreased

marginally to 37.1 per cent by end 2016 from

40.3 per cent in 2015 indicating a decline in low

cost funding. Total borrowings of the banking

sector displayed a negative growth of 3.5 per cent

due to foreign borrowings declining by Rs. 47.8

billion and rupee borrowings declining by Rs. 14.2

billion. Nevertheless, foreign currency borrowings

accounted for major share of total borrowings

representing 60.7 per cent.

(d) Off-Balance Sheet Exposure: Off-balance

sheet exposure more than doubled during the

year increasing by Rs. 3,794 billion to Rs. 7,158

billion due to increase in undrawn credit, forward

purchases and forward sales. Off-balance sheet

exposure was mainly concentrated in the sectors

of foreign exchange purchases (37.2 per cent)

and sales (29.1 per cent), undrawn credit lines

(15.0 per cent), which together accounted for

81.3 per cent of the off-balance sheet exposures.

Guarantees and bonds, documentary credit,

derivatives, acceptances and other non-funded

activities contributed to the remaining share of off-

balance sheet exposures.

Risks in the Banking Sector

(a) Credit Risk: Risk weighted assets

for credit risk increased during the year with

increased lending and the expansion of loan

portfolios. Credit quality improved substantially

during the year due to aggressive credit

recovery policies adopted by banks. The NPL

ratio declined further to 2.6 per cent in 2016

from 3.2 per cent in 2015 due to a decline in

NPLs by an absolute amount of Rs. 10.6 billion.

Total provisions increased by Rs. 6.9 billion

mainly with an increase in specific provisions

made for NPLs reporting a specific provision

coverage ratio of 52.1 per cent.

The credit portfolio was diversified across

certain sectors such as construction (17.8 per

cent), traders (14.0 per cent), manufacturing

(10.7 per cent), and agriculture and fishing (9.0

per cent), which accounted for more than 50

per cent of the credit portfolio.

(b) Market Risk: Risk weighted assets for market

risk increased during 2016 to Rs. 144 billion from Rs.

125 billion as at end 2015 due to increase in foreign

currency risk resulting in an increase in the capital

charge.

Interest Rates: Market interest rates increased

during the year causing an increase in the re-pricing

risk. A net capital gain of Rs. 3.2 billion from the sale of

Treasury bonds was reported during the year despite

the volatility in interest rates. The cumulative interest

rate sensitive gap of the banking sector, which is

the gap between interest rate sensitive assets and

interest rate sensitive liabilities as a percentage of

interest rate sensitive assets up to 12 months’ time

bucket widened to negative 33.7 per cent as at end

2016 compared to negative 17.3 per cent as at end

2015.

Prices of Equity: Equity risk of the banking sector

remained at low levels during the year as the exposure

to the equity market in the form of investments in listed

shares was minimal at Rs. 22.1 billion. This was only

1.4 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively, of total

investments and total assets of the banking sector.

Foreign Currency Risk: The foreign currency

risk of the banking sector increased during the

year due to increase in foreign currency deposits,

despite a decline in foreign currency borrowings. The

banking sector reported Rs. 16.4 billion more foreign

currency denominated assets than foreign currency

denominated liabilities (long foreign currency

exposure). This long foreign currency exposure as

a percentage of the banks’ regulatory capital and

on balance sheet assets stood at 2.1 per cent and

0.2 per cent, respectively, by end 2016. The banking

sector reported a net gain of Rs. 12.3 billion at the end

of 2016 resulting from the depreciation of the rupee

against the US dollar.

(c) Liquidity Risk: There was excess liquidity in

the banking sector during 2016 despite high demand

for lending. The statutory liquid assets ratios (SLARs)

of the domestic banking units (DBUs) and offshore

banking units (OBUs) were maintained well above

the minimum statutory level at 30.0 per cent and

35.3 per cent, respectively. However, SLAR of DBUs

decreased by 400 basis points during the year as a

result of increased lending. Accordingly, the loans to

deposits ratio increased to 88.0 per cent in 2016 from

87.3 per cent in 2015.

Liquid assets to total assets and liquid assets to

total deposits decreased by 280 basis points and 575

basis points, respectively, during the year. Total liquid

assets stood at Rs. 2,466 billion and Treasury bills,

Treasury bonds, Sri Lanka Development Bonds and

balances with banks contributed to 86.1 per cent of

total liquid assets.

The cumulative maturity gap as a percentage of

cumulative liabilities of the banking sector narrowed

for the maturity time periods (buckets) less than 3

months and widened for maturity time periods

greater than 3 months and less than 12 months.

The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) for rupee

liquidity requirements and all currency liquidity

requirements of the banking sector were 199.2 per

cent and 152.8 per cent, respectively, remaining

well above the stipulated minimum requirement of

70.0 per cent as at end December 2016.

Profitability and Capital Resources

(a) Profitability: The net interest income of

the banking sector increased at a slower rate

than in 2015 recording a growth of 14.4 per cent,

mainly due to the increase in interest expenses by

39.4 per cent. However, the net interest income

as a percentage of average assets increased

marginally during 2016. Non-interest income

increased by about 6 per cent during the year

despite a negative growth in foreign exchange

income.

Non-interest expenses also increased

significantly by 10.6 per cent due to increase in

staff costs. While profit after tax of the banking

sector stood at Rs. 116 billion with an increase

of 19.5 per cent, ROE increased by 110 basis

points during the year, reporting a ratio of

17.3 per cent. However, ROA increased only

marginally to 1.4 per cent in 2016 from 1.3 per

cent in the previous year. The interest margin

remained unchanged at 3.6 per cent. Cost to

income ratio has deteriorated to 75.6 per cent in

2016 from 73.1 per cent in 2015. Meanwhile, the

efficiency ratio, as measured by relative share of

non-interest expenses to total income, improved

by 164 basis points due to a decrease in the ratio

of staff costs to operating expenses.

(b) Capital: The banking sector maintained

its capital at a comfortable level during the year

enhancing the capacity to absorb any adverse

shocks. Capital adequacy ratios of the banking

sector demonstrated a declining trend, but continued

to be at a level higher than the minimum regulatory

requirements. Subsequent to the inclusion of

estimated profits for 2016, the core capital adequacy

ratio (CAR) and total CAR as at end December 2016,

1 Introduction

The global financial crisis, which emerged during the period of 2008-2012, compelled the regulators to introduce new regulations while strengthening the existing regulations for enhancing the safety and soundness of the financial institutions. The excessive risk taken through on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures by banks with securitisations of sub-prime mortgages led to heavy losses, thereby eroding banks’ capital. Many reputed financial institutions around the globe with large amounts of assets, which were considered by the market as Too-Big-To-Fail, were severely affected. Accordingly, certain large institutions were rescued by implementing various measures, including taking over or merging with other financial institutions, nationalisation and bailing-out by the respective governments, while some financial institutions were declared insolvent or liquidated. With these consequences, regulators around the globe emphasised the need to enhance quality and quantity of capital of banks. Accordingly, regulators have focused on increasing minimum capital requirements, which were required to be met with capital components with a higher loss absorbing capacity such as common shares, share premium and retained earnings.

2 Regulatory Developments with respect to Capital - The Basel Capital Accord

2.1 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel has implemented a series of international standards for bank regulations on capital adequacy commonly known as Basel Accord. The Basel Committee issued its first Accord in 1988 (Basel I) requiring banks to maintain a minimum ratio of capital to risk weighted assets - capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 8 per cent. It was strengthened by introducing Basel II in 2004 which comprised three pillars, viz. minimum capital requirements, supervisory review process and market discipline.

2.2 In response to the global financial crisis, the three pillars introduced under Basel II were strengthened by adding several new components and in December 2010, the Basel Committee issued advanced global standards (Basel III) for strengthening the capital adequacy framework. These standards were focused on increasing high quality capital, eliminating inconsistencies in the definition of capital across the jurisdictions and enhancing disclosure requirements to assess and compare the quality of capital. The Basel III requirements were implemented on a staggered basis commencing 1 January 2013.

BOX 10Strengthening Capital Regulations to enhance the Resilience of Banks

3 Salient Features of Basel III

3.1 Definition of Capital

The Basel regulations have specified the elements of capital which includes,

(i) Tier I capital - Going concern capital

• Common equity Tier I capital

• Additional Tier I

(ii) Tier II capital - Gone concern capital

The Committee has indicated a set of criteria to be met before inclusion in the relevant category. Further, the above capital components need to be maintained at all times as follows.

• Common equity Tier I must be at least 4.5 per cent of risk weighted assets• Tier I capital must be at least 6 per cent of risk weighted assets• Total capital i.e. Tier I and Tier II, must be at least 8 per cent of risk weighted assets

3.2 Introducing the Bail-in Provisions

The Committee has introduced bail-in provisions where creditors of a bank will get involved in rescuing the bank before the involvement of external parties. In this regard, subordinated debentures included in additional Tier I and Tier II can be converted to equity at a point of non-viability as determined by the regulator. These financial instruments will qualify for regulatory capital purposes only if the bank has issued it with the feature of convertibility. Thus, before a bail-out by a relevant authority, banks are allowed to convert the contingent convertible capital instruments to absorb losses when the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level.

3.3 Introducing the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB)

The Basel III Framework has introduced CCB to ensure that banks build up capital buffers during good periods, which can be drawn down during stress periods. Holding additional capital buffers compels banks to retain greater proportion of earnings without generously distributing it to shareholders and place depositors’ interest above shareholders’ interests. CCB of 2.5 per cent comprising common equity Tier I will be fully effective by 01 January 2019.

3.4 Identifying Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)

Failures of globally active large banks during the financial crisis and its impact to the real economy led the Committee to strengthen the resilience

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

of such banks in addition to the capital adequacy measures, which are commonly applicable to all banks. Accordingly, G-SIBs are identified based on selected indicators of systemic importance viz. the size of the banks, their interconnectedness, lack of readily available substitutes or financial institution infrastructure for the services they provide, their global activity and complexity. In order to reduce the probability of failure of G-SIBS, such banks are required to increase their loss absorbing capacity by maintaining an additional capital buffer (ranging from 1 per cent - 3.5 per cent of Risk Weighted Assets) comprising Common Equity Tier I Capital.

3.5 Introducing the Countercyclical Buffer

The framework has introduced countercyclical capital buffer to protect banks from risks arising from the excess credit growth in the economy, which can lead to a system wide risk in the banking sector. If such a systemic risk is observed by a national authority, it is empowered to decide the size of the countercyclical buffer that varies from 0 per cent to 2.5 per cent of the Risk Weighted Assets.

3.6 Introducing the Leverage Ratio

During the period of global financial crisis, the financial regulators identified that one of the reasons for the crisis was building excessive on and off balance sheet leverage by banks while maintaining healthy capital ratios. Therefore, the Basel Committee has introduced a simple, transparent and non-risk based leverage ratio as a supplementary measure to the risk based capital requirement. The Committee has set a minimum Tier I leverage ratio of 3 per cent, measured as capital to total exposure, comprising both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures.

3.7 Reforms to the Counterparty Credit Risk Framework

The Basel III has introduced measures to strengthen the capital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposures and risk management, focusing on the risk arising from derivatives, repo and securities financing activities. Accordingly, banks will be subject to a capital charge for potential marked-to-market losses, caused by the deterioration of worthiness credit of the counterparty.

4 Implementation of Basel III for Licensed Banks in Sri Lanka

Basel regulations on Capital Framework were adopted by banks in Sri Lanka since 2008 with the introduction of capital adequacy ratio. Progressing

towards Basel III, the Central Bank issued Banking Act Directions No.01 of 2016 on Capital Requirement under Basel III for licensed commercial banks and licensed specialised banks.

In terms of the Banking Act Directions on Basel III, July 2017, licensed banks are required to maintain minimum capital requirements and buffers with respect to its risk weighted assets.

In line with the capital requirements for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) by the Basel Committee, Central Bank imposed a capital surcharge buffer of 1.5 per cent for D-SIBs which are identified as banks with assets over Rs. 500 billion or more. At present, there are 6 such banks in the country accounting for 71 per cent of the total banking assets. The minimum capital requirement for D-SIBs are given in Table B 10.1

stood at 11.4 per cent and 14.3 per cent, respectively.

The regulatory capital was composed of Tier I and

Tier II capital of which Tier I capital contributed to

nearly 80 per cent of the total regulatory capital. Tier I

capital constituted primarily of share capital, retained

profits, and general and other reserves. Almost 85.8

5 Way Forward

5.1 Enhanced Minimum Capital Requirement

The Central Bank intends to increase the minimum capital requirement for existing and new banks to be established in Sri Lanka from the existing minimum capital requirement of Rs. 10 billion. for licensed commercial banks and Rs. 5 billion for licensed specialised banks and branches of foreign banks. in order to enhance the resilience of the domestic banking sector.

5.2 Meeting Enhanced Capital Requirements on a Staggered Basis

Commencing 1 July 2017, banks need to comply with minimum capital ratios. However adhering to Basel III minimum capital requirement will be challenging for banks that currently have CAR marginally above the regulatory minimum. Hence, banks with lower

CAR may need to infuse share capital or will need to build capital internally by limiting dividends and other discretionary payments. CBSL is closely monitoring the readiness of the banks to comply with these requirements.

Although raising capital will increase the cost of funds, banks’ will benefit through high credit rating, leading to a reuction of the risk premium charged when raising funds for banking operations.

5.3 Leverage Ratio

The Consultation Paper on Leverage Ratio was issued to licensed banks in early 2017 and commencing 31 March 2017, banks are requested to report the Leverage Ratio for monitoring purposes. The Directions on Leverage Ratio will be issued by the Central Bank consequent to BCBS issuing the final guidelines.

per cent of Tier II capital comprised subordinated term

debt, while the revaluation reserve represented 9.6

per cent. The banking sector actively engaged in the

issuance of debentures during the year and retained

a portion of earnings of banks as internally generated

capital to maintain capital at a sustainable level as per

the regulatory requirements.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

The Central Bank initiated several measures

to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory

framework for licensed banks with the view

to further promoting safety and soundness of

the banking sector thereby enhancing public

confidence in the sector. Considering the

increasing risk in cyber security, on 25 January

2016, a Circular was issued to licensed banks

requiring them to report cyber security events

within 1 working day of the detection of any event

and within 15 days from the end of each quarter

regulatory capital position of such bank until the bank

complies with the Direction. In addition, commencing

from 1 July 2017, all licensed banks are required to

disclose key information on regulatory capital, liquidity

and risk management with the published financial

statements with comparative information on both solo

and consolidated basis.

8.3 Performance of Non-Banking Financial Institutions

Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised Leasing Companies (LFCs/SLCs) Sector

The LFCs/SLCs sector recorded a strong

performance in terms of asset growth and

branch network expansion during 2016

amidst a challenging business environment,

while placing emphasis on gradually moving

out from its core business of vehicle financing

to other loan products. The growth in the sector

was mainly funded through domestic borrowings.

While maintaining the growth, risk remained under

control, as reflected in healthy level of NPLs and

comfortable liquidity and capital levels. However, as

risks emanating from few LFCs with weak financial

positions could cause macroprudential concerns on

financial system stability of the country, the Central

Bank continued to adopt prudential measures with a

specific focus on reviving the aforementioned weak

companies to maintain stability of the sector.

Business Growth

(a) Outreach: By end 2016, this sector

comprised of 46 LFCs, 7 SLCs and 1,313 branches,

out of which 886 branches were located outside the

Western Province. During the year, a new finance

leasing licence for Sarvodaya Development Finance

Ltd. was granted and the finance leasing licence of

People’s Bank was cancelled on their request while

101 new branches were added to the branch network.

with immediate effect. With a view to expanding

disclosures to customers by banks, on 1 February

2016, a Circular was issued to licensed banks

to display fees charged from customers for fund

transfers through the Lankasettle System, Sri Lanka

Inter Bank Payment System (SLIPS) and Common

Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS) in all

branches and publish same in banks’ website in the

given format commencing from 10 February 2016.

The aforementioned fees will be determined by the

Central Bank and communicated to all banks.

Meanwhile, in order to promote the secondary

market for government securities by enhancing

transparency and price discovery, a Circular dated

1 September 2016 on secondary market trading of

government securities and reporting by licensed

banks was issued to licensed banks requiring

banks to use the Bloomberg trading platform

available to Sri Lanka to conduct all outright

trades with other banks and primary dealers and

to report yield rates and volumes of all outright

trades carried out over-the-counter in excess of

Rs. 50 million, within 30 minutes of each such trade

commencing 15 September 2016. The Central Bank

further strengthened capital regulations of banks by

issuing Banking Act Direction No. 01 of 2016 dated 29

December 2016, on Capital Requirements under Basel

III for licensed banks requiring banks to maintain the

minimum capital ratios and buffers in respect of total

risk weighted assets commencing from 1 July 2017.

Accordingly, commencing from 1 July 2017, large banks

maintaining assets over Rs. 500 billion will be required

to maintain a Tier I capital ratio of 10.0 per cent and total

ratio of 14.0 per cent while other banks will be required to

maintain a Tier I capital ratio of 8.5 per cent and total ratio

of 12.5 per cent by 1 January 2019. In order to ensure

the compliance with minimum capital requirements,

banks which fail to comply with the requirements, will

not be permitted to pay dividends or repatriate profits or

adopt any other measure that will further deteriorate the

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

(b) Assets: During 2016, the LFCs/SLCs sector

was able to expand their asset base exceeding the

one trillion rupee mark while maintaining marginally

lower growth than in previous year. The total asset

base of the sector grew by 21.7 per cent (Rs. 215.8

billion) in 2016 to Rs. 1,211.9 billion compared to a

growth of 22.3 per cent (Rs. 181.6 billion) in 2015.

The 77.3 per cent growth of assets was mainly led

by lending activities. The increased assets were

funded mainly through borrowings by 57.6 per cent

and the balance by deposits, equity capital and other

liabilities which represented 23.3, 10.6 and 8.4 per

cent, respectively.

Credit growth of the LFCs/SLCs sector

moderated during the first quarter of 2016 as a

result of macroprudential measures implemented

with respect to the lending on motor vehicles

mainly in the form of a loan to value ratio (LTV).

However, with the increased exposure to other

lending products, the credit growth accelerated

during the second half of 2016 resulting in an

overall expansion of credit of 21.0 per cent (Rs.

166.8 billion) to Rs. 962.7 billion as at end 2016,

compared to a high growth rate of 31.8 per cent

(Rs. 192.1 billion) during 2015. Around 73.1 per

cent of this credit growth was mainly through other

loan products such as term loans, revolving loans,

microfinance, factoring and draft loans, while 23.7

per cent was through finance leases and hire

purchases.

The investment portfolio comprises of investments

in equities, corporate debt instruments, government

securities and investment properties and recorded

a growth of 12.1 per cent in 2016 compared to a

negative growth of 9.2 per cent in 2015. This was

mainly on account of increased investments in

short-term government securities. Other assets

comprised of cash, balances with banks and financial

institutions, trading stocks and fixed assets, showed

an increase of 36.6 per cent in 2016 largely due

to increased placements in banks and financial

institutions.

(c) Liabilities: The sector’s reliance on retail

deposits has gradually shifted towards bank

borrowings over the past two years considering the

flexibility and cost factor. This has changed the overall

funding structure of the sector by increasing the share

of borrowings to 36.2 per cent in 2016 from 31.6 per

cent in 2015, while the share of deposits decreased

to 43.8 per cent in 2016 from 48.3 per cent in 2015.

During 2016, the borrowings increased by 39.6 per

cent or Rs. 124.4 billion to Rs. 438.7 in absolute terms

compared to a growth of 44.6 per cent recorded in

2015. The borrowings are predominantly from the

banking and finance sector (58.5 per cent) followed

by debenture issues (16.5 per cent), foreign

borrowings (4.9 per cent) and overdraft facilities

(4.5 per cent).

The deposits recorded a moderate growth of

10.5 per cent or Rs. 50.3 billion to Rs. 531.0 billion

in 2016, compared to a 16.1 per cent growth in

2015. The deposit mobilisation was mainly through

time deposits accounting for 95.6 per cent of the

total deposits, whilst the residual was mainly from

savings deposits.

The capital elements of the sector increased by

18.7 per cent to Rs. 146.1 billion as at end 2016,

mainly on account of internally generated profits.

Risks in the LFCs/SLCs sector

(a) Credit Risk: Amidst the growth in the sector,

the quality of loans portfolio was maintained due to

aggressive credit recovery policies adopted by LFCs

and SLCs. The NPL ratio showed a decline from 5.7

per cent in 2015 to 5.3 per cent in 2016. The increase

of Rs. 5.6 billion in NPLs in 2016 was not significant

compared to higher growth of the loan portfolio. The

total loan loss provisions increased by Rs. 5.9 billion

to Rs. 34.8 billion mainly due to an increase in the

specific provisions made for NPLs with a delinquency

period of more than 12 to 24 months. As a result,

the net NPL ratio decreased to 1.2 per cent as at end

of 2016 compared to 1.6 per cent in 2015 and the

provision coverage increased to 65.7 per cent in 2016

compared to 61.0 per cent enabling a minimisation of

potential default risk of the sector.

(b) Market Risk: The LFCs and SLCs continued

to experience a minimal market risk due to the lower

exposure to trading portfolio and foreign currency

transactions. Market interest rates increased

during the year, resulting higher “re-pricing risk”,

which reduced the sector margin due to prevailing

negative assets and liabilities mismatch. However,

the increased interest rate risk was minimised due

to the improvement of the negative assets and

liabilities mismatch up to 12 months’ time bucket.

(c) Liquidity Risk: The excess liquidity in the

LFCs/SLCs sector witnessed in the previous year

continued to remain high during the year under

review amidst increased lending activities of the

sector. The overall statutory liquid assets available

in the LFCs/SLCs sector were at a surplus of Rs.

15.4 billion by end 2016 compared to the stipulated

minimum requirement of Rs. 74.7 billion. About 74.9

per cent liquid assets of the sector were in the form

of government securities. The liquid assets to total

assets ratio decreased marginally to 7.1 per cent

from 7.6 per cent in 2015. Further, the liquid asset to

deposits ratio was well above the statutory minimum

of 10.0 per cent of time deposits and unsecured

borrowings and 15.0 per cent of savings deposits.

Profitability and Capital Resources

(a) Profitability: Greater business expansion of

the LFCs/SLCs sector in to new areas of lending

during the year enabled the sector to post increased

level of profits. Accordingly, the sector posted a

profit after tax of Rs. 31.5 billion compared to that

of Rs. 15.2 billion in 2015 reporting a more than

two fold increase. Increased business volumes,

improved other income and improved operational

efficiency were the main contributory factors for

increased profits. The net interest income of the

sector increased at a slower rate of 12.0 per cent to

Rs. 92.1 billion compared to 32.0 per cent increase

in the previous year, mainly due to increased funding

cost, while this affected the net interest margin of

the sector negatively as it declined to 7.9 per cent

from 8.7 per cent in 2015. The non-interest income

recorded an increase in comparison to 2015 mainly

on account of default and service charges, while

the non-interest expenses decreased marginally

leading to an improved efficiency ratio. The loan loss

provisions made against NPLs was lower by Rs. 1.9

billion during 2016 when compared to Rs. 9.5 billion

reported for 2015. The profitability indicators of the

sector, ROA and ROE, increased to 4.0 per cent and

23.1 per cent, respectively, in 2016 compared to 3.0

per cent and 12.4 per cent, respectively, in 2015.

(b) Capital: The total regulatory capital of the

sector improved by 25.1 per cent to Rs. 116.2 billion

mainly due to retained profits. The regulatory capital

was composed of Tier I and Tier II capital of which,

the Tier I capital contributed to 97.2 per cent of the

total regulatory capital. The core capital and total

risk weighted capital ratios of the sector increased

to 11.4 and 11.7 per cent, respectively, as at end

2016 from 10.5 and 11.2 per cent, respectively, as

at end of 2015. However, there were few companies

operating below the minimum required capital levels

due to weak financial position, requiring the Central

Bank to adopt certain measures to rectify such

issues.

Action on Distressed Licensed Finance Companies

The existing distressed finance companies

in the sector with negative capital and

inadequate liquidity position still continued in

the process of revival at various stages. During

the year, the Central Bank attached highest priority

to resolve these companies under the statutory

powers it encompasses. A resolution plan for 3

financially distressed companies was principally

approved by the Monetary Board subject to

legal and other clearances required for proper

implementation. As announced in the Government

Budget 2016, action has been taken to set up a

Financial Asset Management Agency and draft Bill

has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Boards of three companies were reconstituted

with the view to restructuring and stabilising the

company. In addition, regular meetings were held

with stakeholders of these companies while efforts

were made to find prospective investors to infuse

capital for the purpose of restructuring.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

Throughout 2016, the Central Bank closely

monitored the developments in the LFCs/

SLCs sector especially the gradual movement

of business concentration towards other loan

products as a result of policy measures taken

to curtail vehicle importation since 2015. Further,

in view of strengthening the regulatory framework

of LFCs/SLCs, a detailed review was conducted

on the existing regulatory framework. This was

conducted to keep the pace with international

and local developments in the financial industry,

emerging international best practices guided by the

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and other

standard setting bodies. Accordingly, the Central

Bank is in the process of introducing new regulations

along with the consultation with stakeholders of the

sector.

In addition, LFCs and SLCs were given guidance

to focus more on their branch expansion

strategies in view of balancing the financial

inclusion objective and internal strengths through

business efficiency. Hence, a new framework

on branch openings, closure and relocation was

introduced by streamlining the existing policies

and practices. Further, a policy was implemented

to encourage LFCs/SLCs to open only branches

instead of other outlets in view of streamlining the

branch expansion process. The methodology used

in setting the maximum upper limit of interest rates

on deposits and debt instruments was revised to

neutralise the impact of sudden changes in the

interest rates.

Microfinance Institutions Sector

A regulatory framework for microfinance

companies was introduced by the Central

Bank during the year in terms of the powers

vested under the Microfinance Act, No. 6 of

2016 (Microfinance Act), which came into effect

on 15th July 2016. The regulatory framework is

intended for licensing, regulation and supervision

of microfinance companies and Microfinance

Non-Governmental Organisations (MNGOs).

Accordingly, the Central Bank issued rules

focusing on licencing criteria and licence fee, while

prudential directions covering minimum core capital,

Overview

Financial inclusion, simply defined as the proportion of individuals and firms that use (not just have access to) financial services, is an essential element of financial sector development in any part of the world. Without access to formal financial services, the unserved and underserved segments of society will be excluded from economic growth and its benefits and would be lured by the informal financial sector. The low income customers and microenterprises are generally neglected by formal financial institutions due to their low income and inability to provide collateral and thereby, lack of access to basic financial services. Nevertheless, microfinance functions as a tool of financial inclusion by providing various financial services including; loans, savings, insurance, remittances and other services, such as training and consultation, targeting these low income customers and microenterprises. By providing access to financial services, microfinance is expected to expand and improve income generation activities and capacity of low income persons and microenterprises and thereby ensure benefits for the society as a whole, through effective allocation of economic resources.

In Sri Lanka, unregulated microfinance activities have led to various issues including illegal deposit mobilisation, exploitation of customers through excessive interest rates and unethical recovery methods. Furthermore, poor corporate governance, and weak systems and controls in these institutions could result in weak credit disbursement standards, low repayment rates, high transaction costs and recurring losses, leading the institutions to distress. The exploitation of customers by unregulated institutions would adversely affect the recipients of microfinance and keep the low income segments within the 'cycle of poverty'. At the same time, such practices would affect the consumer confidence in the financial sector, including the formal regulated sector. Low confidence in the financial sector would adversely affect financial system stability. Therefore, there was a necessity to regulate and supervise entities engaged in microfinance business in Sri Lanka.

Streamlining the operations of microfinance institutions, through regulation and supervision, is essential for transmitting the real benefits accruing from operations of Micro Finance Institution (MFI) to the society, effectively. A regulatory mechanism for microfinance is expected to ensure the financial soundness of microfinance institutions, making their operations efficient, viable and sustainable. With the implementation of a sound regulatory framework, effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of financial services to low income persons, and microenterprises, would improve and thereby, increase financial inclusion. Being regulated under a regulatory and supervisory authority would facilitate microfinance institutions to access wider sources of funding (including

BOX 11Regulatory Framework under the Microfinance Act, No. 6 of 2016

becoming partners with the State, the Central Bank, donors and other credit institutions). Further, a regulatory mechanism would lead to the promotion of consumer protection standards and the safety of deposits, which would finally lead to a safe, efficient and stable financial system.

The Microfinance Act, No.6 of 2016

The Microfinance Act, No. 6 of 2016 (the Act) came into effect on 15 July 2016, with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka entrusted with the responsibility of licensing, regulation and supervision of microfinance companies in Sri Lanka. The Act further provides for the registration of Non-Governmental Organisations1 that accept limited savings deposits by the Registrar of Voluntary Social Service Organisations, as Microfinance Non-Governmental Organisations (Microfinance NGOs). The Act also provides for the establishment of principles, standards and guidelines for the regulation and supervision of Microfinance NGOs by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (Monetary Board).

(iii) Regulatory and Supervisory Structure

The Act provides for the licensing of microfinance companies, and the regulation and supervision of LMFCs through the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (Monetary Board). The Microfinance NGOs are registered, regulated and supervised by the Registrar of Voluntary Social Service Organizations (Registrar of VSSO). However, the Monetary Board is required to set principles, standards or issue guidelines for their supervision, to which the Registrar of VSSO shall give effect through Rules issued to Microfinance NGOs. The structure established for the regulation and supervision of microfinance institutions is described in the diagram, below.

(iv) Licensing Requirements

The Central Bank also set principles, standards

and guidelines to be issued to the Registrar of

Voluntary Social Service Organisations (Registrar

of VSSO) for the regulation of MNGOs. Licensing

of new microfinance companies and registration

of new MNGOs are expected to be commenced

during the year 2017.

Primary Dealers in Government Securities

The Primary Dealer (PD) sector recorded

gradual moderation of its activities during the

year. Total assets and total investment portfolio

of 7 LCB primary dealers and 8 standalone PDs

recorded a decline, whereas the total capital

and profitability of the sector recorded a growth.

Significant impairment of the assets of a particular

PD, rapidly increasing interest rates, and the

withdrawal of primary dealership by another

company with effect from 01.04.2016 are the main

reasons for the decline in total assets and total

investment portfolio of the sector. Due to liquidity

issues faced by Entrust Securities PLC during

2015, the management of the company vested with

the National Savings Bank in January 2016 through

a direction issued by the Monetary Board of the

Central Bank.

Assets and Liabilities

The total assets of PD sector decreased by 6.4

per cent to Rs. 264.5 billion in 2016 compared to

Rs. 282.6 billion in 2015. Total investment portfolio of

government securities accounted for 84.8 per cent of the

total assets of the industry. The total investment portfolio

of government securities, consisting of trading, available

for sale and held to maturity amounted to Rs. 224.2

billion at end 2016, recording a decrease of 4.2 per cent

over 2015. This change was due to decreases in the

trading portfolio and the available for sale portfolio of

government securities. The trading portfolio decreased

to Rs. 98.1 billion by end 2016 from Rs. 132.8 billion at

end 2015 and available for sale portfolio decreased by

63.9 per cent to Rs. 19.3 billion during 2016 compared

to Rs. 53.4 billion at end 2015. Held to maturity portfolio

increased significantly by 123.7 per cent to Rs. 106.8

billion by end 2016 from Rs. 47.8 billion reported at end

2015.

Risks in PD Sector

(a) Market Risk: Market risk exposure declined

in 2016. The proportion of trading portfolio to total

investment portfolio decreased from 56.8 per cent at

end 2015 to 43.8 per cent at end 2016, reducing the

possible high market risk exposure of the sector.

(b) Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk exposure

also decreased in 2016. The overall liquidity risk

exposure of PD sector decreased due to the decline

in over-night negative mismatch in the maturity

profile of assets and liabilities of the sector by end

2016. The overnight negative mismatch decreased

significantly to Rs. 2,671.8 million or 15.7 per cent

of the total overnight liabilities at end 2016 from

Rs. 7,101.5 million or 37.2 per cent at end 2015.

In view of holding a large volume of risk free

government securities by PDs and also the ability

to use such government securities as collateral for

obtaining funds to bridge any unforeseen liquidity

gaps, the liquidity risk profile of PDs remained low

throughout the year except for a particular PD who

was facing liquidity issues since the fourth quarter

of 2015. Most of the PDs operated with stand-by

contingency funding arrangements to bridge any

liquidity gaps.

Profitability and Capital

The PDs reported a 72.6 per cent growth

in profit after tax amounting to Rs. 14.6 billion

during 2016 against that of Rs. 8.4 billion during

2015. This significant growth in PDs profit is mainly

due to an exorbitant profit recorded by one PD. The

capital gains generated from the sale of government

securities largely contributed to the increase of profits.

Consequently, ROA for the sector as a whole and

ROE for standalone PDs increased to 5.5 per cent

and 72.6 per cent, respectively, by end 2016 from 3.7

per cent and 42.7 per cent in 2015.

Equity of the PDs increased by 5.3 per cent

largely due to the enhancement of the minimum

core capital requirement from Rs. 350 million to Rs.

1,000 million. As at end December 2016, all standalone

PDs, except Entrust Securities PLC, maintained their

core capital above the minimum requirement of Rs.

1,000 million. Although the Risk Weighted Capital

Adequacy Ratio (RWCAR) of the standalone PDs was

above the minimum requirement of 10.0 per cent, the

ratio decreased to 21.7 per cent as at the end 2016

from 25.5 per cent as at the end 2015.

Market Participation

Primary Market Activities: The participation

in primary market auctions in respect of Treasury

bills and Treasury bonds by PDs has shown mixed

performance. Out of the total bids accepted from

the total Treasury bill auctions (52) conducted in

2016, the participation of Bank PDs, Standalone

PDs and EPF accounted for 66.9 per cent, 28.2

per cent and 4.9 per cent, respectively. However,

participation of Treasury bond auctions in 2016

was dominated by standalone PDs with a 50.7 per

cent share of the total bids accepted through 23

auctions conducted in 2016.

Secondary Market Activities: Secondary

market transactions in government securities

increased significantly by 36.4 per cent to Rs.

21,021.3 billion during 2016 compared to 2015,

of which, repo transactions accounted for 86.3

per cent of the total volume of secondary market

transactions in 2016. During 2016, outright

purchases and outright sales declined by 16.0 per

cent and 22.9 per cent, respectively, compared to

the values in 2015.

Unit Trusts

Number of unit trusts (UTs) increased by

3 with the launch of 4 new trusts and the

closure of one during the year. However,

new entrants in 2016 were lower than the

launch of 11 new trusts in 2015. Total number

of UTs managed by 14 unit trust management

companies increased to 77 funds by end 2016

from 74 funds by end of 2015. Out of these

funds, 74 operated as open-ended funds, 2

operated as closed-ended funds and 1 as a

dollar bond fund. The open–ended funds included

18 money market funds, 15 gilt-edged funds, 14

income funds, 8 equity growth funds, 8 balanced

funds, 5 shariah funds, 4 index funds and 2 initial

public offer (IPO) funds.

Business growth

The total assets of the UTs sector decreased

by Rs. 27.2 billion to Rs. 103.1 billion at end

2016, compared to Rs. 130.3 billion at end 2015.

The number of units issued decreased to 7,150 at

end 2016 from 8,766 at end 2015, while the total

number of unit holders increased to 41,249 at end

2016 from 38,008 reported at end 2015. The net

asset value per unit also marginally declined to

Rs. 14.42 by end 2016, compared to Rs. 14.76 by

end 2015.

Investment

The share of investment in both government

securities and equities by UTs increased

significantly in 2016. The investment in government

securities increased to Rs. 49,632 million by 68.8

per cent from Rs. 29,405 million at the end of 2015.

Further, the share of equities in the investment

portfolios of UTs increased to 13.5 per cent by end of

2016 compared to 11.1 per cent at end 2015.

Insurance Sector

The insurance sector recorded improved

performance in terms of asset growth and

earnings during the year. As at end 2016,

there were 29 insurance companies operating

in Sri Lanka registered with the IBSL. While

14 companies operated as exclusive general

insurance companies and 12 companies operated

as exclusive long-term insurance business

companies, the remaining 3 companies engaged

in both long-term insurance and general insurance

business. There were 59 companies engaged

in insurance brokering business mainly focusing

on general insurance sector. Eight insurance

companies were listed on Colombo Stock Exchange

(CSE) as at end 2016, while 5 companies operated

with foreign affiliations. Insurance penetration in

Sri Lanka, calculated based on total premium as

a percentage of GDP, slightly increased to 1.2

per cent in 2016 from 1.1 per cent in 2015 mainly

due to increase in total premium, but remained

considerably low compared to peer countries. In

2016, insurance penetration of long-term insurance

and general insurance were at 0.5 per cent and 0.6

per cent, respectively. However, insurance density

has marginally increased to Rs. 6,617 per person in

2016 from Rs. 5,768 per person in 2015.

Business Growth

Total assets of the insurance sector

expanded by 10.9 per cent to Rs. 503.1 billion

in 2016 from 453.6 billion in 2015. Both long-

term insurance and general insurance business

category contributed to this expansion. Total

assets of long-term insurance business sub-

sector increased to Rs. 334.4 billion at end 2016,

accounting for 66.5 per cent of the total assets of

the insurance sector compared to 67.3 per cent at

the end of 2015. Accordingly, the relative share of

the general insurance business sub sector slightly

increased up to 33.5 per cent of the total assets

of the insurance sector, which amounted to Rs.

168.8 billion at the end of 2016.

The growth of Gross Written Premium

(GWP) of the insurance industry decelerated to

16.0 per cent in 2016 compared to the growth

of 21.1 per cent recorded in 2015. The general

insurance sub sector accounted for 54.7 per cent

of GWP of the industry. This sub sector registered

a growth of 14.0 per cent compared to 21.9

per cent in 2015. Motor insurance activities

continued to maintain its growth momentum during

the period under consideration. The GWP for motor

insurance, increased by 15.1 per cent in 2016,

which contributed for 77.7 per cent of the total GWP

of the general insurance sub sector. GWP for long-

term insurance amounted Rs. 63.5 billion, which

grew by 18.6 per cent compared to 20.1 per cent in

the previous period. The deceleration in growth of

the GWP is partly due to significantly high premium

income recorded during the previous year.

Earnings

Total profits earned by the insurance sector

marked a 67.5 per cent growth in 2016. This

impressive growth was mainly attributable to the

performance in general insurance sector. The

higher growth rate recorded during years was

supported by higher market interest rate prevailed

in 2016. The underwriting profits increased to

Rs. 10.1 billion in 2016 compared to Rs. 8.1 billion

in 2015 and recorded a 24.9 per cent growth during

the year. Profit of long-term insurance business

grew at 24.8 per cent, while profits in the general

insurance sector grew by 125.9 per cent.

Claims of general insurance sector,

increased by 15.9 per cent to Rs. 37.7 billion,

of long-term insurance slightly improved to 2.9 per

cent in 2016 compared to 2.7 per cent in 2015. In

addition, for the long term insurance sector, the

ROE ratio decreased to 25.0 per cent form 32.4

per cent in 2015.

Capital and Investment

All general and long-term insurance

companies except one general insurance

company achieved the statutory solvency

margin requirements as at end 2016. However,

the ratio of capital to total assets decreased to 52.0

per cent at end of 2016 from 55.0 per cent at end

of 2015 in the general insurance sector, while the

ratio declined to 12.0 per cent from 15.0 per cent in

long-term sub sector. When the breakup of

investments portfolio of insurance sector is

considered, 48.0 per cent of long-term insurance

assets and 17.9 per cent of general insurance

assets were invested in government securities as

at end 2016. The relative share of equity in the

total investment of long-term insurance declined to

7.9 per cent in 2016 from 10.8 per cent in 2015.

Meanwhile, the share of equity in total investment

of general insurance sector, improved to 23.6 per

cent from 22.3 per cent recorded in the previous

year. Investments in corporate debt securities

accounted for 11.2 per cent of the total investments

of general insurance at end 2016, compared

to a share of 8.8 per cent in 2015. Meanwhile,

investments in corporate debt securities by the

long-term insurance sector increased to 23.0 per

cent at end 2016 from 18.5 per cent in 2015.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

In 2016, the IBSL adopted several regulatory

measures and issued guidelines with the aim of

promoting professionalism and enhancing the

reputation of the industry, while safeguarding

the interests of the policyholders. Accordingly,

IBSL issued a Direction to all insurers and insurance

brokers to obtain the written approval from IBSL

on changes in ownership or control over 50 per

cent of issued shares or financial instruments with

voting rights when converted would amount to 50

per cent or more of issued share capital. Further,

long-term insurance companies were directed

to grant policyholders a cooling-off period (free-

look period) of 21 days to examine the terms

and conditions of the policy documents. This will

provide the policyholder an opportunity to terminate

the policy during this period and the insurer is

liable to refund the initial deposits or premium paid

by the prospective policyholder. IBSL also issued

a Circular requiring all insurance companies to

inform IBSL about new insurance products along

with the launch date of such products. Accordingly,

all general insurance companies are required to

submit relevant documents prior to the launch whilst

long-term insurance companies need to submit

actuarial certificate, policy document and proposal form

at least 45 days prior to the launch. In addition, IBSL

issued several guidelines with the view of enhancing

the quality and image of the industry. Accordingly, a

set of Guidelines on Complaints Handling by insurers

and brokers was issued in October 2016 with the

objective of ensuring that processes are in place for

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

timely and fair handling of complaints by insurers and

brokers. Further, IBSL amended the Guidelines on

Linked Long-Term Insurance Business.

Superannuation Funds

In 2016, total assets of the superannuation

funds sector recorded a growth of 12.4

per cent to Rs. 2,537.2 billion compared to

Rs. 2,257.5 billion in 2015. This sector comprised

of the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), the

Employees’ Trust Fund and the Public Service

Provident Fund managed by government

institutions and 152 privately managed Approved

Pension and Provident Funds. Assets of this sector

contributed for 16.5 per cent of the total financial

sector assets by end 2016 in comparison to 16.3

per cent reported in 2015.

Employees’ Provident Fund

As per the Employees’ Provident Fund Act.

No. 15 of 1958 (EPF Act), the Monetary Board

of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is entrusted

with the custodianship of EPF, while the

Commissioner of Labour is entrusted with the

general administration of the Fund. The EPF

Department of the Central Bank facilitates the

Monetary Board to perform its custodian powers,

duties and functions as per the provisions of the

EPF Act.

Membership, Member Balances and Refunds:

Total value of the Fund increased by 10.6 per cent

or Rs. 176.6 billion to Rs. 1,841.5 billion at end 2016

compared to Rs. 1,664.9 billion recorded by end

2015. This increase was due to the combined effect

of the net contributions of the members (contributions

less refund payments) and the income generated

through the effective and prudent investment of

the Fund. Total liability to the members including

member interest stood at Rs. 1,810.6 billion as at end

2016 recording an 11.4 per cent increase from Rs.

1,625.5 billion as at end 2015. The total contribution

for the year 2016 increased by 15.4 per cent to Rs.

118.3 billion. The total amount of refunds made to

the members and their legal heirs in 2016 was Rs.

108.4 billion, which was an increase of 39.3 per cent

over 2015 mainly due to increased payments made

under the 30 per cent withdrawal facility for members.

Accordingly, the net contribution was only Rs. 9.9

billion compared to Rs. 24.7 billion recorded in the

previous year. The net income of the Fund increased

by 12.1 per cent to Rs. 175.9 billion in 2016 compared

to Rs. 156.9 billion recorded in the previous year.

Investment Portfolio: The total investment

portfolio (book value) of the Fund grew by 10.5

per cent to Rs. 1,772.2 billion in 2016 from Rs.

1,604.2 billion in 2015. The investment policy of

the Fund focused on providing a long-term positive

real rate of return to the members while ensuring

the safety of the Fund and availability of sufficient

level of liquidity to meet refund payments and other

expenses of the Fund. Accordingly, as at end 2016

the investment portfolio consisted of 93.1 per cent

investments in government securities, 4.6 per cent in

equity and 2.1 per cent in corporate debentures. The

remaining 0.2 per cent was invested in highly liquid

assets such as reverse repos backed by government

securities to maintain day to day liquidity requirements

and overnight repos or standing deposit facilities with

the Domestic Operations Department of the Central

Bank.

Investment Income: The total investment income

of the Fund amounted to Rs. 192.9 billion in 2016,

recording an increase of 12.5 per cent compared to

the previous year. Interest income continued to be the

major source of income of the Fund accounting for

85.8 per cent of the income and grew by 15.7 per cent

to Rs. 165.5 billion in 2016 from Rs. 143.1 billion in

2015. Due to adverse market conditions, capital gains

from government securities decreased to Rs. 0.6

billion in 2016 from Rs. 1.2 billion in 2015, whereas

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

capital gains from equity investments decreased to

Rs. 0.5 billion from Rs. 0.6 billion. However, dividend

income increased by 21.4 per cent to Rs. 4.3 billion

in 2016.

Overall Return of the Fund: The Fund earned

a total gross income of Rs. 193.1 billion in 2016,

recording an increase of 12.3 per cent compared to

the previous year. EPF was able to pay an interest

rate of 10.5 per cent on member balances, while

maintaining operating expenses to income ratio

around 0.69 per cent in 2015 and 0.77 per cent in

2016.

Employees’ Trust Fund

Employees Trust Fund (ETF) is the

second largest superannuation fund which

accounts for 9.8 per cent of the total assets

of the superannuation funds sector. ETF is

the employer contributory retirement scheme

administrated by the Employees’ Trust Fund Board of

the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs.

During the year, the Fund continued to expand at a

somewhat similar growth to that recorded in 2015 with

respect to assets, income and investment. ETF held

about 12.5 million accounts with 2.5 million accounts

remaining active. The total outstanding member

balances of ETF increased by 12.4 per cent to Rs.

225.3 billion by end 2016 from Rs. 200.5 billion at end

2015. During the year, total contributions of the Fund

increased to Rs. 20.3 billion from Rs. 18.1 billion in

the previous year enabling a net positive contribution

to the Fund, after paying Rs. 13.5 billion as member

benefits in 2016. Total investment portfolio of ETF

rose by 11.9 per cent to Rs. 235.7 billion at end

2016 and government securities account for 84.8 per

cent of these investment. Investments in equity and

corporate fixed income securities accounted for 5.2

per cent and 0.9 per cent, respectively, of the total

investments. The effective rate of return on member

balances of ETF showed a marginal decline to 9.1 per

cent in 2016 in comparison to 9.3 per cent in 2015.

Other Superannuation Funds

Other superannuation funds consist of Public

Service Provident Fund (PSPF) and Approved

Pension and Provident Funds (APPFs). The

active member accounts of the PSPF decreased

to 232,135 accounts at end 2016 from 232,793 in

2015. Total contributions to the PSPF, decreased

by 40.8 per cent to Rs. 1,463.3 million in 2016 from

Rs. 2,469.9 million in 2015 due to the absorption of

employees who worked in government institutions

on contract basis to their permanent carder. Total

refunds made by the Fund to its members in 2016

decreased by 24.5 per cent to Rs. 554.0 million.

Accordingly, the net contributions to the Fund also

decreased by 47.6 per cent to Rs. 909.3 million

in 2016 compared to Rs. 1,735.8 million in 2015.

However, total assets of PSPF increased by 3.4

per cent to Rs. 47.7 billion at end 2016 from Rs.

46.1 billion at end 2015. Government securities

accounted for 99.8 per cent of total investments

of the Fund at end 2016. Apart from PSPF, there

were 152 privately managed Approved Provident

and Pension Funds monitored by the Department

of Labouras at end 2016. The total membership

of these privately managed funds was 160,130

persons at the end of 2016. Total assets and total

2016.

8.4 Performance of Financial Markets

Money Market

Excess rupee liquidity in the domestic money

market, which remained high in the latter part of

December 2015, declined gradually and turned

to a deficit towards the end of the first quarter

of 2016. Excess liquidity remained high in the early

part of 2016, mainly due to Central Bank purchasing

Treasury bills in the primary market and providing

provisional advances to the government. Excess

liquidity was absorbed during this period on a

temporary basis by way of short-term and long-

term repo auctions as well as on a permanent

basis by way of outright sales of Treasury bills. In

addition, the Central Bank increased the Statutory

Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable to all rupee

deposit liabilities of commercial banks by 1.50

percentage points to 7.50 per cent with effect from

16 January 2016, which resulted in a permanent

absorption of liquidity amounting to Rs. 52 billion

from the domestic money market. Further, foreign

exchange related transactions of the Central Bank,

including foreign loan repayments on behalf of the

government, also contributed to the gradual decline

in excess liquidity in the domestic money market.

The average excess liquidity in the domestic money

market which stood at Rs. 71.1 billion in January,

declined to around Rs. 8.6 billion in March 2016.

Thereafter, except for a few days in November and

the latter part of December 2016, market liquidity,

in general, continued to remain in deficit levels,

reflecting the combined impact of the maturing of

Treasury bills held by the Central Bank as well as

foreign currency related transactions of the Central

Bank. The deficit in liquidity in the domestic money

market, on a daily basis, during the period from

April to November 2016 averaged to Rs. 23.4

billion. From mid-December 2016, market liquidity

was in surplus, mainly due to occasional purchases

of Treasury bills and foreign exchange related

transactions of the Central Bank and foreign loan

disbursements and by end December 2016, excess

market liquidity amounted to Rs. 39.2 billion.

The average weighted call money rate

(AWCMR) displayed an increasing trend during

the first quarter of 2016 due to the increase in

policy interest rates of the Central Bank, by 50

basis points in February 2016 as well as the

gradual decline in market liquidity. The AWCMR

increased to 7.51 per cent by 24 February 2016

from 6.40 per cent at end 2015 and thereafter, it

increased rapidly towards the upper bound of the

standing rate corridor, breaching the upper bound

of the standing rate corridor by end March as a

result of the distortion created by the tax applicable

to interest income from secondary market

transactions in government securities. It was

hovering around 8.20 per cent immediately prior

to the Central Bank increasing the policy rates, i.e.

standing deposit facility rate (SDFR) and standing

lending facility rate (SLFR) to 7.00 per cent and

8.50 per cent, respectively, to be effective from

28 July 2016. Compared to the significantly large

adjustment in the AWCMR following the policy rate

revision in February 2016, the adjustment in the

AWCMR consequent to the policy rate revision in

July 2016 was much lower. While remaining within

the standing rate corridor from end July 2016, the

AWCMR was at 8.42 per cent at end 2016.

A few banks resorted to borrowing

persistently in the call market during the year. In

terms of the volume distribution of call transactions,

around 66 per cent of the total borrowing was

accounted for by three banks which borrowed most,

whilst around 52 per cent of the total lending was

done by three banks which lent the most. In terms

of the frequency of resorting to the call market (total

number of trading days in the call money market by

all banks), four banks which resorted to borrowing

in the call market the most number of days were

active on 47 per cent of the total number of days

of such borrowing. Further, three banks which lent

on the most number of days in the call market were

active on 30 per cent of the total number of days on

which banks had lent. Some primary dealers (PDs)

borrowed continuously from the Central Bank at

the reverse repo auctions at rates at or close to

the SLFR whereas the average weighted repo rate

(AWRR) in the repo market remained lower than

the SLFR. This was mainly due to the counterparty

lending limits imposed by the lenders in view of the risk

associated with such secondary market transactions.

Meanwhile, some LCBs and PDs continued to run

short positions for a relatively long period, possibly

due to their investments, or granting of credit without

a corresponding increase in deposits in the case of

banks.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

Amidst high demand in the domestic foreign

exchange market, Sri Lankan rupee continued to

depreciate against the US dollar during 2016. Sri

Lankan rupee depreciated by 3.83 per cent against

US dollar from Rs. 144.06 as at end December 2015

to Rs. 149.80 as at end December 2016. Depreciation

of USD/LKR exchange rate in 2016 was relatively low

compared to the depreciation of 9.03 per cent recorded

during 2015. The capital outflows including the repatriation

of foreign investments held in government securities

parallel to the expectations of an interest rate hike by the

Federal Reserve as well as the higher demand for foreign

exchange emanated from import bills exerted pressure on

the exchange rate to depreciate during the year. In line with

the overall depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the

US dollar, the average US dollar buying and selling rates

of commercial banks for telegraphic transfers as of end

2016 were recorded at Rs. 147.84 and Rs. 151.66, whilst

comparative figures as of end 2015 were Rs. 141.94 and

Rs. 146.18, respectively. During the year, Sri Lankan rupee

depreciated against other major currencies such as, euro,

Japanese yen and Indian rupee by 0.32 per cent, 7.05 per

cent and 1.72 per cent, respectively. On the contrary, Sri

Lankan rupee appreciated against Pound sterling by 16.04

per cent during 2016, attributed mainly to the depreciation

of Pound sterling against major currencies consequent to

the decision by British electorate to leave the European

Union in June 2016.

During 2016, trading volumes in the domestic

foreign exchange market increased by 8.66 per

cent compared to the previous year. Transaction

volumes of foreign exchange in the domestic inter-

bank market increased to US dollars 14,769.50

million in 2016 from US dollars 13,592.48 million

in 2015. Accordingly, the daily average volume in

the inter-bank foreign exchange market recorded

a similar increase, amounting to US dollars 61.03

million in 2016 in comparison to US dollars 56.64

million in 2015.

In order to curb the excess volatility in the

exchange rate, Central Bank intervened by selling

foreign exchange in the domestic market in 2016.

During the year, Central Bank purchased US dollars

1,132.22 million, while injected US dollars 1,900.38

million. Accordingly, the Central Bank supplied US

dollars 768.16 million on net basis to the domestic

foreign exchange market in 2016.

Government Securities Market

The Treasury bill yield rates which showed

an increasing trend in January 2016 continued

in February 2016 responding to the increase in

policy rates by 50 basis points in February 2016.

However, the increasing trend moderated by end

April 2016 and remained broadly stable thereafter till

end July 2016. In July 2016, the Central Bank further

tightened its monetary policy stance by increasing

the policy rates by 50 basis points. Accordingly,

Treasury bill rates showed an upward adjustment

and remained at elevated levels till end August 2016.

However, from September 2016, Treasury bill yield

rates decreased marginally and remained broadly

stable thereafter till end 2016. The debt management

strategy adopted to lowering cost of borrowing was

supported by borrowings from international capital

markets. Accordingly, International Sovereign Bonds

were issued in July 2016 amounting to US dollars

1,500 million and this helped to ease the pressure on

interest rates in the domestic market. Despite these

efforts, foreign holdings of Treasury bills and Treasury

bonds declined during the latter part of 2016, mainly

due to increase in US policy rates, which resulted in

capital outflows from emerging markets. Adjustments

in the sovereign ratings during the year also resulted

in a less appealing investment landscape. As a result

of foreign outflows and due to the increased SRR by

the Central Bank, the benchmark yield rate on 364

day Treasury bills recorded an increase of 287 basis

points by end 2016 from that of end 2015. Treasury bill

rates for 91 day, 182 day and 364 day maturities as at

end December 2016 stood at 8.72 per cent, 9.63 per cent

and 10.17 per cent, respectively. The upward movement

in short-term interest rates have pushed, Treasury bond

yields to an upward trajectory towards end 2016.

The foreign investor preference for Treasury

bills and bonds has declined somewhat

considerably during 2016. Treasury bill and bond

holdings by foreign investors amounted to Rs.

260.03 billion as at end December 2016. With the

announcement of Budget 2016, the government

revised the exposure on government securities for

non-residents from 12.5 per cent to 10.0 per cent

of the total outstanding stock of Treasury bills and

bonds, with the objective of mitigating the undue

strain on reserves with the sudden withdrawal of

funds by non-residents.

With the policy decision to bring down

the domestic foreign currency denominated

debt in the medium-term plan, only US

dollars 1,365.88 million worth of Sri Lanka

Development Bonds (SLDBs) were raised

against the maturing amount of US dollars

2,186.19 million during 2016. Funds raised

through International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs)

and syndicated loans were utilised to payback

the maturing SLDBs. Further, the proceeds

of these foreign loans eased the quantity of

rupee denominated securities required to

finance the government borrowing programme

enabling to stabilise the interest rates in the

domestic market.

During 2016, the average time to maturity

of the overall domestic public debt portfolio

decreased to 5.98 years compared to 6.28

years recorded at the end of the previous

year. The average time to maturity of outstanding

Treasury bond portfolio at end December 2016

decreased to 7.07 years from 7.35 years at end

December 2015.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

The market for commercial papers (CPs)

was less active in 2016 compared to 2015. Total

value of CPs issued in 2016, decreased to Rs. 7.0

billion from Rs. 7.9 billion in 2015. The interest

rates applied to CPs varied in a range of 8.7 per

cent - 14.8 per cent in 2016 in comparison to a

range of 7.0 per cent - 12.0 per cent in 2015. CPs

with a maturity up to 3 months accounted for 42.9

per cent of total new issuances, while the share of

CPs with a maturity between greater than 3 months

and 6 months was 30.0 per cent. The remainder

was the CPs with a maturity greater than 6 months

but less than 12 months. Total outstanding value

of CPs amounted to Rs. 2.2 billion by end of 2016

compared to Rs. 4.5 billion in 2015.

The market for debentures recorded a slight

decline in 2016. CSE recorded 17 debenture

issuances by 14 companies during 2016 and

raised about Rs. 78.0 billion compared to Rs.

83.4 billion through 25 debenture issuances in

2015. The highest listed corporate debt issuance

in 2016 amounting to Rs. 8.0 billion was recorded

by People’s Leasing & Finance PLC. In addition,

Hatton National Bank PLC, Commercial Bank

of Ceylon PLC and DFCC Bank PLC issued

debentures worth Rs. 7.0 billion each.

Colombo Stock Market

Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recorded a dismal

performance in 2016 for the second consecutive

year. All Share Price Index (ASPI) declined by 9.7 per

cent to 6,228.3 points and S&P SL20 Index declined by

3.6 per cent to 3,496.4 points at end 2016 compared to

6,894.5 and 3,625.7, respectively, at end 2015. The

upward trend in interest rates in both domestic and

international markets and the depreciation of the Sri

Lankan rupee were amongst the factors that affected

negatively to the performance of CSE. As a result,

price indices pertaining to main sub sectors, namely

banks, finance and insurance, diversified holdings,

hotels and travels and telecommunication declined

substantially by 7.7 per cent, 16.4 per cent, 7.4 per

cent and 12.5 per cent, respectively, during the year.

Meanwhile, cumulative foreign purchases amounted

to Rs. 74.6 billion, while cumulative foreign sales

were Rs. 74.2 billion, resulteding in a marginal net

inflow to the market in 2016.

The primary market remained active

during the year. In 2016, Rs. 82.4 billion was

raised through 20 Initial Public Offerings (IPOs),

both equity and debt, 6 right issues and 1 new

introduction.

During 2016, the Securities and Exchange

Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) and CSE have

taken a number of regulatory measures to

develop the equity market. Revising Minimum

Public Float requirements with a view to providing

more options for listed companies to comply with

the rules pertaining to Minimum Public Float, and

implementation of Risk Based Capital Adequacy

requirement to the licensed stock brokers, are

amongst the key measures implemented during

the year.

8.5 Development Finance and Access to Finance

The Central Bank continued to execute

many concessionary development lending

programmes through Participating Financial

Institutions (PFIs). These programmes were

expected to enhance access to finance and

financial inclusion and to achieve inclusive and

equitable regional development in the country.

Under these schemes, refinance facilities, credit

guarantees and/or interest subsidies and credit

supplementary services were provided targeting

the development of the Agriculture, Livestock and

Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprise (MSME)

sectors. From a policy perspective, a number of

new policy measures were taken to ensure effective

functioning of the credit delivery mechanism in

2016. Loans totalling Rs. 20,809.1 million were

disbursed among 136,503 beneficiaries through

13 credit schemes by the Central Bank during the

year. Of the total lending, 46.4 per cent was directed

towards the Agriculture and Livestock Sector, while

MSME and Microfinance sectors received 40.6

per cent and 13.0 per cent of total disbursements,

respectively.

The Agriculture and Livestock Sector

continued to dominate in receiving a greater

proportion of concessionary credit facilities

provided by the Central Bank. These loans

were channeled through a host of loan schemes,

i.e. the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme

(NCRCS), Commercial Scale Dairy Development

Loan Scheme (CSDDLS) and Tea Development

Programme Revolving Fund (TDP-RF). Under

these schemes, total loans amounting to Rs. 9,660.5

million were disbursed among 89,730 farmers in the

relevant sectors. Of the total disbursements, 82.9

per cent were delivered through the NCRCS, which

is the principal scheme that provides both interest

subsidy and credit guarantee for loans granted by

PFIs to meet working capital requirements of the

small scale farmers for 33 short-term crop varieties.

This scheme alone contributed to 63.8 per cent of

loans granted to the Agriculture Sector.

The disbursements of loans under NCRCS

increased significantly in 2016 mainly due

to the favorable weather condition prevailed

in Maha Season in major cultivation areas.

Compared to 2015, loans granted through NCRCS

in 2016 increased by 12.2 per cent. Following the

usual pattern, the Anuradhapura District received

the highest (17 per cent) amount of loans disbursed

under the Scheme among all districts, followed by

Pollonnaruwa (13 per cent), and Ampara (10 per

cent) districts. Paddy being the major crop, received

the highest share (63 per cent) of total loans

disbursed under NCRCS. In order to facilitate the

national policy for the development of sugar industry

that targeted achieving 50 per cent self-sufficiency

in 2020, the Central Bank in 2016 included “Sugar

Cane” also as an eligible crop under the NCRCS

enabling provision of concessionary credit to the

suger cane growers.

Loans disbursements under CSDDLS

increased significantly by 32.8 per cent in

2016 compared to the previous year. Under this

scheme, loans amounting to Rs. 1,633.5 million

were granted by PFIs among 2,667 dairy farmers

and among dairy entrepreneurs for the dairy related

activities covering farm development, processing,

transportation, storing and marketing. Since the

gestation period of the most of dairy related activities

are relatively longer than 6 months, the Central

Bank on the basis of the requests made by dairy

farmers and the PFIs on behalf of their customers,

increased the maximum grace period of the

CSDDLS from 06 months to 12 months depending

on the requirements of the respective projects. This

measure allows sufficient time period for the dairy

investors to generate positive cash flow to meet

their payment obligations under the Loan Scheme.

In addition, the maximum repayment period for

the loans granted under the CSDDLS, was also

increased from 5 years to 6 years, inclusive of a

maximum grace period of 01 year with effect from

06 February 2017. In the performance perspective,

total amount of loans granted under NCRCS and

CSDDLS increased by 15.3 per cent in 2016.

With the intention of addressing emerging

and changing needs of intermediary financial

service providers, the Central Bank initiated

actions to introduce the Partial Credit

Guarantee Scheme (PCG) under the proposed

Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project

(AMP) funded by the World Bank. The PCG was

introduced as an innovative risk sharing tool under

the AMP, which operates with the objectives of

supporting agriculture productivity and efficiency,

Economic activities exert externalities on the natural environment. Increased attention to negative environmental effects has created a widespread discussion on achieving sustainable economic development, which broadly refers to development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Accordingly, sustainable development indicates the need to preserve the ability of natural systems to provide natural resources and ecosystem services for future economic activity, in the process of economic development.

Financial institutions, particularly banks, play a significant role in promoting growth and development through supporting the activities of economic agents, which also have implications on the environment. Nevertheless, for a considerable period, financial institutions did not focus on issues related to the environment, which are affected by economic activities funded by the financial institutions. This situation has changed over time as financial institutions have shown an increased interest in incorporating environmental concerns and issues into their business decisions and thereby have increased their participation in promoting sustainable development. In particular, there is growing awareness in the financial sector that the natural environment brings risks as well as opportunities for financial institutions, and hence green or sustainable financing policies have been developed in the recent decades (Jeucken, 2001).

With the implementation of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)1 and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, governments and businesses around the world are taking important initiatives to develop sustainable financial systems to facilitate sustainable development. The G20 also highlighted sustainable finance as a global priority and formed the Green Finance Study Group with the aim of enhancing mobilisation of sustainable finance through financial markets.

Sustainable Finance and Its Significance

As defined in the G20 Green Finance Synthesis Report of Green Finance Study Group, sustainable finance can be described as the financing of investments that provide benefits in the broader context of environmentally sustainable development. These environmental benefits include, reductions in air, water and land pollution, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, improved energy efficiency as well as mitigation of, and adaptation to climate change and their co-benefits. As such, sustainable finance refers to financial services and products integrating environmental, social

BOX 12Promoting Sustainable Finance for Sustainable Development

and governance criteria into business or investment decisions to obtain lasting benefits for the society. In a broader context, sustainable finance reflects a blend of two factors: (i) Risk management: screening and managing environmental and social risks as a part of financial institutions’ decision making process to avoid or mitigate financial losses, reputational risk or harm to the environment and people, and (ii) Loan origination: supporting lending to businesses that are environmentally friendly and socially responsible in line with the global commitment to increase funding for climate change solutions.

It is observed that by effectively managing environmental and social risks and identifying opportunities alongside these risks, financial institutions, especially banks, can create long-term value for their businesses by adopting sustainable finance practices. In order to realise the commercial dimension of sustainable development, financial institutions, especially banks, will need to introduce new financial services and products, which can be more valuable and less risky for the bank and yield socially responsible investment in economic activity. Hence, banks can initiate and develop sustainable finance by introducing a wide range of financial products, asset classes and instruments, including green loans, green bonds and green investment funds for project financing.

International Experiences in Sustainable Finance

Banks in the United States were the first to consider environmental policies in order to comply with certain regulations that made banks directly responsible for environmental pollution and even imposed remediation costs for non-compliance (Jeucken, 2001). However, European banks were not exposed to such liabilities and they only began to develop policies in relation to environmental issues during the mid-1990s leading to the development of new products, such as environmentally friendly investment funds.

Since the launch of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Statement by Financial Institutions on the Environment and Sustainable Development, in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, there has been a clear direction towards environmentally friendly finance. According to Jeucken (2001), a survey among the signatories of the UNEP Statement concluded that many banks have setup environmental departments and are developing environmentally friendly financial products. Moreover, with the influence of multilateral development agencies such as the World Bank, there has been a shift towards environmental standards, as the financial community adopted measures such as the ‘Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index (1999)‘ and the ‘FTSE4Good Index (2001)’ with a view to tracking the performance of sustainability driven corporates. 1. See Box Article No. 6 of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2015 for a detailed discussion on SDGs.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Since the late 2000s, the concept of sustainable finance was increasingly adopted by many countries by launching country specific national policies or road maps to align their financial systems to facilitate sustainable development. For example, the United Kingdom created a Green Investment Bank (GIB) in 2012 aiming to mobilise investments in innovative, environmentally-friendly areas. South Korea also introduced a Framework on Low Carbon Green Growth and a five year plan to implement a green growth strategy covering green financing with the intention of promoting a carbon-trading system and infrastructure for green finance. While the Asia Pacific region remains the most active region for sustainable finance, sustainable banking initiatives became popular across multiple emerging markets. As such, a number of emerging economies have launched sustainable finance policies, guidelines, and road maps for banks to strengthen environmental and social-risk management and innovate green investment.

In emerging markets, the Sustainable Banking Network (SBN), supported by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), is providing guidance to advance sustainable finance through knowledge sharing, capacity building and providing support to develop national enabling frameworks. SBN is a community of financial sector regulatory agencies and banking associations from emerging markets committed to advancing sustainable finance in line with international best practices. It facilitates collective learning of members, and supports them in policy development and related initiatives to create drivers for sustainable finance in their home countries. The idea for SBN emerged during the first International Green Credit Forum hosted by the IFC and the China Banking Regulatory Commission, in Beijing, in May 2012, where banking regulators and associations from 10 countries requested that IFC facilitate a global knowledge network on sustainable banking. The Network was formally launched in September 2012. Among SBN members, the Bangladesh Bank introduced environmental risk management guidelines and policy guidelines for green banking, in 2011, to address policy and governance of green banking. China introduced ‘Green Credit Guidelines’ in 2012 for banks to consider environmental impact and energy efficiency as a part of lending decisions and to implement green banking. In 2015, China also introduced green credit key performance indicators to strengthen, monitor and evaluate green banking. Indonesia also launched a road map for sustainable finance in 2014 to contribute to the national commitment to address climate change including mitigation, adaptation, and the transition to a competitive low carbon economy. The Reserve Bank of India embarked on promoting

sustainable development and non-financial reporting in 2007, followed by the India Bankers’ Association launching the responsible financing principles in 2017, while the State Bank of Pakistan is also in the process of launching green banking guidelines in 2017. IFC provides strategic and technical advisory services to support the development of these country specific policies/guidelines and to harmonise them with international good practices.

Promoting Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka and the Way Forward

With the implementation of the Sustainable Development Agenda, Sri Lanka has identified several development priorities including environmental sustainability and promoting green business. Towards the achievement of this goal, Sri Lanka has already launched initiatives such as the Blue-Green Development Strategy in line with the Blue-Green economy concept of the UNEP, which addresses environmental concerns, while fulfilling the relevant SDGs towards sustainable and resilient development.

For the process of achieving such priorities and development challenges, a responsible and inclusive financial system can play a vital role in Sri Lanka. In particular, since the Sri Lankan financial system is predominantly driven by banks, they need to take an initiative towards sustainable finance as a part of broader strategies for sustainable banking. Further, by providing green loans, banks can contribute to, and benefit from environmentally sound projects. As environmental risks associated with economic activities entail financial risks for the financial institutions, banks can formulate their policies or make efforts to shift the preferences of their customers towards activities that would ensure sustainability.

Though sustainable finance is being popularised across many financial and banking markets, the development of sustainable finance still faces many challenges such as, (a) Externalities: how to internalise environmental externalities appropriately and cost-effectively; (b) Maturity mismatch: due to inadequate supply of long-term funding relative to the demand for funding by long-term projects; (c) Lack of clarity in sustainable finance: identifying what constitutes sustainable finance activities and products can be an obstacle; (d) Asymmetric information: lack of disclosure of environmental information; and (e) Inadequate analytical capabilities: little understanding and lack of capacity of the financial implications of environmental risks by financial institutions (G20 Green Finance Synthesis Report). These challenges, which are valid for the Sri Lankan context can be

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

overcome by improved knowledge sharing, capacity building, stronger and clearer policy directives, and clarity in defining of sustainable finance activities.

With the leadership of the Sri Lanka Banks’ Association (Guarantee) Ltd (SLBA), a number of banks in Sri Lanka have already adopted a set of voluntary principles on sustainable banking. These principles cover the areas of environmental and social risk management, environmental and social footprint, rights of the respective stakeholders, financial inclusion, environmental and social governance, promotion of ethical finance, promotion of ‘green economy’ growth, capacity building, collaborative partnerships, promotion of transparency and accountability, and refraining from ‘racing to the bottom’(not competing with other banks on environmental and social issues) to operationalise the sustainable finance concept in Sri Lanka. These principles are expected to enhance innovation, competitiveness and the quality of bank credit, while helping society to address sustainability challenges such as social inequity, climate change, resource scarcity and environmental damage.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is also making an effort to expand these initiatives with the support of stakeholders and is guiding financial institutions to effectively manage environmental and social risks in the projects that they finance and promote businesses that are greener and climate friendly. For this purpose, a roadmap is being formulated with the support of key stakeholders, which will provide guidance and support to Sri Lankan financial institutions in expanding engagement in sustainable finance, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of the Sri Lankan economy.

Lending to the MSME sector continued to

gain priority in 2016. The Central Bank provided

concessionary credit to the MSME sector focusing

on sustainable economic growth, employment

generation, poverty eradication, etc. through 5 credit

schemes namely, the Saubagya Loan Scheme

(SLS), Small Holder Plantation Entrepreneurship

Development Programme (SPEnDP), Dry Zone

Livelihood Support and Partnership Programme –

Revolving Fund (DZLiSPP-RF), Self-Employment

Promotion Initiative Loan Scheme – Phase II (SEPI-

ph-II) and Working Capital Loan Scheme for Tea

Factories (WCLSTF). These schemes together

disbursed loans totaling to Rs. 8,447.2 million among

13,810 beneficiaries 2016. Of all these schemes, the

SLS which is operated island-wide as the flagship

loan scheme that provides loans to the MSME sector,

alone disbursed Rs. 4,767.1 million or 56.4 per cent

of the loans disbursed to the MSME sector. The

WCLSTF, which was introduced in August 2015,

disbursed Rs. 3,539.8 million of short-term working

capital loans among 115 registered tea factory owners

who were eligible under the Scheme. It accounted for

a sizable portion of 41.9 per cent of loans granted to

the SME sector in 2016. Further, SPEnDP, DZLiSPP

and SEPI-ph-II disbursed a total of Rs. 140.2 million

among 677 borrowers. Total disbursements made

under these schemes in 2016, excluding that of

WCLSTF, increased by 42.5 per cent compared to

the amount disbursed in 2015.

The Central Bank has taken a number of

new policy measures to strengthen the effective

credit delivery to the development of the MSME

sector. These measures include implementation

of Phase II of the Self-Employment Promotion

Initiative Loan Scheme (SEPI-ph-II), on behalf

of the government. This Scheme will continue to

recommenced to disburse Rs. 90 million funded by

the International Fund for Agricultural Development

(IFAD) by targeting the micro level entrepreneurs

who were engaged in income generating activities

at micro level in the industries, agriculture,

livestock, fisheries trade and other services. In

response to the requests made by individuals to

grant loans of less than Rs. 30,000, the lower band

of the loan limit was reduced to Rs. 10,000 under

this scheme in 2016. Thus, with this amendment

now, beneficiaries are able to obtain loans ranging

from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 300,000. In addition, a

new loan scheme named, “Tharuna Diriya” Youth

Empowerment and Employment Project under

the NADeP was introduced in 2016 to assist the

rural youth to improve their livelihood by providing

credit facilities and required training to establish

small scale enterprises. Accordingly, the operating

instructions pertaining to this loan scheme were

issued to PFIs during the year. In addition, the

‘Value Chain Development Capital Agriculture

Loan Scheme’ and ‘Value Chain Development

Seasonal Agriculture Loan Scheme’ were also

implemented under the ‘Out-Grower Farmers Loan

Scheme’ of NADeP, targeting an increase in the

production, productivity, quality and value addition

of agriculture produce.

The Central Bank continued to promote

financial literacy, financial inclusiveness

and entrepreneurship development through

a number of programmes and workshops,

covering various areas of financial literacy,

financial management, entrepreneurship

development, Training of Trainers (TOT) and

project appraisal workshops for entrepreneurs.

Accordingly, the Central Bank conducted 172

awareness programmes in 2016 to educate

beneficiaries and other stakeholders. In addition,

financial support for both new entrants and existing

entrepreneurs who engage in income generating

activities in the Agriculture and Livestock, Industrial

and Services sectors at village level.

Lending to the Microfinance sector was

continued in 2016 with a view to broadening

the financial outreach among the masses and

promoting poverty alleviation in the country. In

order to achieve this objective, the Central Bank

operated five microfinance loan schemes, namely,

Poverty Alleviation Micro-Finance Project II-

Revolving Fund (PAMP II-RF), Poverty Alleviation

Micro-Finance Project - Revolving Fund (PAMP-

RF), Small Farmers and Landless Credit Project-

Revolving Fund (SFLCP-RF), Microfinance Loan

Scheme and “Tharuna Diriya” Loan Scheme

under the National Agribusiness Development

Programme (NADeP). Through these schemes,

loans amounting to Rs. 2,701.4 million were

disbursed among 32,963 beneficiaries during

2016. These schemes mainly targeted the micro

level entrepreneurs who were engaged in income

generating activities pertaining to industries,

agriculture, livestock, fisheries trade and other

services in the country. Overall, loans disbursed

under the microfinance loan schemes implemented

by the Central Bank, increased by 31.6 per cent in

2016 compared that in the previous year.

The Central Bank has taken a number of

initiatives to enhance the access to finance of

the microfinance sector. In January 2016, the

Microfinance Component of National Agribusiness

solidarity groups called Self Help Groups with a

view to empowering grass root level entrepreneurs

to cross pass poverty.

The Central Bank also conducted the first-

ever island-wide field survey in Sri Lanka

to collect demand side information on the

financial inclusiveness. The information gathered

under this survey will provide baseline information

to measure the level of financial inclusion of the

country paving the way to developing a National

Strategy for Financial Inclusion for Sri Lanka.

8.6 Financial Infrastructure

Payment & Settlement Systems

In 2016, the Central Bank continued to

regulate and supervise the national payment

and settlement systems in order to ensure

an efficient and secure national payment

infrastructure to facilitate economic activities

of the country. Accordingly, the Central Bank

strengthened its oversight activities and initiated

action to introduce regulatory measures to address

risk associated with innovative payment means

with the view of promoting new developments. In

addition, during 2016, the Central Bank ensured

that the large value and retail payment systems

operated smoothly catering to individual and

institutional payment needs.

During the year under review, the Real

Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System and

the LankaSecure System, which are the two

main components of the LankaSettle System

operated smoothly to accommodate increasing

transaction volumes. The RTGS System, which

settles interbank high value and time critical Sri

Lanka rupee transactions on a real time basis,

settled 365,991 payment transactions amounting

to Rs. 93,378 billion in 2016. The RTGS System

accounted for 88 per cent of the total value of

non-cash payments and continued to be the main

interbank funds transfer system in the country. In

order to address liquidity issues of the participating

institutions, the Central Bank as the operator

of the system, continued to provide the interest

free Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF) against the

collateral of government securities. During the

year, participating institutions utilised ILF of Rs.

9.2 trillion recording an average value of Rs. 38.4

billion per business day. The total value of scripless

securities held by LankaSecure amounted to Rs.

4,846.0 billion (face value) consisted of Treasury

bills of Rs. 792.4 billion and Treasury bonds of Rs.

4,053.6 billion as at end December 2016.

During the year under review, the Cheque

Clearing System operated by LankaClear (Pvt.)

Ltd (LCPL) cleared a total volume of 51.9 million

cheques amounting to Rs. 9,601 billion. In terms

of total transaction volume, the share of payments

made through cheques in non-cash payments

accounted for 30.3 per cent in 2016, reflecting the

continuing popularity of cheques in effecting retail

payments. As a measure of enhancing the security

of cheque images during the transmission, in

October 2016, LCPL upgraded the cheque image

submission mode used by licensed commercial

banks when submitting cheque images to LCPL for

Payment Systems

The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005 of Sri Lanka defines a Payment System as “institutions and mechanisms facilitating payment in money and the transfer of monetary value by means of payment transactions, including mechanisms for clearing and settlement of obligations to make payments.” The transfer of monetary value was done traditionally by cash or by payment instruments, such as cheques and letters of credit. With the development of technology, countries have moved towards to electronic payment methods which are now commonly used throughout the world. This article highlights the role played by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in monitoring and regulating payment systems and their new developments.

Importance of Sound Payment Systems

Price stability and financial system stability are considered to be prerequisites for the achievement of economic growth. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has two core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability, and financial systems’ stability. Maintaining financial system stability can be described as ensuring a stable financial system where financial intermediaries can engage in transactions based on a smooth and efficient market infrastructure to promote economic growth. To maintain financial system stability, sound payment systems with minimal risk should be in place to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial sector. As all the participants of the payment system are interrelated, if one participant is exposed to risk, it may spread to other participants, causing systemic risk. Systemic risk is the risk of an entire system collapsing due to the ‘domino effect’ (a chain reaction) caused by the failure of one or more members of the system. In a payment system, credit or liquidity problems experienced by one member of the system could trigger a chain reaction, which will then affect other members of the same system.

Regulatory Framework

• The Central Bank vested with the sole authority under the Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949 and Payment & Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005 to supervise and regulate the payment, clearing and settlement systems of the country. Under the Payment & Settlement Systems Act, the Central Bank has the power to “formulate, adopt, and monitor the implementation of a payment system policy in Sri Lanka”. The Central Bank is also the authority responsible for “the preparation of a plan for the national payment system and is charged

BOX 13The Role of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the Regulation of Payment Systems

with the responsibility of providing guidance and leadership for the establishment and development of payment, clearing and settlement system for Sri Lanka”. Under the same Act, the Central Bank has been given the statutory authority to supervise, regulate and monitor all service providers who provides money services in Sri Lanka

• The Payment Cards and Mobile Payment Systems Regulations No. 01 of 2013, issued under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, has provided the Central Bank with the authority to regulate and supervise service providers of payment cards and mobile payment systems. In terms of Regulations, the Central Bank has the authority to carry out on-site and off-site supervision, and to issue directives on business relating to payment cards and mobile payment systems. Accordingly, the Central Bank has issued credit card guidelines in 2010 to ensure secure and safe operations of credit cards as payment instruments. In order to protect the customers who use mobile phone based payment services and service providers offering such services, Central Bank has issued guidelines in 2011.

• According to Business Continuity Planning (BCP) guidelines issued by the Central Bank, the participants of major payment systems of the country are required to conduct BCP drills periodically to build resilience in relation to payment systems. The Central Bank has the authority to carry out on-site and off-site supervisions to monitor the readiness of participating institutions to continue business in the event of a disruption to operations at the primary location of the institution. It also reviews BCP activities of participants to minimise the legal, financial and systemic risks arising from such disruptions.

Role of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

For regulatory purposes, the Central Bank designs policies and implements them at national level to facilitate the overall stability of the entire financial system by promoting safety, accuracy and efficiency of the payment system, and controlling the associated threats. The Central Bank facilitates safe payment methods and requires participants to be in accordance with international standards and certifications (electronic and non-electronic) to minimise fraud, in order to ensure the safety of the entire payment system. Furthermore, the

introduction of standards to the system will enable the management of existing resources, productively. The Central Bank monitors payment and settlement activities of all the participants so that vulnerabilities do not affect the system as a whole. Therefore, this will result in the participants having greater confidence in the system.

The safety and efficiency of a payment system in a country is essential since all its financial activities depend on it. Therefore, the Central Bank encourages new innovations and embraces new technologies with required security features to ensure smooth operations in the payment and settlement systems.

There are a multitude of payment services available in the market, which may or may not be interoperable with each other. An absence of interoperability could lead to an unnecessary fragmentation of the payment system and redundancy of such systems. In addition, it is essential for the regulator to continuously monitor payment systems to ensure effective utilisation, to minimise security threats to the system, and to avoid inconveniences caused to the public. To achieve these goals, the Central Bank evaluates to identify any negative impact to the payment system and to the system stability.

Another important aspect is the regulation of fees and charges in the payment system. Such regulations are to ensure that the participants of payment systems do not overcharge their customers for services provided. Therefore, the Central Bank imposes the maximum fee

chargeable for a particular service in the payment system and reevaluates this fee to promote the service and to give the benefit of new innovations in the field to customers.

Way Forward

According to the Acts specified in this article, the Central Bank is entrusted with regulation, supervision and monitoring of payment, clearing, and settlement services. It is also important to note that the current Payment and Settlement Systems Act encompasses the stability and security aspects to protect both existing and future payment systems, their participants and customers. Further, the Central Bank has set a regulatory framework in place and constantly monitors the performance of the participants to foresee whether any of them are headed towards potential instability. Such participants will be steered away from possible risks such as credit, liquidity, reputation, operations, legal, and settlement, in order to maintain the stability of the entire system and thus will safeguard the general public as well. Accordingly, the Central Bank will continue to maintain the integrity of the payment system to ensure the economic growth of the country through a stable financial system.

FATF Standards on AML/CFT

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the G7 countries, has developed a series of recommendations since 1990 that are recognised as the international standards on Anti Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These standards were revised in 2012, in order to ensure that they remain up to date and relevant. Every country in the world is required to follow the standards, thereby assuring that the domestic financial system is less vulnerable to criminal activities and the country is able to integrate into the global financial system without difficulty.

Importance of Complying with International AML/CFT Standards

A weak AML/CFT regime has the potential to undermine the soundness and stability of financial institutions and systems, discourage foreign investments and distort international capital flows. Conversely, a robust national AML/CFT framework benefits a country in a number of different ways;

1. Financial institutions that follow international standards are often reluctant to enter into business/market relationships with customers or institutions based in countries that are perceived to pose serious Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorist Financing (TF) risks. Financial institutions could broaden their links with counterparts abroad based on a strong and effective AML/CFT framework within the country.

2. A country or financial institutions could partner with more developed financial centres to attract foreign investments and participate in global payments systems in an effective manner.

3. Effective AML/CFT controls drive countries to establish legal, regulatory and institutional framework, facilitating financial transparency and strengthening the rule of law. Besides, a strong and robust AML/CFT regime forms a part of the broader effort to fight against crime and corruption.

4. Implementation of effective AML measures, such as the conduct of customer due diligence, identification of beneficial owners of financial transactions and reporting of suspicious transactions, can effectively control tax evasion, which is considered to be a predicate offence of ML.

BOX 14Sri Lanka’s Compliance with International AML/CFT Standards

Measuring the Country Compliance with International AML/CFT Standards

The FATF conducts reviews of each member on an ongoing basis to evaluate the levels of compliance with its recommendations. Currently, such reviews are mostly carried out through FATF Styled Regional Monitoring Bodies (FSRBs). At present, there are 9 FSRBs that are engaged in the assessment of member countries coming under each FSRB’s purview and these peer reviews are referred to as Mutual Evaluations (MEs).

With the revision introduced to FATF recommendations in 2012, the methodology used in the MEs was also revised and the FATF adopted the revised methodology in 2013, mainly focusing on the following two areas;

1. Technical Compliance (TC) - Assess the status of the relevance of the legal and institutional framework of the country and the powers and procedures of the competent authorities to comply with the FATF 40 Recommendations.

2. Effectiveness - Assess the extent to which the legal and institutional framework is capable of producing the expected results. The effectiveness assessment is based on 11 outcomes stated in the FATF methodology.

AML/CFT Compliance of Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka is a founding member of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), the FSRB for the Asia and Pacific region, which was formed in 1997. In accordance with the APG membership rules, Sri Lanka is committed to an ME by the APG to determine its level of compliance every six years.

Sri Lanka had its first ME by the APG in 2006 soon after the establishment of the FIU–Sri Lanka. A series of recommendations were made in the first Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), in order to rectify the gaps identified therein, including the requirement to amend several legislations and promulgate regulations on the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). Sri Lanka was able to fully implement the recommendations in the first MER by 2013.

The second ME on Sri Lanka was conducted in 2014/15 by a panel of evaluators representing the FIUs of Australia, Bhutan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and the APG Secretariat. The MER was adopted at the 18th Annual Plenary and Technical Assistance Forum of the APG held in Auckland, New Zealand in July 2015. Sri Lanka was rated compliant or largely compliant for

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

2828

12 recommendations out of 40 recommendations on TC and substantially and moderately effective in two immediate outcomes out of 11 immediate outcomes.

Major Actions Taken to Ensure Compliance

In response to the deficiencies highlighted in the MER, the FIU-Sri Lanka, together with other relevant stakeholders, implemented several systematic and concrete steps to improve the country's compliance with the FATF standards. These included;

• Adoption of the AML/CFT National Policy for 2015-2020 with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers

• Development of an institution-wise action plan to be implemented through each stakeholder as approved by the Cabinet of Ministers

• Issuance of Customer Due Diligence Rule No 1 of 2016 on 27.01.2016 covering all institutions engaged in finance business as defined in the FTRA.

• Introduction of risk-based AML/CFT supervision on financial institutions in 2016.

• Issuance of a separate AML/CFT guideline for MVTS providers.

• Enhancement of the investigative and prosecutorial capabilities of the Criminal Investigations Department and Attorney General’s Department on ML, respectively.

• Signing of Memoranda of Understandings (MOUs) with relevant domestic institutions and foreign counterparts by the FIU to share/receive information/intelligence to facilitate investigations.

Subsequent to the adoption of the MER in 2015, Sri Lanka was required to report the progress of

implementation to the APG bi-annually, under the `Expedite Enhanced Follow-up Process’ Accordingly, the 1st progress report was submitted in January 2016. The report was discussed at the APG Annual Plenary held in San Diego, United States in September 2016 by all members and the Plenary decided that Sri Lanka has made considerable progress on TC in relation to 9 recommendations initially rated as non-compliant or partially compliant. Accordingly, Sri Lanka’s AML/CFT compliance level has improved as follows:

Sri Lanka is currently under the APG `Enhanced Follow-up Process’, requiring the country to report AML/CFT progress to the APG annually.

However, Sri Lanka is yet to reach a satisfactory level of TC in relation to 19 recommendations, which have been rated partially compliant or non-compliant. Moreover, all stakeholders concerned are required to implement necessary actions highlighted in the MER and the action plan approved by the Cabinet of Ministers to improve AML/CFT effectiveness of the country in order to match the FATF standards.

informed business decisions. CRIB also continued

with its user awareness and educational programs

among credit officers and other staff of reporting

lending institutions as well as general public to

provide a better understanding of the CRIB’s role in

credit market and to enable prudent interpretation of

credit reports for risk management purposes.

During the year 2016, CRIB issued 7,948,967

credit reports on corporate and individual

borrowers, reporting a 15.4 per cent growth on

issuing credit information reports compared to

6,890,270 reports issued in 2015. This indicated

expanding credit related activities in the economy.

CRIB had a total of 87 reporting credit institutions as

its members by end 2016.
