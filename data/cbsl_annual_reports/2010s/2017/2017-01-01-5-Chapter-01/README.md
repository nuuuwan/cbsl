1.1 OverviewF

ollowing a period of uncertainty, the Sri Lankan economy showed early signs of stabilisation during the year 2016 in

response to corrective actions adopted by the

government and the Central Bank. Unfavourable

weather conditions and sluggish global economic

recovery caused the economy to grow at a slower

rate of 4.4 per cent in 2016 in real terms, in

comparison to 4.8 per cent in the previous year,

although a steady acceleration in quarterly growth

was observed from the second quarter of the year

amidst tightened fiscal and monetary policies.

Increased investment expenditure, especially in

the construction sector, drove economic growth

during the year, while consumption expenditure

slowed in response to the policy environment in

place. Inflation, which remained low in the first four

months of the year, increased thereafter to record

an annual average of 4.0 per cent in 2016 (both

National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100)

and Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI,

2013=100) based). The high levels of inflation

observed during some months in 2016 as well as

in the first quarter of 2017 were mainly due to the

adverse impact of weather related disruptions, tax

adjustments and rising international commodity

prices, but the increasing demand pressures of the

economy were evident in core inflation remaining

at elevated levels. Movements in external sector

balances reflected the continued domestic demand

for imports from certain sectors of the economy,

weak external demand for the limited basket of

domestic products, persistent failure of the country

to attract increased direct investment flows as

well as the impact of rising global interest rates

particularly on the government securities market.

These developments resulted in the balance of

payments (BOP) recording a deficit for the second

consecutive year in spite of improvements in

earnings from tourism and other service exports as

well as workers’ remittances. The Central Bank’s

heavy intervention in the foreign exchange market

continued in the first four months of the year

resulting in a broadly stable exchange rate during

this period. However, the exchange rate was

increasingly allowed to reflect market conditions

thereafter by limiting Central Bank intervention

to dampen the pressure on the exchange rate

arising from outflows of foreign investments from

the government securities market. Considering

1

Economic, Price and Financial System Stability, Outlook and Policies

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

1

the possible rise in demand driven inflationary

pressures, the Central Bank continued to tighten

monetary policy and monetary conditions throughout

the year. Accordingly, in addition to increasing

the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on

rupee deposit liabilities of licensed commercial

banks (LCBs) in December 2015 to be effective

from January 2016 and the continued application

of the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio as a selective

macroprudential demand management tool, the

Central Bank raised its key policy interest rates by

a total of 100 basis points in two steps during 2016,

the first in February 2016 and the second in July

2016. Open market operations of the Central Bank

also guided the short term market interest rates

to move to the upper bound of the policy interest

rate corridor, resulting in a considerable increase

in the market interest rate structure. In response to

tightened monetary conditions, the acceleration of

broad money growth subsided while the growth of

credit extended to the private sector by LCBs that

peaked at 28.5 per cent in July 2016, on a year-

on-year basis, also decelerated to 21.9 per cent by

end 2016. However, the deceleration of monetary

and credit expansion was below expectations,

and the Central Bank again adjusted its policy

interest rates upwards by 25 basis points in March

2017 with the view of signalling to the market the

intent of the Central Bank in maintaining inflation

in mid single digits in the medium term, within

its increasingly forward looking monetary policy

framework in which the management of inflation

expectations plays a vital role. The financial sector,

in the meantime, continued to expand during the

year whilst exhibiting resilience amidst challenging

market conditions both globally and domestically.

Meanwhile, fiscal operations registered a notable

improvement in both revenue and expenditure

fronts, resulting in the containment of the overall

budget deficit at the envisaged level of 5.4 per

cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In spite

of these achievements, central government debt

as a percentage of GDP increased, illustrating the

narrowing fiscal manoeuvrability within the overall

macroeconomic policy framework and highlighting

the necessity of continued efforts to sustain the

fiscal consolidation process.

The performance of the Sri Lankan

economy in 2016 reconfirmed the necessity of

addressing the deep rooted structural issues if

the country is to progress steadily towards a

higher growth trajectory, as envisaged. While

the government’s recent efforts, with the support

of multilateral agencies including the International

Monetary Fund (IMF), to formulate policy

frameworks required to address these issues as

well as emerging challenges are commendable, it is

essential that such policies are implemented swiftly

with consistency in order to improve productivity

and efficiency of the economy and to attract much

needed foreign direct investments (FDIs) and boost

investments from the domestic private sector, while

seamlessly integrating with the global production

networks.

1.2 Macroeconomic

Developments, Stability and Policy Responses in 2016

Real Sector Developments and Inflation

In 2016, the Sri Lankan economy grew by 4.4

per cent in real terms, amidst numerous global

and domestic challenges. Unfavourable weather

conditions that prevailed during the year adversely

impacted economic activity, primarily in the

Agriculture sector. Services related activities, which

constitute 56.5 per cent of real GDP, grew by 4.2 per

cent in 2016, on a year-on-year basis, supported by

the expansion in financial services (12.4 per cent),

insurance (8.5 per cent), telecommunications

(8.3 per cent), as well as transportation (4.1 per

cent) and wholesale and retail trade (2.5 per

cent). Industry related activities, which account

for 26.8 per cent of real GDP, recorded a notable

growth of 6.7 per cent, year-on-year, driven by

the subsectors of construction, and mining and

quarrying, which grew by 14.9 per cent and 14.4

per cent, respectively, jointly contributing 10.0 per

cent of GDP. Within the Industry sector, the growth

in manufacturing activities was low at 1.7 per cent.

Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing related activities

contracted by 4.2 per cent in 2016, resulting in a

reduction in their share in real GDP to 7.1 per cent

in 2016. Adverse weather conditions that prevailed

in 2016 resulted in a contraction mainly in paddy,

tea and rubber subsectors.

As per expenditure approach estimates,

economic growth in 2016 was primarily driven by

the expansion in investment expenditure during

the year. Accordingly, gross domestic capital

formation, which represents the level of investment

activity of the economy, grew by 19.6 per cent, while

accounting for 31.5 per cent of the nominal GDP.

Higher investment growth predominantly emanated

from the expansion in construction activities during

the year. Meanwhile, consumption expenditure,

which is the largest expenditure category of the

economy, recorded a modest growth of 4.1 per

cent in nominal terms, which was a considerable

moderation compared to the growth of 10.3 per

cent recorded in the previous year. The slowdown

in consumption was driven by the moderation in

private sector consumption expenditure due to

tightened monetary and fiscal policies, while public

sector consumption expenditure also moderated

in 2016 with ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts.

Although domestic demand grew by 8.2 per cent

in nominal terms (6.2 per cent in real terms)

during the year, net external demand declined by

9.6 per cent in nominal terms (22.5 per cent in

real terms) in 2016 reflecting both weakness in

Sri Lanka’s export markets and a decline in the

competitiveness of the economy as evidenced by

the continued fall in the country’s share of global

exports. Amidst these developments, domestic

savings improved to 23.8 per cent of nominal GDP,

with an increase in domestic savings due to the

improvement in both private sector savings and

government dissavings during the year. National

savings also improved in 2016 as a result of the

expansion in net current transfers from rest of the

world while net primary income from rest of the

world declined. Consequently, national savings as

a percentage of nominal GDP improved to 28.9 per

cent in 2016 compared to 26.0 per cent in 2015.

With the increase in both investment and savings,

the domestic savings-investment gap as well as the

national savings-investment gap remained broadly

unchanged from the previous year at 7.6 per cent

of GDP and 2.5 per cent of GDP, respectively, in

2016.

The value addition in Agriculture, Forestry

and Fishing related activities recorded an overall

decline of 4.2 per cent in 2016 compared to the

growth of 4.8 per cent observed in the previous

year. As a result, the GDP share of this sector reduced

further to 7.1 per cent in 2016 from 7.8 per cent in

2015. The contraction in the sector was particularly

due to adverse weather patterns experienced during

the year. The production of paddy (-8.3 per cent), tea

(-11.0 per cent), rubber (-10.7 per cent) and coconut

(-1.5 per cent) were the worst affected during the

year. The decline in paddy production following the

record bumper harvest in 2015, was largely due to

the decline in 2016 Yala production by 21.9 per cent,

despite the marginal improvement in 2015/16 Maha

production by 0.9 per cent. Tea production in 2016

witnessed a substantial decline due to both supply

and demand side factors. The prolonged drought in

tea growing areas during early 2016, the changes

in weather patterns with overcast conditions in mid-

2016 and the severe drought condition in late 2016

had a negative effect on tea production. Reductions

in the application of fertiliser and weedicides may also

have contributed to this decline. The average price

of tea in the international market remained broadly

stagnant in US dollar terms particularly during the

first half of the year with lower demand from major

export destinations. Rubber production declined to

the lowest volume reported in the past 50 years with a

drop in both the extent under tapping and the number

of tapping days in response to low international prices

for natural rubber owing to subdued petroleum prices.

Production of coconut dipped marginally during

the year and high domestic prices were observed

as a result of increased demand from coconut-

based industries and high export prices. Vegetable

production observed an increase mainly due to an

increase in the extent cultivated, as the effect of

adverse weather conditions prompted a shift from

other food crops to vegetable growing during the year.

The government embarked on several

programmes during 2016 to promote growth

and improve productivity in the Agriculture

sector. The national food production programme

for the period 2016-2018 focuses on several

targets including making the country self-sufficient

in selected crops, introducing productivity

improvement measures, ensuring remunerative

prices for farmers, enabling uninterrupted access to

competitive markets both locally and internationally,

mechanisation of farms, reducing post harvest

losses, strengthening the supply chain, expanding

the extent under cultivation, popularising the use of

high yielding seeds and introducing improved farm

management practices. The three-year national

programme titled “A Wholesome Agriculture - A

Healthy Populace - A Toxin Free Nation” has been

initiated with the intention of preventing the use of

highly toxic agrochemicals in the farming sector

and reintroducing the use of traditional varieties of

rice. Meanwhile, despite the high fiscal outlay, the

fertiliser subsidy cash grant scheme was continued

during the year. The Sri Lanka Tea Board

embarked on strategic marketing action to promote

generic tea under the brand of “Pure Ceylon Tea

packed in Sri Lanka”, continued with its “B Leaf 60”

programme and encouraged tea factories to obtain

Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP)

Certification, and granted subsidies under the

tea factory modernisation programme, while the

Tea Research Institute introduced tea cultivars

resistant to climatic change and other stress

conditions. The expansion of rubber cultivation in

non traditional areas was initiated by the Rubber

Development Department with the intention of

increasing national rubber production up to 200

metric tons by 2020. Further, an expert group

was formed by the members of the Association

of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC),

including Sri Lanka, to obtain recommendations

on stabilising international rubber prices. The

coconut industry witnessed initiatives taken by

the authorities to regularise the auctions, support

the establishment of new factories engaged in

desiccated coconut production and explore new

market opportunities. The government, with a

6

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

1

view to developing sugarcane cultivation and

processing for the improvement and expansion of

the industry, initiated a programme for scientific

cooperation between the Sugarcane Research

Institute and foreign research organisations, while

making arrangements to re-establish the Kantale

sugar factory. The largest multi-functional irrigation

project and the final project of the Mahaweli Master

Plan was completed with the Moragahakanda

reservoir, which commenced as a twin project

with the Kalu Ganga project with the objective

of distributing water in Matale, Anuradhapura,

Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee districts, to be

used for agricultural needs. As a result of the

measures taken by the government on restricting

Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing

activities, the fish ban imposed against Sri Lanka

by the European Union (EU) prohibiting fish exports

to the EU countries over a period of one and half

years was completely lifted in June 2016. The

government encouraged the establishment of Dairy

Development Zones in selected districts through

public-private partnerships (PPP), especially on

idle and underutilised land of the National Livestock

Development Board (NLDB) in order to increase

domestic milk production and reduce expenditure

incurred on importing of milk powder.

The value addition in Industry related

activities changed course to a higher growth

trajectory, expanding by 6.7 per cent in 2016

compared to 2.1 per cent in the previous year.

The robust growth of 14.9 per cent in construction

together with the growth in mining and quarrying;

manufacture of rubber and plastic products;

manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metal

products; and manufacture of machinery and

equipment contributed to the higher growth in the

Industry sector. However, the growth in production

of key subsectors such as food products, wearing

apparel, beverages, tobacco products, and

chemicals and chemical products was negative

during this period. Although there were disruptions

to the production of beverages during the first half of

the year on account of the floods, the production of

soft drinks, mineral and bottled water improved as

a result of high demand due to drought conditions

during the latter part of 2016. Tobacco products

were adversely affected by higher cigarette prices

with increased duties during the latter part of 2015

and further price increases during 2016.

The Industry sector received continued

support from the government for growth and

development as laid out in its export-oriented

industrialisation strategy. These measures were

implemented with a view to establishing Sri Lanka

as an export driven economic hub of the region

by enhancing its global competitiveness to further

integrate into the global value chain. The Ministry

of Industry and Commerce continued to facilitate

regional industrialisation by promoting investments

and provisioning of infrastructure facilities, and

technical assistance at the regional level. The Export

Development Board (EDB) is currently working with

a number of international partners to identify new

products and new markets to promote Sri Lankan

products. In addition, certain initial steps were taken

to set up an Innovation Accelerator during 2017, a

platform that will combine the National Innovation

Programmes of the Coordinating Secretariat for

Science, Technology and Innovation and the

National Thematic Research Programme and

the technology support schemes of the National

Science Foundation. A Biotechnology Innovation

Park, which will provide facilities mainly for

companies engaged in the pharmaceutical industry

and genomics, was proposed to be established

on a PPP basis. Meanwhile, the Central Bank

requested all LCBs to take appropriate measures

to implement the national policy approved in the

Budget 2017 to allocate at least 10 per cent of their

loan portfolio to the Small and Medium Enterprises

(SME) sector.

The value addition in Services related

activities grew by 4.2 per cent in 2016 compared

to 5.7 per cent in 2015. All services activities,

except for the professional services subsector,

grew in 2016. The growth in the Services sector

was primarily driven by a notable expansion in

financial service activities and the developments in

transportation of goods and passengers including

warehousing activities. A notable growth of 12.4 per

cent was recorded in the value-added in financial

service activities and auxiliary financial services in

2016. The wholesale and retail trade subsector,

which accounts for 10.6 per cent of GDP, grew

at a moderate rate of 2.5 per cent in 2016. As

the value added in the wholesale and retail trade

subsector is susceptible to variations in agricultural

and industrial production as well as imports, the

decline in agricultural and manufacturing output in

2016 deterred trade activities during the year, as

did the reduction in domestic demand as a result of

the tightening of fiscal and monetary policies.

The unemployment rate declined to 4.4 per

cent in 2016 from 4.7 per cent in the previous

year, while the number employed, increased by

1.5 per cent during the year with the expansion

in the Industry and Services related activities in

the economy. The reduction in female and male

unemployment rates to 7.0 per cent and 2.9 per

cent, respectively, in 2016, from 7.6 per cent and

3.0 per cent, respectively, in 2015, contributed

to the overall decline in the unemployment rate.

During 2016, the unemployment rates by the

level of education, declined across all categories,

although unemployment amongst youth (15-24

years) increased to 21.6 per cent in 2016 from 20.8

per cent in 2015. Meanwhile, the Labour Force

Participation Rate (LFPR) remained unchanged in

2016 at 53.8 per cent. Responding to policy actions

by the government to minimise the social impact

of unskilled female migration and the subdued

economic performance in a majority of Middle

Eastern economies and other labour destinations,

departures for foreign employment declined in

2016. However, the improvement in the skill profile

of the temporary migrants contributed to a moderate

increase in remittance inflows. Meanwhile, labour

productivity increased marginally during the first

three quarters of 2016. Labour productivity in the

Agriculture sector remained at a level significantly

lower than in the Industry and Services sectors.

Consumer price inflation moved upwards

during the first half of 2016, although it

stabilised somewhat during the remainder of

the year, while core inflation broadly followed

an upward trend in 2016. Headline inflation, as

measured by the year-on-year change in NCPI

(2013=100) was subdued in the first quarter of the

year as a result of imported deflationary effects

associated with low international commodity

prices. Headline inflation registered an increase

during the second quarter of the year reflecting

the impact of domestic supply side disruptions,

particularly due to adverse weather conditions, and

tax adjustments. However, some deceleration was

observed in inflation during the third quarter due to

the suspension of the implementation of changes

to the government tax structure and the recovery

in domestic supply conditions. Inflation remained

broadly stable thereafter although implementation

of new Value Added Tax (VAT) rates with effect from

November 2016 exerted some upward pressure on

prices. Accordingly, year-on-year headline inflation

based on the NCPI, which peaked at 6.4 per cent in

June 2016, gradually decelerated to 4.2 per cent by

end 2016, thus registering the same rate as at end

2015. On an annual average basis, however, NCPI

based headline inflation increased to 4.0 per cent

by end 2016 compared to 3.8 per cent at end 2015.

Following a similar trend, CCPI (2013=100) based

headline inflation also reached a peak of 5.8 per

cent in July 2016, before registering 4.5 per cent

at end 2016, while on an annual average basis, it

stood at 4.0 per cent by end 2016. Core inflation,

which measures the underlying inflationary

pressures in the economy, continued an upward

trend in 2016 although some volatility was observed

on a monthly basis. The impact of demand driven

inflationary pressures arising from the continued

expansion in monetary and credit aggregates was

shrouded by relatively low international commodity

prices and administered price revisions, while the

revision made to the tax structure had an upward

effect on core inflation during the first half of 2016.

Although core inflation stabilised for a few months

as a result of the suspension of the changes made

to the government tax structure, the reimposition

of the tax changes caused core inflation to move

upwards towards end 2016. Accordingly, NCPI

based core inflation stood at 6.7 per cent by end

2016, year-on-year, remaining higher than 5.8

per cent recorded at end 2015. Year-on-year core

inflation based on the CCPI declined from 6.7 per

cent at end 2015 to 5.8 per cent by end 2016. The

prevailing drought conditions, the effect of the tax

changes and rising international commodity prices

affected the movements in inflation in the first

quarter of the year 2017 as well, although tightened

monetary and fiscal policies enabled reining in of

demand pressures on inflation to a great extent.

External Sector Developments

Sri Lanka’s external sector performance

remained subdued in 2016, with foreign

exchange outflows exceeding the moderate

inflows during the year. The monetary policy

normalisation in the United States of America

(USA), subdued external demand due to the slow

pace of economic recovery in several advanced

economies and emerging market economies, and

persisting geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,

significantly dampened the performance of the

external sector. The widening of the trade deficit,

particularly in the last quarter of the year, and the

primary income deficit led to a deterioration in

the current account deficit during 2016, despite

surpluses in the trade in services and the secondary

income accounts. The subdued performance of

the financial account of the BOP stemmed from

continued outflows on account of debt repayments

amidst modest non debt inflows. Meanwhile, Sri

Lanka experienced outflows of foreign holdings

from the government securities market during

the year, and the Central Bank intervened in the

domestic foreign exchange market to dampen the

depreciation pressure on the Sri Lanka rupee. The

overall balance of the BOP recorded a deficit of US

dollars 500 million in 2016, and the gross reserve

asset position declined to US dollars 6.0 billion by

end 2016, from US dollars 7.3 billion recorded at

end 2015. With these developments, the rupee

depreciated by 3.83 per cent against the US dollar

in 2016.

Although the trade deficit contracted on a

cumulative basis during the first four months of

the year, it expanded significantly towards the

end of the year. The expansion in the trade deficit

was driven by the reduction in earnings from exports

compared to 2015 and the substantial increase in

import expenditure during the last quarter of the

year. Accordingly, the trade deficit widened to

US dollars 9,090 million in 2016 compared to US

dollars 8,388 million recorded in 2015 and the trade

deficit as a percentage of GDP increased to 11.2

per cent in 2016 compared to 10.4 per cent in 2015.

Earnings from exports contracted for

the second consecutive year in 2016 with

a contraction in earnings from agricultural

and industrial exports. Low commodity prices

in the international market, modest economic

recovery of Sri Lanka’s major export destinations

and disruptions in the domestic supply of export

oriented agricultural products mainly contributed to

the decline in export earnings by 2.2 per cent to

US dollars 10,310 million. However, the removal of

sanctions imposed on Iran by the USA in January,

and the lifting of the EU’s ban on seafood exports

from Sri Lanka in June, cushioned the overall

negative performance of exports resulting in a

reversal of the year-on-year declining trend

of exports towards end 2016. Despite the

improvements in earnings from the export of

textiles and garments (1.3 per cent) and base

metals and articles (60.5 per cent), overall export

earnings declined as a result of the decline in

earnings from transport equipment (-46.0 per

cent), petroleum products (-23.3 per cent), tea

(-5.3 per cent) and spices (-16.0 per cent). The

top ten export destinations remained unchanged

with the USA continuing to be the main export

destination, accounting for 27.3 per cent of total

export earnings, followed by the United Kingdom

(UK), India, Germany and Italy. Meanwhile, the

overall export volume index declined marginally by

0.7 per cent in 2016, while the export price index, in

US dollar terms, declined by 1.5 per cent.

Expenditure on imports increased during

2016, with a significant increase in expenditure

on intermediate and investment goods imports,

particularly in the last quarter of the year. The

benefit of low international commodity prices in

the international market and the impact of the

policy measures adopted by the government

and the Central Bank to rationalise imports, were

somewhat negated by the increase in imports of

investment goods and non fuel intermediate goods.

The significant growth in imports of machinery and

equipment (20.3 per cent) and building material

(16.0 per cent) led to an increase in the growth in

imports of investment goods (13.8 per cent) which,

in turn, was the key contributor to the growth of

4.2 per cent observed in the expenditure on non

fuel imports. In addition, the growth in intermediate

goods (2.4 per cent), such as textiles and textile

articles, and diamonds, precious stones and metals,

also contributed substantially to the increase in

import expenditure. Despite the rise in expenditure

on coal imports, the decline in expenditure on both

crude oil and refined petroleum imports resulted in

an overall decline in expenditure on fuel imports.

In comparison to 2015, import expenditure on

consumer goods declined by 8.4 per cent during

the year, primarily due to the substantial decline

of 41.5 per cent in expenditure incurred on the

importation of personal vehicles. As a result of

these developments, expenditure on imports

increased by 2.5 per cent during the year to US

dollars 19,400 million. Although India had been the

main source of imports since 2001, China emerged

as the key source in 2016. During the year, the

overall import volume index increased by 7.9 per

cent while the import price index declined by 5.1

per cent in US dollar terms reflecting deflationary

trends in the global economy.

Although the services account and the

secondary income account recorded surpluses,

the increase in the trade deficit and the primary

income account deficit caused the external

current account deficit to widen during 2016.

The services account continued to record a surplus

during the year led by the increased earnings from

tourism, followed by the export of transport, and

telecommunications, computer and information

services. Earnings from exports of services

recorded a growth of 11.6 per cent to US dollars

7,138 million in 2016. In addition to the rise in tourist

arrivals, the increase in the estimated average

spending per day and the improvement in the

estimated average duration of stay by tourists, led

to an 18.0 per cent growth in earnings from tourism

amounting to US dollars 3,518 million during the

year. Earnings from telecommunications, computer

and information services also increased from US

dollars 805 million in 2015 to US dollars 858 million

in 2016. Meanwhile, higher interest payments and

outflows in the form of reinvested earnings and

dividend payments led to outflows from the primary

income account amounting to US dollars 2,304

million. The increased level of outflows coupled

with the decline in earnings from reserve assets,

widened the deficit in the primary income account

in 2016. Lower income levels and geopolitical

uncertainties in the Middle East as well as domestic

11

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

policies to discourage labour migration under

the unskilled category resulted in a moderation

of workers’ remittances. Accordingly, workers’

remittances grew at a moderate rate of 3.7 per

cent to US dollars 7,242 million in 2016. Reflecting

these developments, the current account deficit

widened to US dollars 1,942 million, equivalent to

2.4 per cent of GDP in 2016 from 2.3 per cent of

GDP in 2015.

In the financial account, both net incurrence

of liabilities and net acquisition of assets

remained subdued in 2016. Accordingly, net

incurrence of liabilities amounted to US dollars

2,199 million in 2016 in comparison to US dollars

3,223 million in 2015 and the net acquisition of

assets amounted to US dollars 82 million during

2016 in comparison to US dollars 911 million in

the previous year. Total FDI inflows, which include

foreign borrowings by companies registered under

the Board of Investment (BOI), amounted to US

dollars 1,079 million during 2016 compared to US

dollars 1,160 million recorded in 2015. Foreign

portfolio investments in the share market remained

subdued while an outflow of foreign investments

from rupee denominated Treasury bonds and US

dollar denominated Sri Lanka Development Bonds

(SLDBs) was observed in 2016. In July 2016, Sri

Lanka successfully raised US dollars 1,500 million

through its 10th International Sovereign Bond (ISB),

which was its first dual-tranche issuance as well.

Total inflows to the government in the form of

foreign loans increased to US dollars 2,163 million

in 2016. These comprised project loans amounting

to US dollars 1,278 million, two foreign currency

term financing facilities worth to US dollars 700

million and programme financing amounting to

US dollars 185 million. Meanwhile, in view of the

deterioration in the BOP and to obtain support

for the government’s reform agenda, Sri Lanka

requested a three year Extended Fund Facility

(EFF) of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 1.1 billion

(approximately US dollars 1.5 billion) from the IMF,

and the first and the second tranches under this

facility amounting to US dollars 332 million were

received during the year. Repayments on account

of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) facility

obtained in 2009 were continued and amounted to

US dollars 455 million in 2016.

The overall balance of the BOP recorded a

deficit in 2016 reflecting the widening of the

current account deficit and relatively low level

of inflows to the financial account. The overall

deficit amounted to US dollars 500 million in 2016

compared to the deficit of US dollars 1,489 million

recorded in 2015. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s gross

reserve asset position declined to US dollars 6.0

billion, as at end 2016, equivalent to 3.7 months

of imports of goods and 3.1 months of imports of

goods and services. The decline in gross official

reserves was primarily due to foreign currency

debt service payments, settlement of international

foreign currency swap arrangements, repayment of

the IMF-SBA facility and the supply of liquidity to the

domestic foreign exchange market, particularly in

the first half of the year. Total foreign assets stood

at US dollars 8.4 billion at end 2016, which was

adequate to cover 5.2 months of imports of goods

and 4.3 months of imports of goods and services.

The total external debt of the country

increased during 2016 primarily due to the

increase in external government debt. The

outstanding external debt stock increased from

US dollars 44.8 billion (55.7 per cent of GDP) at

end 2015 to US dollars 46.6 billion (57.3 per cent

of GDP) at end 2016. External borrowings by the

government increased with the issuance of ISBs,

foreign currency term financing facilities and the

receipt of project loans. Capital repayments on

external debt remained high at US dollars 3,157

million in 2016, although this was a moderation in

comparison to US dollars 3,435 million in 2015.

12

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Large debt repayments during the year included

the settlement of international swap facilities and

repayments on account of the IMF-SBA. Further,

interest payments on outstanding external debt

obligations increased to US dollars 1,209 million in

2016 from US dollars 1,190 million in 2015, due to

increased interest payments by the private sector

and deposit taking corporations.

The rupee depreciated against all major

currencies except the pound sterling in 2016.

The depreciation pressure on the rupee was a

result of increased imports, continued foreign

debt service payments and outflows on account

of reversal of foreign investments from the

government securities market amidst monetary

policy normalisation in the USA. The Central Bank

supplied foreign currency liquidity to the market

heavily in the first four months of the year, and to a

lesser extent thereafter, resulting in a net supply of

US dollars 768 million during the year, compared to

US dollars 3,250 million in 2015. This intervention

was primarily to dampen the pressure on the

exchange rate arising from foreign outflows from

the government securities market. The rupee, which

remained broadly stable with heavy intervention

by the Central Bank in the first four months of the

year, was allowed to reflect market demand and

supply conditions to a great extent in the second

half of the year, resulting in an overall depreciation

of the rupee against the US dollar by 3.83 per

cent in 2016. In spite of this nominal depreciation,

the 5-currency and 24-currency Real Effective

Exchange Rate (REER) indices, which take into

account the variations in nominal exchange rates

and the inflation differentials among countries,

appreciated by 2.83 per cent and 2.70 per cent,

respectively, by the end of the year, reflecting

an erosion in the external competitiveness of the

rupee.

Fiscal Sector Developments

The increase in government revenue

stemming from the broadened tax base,

structural reforms in tax administration and

the rationalisation of government expenditure,

in tandem with the government’s commitment

to strengthen the fiscal consolidation process

contributed to the overall improvement of the

fiscal sector during 2016. The improvements in

fiscal operations, achieved under the government’s

revenue based fiscal consolidation process, helped

contain the overall budget deficit at the targeted

level of 5.4 per cent of GDP in 2016 in comparison

to the deficit of 7.6 per cent in the previous year.

In line with this, the current account deficit, that

reflects government dissaving, declined to 0.6 per

cent of GDP in 2016, significantly below the level

of 2.3 per cent of GDP recorded in 2015. The

primary deficit, which excludes interest payments

from the overall deficit, declined to 0.2 per cent

of GDP in 2016 from 2.9 per cent recorded in

2015. Nevertheless, several drawbacks were

observed in fiscal operations primarily due to the

sluggish implementation of structural reforms

in tax administration. At the same time, current

expenditure, which includes interest payments,

salaries and wages, and subsidies and transfers

to the household sector remained high despite

some rationalisation observed during the year.

Moreover, the fiscal sector was affected, to some

extent, by the increasing cost of borrowing as a

result of rising interest rates in both the domestic

and international markets and also the depreciation

of the rupee against major foreign currencies.

These developments, along with the accumulation

of substantial amounts of commercial foreign debt

across short to medium term maturities, highlight

the need for a national consensus on sustained

fiscal consolidation through timely implementation

of urgent fiscal and structural reforms.

Government revenue as a percentage of

GDP increased for the second consecutive

year to 14.2 per cent in 2016 from 13.3 per cent

recorded in 2015, mainly due to the increase in

non tax revenue during the year. Tax revenue

increased by 8.0 per cent to Rs. 1,463.7 billion in

2016 from Rs. 1,355.8 billion in 2015, although

tax revenue as a percentage of GDP remained

unchanged from the previous year at 12.4 per

cent. The increase in revenue collection from VAT,

Ports and Airports Development Levy (PAL) and

import duties positively contributed to the increase

in tax revenue, while a decline was observed in

revenue generation from excise duties on motor

vehicles, corporate and non corporate income tax

and withholding tax. In 2016, non tax revenue as a

percentage of GDP increased to 1.9 per cent from

0.9 per cent recorded in 2015, while in nominal

terms, it increased by more than two fold to Rs.

222.4 billion during the year. This was mainly due

to the increase in profit and dividend transfers

from state owned business enterprises (SOBEs)

mainly as a result of the improved performance of

those in the banking and insurance sectors, and

the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission

of Sri Lanka (TRCSL). Accordingly, in nominal

terms, government revenue increased by 15.9 per

cent to Rs. 1,686.1 billion in 2016 from Rs. 1,454.9

billion recorded in 2015 reflecting increases in

both tax and non tax revenue. While the share of

tax revenue in total revenue accounted for 86.8

per cent, indirect taxes continued to be the key

constituent of government tax revenue, accounting

for 82.3 per cent of tax revenue.

Total expenditure and net lending as a

percentage of GDP declined to 19.7 per cent

in 2016 from 20.9 per cent in 2015, reflecting

the decline in recurrent expenditure as well as

capital expenditure and net lending. The efforts of

the government to rationalise recurrent expenditure

and prioritise capital expenditure led to a reduction

in government expenditure. Accordingly, recurrent

expenditure as a percentage of GDP declined to

14.8 per cent in 2016 from 15.5 per cent in 2015.

In nominal terms, however, recurrent expenditure

increased by 3.3 per cent to Rs. 1,757.8 billion in

2016 from Rs. 1,701.7 billion in 2015, primarily due

to the increase in interest payments, followed by

the increase in expenditure on salaries and wages,

current transfers and subsidies. The relatively high

level of interest rates in domestic and international

markets, the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee

against major foreign currencies and the increase

in the outstanding domestic debt stock caused

a rise in interest expenditure during the year.

Consequently, interest expenditure, in nominal

terms, grew by 19.9 per cent to Rs. 610.9 billion in

2016 from Rs. 509.7 billion in 2015. Salaries and

wages, in nominal terms, also increased by 2.6 per

cent to Rs. 576.5 billion during the year. Meanwhile,

reflecting the streamlining and prioritising of public

investment programmes, capital expenditure and

net lending as a percentage of GDP, declined to

4.9 per cent in 2016 from 5.4 per cent in 2015,

while in nominal terms, a decline of 2.1 per cent

to Rs. 576.1 billion was recorded during the year.

Public investment declined to 5.0 per cent of GDP

in 2016 from 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2015, while

in nominal terms, it declined marginally by 1.5 per

cent to Rs. 594.0 billion in 2016 in comparison to

Rs. 602.8 billion in 2015.

During the year, the overall budget deficit

of Rs. 640.3 billion was largely financed from

foreign sources. Accordingly, foreign financing

contributed 61.2 per cent of total financing, while

the remainder was financed through domestic

sources. Accordingly, net domestic financing

declined to Rs. 248.4 billion during the year from

Rs. 592.7 billion recorded in 2015, while net foreign

financing increased to Rs. 391.9 billion during 2016.

With respect to net domestic financing, banking

sector borrowings, which accounted for 56.3 per

cent of net domestic borrowings, declined by

52.0 per cent to Rs. 140.0 billion in 2016 from Rs.

291.8 billion recorded in 2015. Although financing

of borrowings through Treasury bonds increased

significantly, borrowings from commercial banks

through Treasury bills and SLDBs recorded

a significant decline. However, the decline in

borrowings from commercial banks was offset by

the notable increase in borrowings from the Central

Bank amounting to Rs. 183.1 billion compared to

Rs. 80.3 billion in the previous year. Further, net

financing from the non banking sector declined

to Rs. 108.5 billion in 2016 from Rs. 300.9 billion

reported in 2015.

The central government debt to GDP ratio

increased to 79.3 per cent by end 2016 from

77.6 per cent as at end 2015. This was mainly due

to the increase in net borrowings and the modest

economic growth during the year. In nominal terms,

outstanding central government debt increased to

Rs. 9,387.3 billion as at end 2016 from Rs. 8,503.2

billion as at end 2015. Within this, total outstanding

domestic debt increased by 7.7 per cent to Rs.

5,341.5 billion, while total outstanding foreign debt

increased significantly by 14.2 per cent to Rs.

4,045.8 billion by end 2016.

Monetary Sector Developments

The conduct of monetary policy in 2016 was

aimed at stabilising the economy through the

containment of the possible rise in excessive

demand pressures in the economy. During 2016,

monetary aggregates grew at a faster pace than

projected underpinned by excessive expansion

in credit to both the government and the private

sector. As such, the Central Bank commenced

monetary tightening in several stages from end

2015. To begin with, the Central Bank raised the

SRR applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities

of LCBs by 1.50 percentage points to 7.50 per

cent with effect from 16 January 2016 to absorb

excess liquidity in the domestic money market on

a permanent basis. Furthermore, policy interest

rates of the Central Bank viz., the Standing Deposit

Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending

Facility Rate (SLFR) were raised by 50 basis points

each in February 2016 to 6.50 per cent and 8.00

per cent, respectively, in light of rising inflationary

pressures. Despite monetary tightening measures,

credit to the private sector continued to expand

while inflation indicated an upward trend, although

a significant portion of inflation was attributable

to tax revisions and disruptions to domestic

supply conditions. To pre-empt the escalation of

inflationary pressures and to support the BOP,

the Central Bank further tightened the monetary

policy stance in July 2016, by increasing the SDFR

and the SLFR by an additional 50 basis points

to 7.00 per cent and 8.50 per cent, respectively.

Alongside the increased policy interest rates, open

market operations (OMO) guided overnight interest

rates towards the upper bound of the policy rate

corridor. These efforts were complemented by the

macroprudential measures adopted in late 2015 as

well as the gradual adjustment in the exchange rate

throughout the period. Despite these measures,

headline inflation indicated an upward movement

towards end 2016 with continued supply side

disturbances and the reimposition of changes to

the government tax structure, while core inflation

also witnessed an increase. Although the growth

of credit disbursements to the private sector by

commercial banks decelerated to some extent, the

continued supply- and tax-driven rise in inflation,

particularly in early 2017, prompted the Central

Bank to tighten monetary policy further in March

2017 as a precautionary measure to contain the

build-up of adverse inflation expectations and

second round effects within its increasingly forward

looking approach to the conduct of monetary policy.

During 2016, market interest rates adjusted

upwards reflecting tight monetary conditions

in the economy. With the raising of SRR with

effect from January 2016, the increase in policy

interest rates in February 2016, and the gradual

decline in excess rupee liquidity in the domestic

money market, short term interest rates increased.

Accordingly, the Average Weighted Call Money

Rate (AWCMR), which is the operating target under

the present enhanced monetary policy framework,

increased to 7.50 per cent by end February 2016

compared to 6.40 per cent reported at end 2015.

Despite the increase in AWCMR beyond the upper

bound of the policy rate corridor reaching 8.15

per cent by early April 2016, OMOs conducted

by the Central Bank helped manage volatility in

short term money market rates to a large extent.

AWCMR hovered in the range of 8.15-8.24 per

cent thereafter until July 2016, and increased to

8.40 per cent with the policy rate hike in July 2016

before stabilising thereafter. By end 2016, AWCMR

stood at 8.42 per cent. Reflecting tight monetary

conditions and the high demand for funds from

the government, yields on Treasury bills showed

an upward trend during 2016 although some

moderation was observed in the second half of the

year. The impact of replacing the mixed system of

auctions and direct placements to raise funds for

the government with a purely auction based system

where direct placements of Treasury bills were

made only with the Central Bank, also contributed

to the increase in interest rates on government

securities. Accordingly, 91-day, 182-day and

364-day Treasury bill yields were at 8.72 per cent,

9.63 per cent and 10.17 per cent, respectively, by

end 2016 compared to 6.45 per cent, 6.83 per cent

and 7.30 per cent, respectively, reported at end

2015. Yields on long term government securities also

indicated a similar trend. With these developments,

a considerable increase in both lending and deposit

rates of commercial banks was observed in 2016.

Accordingly, the Average Weighted Deposit Rate

(AWDR) increased by 197 basis points to 8.17 per

cent by end 2016 from 6.20 per cent at end 2015,

while the Average Weighted Fixed Deposit Rate

(AWFDR) also increased by 289 basis points to

10.46 per cent by end 2016 from 7.57 per cent at

end 2015. Interest rates offered on new deposits

also increased substantially during the year.

Lending rates also increased, reflecting the impact

of the tight monetary policy stance, deficit liquidity

conditions and increased cost of funds due to high

deposit interest rates. Accordingly, the weekly

Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR),

which is based on interest rates applicable on

loans and advances granted by commercial banks

to their prime customers, increased by 399 basis

points to 11.52 per cent by end 2016 from 7.53

per cent at end 2015, while the monthly AWPR

increased by 433 basis points to 11.73 per cent by

end 2016 from 7.40 per cent reported at end 2015.

Similarly, the Average Weighted Lending Rate

(AWLR) increased by 220 basis points to 13.20 per

cent by end 2016 from 11.00 per cent at end 2015.

Further, the Average Weighted New Lending Rate

(AWNLR) also increased substantially to 14.37 per

cent by end 2016 from 10.79 per cent reported at

end 2015.

Reserve money recorded a high growth

of 27.1 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2016

compared to 16.5 per cent at end 2015. In absolute

terms, reserve money increased noticeably by Rs.

182.7 billion to Rs. 856.1 billion by end 2016. From

the liability side, the increase in both currency in

circulation and commercial bank deposits with the

Central Bank reflected the expansion in reserve

money. Commercial bank deposits increased

significantly during 2016, mainly as a result of the

upward adjustment in SRR in January 2016. On the

assets side, the expansion in reserve money was

entirely due to the increase in net domestic assets

(NDA) of the Central Bank, while net foreign assets

(NFA) declined during 2016. The expansion in NDA

was largely on account of the substantial increase

in the Central Bank’s holdings of government

securities, which led to an increase in net credit to

the government (NCG) by Rs. 183.1 billion to Rs.

413.0 billion by end 2016. The current system of

raising funds for the government under a purely

auction based system where direct placements of

Treasury bills are made only with the Central Bank

was a key factor that contributed to the increase in

NCG by the Central Bank.

Underpinned by the expansion in credit to

both the government and the private sector,

broad money supply (M2b) continued to

increase at a rate higher than projected in 2016.

Accordingly, the year-on-year growth of broad

money was at 18.4 per cent by end December

2016, compared to 17.8 per cent at end 2015, while

the average growth also remained elevated at 18.1

per cent. NFA of the banking system contributed

positively to the expansion in broad money supply,

reversing the trend observed in the previous year.

However, NDA of the banking system remained the

key factor contributing 92 per cent of the expansion

in broad money. This was mainly driven by the

expansion in credit flows to both the government

and the private sector. During the year, surpassing

17

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

the budgetary estimates, NCG from the banking

system increased by Rs. 212.6 billion compared

to the increase of Rs. 323.6 billion recorded in

2015. This increase was largely on account of

the considerable increase in credit extended

to the government by the Central Bank by Rs.

183.1 billion during the year compared to Rs.

80.3 billion in 2015, while NCG from commercial

banks also positively contributed to the overall

increase. Treasury bill holdings (net of repurchase

transactions) of the Central Bank increased

significantly to a historically high level of Rs. 330.0

billion compared to Rs. 79.2 billion recorded at

end 2015. Moreover, provisional advances to the

government, which is the other key component of

NCG, averaged around Rs. 184.6 billion during

the first eleven months of 2016 compared to Rs.

151.1 billion at end 2015, but declined temporarily

to Rs. 83.3 billion by end 2016. This was due to

the government settling a part of provisional

advances using funds raised through the issuance

of Treasury bills worth Rs. 100 billion to the Central

Bank during the month of December 2016. This

transaction, which was a temporary arrangement to

facilitate the government’s cashflow, was reversed

in January 2017. In contrast, credit extended

by the banking system to public corporations

declined during 2016, reflecting improvements

in the financial position of a number of SOBEs,

particularly the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

(CPC). However, borrowings of SriLankan Airlines,

Road Development Authority, Ceylon Fertilizer

Corporation, Ceylon Shipping Corporation and

Colombo Commercial Fertilizer increased during

the period under review.

Credit extended to the private sector by

commercial banks continued to expand during

2016 while some slowdown was observed

towards the end of the year. The year-on-year

growth of credit to the private sector, which was at

25.1 per cent at end 2015 peaked at 28.5 per cent by

July 2016, before declining to 21.9 per cent by end

2016 in response to the monetary policy measures

adopted by the Central Bank. In absolute terms,

the increase in credit extended to the private sector

was Rs. 754.9 billion during 2016 compared to the

increase of Rs. 691.4 billion in the previous year.

The contribution of state banks to this increase

in credit to the private sector was considerable in

2016, as the government borrowings from these

institutions were relatively low during the year. As

per the Quarterly Survey of Commercial Banks’

Loans and Advances to the Private Sector, credit

disbursed to all major sectors of the economy

expanded considerably in 2016. On a year-on-year

basis, credit flows to the Services and Industry

sectors expanded by 35.4 per cent and 22.2 per

cent, respectively, during 2016 compared to 34.1

per cent and 25.0 per cent, respectively, in 2015.

Within credit flows to the Industry sector, the year-

on-year increase in credit to the Construction

subsector was notable at 26.9 per cent. Credit to the

Agriculture and Fishing sector also grew by 17.0 per

cent, year-on-year, by end 2016, compared to the

growth of 7.5 per cent recorded in 2015. However,

within Personal Loans and Advances, Pawning

Advances continued to record a contraction while

credit in relation to Consumer Durables, Personal

Healthcare, Personal Education and Credit Card

Balances recorded an increase during 2016.

Financial Sector Developments

In 2016, assets of the banking sector

grew at a slower pace than in the previous

year mainly reflecting the tighter monetary

conditions that prevailed during the year, while

the sector continued to maintain its capital

and liquidity levels well above the minimum

statutory requirements. The asset base of the

banking sector recorded a growth of 12.0 per cent

driven by increased loans and advances. Deposits

of the banking sector expanded by 16.5 per cent

during 2016 mainly on account of the growth in

time deposits in the backdrop of a high interest rate

environment, although borrowings by the banking

sector recorded a decline of 3.5 per cent during the

year mainly due to a reduction in foreign currency

borrowings. Profitability of the banking sector as

measured by the Return on Assets (ROA) and

Return on Equity (ROE) improved during 2016

reflecting the increase in net interest income of

the banking sector. Meanwhile, the banking sector

maintained capital and liquidity at levels higher

than the minimum regulatory requirements, and

continued to manage risks prudently during the

year. Asset quality improved during 2016 recording

the lowest non performing loans (NPL) ratio in the

past two decades. In the meantime, the banking

sector expanded its operations during 2016

through the establishment of new banking outlets

and installation of new Automated Teller Machines

(ATMs).

The licensed finance companies (LFCs)/

specialised leasing companies (SLCs) sector

grew in terms of assets and the branch network

during 2016, while other non banking financial

institutions showed a mixed performance

amidst a challenging business environment.

The LFC/SLC sector expanded its asset base in

2016 as the sector placed more emphasis on

other loan products, gradually moving away from

the core business of financing the purchase of

motor vehicles. This growth was mainly funded

through domestic borrowings as the sector’s

reliance gradually shifted towards bank borrowings

from retail deposits considering its flexibility and

cost. Increased business volumes and improved

operational efficiency coupled with a moderately

increasing net interest income enabled the LFC/SLC

sector to post an increased level of profits in 2016.

Risks in the LFC/SLC sector as a whole remained

at manageable levels as reflected by comfortable

levels of NPL, liquidity and capital. Meanwhile,

Primary Dealers in government securities recorded

a decline in their total investment portfolio as

well as total assets. However, total capital and

profitability of the Primary Dealer industry recorded

a growth. In the Unit Trusts industry, total assets

as well as the number of units issued recorded

a decline in 2016. Investments in government

securities by Unit Trusts increased significantly,

while investments in equities recorded a marginal

decline. Meanwhile, total assets of the insurance

sector expanded in 2016 with the contribution of

both long term insurance and general insurance

19

business categories. Total profits earned by the

insurance sector marked a considerable growth

in 2016 led by an impressive performance in

the general insurance sector. The increase in

investment income amidst higher market interest

rates observed in 2016 and income in terms of

gross written premium contributed towards this

outcome. With regard to superannuation funds,

total assets of the sector recorded a modest growth

in 2016 as a combined result of the increase in

income generated through investments and net

contributions (contributions less refund payments)

by the members of these funds.

The regulatory agencies including the Central

Bank, initiated several measures to strengthen

the supervisory and regulatory framework for

financial institutions with a view to further

enhancing their safety and soundness, thereby

promoting public confidence in the financial

sector. The Central Bank further increased the

Capital Requirements for licensed banks under

Basel III to be effective from July 2017. All licensed

banks were requested to disclose key information

on regulatory capital, liquidity and risk management

with published financial statements, while greater

disclosure of fees charged for fund transfers were

also requested. All licensed banks were also

requested to submit reports on cybersecurity events

to the Central Bank with a view to addressing risks

emanating in relation to cybersecurity. Further,

measures were taken to promote the secondary

market for Government Securities among the

banking sector by enhancing transparency

and price discovery. With regard to the LFC/

SLC sector, the Central Bank continued to take

prudential measures keeping in line with improved

local and international standards and procedures,

while taking regulatory measures to resolve the

concerns with respect to weak finance companies

with a view to maintaining financial system stability.

Meanwhile, a regulatory framework for microfinance

companies was introduced by the Central Bank

during 2016 in terms of the powers vested under

the newly enacted Microfinance Act, No. 6 of 2016,

which is intended for licensing, regulating and

supervising unregulated microfinance companies

and Microfinance Non Governmental Organisations

(MNGOs). In the insurance sector, the Insurance

Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) took several regulatory

measures in 2016 with a view to safeguarding

the interests of policyholders while promoting the

professionalism and reputation of the industry. In

particular, all insurers and insurance brokers were

requested to obtain written approval from the IBSL

on changes in ownership or control, while long

term insurance companies were directed to grant

policyholders a 21-day cooling-off period (free-look

period) to examine the terms and conditions of the

policy documents.

1.3 Global Economic Environment and Outlook

According to the World Economic Outlook

of the IMF,1 the global economy gained

momentum in the second half of 2016 with

advanced economies registering a stronger

than expected pick-up, while slackened

economic activity persisted in emerging

market and developing economies. While

many advanced economies continued their

efforts to stimulate demand, emerging market and

developing economies exhibited diverse growth

and exchange rate outcomes depending on BOP

positions, fiscal situations and investment activities

in each country, despite being affected in general

by tighter conditions in global financial markets.

The agreement to limit oil production by a number

of major producers led to a gradual increase in

oil prices during the year. However, the general

1 World Economic Outlook - April 2017 and World Economic Outlook Update - January 2017

20

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

1

consensus is that prices are unlikely to rise above

US dollars 60 per barrel, as it is expected that

an aggressive supply response will be triggered

through fracking, particularly in the USA, at this

price. Prices of most commodities including food

commodities and base metals displayed an

increasing trend, particularly towards the latter

part of the year. Continued uncertainties in the

global economy as well as volatility in international

politics shrouded economic decision making for

policymakers as well as private investors.

The slow economic growth, particularly in

the first half of 2016, as well as low levels of

inflation called for accommodative monetary

policy to remain in force in advanced economies

throughout most of the year. However, with

the US economy increasingly showing signs of

sustained growth and employment generation, the

US Federal Reserve increased the Federal Funds

target rate in December 2016 and March 2017,

following its initial rate adjustment in December

2015. The referendum in the UK to leave the EU

too created uncertainties in financial markets and

the global economic outlook. Economic activity in

oil producing countries including Russia, showed

some improvement, with oil prices stabilising at

higher levels in the second half of the year. Policy

stimulus to rebalance growth in China towards

improving domestic demand and lesser reliance on

investment continued, creating uncertainty in global

commodity markets in which China is a major buyer

of key commodities such as petroleum and base

metals. In the face of these developments and

expectations, global interest rates moved upwards,

leading to portfolio outflows from many emerging

market economies during this period. During the

year, the US dollar appreciated vis-à-vis other

major currencies. The currencies of commodity

exporting countries including those of oil producers

appreciated, while the pound sterling, euro and the

Japanese yen depreciated.

The momentum in the global economy

is expected to persist in 2017 and 2018 with

the ongoing cyclical recovery in investment,

manufacturing and trade. For the first time since

the onset of the great recession, the first quarter

of 2017 has seen a synchronised upturn in the

USA, Europe, Japan and some key emerging

markets. Such growth will be propelled by the

effects of broadly accommodative monetary

policy and expansionary fiscal policy measures of

advanced economies that are expected to spillover

to emerging market and developing economies.

Fiscal policy is expected to be more expansionary

in the USA in 2017. Expansionary fiscal and

monetary policies in other advanced economies

including the UK, the EU and Japan are expected

to support growth in the next one to two years as

well, while rising commodity prices are likely to lift

global inflation and reduce deflationary pressures

experienced by some of these economies.

However, current global growth projections are

highly contingent on the effects of the protectionist

stance on international trade that the new US

administration has pledged to introduce. Therefore,

global growth in the next two years will be marked

by the responses that are unfolding amongst the

trading partners of the USA as they search for new

markets domestically and internationally and new

growth stimulants. In the meantime, prospects for

the UK have been clouded by the effects of Brexit

while Japan will explore avenues to regain market

access lost by the USA’s withdrawal from the Trans-

Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. China’s

high growth is expected to be supported by policy

stimulus, though its effects on credit expansion and

budgetary constraints may require abrupt policy

adjustments in the period ahead. India’s growth,

which at present is considered the highest amongst

large economies, is forecast to be somewhat lower

than expected in 2017 due to the impact of the

withdrawal of high denomination currency notes

from circulation. Growth rates in economies that

are dependent on oil incomes, particularly those

in the Middle East, are also expected to slowdown

due to lower levels of oil production, in spite of the

expected increase in oil prices.

The acceleration in global growth and the

resultant increase in global interest rates could

have diverse effects on the Sri Lankan economy.

The increase in oil prices as well as prices of other

commodities in the global markets will weigh

negatively in aggregate on the BOP and domestic

price indices, while stagnant growth in the Middle

East could reduce the income from tea exports and

remittances by migrant workers. Tourist arrivals

may pick up with high economic growth in Europe,

China, India and Russia, which are Sri Lanka’s

major sources of tourism. Sri Lanka, along with

other small economies in Asia, could experience

higher direct investment inflows, given the rising

levels of South-South FDIs. The proposed trade

and economic partnership arrangements in the

region could enable Sri Lanka to gain access to

larger regional markets with higher income levels.

The tightening of financial markets, however, pose

numerous challenges to Sri Lanka, in relation to

borrowing in international financial markets that

are necessary to rollover previous borrowings, and

in relation to payment of interest on floating rate

US dollar denominated instruments that are being

used to finance the budget deficit.

1.4 Medium Term Macroeconomic Outlook

The Sri Lankan economy is projected to

grow at a moderate rate of around 5.0 per cent in

2017 amidst the adverse impact of unfavourable

weather conditions, and is expected to improve

gradually thereafter to record an annual growth

rate of 7.0 per cent by 2020. The private sector is

expected to play a key role in achieving this higher

growth momentum by exploiting potential growth

opportunities in the economy and external markets.

Accordingly, economic expansion would be

supported through increased investment from the

private sector. Foreign investors are expected to

contribute towards a higher level of investment with

particular emphasis on services related activities

and export oriented industries. The opportunities

for the private sector would include the planned

establishment of the Colombo Financial City,

new opportunities under the Western Region

Megapolis Project and the proposed establishment

of economic corridors in the North East and South

West of the island, and also in the areas surrounding

the Hambantota and Trincomalee ports. In addition

to these initiatives, domestic investment activities

are also expected to continue with emphasis on

improving productivity through the adoption of new

technology including mechanisation initiatives in

22

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

1

the Agriculture and Industry sectors together with

the adoption of information technology (IT) related

improvements. These developments are expected

to be supported by complementary policy measures

of the government in creating a conducive

environment for economic expansion. Such policy

measures would include structural adjustments in

both the fiscal and external sectors together with

prudent macroeconomic management policies.

Further, appropriate monetary policy measures

are expected to maintain inflation at around 5.0 per

cent, on average. The nominal exchange rate is

also being allowed to adjust to attain a real effective

exchange rate (REER) index of 100 and to maintain

it at that level to support the competitiveness

of the economy. With these developments, the

production capacity of the economy would improve

supporting higher domestic production, which

could be exported through improved market access

supported by favourable policy initiatives. Hence,

in the medium term, economic growth would be

supported by all major sectors of the economy

amidst increased demand from both domestic and

external sectors resulting in Sri Lanka progressing

towards an upper middle income economy.

The external sector outlook is projected

to gradually improve during the medium

term with the adoption of appropriate

policy measures to ensure external sector

stability. The external current account deficit is

expected to improve steadily with the projected

developments in the external sector. Exports

are projected to increase at a higher rate than

imports, resulting in a narrowing of the trade

deficit in the medium term. The rise in exports is

projected to emanate from higher export oriented

domestic production supported through improved

trade linkages, including the reinstating of GSP+

concession and proposed trade and economic

partnership agreements. Imports would also

continue to increase, particularly with higher

intermediate goods imports with the expected

increase in global oil prices and higher demand

for investment goods due to the projected

increase in investment expenditure. Meanwhile,

the services account is projected to record a

surplus in the medium term with higher inflows

particularly from tourist receipts, transportation

services and telecommunications, computer

and information services. Realisation of these

higher receipts from the rest of the world would

depend on initiatives aimed at improving market

access and diversification of services exports.

Workers’ remittances that have contributed

substantially towards dampening the deficit

in the current account is expected to improve

further, albeit at a slower pace. The projected

slowdown in workers’ remittances is attributed

to the decline in migration with better domestic

employment opportunities, and initiatives aimed

at discouraging semi-skilled and unskilled

migration together with unfavourable economic

developments in some traditional migration

destinations. Meanwhile, the financial account

of the BOP is expected to improve with higher

inflows through non debt creating sources such

as FDI, as well as continued foreign financing

for development projects and proceeds through

debt securities, such as the issuance of ISBs.

Meanwhile, it is expected that the reliance on

debt related inflows would gradually subside

during the medium term, while more sustainable

foreign inflows through higher export proceeds

and foreign investment inflows would contribute

to the gradual strengthening of international

reserves, improving the resilience of the external

sector in the medium term.

The Central Bank officially announced in

its “Road Map: Monetary and Financial Sector

Policies for 2017 and beyond” that the conduct

of monetary policy will be strengthened by

adopting a Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT)

framework in the medium term. Currently, the

Central Bank conducts its monetary policy within

an enhanced monetary policy framework with

features of both monetary targeting and inflation

targeting. Going forward, the conduct of monetary

policy of the Central Bank will be based on a FIT

framework with the objective of maintaining price

stability with due attention to real sector stability

in the context of exchange rate flexibility. The

sustained low inflation environment and continued

efforts towards fiscal consolidation have created

an enabling environment for the smooth transition

towards a FIT framework in the medium term. At the

same time, the Central Bank is currently working

with international agencies to implement necessary

legislative and operational changes to facilitate this

process. These legislative changes are expected

to ensure accountability and credibility of the

envisaged inflation targeting framework. Moreover,

the Central Bank is in the process of enhancing its

technical capabilities. In this regard, a joint effort

has been initiated by the Central Bank and the IMF

in developing a structural model-based Forecasting

and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) to strengthen

the monetary policy decision making process and to

support Sri Lanka’s transition to a FIT regime (See

Box Article 01: Model based Approach to Monetary

Policy Analysis in Sri Lanka). These tools are

expected to provide a better understanding of the

Sri Lankan economy to formulate effective policies

in a forward looking manner, while enabling early

detection of potential risks and their impact on the

future path of key macro variables. Furthermore, it is

also expected that the government’s ongoing fiscal

consolidation programme strongly supports the FIT

1The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is currently improving its monetary policy framework and increasingly aligning it with a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework.1 In a broad sense, FIT denotes the setting of policy rates in a manner so as to stabilise inflation around the targeted rate with due regard to the stability of the economy (Palmqvist, 2007). Therefore, within a FIT framework, the inflation forecast will be the centric element to manage and communicate the short-run output-inflation trade off.

In the transition to a FIT regime, it is essential that a central bank becomes increasingly transparent and forward-looking. The use of structural models for medium term projections and policy analysis has become indispensable for this purpose. These models would equip the central bank with the ability to determine the path of monetary policy actions needed to bring inflation to its medium term objective while stabilising real output at its potential level. The model outcomes can also pave the way for structured debate about underlying assumptions, risks and policy issues, and will permit greater transparency in policy decisions and communication (Alichi and Benes, 2015).

Inflation Targeting – An Overview

A unique advantage of inflation targeting is that it comprises a framework for monetary policy that combines elements of both ‘rules’ and ‘discretion.’ The inflation target, therefore, provides a rule-like framework on which economic stakeholders can anchor their expectations about future inflation, whilst the central bank can exercise its discretion in reacting to shocks (Hammond, 2012).

The key essential elements of an inflation targeting framework are:

(i) Public announcement of a quantitative target for inflation.

(ii) Monetary policy is based on a wide set of information, including a medium term inflation forecast, which facilitates forward looking monetary policy decision making.

(iii) High degree of transparency and the presence of accountability mechanisms.

Several pre-requisites have been identified as essential to the establishment of a successful inflation targeting framework. These include the central bank’s operational independence and an explicit mandate to achieve price stability, central bank’s freedom from fiscal dominance, reasonably well

understood monetary transmission channels, proper coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, a flexible exchange rate regime, a sound methodology for macroeconomic analysis and forecasting, and a well-developed financial system and transparent policies to build accountability and credibility of the central bank (Schaechter et al., 2000).

The CBSL has already met certain prerequisites of an inflation targeting framework. Along with the CBSL’s independence in selecting operating instruments and with a mandate to maintain price stability, it has taken several initiatives during the recent past to further equip the monetary policy framework for inflation targeting. Accordingly, the CBSL has begun to enunciate its policies through a public policy document, developed in-house macroeconomic forecasting tools, published expected path for future inflation and commenced the conducting of the inflation expectations survey (CBSL, 2017). Over this period, the CBSL has also strengthened its technical capacity in data collection and management, and modelling and forecasting of key macroeconomic variables.

Since the adoption of inflation targeting by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1989, the best practices of IT evolved over time, and now all inflation targeting central banks conduct FIT rather than strict inflation targeting (Palmqvist, 2007; Svensson, 2009). The term “flexible inflation targeting” was introduced by Svensson (1999) to define a situation where the central bank minimises welfare loss to the society, as measured by inflation’s deviation from its target as well as output’s deviation from its potential level. However, in practice, the flexibility associated with FIT can be interpreted not only in terms of its consideration of real economic developments, but also in terms of the target horizon and how quickly the central bank tries to rein inflation back to the targeted rate following a deviation (Palmqvist, 2007).

The Need for Model based Projections and Policy Analysis for FIT

The successful implementation of FIT hinges on reliable medium term forecasts and the knowledge of the monetary transmission mechanism. Advanced macroeconomic models can help in gathering a thorough understanding of the economy and evaluating potential risks and their impact on the future path of key macro variables. Hence, these models can increase the robustness of the policymaking process. Further, monetary policy impacts inflation and output through a complex transmission mechanism which involves a number of linkages among macroeconomic variables and expectations of economic stakeholders. 1. For a detailed discussion, see Box Article 01 in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2007 and Box Article 10 in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2015.

Therefore, it is vital to possess reliable forecasting and policy analysis tools that also take into account the unique characteristics of the Sri Lankan economy.

It is typical of FIT central banks to possess a suite of models to determine the medium path of the economy (Black et al., 1994; Black et al., 1997; Coats et al., 2003). Although the CBSL has been engaged in macroeconometric forecasting in the past, with a view to further strengthening its policy formulation and modelling capacity, it initiated structural modelling with customised training and technical assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As such, a joint effort has been made by the CBSL and the IMF in developing a structural model-based Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) over the medium term, to strengthen the monetary policy decision making process and to support Sri Lanka’s transition to FIT.

With the creation of a permanent Modelling and Forecasting Division in the Economic Research Department (ERD), the CBSL has taken a key step in the effective implementation of FPAS. Several initiatives are underway to upgrade the technical capabilities of relevant staff so as to strengthen all macroeconomic projections, including inflation projections, using short-term and medium term forecasting tools and techniques. Accordingly, the ERD, with inputs from other departments of the CBSL, is managing a comprehensive analytical database, which will not only serve the data requirements of FPAS but highlight potential areas for research.

FPAS – An Overview

FPAS is a medium term pre-emptive policy analysis system which brings together information and judgment in a coherent and logical manner. It includes collecting, analysing and processing information and assumptions for the formulation of forward-looking policies, with preference often given to long term stabilisation. Moreover, FPAS combines several tools and processes which equip staff with the ability to conduct high-quality macroeconomic analysis and forecasting exercises that will support decision making. The structural model at the core of FPAS facilitates quality policy discussions about forecasts, potential risks to forecasts and appropriate responses to various shocks, and allows to construct policy scenarios. The prevalence of a structured FPAS system entails several other benefits. These include:

o Improved communication between all staff engaged in the forecast and policy debates, which creates important synergies and paves the way for continual improvement of the process of reaching a unanimous decision.

o A more structured debate about potential risks, allowing policymakers to better identify and communicate key policy issues.

o Development of a database to assess the efficiency of historical forecasts and thereby identify areas for new research.

o Development of a highly specialised pool of macroeconomic forecasting and research staff.

o Development of institutional knowledge about the monetary transmission mechanism and the impact of emerging shocks or disturbances.

o Potential for increased transparency about the systematic aspects of monetary policy and the means by which the forecast is developed. (Laxton, 2009)

While several central banks such as those in Canada, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, Thailand and India have successfully established FPAS, a number of other central banks are currently in the process of developing such a system.2 An essential element of FPAS is the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM), which is a semi-structural, forward looking open economy gap model that assists in the generation of a medium term policy path that is consistent with meeting of targets under the FIT regime (RBI, 2016). It is based on the principles of new-Keynesian open economy which embody the general view that monetary policy influences aggregate demand and output dynamics in the short run. In the long run, the policy influences only nominal variables (e.g. inflation), whereas real variables (e.g. real GDP growth) are determined by factors beyond the control of the monetary policy (e.g. growth in productivity, fiscal policies affecting income redistribution, etc.). These models are also built on micro-foundations and rational expectations.

Accordingly, under FPAS, the CBSL has finalised the development of the baseline version of a semi-structural QPM for forecasting and analysis of monetary policy.3 The benchmark model consists of four main behavioural equations, which represent aggregate demand (Investment-Saving or IS curve), aggregate supply (Phillips curve), the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition, and the monetary policy-reaction function (Taylor-type interest rate rule combined with a foreign exchange rule).

The QPM also accounts for multiple shocks that the Sri Lankan economy is prone to. These are broadly categorised as aggregate demand, supply, exchange rate, monetary policy and risk premium shocks.

Currently the CBSL utilises several econometric models to conduct near term forecasting (NTF) exercises for GDP and inflation. A set of advanced NTF models is

supposed to complement the QPM in better capturing the idiosyncratic shocks to inflation and GDP over the short-term.

Additionally, the implementation of FPAS will help enhance the CBSL’s communication with the stakeholders and general public, as it will complement the communication of the projected medium term path, with a comprehensive analysis and explanation of assumptions and judgments underpinning the projection, and the potential risks to the realisation of such projections.

Way Forward

The complete adoption of FPAS requires material changes in the monetary policy formulation process as well (Chart B 1.1). Accordingly, the number of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings has already been reduced to 8 meetings per year in 2017 from the previously conducted 12 meetings per year. This revised MPC process will enable more time for staff to conduct a comprehensive analysis of economic developments and thereby facilitate the provision of in-depth and more forward looking insights to the monetary policy formulation process.

In the long term, FPAS will also have a pivotal role to play in the adoption and subsequent success of the FIT framework, as the CBSL will communicate the medium term forecasts of key macroeconomic variables to the public. IT central banks have referred to inflation targets and forecasts, conveyed through inflation reports, as their primary communication tools in order to anchor inflation expectations. In the past, a thorough understanding of monetary policy decisions has been a difficult task for the public. However, the publication of inflation reports in the future is expected to largely bridge this information gap between the CBSL and the public. Such reports will also compel policymakers to remain not only transparent, but also accountable for announced

targets. In the event of missed targets, policymakers will be obliged to provide an exhaustive justification for the underperformance and the public will also be equipped to understand policy shortcomings. These changes are also expected to be supplemented by necessary legislative amendments aimed at strengthening the CBSL to conduct monetary policy more independently within a flexible exchange rate regime.

A coherent framework based on FPAS will equip policymakers in a FIT regime to generate proactive policy analysis that will enable the creation of a growth conducive, low-inflation environment.

framework, particularly through reduced reliance

on the Central Bank for financing the fiscal deficit.

This would also help maintain monetary and credit

aggregates at levels consistent with envisaged real

economic growth and mid-single digit inflation, while

avoiding undue volatility in interest rates. As the

success of the monetary policy framework is also

dependent on effective transmission of monetary

policy through sound financial markets, the Central

Bank is also expected to work in collaboration with

other regulatory bodies and authorities to introduce

required policies to develop and deepen the

financial markets in the medium term.

The medium term fiscal strategy of the

government focuses on strengthening the

revenue based fiscal consolidation process

by maintaining stability of the fiscal sector by

reducing the budget deficit and government

debt to a sustainable level. In this endeavour,

the government has displayed its commitment

by adopting several policy measures to enhance

revenue collection and rationalise expenditure.

Accordingly, the budget deficit is expected to

be around 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2020. The

government plans to increase the revenue to GDP

ratio to around 16 per cent by 2020 with a number

of policy initiatives, including the automation of

revenue collecting agencies, risk based auditing,

efficiency enhancing measures, simplification of tax

legislation and broadening the tax base. Further,

medium term strategic priorities of the government

also include rationalising ineffective public

expenditure, restructuring SOBEs to operate them

as commercially viable entities, improving fiscal

transparency and accountability in public financial

management and proper targeting of subsidy

schemes. Implementation of the commitment

control mechanism for the ministries and submitting

quarterly expenditure and income reports to

the Parliament will also strengthen expenditure

management efforts. The overall objective is

to improve the quality of public expenditure by

aligning its composition with national priorities

within the medium term budgetary framework.

The revenue based fiscal consolidation process

will expand the fiscal space and allow for more

spending on growth drivers in the medium term.

This is also expected to preserve the government’s

fiscal space for increasing infrastructure spending

and effective fiscal outlay for key social spending

categories such as education, health and other

social protection schemes, while maintaining public

investments at a sufficient level. The medium term

debt management strategy is expected to provide

a framework for a prudent borrowing programme

ensuring the availability of adequate funding for

the government’s financing needs at the lowest

possible cost with minimum risks. Accordingly,

central government debt is expected to be reduced

to around 70 per cent of GDP by 2020.

1.5 Issues and Policies

The realisation of Sri Lanka’s envisaged

medium term growth path is contingent upon

addressing the deep rooted structural issues in

the economy, which have prevented the country

from maintaining a high and sustainable real

GDP growth rate over time. Along with supportive

fiscal and monetary policy measures taken in

a timely manner, it is necessary to implement

policies to address the structural issues in the

economy aimed at improving productivity and

efficiency, thereby resetting the growth trajectory of

the country in order to harness its full potential in

the medium term and beyond.

Although declining earnings from exports

as a percentage of GDP have been partly due to

weak external demand, the internal factors that

have contributed to the continuation of such a

trend cannot be ignored. Earnings from exports

28

contracted for the second consecutive year in 2016

and remained at a level lower than the earnings

recorded five years ago. Being a middle income

economy with comparatively high living standards,

exporting the same primary commodities and

low value added merchandise over the last two

decades, and the limited manufacturing of complex

and knowledge-intensive products, have hindered

the growth prospects of Sri Lankan exports. This

highlights the need for both product and market

diversification. Producing more complex, high

value added and more technologically intensive

products, while integrating with regional and global

production networks would act as a catalyst in Sri

Lanka’s transition towards becoming an export

oriented economy. Producing high value added

products using minerals that are currently exported

in primary commodity form is one strategy that

needs to be pursued in this regard. It is necessary

to implement a coordinated approach which stems

from the current efforts of the government within

its overarching development policy, to identify

products and services or their components in the

value chain for which Sri Lanka has a competitive

edge, resurrect the manufacturing sector, attract

FDI, and explore trade channels. Meanwhile, a

market based exchange rate reflecting foreign

exchange demand and supply conditions, reducing

para-tariffs, which have contributed significantly

to the economy becoming as closed as it was in

1970, and maintaining low and stable inflation as

well as competitive wages would also ensure Sri

Lanka’s export competitiveness (See Box Article

07: National Strategy towards Export Promotion).

Given stagnant earnings from merchandise

exports, the importance of non traditional

service exports has grown significantly,

although focused efforts are required to tap

their full potential. In order to increase earnings

from service exports, developing the information

technology, business process outsourcing, and

knowledge process outsourcing (IT/BPO/KPO)

industry is a viable option. Sri Lanka can leverage

the educated, English proficient and highly trainable

workforce to develop this industry. This is an area in

which Sri Lanka has a competitive edge in terms of

relatively low cost labour in comparison to countries

with a similar workforce. An increasing number of

youth are gaining educational qualifications in the

fields of accountancy, information technology,

business management, law and international

languages. In addition, Sri Lanka’s legal system

is based on the English Law, specially the law of

contract and laws relating to companies, which

makes the workforce easily trainable to provide

secretarial and other back-office services to

ventures from Commonwealth nations. In addition

to IT/BPO/KPO related service provision, concerted

efforts are necessary to maximise on the country’s

strategic location as envisaged, and expand other

service exports such as maritime and aviation

services by adopting a national strategy on the

development of these sectors.

While capitalising on its rich cultural heritage

and diverse natural attractions, Sri Lanka needs

to widen its product offerings to attract high

spending tourists. The tourism sector has thrived

in post-conflict Sri Lanka, annually attracting over

two million tourists and earnings over US dollars

3.5 billion by 2016. As a travel destination, Sri

Lanka is unique in its offerings with iconic cultural

and historic sites, wildlife sanctuaries, pristine

beaches and picturesque landscapes. However,

a coordinated strategy is necessary to diversify

the range of attractions further to cater to the

varied demands of tourists. Identifying different

key tourist cohorts and putting in place strategies

that target each individual cohort is imperative,

as a single approach strategy would not attain

the desired outcomes. For the general tourist,

29

developing the periphery of isolated attractions,

popularising adventure activities, setting up theme

parks, expanding ayurvedic treatment facilities,

and streamlining transport facilities and informal

accommodation would enhance Sri Lanka’s

attractiveness. Special attention is required to entice

high spending tourists through the establishment

and promotion of boutique hotels and yacht marinas

while developing the entertainment economy

to cater to this niche market. Ensuring a high

quality experience for tourists will inspire repeat

visitation and positive word-of-mouth advertising.

In addition, such increased services may result in

the average stay per tourist to increase beyond the

current 10 nights and generate additional tourism-

related revenue while increasing direct and indirect

employment opportunities.

As evidenced by realised inflows, Sri

Lanka’s attractiveness for FDI has remained

low in spite of continued efforts to facilitate

such investments. A reversal of this trend is

urgently required. Failure to attract satisfactory

amounts of FDI contributed to the high reliance

on foreign debt to finance the current account

deficit, increasing the country’s already high

level of indebtedness. The strategies that are

being developed by the government need to be

implemented expeditiously with a view to attracting

higher levels of FDI to the country, particularly in

the backdrop of relatively higher FDI inflows to

emerging market economies such as Vietnam,

Myanmar and Bangladesh. Consistent domestic

policies that are aimed at improving Sri Lanka’s

competitiveness, strong institutional support and

targeted promotional campaigns highlighting the

potential of Sri Lanka as an attractive destination

for investment would be instrumental in creating

an enabling environment for FDI (See Box Article

02: Improving Sri Lanka’s Competitiveness within

Global Markets).

The implementation of a well-coordinated

industrial policy framework is essential for the

country to integrate with global value chains

with the aim of enhancing manufacturing

output, thereby boosting Sri Lanka’s industrial

exports. Although industrial policies adopted

in the 1990’s enabled Sri Lanka to significantly

improve the share of manufacturing goods in

total exports, Sri Lanka has been less successful

in diversifying its manufacturing product range

and upgrading from labour-intensive to high-tech

manufacturing exports. As a result, Sri Lanka’s

manufacturing exports continue to be highly

concentrated in textiles and garments while growth

in the export sector, particularly manufacturing

exports, has been dismal in the recent past. While

Sri Lanka’s industrial policies have continued

to focus mainly on promoting final goods for the

export market, the global approach has changed.

Global production networks have come to the

forefront in cross-border trade and production.

This has opened up avenues for countries to

specialise in different stages in the production

process based on their relative cost advantages.

Regional competitors, particularly East and South

East Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, South

Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia,

have dramatically increased their manufacturing

exports through global production networks. India,

which traditionally focused on labour intensive

manufacturing exports, has integrated successfully

with global production networks producing

technology intensive parts and components for

data processing machines, electrical machinery

and semiconductor devices. Conversely, only

a fraction of Sri Lanka’s manufacturing exports

moved through global production networks during

this period. Therefore, Sri Lanka needs to revamp

its industrial policy to facilitate greater integration

of the domestic manufacturing sector with regional

Sri Lanka’s Competitiveness in the Current Context

In an increasingly competitive global market, a country’s national competitiveness depends greatly on its ability to position itself in the global value chain and compete successfully for a higher share in trade in goods and services, investments and human capital, all of which are crucial for a high growth trajectory. As countries compete in an increasingly challenging and demanding global market, country competitiveness has become a central theme of discussion among economists and policymakers, alike, in both advanced and emerging market economies. The World Economic Forum (WEF) defines the competitiveness of a country as ‘the set of institutions, policies and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country’. Growth models suggest that productivity is the most fundamental factor determining the level of prosperity of a country and its citizens in the long run.1

While the three-decade long internal conflict severely hampered Sri Lanka’s competitiveness, years after the ending of the internal conflict, the economy is still experiencing a stagnant external sector performance and low levels of productivity growth, resulting in the economy not being able to fully exploit its potential. The high growth experienced in the recent past stemmed from non-tradable sectors (mainly construction and real estate), which were primarily driven by public sector consumption and investments that are both unsustainable and inequitable. Although Sri Lanka was one of the most open economies in the Asian region during the late 1970s, the inward-focused restrictive trade policy stance of successive governments has resulted in a traditional exports basket of low value added and labour-intensive products for which Sri Lanka faces stiff competition from other low cost developing countries. The low technology content of Sri Lanka’s exports and the low-skill products exported by the country also result in the underutilisation of Sri Lanka’s educated labour force. The strategies adopted by Sri Lanka including the provision of grants, subsidies and tax concessions have not been effective in sustaining the country’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investments (FDI) and exports.

The prevailing weak investment climate in Sri Lanka can be attributed to a range of factors including policy uncertainty, institutional weaknesses such as corruption and weak regulations, and faltering infrastructure.2 This has resulted in Sri Lanka attracting lower volumes of FDI as a percentage of GDP, than its lower middle-income peer economies. This has culminated in the form of limited growth potential, innovation and productivity

BOX 02Improving Sri Lanka’s Competitiveness within Global Markets

of established firms, and the inhibition of start-ups, thus severely curtailing the country’s international competitiveness. Factors such as macroeconomic imbalances, legal and procedural obstacles to foreign investment, lack of consistency in the legal and regulatory framework, and the lack of a well-coordinated mechanism to attract, retain and integrate foreign investments, continue to pose as impediments to Sri Lanka’s ability to entirely benefit from rapidly expanding world trade, thereby resulting in the loss of its market base to its competitors.

The WEF’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) - 2016/17 ranks Sri Lanka as 71st among 138 countries around the world, slipping three notches down from its position in the GCI - 2015/16 ranking. Conversely, regional economies, such as India, Malaysia and Singapore have made remarkable progress in improving their global competitiveness over the past few decades, resulting in these countries ranking at the 39th, 25th and 2nd positions, respectively, in the GCI - 2016/17. Other regional peers, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, are ranked at 122nd, 106th, 98th and 97th positions, respectively. Chart B 2.1 illustrates the performance of Sri Lanka in terms of 12 major determinants of competitiveness against its leading counterparts, Singapore, Malaysia and India.

Considering that the attraction of FDI is a necessary condition for the level of economic diversification that Sri Lanka aspires to achieve, there is a need for robust policy initiatives that will enable Sri Lanka to emerge as a key FDI destination. However, not all FDI is the same and their impact and spillovers in the economy vary significantly. Therefore, the policies and instruments to attract FDI to Sri Lanka should be guided by a clear vision

on the type of FDI that the country pursues. Investment attraction efforts however, are not enough in the absence of a stable foundation. Investors seek a stable investment climate with macroeconomic and political stability in the host country, in addition to the availability of infrastructure and linkages to global markets. Chart B 2.2 highlights the key problematic areas that the business community has identified as hindrances for country competitiveness in the GCI Report - 2016/17. Therefore, the insight offered by global investors can be used in the determination of policy priorities to enhance the country’s investment climate, thus enabling Sri Lanka to attract and retain FDI.

Measures Towards Improving Sri Lanka’s Competitiveness

Today, Sri Lanka is in a dire need of policy initiatives focused at improving its competitiveness so that it may ascend from a ‘lower-middle income economy’ to an ‘upper-middle income economy’ without a considerable delay. In analysing Sri Lanka’s performance in several global competitiveness rankings, the following areas are identified as policy priorities in the reform process to improve the country’s competitiveness in the global arena.

1. The Need for a Consistent, National Development Policy

The existence of a consistent national policy towards development has enabled a number of advanced and emerging economies to compete successfully in the international market by attracting FDI inflows and capturing a substantial share of international trade. However, in the context of Sri Lanka, there is a lack of national development policy consensus as they change from time to time, in line with the agenda of the political parties. However, in order to compete in a global marketplace, it is essential to draft and implement policies over the long term in a consistent and transparent manner, irrespective of the government in power. Policy inconsistency raises vulnerability to market risks, thus deterring investor confidence. This results in low levels of FDI inflows and dampening of domestic investments by the private sector. Hence, to build investor confidence in the domestic economy, it is important to move away from the stop-go

policy culture that was prevalent in the past while having a coherent national development policy, implemented with strong commitment.

2. Improving the Quality of Infrastructure

In recent years, Sri Lanka witnessed a significant improvement in its infrastructure base. However, improving the infrastructure base alone will not improve competitiveness as the quality of services delivered by such infrastructure is a serious concern among potential investors. For example, though Sri Lanka has reached a significantly high level of electrification, the quality of electricity supply is questionable and is not competitively priced. Sri Lanka also holds a low rank in terms of logistics compared to its regional peers in 2014, as measured by the Logistics Performance Index (refer Chart B 2.3). This exhibits the drawbacks of the current infrastructure base. Prospective investors consider such rankings in making their business decisions as the quality and cost of infrastructure affect their profitability. Local manufacturers also experience these difficulties and as a result, business operations are primarily concentrated in the Western Province, where access to infrastructure is high. The government should focus on the development and enhancement of infrastructure within and outside the Western Province in line with its broad national development policy framework, as infrastructure is a key driver of national competitiveness.

3. Bureaucratic Constraints

Bureaucratic constraints are often referred to as an obstacle for effective conduct of private sector businesses. Hence, the government has to facilitate the private sector through less bureaucratic constraints as high compliance costs are a key consideration in the business decisions of the private sector. The presence of excessive bureaucratic procedures in business start-up, enforcement of contracts,

property registration and obtaining credit have also placed Sri Lanka at a significantly disadvantageous position in the ‘Doing Business Index’, when compared to regional peers. Further, the high costs associated with compliance of regulations discourage the creation of new firms, limit the growth of existing firms, induce entrepreneurs to operate informally, limit access to finance and business processes, and paves the way for waste and corruption.

Simplification of existing procedures and associated systems would encourage entrepreneurs to start-up innovative businesses that are capable of evolving into businesses with significant international potential. Although the government has taken several progressive steps towards this end, especially with regard to tax administration and the improvement of public sector efficiencies, rapid reforms are needed in the legal and tax environments of the country.

4. Research and Development (R&D), and Innovation

Innovation and entrepreneurship are key drivers of competitiveness. Accordingly, Sri Lanka should provide impetus to encourage knowledge-intensive enterprises that can successfully develop and sell goods and services with high value addition, in both domestic and global markets. To this end, policy initiatives such as (i) energising export-oriented small and medium enterprises (SMEs); (ii) fast-tracking the formation and scaling of growth-oriented start-ups; and (iii) rationalising and upgrading the R&D sector are key for Sri Lanka. These three strategies require distinct, yet complementary set of policy initiatives that are essential for the economic modernisation process of Sri Lanka and to improve its competitiveness vis-à-vis its competitors in the global economy. To enable export oriented SMEs, it is needed to introduce incentives for technology adoption, develop channels for greater access to supply chains and international markets, strengthen the quality of national infrastructure and address technological skills gaps to enable both traditional and emerging industries. Growth-oriented start-ups are often the source of innovative business models, products and services that can have a transformative economic impact. Having access to seed funding to validate innovative business models, and access to venture capital

to commercialise and expand businesses are crucial for innovations to thrive. Many countries are already ahead in the innovation race by enabling their start-up communities through comprehensive ecosystem approaches. If Sri Lanka wishes to attract and raise regionally or globally oriented start-ups, it must focus on creating a simplified and enabling business environment with a policy mix that promote entrepreneurship and innovation.

Sri Lanka’s investment in R&D is dismally low. Yet, institutions such as the Sri Lanka Institute of Nano Technology (SLINTEC) - a unique Public-Private Partnership, Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), and the University of Moratuwa have all made considerable progress in developing R&D capabilities to deliver value to Sri Lankan enterprises. Sri Lanka should further emulate these practices in the domestic economy to enhance R&D. To cater to the technology adoption by firms, Sri Lanka needs to have a skilled labour force ready. The education policy needs to be reoriented to cater to this need.

Improving Macroeconomic Stability

The uncertainty created by increasing inflation, overvalued real exchange rate, persistent fiscal deficits, high government debt levels and persistent external current account deficits create macroeconomic instability hindering investor confidence. Sri Lanka has maintained low inflation for eight consecutive years, and this has been positively recognised in the GCI - 2016/17. However, Sri Lanka’s competitiveness has been scored poorly in terms of government budget balance, public debt levels and credit ratings. The government has adopted policies to curtail the fiscal deficit by implementing revenue based fiscal consolidation measures to arrest debt accumulation. Lowering the fiscal deficit reduces the need for external financing at high market rates, resulting in mitigating external sector vulnerabilities. In addition, the Central Bank has clearly articulated its exchange rate policy to the public that would also help to build investor confidence. Given that the root cause for current macroeconomic imbalances of Sri Lanka is mostly related to the country’s fiscal performance, the revenue based fiscal consolidation process need to be continued with utmost political commitment.

Way Forward

Sri Lanka has had many missed opportunities to transform itself into a developed nation, and thus, cannot afford to delay any further in regaining competitiveness in the global market. Although the government has recognised this need, the speed at which policies are being implemented should be hastened. To this end, Sri Lanka is in need of a comprehensive action plan that receives the support of all stakeholders. Sustaining and advancing reforms to enhance competitiveness require a strong political commitment, while it is necessary to obtain the support of the public for implementing national plans. To achieve this, changing the mindset of the public is also essential.

and global production networks. Towards this end,

entering into trade agreements with economies

that have increased presence in global production

networks and removal of para-tariff barriers are

crucial in improving cross-border trade and reducing

domestic production costs which could improve

Sri Lanka’s prospects of integrating with global

production networks. Further, human resources

should be adequately trained to meet the increasing

demands of the export manufacturing sector.

Industrial policies need to be well harmonised with

infrastructure development. In addition, ensuring

property rights and strengthening the enforcement

of contracts are important for Sri Lanka to engage

in global production sharing (See Box Article 03:

Towards a Manufacturing Sector Development

Strategy).

A disproportionately large share of the

total labour force in Sri Lanka is engaged in

agriculture related activities, and the sector

is plagued with stagnant productivity, lack of

diversification, land fragmentation, inefficient

water management, poor storage and

marketing mechanisms and climate change

related issues. Protectionist policies in relation to

the agriculture sector have continued to be in place

through the provision of fertiliser subsidies, free

water, minimum farm-gate prices and high import

duties. These policies have discouraged farmers

from moving towards other productive sectors

in the economy while preventing diversification

into more productive cultivation. Agricultural

subsidies, such as those for fertiliser, are fiscally

ineffective, environmentally unsustainable and

economically inefficient. Instead, attention is

required on developing appropriate infrastructure

and institutional facilities that increase productivity

levels in the agriculture sector and develop

effective marketing mechanisms, particularly for

the paddy sector. Farmer organisations must be

strengthened to improve their bargaining power,

to set up processing facilities that are owned and

operated by them and to efficiently market their

final produce. Transforming research knowledge

into farmers’ knowledge is key for improving the

efficiency and productivity of the agriculture sector.

Moreover, extension services should be improved

in all research agencies, including those of tea,

rubber and coconut. Through such services, organic

farming techniques that use no pesticides and less

fertiliser could be promoted while disseminating

knowledge about alternative use of agricultural

byproducts. Agricultural policies should strive to

improve productivity not only at the farmer level

but in the entire value chain, thereby increasing

value addition in the agriculture sector. To this end,

improving storage facilities, enhancing processing

mechanisms for agricultural products and reducing

post-harvest losses are essential aspects that

need to be addressed through collaborative action

of research institutes, extension services and

farmers. Further, policies to increase access to

credit by farmers through the formal financial sector

at reasonable interest rates must be strengthened.

Innovative value addition mechanisms and stronger

marketing strategies are also crucial to boost

agricultural exports. Moreover, priority should be

given for sustainable environmental policies and

practices in all sectors with the long term view of

reducing the adverse effects of climate change on

agriculture and food security.

In spite of the government’s commitment

to fiscal consolidation, fiscal performance

continued to reflect several structural

weaknesses. The key challenge lies in the below

par performance of the government in relation to

revenue collection, which has been insufficient even

to cover the government’s recurrent expenditure.

Despite recent improvements, evidence shows

that Sri Lanka’s poor performance with regard

to revenue collection is largely attributable to

34

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

1

weak tax collection stemming from numerous tax

exemptions, tax avoidance and the weaknesses

in tax administration. On the expenditure front,

interest payments and expenditure on salaries

accounted for over two-thirds of recurrent outlays.

Moreover, the high level of transfer payments

and welfare expenditure continue to weigh on the

government budget. These developments have

resulted in limited fiscal space being available

for the accommodation of other urgent priorities

of the government, thereby creating several

new challenges to the prevailing socioeconomic

environment. Emerging demands of the economy

tend to add further pressure on the budget unless

curtailed or prioritised within the envisaged fiscal

consolidation path. Any deviation of fiscal targets

from the desired levels will create a vicious cycle

of revenue shortfalls, expenditure overruns, high

budget deficits, increase in government debt and

debt service payments, and lower expenditure

on public investment. Therefore, the timely

implementation of essential reforms as outlined

in recent policy documents to revamp budgetary

operations is necessary for the government to

free itself from this vicious cycle. The rising stock

of foreign commercial debt also necessitates the

adoption of a prudent and forward looking approach

towards debt management.

In the context of the relatively low

government revenue to GDP ratio amidst low

tax compliance and a narrow tax base, policy

measures aimed at bringing the informal

economy into the tax net and increasing direct

taxation could yield significant benefits in the

long run. At present, more than 80 per cent of

tax revenue is derived from indirect taxes, such

as VAT and import duties. Indirect taxes distort

optimal resource allocation based on market forces

and affect low-income households adversely,

as most of these taxes are imposed on essential

consumer items, leading to increased income

and expenditure disparities within the economy.

Therefore, the government needs to continuously

focus on strengthening tax collection, particularly

income tax, as it envisages increasing revenue

on a sustainable basis while improving the ratio of

direct to indirect taxes. Furthermore, among many

factors that contributed to the declining trend in tax

revenue as a percentage of GDP observed until the

recent past, tax evasion and avoidance have been

significant. In this context, devising mechanisms

to bring the informal sector, which forms a large

share of GDP, into the tax net could form a useful

source of government revenue in the medium to

long term, although the direct revenue benefits of

taxing the informal sector are likely to be relatively

modest initially mainly due to associated high

administrative costs. Moreover, there is growing

evidence that taxing the informal sector can

enhance the growth of micro, small and medium

scale enterprises (MSMEs). The payment of taxes

by firms in the informal economy may be a method

of engaging firms with the state, thereby promoting

legitimacy and good governance among such

firms, while facilitating increased integration of

such firms with the financial system. Simplification

of the tax structure, expediting dispute resolution

mechanisms and mandatory registration of

businesses are some measures that would help

bring the informal sector to the tax net. The adoption

of policies aimed at increasing voluntary tax

compliance can also be useful in improving informal

sector revenue collection. Moreover, government

tax reforms need to be supported by measures

to bring in all those liable into the tax net, while

streamlining tax procedures to create a taxpayer

friendly environment, which will encourage greater

tax compliance. Transparency in government

spending is also important to demonstrate the

effective use of tax revenue, thereby encouraging

the public to pay taxes.

35

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

While focusing on enhancing tax collection

from income and profits, widening the tax net

on relatively immobile bases such as land and

property would enhance the progressive nature

of the tax structure and support the efforts of

the government to improve revenue from direct

taxes. At present, property taxation in Sri Lanka

consists of the Assessment Tax or rates levied on

immovable property by local authorities and stamp

duty imposed on transactions of property. While

local rates are levied for services rendered by

local authorities, stamp duty revenue is contingent

on the level and value of the property transaction.

Moreover, transaction based taxes such as stamp

duties impose a bias against economic activities.

In this context, imposition of a land value tax,

which is a recurring tax on the unimproved value

of residential land, could provide a predictable and

stable flow of government revenue. A relatively

low tax rate would help the land value tax to be

levied on a broader tax base, while maintenance

of an official valuation database by the government

to guide the determination of property value

could minimise the subjectivity inherent with land

valuation. Furthermore, land value taxes enhance

the progressive nature of the tax structure as higher

value lands are subject to higher taxes. Moreover,

direct taxes that are based on stocks of wealth such

as land and property are relatively less predisposed

to tax evasion than direct taxes that are levied on

flow of wealth such as income taxes. In view of the

above, concerted efforts to implement a broad-

based land value tax is crucial to improve revenue

from direct taxes, as envisaged by the government,

thereby reducing market inefficiencies and income

disparities in the economy.

Better targeting of government subsidy and

transfer programmes is necessary to maximise

their intended benefits in the context of the

limited resource envelope in the fiscal sector.

In the recent past, the government has been

spending around 3-4 per cent of GDP on subsidy

and transfer programmes with the intention of

improving living standards and livelihoods of low

income households and economically vulnerable

segments of the population. Nevertheless, it is often

argued that some government subsidy and transfer

programmes are ineffective in reducing poverty and

inequality because higher income families receive

a large share of benefits under these schemes. For

example, a large fraction of the Samurdhi benefit

receivers may not necessarily belong to the income

group that is targeted by the programme, and it is

expected that the implementation of the Welfare

Benefits Act No. 24 of 2002 after a lag of 14 years

would help streamline the safety net programmes to

a great extent. Moreover, although the government

does not provide direct subsidies for the users of

petroleum products and electricity, the financial

losses made by the SOBEs ultimately become a

burden on the government budget, and thereby

on the general public. With regard to petroleum

pricing, in general, diesel and kerosene users are

cross subsidised by petrol users although diesel

users are not essentially low income earners.

Similarly, households with low electricity usage are

being cross subsidised by high usage households,

but this subsidy does not necessarily target the

low income households. In addition, ineffective

targeting of production subsidies leads to resource

misallocation. For example, the fertiliser subsidy,

which was streamlined during the past two years,

was earlier granted without a targeting mechanism,

and it failed to generate expected benefits to the

economy due to inefficiencies in subsidy distribution

and excessive use of fertiliser. The fertiliser subsidy

provided by successive governments also caused

the continuation of the agriculture sector’s low

productivity, by incentivising a higher fraction of the

labour force to remain in the sector and preventing

36

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

1

the resource reallocation to more productive

sectors. Similar to the recent streamlining of the

fertiliser subsidy, proper targeting of the other

subsidy and transfer programmes is essential

to maximise their intended benefits. Periodic

monitoring of the income status of the recipients

of safety net benefits is necessary. The direct cash

transfer systems could also be extended to cover

consumption subsidies rather than generic product

-wise cross subsidisation in relation to the provision

of public utilities and petroleum products.

The sustainability of the public sector

pension scheme needs to be ensured taking

into consideration the rising fiscal burden

due to population ageing and the significant

increase in the size of the public service over

the last 12 years, while encouraging market

oriented pension and superannuation schemes

to meet the needs of the overall labour force.

It can be argued that the current pension scheme

constitutes a fiscal time-bomb, which will place

a massive burden on future generations. Sri

Lanka's unfunded public service pension liabilities

could become a significant fiscal burden in the

context of accelerating population ageing and

the increase in the size of the public service. The

rise in the number of pensioners amidst gradually

ageing population and increasing life expectancy,

and increasing pension allowances are exerting

significant pressure on recurrent expenditure of the

government. As the government pays its pension

obligations out of recurrent expenditure rather than

from a separate fund to which it has contributed

over time, there is no clear understanding of the

exact pension liability of the government. It is

imperative, therefore, to estimate the future pension

liability of the government. Such estimations are

also recommended under international statistical

methodologies including Government Finance

Statistics (GFS) standards of the IMF. In many

advanced economies, the outstanding public sector

pension liabilities are estimated to be more than

100 per cent of GDP. Taking into consideration

the magnitude of pension liabilities, governments

in advanced economies, as well as emerging

market economies, have set up pension funds

so that returns from investment of assets in the

pension fund will pay the pension obligations for

the foreseeable future. Given the rapidly changing

demographic profile and the substantial increase

in the size of the public sector, it is essential that

Sri Lanka also sets up a pension fund urgently,

as envisaged by the government. Another step

to improve the sustainability of the public sector

pension scheme would be to gradually increase

the retirement age of government employees.

Meanwhile, with regard to the majority of the

labour force, who are working in the formal and

informal private sector, the challenge of an ageing

population needs to be addressed with a long

term focus through strengthening the retirement

benefit schemes and reforming the health sector.

In particular, it is necessary to enable the financial

market to develop sustainable pension, insurance

and superannuation products with a long term view

supported by targeted fiscal incentives, in spite

of the fact that the current market interest rate

structure has dampened the immediate demand

for such products.

The effective implementation of necessary

restructuring programmes to address already

identified issues and challenges faced by

the SOBEs and considering the options for

divestiture of non strategic and underutilised

state assets are of paramount importance

to ensure fiscal sustainability in the medium

to long term. Sri Lanka’s fiscal performance is

affected by the significant amount of accumulated

losses of SOBEs, while weak financial positions of

large SOBEs could also have a detrimental impact

37

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

on the banking sector of the country. Therefore,

causes behind such weaknesses of SOBEs need

to be addressed through the implementation of the

recently drafted statements of corporate intent in

order to revive these entities. The implementation of

a formula based pricing for SOBEs, particularly for

those dealing with energy related products, would

minimise the macroeconomic impact of future

global energy price fluctuations. Adopting cost

reflective pricing mechanisms would strengthen

the commercial viability of SOBEs, while setting

up a mechanism to transparently pass the effects

of global price variations to domestic users.

Meanwhile, the adoption of the PPP model for the

operation of certain SOBEs would help ease the

fiscal burden as PPPs can induce crowding in of

private sector investment. Further, successful PPPs

infuse new technology and management knowhow

leading to more effective and efficient service

provisioning with an enhanced value proposition

in the offering. Meanwhile, divestment of non

strategic state assets, such as hotels, would allow

greater government focus on key SOBEs. Allowing

foreign equity infusions to non strategic and/or

underutilised state assets would also strengthen

the external sector of the country. It is also

necessary to encourage concentration of private

sector-led commercial activities around the already

built infrastructure, thereby catalysing economic

development. Reforms in SOBEs, however, should

be undertaken within the country’s socio-economic

context, particularly by clearly communicating the

rationale behind such actions to the stakeholders

and the general public through appropriate public

consultation processes.

Continued investment in physical

infrastructure is essential to sustain the growth

momentum of the economy, and alternative

funding arrangements for such investment

must be sought actively. Although the quality

and availability of physical infrastructure have

improved markedly in the post-conflict era,

continued investment in new infrastructure and the

maintenance of existing infrastructure are essential

as the demand for all types of infrastructure will

increase in tandem with rising income levels and

urbanisation trends. Infrastructure financing has

traditionally been dominated by the public sector.

However, considering the limited fiscal space, it is

imperative to encourage private sector investments

in infrastructure development. International

experience shows that subsectors of infrastructure,

such as toll roads, public transportation, power

generation and distribution, telecommunication,

ports, water supply and treatment, and garbage

disposal have the potential of being attractive

opportunities for private investment. Sri Lanka

is also yet to fully realise the benefits of PPPs,

in spite of the success of early PPPs in sectors,

such as telecommunication, ports, aviation and

energy. In recognition of the fact that PPPs are an

essential means of attracting private investment in

infrastructure, several policy measures have been

taken to create an enabling environment for PPPs

to thrive. Addressing the remaining regulatory

and institutional gaps, seen in the forms of policy

inconsistencies and lack of domestic capacity in

aspects related to planning and project design,

feasibility studies and project implementation, as

well as increasing the awareness of the public

and the existing workforce in these sectors,

would increase the attractiveness of PPPs. Active

engagement with multilateral development banks

must continue as these institutions not only bring

financial assistance but also advanced technologies

and technical skills while drawing upon their vast

international experience to distil good practice.

Supporting further deepening of the financial

sector is imperative to promote economic

growth, reduce poverty and inequality,

38

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

enhance resilience of economic agents to

minimise the effects of shocks, and to improve

macroeconomic policy effectiveness. Over

time, the global financial sector has evolved rapidly

into state-of-the-art multi-faceted financial systems

to include an assortment of banks, mutual funds,

venture capital firms, insurance companies and

many other types of non-bank financial institutions.

These developments have facilitated economic

agents to diversify savings and raise funds for

productive purposes. The efficiency of and access

to these financial services help shape the level and

rate of increase in economic prosperity. However,

in the Sri Lankan context, the less advanced

debt markets and private equity and venture

capital industries remain a serious concern

in spite of continued efforts by successive

governments to develop such markets and

industries. As the Sri Lankan economy expands,

substantial improvements in currency, derivatives

and commodities markets are necessary to

accommodate complex financial instruments

developed within a dynamic regulatory regime

setup based on international best practices. At

the same time, the development of deep and

liquid corporate debt and equity markets over

the medium term is essential, through increased

market participation of both local and foreign

investors. Moreover, economically backward

and marginalised regions should also be actively

integrated into the mainstream financial system,

through which their specific unmet needs such as

easy access to finance should also be taken into

consideration.

The country’s imminent graduation to

an upper middle income economy also

necessitates rethinking of financial sector

consolidation, with emphasis on non-bank

financial institutions and small state banks, to

build a strong and dynamic financial sector.

At present, Sri Lanka has 46 LFCs and 7 SLCs

in addition to the 32 licensed banks, within the

financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank.

The large disparity in size of these institutions, and

the presence of a large number of small institutions

has made regulation and supervision complex,

while making them less resilient to shocks, thereby

undermining financial system stability. Encouraging

market driven financial sector consolidation will

enable financial institutions to mobilise funds from

the international market, leverage on the scale

of operations, upgrade technology to strengthen

efficiency and thus reduce intermediation costs,

while strengthening their resilience. The enhanced

capital requirements are expected to encourage

small and medium sized banks to merge in the

medium term, whilst the small state owned banks,

five of which account for only around 2.5 per cent

of banking sector assets, are expected to merge

with larger banks to enable them to contribute

to the economy in a more meaningful manner.

Concurrently, the regulatory and supervisory

framework is also expected to be strengthened

further.

The envisaged shift to a Flexible Inflation

Targeting (FIT) framework to conduct monetary

policy will require addressing the remaining

barriers to its successful adoption. The success

of inflation targeting depends on increased central

bank independence, improved public perception

of the ability of a central bank to contain inflation,

and enhanced efficiency in monetary policy

transmission. Globally, the legal framework for

inflation targeting provides substantial autonomy

to central banks in the conduct of monetary policy,

with provisions for enhanced transparency and

accountability. In the context of Sri Lanka, the

Monetary Law Act mandates the Central Bank of

Sri Lanka to achieve economic and price stability

in the conduct of monetary policy, while providing

a considerable level of institutional independence.

However, as the Central Bank of Sri Lanka moves

39

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

towards FIT, the related legal and institutional

frameworks need to be further strengthened,

supported by continued efforts towards fiscal

consolidation. Central bank legal frameworks in

many emerging market economies including all

inflation targeters, explicitly limit or prohibit financing

of budget deficits, as monetisation of such deficits

could induce inflationary pressures. In this regard,

while facilitating price discovery, it is necessary

to revamp the current system of raising funds for

the government under a purely auction based

system where direct placements are made only

with the Central Bank. Such revamping could also

help address some distortions currently observed

in monetary policy transmission by allowing the

containment of speculative behaviour of market

participants without a cost to the Central Bank, and

thereby on the general public. It may also be useful

to develop instruments to influence the longer end

of the yield curve, which appears to be as volatile

as its shorter end in response to short term policy

adjustments, in underdeveloped financial markets

such as in Sri Lanka. In the meantime, as Sri Lanka

adopts inflation targeting by moving away from

money growth and the exchange rate as traditional

anchors for inflation, management of inflation

expectations has become extremely important in

maintaining low and stable inflation, particularly in

the context of allowing the exchange rate to adjust

to reflect a competitive REER.

While the efficacy of demand management

policies are being improved, emphasis on

policies aimed at managing the supply side

is equally important to ensure that the effects

stemming from disturbances to the supply

of essential goods do not result in excessive

volatility in domestic consumer prices. Supply

shortages stemming from weather related

developments and shocks that could arise due

to possible reversal of global commodity prices

could result in temporary variations in price levels,

which have the potential to translate into second

round inflationary and BOP pressures. Therefore,

it is important that the government adopts relevant

short and long term measures to counter adverse

supply side effects on domestic prices, while

taking necessary policy actions to curb imported

inflation emanating from external shocks. As the

extent of land available for the expansion of food

crop cultivation is limited, short term measures are

required for enhancing crop productivity to ensure

food security in the medium term. Moreover, the

yields of certain domestically grown food crops

have stagnated at unimpressive levels for many

years. Therefore, yield potential requires a further

increase with varieties having higher efficiencies

and resistance to biotic stresses (pests, diseases)

as well as abiotic stresses (drought, nutrient

deficiency). Meanwhile, strengthening the linkage

between financial markets and the agriculture

sector, and popularising financial products, such as

forward contracts, are crucial factors to improve the

supply side of the economy. Further, promotion of

commercial agriculture, as already mooted by the

government, would help strengthen the supply side

through increased production with mechanisation

of farm operations, product quality management

and efficient soil health management.

The increased occurrence of weather

related disturbances arising from climate

change has made policymaking complex,

warranting enhanced disaster preparedness

to mitigate the impact of such disturbances

on all sectors of the economy. In the past few

years, monsoons not only failed to bring sufficient

rainfall but the distribution of rainfall was also highly

concentrated over a very short period, increasing

the severity of the drought as well as floods and

landslides across the country. Consequences

of these changes in climatic conditions were felt

in the production and prices of food crops, water

supply for drinking, irrigation and hydropower

40

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

1

generation. Hence, proactive policy measures

with a medium and long term view are required to

mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. In

the agriculture sector, water use efficiency should

be enhanced while drought tolerant and high-yield

paddy varieties must be promoted. Crop insurance

schemes among farming communities could be

promoted as a risk transfer mechanism. In addition,

maintaining rolling buffer stocks for main food

grains is required to enable uniform distribution

of food supplies across the country at a fairly

stable price. Moreover, incentives would also be

required to promote non conventional renewable

energy sources such as solar energy systems to

reduce reliance on mainstream power generation.

In order to minimise the effects of weather related

disruptions to livelihoods of the population, the

disaster monitoring and management mechanisms

must be strengthened with the participation of

regional level public officials and international

development agencies.

Sri Lanka’s general education policy has to

be reoriented to meet the dynamic requirements

of a middle income economy. The continued

government investment in education has helped the

expansion of the country’s human capital base. The

provision of universal education has helped attain

a literacy rate of 93.2 per cent, high completion

rates in both primary and secondary education,

and gender parity in general education. However,

most of the economic benefits from investment

in education are derived from student learning

rather than years of schooling completed. Since

skills formation is a cumulative life cycle process

that proceeds in stages with each building on the

previous one, poor achievement in basic cognitive

skills can affect the success of post-primary

education, including the ability to acquire job-

specific skills. This reiterates the need to improve

the quality and relevance of pre-school, primary

and secondary education to ensure that students

have a solid foundation in science and technology,

numeracy, languages, and literacy. This will help

in the creation of a more trainable and flexible

labour force. There is scope to improve the quality

of learning through pedagogical interventions that

directly address barriers to learning stemming

from constraints faced by schools and teachers in

improving the classroom environment. This may

include improvement of the effectiveness of lessons,

revision of the curriculum and method of delivery,

provision of additional material, introduction of

new technology and improvement of the quality of

teachers through training, incentives and changes

to recruitment practices. The quality of education

is conditioned by the quality of teachers, thereby

making it essential for policymakers to develop

long term strategies to popularise teaching as a

profession amongst high performing graduates.

International research has demonstrated that the

quality of principals is an important determinant of

the success of schools in delivering good learning

outcomes. Special attention should therefore, be

paid to upgrade the state of school principals. In

addition, studies show that despite the provision of

free education, people from poorer backgrounds

had fewer years of education than their higher

income counterparts, and those who live in rural

areas had lower educational attainment, highlighting

the presence of significant inequalities in education

and training for the poor and those living in rural

areas. Further, inequities arising in service delivery

of public schools have resulted in excessive

demand for placements in popular schools while

resources in others remain underutilised. While

recent government policies to promote the quality

and attractiveness of peripheral schools are

commendable, the success of such policies is yet

to be realised. Furthermore, the increasing role

of private schools in fulfilling the excess demand

for school placements in urban areas need to

be facilitated while ensuring the quality and

uniformity in service provision as a large majority

41

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

of these schools do not fall under the purview of

any regulatory body. The operation of sub-optimal

education institutions can result in pockets of the

population significantly lagging behind their peers,

despite having incurred a significant financial cost.

Several issues arise as a result of

increased demand for higher education in a

system dominated by the public sector, while

mismatches between the needs of the economy

and the output of the higher education system

persist. Limited capacity of public universities

has prevented all eligible GCE Advanced Level

students from being admitted to such institutions.

In 2016, despite 155,550 students being eligible to

be admitted to state universities, only 18.6 per cent

of those eligible gained admission to the university

system. This problem of inadequate access to

higher education locally will continue to hinder the

optimal development and use of human resources

required for the country’s future. Considering

the limited fiscal space, it is vital to encourage

private higher education institutions to expand

their service provision. Private sector participation

is unlikely to create inequities in access to

higher education as a sizable portion of students

who possess the financial capacity continue to

pursue higher education abroad while incurring a

significant foreign exchange cost to the economy.

Despite the fact that increased participation of

private educational institutes is essential to fill

supply gaps, the quality of education provided

by such institutes should not be compromised. In

this context, strengthening the higher education

quality assurance and accreditation framework to

cover public and private higher education could

play a significant role in standardising the services

offered by such institutes while ensuring that

all beneficiaries receive a high quality learning

experience. This would also encourage healthy

competition between higher educational institutions,

paving the way for them to become world class

universities in future. It is important for policy to be

based on a pragmatic approach to public, private

and mixed provision of education. Meanwhile,

Sri Lanka’s competitiveness will greatly hinge on

higher education and training in its transition from

factor-driven to efficiency-driven development. The

presence of major skills shortages and mismatches

will erode productivity and weaken the prospects for

growth. Sector-wide skills assessments highlight

lack of sufficient cognitive, technical and soft skills

among graduates, which not only affects their

employability but also results in underemployment.

Focused interventions are required to improve the

quality and relevance of undergraduate as well as

technical education programmes so that the skills

gap prevalent in key value-adding industries can

be bridged. Meanwhile, considering the low level

of investment in research and development (R&D),

tertiary institutions could play a more proactive

role, in partnership with the private sector, in

conducting more R&D that is aligned with industrial

needs. Strengthening postgraduate academic

programmes across a wide range of disciplines

can also help promote R&D while helping domestic

tertiary education institutions to gain international

recognition. This marks the need for a clear policy

direction to leverage the higher education sector to

develop a highly skilled and competent labour force

that will drive Sri Lanka’s transition to an upper

middle income economy.

Despite universal health coverage,

the ongoing epidemiological transition

poses varied challenges, which need to

be addressed through the development of

sustainable healthcare improvement strategies.

Commitment to universal health coverage by

successive governments helped Sri Lanka to

make significant strides in the achievement of

several health indicators outlined in the Millennium

Development Goals (MDGs). However, the

ongoing demographic and economic transition

42

poses several new challenges. The increase in

average life expectancy, increased urbanisation

and the resultant transition to more sedentary

lifestyles have made the population increasingly

vulnerable to Non Communicable Diseases (NCD),

which are the largest contributor to the disease

burden of the country. Due to their chronic nature,

NCDs are relatively expensive to cure resulting

in a large portion of NCD care being financed by

out-of-pocket spending, which can be extremely

burdening, particularly for the poor. Meanwhile,

the rapidly ageing population would also pose a

burden to the public healthcare system as they

tend to require more expensive long term geriatric

treatment. On the other end of the population

spectrum, Sri Lanka faces significant concerns

related to child nutrition across a range of standard

indicators such as rates of anaemia, low birth

weight and underweight children, including stunting

and wasting. Nutrition levels during the first 1,000

days of an infant’s life are crucial determinants of

cognitive capacity. This places a high premium on

good nutrition for pre- and post-natal mothers and

their infants. Despite universal health coverage,

inequality in health outcomes are prevalent across

the country due to regional disparities in public

health service delivery. Therefore, a multipronged

approach has to be adopted to provide the required

assistance to lagging regions and to strengthen

the delivery of public services to sustain ‘universal

health coverage’ status. The government must also

consider improving the accreditation system of

public and private healthcare providers as it would

improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of

organisations providing healthcare services.

In the context of rapid urbanisation in Sri

Lanka, waste management has increasingly

become challenging, requiring the introduction

of low cost solutions with minimal environmental

impact involving private sector participation. A

recent World Bank study on infrastructure services

found that investment in waste management yielded

a higher potential rate of return among infrastructure

projects. At present, a substantial amount of solid

waste is generated daily within the municipality areas,

while the Western Province accounts for a major

share of solid waste generated in the country. While

emphasising the need to reduce, reuse and recycle,

careful attention needs to be given to waste disposal,

i.e., resource recovery, incineration and landfill.

Although several measures have been introduced to

transform open dumping into recycling, composting

and mass-scale processing, a substantial amount of

waste reaches landfills daily. Given the scarcity of land,

Sri Lanka needs to explore other options available

in solid waste management. Waste-to-energy is a

process of generating energy in the form of electricity

and heat from the primary treatment of waste and

is part of the non-hazardous waste management

hierarchy. Not only can this process create a source

of renewable energy, but it could also help reduce

carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy

from fossil sources as well as reduce methane

generation from landfills. Furthermore, the heat

generated from this process could be repurposed for

economic activities. It has been found that waste-to-

energy incineration process results in lower emission

of carbon dioxide, in comparison with a substantially

higher amount of methane gas generated from solid

waste in landfill. In addition, the ash generated from

the incineration process is rich in heavy metals

and may be used to extract secondary resources

such as iron, aluminium, copper, zinc and other

metals from its residue. The US Energy Information

Administration data shows that one metric ton of

municipal solid waste generates 481 kilowatt-hours

(kWh) of electricity, on average, which is equivalent to

electricity consumed by over 200 average Sri Lankan

households in a day. Hence, exploring opportunities

to convert waste-to-energy would not only support

municipal solid waste management, but would also

form an alternative source of renewable energy.

Although Sri Lanka has been ahead of its

regional counterparts in achieving the MDGs,

renewed challenges could be expected in

achieving the more broad-based Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs) by the target year

of 2030 whilst moving towards a higher growth

trajectory. In addition to issues covered by MDGs

such as extreme poverty, gender equality and

universal primary education, SDGs seek to address

several other modern-day challenges such as

human-induced climate change, loss of biodiversity,

poor governance and corruption. Therefore, SDGs

are particularly relevant to Sri Lanka in the context

of the increased pace of growth in the post-conflict

era as they revolve around the creation of a

development process through the sustainable use

of resources by a peaceful and inclusive society. In

addition, despite the country’s success in achieving

MDGs, inequalities that prevail particularly across

regions and income levels, remain a continuing

development challenge despite heavy government

involvement in the provision of universal education

and health, high levels of literacy and progress

towards gender parity. In this context, aligning

development policies with SDGs can be beneficial

to the growth process of the country and help

overcome the challenges associated with rising

incomes, changing consumer lifestyles, population

ageing, urbanisation and the overall transition

towards an upper middle income economy,

especially in terms of addressing geographical

and income-related disparities and environmental

conservation. The pursuit of SDGs will also

complement the stance of the government to

improve economic freedom that will support wider

socioeconomic participation and create a cycle of

inclusive growth, enabling all stakeholders not only

to benefit from the growth process but also actively

contribute to it (See CBSL Annual Report 2015,

Box Article 02: The Socioeconomic Challenges

of Poverty, Income Inequality and Child Under-

nutrition in Sri Lanka).

The structural challenges faced by the Sri

Lankan economy, including those discussed

above, have been consistently highlighted

by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in its

previous Annual Reports and regular reports

to the government, and also by the research

community and international development

agencies on numerous occasions in the

past. Along with strengthening macroeconomic

fundamentals through improved fiscal performance

and the conduct of monetary policy in a forward

looking framework, it is essential that these structural

issues are addressed decisively without delay with

broad public consensus, as the postponement of

these essential reforms is no longer feasible if the

country is to progress along a sustainable and

equitable growth trajectory.
