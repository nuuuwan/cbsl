5.1 OverviewS

ri Lanka’s external sector continued to be under pressure in 2016, characterised by modest foreign exchange inflows

and higher outflows. The pressure experienced

in the external sector was a reflection of global as

well as domestic developments. On the external

front, monetary policy normalisation in the United

States, slow pace of economic growth in advanced

economies such as the European Union and

Japan, and geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle

East impacted adversely on Sri Lanka’s Balance

of Payments (BOP). On the domestic sphere, lack

of substantial foreign investment inflows, higher

import demand, outflows on account of debt service

payments and outflows from the government

securities market posed a challenge towards

external sector stability during the year.

The BOP in 2016 reflected the subdued

performance of the external sector with a

widening of the current account deficit and a

moderation in the financial account. The current

account deficit in 2016 increased marginally to 2.4

per cent of GDP from 2.3 per cent in the previous

year. The trade deficit expanded during the year

with an increase in import expenditure, particularly

with the higher domestic demand for investment

goods, while earnings from merchandise exports

contracted with the drop in both international

commodity prices and export volumes. The deficit

in the primary income account also widened during

the year as a result of the decline in earnings from

reserve assets and continued interest payments

amidst outflows on account of reinvested earnings

and dividend payments. However, the adverse

impact of the trade deficit and the primary income

account deficit was dampened to some extent

by the surpluses in the services account and the

secondary income account. The surplus in the

services account continued to increase, particularly

with higher earnings from tourism, while the

secondary income account benefitted from the

moderate expansion in workers’ remittances in

2016. Meanwhile, the financial account continued to

experience higher outflows amidst modest inflows

by way of non-debt creating sources. In particular,

lower levels of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI)

and capital outflows arising from disinvestment of

government securities by non-residents together

with continued debt service payments, adversely

impacted the financial account in 2016. The lack of

non-debt creating inflows to the financial account

and the widening of the current account deficit

necessitated financing from the rest of the world.

Accordingly, the funding requirement of the BOP

was met through the issuance of an International

Sovereign Bond (ISB) and syndicated loans,

while a three year Extended Fund Facility (EFF)

arrangement with the International Monetary

Fund (IMF) was availed to strengthen the external

sector. These developments in 2016, resulted in

the overall balance of the BOP recording a deficit

of US dollars 500 million. Gross official reserves

also declined to US dollars 6.0 billion by end 2016,

which was equivalent to 3.7 months of imports.

The developments in the external accounts in

2016 were reflected through heightened pressure

in the exchange rate. The exchange rate, which

was maintained at relatively stable levels during the

first half of 2016 with the support from the supply of

foreign exchange liquidity, depreciated at a higher rate

during the second half due to the gradual curtailment

of foreign exchange supply by the Central Bank. A

substantial amount of foreign exchange provided

by the Central Bank in the second half of the year

was to partially ease exchange rate pressure arising

from capital outflows from the government securities

market, following the US rate hike due to portfolio

rebalancing by non-resident investors. During the year

as a whole, the rupee recorded a depreciation of 3.83

per cent against the US dollar over the depreciation

of 9.03 per cent in 2015. However, the Real Effective

Exchange Rate (REER) indices remained above

100 indicating the need of further adjustment to the

exchange rate to be competitive in the international

market.

The mismatch in the demand for and supply

of foreign exchange emphasises the need for

urgent policy measures to address imbalances

in the external sector. Restoring external sector

stability in a challenging environment requires the

building up of external buffers with policies to reduce

spill-over effects from adverse developments in

other sectors. As such, in addition to allowing the

exchange rate to be determined through market

forces by aligning it with the movement of REER

indices, short to medium term measures are

required to strengthen the level of international

reserves. Short term measures in building reserves

would entail reliance on debt-related sources, such

as ISB issuances and foreign exchange swap

arrangements. However, these measures need to

be supplemented through foreign inflows, such as

increased earnings from merchandise and services

exports and FDIs to ensure the external stability on

a sustainable basis. There is a need to formulate a

comprehensive export strategy so as to focus on

the diversification of the export base, integration

into the global production sharing chains while

harnessing the potential to enter global markets

through preferential trade agreements. Improving

the country’s competitiveness, maintaining

policy consistency, improving institutional setup

and the prioritisation of export promotion in the

development agenda is crucial to the creation of a

more conducive environment for exporters. At the

same time, policy initiatives to harness the country’s

potential as a service exporter, in the areas of

Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), Knowledge

Process Outsourcing (KPO), tourism and maritime

services are crucial to the improvement of the

country’s share of exports in the global market. A

multi-pronged policy initiative is also essential to

encourage the attraction of much needed FDI, as

non-debt creating inflows are vital to address the

chronic BOP issue faced by the economy over

several decades.

5.2 External Trade Policies, Developments and Institutional Support

Sri Lanka’s external trade policy focused

on achieving a higher integration with global

markets, by encouraging external trade and

international investments to leverage trade

investment nexus. This is to be achieved by

enhancing market access for Sri Lanka’s exports,

by entering into preferential trade agreements

(PTAs) and free trade agreements (FTAs)

with different trading partners, strategic trade

promotions and by introducing a coherent national

trade policy. National trade policy should focus on

market expansion, trade and tariff rationalisation,

trade facilitation and attracting export oriented

foreign direct investments to expand the export

base and improve Sri Lanka's competitiveness in

terms of exports and FDI. Anticipated reforms and

measures taken for trade facilitation are expected

to boost Sri Lanka's share of exports in global

markets, driving the growth momentum of the Sri

Lankan economy.

The government has recognised the

importance of removing prevailing obstacles for

external trade in order to promote exports. In this

regard, initiatives were taken to regain the European

Union’s Generalised System of Preferences plus

(EU-GSP+) facility, which was suspended in

August 2010 and to adhere to the international

rules on fisheries, for the lifting of the ban imposed

by the European Commission (EC) on fish exports

to the EU. The Department of Commerce (DOC),

after a series of consultations and review meetings

with the EU and local stakeholders, along with

the Inter Ministerial Sub-Committee on Regaining

the EU-GSP+ facility, prepared a comprehensive

report covering all relevant information on the

compliance and the progress made with respect

to 27 international conventions specified under the

EU-GSP+ regulations. The application for regaining

the EU-GSP+ facility and the comprehensive

report, along with all supporting annexures,

were submitted to the EC in July 2016. After a

thorough review process, in January 2017, the EC

proposed to reinstate the EU-GSP+ in exchange

of Sri Lanka's commitment to ratify and effectively

implement 27 international conventions related

to human rights, labour rights, protection of the

environment and good governance, while allowing

the EU Parliament to raise any potential objections

within a period of 4 months. In addition, as a result

of strong efforts made by the government, the ban

imposed in October 2014, with effect from January

2015, on fisheries exports from Sri Lanka to the

EU, under Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated

(IUU) fishing regulations, was lifted in June 2016.

As the EU market is one of the major seafood

exporting destinations for Sri Lanka, this can be

cited as a significant step towards promoting Sri

Lankan seafood exports. Since the removal of the

ban, seafood exports to the EU grew by 110 per

cent, year-on-year, during the second half of 2016.

The Generalised System of Preferences

(GSP) facilities mainly offered by the USA and

the EU continued in 2016. The GSP offered

by the USA, which provides duty free entry into

the USA for nearly 5,000 products, from 122

beneficiary countries, including Sri Lanka, was

re-authorised in June 2015 and will be valid until

31 December 2017. Sri Lanka, along with other

beneficiaries, submitted a request to the USA to

expand the duty-free treatment for travel goods for

all GSP beneficiary countries, which is expected to

be allowed in 2017. Further, Sri Lanka continued

to benefit from the standard EU-GSP, where Sri

Lanka’s exporters gain concessional duty access

to the EU for about 7,200 products. Meanwhile,

Sri Lanka’s exports under the agreement on the

Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP),1

which is an agreement among developing

countries, marginally declined to US dollars 45

million in 2016 compared to US dollars 49 million in

2015. Under GSTP, Sri Lanka exported cinnamon

as the major export, mainly to Mexico and Peru.

Sri Lanka also benefitted through GSP schemes

granted by several other countries, including Japan

and Norway. Earnings from exports under all GSP

schemes increased by 9.0 per cent to US dollars

3,394 million in 2016. Although preferential access

to high income countries is available through

several GSP facilities, the significantly narrow

export base prevents Sri Lanka from reaping the

full benefit of these schemes.

Identifying the need to tap into the global

value chains (GVCs), improve value addition,

enhance market access and innovation as

the way forward, the government has been

proactive in pursuing trade agreements with

key potential markets, including Singapore,

China, Japan, South Korea, Bangladesh and the

growing markets in Africa. The Memorandum of

Understanding (MOU) on initiating the negotiations

of the China-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement

(CSFTA) was signed in September 2014. The

CSFTA covers trade in goods and services,

investment, and economic and technical cooperation.

1 GSTP is an agreement among developing countries, and established in 1989. It is a tariff preferential scheme negotiated under the aegis of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), with a view to increasing South - South trade and economic cooperation.

Further, Sri Lanka and Singapore, in June 2016,

announced that both countries are keen to pursue

a comprehensive FTA. This FTA expects to focus

on export led growth, employment generation,

expanding market to attract investments with

technical know-how and expertise, and the usage of

supply chain linkages of both countries. A feasibility

study carried out by both parties was followed by

a scoping mission from Singapore in July 2016, for

initial discussions with relevant institutions on the

scope and coverage of the proposed FTA. The first

three rounds of negotiations were held in 2016.

FTAs with both China and Singapore are expected

to be finalised during 2017. Meanwhile, the 12th

council meeting of the Trade and Investment

Framework Agreement (TIFA) between the

USA and Sri Lanka was held in April 2016 in

Washington DC, USA. During the deliberation,

the two governments adopted a US-Sri Lanka

Joint Action Plan, which focused on reforming Sri

Lanka’s trade and investment regime to match with

world standards, improving the competitiveness of

Sri Lanka’s current exports and developing new

markets to boost trade and investment between Sri

Lanka and the USA over a period of five years. An

inter-sessional TIFA Council meeting was held in

September 2016 in Colombo, with the agreement

of a wide-ranging implementation plan, mainly to

support Sri Lanka's goal to serve as a regional

services hub.

While initiatives were taken to enter into

new trade agreements, several measures

were implemented to further rationalise the

utilisation of existing bilateral trade agreements.

Continuous evaluations on developments of FTAs,

PTAs and Comprehensive Economic Partnership

Agreements (CEPAs), with countries that have an

impact on Sri Lanka’s trade, were collaboratively

carried out by the Ministry of Development

Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT),

DOC and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce

(MOIC). As a result, many review meetings were

conducted to address issues arising from FTAs,

PTAs and CEPAs, while Joint Commissions were

established with countries, such as Russia, Iran,

Belarus, Turkey and Bangladesh, to improve

bilateral trade relations. Sri Lanka’s exports

to India, under the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade

Agreement (ISFTA), amounted to US dollars 375

million in 2016 compared to US dollars 407 million

in 2015. The ISFTA is expected to be reinforced

through the inclusion of the services sector and by

creating more investment opportunities through the

proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation

Agreement (ETCA). Both the DOC and MODSIT

conducted stakeholder consultations before the

preliminary official level discussions that were

started in August 2016, where the two parties

had only explored the broader scope of ETCA

and the areas that would be considered within

the framework. A second round of discussions

were held in September 2016 where both sides

agreed on the importance of Mutual Recognition

Agreements (MRAs) on trade in goods and trade in

services. Negotiations on the ETCA are expected

to deepen the current ISFTA on goods, technology

cooperation, economic cooperation, liberalising

services and investments. The agreement is

expected to be finalised in 2017. Meanwhile, the 6th

technical level meeting with regard to the Pakistan-

Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA) was

held in January 2016 in Colombo, where both

parties discussed to revisit the concession lists

under the PSFTA, with a view to pursuing a holistic

liberalisation approach. As a result, some of the

trade barriers on discriminatory import valuation

were removed. However, Sri Lankan exports to

Pakistan under the PSFTA continued to be low

at US dollars 52 million in 2016, in comparison

to US dollars 59 million in 2015. Lack of product

diversification and customs issues can be cited as

main reasons for this situation.

International trade under GVCs and product

sharing networks is increasingly becoming

important, highlighting the greater need for

regional and multilateral trade agreements. In

the context of regional trade agreements, the first

phase of the trade liberalisation programme (TLP)

of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) was

completed by Sri Lanka in November 2015 and

during the second phase of the TLP, members

are expected to reduce their initial sensitive lists

by at least 20 per cent by 2020, with Sri Lanka

scheduled to complete it by 2018. The total value

of exports from Sri Lanka under the SAFTA

declined by 67.4 per cent to US dollars 8 million

in 2016, with 60 per cent of exports to India, while

black pepper and aluminium products were the

major items exported. The South Asia Association

for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Agreement

on Trade in Services (SATIS), as a further step

towards expanding the regional trade in services, is

in the process of finalising the national schedules of

commitments, while the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers was received for Sri Lanka’s Schedule of

Specific Commitments under SATIS in June 2016.

The Standing Committee of Asia-Pacific Trade

Agreement (APTA) gathered for the 49th session,

which was held in September 2016 in Thailand,

where a roadmap for the implementation of

the framework agreement on trade facilitation,

investments and services was discussed. The

APTA, which was earlier known as the Bangkok

Agreement when it was signed in 1975, is the

oldest preferential trade agreement among

developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region,

with Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, South Korea,

Mongolia and Sri Lanka as member countries.

Exports under the APTA increased by 5.9 per cent

to US dollars 126 million in 2016, with black tea,

coconut products and selected garments as major

export items. Among the APTA members, China and

South Korea were the main markets for Sri Lanka,

accounting for about 72 per cent and 25 per cent

of total exports, respectively, under this agreement.

The second ministerial level economic and business

conference of the Indian Ocean Rim Association

(IORA), a regional forum among countries of the

Indian Ocean Rim, was held in April 2016 in Dubai,

while the 16th Council of Ministers and associated

meetings were held in October 2016 in Indonesia.

The TLP related to Sri Lanka on the Bay of Bengal

Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic

Cooperation (BIMSTEC) was approved by the

Cabinet of Ministers in February 2016.

Sri Lanka continued to engage in multilateral

initiatives of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

The 10th WTO Ministerial Conference was held in Kenya

in December 2015, outlining the package known as the

“WTO Nairobi Package”. The future plan of the WTO

was also adopted at the end of the conference. Sri Lanka

became the 81st member to ratify the Trade Facilitation

Agreement (TFA) with the WTO in May 2016, which

will enable Sri Lanka to improve its competitiveness in

global market. The agreement will come into effect when

two-thirds of the current membership of the WTO ratifies

its Instrument of Acceptance. The TFA is expected

to significantly benefit global trade while delivering

support, particularly to developing and Least Developed

Countries (LDCs). The full implementation of the TFA is

expected to achieve a reduction in the cost of trade while

improving global economic growth. Furthermore, the 4th

Trade Policy Review (TPR) of Sri Lanka was successfully

concluded in November 2016 at the WTO head office in

Geneva, after a series of consultations conducted by the

DOC. Sri Lanka needs to review its trade policy every 6

years in order to facilitate the smooth functioning of the

multilateral trading system by enhancing the transparency

of trade policies. Meanwhile, the enactment of Anti-

Dumping, Countervailing and Safeguard Legislation

in Sri Lanka has been long outstanding. The approval

of the Cabinet Ministers for a new memorandum in this

regard was received in October 2016.

A number of measures were implemented

and new measures were proposed by the

government with the intention of strengthening

institutional support to promote exports. The

Agency for International Trade (AfIT) and Agency

for Development (AfD) were established under

the newly formed MODSIT. The AfIT is expected

to act as a high-level forum responsible for policy

decisions related to international trade. The AfIT is

expected to be the focal point for the formulation,

implementation and coordination of international

trade policies, while being responsible for promoting

and developing international trade. The agency is

in the process of drafting a National Trade Policy in

order to provide a strategic trade policy framework

for Sri Lanka. The AfD is in collaborating with the

Harvard Centre for International Development,

Millennium Challenge Corporation, International

Trade Centre (ITC) and the World Economic

Forum, to come up with innovative solutions to

boost Sri Lanka's exports and competitiveness,

drawing upon modern trade theory, new global

trading environments and experiences of the

countries which use trade as the engine of growth.

The initiation of the National Export Strategy

(NES) by the Export Development Board (EDB)

and the establishment of the One-Stop-Shop

in collaboration with more than 15 stakeholder

organisations at the Board of Investment (BOI)

are among the solutions implemented towards

improving the investment climate of Sri Lanka.

Further, Sri Lanka Customs fully automated

its cargo consignment clearance procedure by

introducing a computer based channel selectivity

process. Accordingly, three channels, namely

Green, Amber and Red, were introduced with

changes in the level of examination required. This

automation has reduced the time period required

for the clearance of cargo significantly. Further,

in order to minimise the disparity in economic

development that exists between Colombo suburbs

and the rest of the country, several programmes

have been planned to spread the development

activities through developing economic corridors,

such as Kandy, Colombo, Hambantota and

Colombo and Trincomalee. Economic zones will

be established in Bandaragama, Embilipitiya,

Vavuniya, Kuliyapitiya and Eravur while improving

the investment climate and export competitiveness

of small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Institutional support was extended further

towards the implementation of strategies on

external trade during 2016. The EDB, in line with its

updated strategic plan for 2016-2020, implemented

a number of programmes aimed at promoting

exports, with an ambitious goal to achieve US

dollars 20 billion worth exports by 2020. Further,

in their annual action plan, various activities have

been recognised to increase exports, including

promotion of diversification and value addition,

targeted brand promotion, introduction of new

technology, research and development assistance

and conducting of training and awareness

programmes. Accordingly, a practical approach in

the form of conducting seminars and workshops to

address issues identified in major export markets,

participation of exporters at trade fairs to build

Sri Lanka’s image abroad and improving market

access are strategies to be adopted in achieving

the export target set by its strategic plan. During

2016, the EDB conducted several trade fairs while

participating in international trade fairs abroad. The

16th World Export Development Forum (WEDF), a

flagship event of the ITC, was held in Sri Lanka

in October 2016, with the participation of 600

local and foreign delegates. In addition, the EDB

conducted National Exporters' Forums to resolve

on-going issues related to exports, the Presidential

Export Awards Ceremony and many E-marketing

activities, using its E-market place during 2016.

Further, the EDB has initiated the preparation of a

NES in collaboration with the ITC. The NES is a joint

effort of the government and the private sector, to

provide a detailed and prioritised five-year action-

oriented framework for the development of trade

and competitiveness. The NES will provide a

clear direction for sustainable export-led growth,

to make Sri Lanka a key trade hub in the Indian

Ocean. In addition, Budget 2017 proposed to

appoint a National Trade Prosecutor, who will

be entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring

proper enactment of trade and the commercial

agreements that are expected to be undertaken.

Trade and tariff policies in 2016 were

focused on rationalising and simplifying the

tax regime to promote fair trade. Accordingly,

the budget 2017 proposed to abolish the fee on

the import and export control on tea, tea packing

and logo registration, to support the tea industry.

Also, action to ease regulations on the import of

certain types of tea for re-export was proposed.

The government also expects to gradually phase

out the para-tariffs that are applicable in the tax

system, with the view of promoting Sri Lanka for

foreign investments. In line with this, duty rates

of 96 tariff lines have been adjusted according to

Sri Lanka's bound rate commitments to the WTO.

Further, with a view to facilitating industries,

the duty on industrial raw materials has been

reduced.

To ease challenges that exporters are

expected to face due to the sluggish global

demand, the government has proposed

several initiatives. Accordingly, the budget

2017 proposed tax benefits for exporters and

the establishment of an EXIM bank for trade

facilitation. Further, establishment of free trade

zones, mainly targeting rubber based products,

pharmaceuticals, fabric, mineral, chemical and

automotive industries, and export villages,

mainly targeting information technology (IT),

robotics, fashion, high end apparel and boat

manufacturing as well as government support

for backward integration, especially on textiles and

garments industry, were proposed.

The global and domestic challenges on

international trade highlighted the need for a

clear and proactive trade policy for the country.

The trade policy needs to carefully plan for the

future, addressing the possible impact of "Brexit"

and impact of the foreign trade policy changes by

the new government of the USA. Despite Sri Lanka’s

anticipation on the reinstatement of the EU-GSP+

facility, the concessional access to most of the

markets will be limited, as Sri Lanka is approaching

an upper middle-income country status with a higher

per capita income. Therefore, institutional support

will be crucial to enable exporters to withstand

intensifying global competition and access new

markets and technologies, while preserving the

competitiveness of existing markets. Hence, the

National Trade Policy and the NES that is being

formulated need to emphasise on the improvement

of the competitiveness of exports and introduction

of new export products, to diversify the export

product basket from traditional goods and diversify

the export destinations of Sri Lanka. Aligning the

country’s industrial policy towards export promotion

by reorienting the manufacturing sector to focus on

more technology intensive products with high value

addition is essential to facilitate entry into global

production value chain and thereby to the growth

of merchandise exports. Streamlining the functions

of the different institutions overseeing export

promotion is also vital for the formulation of an

efficient and consensual export strategy. Further,

an import policy entailing the liberalisation of import

tariffs can help induce reciprocal benefits from

import source countries. In turn, this can enable Sri

Lanka to better position itself in the GVC and pave

way for the broadening of the country’s product

sharing network.

5.3 Trade in Goods, Trade Balance, Terms of Trade and Direction of Trade

5.3.1 Export Performance

Earnings from exports contracted in 2016 for

the second consecutive year, mainly owing to

the downward movement in commodity prices

in the international market and modest economic

recovery in Sri Lanka’s major export destinations.

Despite the positive growth recorded in the latter part

of 2016, earnings from exports at US dollars 10,310

million reflected a decline of 2.2 per cent, from US

dollars 10,546 million in 2015, led by the declines

in agricultural and industrial exports during the first

seven months of the year.

Export earnings declined mainly due to

lower agricultural exports, which account for

around one fourth of total exports. Earnings

from agricultural exports declined by 6.3 per cent

to US dollars 2,326 million in 2016, reflecting lower

exports of many categories under agricultural products.

Earnings from tea exports, which declined by 17.7 per

cent in 2015, reduced further by 5.3 per cent in 2016

to US dollars 1,269 million, recording the lowest level

since 2009. The total volume of tea exported declined

by 5.9 per cent to 289 million kilograms, due to lower

production and lower demand. Tea production declined

in 2016 due to adverse weather conditions and trade

union activities in the plantation sector. The demand for

tea contracted mainly due to the lower demand by major

tea export destinations, especially Middle East and

Russia, as a result of lower income levels experienced

by these countries due to relatively low oil prices and

increased geopolitical tensions. However, the average

export price of tea increased marginally by 0.6 per cent

to US dollars 4.39 per kilogram in 2016, despite the 6.3

per cent (year-on-year) decline recorded during the first

half of the year. The reduction in export earnings from

spices and minor agricultural products also contributed

significantly to the lower earnings from agricultural

exports. Export earnings from spices declined by 16.0

per cent to US dollars 317 million in 2016, as against

an increase of 42.7 per cent recorded in 2015, due to

significant reduction in export volumes of pepper and

cloves, by 50.8 per cent and 66.6 per cent, respectively.

However, both export volumes and prices of cinnamon,

and nutmeg and mace increased during the year.

Earnings from minor agricultural products declined

by 28.9 per cent to US dollars 114 million, as export

volumes of arecanuts and rice decreased substantially

by 54.4 per cent and 54.2 per cent, respectively.

Export earnings from coconut, rubber and

seafood increased during the year partly offsetting

the contraction in agricultural exports. Earnings

from the exports of coconut products increased by 4.0

per cent to US dollars 366 million due to increased non-

kernel products, such as fresh nuts, fibre and coconut

shells and ekels, despite a significant decline in earnings

from coconut oil exports, under kernel products, owing to

lower prices. Despite the decline recorded in rubber export

prices, earnings from rubber exports, which declined

continuously since 2012, increased by 25.0 per cent to US

dollars 33 million in 2016, reflecting an increase in export

volumes, by 55.8 per cent to 16 million kilograms. Export

earnings from seafood, which declined significantly in

2015 due to restrictions on market access to the EU

since January 2015, increased by 4.0 per cent to US

to this decline. Export earnings from transport

equipment recorded a 46.0 per cent decline to

US dollars 131 million in 2016, mainly due to the

significantly higher level of exports recorded in

2015, owing to the export of two dredger vessels

that were imported in 2013 and 2014 for the use

of the Colombo Port City Development Project.

Export earnings from petroleum products, which

mainly comprise bunker and aviation fuel,

declined by 23.3 per cent to US dollars 287

million in 2016, partly due to higher competition

from other regional players, such as Singapore

and India. Export earnings from gems, diamonds

and jewellery declined by 17.4 per cent to US

dollars 274 million in 2016 in comparison to the

previous year, reflecting lower global demand.

Further, export earnings from animal fodder,

printing industry products, ceramic products and

chemical products also declined during the year.

Introduction

The link between export growth and economic growth is highly debated in economic literature. Although the common notion is that there is a bi-directional relationship between export growth and economic growth, this relationship has not been seen in relation to Sri Lanka. This was experienced between 2000-2016, wherein GDP grew by a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.4 per cent, while exports grew by only 4.0 per cent (CAGR). Sri Lanka's economic growth during the recent past has mainly been pushed by the expansion of domestic demand rather than increased exports.

The high level of economic growth witnessed during the period 2005-2012, which was mainly due to the expansion in domestic demand, started to stagnate within a 4-5 per cent band from 2013 onwards, emphasising that external demand is paramount for a sustained pace of economic growth in a small economy like Sri Lanka. The widening trade and current account deficits and an increase reliance on unsustainable levels of foreign borrowings were an inevitable consequence of growth which was dependent on non-tradables and domestic demand. This provides compelling evidence that comprehensive strategies, which focus on the promotion of high-value exports, are essential to achieve a sustainable external current account balance and high growth. In addition, the generation of higher export revenues will also serve as a buffer for the accumulated stock of medium and short term foreign liabilities, and can also be utilised for the stabilisation of the exchange rate, thereby contributing to the building up of a sustainable level of reserves that can help improve the country's economic resilience. Furthermore, a renewed focus on exports can help divert investments to more efficient sectors of the economy, thus raising productivity. Growth in exports also entails several other benefits, such as inflow of new technology, employment creation, greater economies of scale and expansion of the productive resource base of the economy.

Sri Lanka was ahead of its regional peers in liberalising the economy in 1977. The adoption of liberal economic policies, such as private sector driven development, export led growth and encouragement of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), led to the immediate realisation of notable improvements in foreign trade and trade openness.1 Trade openness, which was 36.4 per cent in 1977 nearly doubled to 72.2 per cent by 1979, while exports as a percentage of GDP, which was 18.7 per cent in 1977 increased significantly to 29.2 per cent by 1979. This change in policy direction resulted in substantial improvements in export earnings. Export earnings increased from US dollars 767 million in 1977 to US dollars 5,522 million

BOX 07National Strategy towards Export Promotion

in 2000. However, the growth in exports has not been very encouraging since 2000. Earnings from exports in 2016 have increased to US dollars 10,310 million, while expenditure on imports increased to US dollars 19,400 million. As a result, the trade deficit expanded to US dollars 9,090 million by 2016. In spite of the turnaround seen in the immediate aftermath of the adoption of liberal policies, Sri Lanka’s international trade performance has been lacklustre, regressing to levels that were seen during the pre-liberalisation era. In 2016, Sri Lanka's trade openness was 36.5 per cent, while exports relative to GDP reduced to a level of 12.7 per cent. Malaysia had an export to GDP ratio of 67.5 per cent, Thailand 54.2 per cent and Vietnam 83.7 per cent in 2015.

The post liberalised period has witnessed a change in Sri Lanka's export composition from primarily an agriculture based export structure to a more value added labour-intensive product structure. Despite the change in composition, exports continue to be concentrated on two traditional products, namely, garments and tea, which account for more than half of the export basket, reflecting the limited product diversification of the export sector. The export sector also shows a lack of diversification in terms of markets. Europe and the USA continue to account for approximately two-thirds of total exports. Further, approximately 70 per cent of tea exports are to the Middle-East and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), for which demand is sensitive to income earned through oil exports. The lack of product and market diversification indicates the vulnerability of the export sector.

Regional competitors have rapidly expanded their external trade and have emerged as exemplary models of export led growth. The Export Value Index2 presented

3. Nevertheless it must also be noted that, earnings from services exports in Sri Lanka have recorded a notable growth in the recent past. Service exports have increased rapidly since 2009, with significant increases recorded in tourism, transport and ICT/BPO exports. Services imports also have followed the same trend. Although services exports, in net terms, have increased over the years, such increase has not offset the shortfall in merchandise exports.

A similar trend is observed also when analysing the performance of external trade and GDP of several selected Asian countries for the past three decades. While the performance of all countries seems to be similar to each other, Sri Lanka’s performance has fallen well behind with lower CAGR in exports3 and imports despite commendable performance in GDP.

Success Stories from International Experience

An analysis of export growth in countries such as South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Bangladesh, shows that broadly similar export development policies have been adopted by all these countries. Comprehensive export promotion programmes such as export subsidies, export credit schemes with preferential interest rates and tax incentives have been implemented to promote exports. These strategies were complemented by the creation of a conducive macroeconomic environment with low and stable inflation, low interest rates and a competitive exchange rate. Stakeholder engagement was also a central aspect of the overall promotion strategy. Accordingly, regular export promotion meetings were held with stakeholders, including the government, industry professionals, trade facilitators and business personnel so as to make cohesive decisions in a timely manner. An appropriate regulatory environment was also created wherein laws that recognised private ownership were introduced to encourage the private sector to evolve as the engine of growth. New laws that enabled the liberalisation of the capital account and encouraged foreign investment were also introduced, resulting in a surge in FDI flows. An open door policy, introduced as a result of the liberalisation of the economy, paved the way for these countries to develop synergies with developed economies, while gaining assistance on various fronts from international organisations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank.

In terms of domestic production, policies were designed to prioritise initiatives that would facilitate import substitution so that the domestic consumption demand would be fulfilled. Such initiatives included the adoption of technological innovation and the expansion of the manufacturing capacity. When domestic industries acquired the capacity to compete in the international market, the emphasis shifted to the implementation of export expansion policies that encouraged the export of labour-intensive industrial products such as textiles and garments. Once a sustainable level of export growth had been reached, the key thrust of these countries’ industrial policies shifted to reorienting export industries

from labour-intensive ones to industries with high value-addition, in order to align the export sector with rising wage levels and to accommodate the overall growth process. As a result, the share of value added industries increased in tandem with product diversification, while the share of labour-intensive industrial and agricultural exports declined. Export strategies also comprised many country-specific aspects. For example, Vietnam, which was a centrally planned agro-based economy, initiated several economic reform policies in 1986, which led to a transformation of the export sector and the economy as a whole. Although Vietnam introduced several reforms to its large agricultural sector by way of policies related to the development of high-value agro industrial products, such as coffee and rubber and privatisation of state-owned land, the reform agenda prioritised the industrial sector. Although these led to a reduction in share of agricultural exports and the sectoral contribution of GDP, the efficiency of the agriculture sector improved, resulting in the country’s transformation from a net importer to a net exporter of the agricultural products. In the case of Vietnam and other countries, such as South Korea and Thailand, after a substantial level of growth in exports was achieved, policy priorities shifted away from sector-oriented support towards function-oriented support. This led to comprehensive assistance for Research and Development (R&D), which eventually led to significant leaps in technological innovation, resulting in the increase in exports of technology-based products. However, over the long term, the South Korean government withdrew much of the focused assistance provided to the export sector in order to strengthen the market mechanism and to enable domestic players to compete on a level playing field. On the other hand, although Bangladesh’s exports had grown by more than 5 times since 2000 with the benefit of EU-EBA4 facility, resulting in the steady improvement of exports to GDP and trade openness, product diversification continued to remain neglected, where garments currently account for about 90 per cent of total exports. Similar to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh’s main export destinations are the USA and the EU, making its external sector highly vulnerable to unfavourable developments in these regions. The experiences of these countries also highlight the importance of policy consistency to enable all stakeholders to make sustainable decisions for the long-term. However, such polices have also been flexible enough to adapt to current and future developments in the domestic and global environment.

National Strategy towards Export Promotion

A systematic country diagnostic of Sri Lanka conducted by the World Bank in 2016 using a hybrid framework combining the Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco growth diagnostics model and the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2014) assets-based framework, identifies a set of constraints and growth drivers to progress towards the

twin goals of “Ending Poverty" and "Shared Economic Prosperity”. This highlights the areas that require immediate attention to unleash Sri Lanka’s export growth potential by a significant extent, such as revision of Sri Lanka's trade-related policies, provision of more resources and quality enhancing management to the education sector in order to expand the skilled workforce and promotion of innovation by establishing linkages between R&D institutions and networks of entrepreneurs. In developing a strategy to promote exports, the following aspects need to be taken into consideration.

Macroeconomic Policies to Facilitate Trade

Interest and exchange rates are the key prices in an economy that provide incentives for producers and consumers to engage in economic activities in the international and domestic arenas. As financing cost is one of the key factors affecting both production and export activity, maintaining low interest rates in the economy would support to sustain the country's competitive edge in export markets. A low and stable inflation environment would ensure the maintenance of low interest rates. Moreover a subdued and stable inflation environment is also essential for investors to make informed long-term decisions. Given that exchange rate policy is closely linked to the trade outcome, a good trade outcome cannot be expected from a misaligned exchange rate. Sri Lanka has endured prolonged periods of over-valued exchange rates that created a bias against exports. Keeping the nominal exchange rate overvalued, has led to large Balance of Payments (BOP) deficits and loss of reserves that have led the government to recourse to borrowings at commercial interest rates thereby increasing external debt. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has already announced its intention to maintain flexibility in the nominal exchange rate, which reflects a competitive Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) Index eventually being around 100. Such a policy will ensure that the exchange rate is fairly valued and is largely determined by market forces while facilitating the conduct of monetary policy of the country. It is important to highlight that achieving fiscal sustainability is crucial for maintaining low nominal interest rates and a competitive exchange rate.

Continuation of Liberalised Foreign Policy to Facilitate Trade

Considering the high level of competition in the international market, Sri Lanka should exploit existing bilateral and multilateral trade agreements while continuously exploring the potential for new trade opportunities through economic partnership agreements. The initiatives taken towards strengthening bilateral relations and maintaining diplomatic balance by the government are noteworthy. It is important to continue trade negotiations with a view to expanding preferential access to new markets, particularly to the fast growing Asian economies. At the same time, Sri Lankan missions abroad could play an increased role by providing market information to exporters based on market surveys in order to get the right product to the right place.

Revision of Sri Lanka's Trade-related Policies

Greater trade openness would enable export growth and diversification of the economy. A more outward-oriented trade policy can amplify the gains from rebalancing towards a stronger role for the private sector in the economy, and enhancing overall economic growth. Using trade measures (tariff and non-tariff measures) to bring about domestic price stability leads to greater uncertainty inhibiting production planning and supporting import substituting activities. Import restrictions cannot correct an imbalance in the current account deficit of the BOP in the long run unless county accepts lower growth, employment and incomes (ie the low growth, high unemployment and stagnation in real income seen prior to the 1977 liberalisation package). In addition, import restrictions can contribute to widening the trade deficit by discouraging exports as import restrictions are a tax on exports. The restricted trade regime had led to lower production capacity and lower competitiveness in all sectors of the economy, leading to lower comparative advantage for Sri Lankan products, resulting in Sri Lanka losing ground in the international arena.

Improvement in Logistics

Continued investments in logistics, especially sea ports and airports, will continue to play a key role in ensuring competitiveness. Current policies to establish free trade zones, economic corridors, economic zones as well as export villages need to be coordinated with upcoming logistic hubs to reduce transaction cost. Future policies must focus on improving the quality and accessibility of infrastructure under government's national development plan since infrastructure serve as an input in the production process, which will contribute towards increasing competitiveness of exports.

Role of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Export Promotion

The increased focus on SMEs by successive governments to promote inclusive growth, can be exploited in favour of the renewed export promotion strategy, as their cost-effective outputs can be marketed as niche exports or as inputs for larger international firms, thereby enabling firms to build linkages with global markets. The modernisation of the services sector is also important, as the production flow process is now largely dominated by services. Specifically, SMEs can be encouraged to engage in services industries, as these do not require high levels of capital or raw materials.

FDI for Export Promotion

FDI will enable Sri Lanka to develop its current export base, which is highly concentrated on a few low tech products, to high tech manufacturing products. FDI is not only a source of foreign funds, but also a source of foreign technology and knowledge. Such initiatives will complement the presence of a highly skilled and knowledgeable

workforce and will thereby further increase Sri Lanka’s attractiveness as a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) destination and enable Sri Lanka to enter into global value chains. In attracting FDI, Sri Lanka needs to focus on improving its national competitiveness. To this end, Sri Lanka needs to launch a rigorous reform agenda to address the bottlenecks that hinder the attraction of FDI.

Encourage R&D and Innovation

Innovation leads to diversify the production base, adds more value to the final product, improves the cost competitiveness helping countries to attain a higher share of exports in the global market. A sustained increase in R&D spending and promoting innovation will have a long term effect on competitiveness. The government needs to take necessary initiatives to connect the entrepreneur networks to existing R&D facilities as the private sector involvement in R&D and innovation is critical in commercialising research outcomes.

Way Forward

It is evident that for the export sector to emerge as a key driver of economic growth, formulating a strategic plan to drive the export sector within the overall development strategy of the government is important. Several measures, spearheaded by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT) and the Export Development Board (EDB) are currently underway. The National Export Strategy, initiated by the EDB, is a collaborative effort of the state and the private sector and provides a five-year action-oriented framework for the development of trade and competitiveness. Simultaneously, a National Trade Policy has been drafted with the objective of attracting more export-oriented FDI, to improve trade logistics, to make customs procedures more transparent and efficient, and to implement other measures to boost a firm's ability to compete in the global market. By recognising the need for broad-based institutional support, the government has already taken steps to create two agencies, the Agency for International Trade (AfIT) and the Agency for Development (AfD). The AfIT is rectifying issues in existing trade pacts with the Indian subcontinent while exploring an economic partnership agreement with India, to use Sri Lanka’s improved investment climate to attract investment that caters to the entire market of the subcontinent. The AfIT is also pursuing new bilateral and multilateral trade opportunities beyond the subcontinent especially with China, Singapore, the EU and the USA, which cater to a market of about 3 billion, complying with the non-aligned foreign policy of the government. The AfD, on the other hand, is expected to contribute to development efforts by collaborating with the private sector to identify constraints on the development process and by building multi-functional teams that can work across sectors to resolve issues to enable the private sector to enhance capabilities, engage in product development and foster export growth. The

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

government will need to play a proactive and unyielding role in creating economic transformation to revitalise the export sector, allowing the private sector to drive the growth momentum. Enhancing exports would reduce the trade deficit and help to shrink the current account deficit of the BOP. The successful countries of East and Southeast Asia have driven their growth process through surplus in the current account. Priority must be attached to eliminate chronic external sector imbalances experienced by Sri Lanka for several decades.

The revival of the external sector will depend on the development of farsighted yet practical, strategies of a cohesive nature. All relevant stakeholders have to reach a consensus on the creation of a well-coordinated

industrial and trade policy that is aligned with macroeconomic policy and the overall strategic direction of the government. This can serve as the foundation for an export promotion policy, which is consistent, practical and well-accepted by all stakeholders. Initiatives already taken by the government are expected to provide necessary policy direction and support for the revitalisation of the country's export sector.

2016 mainly due to the significant increase in

expenditure on imports recorded in the last quarter

of 2016. Increase in the imports of investment goods

and non-fuel intermediate goods contributed to the

growth in import expenditure, negating the favourable

impact of the decline in import expenditure on other

categories, such as fuel and non-food consumer

goods. Import expenditure on food and beverages

remained broadly unchanged from the level recorded

in 2015. Despite low commodity prices prevailing in

the international market and prudent policy measures

adopted by the government and the Central Bank

to rationalise imports, higher economic activities in

the country led to increased expenditure on overall

imports. Accordingly, the total expenditure on imports

The increase in expenditure on import of

investment goods was the major contributory

factor for the increase in the overall expenditure

on imports. Expenditure on investment goods,

which accounts for 27 per cent of total expenditure

on imports, increased by 13.8 per cent to US

dollars 5,198 million in 2016, reflecting growth in

the imports of major investment good categories,

except transport equipment. Import expenditure

on machinery and equipment increased by 20.3

per cent to US dollars 2,741 million in 2016,

reflecting significant increases in all subcategories.

Electronic equipment, machinery and equipment

parts, telecommunication devices and agricultural

machinery were the key contributors to the growth

of machinery and equipment imports. Import

expenditure on building materials increased by

16.0 per cent to US dollars 1,569 million in 2016.

Import expenditure on all subcategories of building

materials, except insulated wires and cables,

increased substantially. Imports of cement, articles

of iron and steel, ceramic products, and wood

products were the largest contributors for the

growth in import expenditure on building materials.

Meanwhile, import expenditure on transport

equipment declined by 5.5 per cent to US dollars

880 million, mainly due to the reduction in the

importation of auto-trishaws and buses.

Import expenditure on intermediate goods

increased by 2.4 per cent to US dollars 9,870

million in 2016, accounting for 51 per cent of

the country’s total import bill. Expenditure on

textiles and textile articles imports was the largest

expenditure category, surpassing fuel imports, and

increased by 17.8 per cent to US dollars 2,705

million in 2016, in line with the increase in the

export of textiles and garments. Import expenditure

on gold increased significantly to US dollars

374 million in 2016 from US dollars 42 million in

2015, owing to an increase in the volume of gold

imported. Prices of gold in international commodity

markets exhibited an increasing trend during the

first three quarters of 2016, but declined during the

last quarter.

Expenditure on fuel imports declined by

8.1 per cent to US dollars 2,481 million, due

to reduced expenditure on both crude oil and

refined petroleum imports, while expenditure

on coal imports increased. The volume of crude

oil imports declined by 4.5 per cent in 2016 while

the average price paid per barrel declined to US

dollars 46.30 from US dollars 54.80 per barrel

in 2015. Import prices of refined petroleum also

declined by 19.9 per cent, while import volumes

rose by 17.0 per cent during this period, partly due

to increased thermal power generation owing to

drought conditions in the country. Expenditure on

coal imports increased by 23.9 per cent in 2016

mainly due to the significant increase in coal based

power generation. Accordingly expenditure on fuel

imports, as a share of total import expenditure,

further declined to 12.8 per cent in 2016 from

14.3 per cent in 2015 and 23.7 per cent in 2014.

Meanwhile, import expenditure on fertiliser declined

by 52.7 per cent, due to a reduction in both prices

and volumes, while expenditure on wheat and

maize imports declined by 30.2 per cent. Import

expenditure relating to certain other categories of

intermediate goods, including food preparations,

unmanufactured tobacco, base metals, chemical

products, and mineral products, also declined

during 2016 compared to the previous year.

Import expenditure on consumer goods

declined by 8.4 per cent to US dollars 4,319

million in 2016 in comparison to the previous

year, due to a reduction in the expenditure on

the import of non-food consumer goods. Import

expenditure on non-food consumer goods declined

by 12.8 per cent to US dollars 2,692 million, mainly

led by the reduction in imports of vehicles for

personal use. The increase in import taxes on the

importation of motor vehicles by the government,

together with macro prudential measures adopted

by the Central Bank imposing a maximum Loan to

Value (LTV) ratio in respect of loans and advances

granted to purchase motor vehicles by banks and

financial institutions were the main reasons for

this decline. Import expenditure on clothing and

accessories, printed material and stationery, and

rubber products also declined in 2016. In contrast,

import expenditure on medical and pharmaceutical

items recorded an increase of 14.3 per cent to

US dollars 526 million. Home appliances and

household and furniture items also increased by

22.5 per cent and 21.5 per cent, respectively. Thus,

import expenditure on consumer goods, excluding

food and beverages, contributed to 14 per cent of

the total import expenditure.

Import expenditure on food and beverages

in 2016 remained broadly unchanged from the

level recorded in 2015. Import expenditure on

sugar increased by 35.6 per cent to US dollars 343

million in 2016, mainly due to the increase in sugar

prices rather than the volume. Import expenditure

on beverages, spices, seafood and fruits also

recorded increases with higher import volumes.

Meanwhile, a reduction in the import volume of rice,

and thereby its import expenditure, contributed

largely to offset the increases in import expenditure.

Upward revisions in import tariffs applicable to

rice in 2015 and early 2016, to discourage imports

due to increased supply of rice in the domestic

market, contributed to the decline in rice imports

to 29,524 metric tons in 2016, from 285,604 metric

tons in 2015. Import expenditure on dairy products

declined marginally by 0.6 per cent to US dollars

249 million in 2016 owing to a significant decline

in the average import price of milk powder despite

an increase in volume. The import expenditure on

onions, lentils and potatoes also declined during

2016.

5.3.3 Trade Balance

The deficit in the trade account, which

contracted during the first four months

of 2016, on cumulative basis, expanded

thereafter, resulting in an expansion during

the year 2016. Decline in earnings from exports

during 2016 compared to 2015 and the substantial

increase in import expenditure on intermediate

and investment goods, particularly during the

last quarter of 2016, expanded the trade deficit.

The trade deficit widened to US dollars 9,090

million in 2016 compared to US dollars 8,388

million recorded in 2015. The trade deficit as a

percentage of GDP increased to 11.2 per cent in

2016 compared to 10.4 per cent in 2015.

5.3.4 Terms of Trade

Terms of trade improved in 2016. Significant

reduction observed in the import price index, in

comparison to the reduction observed in the export

price index resulted to increase terms of trade by

3.7 per cent. Accordingly, the terms of trade index

increased to 104.0 index points in 2016 from 100.3

index points in 2015.

The overall export price index declined by

1.5 per cent in 2016 with a reduction in price

indices pertaining to all major categories of

exports. The price index for agricultural exports

reduced by 1.3 per cent in 2016 compared to 2015,

with low prices that prevailed in the international

commodity market, particularly during the first

half of the year. Despite the lower export prices

of tea during the first seven months of the year,

the export price index for tea increased by 0.2

per cent due to high prices being recorded since

August 2016. The export price indices for rubber

and coconut declined by 3.3 per cent and 4.8 per

cent, respectively, during this period. The export

price indices for minor agricultural products and

seafood also declined while the export price index

for vegetables recorded an increase. The price

index for industrial exports declined by 1.3 per

cent with significant reductions in export price

indices for many sub categories. The export price

index for petroleum products declined by 13.9 per

cent due to low petroleum prices prevailed in the

international market in 2016. However, the export

price indices for textiles and garments, ceramic

products and leather, travel goods and footwear,

increased by 0.8 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 1.0 per

cent, respectively.

The overall import price index declined by

5.1 per cent in 2016 mainly due to low petroleum

prices in the world market when compared to

2015, despite the gradual increase in petroleum

prices during the latter part of 2016. However,

the import price index relating to textiles and textile

articles increased by 2.7 per cent, partly owing to

the increase in prices of cotton in the world market

during 2016. Similarly, the import price index

relating to diamonds, precious stones and metals

increased, reflecting the increase in prices of gold

in the global markets. Price indices for all other

categories under intermediate goods declined. The

price indices for machinery and equipment and

building materials, categorised under investment

goods declined, while that of transport equipment

increased. In contrast to price indices for

intermediate and investment goods, the price index

for consumer goods increased, reflecting price

increases in both food and beverages and non-

food consumer goods. Under food and beverages,

the import price index for sugar, oil and fats, fruits

and seafood increased significantly. However, the

import price index relating to cereals and milling

industry products recorded a decline during the

year.

5.3.5 Direction of Trade

Main destinations for Sri Lankan exports and

the type of goods exported to such destinations

broadly unchanged in 2016 in comparison to

2015, while China became the main source of

imports in 2016, surpassing India which was the

main import source since 2001. The USA and the

UK continued to be the two main export destinations

accounting for 37 per cent of total export earnings

in 2016. China, India and the USA were the main

trading partners of Sri Lanka as total trade with

China and India exceeded US dollars 4 billion,

while trade with the USA exceeded US dollars 3

billion contributing 14.9 per cent, 14.7 per cent and

11.3 per cent, respectively to total external trade.

Meanwhile, the trade with UAE, Singapore, Japan

and the UK exceeded US dollars 1 billion each.

Trade with India and Japan declined substantially

in 2016 compared to 2015 with a reduction in both

imports from and exports to these two countries,

while trade with China, Singapore, Germany, Italy

and the USA increased significantly.

The USA remained the main export

destination in 2016, accounting for 27.3 per

cent of total export earnings. Exports to the USA

totalled US dollars 2,810 million, of which 74.9 per

cent was derived from garment exports and 8.7 per

cent from rubber products. Earnings from garment

exports to the USA remained broadly unchanged in

2016, accounting for 45.7 per cent of total garment

exports. The UK continued to be the second largest

export destination, registering 10.1 per cent of total

export earnings and one third of export earnings

from the EU. Garments and rubber products were

the main export items, accounting for 79.1 per cent

and 2.8 per cent, respectively, of receipts from the

UK. Total earnings from garment exports to the

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

165

EU in 2016 amounted to US dollars 1,905 million,

accounting for 41.4 per cent of total export earnings

from garments. The main export destinations within

the EU, other than the UK, were Germany, Italy,

Belgium, Netherlands and France. Garments,

rubber products, tea, food, beverages and tobacco,

and spices were the main exports to Germany

and Italy, which were the fourth and fifth largest

export destinations. Total exports to India, which

is the third largest export destination, declined

to US dollars 554 million in 2016 from US dollars

643 million in 2015, due to the reduction in export

earnings from tea, minor agricultural products,

spices, transport equipment and animal fodder. Iran

emerged as the top buyer of Sri Lankan tea in 2016

surpassing Russia. Other major buyers for tea were

Iraq, Turkey and the UAE. These countries together

contributed to 45.2 per cent of earnings from the

export of tea in 2016.

China became the main import origin of Sri

Lanka in 2016, accounting for 21.7 per cent of

the total expenditure on imports. Expenditure

incurred on Chinese imports increased by 13.6

per cent to US dollars 4,215 million in 2016, with

increased expenditure on textiles and articles,

machinery and equipment, building material,

transport equipment and chemical products. India,

the second largest import origin in 2016, accounted

for only 19.7 per cent of total imports, registering

a decline of 10.6 per cent, due to the reduction

in import expenditure on petroleum products and

vehicles, such as auto-trishaws and motor cars.

Singapore, the third largest import origin accounted

for 6.1 per cent of total imports. Imports from

Singapore mainly comprised petroleum products,

machinery and equipment, and diamonds and

precious stones. The UAE was the fourth largest

import source with imports from UAE, consisting of

petroleum products, diamonds and precious stones

and base metals. Expenditure incurred on imports

from Japan, which is the fifth largest import origin,

declined by 31.6 per cent due to a reduction in the

imports of vehicles, despite higher expenditure

incurred for the import of vehicle and machinery

parts and machinery and equipment from Japan.

5.4 Current and Capital Account

5.4.1 Trade in Services

Sri Lanka’s export of services continued

to record a satisfactory growth in 2016,

supporting the external current account during

the year. Earnings from exports of services grew

by 11.6 per cent to US dollars 7,138 million in

2016, in comparison to US dollars 6,397 million in

2015. The key growth driver within trade in services

was earnings from tourism, followed by exports

of transport and telecommunications, computer

and information services. Meanwhile, outflows

on account of services also increased by 4.6 per

cent to US dollars 4,259 million during the year,

due to the rising demand for services imports,

particularly in the travel sector. Overall, the surplus

of the services account amounted to US dollars

2,879 million, which is an increase of 23.8 per cent

compared to that of 2015.

Transport Services

The expansion of transport services

contributed favourably towards the services

account in 2016. Gross inflows on account of

transportation services, which comprise passenger

fares, freight charges, port and airport related

activities, registered a growth of 6.9 per cent, to

reach US dollars 2,250 million during the year.

Meanwhile, outflows on account of transportation

services also increased by 2.5 per cent to US dollars

1,618 million in 2016, as a result of increased port

and airport related service payments driven by the

expansion in import activities and the increase in

Sri Lankans travelling abroad. Consequently, net

inflows from the transport sector increased to US

dollars 632 million during the year compared to US

dollars 526 million in 2015.

Inflows relating to passenger fares increased

by 7.6 per cent in 2016 over the previous year

to US dollars 1,073 million. The improvement

in inflows from passenger fares can be mainly

attributed to the increase in number of passengers

travelling to Sri Lanka. The number of destinations

served by SriLankan Airlines expanded during the

year. These destinations included Middle East, Far

East and several Asian countries. This has also

contributed towards the expansion in earnings

from passenger fares during the year. Meanwhile,

SriLankan Airlines took over operations of Mihin

Lanka in 2016 and absorbed nine short haul routes

and three aircrafts. However, the discontinuation

of some flight destinations by SriLankan Airlines

as well as the downward revision of airfares

during 2016 restricted the growth in earnings from

passenger fares. The resurfacing of the runway at

the Bandaranaike International Airport will enhance

the capacity of the runway, supporting the realisation

of the growth potential in this sector in the long run.

With the expansion in port related activities,

inflows on account of freight charges, with

respect to both port and airport related activities

increased in 2016. Gross inflows from these

services increased by 6.3 per cent to US dollars

1,177 million in 2016, mainly due to increased

cargo, container and transhipment volumes handled

at the port of Colombo. The major contributor to this

expansion was increased operations at the Colombo

International Container Terminals (CICT), which

surpassed the milestone volume of over 2 million

TEUs in container handling during its second year of

operations at full scale. Meanwhile, recognizing Sri

Lanka’s maritime capacity in the global arena, South

Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) was awarded the

“Best Terminal in South Asia” by the Singapore

based Global Ports Forum in February 2017.

Travel and Tourism

The Sri Lankan tourism industry, a major

foreign currency earner in the economy,

continued its growth momentum during 2016.

Tourist arrivals crossed the 2 million milestone for

the first time in the history, reaching 2,050,832

arrivals, recording an impressive annual growth

of 14.0 per cent in 2016. The significant increase

in tourism related infrastructure development and

investments, increased connectivity through the

operation of new airlines and cruise lines, together

with country specific promotional campaigns have

contributed to this impressive growth. Increased

geo-political tension in major tourist destinations of

the world also helped Sri Lanka to attract tourists.

Tourist arrivals from all major regions,

except Africa, increased in 2016. Western Europe

continued to be the largest region of tourist origin

for Sri Lanka, representing 31.4 per cent, with the

number of tourist arrivals increasing by 16.5 per

cent to 643,333. The share of tourist arrivals from

East Asia has increased continuously since 2010,

accounting for 20.7 per cent of total arrivals in 2016

compared to 10.5 per cent in 2010, contributed by

the impressive growth recorded in tourist arrivals

from China. India remained the largest country of

tourist origin with 356,729 arrivals in 2016, while

China remained second, followed by the UK,

Germany and France. These 5 largest tourist

source destinations together have accounted for

51.0 per cent of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka in 2016,

reflecting the market concentration of tourism.

The highest contribution to growth was recorded

from China with 271,577 tourist arrivals, followed

by India and the UK. In terms of the purpose of

visit, a majority of tourists (83.4 per cent) visited the

country for holidays. Tourist arrivals for business

purposes was 1.8 per cent, while the share of tourist

arrivals for other purposes, such as visiting friends

and relatives, religious and cultural purposes,

official, MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences

& Events), health, education and sports, was 14.8

per cent of total arrivals in 2016.

Earnings from tourism continued its growth

momentum in 2016, contributing towards the

strengthening of the services account. As a

result of the increase in tourist arrivals, together

with higher spending and the increased duration

of stay by tourists, earnings from tourism grew by

18.0 per cent to US dollars 3,518 million in 2016,

in comparison to US dollars 2,981 million in 2015.

According to the latest annual survey on tourist

spending and duration of stay, conducted by the

Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA),

the average spending per day by a tourist increased

to US dollars 168.2 in 2016 from US dollars 164.1

in 2015. Further, the average duration of stay by a

tourist was estimated at 10.2 days in 2016, which

was a marginal improvement in comparison to

10.1 days in 2015. The healthy growth in earnings

from tourism can be mainly attributed to extensive

tourism promotional activities and hotel and other

related infrastructure development during the post

conflict era. The upward trend in the performance

of the tourism sector is expected to continue in

the coming years, with efforts to uplift Sri Lanka’s

brand value through tactical marketing campaigns

and continued investments in enhancing the

tourism infrastructure of the country. Meanwhile,

outflows related to travel are also estimated to

have increased by 8.6 per cent to US dollars 1,542

million in 2016. Given these developments, the

travel and tourism sub sector recorded a surplus of

US dollars 1,977 million.

The tourism sector investment expanded

further in 2016. During 2016, approval was

granted for 41 new hotel projects with 1,526

rooms with an investment of US dollars 126 million

compared to 37 projects approved in 2015. Several

international hotels, including Shangri-La, RIU and

Best Western, commenced their operations adding

1,569 rooms to the industry, while several major

hotel projects, such as Hyatt, Sheraton, ITC and

NEXT continued their construction work during

the year. Further, supplementary establishments,

which include boutique villas, guest houses, home

stays, heritage homes, bungalows and rented

apartments, increased in 2016 by 149 to 1,558,

with a total room capacity increased by 833 rooms

to 11,535. These new hotel projects will help the

government to achieve its target of building 75,000

rooms to cater to 4.5 million tourist arrivals by 2020.

The tourism industry in the Eastern and

Northern provinces of the country continued to

grow with local and foreign investors, focusing

their attention on harnessing the high potential

for tourism in these provinces. Reflecting this

development, many new projects related to tourism

have been completed in the Eastern and Northern

provinces, particularly in Passikudah, Nilaweli and

Jaffna, since the end of the conflict. In addition,

proposals have been made to establish new tourism

projects in islands of Jaffna and Mannar, Mullativu,

and Kuchchaweli in the North and East. Further,

proposals have been made to develop integrated

tourism resort projects in Kalpitiya and a resort and

recreation development in Dedduwa by the BOI.

Coordinated efforts were taken to improve

the standards of Sri Lanka’s tourism industry. A

new classification for tourist hotels was introduced

by the SLTDA in April 2016, replacing the earlier

classifications created in 1968 and 1999. Under

the new classification requirement, all tourist hotels

registered with SLTDA are required to have a star

classification, which will have to be reclassified

every 3 years. Further, as per the budget 2016, a

programme for the absorption of the informal sector

into the formal tourism sector was launched for the

purpose of regulating and improving the quality of

service. "Sri Lanka Tourism", which comprises

SLTDA, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau

(SLTPB), Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel

Management, and Sri Lanka Convention Bureau,

celebrated its golden jubilee in May 2016, and

organised many activities on par with this event.

The SLTDA, together with other tourism institutions,

organised a tourists’ holiday festival, with cultural

shows, seasonal events, food festivals, exhibitions

and entertainment to cater to peak tourist arrivals in

December 2016. Recognising the growth potential

in the tourism industry, the budget 2017 introduced

several proposals mainly to increase the quality

of the tourism industry and tourist attractions,

construction of a convention centre to develop

MICE tourism and financial support schemes for

tourist organisations aiming towards the sustainable

development of the tourism industry of Sri Lanka.

Targeted promotion campaigns launched by

the SLTPB helped Sri Lanka to position itself

as a leading and one of the most attractive

tourist destinations in the world. Recognising

the importance of tourism promotion, the SLTPB

continued its country specific strategic marketing

plan in 2016 and carried out activities, such as

participating in travel fairs, conducting road shows

and advertising campaigns in key markets. This also

included global outdoor promotional activities, such

as advertising at the UK underground, advertising in

reputed global telecasts such as National Geographic

and BBC Wildlife. In addition the SLTPB increasingly

utilised web based promotional activities in 2016

conducting visiting bloggers' programmes, online

advertising campaigns, digital advertising through

web banners, dedicated emails and social media

programmes, especially targeting high end tourists.

These promotional campaigns have assisted to

increase the value of the Sri Lankan nation brand

computed by Brand Finance, a leading independent

business valuation company, to US dollars 74 billion

at a country ranking of 55 in 2016 upgraded from 57

in 2015. In addition, many travel related entities have

endorsed Sri Lanka as one of the best destinations to

travel in 2016 and 2017, as a result of effective and

continuous promotions carried out by the SLTPB.

Although vigorous promotional campaigns

carried out during the last few years and

initiatives taken to develop infrastructure

related to the tourism industry helped attract

tourists, Sri Lanka has not yet tapped into its

full potential in the global market. While Sri

Lanka attracted 2 million tourists in 2016, some

countries in the South East Asian region, such

as Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, have

recorded tourist arrivals of more than 10 million

per year. Sri Lanka can explore its potential in

the areas of medical tourism and eco-tourism as

the country is already competitive in providing

Ayurvedic medicine and high quality private

healthcare facilities. A proper mechanism needs to

be designed as a Public Private Partnership (PPP),

to train workers for the hospitality industry as the

labour shortage may hinder the growth momentum

of the industry in the near future. Training courses

on hospitality management need to be promoted

at the regional level, combined with internship

programmes. Further, measures taken to improve

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

the room capacity also need to be continued. Since

home stays are gaining popularity among budget

tourists, it is important to standardise informal sector

accommodation as higher standards are required to

maintain the country’s competitiveness in the long

run. At the same time, policy initiatives are needed

to diversify the availability of tourist activities in Sri

Lanka, where more emphasis should be paid towards

lagging sectors of the tourism industry, such as leisure

tourism and recreational tourism in order to increase

average guest nights, which is currently stagnated.

Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services

Earnings from telecommunications,

computer and information services recorded

a growth in 2016. Gross inflows on account of

telecommunications, computer and information

services grew by 6.6 per cent to US dollars 858

million in 2016 in comparison to US dollars 805

million in 2015. The telecommunications sub sector

grew at a moderate rate during the year with total

earnings increasing to US dollars 134 million from

US dollars 128 million in 2015. The expansion in

earnings was supported by the increase in the usage

of internet based communication services, whilst the

decline in the usage of International Direct Dialling

(IDD) services dampened the growth of the sector.

Due to the continued technological innovations in

the telecommunications industry in areas such as

digitisation, usage of broadband internet connections,

satellite and cable TV services improved during 2016,

supporting higher revenue generation in the sector.

The opening of the cable landing station of South

East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe 5 (SEA-

ME-WE 5) in Matara marked a significant milestone

in the telecommunications industry in 2016.2 This

project will enhance the reliability of Sri Lanka’s global

connectivity, thereby improving the performance of

the telecommunications industry in the medium to

long run.

Meanwhile, the computer and information

services sub sector continued its growth

trajectory in 2016. Earnings from computer and

information services improved by 7.0 per cent to US

dollars 724 million in 2016. The growth in this sector

was mainly driven by the rapid expansion of Software

and Information Technology Enabled Services

(ITES) that includes Business Process Outsourcing

(BPO) and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO).

Sri Lanka was ranked 63rd among 139 countries in

the 2016 “Networked Readiness Index” published

by the World Economic Forum, which measures

2 The SEA-ME-WE 5 is a state-of-the-art undersea cable system that connects sixteen countries across three continents.

how economies use the opportunities offered by

information and communications technologies

in enhancing competitiveness and well-being.

Recognising the growth potential of the industry, the

government is expected to revise existing labour laws

related to flexible working hours, contract employment

and performance based wages to complement the

prerequisites of the ITES industry as proposed in the

National Budget 2017. It is also imperative to develop

a highly talented skill pool, comprehensive regulatory

framework and modern infrastructure facilities in

order to unleash the full potential of this industry.

5.4.2 Primary Income

The deficit in the primary income account

widened in 2016. This was mainly due to the

decline in earnings from reserve assets coupled

with continued interest payments and outflows in

terms of reinvestment of earnings and dividend

payments. Accordingly, the deficit in the primary

income account increased by 8.5 per cent to US

dollars 2,184 million during the year, in comparison

to a deficit of US dollars 2,013 million in 2015. Inflows

to the primary income account, which amounted

to US dollars 127 million in 2015, declined to US

dollars 120 million in 2016. The fall in inflows was

primarily due to the reduction in earnings from

reserve assets, in line with the decline in gross

official reserves during the year. Meanwhile, the total

outflow from the primary income account amounted

to US dollars 2,304 million in 2016 in comparison

to US dollars 2,140 million in 2015. Compared

to the previous year, a significant increase in

the repatriation of profits as dividends as well as

an increase in the reinvestment of earnings from

profits of direct investment enterprises by foreign

investors were observed in 2016. Consequently,

dividend payments and reinvestment of earnings

by direct investment enterprises, which stood at

US dollars 787 million in 2015, increased to US

dollars 953 million in 2016. Meanwhile, interest

payments on portfolio investments declined during

the year due to the reduction in the outstanding

stock of Treasury bonds held by non-residents. This

resulted in a modest decline of interest payments

related to portfolio investments, from US dollars 764

million in 2015 to US dollars 756 million in 2016.

However, interest payments on ISBs continued to

rise as a result of the new issuance. Further, primary

income outflows in the form of other investments,

which consist of interest payments on foreign loans,

increased moderately during 2016. The increase in

interest payments on account of foreign loans could

be attributed to the gradual increase in the interest

payments of loans obtained by State Owned Business

Enterprises (SOBEs), as a result of increased foreign

loan liabilities of these enterprises. However, interest

payments for government project loans remained

broadly unchanged from levels observed in the

previous year.

5.4.3 Secondary Income

The secondary income account, which

consists of private and government transfers,

recorded a modest growth in 2016, recovering

to some extent from the marginal decline in

2015. Workers’ remittances, which account for

the majority of inflows to the secondary income

account as the key source of private transfers,

grew at a modest rate of 3.7 per cent to US dollars

7,242 million, as against the decline of 0.5 per

cent observed in 2015. Meanwhile, receipts in the

form of government transfers declined in 2016.

Consequently, inflows to the secondary income

account grew by 3.6 per cent amounting to US

dollars 7,260 million in 2016, in comparison to

US dollars 7,007 million in the previous year. The

relatively low growth in workers’ remittances can be

attributed to the fall in the income levels in countries

in the Middle Eastern region as a result of persistently

low oil prices and geopolitical uncertainties. Further,

a decline of 8.6 per cent in labour migration under

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

172

5

the categories, such as skilled, semi-skilled and

unskilled, including housemaids, during 2016 would

also have contributed to the deceleration of workers’

remittances. The decline in labour migration under

the semi-skilled and unskilled categories, including

housemaids, was due to concerted efforts by the

Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE)

to streamline migration of low skilled female labour.

This decline could also be attributed to the restrictions

imposed to discourage foreign labour through labour

market nationalisation policies of Saudi Arabia, which

is a key destination for Sri Lankan migrant workers.

However, according to the data released by the

SLBFE, labour migration under the professional

category increased by 5.1 per cent during the year,

continuing the compositional transformation in

workers' remittances observed over the past few

years.

5.5 Current Account Balance

The current account deficit widened in 2016

amidst the deterioration of the trade account

and the primary income account, despite the

surpluses in the services and the secondary

income accounts. A significant deterioration of

the trade balance was witnessed as a result of

increased import expenditure on intermediate and

investment goods amidst a decline in earnings from

exports. However, increased inflows to the services

account, which was primarily driven by the substantial

increase in earnings from tourism and the surplus in

the secondary income account, consisting mainly

of workers’ remittances, helped in cushioning the

deficits in the trade and primary income accounts of

the current account to a certain extent. As a result,

the current account deficit widened marginally to US

dollars 1,942 million in 2016, compared to US dollars

1,883 million in 2015. Accordingly, the current account

deficit as a percentage of GDP increased marginally

to 2.4 per cent of GDP in 2016 in comparison to 2.3

per cent of GDP in 2015.

5.6 Capital Account Balance

The capital account recorded a marginal

surplus of US dollars 26 million in 2016 in

comparison to a surplus of US dollars 46 million

in 2015. This was the combined result of a decline

in capital transfers received by the government

and the decline in capital outflows from the private

sector in 2016.

5.7 Financial Account

Both net incurrence of liabilities and net

acquisition of financial assets of the financial

account of the BOP remained subdued in

2016. Accordingly, net incurrence of liabilities

amounted to US dollars 2,199 million in 2016, in

comparison to US dollars 3,223 million recorded

in 2015. Meanwhile, net acquisition of assets

amounted to US dollars 82 million in comparison

to US dollars 911 million in 2015. Lower level

of inflows to the financial account reflected the

continued moderation of capital inflows, particularly

in the form of FDIs and foreign investments to the

Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). Furthermore,

Sri Lanka experienced significant capital outflows

in 2016, especially from the rupee denominated

government securities market, in the backdrop

of increasing global interest rates and a stronger

growth momentum in the United States economy.

Continued capital outflows, high debt

repayments and moderate inflows to the

financial account in 2016 necessitated foreign

financing during the year. Accordingly, the

financial account was supported by the issuance

of ISBs amounting to US dollars 1.5 billion, a

new international currency swap arrangement

of US dollars 400 million, following the maturity

of international currency swaps amounting to

US dollars 1.1 billion and foreign currency term

financing facilities amounting to US dollars

700 million. Sri Lanka also entered into an

EFF with the IMF in order to support the BOP and

the government’s reform agenda. Consequently, Sri

Lanka received two tranches of the EFF, amounting

to US dollars 332 million, during the year. Despite

these measures, inflows to the financial account

remained moderate in 2016 with foreign investors

in the rupee denominated government securities

unwinding their holdings. Amidst these imbalances,

servicing scheduled debt obligations along with

the provision of liquidity to the domestic foreign

exchange market by the Central Bank resulted in a

significant decline in gross official reserves in 2016.

5.7.1 Direct Investment

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows

remained at moderate levels in 2016. Total FDI

inflows, inclusive of foreign loans to BOI companies,

amounted to US dollars 1,079 million, while direct

investments that exclude foreign borrowings of BOI

companies amounted to US dollars 898 million in

2016. In comparison, total FDI inflows with foreign

loans in 2015 amounted to US dollars 1,160 million,

while the same excluding foreign loans amounted

to US dollars 680 million. While the low level of FDI

inflows have been a chronic issue in the Sri Lankan

economy, FDI inflows during 2016 were affected

by the evolving global economic outlook, in the

backdrop of the interest rate hike by the US Federal

Reserve. In addition, the significant increase in

and intra company loans, while repayment of

shareholder advances and intra company debt

amounted to US dollars 87 million. During the year,

BOI companies received US dollars 181 million of

foreign loans from non-related lenders.

FDI inflows in 2016 were mainly channelled

to the tourism, telecommunication and

manufacturing sectors. The top five countries of

direct investments, based on immediate country

of investment, were Malaysia, India, Netherlands,

China and United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile,

direct investments abroad by Sri Lankan investors

increased in 2016 to US dollars 237 million,

compared to US dollars 53 million in 2015. The

notable increase in direct investments abroad was

mainly due to investments by the Sri Lankan apparel

industry abroad. Foreign investments abroad by

Sri Lankan companies were primarily made in

India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Fiji and Maldives.

5.7.2 Portfolio Investment

Equity

Foreign investments in equity, which reflect

foreign inflows to the CSE excluding direct

investments, remained subdued in 2016. Similar

to direct investments, subdued investor sentiments on

capital markets of emerging economies continued to

affect equity investments and resulted in a moderate

net inflow of US dollars 24 million in 2016. The net

inflow of foreign investment to the CSE in 2016

consisted of a net inflow of US dollars 10 million to

the secondary market and an inflow of US dollars 14

million to the primary market. This is a continuation of

modest foreign investments in companies listed in the

CSE from the previous year, where a net outflow of

US dollars 60 million was recorded in 2015.

Debt Securities

Sri Lanka continued to tap international

markets through the issuance of ISBs. In July 2016,

Sri Lanka successfully issued a dual tranche ISB of

US dollars 1.5 billion, with US dollars one billion to be

matured in 10 years and US dollars 500 million to be

matured in five and a half years. This was Sri Lanka’s

10th ISB issuance and the country’s first dual tranche

offering in the international market. Both tranches

were priced below the initial price guidance, reflecting

continued confidence of foreign investors in Sri Lanka’s

medium term outlook despite a challenging global

economic environment. However, foreign investments

in Treasury bonds and Sri Lanka Development Bonds

(SLDBs) continued to record an outflow in 2016.

Consequently, net outflows from Treasury bonds and

SLDBs amounted to US dollars 361 million and US

dollars 207 million, respectively, in 2016. Meanwhile,

foreign investments in Treasury bills amounted to a

moderate net inflow of US dollars 36 million in 2016.

Hence, on a cumulative basis, government securities

other than ISBs recorded a net outflow of US dollars

531 million in 2016, in comparison to a net outflow of

US dollars 903 million in 2015.

5.7.3 Other Investment

Currency and Deposits

Net incurrence of liabilities in the form of

currency and deposits recorded a significant

decrease, while net acquisition of assets as

currency and deposits marginally increased

in 2016. Currency and deposit related liabilities

decreased primarily as a result of the settlement

of the international swap facility arrangement,

amounting to US dollars 700 million in June 2016.

The balance portion of the international swap facility

of US dollars 400 million also matured in December

2016, but a new swap facility for the same amount

was obtained within the same month. Meanwhile,

currency and deposits liabilities held by deposit

taking corporations increased by US dollars 92

million in 2016. Consequently, total net incurrence

of liabilities in the form of currency and deposits

decreased by US dollars 609 million in 2016, in

comparison to an increase of US dollars 1,457

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

5

million in 2015. Further, transactions relating to the

acquisition of assets in the form of currency and

deposits by deposit taking corporations increased

by US dollars 5 million in 2016, in comparison to an

increase of US dollars 143 million in 2015.

Loans

Net loan inflows in 2016 remained at a

similar level in comparison to the previous

year. This was mainly due to higher repayments of

foreign loan liabilities by the Central Bank, deposit

taking corporations and SOBEs, despite significant

foreign loan inflows to the government during

the year. Consequently, net inflows from foreign

loans amounted to US dollars 753 million in 2016

compared to US dollars 759 million in 2015.

Net inflows to the government in the

form of foreign loans, recorded a significant

increase in 2016. Accordingly, the net inflow to the

government amounted to US dollars 1,287 million

in 2016 compared to a net inflow of US dollars

470 million in 2015. This comprised total long

term loan inflows of US dollars 2,163 million and

repayments amounting to US dollars 876 million

during the year. Of total loan inflows, US dollars

1,278 million was in the form of project loans, US

dollars 700 million was from two foreign currency

term financing facilities and US dollars 185

million was in the form of programme financing.

Major project loan inflows to the government

in 2016 included the loans obtained for the

construction of extension of Southern expressway

section 1 and 2, integrated road investment

program-tranche 2, Hambantota hub development

project and Metro Colombo urban development

project. The two loans in the form of programme

financing consisted of US dollars 85 million from

the Government of Japan as a development

policy loan and US dollars 100 million from the

International Development Association of the

World Bank, as development policy financing

on competitiveness, transparency and financial

stability. These programme financing facilities were

conditional upon the proposed enactment of policy

actions by the local implementing agencies.

In June 2016, the Executive Board of the IMF

approved a three year EFF of SDR 1.1 billion,

approximately US dollars 1.5 billion, to Sri Lanka.

The EFF, which is equivalent to 185 per cent of the

country’s current quota with the IMF, is aimed at

supporting the BOP and the government’s reform

agenda. The first tranche under the EFF, amounting

to SDR 120 million (approximately US dollars 169

million), was made available to Sri Lanka in June

2016 and a similar amount was made available

as the second tranche in November 2016, upon

the successful completion of the first programme

review. Further, the Central Bank continued to

repay liabilities to the IMF under the Stand-By

Arrangement (SBA) facility obtained in 2009, with

total repayments amounting to US dollars 455

million in 2016. Repayments under the IMF SBA

facility are to conclude in mid-2017.

Foreign loans obtained by deposit taking

corporations recorded a net repayment, while

foreign loans of private corporations and

SOBEs recorded a net inflow in 2016. Net

foreign loan inflows to deposit taking corporations,

which consist of licensed commercial banks

(LCBs), licensed specialised banks (LSBs) and

licensed finance companies (LFCs), recorded a net

repayment of US dollars 507 million, compared to

a net inflow of US dollars 787 million in 2015. This

is a sharp reversal from the previous years where

the banking sector continuously received foreign

financing for their business operations. Further,

private corporations and SOBEs, classified under

the other sector in the financial account of the BOP,

recorded a net inflow of foreign loans amounting

to US dollars 96 million. Foreign loan inflows to

the other sector consisted of loan inflows of US

dollars 637 million to private corporations and US

dollars 21 million to SOBEs in 2016. Meanwhile,

repayments of existing foreign loans consisted

of US dollars 362 million by private corporations

and US dollars 200 million by SOBEs in 2016.

The majority of debt repayments by SOBEs were

related to loans of the Puttalum Coal Power Plant,

the Mattala International Airport, the Hambantota

port project and SriLankan Airlines.

Trade Credit and Advances and Other Accounts Receivable / Payable

Trade credit and advances received by

residents increased, while trade credit and

advances given to non-residents declined

in 2016. The trade credit received increased by

US dollars 109 million in 2016, compared to a

decrease of US dollars 401 million in 2015. The

net incurrence of liabilities through trade credits

received included US dollars 95 million received

by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and US

dollars 14 million received by private corporations

during the year. Meanwhile, net acquisition of

assets on trade credit and advances given by Sri

Lankan exporters to their trading partners and by

the banking sector decreased by US dollars 67

million in 2016. This comprised a decline in trade

credits given by private corporations and the

banking sector amounting to US dollars 64 million

and US dollars 3 million, respectively. Further,

other accounts payable, mainly consisting of Asian

Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities managed by the

Central Bank recorded a net increase of US dollars

55 million, while other accounts receivable to LCBs

recorded a net increase of US dollars 379 million

in 2016.

5.7.4 Reserve Assets

Transactions related to reserve assets

recorded a decline in 2016, in line with the

decrease in the stock of the reserve assets

during the year. Reserve transactions declined

by US dollars 472 million in 2016, on a net basis,

compared to the increase of US dollars 354 million

in 2015. In addition, reserve transactions during

the year consisted of the decline in currency and

deposits by US dollars 1,267 million, the decline

in Special Drawing Rights (SDR) by US dollars 5

million and an increase in debt securities by US

dollars 800 million.

5.8 Overall Balance

The overall balance of the BOP, which

reflects the change in net international reserves

during the period under review, recorded a deficit

in 2016. The overall balance recorded a deficit of

US dollars 500 million in 2016, in comparison to a

deficit of US dollars 1,489 million recorded in 2015.

As such, net international reserves also declined to US

dollars 4,529 million as at end 2016, from US dollars

5,029 million as at end 2015, with both the reserve

asset position and the reserve related liability position

declining during the year. The deficit in the overall

balance reflects the continuous pressure on the

depletion of gross official reserves, contributed by

a widening current account deficit, foreign currency

debt repayments and significant intervention by the

Central Bank in the foreign exchange market in 2016.

5.9 International Investment Position

With regard to the country’s International

Investment Position (IIP), the external liability

position increased while the foreign asset position

declined as at end 2016. The total foreign asset position

declined to US dollars 10,086 million, primarily due to

the reduction in the reserve asset position, despite an

increase in asset positions in direct investment and the

other accounts receivable. Meanwhile, the total liability

position increased to US dollars 55,036 million as at end

2016, an increase of US dollars 1,295 million from the

total liability position as at end 2015. The outstanding

liability position increased primarily due to the new

issuance of an ISB by the government, foreign loan

inflows to the government, trade credits received by

residents and a modest increase in the ACU liabilities

of the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the outstanding liability

position of direct investments, currency and deposits of

the Central Bank, outstanding foreign loans of deposit

taking corporations and the Central Bank declined

during the year. Reflecting the decline in the foreign

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

asset position and the increase in the foreign liability

position, the net liability position of the IIP increased

from US dollars 43,006 million as at end 2015 to US

dollars 44,949 million as at end 2016. Sri Lanka’s net

IIP continued to worsen, reflecting the continuous

dependence of foreign financing to finance the current

account deficit, in the backdrop of relatively low inflows

in the form of direct investments and other non-debt

creating inflows to the financial account.

5.9.1 Direct Investment Position

The direct investment asset position increased

while the direct investment liability position

declined in 2016. The direct investment asset position

increased from US dollars 817 million as at end 2015 to

US dollars 1,136 million as at end 2016, reflecting the

increase in investments in equity and investment fund

shares by Sri Lankan companies abroad. Meanwhile,

the direct investment liability position declined to US

dollars 9,745 million by end 2016, despite the BOP

recording a net inflow of direct investments in 2016.

This was primarily due to the reduction in the direct

investment equity position, as a result of market price

reduction of around US dollars 1.2 billion incurred by

most of the publicly listed companies in 2016. This

loss is around 10 per cent of Sri Lanka’s total direct

investment position, which is in line with the decline in

the All Share Price Index (ASPI) of the CSE by a similar

percentage during the year. The top five sources in

terms of direct investment liability stock position as

at end 2016 were the Netherlands, India, Malaysia,

China and Switzerland. However, the liability position

of debt instruments increased, reflecting the increase

in advances by direct investors.

5.9.2 Portfolio Investment Position

The portfolio investment liability position

increased with the proceeds from the issuance

of the dual-tranche ISB, while equity inflows

remained subdued in 2016. The portfolio investment

liability stock position, which consists of the outstanding

equity and debt securities, increased from US dollars

12,331 million as at end 2015 to US dollars 13,772

million as at end 2016. The portfolio investment equity

position increased to US dollars 1,507 million, while

the debt securities position increased to US dollars

12,265 million as at end of the year. The outstanding

debt securities of the government increased due to the

issuance of an ISB. However, with the anticipation of,

and the subsequent increase in the interest rates in the

United States, there were significant outflows of foreign

investments from rupee denominated government

securities and SLDBs held by non-residents. This

resulted in a moderation of the increase in outstanding

total government debt securities held by non-residents

as at end 2016. Meanwhile, the debt security liability

position of deposit taking corporations recorded

a marginal increase by the end of the year due to

changes in market prices of international bonds issued

by the Bank of Ceylon and the National Savings Bank.

5.9.3 Other Investment Position

Currency and Deposits

The currency and deposits asset position

increased marginally while the liability position

recorded a decline as at end 2016. The currency and

deposit liability position of the Central Bank declined

from US dollars 1,105 million as at end 2015 to US

dollars 403 million as at end 2016, primarily due to the

settlement of the international swap arrangement of US

dollars 700 million during the year. The currency and

deposit liability position of deposit taking corporations

increased to US dollars 2,039 million from US dollars

1,946 million recorded as at end 2015. The currency

and deposits asset position, which comprises the asset

position of the deposit taking corporations, increased

marginally to US dollars 706 million as at end 2016.

Loans

The foreign loan liability position in the IIP

increased as at end 2016 primarily due to the

increase in the foreign loan liability position of

the government. The foreign loan liability position

increased from US dollars 25,936 million as at end

2015 to US dollars 26,530 million as at end 2016.

The increase in the foreign loan liability position of the

government to US dollars 17,295 million was a result

of new project loans, two new foreign currency term

financing facilities and two new programme loans

obtained by the government. The outstanding foreign

loans of deposit taking corporations decreased

for the first time in the last five years, as a result of

moderate loan inflows to the banking sector amidst

continuous loan repayments. The outstanding liability

position of the Central Bank declined due to the net

effect of decrease in liabilities related to the IMF SBA

facility, despite an increase in liabilities due to the

first two tranches of the IMF EFF facility. The foreign

loan liability stock position of the other sector, which

includes the private sector and SOBEs, increased

marginally with an increase in both disbursements

and repayments during the year.

Trade Credit and Advances

The trade credit and advances asset position

declined while the liability position increased in

2016. The outstanding trade credit and advances

liability position, which consists of trade credit and

advances of the private sector, increased from US

dollars 1,375 million as at end 2015 to US dollars

1,483 million as at end 2016. The outstanding

asset position of trade credit and advances, which

reflects the trade credit and advances given by

deposit taking corporations and the private sector

declined to US dollars 610 million as at end 2016

from US dollars 677 million as at end 2015.

Other Accounts Receivable/Payable and Special Drawing Rights

The outstanding position of other accounts

receivable as well as other accounts payable

increased in 2016. The outstanding position

of other accounts receivable, of deposit taking

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

corporations, increased from US dollars 1,236

million as at end 2015 to US dollars 1,615 million

as at end 2016. Meanwhile, the outstanding

position of other accounts payable also increased

to US dollars 533 million as at end 2016, with the

increase in ACU related liabilities of the Central

Bank. Further, the SDR liability position declined

marginally to US dollars 532 million as at end 2016.

5.9.4 Reserve Asset Position

Sri Lanka’s gross official reserve assets

position declined as at end 2016 to US dollars

6.0 billion from US dollars 7.3 billion recorded

at end of 2015. The gross official reserve assets

at end 2016 was equivalent to 3.7 months of

imports of goods and 3.1 months of imports of

goods and services. The decline in gross official

reserves was mainly due to the foreign currency

debt service payments, settlement of a portion

of the foreign currency swap arrangement,

repayments of the IMF SBA and the supply of

liquidity to the domestic foreign exchange market

through Central Bank intervention. The total foreign

assets, which comprise gross official reserves

and foreign assets of deposit taking corporations,

declined to US dollars 8.4 billion at end 2016, from

US dollars 9.3 billion at end 2015. The increase in

foreign assets of deposit taking corporations during

the year abated a large depletion of total foreign

5.10 External Debt and Debt Servicing

5.10.1 External Debt

The total external debt of the country increased

by US dollars 1.7 billion in 2016. Consequently, the

total external debt stock increased from US dollars 44.8

billion as at end 2015 to US dollars 46.6 billion as at

end 2016. The increase in external debt was primarily

due to the increase in government external debt by US

dollars 2.5 billion in 2016. External borrowings by the

government increased in 2016 due to the issuance of

an ISB, two foreign currency term financing facilities

and project and programme loans, although there were

disinvestments by foreign investors in the government

securities market. Meanwhile, the outstanding external

debt of the Central Bank reduced by US dollars 801

million with the repayment of a portion of the foreign

currency swap liability and the repayment of the IMF

SBA. Further, outstanding external debt of deposit

taking corporations, private corporations and SOBEs,

and intra company debt of direct investment enterprises

amounted to US dollars 8,790 million, US dollars 5,774

million and US dollars 2,802 million, respectively, in

2016.

The total outstanding external debt as a

percentage of GDP increased to 57.3 per cent

as at end 2016 compared to 55.7 per cent as

at end 2015, primarily due to the increase in

government external debt. The outstanding

position of government external debt amounted to

58.4 per cent of total external debt as at end 2016,

compared to 55.0 per cent recorded as at end

2015. Further, long term debt, as a percentage of

total external debt, increased to 84.2 per cent as

at end 2016, compared to 82.9 per cent as at end

2015, indicating a gradual trend in moving towards

longer term maturities. The continued rise in Sri

Lanka’s external debt remains a concern in the

external sector, particularly in view of the expected

increase in the cost of borrowing as a result of likely

increase in the global interest rates.

5.10.2 Foreign Debt Service Payments

Capital payments on Sri Lanka’s external

debt obligations moderated while interest

payments increased in 2016. Capital repayments

on external debt amounted to US dollars 3,157

million in 2016 compared to US dollars 3,435 million

in 2015. There was a notable decline in capital

repayments of government securities compared

to the previous year, since the repayment of

government securities in 2015 included an ISB

of US dollars 500 million in 2015. However,

repayments of the Central Bank increased

with the settlement of foreign currency swaps

along with the repayments for the IMF SBA

in 2016. Interest payments on outstanding

external debt obligations increased from US

dollars 1,190 million in 2015 to US dollars

1,209 million in 2016. The increase in interest

payments was mainly due to the expansion in

interest payments made by the private sector

and deposit taking corporations.

Total external debt service payments

as a percentage of export of merchandise

and services declined in 2016. As a result

of the decline in total debt service payments,

coupled with an increase in export of goods

and services, debt service payments as a

percentage of export of goods and services

declined to 25.0 per cent in 2016 compared

to 27.3 per cent in 2015. Meanwhile, global

interest rates are expected to gradually rise

with the increase in the interest rates by the

US Federal Reserve, thus leading to higher

borrowing costs in the coming years.

5.11 Exchange Rate Movements

The external value of the Sri Lankan

rupee continued to depreciate in 2016. The

Sri Lankan rupee, which depreciated by 0.82

per cent in the first half of the year, depreciated

at a higher rate of 3.04 per cent in the second

half. The relatively low depreciation of the rupee

in the first half was supported by the supply of

foreign exchange liquidity by the Central Bank,

amounting to US dollars 1,093 million, on a

net basis. However, the rupee depreciated at a

higher rate with the curtailment in intervention

by the Central Bank with a net absorption of

US dollars 325 million during the second half

of the year. A substantial amount of the foreign

exchange supplied during the second half was

to partially ease the pressure arising due to the

disinvestment by non-resident investors in the

government securities market, particularly during

the last quarter of the year. This outflow from

the government securities market was driven by

the expectation and the subsequent increase in

interest rates by the US Federal Reserve Bank.

Throughout the year, with these developments,

the rupee depreciated by 3.83 per cent against

the dollar from Rs. 144.06 as at end 2015, to

Rs. 149.80 as at end 2016. In addition, the

annual average exchange rate depreciated by

6.64 per cent to Rs. 145.60 against the dollar in

2016. This trend of depreciation was consistent

to some extent with the demand and supply

conditions in the domestic foreign exchange

market as the modest levels of inflows with the

decline in exports of goods and the moderate

growth in workers’ remittances were insufficient

to meet the demand arising from higher imports

and foreign debt service payments. As such, the

supply of foreign exchange by the Central Bank

resulted in the depletion of reserves. Therefore,

the replenishing of international reserve level

is vital in reducing the country’s vulnerability to

external shocks.

In 2016, the rupee depreciated against all

major currencies except the pound sterling,

which depreciated substantially following

the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016. Accordingly,

reflecting the movements in the cross currency

exchange rates against the US dollar in

international markets, the rupee depreciated

against the euro by 0.32 per cent, the Indian

rupee by 1.72 per cent, the Japanese yen by

7.05 per cent, while appreciating against the

pound sterling by 16.04 per cent. Consequently,

the rupee also depreciated against the SDR by

0.87 per cent during the year.

5.11.1 Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates

The 5-currency and the 24-currency Real

Effective Exchange Rate (REER, 2010=100)

indices appreciated during the year, reflecting

an erosion in the external competitiveness

of the currency. REER indices, which take

the variation in nominal exchange rates in the

baskets into account, as well as the inflation

differentials among countries, were recalculated

using the newly rebased Colombo Consumer

Price Index (2013=100). Accordingly, both

5-currency and 24-currency REER indices

recorded an appreciation of 2.83 per cent and

2.70 per cent, respectively, by the end of the year.

The relatively high level of domestic inflation in

Sri Lanka, in comparison to the overall inflation

level of its trading partners and competitors, has

largely contributed towards the appreciation of the

REER indices in 2016. Meanwhile, the Nominal

Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) index for the

5-currency basket appreciated marginally by

0.23 per cent, while the same for the 24-currency

basket recorded a marginal depreciation of 0.95

per cent during the year.

5.11.2 Developments in the Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The transaction volumes in the

domestic foreign exchange market grew

in 2016. Accordingly, the volume of inter-

bank foreign exchange transactions at US

dollars 14,780 million during 2016 grew,

when compared to US dollars 13,600 million

in 2015. Although the total volume of spot

transactions decreased to US dollars 6,072

million (41.1 per cent of total transactions) in

2016, in comparison to US dollars 6,867 million

in 2015, the total volume of forward transactions

increased significantly to US dollars 8,709 million

in 2016 from US dollars 6,732 million in 2015.

Meanwhile, the Central Bank intervened in the

domestic foreign exchange market by supplying

US dollars 768 million on a net basis in 2016 as to

abate a significant depreciation of the exchange

rate, amidst a large mismatch in supply and

demand for foreign exchange. This included

an absorption of US dollars 1,132 million and a

supply of US dollars 1,900 million during 2016.

However, the Central Bank intervention in 2016

was lower when compared to the previous year,

in which the Central Bank sold US dollars 3,429

million and purchased US dollars 179 million.

The lower level of net supply was particularly due

to the improvement in the second half of 2016,

where the Central Bank limited its intervention

largely due to the demand arising from non-

resident foreign investors in the government

securities market.

During 2016, participants in the domestic

foreign exchange market indicated

depreciation expectations of the exchange

rate in the near term, as reflected in the

movements of forward premia and the Net

Open Position (NOP) of commercial banks.

Accordingly, reflecting market expectations of a

depreciation in the exchange rate, the forward

premia for one-month contracts remained

above the average interest rate differentials

during 2016. However, forward premia for three-

months and six-months remained below interest

rate differentials during the year, indicating

expectations of an improvement in foreign

exchange earnings. Meanwhile, the NOP of

commercial banks also remained at a positive

level on average during the year, indicating near-

term depreciation expectations of the market.

1. Introduction

The openness of a country to the global economy, i.e., the extent to which the free flow of foreign exchange is allowed, is a specific macroeconomic policy because it is neither feasible nor practical for most of the countries to be self-sufficient. Accordingly, the extent of the purchase/sale of foreign currencies by residents or purchase/sale of local currencies by non-residents is decided by government policy, with a view to protecting a country’s currency and its external reserves, which results in either foreign exchange controls or relaxations.

2. Sri Lankan Experience

Sri Lanka introduced exchange controls in 1944. The Department of Exchange Control was set up during World War II. It underwent several changes according to the varying needs of such time. Its operations were merged with the Department of Imports and Exports in two instances and the responsibilities of both departments were placed with one official. At the time of setting up the Central Bank it has been considered wiser to let exchange control remain the ultimate responsibility of the government, as it impinges directly upon and affects so pervasively the privacy of the general public. Hence, it was recommended to the Minister of Finance that Central Bank assumes the Ministry’s functions of the then Exchange Control Department as agent of the government. Accordingly, in 1950, when the Central Bank was set up the Department of Exchange Control came under the Central Bank. The Exchange Control Act, No. 24 of 1953 (ECA), which is the current law for exchange controls, was enacted on 15 August 1953. Accordingly, as of date, provisions of the ECA govern the matters relating to foreign exchange. Key provisions of ECA are as follows:

a. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, as the agent of the government, is responsible for carrying out the provisions of the ECA under directions issued by the Minister of Finance.

b. The Exchange Control Department (ECD) was established for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the ECA. Accordingly, the Controller of Exchange (CE), as the head of the ECD, or another designated officer is empowered on his behalf to exercise or perform any powers, duties and functions authorised or required to be exercised or performed by the Central Bank, by any provision of ECA, subject to the direction and control of the Governor.

c. The CE can delegate the granting of permission under the ECA to an Authorised Dealer (AD) by issue of Directions to such effect. Any commercial bank may be authorised by the Minister of Finance to act as an AD.

h. The CE can call for information and search premises with respect to matters falling within the purview of the ECA.

i. The Central Bank can investigate any alleged violations of the ECA and either impose fines or take legal action against such offenders.

3. Key Milestones of Liberalising Exchange Controls in Sri Lanka

3.1. With a view of addressing the problems associated with the Balance of Payments, a rigorous system of exchange controls was introduced in 1961. Accordingly, licenses that acted as exchange permits were issued by the Controller of Imports and Exports. All imports and exports were subject to certain regulations. Only the goods classified as essential were permitted to be imported.

3.2. From 1970 to 1977, a dual exchange rate system was prevailed in addition to exchange and import controls. Under this system, essential imports were allowed under an official rate and other imports had to be done at higher rates.

3.3. In November 1977, the exchange rate system was liberalised as part of the new government's economic reforms, introduced under open economic policies. This is considered as the commencement of the current phase of liberalising the current account.

3.4. The liberalisation of the current account was accelerated since 1993 and in 1994 all current account transactions were liberalised, as a consequence of accepting Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement in 1994. Accordingly, Licensed Commercial Banks (i.e. Authorised Dealers in foreign exchange) were permitted to release foreign exchange for such transactions, free of any exchange restrictions.

3.5. Subsequent to the liberalisation of the current account, the Central Bank has gradually relaxed capital account transactions with the objective of achieving greater efficiency in the conduct of international financial transactions.

5. Way Forward

Consequent to the liberalisation of economic and trade policies since late 1970s, Sri Lanka has gradually opened up opportunities for cross-border capital flows. Increased capital inflows, in particular, supplement financing for domestic investment while providing opportunities for integrating with international capital markets. The attractiveness of a country as a preferred destination for foreign investment inter-alia depends on the degree of openness of that county’s capital account. Hence, the ability to remit in and remit out funds without prior approvals, cumbersome and time consuming procedures and restrictions is an important factor in promoting and attracting foreign investments.

As summarised above, foreign exchange regulations related to the capital account have been relaxed gradually with the objectives of achieving greater efficiency in the conduct of international financial transactions and further facilitating economic activities. However, there is still a general perception that capital inflows to and outflows from the country are quite restrictive. In order to address this situation, the Government in its recent Budget announcements has declared that a new law will be introduced. Accordingly, the preparatory work to introduce a new foreign exchange management framework is currently in progress and the new Foreign Exchange Bill has been published in the Government Gazette Notification before presenting to the Parliament.
