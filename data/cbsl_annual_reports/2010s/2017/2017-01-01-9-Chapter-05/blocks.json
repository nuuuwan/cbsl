Although the common notion is that there is a bi-directional relationship between export growth and economic growth, this relationship has not been seen in relation to Sri Lanka. This was experienced between 2000-2016, wherein GDP grew by a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.4 per cent, while exports grew by only 4.0 per cent (CAGR). Sri Lanka's economic growth during the recent past has mainly been pushed by the expansion of domestic demand rather than increased exports.",

    "text": "The high level of economic growth witnessed during the period 2005-2012, which was mainly due to the expansion in domestic demand, started to stagnate within a 4-5 per cent band from 2013 onwards, emphasising that external demand is paramount for a sustained pace of economic growth in a small economy like Sri Lanka. The widening trade and current account deficits and an increase reliance on unsustainable levels of foreign borrowings were an inevitable consequence of growth which was dependent on non-tradables and domestic demand. This provides compelling evidence that comprehensive strategies, which focus on the promotion of high-value exports, are essential to achieve a sustainable external current account balance and high growth. In addition, the generation of higher export revenues will also serve as a buffer for the accumulated stock of medium and short term foreign liabilities, and can also be utilised for the stabilisation of the exchange rate, thereby contributing to the building up of a sustainable level of reserves that can help improve the country's economic resilience. Furthermore, a renewed focus on exports can help divert investments to more efficient sectors of the economy, thus raising productivity. Growth in exports also entails several other benefits, such as inflow of new technology, employment creation, greater economies of scale and expansion of the productive resource base of the economy.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka was ahead of its regional peers in liberalising the economy in 1977. The adoption of liberal economic policies, such as private sector driven development, export led growth and encouragement of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), led to the immediate realisation of notable improvements in foreign trade and trade openness.1 Trade openness, which was 36.4 per cent in 1977 nearly doubled to 72.2 per cent by 1979, while exports as a percentage of GDP, which was 18.7 per cent in 1977 increased significantly to 29.2 per cent by 1979. This change in policy direction resulted in substantial improvements in export earnings. Export earnings increased from US dollars 767 million in 1977 to US dollars 5,522 million",

As a result, the trade deficit expanded to US dollars 9,090 million by 2016. In spite of the turnaround seen in the immediate aftermath of the adoption of liberal policies, Sri Lanka\u2019s international trade performance has been lacklustre, regressing to levels that were seen during the pre-liberalisation era.

Despite the change in composition, exports continue to be concentrated on two traditional products, namely, garments and tea, which account for more than half of the export basket, reflecting the limited product diversification of the export sector. The export sector also shows a lack of diversification in terms of markets. Europe and the USA continue to account for approximately two-thirds of total exports. Further, approximately 70 per cent of tea exports are to the Middle-East and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), for which demand is sensitive to income earned through oil exports.

Comprehensive export promotion programmes such as export subsidies, export credit schemes with preferential interest rates and tax incentives have been implemented to promote exports. These strategies were complemented by the creation of a conducive macroeconomic environment with low and stable inflation, low interest rates and a competitive exchange rate. Stakeholder engagement was also a central aspect of the overall promotion strategy. Accordingly, regular export promotion meetings were held with stakeholders, including the government, industry professionals, trade facilitators and business personnel so as to make cohesive decisions in a timely manner. An appropriate regulatory environment was also created wherein laws that recognised private ownership were introduced to encourage the private sector to evolve as the engine of growth. New laws that enabled the liberalisation of the capital account and encouraged foreign investment were also introduced, resulting in a surge in FDI flows. An open door policy, introduced as a result of the liberalisation of the economy, paved the way for these countries to develop synergies with developed economies, while gaining assistance on various fronts from international organisations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank.",

As a result, the share of value added industries increased in tandem with product diversification, while the share of labour-intensive industrial and agricultural exports declined. Export strategies also comprised many country-specific aspects. For example, Vietnam, which was a centrally planned agro-based economy, initiated several economic reform policies in 1986, which led to a transformation of the export sector and the economy as a whole. Although Vietnam introduced several reforms to its large agricultural sector by way of policies related to the development of high-value agro industrial products, such as coffee and rubber and privatisation of state-owned land, the reform agenda prioritised the industrial sector. Although these led to a reduction in share of agricultural exports and the sectoral contribution of GDP, the efficiency of the agriculture sector improved, resulting in the country\u2019s transformation from a net importer to a net exporter of the agricultural products. In the case of Vietnam and other countries, such as South Korea and Thailand, after a substantial level of growth in exports was achieved, policy priorities shifted away from sector-oriented support towards function-oriented support. This led to comprehensive assistance for Research and Development (R&D), which eventually led to significant leaps in technological innovation, resulting in the increase in exports of technology-based products. However, over the long term, the South Korean government withdrew much of the focused assistance provided to the export sector in order to strengthen the market mechanism and to enable domestic players to compete on a level playing field. On the other hand, although Bangladesh\u2019s exports had grown by more than 5 times since 2000 with the benefit of EU-EBA4 facility, resulting in the steady improvement of exports to GDP and trade openness, product diversification continued to remain neglected, where garments currently account for about 90 per cent of total exports. Similar to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh\u2019s main export destinations are the USA and the EU, making its external sector highly vulnerable to unfavourable developments in these regions. The experiences of these countries also highlight the importance of policy consistency to enable all stakeholders to make sustainable decisions for the long-term. However, such polices have also been flexible enough to adapt to current and future developments in the domestic and global environment.",

    "text": "Interest and exchange rates are the key prices in an economy that provide incentives for producers and consumers to engage in economic activities in the international and domestic arenas. As financing cost is one of the key factors affecting both production and export activity, maintaining low interest rates in the economy would support to sustain the country's competitive edge in export markets. A low and stable inflation environment would ensure the maintenance of low interest rates. Moreover a subdued and stable inflation environment is also essential for investors to make informed long-term decisions. Given that exchange rate policy is closely linked to the trade outcome, a good trade outcome cannot be expected from a misaligned exchange rate. Sri Lanka has endured prolonged periods of over-valued exchange rates that created a bias against exports. Keeping the nominal exchange rate overvalued, has led to large Balance of Payments (BOP) deficits and loss of reserves that have led the government to recourse to borrowings at commercial interest rates thereby increasing external debt. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has already announced its intention to maintain flexibility in the nominal exchange rate, which reflects a competitive Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) Index eventually being around 100. Such a policy will ensure that the exchange rate is fairly valued and is largely determined by market forces while facilitating the conduct of monetary policy of the country. It is important to highlight that achieving fiscal sustainability is crucial for maintaining low nominal interest rates and a competitive exchange rate.",

A more outward-oriented trade policy can amplify the gains from rebalancing towards a stronger role for the private sector in the economy, and enhancing overall economic growth.

Import restrictions cannot correct an imbalance in the current account deficit of the BOP in the long run unless county accepts lower growth, employment and incomes (ie the low growth, high unemployment and stagnation in real income seen prior to the 1977 liberalisation package). In addition, import restrictions can contribute to widening the trade deficit by discouraging exports as import restrictions are a tax on exports. The restricted trade regime had led to lower production capacity and lower competitiveness in all sectors of the economy, leading to lower comparative advantage for Sri Lankan products, resulting in Sri Lanka losing ground in the international arena.",

Several measures, spearheaded by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT) and the Export Development Board (EDB) are currently underway. The National Export Strategy, initiated by the EDB, is a collaborative effort of the state and the private sector and provides a five-year action-oriented framework for the development of trade and competitiveness. Simultaneously, a National Trade Policy has been drafted with the objective of attracting more export-oriented FDI, to improve trade logistics, to make customs procedures more transparent and efficient, and to implement other measures to boost a firm's ability to compete in the global market. By recognising the need for broad-based institutional support, the government has already taken steps to create two agencies, the Agency for International Trade (AfIT) and the Agency for Development (AfD). The AfIT is rectifying issues in existing trade pacts with the Indian subcontinent while exploring an economic partnership agreement with India, to use Sri Lanka\u2019s improved investment climate to attract investment that caters to the entire market of the subcontinent. The AfIT is also pursuing new bilateral and multilateral trade opportunities beyond the subcontinent especially with China, Singapore, the EU and the USA, which cater to a market of about 3 billion, complying with the non-aligned foreign policy of the government. The AfD, on the other hand, is expected to contribute to development efforts by collaborating with the private sector to identify constraints on the development process and by building multi-functional teams that can work across sectors to resolve issues to enable the private sector to enhance capabilities, engage in product development and foster export growth.

It underwent several changes according to the varying needs of such time. Its operations were merged with the Department of Imports and Exports in two instances and the responsibilities of both departments were placed with one official. At the time of setting up the Central Bank it has been considered wiser to let exchange control remain the ultimate responsibility of the government, as it impinges directly upon and affects so pervasively the privacy of the general public. Hence, it was recommended to the Minister of Finance that Central Bank assumes the Ministry\u2019s functions of the then Exchange Control Department as agent of the government. Accordingly, in 1950, when the Central Bank was set up the Department of Exchange Control came under the Central Bank. The Exchange Control Act, No. 24 of 1953 (ECA), which is the current law for exchange controls, was enacted on 15 August 1953. Accordingly, as of date, provisions of the ECA govern the matters relating to foreign exchange. Key provisions of ECA are as follows:",

Increased capital inflows, in particular, supplement financing for domestic investment while providing opportunities for integrating with international capital markets. The attractiveness of a country as a preferred destination for foreign investment inter-alia depends on the degree of openness of that county\u2019s capital account. Hence, the ability to remit in and remit out funds without prior approvals, cumbersome and time consuming procedures and restrictions is an important factor in promoting and attracting foreign investments.",

However, there is still a general perception that capital inflows to and outflows from the country are quite restrictive. In order to address this situation, the Government in its recent Budget announcements has declared that a new law will be introduced. Accordingly, the preparatory work to introduce a new foreign exchange management framework is currently in progress and the new Foreign Exchange Bill has been published in the Government Gazette Notification before presenting to the Parliament.",
