4.1 OverviewT

he general price level, as measured in

terms of both the National Consumer

Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) and

Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI,

2013=100), compiled by the Department of

Census and Statistics (DCS), followed an

overall increasing trend, with mixed movements

during 2016. The movement of the general price

level was largely in line with the price movements

of the Food category. Price developments in the

Non-food category, mainly led by government

tax adjustments introduced on several occasions

during the year, also triggered movements in

the general price level. Furthermore, prices of

imported consumer goods exerted some degree

of upward pressure on domestic prices, due to

both the increase in prices in international markets

compared to the subdued price environment

that prevailed in 2015 and the weakening of the

domestic currency. Meanwhile, the underlying price

movements, as measured by both the NCPI Core

and CCPI Core, also followed an increasing trend

during the period, signaling the demand pressure

in the economy while the changes made to the tax

structure also contributed to this increase. Overall,

the increasing trend of the general price level and

the underlying price movement during the period

was also noticeable in the Producer’s Price Index

(PPI). Meanwhile, wages increased in nominal

terms across all sectors of the economy although a

real wage erosion was observed in the Public and

Formal Private Sectors. On the employment front,

the overall unemployment rate declined compared

to the previous year, supported by an increase in

job opportunities in the economy. Unemployment

among youth, females and persons with higher

educational attainment continued to remain at

higher levels. Foreign employment opportunities,

as reflected by the number of departures for foreign

employment declined in 2016.

NCPI was 112.0 index points in January 2016 and

increased to 118.0 index points in December 2016.

The NCPI, which declined from January 2016 to

March 2016, increased from April 2016 to June

2016. However, it declined in July 2016 and August

2016, after which it reversed its trend and moved

on a gradual increasing path. The NCPI largely

followed the movements of the prices of Food

category. It also reflected mixed trends largely in

accordance with the introduction, suspension and

re-introduction of government tax adjustments

during the year that mainly affected the movement

of the Non-food category.

Inflation as measured by the year-on-

year change in the NCPI, followed an overall

increasing trend with mixed movements during

2016. Year-on-year NCPI inflation increased at a

comparatively rapid pace in the first half of the year

and decelerated during the second half of 2016,

leading to an overall increasing trend. Year-on-

year NCPI inflation was -0.7 in January 2016, due

to broadly favourable domestic supply conditions

as well as the relatively high base in January

2015. The year-on-year NCPI inflation moved on

an increasing trend and peaked in June 2016,

reaching 6.4 per cent. The year-on-year NCPI

inflation increased in May and June 2016 due to the

impact of the increase in food prices led by adverse

weather conditions and the increase in non-food

prices resulting from the changes in government

taxes. In July and August 2016, year-on-year

NCPI inflation moved on an overall decelerated

trend, supported by some improvements in the

supply conditions of food items. The suspension of

government tax changes in July also contributed

marginally towards this decline. In November,

government tax changes were re-introduced, and

food prices were also on the rise due partly to the

drought conditions. Year-on-year NCPI inflation

settled around mid-single digit levels towards the

latter part of 2016. Meanwhile, annual average

NCPI inflation increased from 2.9 per cent in

January 2016 to 4.0 percent in December 2016.

Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI)

The CCPI (2013=100), which measures

the price developments of urban areas of the

Colombo district, also moved on an increasing

trend with mixed movements during 2016. The

Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) measure the overall price level of a basket of goods and services used by an average household. As consumption patterns change over time, CPIs should also accommodate such changes via a rebasing exercise. It is a widely accepted practice amongst international statistical agencies to rebase CPIs based on findings of surveys on consumption and expenditure patterns of consumers.

The history of CPIs in Sri Lanka dates back to 1939, when a Cost of Living Index representing the working class in Colombo was used to analyse trends in prices. The base period of this Colombo Working Class Cost of Living Index was November 1938-April 1939. Thereafter, in 1953, the first Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) was released as the official CPI in Sri Lanka by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the authority entrusted with the responsibility of compiling official CPIs. The base year of the first CCPI was 1952, where the basket of goods was selected based on patterns of consumption and expenditure revealed by findings of the Colombo Family Budget Survey conducted in 1949/50. Subsequently, the CCPI was rebased to 2002 and then to 2006/07, based on the findings of the Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIESs) conducted during the respective periods. The most recent rebasing has been carried out based on the findings of the HIES conducted during 2012/13.

BOX 05Evolution of Consumer Price Indices in Sri Lanka

DCS updated the base period of the CCPI to year 2013 from 2006/07. The new series of the CCPI was released in January 2017.

There are a number of key improvements and changes that have been introduced with each rebasing. The prominent change in indices over time is the transformation of the shares of food and non-food expenditure in the basket. The share of expenditure on food in CCPI (2013=100) is 28.2 per cent. This is a significant decline from 41.0 per cent in CCPI (2006/07=100) and 61.9 per cent in CCPI (1952=100). This clearly indicates that households in Colombo tend to spend a relatively higher share of their expenditure on non-food items at present, and this share has increased significantly over time. Nevertheless, as per the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), an average household representing the entire country spends 44.0 per cent of the total expenditure, on food.

NCPI (2013=100), which was released by the DCS in 2015, reflects the changes in the patterns of consumption and expenditure of consumers at the national level whereas CCPI reflects the changes in the patterns of consumption and expenditure of consumers in Colombo district. The recent rebasing of CCPI to 2013 aligns the base years of NCPI and CCPI and enables convenient comparisons of national and urban price trends.

CCPI was 110.0 index points in January 2016 and

increased to 114.7 index points in December 2016.

Year-on-year CCPI inflation also followed a trend

similar to NCPI inflation. As such, year-on-year

CCPI inflation was 1.7 per cent in January 2016,

peaked to 5.8 per cent in July 2016 and reached

4.5 per cent in December 2016. Meanwhile, annual

average CCPI inflation increased from 2.1 per cent

in January 2016 to 4.0 per cent in December 2016.

Price Movements in the Food Category

Price movements of the Food category were

largely in accordance with the developments in

the prices of Volatile Food1. Volatile Food prices

exhibited mixed movements, contributing largely

towards the increase in food inflation during the

period. Price pressures from rice and vegetables

remained benign during the early months of the

year due to favourable supply conditions. However,

inflationary pressure due to the increase in rice

prices was prominent during the latter part of the

year, due to the impact of the drought that prevailed

during the fourth quarter of the year. Meanwhile,

1 Volatile Food includes rice, meat, fresh fish and sea food, coconuts, fresh fruits, vegeta-bles, potatoes, onions and selected condiments.

prices of vegetables increased steadily during

April to July 2016, mainly due to supply disruptions

caused by floods. However, the drought that

prevailed during the latter part of the year had a

marginal upward pressure on vegetable prices.

Prices of fresh fish exhibited mixed movement

during the year with marine fishing maintained

and increased fresh water fishing during the year.

Prices of coconuts moved on a declining trend

until August 2016 and increased at a rapid pace

thereafter. Meanwhile, with a view of containing

the rising cost of living, the government announced

Maximum Retail Prices (MRPs) for 16 essential

food items in mid July 2016, though the impact of

these on prices was marginal.

Domestic prices of imported items increased

in 2016 compared to that of 2015. This increase

was led by both the increase in the prices of consumer

goods in the international markets and the weakening

of the domestic currency against a few major

currencies, as reflected by trade indices compiled by

the Central Bank. Prices of sugar, dhal and wheat flour

increased in the domestic market in 2016 compared

to the previous year. The price of a loaf of bread also

increased, subsequent to the price increase in wheat

flour. These price movements exerted some upward

pressure on the general price level. Moreover, the

Special Commodity Levy (SCL) on several imported

food commodities were also revised on several

occasions to balance the supply side developments.

The SCL on imported commodities such as potatoes,

red onions and big onions was increased to

discourage imports during the harvesting seasons, for

the benefit of local farmers. Furthermore, the SCL on

imported sugar was reduced substantially to 25 cents

per kilogram when the price ceiling was announced,

to maintain prices in the retail market. However, the

SCL on sugar was increased on several occasions

during the second half of the year, to encourage the

local production of sugar.

Price Movements in Non-food and other Categories

Price behaviour in Non-food and other

categories exhibited an overall upward trend

with mixed movements. These price behaviours

can be largely attributable to the periodic price

revisions as well as changes in prices due to

administrative interventions. Prices in Health and

Communication sub-categories increased due to

the changes in government taxes implemented in

2016. Meanwhile, in October 2016, the National

Medicines Regulatory Authority imposed MRPs

on 48 selected medicinal products. Within the

Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and other Fuels

sub-category, price of Liquid Petroleum Gas (L.P.

Gas) was reduced by Rs.25, with effect from 29

November 2016, as announced in the Budget

2017. Within the Transport sub category, bus fares

were revised upward by 6 per cent with effect from

1 August 2016.

Government tax revisions introduced during

several occasions in 2016 exerted a direct

impact on Non-food prices. In May 2016, the

Value Added Tax (VAT) rate was increased from

11 per cent to 15 per cent and the VAT exemptions

on several items in sub-categories in the consumer

price index baskets (Communication and some

items in Health) were removed. Accordingly, price

increases were observed in the relevant sub-groups

of Health and Communication sub-categories.

However, the VAT increase was suspended in July

2016. Nevertheless, a full downward adjustment

in prices was not observed in response to the

suspension of the VAT increase, particularly in the

prices of the Health sub-category. Thereafter, the

VAT increase was re-imposed in November 2016,

leading to an increase in prices of mainly the Non-

food items.

Core Inflation

Year-on-year core inflation in terms of

both the NCPI Core (2013=100) and CCPI Core

(2013=100) moved on an overall increasing

trend during the year, signaling the possible

demand pressure in the economy. With the

significant increase in the prices of Non-food items

due to the changes introduced to government

taxes, core inflation recorded a sharp increase in

May 2016. The sharp decline in year-on-year core

inflation during July and August 2016 was partly

due to the suspension of changes in government

taxes. Due to the re-imposition of government

taxes, core inflation increased again in November

and December 2016. Accordingly, NCPI Core

inflation, which was 3.0 per cent in January 2016,

peaked at 7.5 per cent in June 2016 and settled at

6.7 per cent by December 2016. Meanwhile, CCPI

Core inflation was 3.6 per cent in January 2016 and

reached 5.8 per cent in December 2016.

Demand side developments have resulted in

some degree of price pressure as reflected by the

increase in core inflation, particularly during the

early part of 2016. Credit to the private sector by the

banking sector grew at higher rates during 2015 and

2016, despite some deceleration during the second

half of 2016, in response to monetary tightening by

the Central Bank. Meanwhile, wages in the economy

also increased at higher rates, particularly in the

public sector during 2015 and the early part of 2016,

leading to a rise in real income levels. There were

several legislations that led to increases in wages

in the formal private sector during 2016. Wages in

the informal private sector also followed the trend in

public sector wages and formal private sector wage

developments. These factors contributed to some

degree of demand side pull on prices.

Inflation expectations remained stable and

exhibited some degree of response to monetary

and fiscal policy changes introduced during

the period. Inflation expectations of the corporate

sector respondents remained anchored around

mid-single digit levels and adjusted according to

monetary and fiscal policy changes introduced

during 2016. Inflation expectations of household

sector respondents also attuned to policy

changes, particularly, the government tax changes

introduced during the period. Inflation expectations

of the household sector respondents naturally

remain at a level higher than the expectations

of the corporate sector. As such, their inflation

expectations remained stable around upper single

digit levels.

Producer’s Price Index (PPI)

Producer price inflation as measured by the

movements in the PPI (2013 Q4=100) which

is compiled by the DCS, exhibited an overall

increasing trend during 2016. PPI covers

producer’s prices of Agriculture, Manufacturing

and Utilities (Electricity and Water Supply) sectors

of the economy. The year-on-year change in

the Agriculture and Manufacturing sub-indices

exhibited overall increasing trends during the

year. Meanwhile, the year-on-year change in the

Electricity and Water Supply sub-index moved on

a declining trend during 2016. This was mainly

due to the decline in the overall cost of production

of electricity that prevailed in 2016 compared to

2015, with the increase in low cost hydro power

generation, particularly during the rainy season of

the first half of 2016.

GDP Deflator

GDP deflator, which measures the price

movements of all domestically produced goods

and services in the overall economy, increased

due to the upward price movements in all

three major sectors of the economy. Prices of

the Agriculture, Industry and Services sectors

increased at 3.9 per cent, 0.5 per cent and 3.2 per

cent, respectively, during 2016, compared to 3.0

per cent, -0.1 per cent and 0.6 per cent in 2015.

Accordingly, the overall GDP deflator increased to

3.6 per cent in 2016, compared to 0.8 per cent in

2015. During 2016, both NCPI and CCPI inflation

remained at levels higher than the GDP deflator.

4.3 Wages

Significant changes were introduced to

align wages in line with recent economic

developments in the public and private

sectors during 2016. A new public sector salary

circular2 was issued to implement new salary

scales. Further, the Rs. 10,000 interim allowance

introduced in 2014 and 2015 was added to the

Wage indicators provide insights on possible inflationary pressures and cost dynamics in an economy and are used as early indicators of labour market and demand side developments. Wages set the demand trends in an economy through consumption, savings and investment decisions.

In a global context, statistics on wages are published in various forms across countries. For example, some countries compile specific wage rate indices while others compile average hourly earnings. The United States Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) defines a labour price index (Employment Cost Index) as an index designed to measure changes in the hourly compensation of a fixed “basket of jobs”. Labour Cost Index (LCI) of the Euro area is defined as the Laspeyres index of labour costs per hour worked, chain-linked annually and based upon a fixed structure of economic activity, with a current reference year of 2012 (ec.europa.eu, 2017). The United Kingdom (UK) publishes an Index of Labour Cost per Hour (ILCH), which is used as the only short term earnings per hour indicator in the UK. It is an important measure monitored by the Bank of England and UK Treasury as it can provide early indications of economic performance.

In Sri Lanka, the movement of public sector wages is monitored through the Public Sector Wage Rate Index (PSWRI). The base year of PSWRI is 2012 and it is compiled by obtaining relevant data from Public Administration Salary Circulars. The index monitors wage movements across four categories namely; Senior, Tertiary, Secondary and Primary employees in the public sector, in accordance with the Public Administration Salary Circulars.

BOX 06Measuring Wage Trends in the Economy

In the informal private sector, wages are determined by market forces and nominal wages get adjusted according to changes in demand and supply conditions in the labour market. Initially, wage movements of this segment of employees were analysed in terms of the movements of average daily wages. In 2014, using wage data captured from the Country Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS), an Informal Private Sector Wage Rate Index (IPSWRI) was introduced by the Central Bank with a base year of 2012. The IPSWRI facilitated the analysis of overall wage trends in the informal private sector. The compilation of the IPSWRI involves surveying of employees in around 4,250 activities each month, depending on the seasonality of employment.

Wage movements of the formal private sector are measured through the Wages Boards Wage Rate Index (WBWRI, 1978 Dec=100) compiled by the Department of Labour. The WBWRI has few drawbacks such as an obsolete base year and non-reprensentation of the

present structure of the economy. Also, the WBWRI is based on minimum wages of respective Wages Boards Trades, which could be far from the realistic wage levels determined based on various factors including demand for and supply of labour, regulatory requirements on minimum wages and trade union negotiations on wage levels in the formal private sector. While re-basing the WBWRI would address some of these issues, the index would continue to suffer from being based on minimum wages of Wages Boards Trades.

A well-functioning private sector essentially forms part of broad-based prosperity in an economy and is considered to be more efficient in utilising the factors of production. Therefore, it is timely and important that the formal private sector wage movements are monitored in a more robust manner, based on a more representative wage rate index. In this regard, the Central Bank is in the process of developing a new wage rate index based on the Laspeyres price index, in collaboration with the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF). In developing this index, wages of employees are considered to be proportionate to the statutory EPF contribution percentages. Separate sub-indices for Agriculture, Industry and Services sectors will be compiled in this process. As opposed to stipulated minimum wages by the Wages Boards used in the existing WBWRI, the proposed index would be based on the actual wages paid to employees. Therefore, it is presumed to be a reliable indicator for evidence based policy making and is expected to provide a more representative picture of wage pressures in the formal private sector.

A separate wage rate index for the semi-government sector employees is also proposed to be developed from the aggregate data made available by the EPF. The proposed wage rate indices for the formal private

sector and the semi-government sector, along with the current wage rate indices for the public and informal private sectors are expected to cover wage trends of the entire spectrum of employment and provide useful insights in terms of demand-side developments in the economy.

As such, these wage rate indices, along with labour market developments observed through quarterly Business Outlook Surveys (BOS) and monthly Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) surveys, can be used as leading indicators in the monetary policy formulation process.

For economic policy makers, movements of nominal wages remain an important signal to gauge the extent of possible inflationary pressures. Higher wage levels would normally indicate a higher disposable income, holding all other factors constant. Higher levels of income as a result of increased wages would lead to higher amounts of progressive taxes, thereby easing the pressure on the fiscal deficit as well. The mere increase in nominal wages, however, would not suffice to uplift the living standards of the working population. To achieve this objective, real wages would need to rise. On the other hand, a prolonged decline in real wages could also be a signal towards possible future wage pressures and a decline in labour productivity.

public sector wages were observed from March

2016 with the commencement of the payments

according to the new salary structures. For the

private sector, a National Minimum Wage3 of Rs.

10,000 was enacted with effect from 01 January

also expanded by increasing the ceiling from Rs.

Public Sector Wages

The nominal wages of public sector

employees, as measured by the Public Sector

Wage Rate Index (2012=100), increased in 2016.

This increase was mainly due to the step wise

increase in the interim allowance to Rs. 10,000

effected during 2015 and the inclusion of a portion

of the interim allowance to the basic salary in 2016,

which yielded a higher average wage index in 2016

compared to 2015. As a result, the overall nominal

wage rate index of public sector employees

increased by 3.9 per cent in 2016 compared to the

significant increase of 31.7 per cent recorded in the

2016. Consequently, real wages of employees in

the formal private sector declined in 2016, as the

percentage increase in the nominal wage rate index

remained insignificant during the period, while

employees in the informal private sector enjoyed

a real wage growth in 2016. With the expansion of

the construction sector, an increase of the wages

in masonry and carpentry trades was observed

owing to the increased demand for labour in these

sectors. On the other hand, the growth in wages

partly suggests higher levels of bargaining power

of workers in related activities, due to the shortage

of labour supply with required quality.

previous year. However, public sector employees

experienced a marginal real wage erosion of 0.1

per cent in 2016 compared to a significant 27.0

per cent increase in 2015, due to nominal wages

increasing at a rate marginally below the inflation

rate.

Private Sector Wages

Two major acts on the National Minimum

Wage and the Budgetary Relief Allowance

which were introduced by the government

led to an increase in the nominal wages of

employees in private sector. Nominal wages

of the employees in the formal private sector,

as measured by the minimum wage rate index

of employees whose wages are governed by

the Wages Boards Trades (1978 Dec=100),

increased marginally. Further, nominal wages

higher growth compared to the past 4 years.

Accordingly, the mid-year population in 2016 is

estimated at 21.203 million. Western province,

which is the leading contributor to the Gross

Domestic Product (GDP) accounted for 28.4 per

cent of the total population. Based on the age

structure of the population, the working age

population (age 15 and above) comprises 74.8

per cent of the total population. However, 16.5

per cent of the working age population are elders

(age 60 and above). These developments reflect

the low level of long run labour supply in terms of

population dynamics in the country, particularly

with the ageing population phenomenon.

Labour Force

Labour force, which is the key indicator of the

current labour supply of the economy, increased

during 2016, albeit it was not sufficient to

record a notable increase in the Labour Force

Participation Rate (LFPR). The labour force, which

is defined as the economically active population5

aged 15 years and above, increased by 1.2 per cent

during 2016 to 8.311 million, from 8.214 million in

2015. However, the LFPR, which is the ratio of the

labour force to the household population aged 15

years and above, remained at the same level of 53.8

per cent in 2016 as in 2015. This was due to the

similar increase in both the household population

aged 15 years and the labour force.

The gender gap in labour force participation

continued to remain in favour of the male labour

force in the country. The female LFPR was

recorded as 35.9 per cent during the year 2016,

while the male LFPR was 75.1 per cent during the

same period, which reflects that the willingness

of the females to participate in the labour force is

less than half of that of males. Over the years, the

female LFPR has shown signs of only marginal

improvements, leading to a steady level of overall

LFPR of around 54 per cent. The reasons for low

female LFPR, are lack of provisions for flexible

working hours or work-from-home facilities, lack

of regularised and proper child care facilities, a

higher share of household responsibilities being

shouldered by females and limitations on mobility

to and from work due to difficulties associated

with public transport. If this trend continues, the

adequate supply of labour to drive the economic

growth would be challenging in the future. Since

female LFPR is an indication of the health of the

labour market, apart from the overall LFPR and

the unemployment rate, a national level policy

action is required to fill such gaps in order to

attain maximum utilisation of the labour force and

inclusive growth. Industry specific practices, such

as recruiting a certain percentage of employees

with a gender balance from close proximities,

should be encouraged to attract more females

into the labour force and maximise the potential in

labour force participation.

Employers also stress that there is a

deficiency of labour supply in the economy, as

reflected by the results of business sentiment

surveys conducted by the Central Bank. As

per the survey findings, the intention to hire new

workers by employers had been positive over time

as the level of employment that existed in firms was

not adequate to carry out existing and expected

operations. The survey findings also reveal that

the availability of labour in the economy has

declined over time, requiring attention to address

the skills mismatch for future employment.

Employment

The key indicator of the fulfilled labour

demand of the economy, the number

employed, increased by 1.5 per cent to 7.948

million during 2016 compared to 7.831 million

during the previous year. The increase in total

employment was mainly caused by the expansion

in the Industry and Services activities in the

economy. However, employment in Agriculture

sector has declined owing to the contraction

observed in agriculture related activities during

the period under review, due to unfavourable

weather conditions. Accordingly, the Agriculture

sector contributed to 27.1 per cent of the total

employment, while the Industry and Services

sectors contributed to 26.4 per cent and 46.5 per

cent of the total employment, respectively.

The number employed in the Private

sector increased significantly, while all

other categories recorded declines in

employment during the period under review.

Accordingly, the number employed in categories

2016. Employer and Contributing family worker

categories have shown notable declines of 10.6

per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively, during

the overall impact is moderated by the 7.0 per

1,117,808. The Census excludes employees of

the subsidiaries of Semi Government Institutions

and the uniformed staff of Sri Lanka Army, Sri

Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Air Force. The Census

indicates a 30 per cent growth in public sector

employment since 2006.

Unemployment

The unemployment rate decreased to 4.4

per cent during 2016 from 4.7 per cent recorded

in 2015. During 2016, the total labour force has

grown by 1.2 per cent, while a decline of 5.4 per

cent was recorded in the unemployed population,

reflecting an increase in employment opportunities

in the economy during 2016 compared to 2015.

Accordingly, the absolute number of unemployed

males and females were 153,990 and 212,923,

respectively, for the period under review. The drop

in both the female unemployment rate from 7.6

to 7.0 per cent and the male unemployment rate

from 3.0 per cent to 2.9 per cent, during the period

under review, contributed to the overall decrease

in the unemployment rate.

During 2016, unemployment rates by

the level of education declined across all

categories. The unemployment rate among the

GCE (A/L) and above, GCE (O/L) and grade 6-10

education level categories declined to 8.3 per

cent, 5.9 per cent and 3.3 per cent, respectively,

in 2016 compared to 9.2 per cent, 6.4 per cent and

3.4 percent, respectively, in 2015. The highest rate

of unemployment is observed in the GCE (A/L)

and above category, which indicates the need for

measures aimed at human capital development, to

meet labour market demands in the economy.

Unemployment rates of all age groups

declined during 2016 except for the

unemployment rate among youth (15-24 years).

Unemployment rate among youth has reached 21.6

per cent in 2016, compared to 20.8 per cent in 2015.

Difficulty for the youth to find suitable employment

in line with their capacity will force them to a state

of underemployment6, thereby making it difficult for

them to overcome poverty and contribute to the

overall development of the economy.

The Youth Not in Employment, Education or

Training (NEET) is a newly introduced indicator

for Sri Lanka by the DCS in its Labour Force

Survey Annual Report 2015. Accordingly, one

out of every four youth belongs to the NEET

category, which indicates the youth inactivity and

vulnerability. For the year 2015, as published by

the DCS, the NEET rate stood at 25.8 per cent.

More female NEET rate is more than twice of the

male NEET rate. Young people who are NEET

are at a risk of becoming socially excluded, with

an income below the poverty line and without an

opportunity to improve their skills that would help

them to overcome their economic condition. Unless

appropriate measures are taken, this situation

would become a social and economic burden to

the society in the near future and would also result

in skill deterioration of the future labour force in the

long run.

High unemployment among youth, females

and educationally qualified persons continues

to be a severe concern in the Sri Lankan labour

market. Skills mismatch, lack of access to finance

and lack of targeted training are the main reasons

for such a situation. Although various programmes

are in place to address the skills mismatch such as

vocational training, skills could be further enhanced

with internship and apprenticeship opportunities.

To address the issue of lack of access to finance,

it has been proposed in the Budget 2017 to

encourage banks to lend to identified categories

including women and youth. With regard to lack of

targeted training, certain booming industries such

as construction and hospitality could be targeted,

which are currently suffering from a skilled and

semi-skilled labour shortage. Such training would

improve the employability of domestic workers,

while reducing the need for imported labour.

Attitudes of youth who are searching for public

sector employment or white collar jobs would need

to change in order to cater to the rising labour

demands of different dimensions of an expanding

economy.

Foreign Employment

The total number of departures for foreign

employment declined further in 2016, recording

a 7.8 percent decrease compared to 2015. The

continuous decline in foreign employment is mainly

attributable to the policy actions adopted by the

government to minimise the impact on society due

to housemaid departures, prior departure training

requirements imposed and the lower demand for

migrant labour in destination markets due to the

slowdown in economic activities, particularly in

the Middle East. Accordingly, the total number of

departures for foreign employment was recorded

at 242,930 in 2016, compared to 263,443 in 2015.

The overall decline was due to female departures

declining by 8.9 per cent to 82,628 in 2016, from

90,655 in 2015 and male departures declining by

7.2 per cent to 160,302 in 2016, from 172,788 in

2015.

The profile of departures for foreign

employment has shifted from housemaid

centered departures through licensed agents

to male centered departures through private

sources over the past ten years. Skill wise

departures for foreign employment reveal that both

Professional and Middle Level manpower categories

have increased by 12.2 per cent, while departures in

all other skill categories recorded a decline in 2016.

Although a shift in the skill levels of migrant labour

can be observed over the years, with the steps

taken as per the strategic direction of the authorities

towards “Safe, Skilled Migration” since 2008, the

unskilled and housemaid categories still account for

56 per cent of total departures. Only 2.7 per cent

of worker departures were under the Professional

category in 2016, recording a marginal improvement

from 2.4 per cent recorded in 2015. Furthermore, a

notable increase in departures to South Korea was

also observed, yet 97 per cent of departures were

unskilled workers. These developments reflect the

scope for continued efforts towards encouraging

safe and skilled migration in the future with a

rationalised and a balanced increase in skilled

categories along with the decline in housemaid and

unskilled categories, thus compensating for the

possible reductions in remittances.

A circular was issued by the Sri Lanka

Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) as per

2017 Budget Proposals, setting the minimum

wage of unskilled workers to US dollars 350

and skilled workers to US dollars 450, excluding

any allowances, with effect from 01 February

2017. This followed the SLBFE announcement

of increasing the minimum wage of skilled and

unskilled workers up to US dollars 300 with effect

from 23 March 2016. The new circular was issued

with an objective of encouraging skilled labour

migration and strengthening the welfare of migrant

employees. However, a minimum wage regulation

will raise the cost of Sri Lankan migrant labour,

thereby affecting the competitiveness of Sri Lankan

migrant employees in the international labour

market. Worker remittances is one of the largest

sources of foreign exchange earnings in the country

and any setback in the remittance flow would

adversely affect the external current account.

The SLBFE initiated several programmes

to regulate the labour migration process and

to ensure the dignity, security and equity of

Sri Lankan migrant workers. The Web-based

Recruitment System, which was initiated with

the objective of improving the efficiency of the

recruitment process, was further strengthened by

extending its coverage to more countries. In order

to ensure trustworthy foreign employment for Sri

Lankan migrant workers, the SLBFE conducted

201 raids on illegal recruitment activities during

the year 2016, which is an increase of 81 per cent

compared to 2015. Further, to combat human

trafficking on a priority basis, the SLBFE has also

set up the “Counter Human Trafficking Unit” in

2016.

Labour Relations and Labour Market Reforms

The total number of workers involved in strikes

and man days lost due to strikes increased in

2016, amidst a decline in the total number of

strikes reported, indicating deteriorating labour

relations. The total number of workers involved

in strikes increased by 38.5 per cent to 20,652 in

2016, driven mainly by employees of sectors other

than plantation. The total number of man days lost

due to strikes increased by 21 per cent to 85,637 in

the plantation sector and by 61 per cent to 18,690

in sectors other than plantation. The labour issues

prevailing in the plantation sector further aggravates

the contraction observed in the sector that is led by

low productivity. Adverse weather conditions and cost

escalation would adversely affect the operations of

the plantation industry.

Ministry of Labour and Trade Union

Relations adopted several measures in 2016 to

improve workplace cooperation and industrial

harmony, with the view of establishing a better

working environment in the private sector.

Awareness programmes and workshops were

conducted, targeting the managers, key staff

members and employees of selected enterprises

in the private sector, for promoting social dialog

to develop and strengthen industrial harmony at

workplaces. Meanwhile, a collective agreement

in the plantation sector was signed, increasing

the minimum wage of the plantation workers up to

Rs. 730. The Ministry has ratified two conventions

of the International Labour Organisation during

2016. The first convention is to design an active

employment policy, to promote fully productive

and freely chosen employment and to address

the issues in the fields of youth employment,

skills development and local empowerment

through economic development, to strengthen

labour inspection, child labour and migration in

Sri Lanka. The aims of the second are to promote

employment of Sri Lankan seafarers and to

obtain other benefits of the merchant shipping

industry in terms of wellbeing, health and

safety of the workers and growth of the sector.

Furthermore, permission was granted for private

sector industries to extend the administrative

relaxation to spread over the working hours on

five days of the week for one year, commencing

from January 2016.

Labour Productivity

Labour productivity, as measured by

Gross Value Added (GVA) (in 2010 prices) per

hour worked, increased marginally by 0.2 per

cent to Rs. 463.20 per hour in the first three

quarters of 2016 from Rs. 462.09 per hour in

the same period of 2015. The level of labour

productivity in the Agriculture sector continues

to remain the lowest of all three sectors in the

economy, with Rs. 173.70 per hour worked

compared to Rs. 503.27 and Rs. 561.41 in the

Industry and Services sectors, respectively, for

the first three quarters of 2016. The Agriculture

sector contributes to a share of around 7 per cent

of the national output, while approximately 27 per

cent of workers in the country are employed in

the sector. Many factors contribute to the low

productivity in the Agriculture sector, such as

traditional methods of cultivation, lack of credit

facilities and access to technology, small size

of lands and adverse weather conditions. To

improve the productivity in the Agriculture sector,

a key driver could be the adoption of technology

in commercial agricultural activities and the use

of high yielding varieties and hybrid seeds. Such

actions towards increasing the productivity levels

would add value along the agricultural value

chain in Sri Lanka and uplift the living standards

of the people who are dependent on the sector,

while contributing to overall economic prosperity.

The Industry and Services sectors have the

potential to further improve productivity and

facilitate overall economic growth. Measures

could be implemented to improve the productivity

levels of the employed population while taking

proactive measures to reap unearthed potential

of the unemployed. Youth and educationally

qualified persons tend to seek employment

particularly in the Industry and Services sectors.

However, with the skills mismatch between the

supply and demand in the domestic labour market,

there is a shortage of required labour in order

for these sectors to expand. The unemployed

population could be utilised effectively through

proper skill alignment programmes. Improving

the productivity of the already employed

population, through continuous development

programmes, is also important to sustain the

productivity progression. Such actions would

help retain the competitive edge of the Industry

and Services sectors in the future. It would

also address productivity concerns that could

emanate from elderly persons participating in

the work force. Further, the continuous adoption

of latest technological advancements could

enhance the productivity of these two sectors.

However, the adoption of technology would

have to be enterprise wide and holistic, where

every employee and all systems and processes

are aligned with the technological adoption, to

successfully fulfill the strategic direction of the

firm. Workers would have to change their skill

levels due to the changing labour demands and

also due to the obsolescence of certain jobs with

the rapid technological change, partly in line with

the structural change in employment patterns of

the country.
