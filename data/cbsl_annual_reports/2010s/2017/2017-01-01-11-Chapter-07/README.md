7.1 OverviewT

he conduct of monetary policy in 2016 was aimed at supporting the addressing of the existing and emerging imbalances

in the Sri Lankan economy. The Central Bank

tightened its monetary policy stance during 2016

to restrain excessive growth of monetary and

credit aggregates to contain the possible buildup

of demand driven inflationary pressures in the

economy. The Central Bank raised the Statutory

Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all rupee

deposit liabilities of licensed commercial banks

(LCBs) by 1.50 percentage points to 7.50 per cent

effective January 2016, to permanently absorb

a part of excess liquidity in the domestic money

market. Furthermore, in view of rising inflationary

pressures, the Central Bank increased its key

policy interest rates, namely the Standing Deposit

Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending

Facility Rate (SLFR), by 50 basis points in February

2016. Despite policy measures taken preemptively,

headline inflation indicated an upward movement,

particularly in mid 2016 mainly due to supply side

disturbances and changes to the government tax

structure, while core inflation also increased. With

credit to the private sector growing unabated amidst

the rising trend in inflation, the Central Bank further

tightened its monetary policy stance by increasing

the SDFR and the SLFR by another 50 basis points

in July 2016 to 7.00 per cent and 8.50 per cent,

respectively. Alongside the restrictive monetary

policy measures, open market operations (OMO)

guided overnight interest rates towards the upper

bound of the policy rate corridor. The continuation of

the macroprudential measures adopted in late 2015

as well as the gradual adjustment in the exchange

rate also complemented the monetary policy

actions of the Central Bank. Although both headline

and core inflation indicated some stabilisation

during the second half of the year, the reimposition

of revisions to the government tax structure along

with further supply side disruptions, largely due to

the drought caused inflation to increase somewhat

towards the end of the year. Despite this upward

movement, inflation remained broadly within the

expected levels of the Central Bank and the target

bands agreed with the International Monetary Fund

(IMF) under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF)

Programme. The upward adjustment of short

term interest rates following monetary tightening

measures permeated to market interest rates.

Reflecting the impact of monetary tightening amidst

fiscal tightening measures and the base effect of

the high growth in the previous year, the expansion

of private sector credit decelerated to 21.9

per cent by end 2016 from its peak of 28.5

per cent in July 2016, although this deceleration

was somewhat below expectations. Continued

expansion in net credit to the government (NCG)

and robust growth in private sector credit amidst

a contraction in credit to public corporations, led

broad money (M2b) to grow by 18.1 per cent, on

average, in 2016. With a view to containing the

buildup of adverse inflation expectations and the

possible acceleration of demand side inflationary

pressures through continued monetary and credit

expansion above the desired levels, the Central

Bank further tightened the monetary policy stance

by raising policy interest rates by 25 basis points

in March 2017. The gradual transition from the

current enhanced monetary policy framework

towards flexible inflation targeting (FIT), which

relies on managing inflation expectations through

forward looking decision making as the key anchor

of monetary policy in the context of increased

flexibility of the exchange rate, is expected to

enable maintaining price stability on a sustainable

basis and the achievement of macroeconomic

stability in the medium term.

7.2 Monetary Policy Stance of the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Stabilising inflation at mid single digits

over the medium term, without compromising

growth prospects of the economy, remained the

primary focus of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in

the conduct of monetary policy. Accordingly, the

Central Bank conducted monetary policy within an

enhanced monetary policy framework with features

of both monetary targeting and inflation targeting.

Market based policy instruments, particularly policy

interest rates and OMO were used as the key policy

tools to steer the Average Weighted Call Money

Rate (AWCMR), the operating target of the current

enhanced monetary policy framework along the

desired path, while broad money (M2b) continued

to serve as the key indicative intermediate variable

reflecting both liquidity and credit conditions in

the economy. A comprehensive and systematic

economic and monetary analyses, including short to

medium term forecasts and expectations surveys,

formed the basis of the monetary policy decision

making process. Careful assessments of risks to

future inflation were regularly conducted and the

outcomes were informed through the Monetary

Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank to the

Monetary Board to decide on appropriate policy

measures to ensure the realisation of the envisaged

monetary policy objectives.

Headline inflation, which was on an upward

trend during the first half of 2016, stabilised

somewhat in the second half of the year.

National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100)

based year-on-year headline inflation followed an

increasing trend, but remained below mid single

digits during the first four months of 2016. However,

due to the combined impact of disruptions to

domestic supplies on account of adverse weather

conditions, increase in the rate of the Value Added

Tax (VAT) and the removal of several exemptions

pertinent to VAT and the Nation Building Tax

(NBT), inflation accelerated in May-June 2016. The

subsequent suspension of the implementation of

changes to the government tax structure and the

recovery in domestic supply conditions caused

some deceleration in inflation during the third

quarter of 2016. The reimposition of revisions to

VAT and NBT in November 2016 exerted some

upward pressure on prices, although year-on-year

inflation remained broadly stable. Accordingly,

year-on-year headline inflation based on the

NCPI, which peaked at 6.4 per cent in June 2016,

gradually receded to 4.2 per cent by end 2016,

thus registering the same rate as at end 2015.

On an annual average basis, however, NCPI

based headline inflation accelerated to 4.0 per

cent by end 2016 compared to 3.8 per cent at

end 2015. Year-on-year headline inflation based

on the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI,

2013=100), peaked at 5.8 per cent in July 2016,

before registering 4.5 per cent at end 2016. On

an annual average basis, CCPI based headline

inflation accelerated to 4.0 per cent by end 2016,

compared to 2.2 per cent at end 2015. As per

the Inflation Expectations Survey of the Central

Bank, inflation expectations of the corporate

sector remained subdued, although those of the

household sector showed some increase.

Core inflation, which is typically considered

a measure of the demand driven component

of inflation, broadly followed an upward trend

in 2016, albeit a decline was observed during

some months. Although demand pressures

underpinned by the expansion in monetary and

credit aggregates would have been reflected in

the movements of core inflation to a certain extent,

upward revisions made to the tax structure by

the government was the main contributory factor

for the increase in core inflation by mid 2016.

Foreseeing the upward pressure on inflation, the

Central Bank tightened its stance on monetary

policy in early January and mid February 2016,

which helped contain inflation somewhat, although

the upward revision of VAT with effect from May

2016 posed a direct threat on keeping inflation at

mid single digits. However, further measures to

tighten monetary policy in July 2016 alongside the

suspension of revisions related to VAT and NBT,

helped stabilise core inflation from August through

October 2016. Nevertheless, the reimposition of

revisions to VAT and NBT caused core inflation

to increase somewhat during November and

December 2016. Accordingly, NCPI based core

inflation, which peaked at 7.5 per cent, on a year-

on-year basis, in June 2016, slowed somewhat to

6.7 per cent by end 2016, but remained above the

level of 5.8 per cent recorded at end 2015. On an

annual average basis, NCPI based core inflation

also accelerated to 5.9 per cent by end 2016 from

4.6 per cent at end 2015. However, year-on-year

core inflation based on the CCPI decelerated from

6.7 per cent at end 2015 to 5.8 per cent by end

2016, while on an annual average basis, it slowed

to 4.4 per cent by end 2016 from 4.9 per cent at

end 2015.

In the meantime, M2b expanded above the

desired level during 2016 on account of the

substantial expansion in credit to both the

private sector and the government. Year-on-year

growth of M2b remained elevated at 18.4 per cent

by end 2016, compared to the growth of 17.8 per

cent observed at end 2015. The average growth of

broad money also remained high at 18.1 per cent in

2016 in comparison to 15.2 per cent in 2015.

The Central Bank, with a view to curtailing

the possible buildup of demand pressures on

inflation arising from high monetary and credit

expansion and high levels of liquidity in the

domestic money market, adopted several policy

measures. The notable expansion in domestic

credit during 2015, which led to higher than

expected expansion in money supply, warranted

stern action by the Central Bank to preempt its likely

impact on both price stability as well as financial

system stability. Accordingly, the Central Bank

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

7

224

introduced a number of prudential measures towards

end 2015, such as the imposition of a minimum

cash margin requirement on Letters of Credit (LCs)

opened for the importation of motor vehicles, which

was later replaced by the imposition of a maximum

Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio on motor vehicle purchases

during the last quarter of 2015, while also allowing

greater flexibility in the determination of the exchange

rate. The monetary policy stance of the Central Bank

was also tightened substantially. Accordingly, the

SRR applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of LCBs

was raised by 1.50 percentage points to 7.50 per cent,

to be effective from the reserve period commencing

16 January 2016. This measure permanently

absorbed around Rs. 52 billion of excess liquidity

from the domestic money market, while short term

money market rates were allowed to adjust upwards

in response. The Central Bank also raised its policy

interest rates, namely the SDFR and the SLFR, by 50

basis points each, to 6.50 per cent and 8.00 per cent,

respectively, effective from the close of business

on 19 February 2016 with a view to reining in the

growth of monetary and credit aggregates. Although

market interest rates adjusted upwards reflecting the

pass-through effect of monetary policy measures,

credit flows to the private sector by commercial

banks grew persistently at higher than projected

levels due to increased ease of obtaining credit as

well as increased demand for long term credit from

all major sectors of the economy as reflected in the

Quarterly Survey of Commercial Banks’ Loans and

Advances to the Private Sector. Considering these

developments, the Central Bank further tightened its

monetary policy stance by raising the SDFR and the

SLFR by 50 basis points each to 7.00 per cent and

8.50 per cent, respectively, effective from the close of

business on 28 July 2016. With the view of bringing

down monetary expansion to desired levels while

curtailing the buildup of adverse inflation expectations,

the Central Bank raised the policy interest rates again

by 25 basis points effective 24 March 2017.

OMO of the Central Bank was aimed at

managing rupee liquidity in the domestic

money market in order to maintain the

overnight interest rates at desired levels.

Rupee liquidity in the domestic money market,

which declined with the increase in SRR in early

2016, declined further in the second quarter of the

year. Regular reverse repurchase auctions were

conducted by the Central Bank from the second

quarter onwards to provide short term liquidity to

market participants, while standing facilities were

also made available. With rupee liquidity turning

towards a surplus in certain times during the year,

the Central Bank also conducted repurchase

auctions appropriately to absorb liquidity on

an overnight basis. Restrictive monetary policy

measures, broadly tighter liquidity conditions and

the resultant upward adjustment in short term

market interest rates transmitted to deposit and

lending rates of financial institutions, causing the

economy’s cost of funds to increase, which was

crucial to restrict the excessive demand for credit

from the private sector.

The Central Bank continued to enhance

its communication policy effectively to keep

all stakeholders of the economy informed of

its monetary policy decisions with greater

transparency and clarity. Policies and decisions

of the Central Bank were communicated to the

general public and market participants in a timely

manner along with the rationale for such policy

measures through regular communiqués, press

conferences, meetings, seminars, lectures and

speeches by the Governor and other key officials

of the Central Bank, with the view of managing

expectations. Moreover, key publications of the

Central Bank, such as the Annual Report and

the Recent Economic Developments, provided

detailed analyses of macroeconomic data, while

information on key macroeconomic indicators

were disseminated and made available on

daily, weekly and monthly bases through the

Central Bank website in all three languages.

The Macroeconomic Chart Pack continued to

be featured on the Central Bank website, while

the announcement of the Annual Road Map for

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies to guide

stakeholders of the economy with a medium term

focus was recommenced in January 2017. In

the "Road Map 2017", the Central Bank formally

announced the intention to move to the FIT over

the medium term. The number of MPC meetings

were reduced to eight per annum to provide

adequate time to conduct extensive analyses on

the developments and projections of economic

variables.

7.3 Movements of Interest Rates

Market Liquidity, Market Operations and Short Term Interest Rates

Rupee liquidity in the money market, which

was in surplus during the ﬁrst quarter of 2016,

turned to a deficit thereafter, before increasing

towards end 2016. The money market operated

with a high level of excess liquidity of Rs. 105.3

billion at end 2015. Considering the ramifications

of persistent and high liquidity levels in the market,

the Central Bank increased SRR applicable on all

rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks by

1.50 percentage points to 7.50 per cent with effect

from 16 January 2016. This absorbed liquidity from

the domestic money market of around Rs. 52 billion

permanently. Reflecting the decline in liquidity

levels, short term interest rates commenced

adjusting upwards. Nonetheless, rupee liquidity in

the domestic money market remained notably high

averaging around Rs. 84 billion during the first two

months of 2016 due to maturing of term repurchase

agreements, purchase of Treasury bills by the

Central Bank and providing provisional advances

to the government. However, excess liquidity in the

domestic money market declined gradually to an

average of around Rs. 9 billion in March 2016 as a

result of new term repurchase agreements, foreign

loan repayments and supply of foreign exchange

to the domestic foreign exchange market by the

Central Bank. Nevertheless, the impact of foreign

exchange swap arrangements of commercial

banks with the Central Bank moderated the

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

7

226

decline in market liquidity levels to a certain extent.

Consequently, the liquidity deficit in the domestic

money market during April-June averaged

at around Rs. 9 billion. However, occasional

purchases of Treasury bills in the primary market

by the Central Bank led to sporadic increases in

liquidity levels. This was a result of the Central

Bank intervening in the government securities

market to dampen speculative increases in yield

rates within the purely auction based system in

issuing government securities, which may also

have impacted the monetary policy transmission to

some extent. Nevertheless, liquidity in the domestic

money market continued to be in deficit levels

during June-October 2016 averaging at around Rs.

27 billion due to the impact of maturing Treasury

bills held by the Central Bank as well as foreign loan

repayments. Due to the deficit in market liquidity

that prevailed, auctions for outright purchases of

Treasury bills were conducted to inject liquidity into

the market on a permanent basis from the latter

part of November 2016. Meanwhile, occasional

purchases of Treasury bills by the Central Bank

were observed in the primary market during the

month of December, which also added liquidity to

the money market. Accordingly, overnight liquidity

in the domestic money market at end 2016 was a

surplus of Rs. 39.2 billion.

Responding to monetary tightening

measures of the Central Bank and deficit

liquidity conditions in the domestic money

market, interbank call money market rates

adjusted upwards during 2016. With the Central

Bank’s decision to raise SRR with effect from

January 2016 and to increase policy interest rates

in February 2016, AWCMR increased to 7.50

per cent by end February 2016 compared to 6.40

per cent reported at end 2015. Responding to the

decline in market liquidity levels by end March

2016, AWCMR increased further and moved

beyond the upper bound of the policy rate corridor

reaching 8.15 per cent by the first week of April

2016. With the support of OMO conducted by the

Central Bank to stabilise interest rates, AWCMR

hovered in a range of 8.15-8.24 per cent thereafter

until July 2016. Following the increase in policy

interest rates for the second time in July 2016,

AWCMR increased and stabilised at around 8.40

per cent thereafter. By end 2016, AWCMR was at

8.42 per cent, recording an increase of 202 basis

points during the year. With the increase in money

market liquidity during January 2017, AWCMR

adjusted downwards somewhat in January 2017,

but increased towards end March 2017 with

the upward adjustment in policy interest rates.

Accordingly, by end March 2017, AWCMR was

recorded at 8.75 per cent. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka

Inter Bank Offered Rates (SLIBOR) also moved

upwards during the year. Accordingly, by end 2016,

overnight and 12-month SLIBOR stood at 8.44 per

cent and 12.00 per cent, respectively, compared to

6.40 per cent and 7.66 per cent, respectively, at end

2015. Moreover, the weighted average yields at the

daily OMO auctions adjusted upwards gradually

during 2016 responding to the movements in

policy interest rates and market liquidity levels.

The Central Bank conducted overnight reverse

repurchase auctions on most of the days in 2016,

with the view of injecting liquidity into the domestic

money market, and thereby stabilising money

market rates. The weighted average yields at the

OMO reverse repurchase auctions increased to

8.50 per cent by end November 2016 from 6.61 per

cent recorded in mid January 2016.

Yields on Government Securities

Yields on government securities showed

an upward trend during 2016 despite some

moderation observed in the second half of the

year. Reflecting the increased demand for funds

by the government, delays in foreign financial

inflows to the government as well as the impact of

monetary tightening, yields in the primary Treasury

bill market showed an increasing trend, especially

during the first quarter of 2016. Accordingly, the

weighted average yields on Treasury bills on 91-

day, 182-day and 364-day increased by 245 basis

points, 293 basis points and 334 basis points,

respectively, to 8.90 per cent, 9.76 per cent and

10.64 per cent, respectively, by the end of March

2016 compared to end 2015. Meanwhile, the

government’s fiscal consolidation programme and

the announcement of the EFF Programme of the

IMF resulted in favourable market expectations

in the government securities market. The upward

pressure on yields of government securities began

to moderate from April 2016 due to foreign inflows

to the government securities market. Despite some

upward movements of the yields of Treasury bills

during April-July, yields in the primary market

remained broadly stable during this period.

Meanwhile, the receipt of long term financial flows

from the successful issuance of Sri Lanka’s tenth

International Sovereign Bond (ISB) amounting

to US dollars 1.5 billion in July 2016 as well as

proceeds from the syndicated loans totalling US

dollars 700 million helped minimise the pressure on

yields of government securities. The policy rate hike

in July 2016 led to an upward adjustment in yields

again. Nevertheless, improvements in government

finances and the availability of foreign inflows

resulted in yields on Treasury bill rates declining from

end August 2016, although a marginal increase in

yields was observed during December. With these

developments, the primary market yields on 91-day,

182-day and 364-day Treasury bills declined by 18

basis points, 13 basis points and 47 basis points,

respectively, to 8.72 per cent, 9.63 per cent and 10.17

per cent, respectively, by the end of the year from the

levels observed at end March 2016.

Yield rates pertaining to government

securities with longer maturities displayed an

increasing trend in 2016. Similar to the yields

on Treasury bills in the primary market, yields

on Treasury bonds also increased sharply during

the first quarter of 2016 due to the high borrowing

requirement of the government. The government

relied more on short and medium term Treasury

bonds and also issued short to medium term

Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) during

the period. The primary market yield on 4-year

Treasury bonds increased from 8.91 per cent at

end 2015 to 11.94 per cent by end 2016. Similar

movements were observed in yields pertaining to

Treasury bonds of other maturities as well. Yields

on 5-year Treasury bonds increased from 9.79 per

cent at end 2015 to a peak of 13.00 per cent by

early April, before moderating to 11.76 per cent at

end 2016, showing an increase of 197 basis points

during the year. The average weighted yield on

10-year Treasury bonds also increased by 117

basis points, from 10.94 per cent at end 2015 to

12.11 per cent by end 2016. Treasury bonds with

longer maturities of 14 and 25 years were also

issued during the first half of 2016.

In line with the movements in primary market

yields, the secondary market yield curve on

government securities shifted upwards during

2016. Secondary market yields on Treasury bills

pertaining to all three maturities increased by 230-

306 basis points in 2016. The secondary market

yields on Treasury bonds with maturities of 2-30

years, which were in a range of 7.65 - 11.34 per

cent by end 2015, also increased to a range of

11.38 - 13.27 per cent by end 2016. This upward

shift in the rate structure can be partly attributed

to the contractionary monetary policy stance and

the continued high borrowing requirement of the

government.

Deposit and Lending Interest Rates

Interest rates offered on deposits of

commercial banks continued to increase during

2016, reflecting the transmission of the effect

of tight monetary conditions to retail interest

rates. Upward movement in deposit rates during

2016 also reflected the increased funding costs

of financial institutions. Accordingly, the Average

Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR), which reflects

the movements in interest rates pertaining to all

outstanding interest bearing deposits held with

commercial banks, increased by 197 basis points

to 8.17 per cent by end 2016 from 6.20 per cent at

end 2015. Meanwhile, the Average Weighted Fixed

Deposit Rate (AWFDR), which is based on interest

rates pertaining to all outstanding time deposits

held with commercial banks, also increased by 289

basis points to 10.46 per cent by end 2016 from

7.57 per cent at end 2015. A substantial increase in

interest rates pertaining to short term time deposits,

particularly for 3-months and 1-year, was observed

during the year. The increase in deposit rates and

increased efforts of banks to mobilise deposits

from the general public aggressively also resulted

in a substantial increase in the deposit base during

2016. Accordingly, the Average Weighted New

Deposit Rate (AWNDR), which captures interest

rates pertaining to all new interest bearing deposits

placed with commercial banks during a month,

increased by 421 basis points to 11.17 per cent

by end December 2016 from 6.96 per cent at end

December 2015. The Average Weighted New

Fixed Deposit Rate (AWNFDR), which is based on

interest rates pertaining to all new time deposits

held with commercial banks during a month also

increased by 431 basis points to 11.44 per cent by

end December 2016 from 7.13 per cent recorded

at end 2015. Despite some increase in inflation,

depositors continued to benefit from positive real

rates of return on their savings during 2016.

The Legal rate and the Market rate of

interest,1 as determined by the Monetary Board

and published in the Government Gazette at the

end of each year, were 7.06 per cent per annum

for 2017 compared to 5.98 per cent per annum

for 2016. These rates were computed in December

2016 based on simple averages of monthly AWDR

of all commercial banks during the preceding

twelve months.

Lending rates of commercial banks

increased during 2016, reflecting the impact

of the tight monetary stance, deficit liquidity

conditions and increased cost of funds due

to high deposit interest rates offered in view

of aggressive deposit mobilisation. Reflecting

1 The Legal rate is defined under the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 6 of 1990 and is applicable to any action for the recovery of a sum of money. The Market rate is defined under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990 and applies only in relation to actions instituted by lending institutions for the recovery of debt exceeding Rs. 150,000 arising out of commercial transactions, where there is no agreed rate of interest.

the upward movement in short term lending

rates during 2016, the weekly Average Weighted

Prime Lending Rate (AWPR), which is computed

based on interest rates applicable on loans and

advances granted by commercial banks to their

prime customers every week, increased by 399

basis points to 11.52 per cent by end 2016 from

7.53 per cent at end 2015, while the monthly

AWPR increased by 433 basis points to 11.73

during 2016, although a marginal reversal in the

increasing trend was observed during the last

quarter of the year. Meanwhile, bankwise average

weighted lending rates increased to a range of

10.12-15.66 per cent by end 2016 compared

to the range of 7.82 - 13.35 per cent recorded

at end 2015. The increase in lending rates was

observed across all underlying securities during

2016. In particular, while interest rates based

on different securities increased at different

magnitudes, interest rates on loans and advances

secured by shares, bonds, debentures, sundries,

including life insurance policies; gold and other

precious metals under pawning; fixed, savings

and other deposits; and immovable property,

plant and machinery increased considerably.

Further, the Average Weighted New Lending Rate

(AWNLR), which captures interest rates of all new

loans and advances extended by commercial

banks to the private sector during a month,

increased substantially by 358 basis points to

14.37 per cent by end December 2016 from 10.79

per cent reported at end December 2015.

Interest Rates on Debt Instruments

Interest rates on corporate debt securities

moved up in line with other market interest

rates. Accordingly, interest rates pertaining to

commercial paper, which is an avenue for short-

term borrowing by large corporates, increased

to a range of 8.70 - 14.80 per cent during 2016

compared to 7.00 - 12.00 per cent in 2015. There

were 18 new listings of corporate debentures in

2016 with multiple maturities from 2 to 10 years.

Most of these debentures were issued with fixed

interest rates, while a few of them were issued

on the basis of floating rates. Fixed interest rates

applicable on debentures were in the range of

9.60 - 13.75 per cent in 2016 compared to

7.60 - 12.00 per cent reported in 2015.

Interest Rates on Foreign Currency Deposits

Interest rates applicable on foreign

currency denominated deposits maintained

at commercial banks increased marginally

during 2016, responding to the movements

in global interest rates. The increase in the

Federal Funds target rate by the US Federal

Reserve at end 2015 as well as at end 2016

drove the foreign currency deposit rates in Sri

Lanka upwards. Further, relaxation of controls

on withdrawals from foreign currency deposits

and allowing retail investors to invest in SLDBs

may have induced commercial banks to increase

interest rates on foreign currency deposits

to some extent during the year. Accordingly,

interest rates on US dollar denominated savings

deposits increased to a range of 0.02 - 3.62

per cent by end 2016 compared to the range

of 0.02 - 3.00 per cent recorded at end 2015.

Interest rates pertaining to US dollar denominated

time deposits increased to a range of 0.15 - 5.00

per cent by end 2016 compared to the range

of 0.14 - 4.25 per cent recorded at end 2015.

Meanwhile, interest rates on savings deposits

denominated in pound sterling were in the range

7.4 Movements of Monetary and

Credit Aggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money, also known as the

monetary base of the economy, continued to

expand at a high rate during 2016, and this

was reflected in the significant expansion in

commercial banks’ deposits maintained at the

Central Bank, while currency in circulation

also increased in 2016. Accordingly, reserve

money expansion, which was at 16.5 per cent, on

a year-on-year basis, at end 2015, accelerated

further to 27.1 per cent by end 2016. In absolute

terms, reserve money increased noticeably

by Rs. 182.7 billion to Rs. 856.1 billion by end

2016. Commercial banks’ deposits increased

significantly by Rs. 121.5 billion to Rs. 303.3

billion by end 2016, as a result of the upward

adjustment in SRR applicable on all rupee

deposit liabilities of LCBs from the beginning of

2016. Meanwhile, the expansion in currency in

circulation was somewhat slow during the year

as it increased by only Rs. 61.1 billion in 2016,

compared to the increase of Rs. 74.8 billion in

2015, reflecting the increased opportunity cost of

holding money with the upward adjustments in

market interest rates.

Viewed from the assets side of the Central

Bank balance sheet, the expansion in reserve

money was entirely due to the increase in net

domestic assets (NDA) of the Central Bank,

while net foreign assets (NFA) declined during

2016. NDA of the Central Bank increased by

Rs. 200.3 billion in 2016 compared to the

increase of Rs. 207.3 billion in 2015. Within

NDA, NCG by the Central Bank increased by

Rs. 183.1 billion to Rs. 413.0 billion by end 2016 as

a result of the substantial increase in the Central

Bank holdings of government securities (net of

repurchase transactions) by Rs. 250.8 billion

to Rs. 330.0 billion by end 2016 in comparison

to Rs. 79.2 billion at end 2015. During the first

eleven months of 2016, provisional advances

extended to the government by the Central

Bank averaged at around Rs. 184.6 billion in

comparison to Rs. 151.1 billion at end 2015,

but declined by Rs. 101.5 billion in the month

of December 2016 to record Rs. 83.3 billion by

end 2016. This was attributed to the settlement

of a part of provisional advances using funds

raised through the issuance of Treasury bills worth

Rs. 100 billion to the Central Bank during

the month of December 2016. Moreover, a

decline in other liabilities of the Central Bank by

Rs. 18.1 billion led to an increase in other items

(net) within NDA of the Central Bank by Rs. 16.5

billion. This increase was mainly on account of the

contraction observed in funds placed under the

Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) during the year,

resulting from declining levels of domestic money

market liquidity, as well as international reserve

revaluation losses incurred during the year. SDF

placements by commercial banks, which remained

at Rs. 47.7 billion by end February 2016 compared

to Rs. 81.8 billion by end 2015, declined further

to Rs. 24.8 billion on average during the period

of March-November 2016, reflecting the changes

in liquidity levels of the market. However, with

the surplus liquidity observed in December 2016,

SDF placements increased to Rs. 48.7 billion by

end 2016. Moreover, increasing international

reserve revaluation losses was largely as a result

of the depreciation in the rupee during 2016, in the

backdrop of a negative NFA position. Meanwhile,

NFA of the Central Bank declined in 2016 by

Rs. 17.6 billion to Rs. 558.6 billion compared to

Rs. 576.2 billion at end 2015, as a result of the

decline in foreign financial assets in terms of cash

and bank balances abroad during the year. Total

foreign liabilities also recorded a decline in 2016 due

to a decrease in liabilities to foreign central banks/

international organisations including the Reserve

Bank of India (RBI) and the Asian Development

Bank (ADB) along with the reduction in liabilities

under the Stand-By Arrangement Facility (SBA) of

the IMF.

As a result of the significant expansion in

reserve money during the year on account of

the upward adjustment to SRR, the money

multiplier (in relation to M2b) declined to 6.31

by end 2016 from 6.78 recorded at end 2015.

Currency to deposits ratio also declined from 9.3

per cent at end 2015 to 8.6 per cent by end 2016.

On average, the money multiplier decreased to

6.38 in 2016 compared to 6.73 in 2015.

Narrow Money (M1)

Narrow money growth continued to

decelerate during 2016, reflecting the

response of the public to the increase in

the opportunity cost of holding non-interest

bearing monetary assets in the backdrop

of rising market interest rates. The year-on-

year growth of narrow money, which consists of

currency and demand deposits held by the public

with commercial banks, slowed to 8.6 per cent by

end 2016 compared to 16.8 per cent recorded at

end 2015. The rapid slowdown in narrow money

growth was observed in the second half of the

year, as it grew by only 9.6 per cent, on average,

in comparison to the average growth of 14.2 per

cent during the first half of 2016, partly reflecting

the effect of the high base as well as the upward

adjustment in market interest rates. Currency held

by the public increased by 10.7 per cent, year-on-

year, to Rs. 429.5 billion by end 2016 compared

to 17.8 per cent in the previous year, contributing

around 67 per cent to the total expansion in narrow

money supply in 2016. The slowdown in the

expansion of currency in circulation was a result of

rising interest rates. Meanwhile, demand deposits

held by the public with commercial banks at end

2016 increased by 6.2 per cent, on a year-on-

year basis, compared to 15.6 per cent recorded

at end 2015. In absolute terms, demand deposits

amounted to Rs. 347.1 billion at end 2016

compared to Rs. 326.9 billion at end 2015. High

interest rates offered on interest bearing deposits

are likely to have impacted on the moderate

expansion of demand deposits.

Broad Money (M2b) and Domestic Credit

Broad money supply (M2b) continued to grow

at a high rate in 2016 mainly as a result of the

expansion in credit to both the government

and the private sector. The year-on-year growth

of broad money, which peaked at 19.8 per cent in

February 2016, decelerated to 18.4 per cent by end

2016, compared to 17.8 per cent at end 2015. On

average, broad money growth was 18.1 per cent in

2016 in comparison to 15.2 per cent in 2015. The

expansion in M2b during 2016 was largely driven

by the expansion in NDA of the banking system

(which contributed 92 per cent to the expansion in

broad money), while NFA of the banking system also

increased during the year.

On the liability side of M2b, the increase in

time and savings deposits held by the public

with commercial banks largely contributed to

the monetary expansion during 2016. Reflecting

the impact of the upward adjustment in interest

rates offered on interest bearing deposits and

competitive marketing campaigns by commercial

banks to raise funds, the contribution of time

and savings deposits to the overall year-on-year

expansion in broad money increased to about 93

per cent in 2016 compared to 85 per cent recorded

in 2015. Accordingly, time and savings deposits

held by the public with commercial banks increased

by 20.2 per cent, year-on-year, to Rs. 778.0 billion

in 2016, compared to the increase of Rs. 587.2

billion in 2015. Meanwhile, demand deposits held

by the public with commercial banks expanded at a

lower rate of 6.2 per cent, year-on-year, in 2016 in

comparison to 15.6 per cent in 2015.

With regard to the assets side of M2b, NFA

of the banking system recorded an increase

during 2016, reversing the trend observed in

the previous year, led entirely by the expansion

in NFA of commercial banks. NFA of the banking

system continued to contract during the first half of

2016 with a cumulative decline of Rs. 193.8 billion.

However, this trend reversed during the second half of

2016, mainly on account of the improvement in NFA

of commercial banks. Consequently, overall NFA

of the banking system expanded by Rs. 66.9 billion

in 2016 compared to the significant contraction of

Rs. 313.3 billion recorded in 2015. Nevertheless, NFA

of the Central Bank contracted by Rs. 17.6 billion in

2016 following the significant decline of Rs. 111.8

billion in 2015. This was mainly due to the supply of

foreign exchange by the Central Bank to the domestic

foreign exchange market in the backdrop of capital

outflows in the economy leading to a deterioration in

foreign reserves of the Central Bank. The decline in

foreign assets of the Central Bank was reflected in the

contraction of cash and bank balances abroad, while

the Special Drawing Right (SDR) quota increased

during the year with the increase of the country quota

under the general quota review of the IMF with effect

from 17 February 2016. Nevertheless, with the decline

in liabilities to foreign central banks/international

organisations including the RBI and the ADB along

with the reduction in the liabilities under the SBA of

(ACU) increased during the year. Meanwhile, NFA

of commercial banks increased by Rs. 84.5 billion

in 2016 compared to the significant contraction of

Rs. 201.5 billion in 2015 partly attributing to the

reversal of foreign currency swap arrangements

with the Central Bank enabling more investments

abroad successively. Within NFA of commercial

banks, NFA of offshore banking units (OBUs)

increased by Rs. 114.3 billion in 2016, with

increased placements with banks and non-banks

abroad, while borrowings from abroad also declined

considerably during the year. NFA of domestic

banking units (DBUs) contracted by Rs. 29.8 billion

in 2016 mainly due to the combined impact of the

increase in commercial bank borrowings from

abroad and the increase in balances of foreign

currency accounts held with commercial banks by

non-residents, while foreign currency placements

with banks abroad increased during the period

under review.

Driven by the expansion in credit flows to

domestic sectors, NDA of the banking system

expanded further in 2016, albeit at a slower pace

in comparison to 2015. In absolute terms, NDA

recorded an increase of Rs. 772.8 billion in 2016, but

remained below the increase of Rs. 1,003.4 billion

observed in the previous year. The expansion in NDA

of the banking system was mainly driven by increases

in credit extended to both the government and the

private sector by the banking system, while there was

a decline in credit obtained by public corporations in

2016.

Contributing to the increase in NDA, NCG from

the banking system increased substantially

in 2016. During the year, NCG increased by

Rs. 212.6 billion compared to the increase of

Rs. 323.6 billion recorded in 2015. The increase

in NCG was mainly driven by the considerable

increase in credit extended to the government by

the Central Bank, while NCG from commercial

banks also positively contributed to the overall

increase. Accordingly, NCG from the Central

Bank increased by Rs. 183.1 billion in 2016

compared to Rs. 80.3 billion in 2015, mainly due

to the increased purchases of Treasury bills by

the Central Bank in the primary market, amidst the

temporary decline in provisional advances to the

government observed at end 2016. The Treasury

bill holdings (net of repurchase transactions)

of the Central Bank increased significantly

to a historically high level of Rs. 330.0 billion

compared to Rs. 79.2 billion recorded at end

2015. Provisional advances to the government,

which averaged around Rs. 184.6 billion during

the first eleven months of 2016 compared to

Rs. 151.1 billion at end 2015, declined by

Rs. 101.5 billion to Rs. 83.3 billion by end 2016.

This was mainly due to the partial settlement of

provisional advances using funds raised through

the issuance of Treasury bills worth Rs. 100.0

billion to the Central Bank during the month of

December 2016. Meanwhile, NCG by commercial

banks increased only by Rs. 29.6 billion during

2016 compared to the substantial increase of

Rs. 243.3 billion in 2015. Contributing to the

increase in NCG from commercial banks, NCG

by DBUs increased by Rs. 96.6 billion in 2016

compared to the increase of Rs. 79.7 billion in

2015 mainly due to the higher investments in

Treasury bonds (by Rs. 187.1 billion) and SLDBs

(by Rs. 9.3 billion) indicating the commercial banks’

preference towards securities with long term

tenure, while short term loans to the government

also increased by Rs. 10.4 billion during the

period under review. Nevertheless, Treasury bill

holdings (net of repurchase transactions) of DBUs

declined by Rs. 97.5 billion during the year and

outstanding overdraft balances of the government

also declined by Rs. 27.8 billion. Meanwhile, NCG

by OBUs of commercial banks declined by Rs. 67.1

billlion in 2016 compared to the notable increase

of Rs. 163.6 billion recorded in 2015, largely due

to maturities of SLDBs as well as the decline in

new investments in SLDBs, despite the increase

in direct loans to the government by around

Rs. 8.3 billion during the year.

Reflecting the improvements in a number

of state owned business enterprises (SOBEs),

credit extended by the banking system to public

corporations declined during 2016. The declining

trend in credit to public corporations that was

observed since November 2015 continued during

the first eight months of 2016 recording a cumulative

contraction of outstanding credit to public corporations

by around Rs. 81.5 billion by end August 2016. The

improved financial position of key public corporations,

particularly Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC),

contributed to this decline. However, this trend

reversed since September 2016, thus limiting the

overall contraction to Rs. 27.9 billion by end 2016

as against an increase of Rs. 76.9 billion recorded in

2015. With the improved financial position supported

by relatively low oil prices, CPC settled around Rs.

71.9 billion of its outstanding liabilities to commercial

banks in 2016. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and

Sri Lanka Ports Authority also repaid around Rs. 4.9

billion and Rs. 2.3 billion, respectively, during 2016.

Meanwhile, credit obtained by SriLankan Airlines

from the commercial banking sector increased by

Rs. 16.7 billion in 2016, while borrowings of several

other public corporations including Road Development

Authority, Ceylon Fertiliser Corporation, Ceylon

Shipping Corporation and Colombo Commercial

Fertiliser also increased during the period under

review.

Credit extended to the private sector by

commercial banks continued to expand during

2016, although there was a deceleration in

year-on-year growth amidst tight monetary policy

measures and the effect of the high base.2 With

aggressive marketing campaigns by commercial

banks and ample availability of funds as well as

market expectations of upward adjustments in

the government tax structure, credit to the private

sector continued to accelerate during 2016 in spite

of the upward adjustment in market interest rates in

response to monetary tightening measures of the

Central Bank. The acceleration observed in credit to

the private sector in 2015 persisted in 2016 recording

a peak growth of 28.5 per cent, on a year-on-year

basis, by end July 2016. However, the year-on-year

growth of credit to the private sector moderated

towards the latter part of 2016, and recorded a

growth of 21.9 per cent by end 2016, compared to

25.1 per cent at end 2015, reflecting the impact of

tight monetary policy measures and the high base.

In absolute terms, the increase in credit extended to

the private sector was Rs. 754.9 billion during 2016

compared to the increase of Rs. 691.4 billion in the

previous year. As per the Security wise Analysis of

Advances, the cumulative increase in credit against

Immovable Property, Plant and Machinery; Personal

Guarantees and Promissory Notes; and Other

Securities, which include corporate guarantees,

indemnities and staff loans, etc. contributed around

68 per cent to the overall expansion in advances

during the year. Meanwhile, reflecting the impact of

the measures adopted by the government and the

Central Bank to curb excessive demand for motor

vehicles, the expansion in credit against leasing and

hire purchase agreements was substantially lower

during 2016 compared to the previous year.

As per the Quarterly Survey of Commercial

Banks’ Loans and Advances to the Private

Sector, credit disbursed to all major sectors of the

economy expanded considerably in 2016. On a

year-on-year basis, credit flows to the Services and

Industry sectors expanded by 35.4 per cent and

22.2 per cent, respectively, during 2016 compared

to 34.1 per cent and 25.0 per cent, respectively,

subsectors of the Industry sector also expanded

with greater contributions from Construction;

Textiles and Apparel; Fabricated Metal Products,

Machinery and Transport Equipment; Food and

Beverages; Chemical, Petroleum, Pharmaceutical

and Healthcare, and Rubber and Plastic Products.

Among these, credit to the Construction subsector

increased by 26.9 per cent on a year-on-year

basis by end 2016. Credit to the Textiles and

Apparel subsector also increased by 22.7 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2016 as against a contraction

of 12.6 per cent at end 2015. Meanwhile, by end

2016, credit to the Agriculture and Fishing sector

grew by 17.0 per cent, year-on-year, compared to

the growth of 7.5 per cent recorded in 2015. Within

this sector, credit flows directed to the subsectors

of Tea, Rubber, Coconut, Paddy, Vegetable and

Fruit Cultivation and Minor Food Crops and Fisheries

increased considerably during the year. Moreover,

by end 2016, credit in terms of Personal Loans

and Advances increased by 15.2 per cent, year-on-

year, compared to 18.3 per cent recorded at end

2015. Within Personal Loans and Advances, credit

to the subsectors of Consumer Durables, Personal

Healthcare and Personal Education as well as Credit

Card Balances increased during 2016 while Pawning

Advances continued to record a contraction. During

2016, credit towards the purchase of Consumer

Durables increased considerably by 38.1 per cent,

although at a slower pace compared to the growth of

56.0 per cent in 2015. Pawning Advances recorded

a slight contraction of 0.8 per cent, year-on-year, in

2016, compared to the notable contractions of 22.7

per cent in 2015 and 41.0 per cent in 2014. Moreover,

as per the maturity analysis of outstanding credit to

the private sector by commercial banks, short term

credit grew substantially by 19.9 per cent, year-on-

year, by end 2016 compared to 9.4 per cent recorded

at end 2015, while some slowdown was observed in

long term credit as it grew by 29.9 per cent, year-on-

Broad Money (M4)

As per the Financial Survey3, the year-on-year

growth of broad money supply (M4), which is a

broader measure of monetary liabilities, slowed

to 15.9 per cent by end 2016, compared to 16.8

per cent at end 2015. The increase in NDA of the

banking system and licensed finance companies

(LFCs) accounted for 93.3 per cent of the expansion

in M4 as credit disbursements to both the private

sector as well as to the government continued to

increase during 2016.

As per M4, the year-on-year growth of time

and savings deposits, accelerated to 17.1

per cent by end 2016 from the growth of 16.8

per cent observed at end 2015. Time and savings

deposits of LCBs grew by 19.3 per cent, on a

year-on-year basis, by end 2016 in comparison to

a growth of 19.0 per cent recorded at end 2015.

Meanwhile, time and savings deposits of licensed

specialised banks (LSBs) grew by 10.7 per cent,

on a year-on-year basis, by end 2016 from 7.7

per cent at end 2015. The growth of time and

savings deposits of LFCs decelerated, on a year-

per cent at end 2015, possibly as a result of a shift in

deposits towards licensed banks in an environment

of increased deposit rates.

The year-on-year growth of credit to the

private sector in M4 slowed to 20.6 per cent by end

2016 from 23.5 per cent at end 2015. In absolute

terms, the increase in credit extended to the private

sector amounted to Rs. 975.9 billion in 2016 in

comparison to Rs. 900.9 billion in 2015, led mainly by

the increase in credit granted by LCBs. Credit extended

to the private sector by LSBs grew by 16.7 per cent

by end 2016, compared to the tepid growth of 1.5 per

cent at end 2015. In absolute terms, credit extended

by LSBs to the private sector increased by Rs. 80.5

billion in 2016. The increase in credit extended by

LFCs amounted to Rs. 140.5 billion in absolute terms,

compared to Rs. 202.3 billion in 2015. The year-on-

year growth of credit extended to the private sector

by LFCs contracted sharply to 17.4 per cent by end

2016 from 33.6 per cent at end 2015 impacted by

rising market interest rates and prudential measures

introduced, particularly the imposition of a maximum

Loan-to-Value ratio. As per M4, NCG increased by a

total of Rs. 211.6 billion, in absolute terms, with NCG

by LFCs contributing positively to the expansion by

Rs. 12.5 billion during 2016, while NCG by LSBs

declined by Rs. 13.6 billion during the year.

7.5 Future Developments,

Challenges and Outlook

Similar to other countries, Sri Lanka has

also experienced a gradual decline in the

prominence assigned to the role of money in

the monetary policy decision making process

as a result of the deepening of and innovations

in the financial system. The Central Bank, since

the 1980s, has been pursuing monetary targeting

as its monetary policy framework to achieve price

stability. Accordingly, the final objective of price

stability was to be achieved by influencing monetary

aggregates, with reserve money being the operating

target and broad money being the intermediate

target of monetary policy. Nevertheless, issues

such as the instability in the money demand function

amidst financial developments and innovations, the

rising gap between nominal GDP growth and broad

money growth as well as the weakening relationship

between money and inflation, have reduced the

appeal of monetary targeting in the conduct of

monetary policy. Given these developments, the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka has been introducing

gradual changes to its monetary policy framework,

and currently conducts its monetary policy under an

enhanced monetary policy framework with features

of both inflation targeting and monetary targeting.

Having announced in the "Road Map: Monetary and

Financial Sector Policies" that the Central Bank will

be adopting flexible inflation targeting (FIT) as its

framework for monetary policy in the medium-term,

the Central Bank has accelerated fulfilling technical

requirements of such a framework. In this regard,

the Central Bank is working with international

agencies to improve its modelling and forecasting

capabilities as well as to analyse the required

legislative changes to facilitate inflation targeting.

The government’s ongoing fiscal consolidation

programme is also expected to support a FIT

framework, particularly through reduced reliance

on the Central Bank for financing the fiscal deficit.

The recognition of a medium term inflation target in

the ongoing IMF-EFF Programme is also likely to

support the adoption of FIT. It is expected that the

FIT framework for the conduct of monetary policy

would ensure price stability in the economy on a

sustainable basis, thereby creating an enabling

environment for businesses, by boosting business

confidence, leading to high economic growth.

The Central Bank is in the process of further

improving the quality of data and information

used for monetary policy analysis. Accordingly,

in 2016 with the assistance of the IMF, the

Central Bank commenced reporting monetary and

financial data based on standardised report forms

(SRF) of the IMF. From 2018, the Central Bank is

expected to release an improved set of monetary

statistics along with relevant explanatory notes and

analyses. This methodology assists in expanding

the institutional coverage and the classification of

financial instruments based on liquidity. In addition,

the ongoing efforts to collect the sentiments of the

private sector through various surveys as well as to

disseminate information in a timely manner will also

help the Central Bank in its analyses and managing

expectations while helping the public to better

understand the economic conditions of the country.

Recent domestic and global macroeconomic

developments could pose challenges to the

Central Bank in managing inflation expectations

in the near term. Although, Sri Lanka has been

maintaining single digit inflation continuously for a

period of over eight years, some upward movement

in inflation was observed in the recent past as a

combined outcome of continued monetary and

credit expansion, exchange rate movements, tax

adjustments and supply side disruptions. While the

Central Bank has responded to excessive monetary

and credit expansion through the tightening of

monetary policy, inflation could remain above

the envisaged mid single digit levels due to other

factors for some time in 2017. During this period

of temporary increase in inflation, it is necessary

to manage adverse inflationary expectations of

the public, as any second round effect of these

developments could result in a wage price spiral,

which could derail the achievements so far on the

inflation front.

The Central Bank’s efforts to maintain

inflation within the tolerable mid single digit

levels, need to be supported by appropriate

supply side policies with short, medium

and long term focus. Short term disruptions to

domestic supplies, particularly due to cycles of

adverse weather, and thereby to inflation, cannot

be mitigated through monetary policy measures.

The government, as seen in many occasions, is

better geared to address such disruptions through

appropriate adjustments to tariffs and incentive

structures. In the meantime, policies are required to

increase domestic supply conditions on a sustainable

basis. Continued economic and price stability would

be possible only if both demand and supply policies

are geared towards encouraging more productive

usage of all factors of production.
