2.1 OverviewI

n 2016, Sri Lankan economy grew by

4.4 per cent in real terms compared to

4.8 per cent in 2015, in the midst of

headwinds from both domestic and external

fronts. On the domestic front, recommencement

of a few large scale government infrastructure

projects and private sector investment activities

supported economic growth. However, continuation

of fiscal consolidation measures specifically related

to revenue enhancement, increase in inflationary

pressure towards the latter part of 2016 driven by

supply side impediments and tax policy measures,

tightening of the monetary policy stance of the

Central Bank and adverse weather conditions that

prevailed throughout the year dampened the growth

momentum. Moreover, uncertainty that arose from

frequent policy changes during the beginning of

2016 also impacted the overall economic activity

and was highlighted as a major impediment to

sustain a higher pace of growth by the respondents

to Business Surveys conducted by the Central

Bank. Further, structural constraints, such as the

shortage of skilled labour and low female labour

force participation rate, are beginning to weigh

on continuous expansion in economic activities

as highlighted by the survey participants. On the

external front, slow global economic recovery,

sluggish global trade, tightening interest rates in

the US and heightened policy uncertainty from

unanticipated outcomes of global economic and

political developments that took place throughout

2016 hindered the expected recovery in external

demand.

On the basis of production side estimates,

growth was mainly driven by expansion in

Industry and Services related activities amidst

the contraction recorded in Agriculture

activities due to unfavourable weather

conditions that prevailed throughout 2016.

Growth in Services, the major contributor to the

GDP, was buoyed by a significant increase in

financial services activities and transportation

services. Industry activities recorded a noteworthy

growth in 2016 largely boosted by the recovery in

construction activities and mining and quarrying

activities. Destructive weather conditions, fragile

demand and low prices for Sri Lanka’s major

agricultural commodity exports from destinations

such as Russia and some of the Middle Eastern

countries, also explained the contraction in

Agriculture activities.

As per the expenditure approach estimates,

growth was bolstered by the investment drive,

both in nominal and real terms. Investment

growth was spurred by government infrastructure

activities and the consequent expansion in private

sector involvement in construction activities.

Meanwhile, private consumption registered a

slowdown due to the increase in interest rates

and taxes, gradual increase in import prices

of consumer goods and depreciation of the Sri

Lankan rupee. Government consumption also

witnessed a slowdown with the fiscal consolidation

measures. Further, net external demand

worsened during 2016 in nominal terms. This

was mainly attributable to the impact of increase

in imports compared to exports. Demand for

imports was fuelled by an increase in expenditure

on intermediate and investment goods in line

with the increase in investment activities in the

country. Although exports of goods and services

recorded an expansion in nominal terms, this

was not sufficient to compensate for the growth

in imports, which resulted in a worsening of net

external demand.

Domestic savings increased significantly

as a result of improved private savings in

the backdrop of a gradual tightening of

monetary policy and a decline in government

dis-savings. Further, net current transfers

from the rest of the world continued to grow

significantly supported by improved remittances

contributing positively to national savings.

Meanwhile, net primary income from the rest of

the world contracted in 2016 albeit at a slower

pace compared to the previous year. As a result,

national savings grew substantially during the

year and it increased as a percentage of GDP

compared to 2015. However, the significant

increase in investment resulted in a marginal

broadening of the savings-investment gap

compared to the previous year. Under the

income approach, the gross operating surplus

continued to be the main component of income

generation of the economy while the household

sector contributed to the majority of the income

as an institutional sector in 2016.

2.2 GDP, GDP Per Capita and Gross National Income (GNI)

GDP at current market prices was

estimated at Rs. 11,839.0 billion (US dollars

81.3 billion) in 2016, while it stood at

Rs. 10,951.7 billion (US dollars 80.6 billion) in

2015. Accordingly, GDP in nominal terms grew

by 8.1 per cent in 2016 compared to 5.7 per

cent growth recorded in 2015. This increase was

largely attributable to the upturn in GDP implicit

deflator which increased to 3.6 per cent in 2016

from its 0.8 per cent growth in 2015. Meanwhile,

the GDP increased at constant market prices

to Rs. 9,012.0 billion in 2016 in comparison to

Rs. 8,633.9 billion in 2015 recording a 4.4 per

cent growth in real terms in 2016 compared to

4.8 per cent growth in 2015.

GDP per capita was estimated at

Rs. 558,363 in 2016 compared to Rs. 522,355

recorded in 2015. Accordingly, GDP per capita

grew by 6.9 per cent in 2016 in comparison to

4.7 per cent growth posted in 2015 supported

by the increase in nominal GDP. However, the

per capita GDP in US dollar terms marginally

decreased to US dollars 3,835 in 2016 compared

to US dollars 3,843 in 2015, mainly attributable to

the weakening of the domestic currency against

the US dollar.

GNI, which is derived by adjusting GDP

for the net primary income from the rest of

the world, increased to Rs. 11,506.2 billion in

nominal terms in 2016 resulting in a growth of

7.8 per cent compared to 5.4 per cent growth

recorded in 2015. This growth in GNI was largely

due to the increase in nominal GDP growth and

the slowdown in negative growth of net primary

income in 2016, which recorded a contraction

of 18.3 per cent during the year compared to

19.2 per cent contraction recorded in 2015.

2.3 Contribution from Institutional Sectors

According to the institutional sector

classification of economic activities, the

Households and Non-Profit Institutions

Serving Households (HH and NPISH) sector

continued to be the major sector that

contributed to the value added of the economy.

Accordingly, the HH and NPISH sector accounted

for 50.7 per cent of the total gross value added

of the economy at current market prices in 2016.

Further, the gross value added of HH and NPISH

sector grew by 6.2 per cent in nominal terms in

2016 compared to 5.4 per cent growth recorded in

2015. Meanwhile, the Non-Financial Corporations

(NFC) sector remained the second largest sector of

the economy accounting for a 34.5 per cent share

of the total gross value added in 2016. NFC sector

value added recorded a substantial growth of 8.3

per cent in 2016 compared to 1.4 per cent growth

recorded in 2015. In the meantime, the General

Government (GG) sector which represents the

contribution from the economic activities of the

government grew marginally by 0.2 per cent in

2016 representing 10.1 per cent of the total gross

value added of the economy. Moreover, the gross

value added of the Financial Corporations (FC)

sector represented 4.7 per cent of the economy

growing by 17.3 per cent in 2016 compared to 3.5

per cent growth recorded in 2015.

The HH and NPISH sector primarily contributed

to the gross value added of Agriculture and

Services activities of the economy while Industry

activities were mainly driven by the NFC sector.

Accordingly, the HH and NPISH sector accounted

for 81.4 per cent of the gross value added of

Agricultural activities, while NFC sector contributed

to the balance 18.6 per cent in 2016. Within

Agriculture activities, the contribution from HH and

NPISH sector was significant in fishing, vegetables,

spices and rice. Meanwhile, NFC sector contributed

mostly to animal production and tea. With respect

to Industry activities, the NFC sector accounted for

61.1 per cent of the total gross value added in 2016,

while HH and NPISH, and GG sectors represented

36.6 per cent and 2.2 per cent shares, respectively.

NFC sector accounted for the highest contribution

to the manufacturing activities, followed by HH and

NPISH sector, while the contribution of the GG sector

was limited to construction activities. Meanwhile, all the

four institutional sectors contributed to the gross value

added of the Services activities. The HH and NPISH

sector being the major contributor, accounted for a

53.4 per cent share, while NFC, GG and FC sectors

represented 23.9 per cent, 15.1 per cent and

7.6 per cent of the gross value added of Services

activities, respectively. Further, the HH and NPISH

sector mainly contributed to transportation and other

personal services activities, while the contribution

from NFC sector was mainly visible in wholesale and

retail trade, and transportation activities. Meanwhile,

the FC sector had its major presence in financial and

insurance services, whereas the GG sector primarily

contributed to the public administration, defence

and compulsory social security activities.

2.4 Output, Policies, Institutional Support and Issues

Agriculture

The value added of Agriculture activities

contracted by 4.2 per cent in 2016 as opposed

to 4.8 per cent growth recorded in 2015.

The adverse weather conditions that prevailed

throughout the year, particularly the floods due

to heavy rainfalls in the second quarter and the

prolonged drought conditions negatively affected

Agriculture performance. Accordingly, the value

added of rice, tea, rubber and fruits contracted

mainly dampening the growth in Agriculture

activities while cereals, vegetables, oleaginous

fruits, and plant propagation and support activities

to agriculture also contracted in value added terms

during the year. However, animal production,

forestry and logging, fishing, sugar cane and other

beverage crops contributed positively to the growth,

offsetting the overall contraction in Agriculture

activities to a certain extent. The moderation in

the agricultural activities was also witnessed in

the sub-indices of the Agriculture segment of the

Business Outlook Survey (BOS) conducted by

the Central Bank on quarterly basis. Accordingly,

Business Condition, Demand, Production and

Sales sub-indices on average remained below the

neutral level.

Agriculture Production Index

The Agriculture Production Index (API),

which measures the movement of agriculture

and fisheries sector output, recorded an overall

decline of 2.4 per cent in 2016 in comparison

to an overall growth of 4.4 in 2015. Within API,

the sub-indices of paddy, tea, rubber, coconut and

other crops (fruits and other field crops sub sectors)

decreased, while the vegetables sub sector in the

other crop sub index increased in comparison to

the previous year. Although, the livestock activities

increased considerably during the year, the growth

decelerated from 2015 as reflected by the API. The

growth in fisheries activities remained marginal

during 2016, as in the previous year.

Paddy

Paddy production for the year 2016

declined by 8.3 per cent to 4.4 million metric

tons following the record bumper harvest in

2015. The net extent of land harvested during

the year decreased by 7.1 per cent to 1,010,989

hectares, while the paddy yield decreased to

4,372 kilogramme per hectare in 2016 from

4,428 kilogrammes per hectare in 2015. This is

a combined outcome of the increase in 2015/16

Maha production and the decline in 2016 Yala

production. Paddy production in the 2015/16

Maha season at 2.9 million metric tons was

0.9 per cent higher than the production in the

previous Maha season. The marginal increase

in the Maha production can be attributed to

the favourable rainfall experienced during the

latter part of 2015 along with the increased

extent harvested in major producing areas.

The extent harvested during the 2015/16

Maha season increased marginally by

1.2 per cent to 667,483 hectares. However, paddy

yield per hectare during the 2015/16 Maha

season declined slightly by 0.3 per cent to

4,349 kilogrammes, from 4,364 kilogrammes

in the corresponding season in the previous

year, partly owing to the effect of blights and

leaf-roll diseases in certain paddy producing

areas. Meanwhile, paddy production during the

2016 Yala season declined considerably by

21.9 per cent to 1.5 million metric tons

compared to that of 2015, largely due to the

severe tropical storm that caused widespread

flooding and landslides during the second

quarter of 2016, which delayed paddy

cultivation of the Yala season and necessitated

re-cultivation in major producing areas. As a

result, the extent harvested during the 2016

Yala season decreased significantly by 20.0

per cent to 343,506 hectares. The paddy yield

per hectare during the season too declined by

2.4 per cent to 4,417 kilogrammes, from 4,527

kilogrammes in the corresponding Yala season

in 2015. The annual paddy production of both the

Maha and Yala seasons, which was equivalent to

2.8 million metric tons of rice, was estimated to

be adequate to meet the domestic demand for

rice for approximately 14 months.

Paddy prices in the open market remained

low during the first half of the year, supported by

the increased paddy supply and the reduction

in the guaranteed paddy purchasing price.

As proposed in the Budget 2016, the guaranteed

purchasing price of paddy was reduced with a view

to stabilising rice prices in the domestic market.

The guaranteed purchasing prices of paddy for

Keeri Samba remained unchanged at Rs. 50.00

per kilogramme, while that of Samba varieties

were reduced to Rs. 41.00 per kilogramme from

Rs. 50.00 per kilogramme and Nadu from

Rs. 45.00 per kilogramme to Rs. 38.00 per

kilogramme. However, prices of all paddy varieties

escalated in most of the paddy producing areas

during the latter part of 2016, largely due to the

limited supply of paddy to the market, caused by

the low production in the 2016 Yala season. In

line with the increase in paddy prices, the average

retail prices of Samba and Nadu, the most used

varieties, increased in 2016 by 1.7 per cent and

2.0 per cent, respectively.

The importation of rice in 2016 witnessed a

significant decline in response to the upward

revision of taxes on rice imports imposed

during 2015 and 2016, and the buildup of

rice stocks in 2015 as a result of the bumper

harvest. The quantum of rice imports commenced

declining in the second quarter of 2015 in response

to an upward adjustment of the Special Commodity

Levy (SCL) on rice imports, and this trend continued

in the first 10 months of 2016. To curtail rice imports

further, a new tax structure was implemented with

effect from 01 November 2016, consisting of a

customs duty of Rs. 50, Value Added Tax (VAT)

of 15.0 per cent, Port and Airport Levy of 7.5 per

cent and Nation Building Tax of 2.0 per cent per

kilogramme of imported rice. As a result of the

increase in the tax imposed over a period, rice

imports during 2016 recorded a significant decline

of 89.7 per cent to 29,524 metric tons from 285,604

metric tons imported during the previous year.

Towards the end of the year however, the shortage

in the supply of paddy caused an increase in retail

rice prices and the government took measures to

stabilise rice prices by augmenting the supply with

imported rice. The government reduced taxes on

imported rice varieties such as Samba, Nadu and

brown raw rice with effect from 09 January 2017

by removing the taxes imposed in November 2016

while introducing a SCL of Rs. 15.00 per kilogramme

for imported rice. The government further reduced

SCL on imported rice to Rs. 5.00, from Rs. 15.00,

with effect from 27 January 2017. These measures

were introduced with a view to discouraging traders

from creating an artificial shortage in the market.

Tea

Tea production in 2016 witnessed a

substantial decline due to both supply and

demand factors. Total tea production in 2016

declined by 11.0 per cent to 292.6 million

kilogrammes from 328.8 million kilogrammes

in 2015. Low grown tea production, which

accounted for around 63.0 per cent of the total

tea production, declined by 9.3 per cent to 183.6

million kilogrammes, whilst high grown and medium

grown tea recorded declines of 14.6 per cent and

12.7 per cent, respectively, to 64.4 million

kilogrammes and 44.5 million kilogrammes,

respectively. Both supply side and demand side

factors contributed to this decline. On the supply

side, the prolonged drought in tea growing areas

during early 2016, the changes in weather patterns

with overcast conditions in mid-2016 and the

severe drought condition experienced during the

third quarter of 2016 had an adverse impact on the

production of tea. On the demand side, low global

commodity prices and the decline in oil and gas

revenues of key tea importing countries adversely

affected the demand for tea in 2016. Meanwhile,

the tea smallholder sector continued to play a

major role, contributing 74.5 per cent to the total

tea production of the country in 2016.

The prices of high, medium and low

grown teas at the Colombo Tea Auction

(CTA) throughout the year were above

the corresponding prices recorded in

2015. Accordingly, the average price of tea

at the CTA increased by 17.8 per cent to

Rs. 473.15 per kilogramme in 2016, from

Rs. 401.46 per kilogramme recorded in the previous

year. The highest year-on-year increase in average

tea prices at CTA was recorded for medium grown

tea (17.6 per cent), followed by low grown tea

(17.4 per cent) and high grown tea

(16.5 per cent). The average export price (FOB)

increased marginally by 0.6 per cent to US

dollars 4.39 per kilogramme in 2016 from US

dollars 4.37 per kilogramme in 2015. However,

local tea exporters benefitted from the depreciation

of the Sri Lankan Rupee against the US Dollar

by 3.8 per cent during 2016, whereby the

export price in rupees registered an increase of

7.9 per cent, from Rs. 593.08 per kilogramme in 2015

to Rs. 639.88 per kilogramme in 2016. The average

price received by smallholders for a green leaf

increased to Rs. 68.53 per kilogramme in 2016 from

Rs. 58.80 per kilogramme in 2015. Even if global

market conditions improve, rigidities in the domestic

supply and rising costs of production could make it

challenging for the domestic tea industry to reap

the full benefit of such an improvement in 2017.

Rubber

The decline in production of rubber in 2016

was due to the reduction of both the extent

under tapping and the number of tapping

days, in response to lower prices mainly in

the smallholder sector. Rubber production at

79.1 million kilogrammes in 2016 declined by

10.7 per cent to record the lowest production

volume reported in the past 50 years. The

production of sheet rubber, which accounts for

nearly 50 per cent of the total production, declined

by 10.4 per cent to 39.8 million kilogrammes, while

the production of crepe increased by 35.1 per cent

to 15.0 million kilogrammes and other categories of

rubber decreased by 25.6 per cent to 24.6 million

kilogrammes in 2016. The extent under tapping has

declined over the years as a result of competition

for land for more lucrative agricultural crops such

as oil palm and for real estate development. The

low prices over a considerable period of time has

led to the abandonment of tapping in marginal

lands, as proceeds could not even cover the cost

of tapping. Although local rubber prices improved

during the latter part of the year, production did not

respond immediately to improved prices owing to the

degraded condition of some rubber lands. However,

yield per hectare increased by 3.9 per cent to 851

kilogrammes in 2016, mainly due to the reduction of

the extent under tapping in marginal lands. Domestic

consumption of rubber in the industrial sector, which

has stagnated during the last few years, increased

marginally to reach 69 million kilogrammes,

accounting for 87.2 per cent of the domestic rubber

production. Natural rubber exports declined by

55.8 per cent to 16.2 million kilogrammes and the

cost of production of rubber increased by 5.9 per cent

to Rs 180.00 per kilogramme in 2016. Prices at the

Colombo Rubber Auction decreased during the year,

as a result of a slowdown in global demand owing

to high inventories in major consuming countries,

including China and Japan, and the subdued global

prices caused mainly by low international crude oil

prices. The average price of Ribbed Smoked Sheet 1

(RSS1) at Rs. 239.28 per kilogramme at the Colombo

Rubber Auction in 2016 witnessed a 3.6 per cent

decline over the average price recorded in 2015.

Meanwhile, the price of latex rubber also decreased

by 13.0 per cent to Rs. 262.31 per kilogramme

during the year. The average price of natural

rubber per kilogramme declined by 30.1 per cent to

US dollars 1.6 in 2016 from US dollars 2.2 recorded

in 2015. As a result of the decrease in prices, the

profit margin available to the producer remained low,

making rubber cultivation less attractive.

Coconut

The supply of coconut and coconut

products experienced a slowdown during the

year. Coconut production in 2016, estimated at

3,011 million nuts, declined by 1.5 per cent over

the output recorded last year. The decrease in

the coconut production was mainly due to the low

rainfall received in main coconut growing areas in

2

2016. In line with the increased industrial demand,

desiccated coconut production, which reported a

17.1 per cent contraction in 2015, rebounded with

a growth of 22.3 per cent, recording the highest

quantum of desiccated coconut production in the

last decade. Meanwhile, coconut oil production

decreased by 7.5 per cent, caused mainly by the

increased prices of fresh nuts. Desiccated coconut

exports of 72,000 metric tons, recorded a significant

growth of 56.7 per cent from the previous year.

High domestic prices for coconut, amidst

the low production, were partly attributed to

the increased demand from coconut based

industries and high export prices. In 2016, the

average retail price of fresh nuts decreased by

8.3 per cent to Rs. 45.82 per nut. During the year,

domestic prices for desiccated coconut decreased

by 8.7 per cent, from Rs. 290.65 per kilogramme in

2015 to Rs. 265.27 per kilogramme in 2016. The

average FOB price of kernel products declined

by 25.4 per cent to Rs. 328.30 per kilogramme,

against Rs. 439.94 per kilogramme in the previous

year. In the local market, the price of coconut oil

increased by 4.3 per cent to Rs. 215.34 per bottle

of 750 millilitres. The three kernel product exports,

namely, desiccated coconut, copra and coconut oil,

increased by 38.5 per cent, with export earnings

from these products increasing by 4.5 per cent.

Exports of fresh nuts increased by 130.5 per

cent, coconut cream increased by 27.1 per cent,

coconut milk exports increased by 38.9 per cent

while exports of coconut milk powder decreased by

32.5 per cent.

Minor Export Crops

The production of minor export crops

recorded a decline due to adverse weather

conditions and cyclical seasonal patterns.

According to the provisional estimates provided

by the Department of Export Agricluture, the

production of minor export crops in 2016

contracted by 9.5 per cent, compared to

12.9 per cent growth that was recorded in 2015. The

production of cinnamon, cardamom, coffee, cocoa

and nutmeg registered a growth in 2016, while the

production of pepper, clove and arecanut declined.

Production of cinnamon increased considerably by

7.0 per cent to 18,945 metric tons in 2016 from

17,707 metric tons in 2015. Production of cocoa

grew by 42.2 per cent to 650 metric tons, nutmeg by

51.1 per cent to 4,155 metric tons and coffee by

7.0 per cent to 2,824 metric tons. Severely affected

by the continuous drought during the flowering

and fruiting seasons, the pepper harvest declined

by 34.4 per cent in comparison to the previous

year. Farm gate prices of pepper increased by

14.3 per cent, reflecting the high demand in 2016.

Meanwhile, the significant decline of 65.3 per cent

in clove production was mainly due to the cyclical

harvesting patterns, which produces a bumper

harvest every other year. The export volumes

of cloves and pepper declined significantly by

71.2 per cent and 52.7 per cent, respectively, in

2016. Cashew kernel production increased by

4.9 per cent to 3,192 metric tons and the

extent cultivated increased by 7.6 per cent to

20,102 hectares in 2016. The increase in

production was achieved amidst the unexpected

heavy rainfall experienced during the flowering and

fruiting season in cashew growing areas. Despite

the increase in production, the farm gate prices of

cashew increased by 5.3 per cent during the year.

Other Field Crops

The production of other field crops

(OFCs) observed a decline due to the impact

of adverse weather conditions during the

year. The production of OFC declined by 6.4

per cent to 339,253 metric tons in 2016 from

362,452 metric tons in 2015. The production of finger

millet (kurakkan), maize, green gram, soya beans,

black gram, chilli, potatoes, big onion and ground

nuts declined in 2016 mainly due to the drop in the

extent under cultivation. Meanwhile, the production

of sorghum, cowpea, gingelly and red onions

increased in 2016, in comparison to 2015, largely

due to the higher production in Jaffna and Puttalam

districts. Notably, the output of big onions declined

by 26.7 per cent to 65,223 metric tons during the

year, and consequently, imports of big onions

increased by 2.5 per cent to 215,593 metric tons

supported by low international prices. Although the

production of potatoes decreased by 1.6 per cent

to 95,805 metric tons in 2016, the importation of

potatoes increased by 4.2 per cent. The production

of raw ginger and turmeric also rose due to an

increase in the extent cultivated with the support

extended by the Ministry of Agriculture. According

to provisional estimates of the Department of

Census and Statistics, the total extent of land used

for the cultivation of OFCs in 2016 declined by

4.6 per cent to 144,892 hectares, owing to adverse

weather conditions.

Vegetables

Supply of vegetables continued to increase

in 2016. Total vegetable production increased

marginally by 1.3 per cent to 1,648,501 metric

tons in 2016, compared to 1,627,592 metric tons

in 2015. Although this was mainly due to the

impact of the increase in vegetable production

in 2016 Yala season by 10.4 per cent over the

corresponding period in 2015, the 4.9 per cent

decline in the 2015/16 Maha production, as a result

of the prolonged dry weather conditions in the first

four months of the year, reflected the marginal

increase observed during the year. The increased

production during 2016 Yala season is mainly

due to the increase in the extent of land used for

vegetable cultivation, following the failing of paddy

cultivation in the Yala season, due to the drought

that prevailed during the end of 2016. Responding to

the reduced vegetable supply in the Maha season,

both up-country and low-country vegetable prices

increased in May 2016. In addition, crop damages

and interruptions of supplies caused by the heavy

rain and flood in May 2016 further aggravated the

level of vegetable prices. Meanwhile, vegetable

cultivation in the intermediate season also declined

due to weather related setbacks. Nevertheless,

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

55

the supply of vegetables increased considerably

in the Yala harvesting period, resulting in prices

decreasing from August onwards. Further, the

significant improvement of vegetable supply from

the Northern Province, as a result of increased

extent under cultivation, helped reduce price

pressures in the vegetable market throughout

the year. Towards the end of the year, however,

following the seasonal pattern, vegetable prices

increased again. During 2016, 21.1 million

kilogrammes of vegetables with a value of

Rs. 3.9 billion were exported. To protect farmers and

consumers, strong policy measures are necessary

to educate farmers on Good Agricultural Practices

(GAP) at the nurseries, and popularise improved

technologies on crop cultivation and processing,

which can help increase the productivity of the

sector.

Fruits

Fruit production continued to decline in 2016

although it was in high demand by exporters. Fruit

production declined further by 6.0 per cent in 2016

following the 15.6 per cent decline observed in the

previous year. Variety wise, orange, lime, mango,

avocado and passion fruit production increased

during the year, while banana, papaw, pineapple,

rambutan, guava and melon registered a decline.

Sri Lanka imported 54,107 metric tons of fresh fruits,

incurring a cost of Rs. 7.3 billion during 2016. This

was an increase of 19.8 per cent over the quantity

imported in 2015. As in the preceding year, apples,

oranges, mandarins and grapes were the main

varieties of fresh fruit imported. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka

exported 33,300 metric tons of fresh fruits worth

Rs. 5.0 billion during 2016, resulting in a trade deficit

of Rs. 2.3 billion in 2016. Even though there is a good

export demand for local fruits and vegetables, the

inability to supply large quantities on a continuous

basis is a major constraint. Establishing direct links

between producers and exporters, and further

development of the contract farming system are

important to improve the fruit and vegetable export

market.

Sugar

Sugar production recorded a considerable

increase in production during 2016. Sugar

production that rose remarkably to 55,972 metric tons

in 2015, recorded a further increase of 10.9 per cent to

62,048 metric tons in 2016. Cultivation of high yielding

sugar cane varieties, access to proper irrigation

systems and field maintenance, and the expansion

in planting activities of out-growers were the main

contributory factors to the increased production in

2016. The Pelwatte and the Sevanagala factories

contributed to this improvement in production, amidst

the negative performance of the Gal Oya factory. The

Pelwatte factory reported a 23.8 per cent increase

in production, to 34,188 metric tons in 2016. The

Pelwatte factory, which accounted for 49.3 per cent

of the total sugar production in 2015, consolidated

its position further during the year by increasing its

share to 55.1 per cent. The Sevanagala factory

recorded a 19.9 per cent increase in production to

17,234 metric tons in 2016. Meanwhile, for the

second consecutive year, the production of the

Gal Oya factory declined by 24.0 per cent to

10,626 metric tons in 2016. Reduced availability

and the poor quality of sugar cane, resulting mainly

from adverse weather conditions, appeared to have

contributed to the poor production performance

at the Gal Oya. Given these developments, the

Sugar Recovery Rate,1 which is an indicator of

productivity, marginally increased to 7.6 per cent

in 2016, from 7.5 per cent in the previous year.

It is estimated that the overall domestic sugar

production in 2016 was sufficient to meet around

1 Sugar Produced

Quantity of Cane Crushed

x 100 Sugar Recovery Rate =

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

56

9.5 per cent of the total sugar requirement of the

country. The increased demand, along with the low

SCL on sugar imports, led to an increase in sugar

imports by 4.4 per cent to 651,181 metric tons.

Recognising the vast potential as well as the need for

the promotion of sugar cultivation of out-growers, the

Pelwatte and the Sevanagala factories accorded high

priority to the expansion of the existing out-grower

schemes.

Fisheries

The fisheries sector expanded moderately

in 2016. Fish production in 2016 increased by

2.1 per cent over 2015 to 530,920 metric tons. The

marine sector production, consisting of coastal

and off shore sub sectors, which accounted for

86.0 per cent of total fish production, increased by

0.9 per cent to 456,990 metric tons. The production

of coastal fish marginally increased by 1.9 per cent

to 274,160 metric tons, while the off shore fish

production recorded a 0.6 per cent decline to 182,830

metric tons. Fish production of the inland fishery and

aquaculture sector, which accounts for the balance

14.0 per cent of the total production, increased

significantly by 9.9 per cent compared to 2015.

Growth in the inland fishery and aquaculture sectors

was due to the increase in the release of fingerlings

to inland reservoirs as well as improvements in the

aquaculture sector. Total fish imports decreased by

3.6 per cent to 115,693 metric tons, while dried or

salted fish imports increased by 5.8 per cent to 34,978

metric tons during the year. Meanwhile, canned fish

imports decreased considerably by 24.3 per cent to

37,089 metric tons. With the lifting of the European

Union (EU) ban on Sri Lankan sea food exports, with

effect from 21 June 2016, the demand from the EU

for Sri Lankan fish varieties expanded. Accordingly,

fish exports to the EU increased significantly

by 23.1 per cent to 2,540 metric tons in 2016.

Going forward, addressing the large scale post-

harvest losses in the fisheries sector due to poor

handling, estimated at around 25 per cent of the

catch, is vital in harnessing the full potential of the

industry.

Livestock

The total national milk production continued to

expand, with a growth of 2.6 per cent to 384 million

litres in 2016, mainly due to government efforts to

achieve self-sufficiency in milk. The increase in

production can be attributed to a range of factors, from

the commencement of milking from imported heifers

at the Ridiyagama farm, farmers receiving attractive

prices for raw milk and growing demand for raw milk

from large milk collectors with increased capacity at

milk factories. Cattle milk production, which accounted

for 82.8 per cent of total milk production, increased by

4.1 per cent, year-on-year, to 317.9 million litres, whilst

buffalo milk production decreased by 4.2 per cent to

66.1 million litres. The domestic milk production is

sufficient to meet 42.0 per cent of the total demand

at present. Meanwhile, milking cows decreased by

5.6 per cent to 284,400 and the number of buffalo

milking cows decreased by 9.2 per cent to 83,150.

Until 2015, the cattle population had been given as an

estimate. In 2016, a headcount was conducted with

the participation of Livestock Development Instructors

attached to the Department of Animal Production and

Health, which listed the cattle population by collecting

data from the smallest service delivery units across

the country. As a result of this headcount, the cattle

population figures for 2016 reflect the actual number

of cattle in Sri Lanka and the percentage change in the

herd number reflects the reconciliation of the earlier

estimated figure with the current headcount. Milk

production at the National Livestock Development

Board (NLDB) increased to 17.9 million litres in

2016 from 11.0 million litres, while MILCO (Pvt)

Ltd. increased its milk collection by 9.4 per cent to

70.0 million litres. The modernisation of factories

managed by MILCO (Pvt) Ltd. located in Polonnaruwa

and Digana, with a view to increasing the processing

capacity, was completed and the Ambewela factory

will be completed by the end of the first quarter of

2017. The national average cost of the production

of milk reduced by Rs. 2.67 per litre to Rs. 31.99 per

litre due to the price reduction of coconut poonac

compared to 2015, while the average farm gate

price increased by Rs. 5.00 per litre to Rs. 64.00 per

litre, leading to higher earnings for farmers. Despite

increased production, milk powder imports valued at

Rs. 33.6 billion in 2016 increased by 15.0 per cent

to 94,011 metric tons. The government continued to

pay attention towards upgrading the quality of cattle in

the country by implementing numerous programmes

such as the heifer calf rearing project, which registered

16,577 calves in 2016. These measures can lower the

amount of milk powder imported and enhance the

quality of milk produced in local dairy farms to meet

international standards.

The poultry sector continued its growth

momentum in 2016. According to provisional

estimates of the Department of Animal Production

and Health, chicken production recorded a growth

of 5.7 per cent to 173,830 metric tons. Increased

chicken production was mainly driven by the increase

in imports of broiler parents and layer parents by

88.7 per cent and 107.7 per cent, respectively.

However, the cost of production of chicken increased to

Rs. 306.74 per kilogramme of dressed weight in 2016,

from Rs. 291.16 per kilogramme in 2015. In spite of

the increased production, prices of chicken increased

in 2016, with the average price of fresh chicken at

Rs. 538.56 per kilogramme in comparison to

Rs. 507.90 per kilogramme in the previous year. The

ceiling price imposed for broiler chicken which was

Rs. 420.00 per kilogramme was removed with effect

from 14 March 2017. Meanwhile, egg production

increased by 8.5 per cent to 2.0 billion,

whereas the average cost of production of

eggs increased from Rs. 10.07 to Rs. 12.41.

The average price of an egg increased to

Rs. 16.10 in 2016 from Rs. 14.80 in 2015. The

production of pork and mutton increased by

1.4 per cent and 3.7 per cent to 7,280 metric tons

and 1,400 metric tons, respectively, while beef

production declined by 2.0 per cent to 31,540

metric tons. The cost of production of pork was

Rs. 264.58 per kilogramme, while that of mutton

and beef was Rs. 281.15 per kilogramme and

Rs. 357.37 per kilogramme, respectively. The

average prices of pork increased by 8.2 per cent,

mutton by 12.2 per cent and beef by 18.5 per cent.

Forestry

The forest cover of Sri Lanka is 1,951,472

hectares according to the Forest Cover

Estimation Survey conducted by the Forest

Department. This survey however, is conducted

once in every ten years and as a result the

latest information available is from the last

survey conducted in 2010. Due to illegal logging,

settlements and chena cultivation, the extent

of natural forest cover has deteriorated over

time. Hence, a methodical survey needs to

be conducted at higher frequencies, making

use of the latest technologies available to

assess the changes in the forest cover of the

country in a timely manner. During the year,

the extent deforested for timber extraction was

781 hectares, compared to 423 hectares in 2015,

and the extent reforested under hilltop planting,

enrichment planting and buffer zone planting was

100 hectares. The United Nations Programme

on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and

Forest Degradation (UN-REDD) continued to

function in Sri Lanka during 2016 and supported

the development of a national strategy for

REDD++2 implementation, the designing of

National Forest Inventory for Sri Lanka, the

development of a National Forest Monitoring

System and submission of a National Forest

Reference Level (FRL) to the United Nations

Framework Convention on Climate Change

(UNFCC). The Sri Lanka Community Forestry

programme, which is being implemented since

2012, continued in 2016 by providing training on

skill development and providing material support

to establish micro enterprises. Under the forest

enhancement programme that commenced in

2014 with a view to increase the forest cover of

the country up to 32.0 per cent of the land area by

2019, from 29.7 in 2016, the Forest Department

carried out activities aimed at the rehabilitation

of degraded forests and protection of existing

forests during 2016. Meanwhile, under the private

sector reforestation programme, the extent of

commercial scale private forest plantations was

413 hectares in 2016.

2 REDD++ is the programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) and all transitions in land cover that affect carbon storage, whether peatland or mineral soil, trees outside forest, agro forest, plantations or natural forest.

Agriculture Policies and Institutional Support

The government Food Production National

Programme (FPNP) for the period 2016 – 2018

focuses on several targets. These include targets to

make the country self sufficient in maize, soya beans,

chilies, onions, and potatoes by 2018 through crop

diversification and productivity improvements, while

facilitating the movement of subsistence farming into

agri-business by 2020. Further, the FPNP focuses on

achieving food security, ensuring higher and more

sustainable income and remunerative prices for

farmers, uninterrupted access to competitive markets,

both in Sri Lanka and abroad. In addition, the FPNP also

aims at introducing farm mechanisation, expanding the

extent under cultivation, reducing wastage in transit

and ensuring environmental conservation, introducing

efficient farm management techniques and using high

yielding seeds and improved water management.

Accordingly, since 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture

instigated the home gardening promotion programme

under FPNP, aimed at developing 500,000 home

gardens. This programme will be helpful not only to

fulfil the food and nutrition requirement of a household,

but also to augment the overall food production of

the country. While the government has taken steps

to improve food security and ensure environment

sustainability in relation to the agricultural sector, the

country needs to adopt a comprehensive approach

towards increasing productivity of all food categories

instead of merely concentrating on achieving food

security.

The government introduced several measures

to enhance paddy production and stabilise

paddy prices. To mitigate health and environmental

issues such as water pollution due to the excessive

use of fertilizer, the government initiated a National

Programme named "A Wholesome Agriculture -

A Healthy Populace - A Toxin Free Nation", with

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

59

the intention of preventing the use of highly toxic

agrochemicals in the farming sector. The three year

programme will focus on increasing the use of

traditional varieties of rice (30.0 per cent over

3 years through 2016 - 2019), phase out chemical

fertiliser and pesticide usage, and promote organic

agriculture. The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB)

purchased a stock of 131,981 metric tons of paddy

from the 2015/16 Maha harvest, in comparison to

160,000 metric tons in the 2014/15 Maha season

and was able to purchase only 25,447 metric tons

of paddy from the market in the 2016 Yala season,

compared to 175,270 metric tons purchased in the

2015 Yala season. The purchased amount in the

2016 Yala season was equivalent to 21.2 per cent

of the targeted volume. This was in addition to the

reduced harvest and the result of the private sector

paddy millers speculatively purchasing paddy from

farmers at higher prices. It is necessary to rationalise

the paddy purchasing programme by purchasing

and releasing paddy stocks at the correct time.

This will benefit all the stakeholders; farmers,

consumers as well as the PMB. Meanwhile, the

Rice Research and Development Institute (RRDI)

developed several new hybrid short-duration rice

varieties with drought resistant and flood proof

modifications, which produce 20.0 per cent more

potential yield levels. The RRDI also introduced an

improved method (parachute method) for sowing

paddy, which significantly reduces the requirement

of seed paddy as well as labour costs.

The Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB), Tea

Research Institute (TRI) and Tea Small Holdings

Development Authority (TSHDA) continued

their development activities with a focus

on improving productivity, competitiveness

and technological enhancement, while

promoting the adoption of best practices for

the development of the tea sector in 2016. The

SLTB took strategic marketing action to promote

generic tea under the brand of “Pure Ceylon Tea

packed in Sri Lanka” across the tea markets and

attended international trade fairs and exhibitions.

The SLTB also undertook the task of evaluating

and implementing Good Manufacturing Practices

(GMP) standards at tea factories and warehouses

and a GMP assessment was carried out for

upgrading tea factories. The “B Leaf 60” programme

carried out by SLTB with the aim of upgrading the

average best leaf standard from 33.0 per cent to

60.0 per cent, to minimise post-harvest losses,

continued to be implemented through awareness

programmes, regulatory activities and monitoring

quality. In order to reduce the risk of safety hazards

in food, factories continued to obtain the Hazard

Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)

Certification and during the year 2016, 40 factories

obtained the HACCP Certification. The subsidy

scheme under the tea factory modernisation

granted a total of Rs. 26.1 million to 21 factories.

The TRI, as the national institute for generating

and disseminating new technologies related to tea

cultivation and processing, undertook research and

development strategies, and extension activities

as per the TRI Strategic Plan 2013 – 2017, to

address the present needs of the tea industry. New

tea cultivars such as TRI 5000 series with higher

tolerance to stresses such as climate change,

blister blight and more adaptive to all major tea

growing regions were developed under crop

improvement. An integrated approach was adopted

towards soil fertility management by validating the

soil quality index, which will facilitate the decision

making process of soil rehabilitation practice in

replanting lands. Integrated crop management

and protection approaches were introduced to

minimise damage and address health, safety and

environmental issues. Mechanical harvesters and

devices were introduced among tea small holders

to increase labour productivity and ensure industry

sustainability. Sustainable farming systems

with organically cultivated experimental blocks

continued. The TSHDA implemented the Tea

New Planting and Crop Rehabilitation Subsidy

Programme and the Tea Replanting Subsidy

Programme in collaboration with SLTB. Throughout

the year 2016, 108 hectares were newly planted at

a cost of Rs. 48.3 million, while around 741 hectares

were replanted at a cost of Rs. 484 million under the

above subsidy schemes. The TSHDA implemented

the National Fertiliser Subsidy Scheme where

Rs. 15,000.00 per hectare was given for tea

smallholders who owned between less than one

hectare and over 20 perches of land cultivated for

tea. In 2016, 204,554 beneficiaries received the

subsidy, amounting to Rs. 1.3 billion for 83,864

hectares of tea cultivated land.

The Rubber Development Department

(RDD) and the Rubber Research Institute (RRI)

steered the development strategy for the rubber

sector to improve productivity and explore

new ventures to increase the local production

of rubber and mitigate the effect of volatile

prices for rubber in the global market. The main

strategic plan of RDD was focused on increasing

the national rubber production up to 200,000 metric

tons by year 2020, from 79,100 metric tons as of

now. Productivity improvements and the expansion

of rubber cultivation to non-traditional areas are

the main strategies implemented in 2016 to move

towards the target. The subsidy scheme for rubber

replanting and new planting for smallholders

continued in 2016 as well, disbursing around

Rs. 193.0 million for the replanting of 538.0

hectares and Rs. 179.9 million for new planting of

592.5 hectares, during the year. Ampara, Mullaitivu

and Vavuniya districts have been identified with the

intention of expanding rubber cultivation into non-

traditional areas. During the year, 212.6 hectares

in the Ampara district were newly planted. The

RDD implemented the Rubber Fertiliser Subsidy

Programme since May 2016 and disbursed

Rs. 91.1 million over 38,472 beneficiaries. An

expert group has been set up by the Association

of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC)

to develop recommendations on stabilising global

rubber prices. The RRI expanded its research

and development efforts for the benefit of the

rubber industry in 2016. Major decisions taken by

RRI to support the rubber sector in the midst of

declining rubber prices included, promoting value

addition in raw rubber, promoting methodologies

to reduce the cost of production in raw rubber

such as low intensity harvesting, promoting

intercropping systems for increased income and

improved growth of rubber, and promoting rubber

cultivation in participatory forestry programmes.

Major research highlights of the year included,

identifying a suitable slow release fertiliser for

rubber nursery plants, to reduce overall fertiliser

application, promoting soil fertility management

in rubber cultivations with the combined use of

bio fertiliser with inorganic fertiliser for long term

sustainable yields, popularising new high yielding

clones in the smallholder sector, identifying

disease resistant rubber clones to avoid sudden

disease outbreaks and promoting environmental

friendly agro management practices. Rubber

smallholders, united through “Thurusaviya”

societies, were trained on improving their

knowledge on producing high quality rubber sheets,

and machines and equipment were distributed

among them as per the standards specified by the

RRI, with the expectation of obtaining high quality

rubber sheets.

The Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB),

the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) and

the Coconut Development Authority (CDA)

focused on improving the productivity of

coconut palm and coconut land, expanding

coconut cultivation and engaging in research

and development activities to produce disease

resistant seedlings and promote coconut

exports in various forms. During 2016, CCB

implemented strategies to increase coconut

production, coconut land area and coconut land

productivity. Subsidy schemes were initiated to

increase the productivity of coconut palm through

providing fertiliser for coconut plantations, establish

husk pits and soil conservation, implement low cost

hose irrigation, moisture conservation and inter-

cropping. The CRI monitored the developments

in the sector together with CDA and CCB, and

provided policy recommendations, including the

promotion of fresh nut exports, the regularisation

of CDA Auction and the increasing of tariffs

on imported edible oils. The CRI continued to

maintain the buffer zone of the Weligama Coconut

Leaf Wilt Disease (WCLWD) and acquired land

from CCB to commence a seed garden in the

Weligama area, to produce seedlings resistant

to WCLWD. The “Kapruka” programme was

strengthened to organise coconut smallholders as

community based organisations to engage them in

extension programmes, pest and disease control

programmes and establish coconut cultivation

models to demonstrate inter cropping and promote

animal husbandry in coconut cultivations to

increase land productivity. Approval has also been

granted to establish two new factories engaged

in desiccated coconut production. Coconut fibre

millers and processors were encouraged to obtain

GMP Certifications and new market opportunities

were explored in 2016 to make the coconut industry

more profitable and attractive.

Although commercial sugar production in

Sri Lanka commenced several decades ago, the

industry is still plagued with several structural

problems. Given that Sri Lanka has not been able

to create an enabling environment for the sugar

industry, it is essential to create a favourable

legal, institutional and regulatory framework for

the development of the industry. Low sugarcane

availability and yields, high cost of production,

weather related disturbances, poor recovery rates

and labour problems have adversely impacted the

industry. Considering these issues, the government

initiated a programme for Scientific Cooperation

between the Sugarcane Research Institute, Sri

Lanka and Vasantdada Sugar Institute, India, to

develop sugarcane cultivation and processing.

Meanwhile, in 2016, the Sugarcane Research

Institute identified five new varieties of sugarcane

for commercial testing. Arrangements have been

made by the government to re-establish the Kantale

Sugar Factory as a public-private partnership

(PPP). As proposed in the Budget 2017, on

01 January 2017, a minimum purchasing price

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

62

of Rs. 5,000.00 per metric ton of sugarcane was

imposed to encourage local farmers to cultivate

sugarcane, and to establish a Sugar Stabilisation

Fund to protect the sugarcane farmers from the

adverse impact that may arise from fluctuations in

price and loss of crop, due to attacks of pests and

wild elephants.

During the year, institutions under the

Department of Agriculture (DOA) continued

to conduct programmes in line with the

government policy to improve the domestic

agricultural sector in the country. The Rice

Research Institute introduced three new high

yielding rice varieties namely, BG 252, LD 253,

and BG 374, with realisable yield potential of

4.5 – 5.0 metric tons per hectare, which are more

resistant to pests and diseases. Since chemical

control is costly and pollutes the environment,

developing resistant varieties for pests and

diseases is the best option as it is environmentally

friendly and cost efficient. In the OFC sector, the

releases of a new maize variety, MI Maize Hybrid

02 with an average yield around 5.5 - 6.5 metric

tons per hectare and a new green gram (mung)

variety, MI 7, of which over 80.0 per cent of the

yield can be obtained from the first harvest, were

the significant improvements reported in the year.

Further, seed paddy production programmes under

DOA also showed a significant improvement in

2016. Accordingly, 3,863 metric tons of registered

and certified seed paddy, 855.6 metric tons of

registered, certified and commercial seeds of other

field crops and 9.8 metric tons of standard vegetable

seeds were produced in government seed farms,

under DOA and under contract growing.

The government invested heavily on

expanding irrigation facilities in recent times. In

2016, the Moragahakanda reservoir, which is the

largest multi-functional irrigation project and the last

project of the five great reservoirs in the Mahaweli

Master Plan, was completed. The Moragahakanda

reservoir, which spreads over 460,000 acres, is

the fourth largest reservoir in Sri Lanka.The sluice

gates of the Moragahakanda reservoir closed in

January 2017, enabling the filling up of the reservoir

for the first time. Meanwhile, the Kalu Ganga

reservoir was constructed as a twin project with the

Moragahakanda reservoir and water was brought

to Moragahakanda through a canal that spans nine

kilometres. The objective of the overall project is to

collect water at the basin of the Amban River and

to distribute that water to Matale, Anuradhapura,

Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee districts for

agricultural needs. In addition, the project will add

25 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.

Meanwhile, Budget 2017 proposed to develop

several irrigation schemes. Accordingly, Rs. 600

million was allocated to merge two existing tanks

“Kithul” and “Rugam”, and create a bigger reservoir

for irrigation and flood mitigation in the Batticaloa

district for the Kumbukkan Oya Reservoir Project,

which is a multi-purpose project in the district of

Monaragala, and to rehabilitate the Tharapuram

Tank in the Mannar district. Further, Rs. 1 billion

for the Yan Oya Project and Rs. 300 million for

the Lower Malwathu Oya Irrigation Project were

allocated during the year. Rs. 200 million was

allocated to expand the Dam Safety and Water

Resource Planning Project (DSWRP) to establish

an automated monitoring system to collect real-

time data from farming fields, to facilitate the

monitoring of the impact of agrochemicals on water

quality and quantity, with external pressures, in an

area covering eight districts.

The Department of Animal Production

and Health (DAPH) implemented several

programmes in line with the government

policy framework for the development of the

2

dairy sector based on the Livestock Sector

Master Plan. Although the local milk production is

still unable to meet the domestic demand in full,

several measures have been taken to increase the

domestic milk production through upgrading the

cattle, buffalo and goat population by improving

the artificial insemination centres, progeny testing

of bull calves for natural breeding programmes

and pasture development. The Heifer Calf Rearing

Project, wherein support is given to farmers to feed

and manage artificially born female heifer calves

continued in 2016 as well. Institutional support

for livestock development was strengthened

by the Field Veterinary Service Improvement

Programme, establishing four new veterinary

offices in Arachchikattuwa in the Puttalam district,

Welioya in the Mullaitivu district, Nachchaduwa in

the Anuradhapura district and Soranatota in the

Badulla district. The government encouraged the

establishment of Dairy Development Zones to

support backward integration in selected districts

through PPPs, especially on idle or underutilised

land of the National Livestock Development

Board (NLDB). Assistance is to be provided to

self-employed farmers through a gap financing

scheme, by giving ten cattle each, from imported

milk producing cattle breeds to increase the supply

of liquid milk within the country. The decision to

regulate the price of a packet of 400g of milk powder

at Rs. 295, in spite of the increase in international

prices, continued to help both the local milk

producers and the consumers. The government

also proposed to allow millers to import maize,

which is a key ingredient in producing poultry

feed, whenever there is a shortage of domestic

production of maize, subject to a payment of Cess

which is to be reimbursed as a rebate on the export

of chicken. Also the private sector investors were

encouraged to invest in out-grower systems and

provide extension services to improve productivity.

As a result of the measures taken by the

government on restricting illegal, unreported

and unregulated fishing activities, the ban

imposed against Sri Lanka by the EU prohibiting

fish exports to the EU countries, over a period of

one and half years commencing from January

2015, was lifted with effect from 17 June 2016.

The ban on fisheries product exports came into

effect due to Sri Lanka's failure to address the

shortcomings in the implementation of control

measures, a lack of deterrent sanctions on the

high seas fleet, as well as the failure to comply with

international and regional fisheries rules. Although,

the fishing industry is highly capital intensive,

the inflow of capital is not at a desired level, and

considering this deficiency, the Ministry of Fisheries

and Aquatic Resources Development continued to

provide various subsidies to the fishing industry to

support the modernisation of the fishing fleet and

fishing gear. Under the producer subsidy schemes,

13,150 fishing gear units and 664 traditional

craft were issued in 2016 when compared to 990

fishing gear units and 253 traditional craft in 2015.

Recognising the issue of the lack of large fishing

vessels, the government decided to provide a

50.0 per cent grant for manufacturers of boats

longer than 55 feet, enabling fishermen to catch

better quality fish, which attract high prices in

the international market. The Budget 2017 also

proposed several measures to uplift the fisheries

sector. Accordingly, to encourage the introduction

of new technology to multi day boats, with the aim

of improving operational efficiency and reducing

post-harvest losses, Rs. 100 million was allocated

to develop the Gandara fishery harbour and

anchorage. Further, it was proposed to allocate

Rs. 1,200 million to improve the fishery villages

focusing on housing and livelihood development

in 10 coastal districts, including Hambantota,

Batticaloa and Jaffna and also lagoon and coastal

areas of the country. Identifying the potential to

increase export proceeds through the export of value

added products, Rs. 500 million had been allocated

to establish an Aquaculture Industry Zone in the

Mannar district. Rs. 300 million had been allocated

to establish 100 Integrated Inland Fishery Villages

under the “Wewak Sahitha Gamak” programme

with the view of developing the inland fishery

industry, addressing the nutritional deficiencies, and

promoting of industries and creation of employment.

Under the “Diyawara Diriya” loan scheme Stage

II, which is operated by Ministry of Fisheries and

Aquatic Resources Development together with the

Bank of Ceylon, Rs. 42.2 million were released

to 62 applicants in 2016. Having identified the

potential for developing the inland fisheries and

aquaculture sector, 39.6 million post larvae of fresh

water prawn were produced at Natation Aquaculture

Development Authority (NAQDA) hatcheries

and the private hatcheries in 2016. Meanwhile,

38.0 million fresh water prawn post larvae and

64.3 million fingerlings were stocked in water bodies.

The NAQDA implemented several programmes

under the Food Production National Programme

(2016-2018), with the objective of increasing local

fish products both in quality and quantity. Various

activities were implemented during the last few years

to rehabilitate the shrimp farming industry, which was

devastated by the White Spot disease. Accordingly,

regulating shrimp hatcheries and screening of post

larvae of shrimp and brood stock were continued. In

addition, services are being provided at the Shrimp

Farm Monitoring and Extension Unit at Battuluoya for

shrimp farmers to detect shrimp diseases. A shrimp

hatchery has been established at Batticaloa in order

to support shrimp farming in the Eastern Province

and this shrimp farm is managed as a public private

partnership (PPP). The NAQDA facilitated sea weed

farming in Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mannar and Sea

cucumber fattening in Thewanpitti, Mannar South

Bay, Ambupuram, Valaipadu and Nachchikuda by

the private sector. A leading private sector company

commenced commercial scale sea weed farming,

with the participation of around 1,000 farmers in the

Northern Province. Under a MOU signed between

the NAQDA and Vietnam, expertise was provided

to breed sea cucumber in a private hatchery, and

in 2016, 435,000 sea cucumber juveniles were

produced and 61.4 metric tons were harvested.

Industries

The value added of Industry activities

recorded a significant growth of 6.7 per cent

in 2016 in comparison to 2.1 per cent growth

recorded in 2015. The Industry activities which

comprise construction, mining and quarrying,

manufacturing, electricity, water and waste

treatment activities positively contributed to the

overall growth. Construction, and mining and

quarrying activities grew significantly during the

year recovering from the contractions recorded

in 2015. Moreover, manufacturing activities also

grew positively in 2016. Further, electricity, water

and waste treatment activities continued to register

a positive growth. Meanwhile, the BOS sub-indices

related to the Industry segment largely remained in

the positive territory during the year.

Mining and Quarrying

Mining and quarrying activities grew by 14.4

per cent in 2016 in value added terms recovering

from 5.2 per cent contraction recorded in 2015.

The significant recovery in construction activities

stimulated the expansion in mining and quarrying

activities. Further, this recovery was reflected in

the mineral exports volume index which increased

by 7.9 per cent in 2016 recovering from 48.1 per

cent contraction in 2015. Moreover, gem exports

increased by 8.4 per cent in quantity during the

year against 17.1 per cent decline in 2015. The

production of rutile and zircon expanded during the

year, while that of ilmenite contracted. On the other

hand, phosphate production contracted during the

year mainly driven by the low demand for fertiliser

manufacturing.

Manufacturing

The value added of manufacturing activities

grew at a slower pace by 1.7 per cent in 2016

compared to 4.9 per cent growth in 2015. This

slowdown was mainly attributable to the contraction

in the manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco

products, the major manufacturing category, which

contracted by 2.5 per cent in 2016 as opposed

to 3.7 per cent growth recorded in 2015, in value

added terms. Further, value added of manufacture

of other non-metallic mineral products, and

manufacture of textiles, wearing apparel and

leather related products also contracted by

13.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively, during

the year. However, value added of all the other

manufacturing categories remained positive with

main contributions from the manufacture of rubber

and plastic products with 17.9 per cent growth,

manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metal

products with 28.7 per cent growth, and manufacture

of machinery and equipment with 14.1 per cent

growth, buoying the overall growth in manufacturing

activities. Considering the behavior of the Purchasing

Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing activities

compiled by the Central Bank on a monthly basis, the

index witnessed an expansion during the year except

for the months of April and May. On average, all sub-

indices, namely, Production, New Orders, Stock of

Purchases, Employment and Suppliers’ Delivery

Time expanded during the year. Meanwhile, the

Index of Industrial Production (IIP, 2015=100)

compiled monthly by the Department of Census

and Statistics (DCS) increased by 3.3 per cent in

2016.

Factory Industry Production Index3

The factory industry output, the largest

contributor to the manufacturing subsector,

recorded a decline of 2.7 per cent in 2016 due to

weak global demand and subdued international

commodity prices, coupled with supply side

disruptions caused by adverse weather

conditions. The Factory Industry Production Index

3 The weights in the FIPI are assigned for each industry using 2010 as the base year and is computed using the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), Revision 4. At the same time, the Department of Census and Statistics has compiled the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) as a composite indicator that measures short-term changes in the volume of industrial production during a given period, on the basis of a representa-tive basket of industrial products, compared to the chosen base year of 2015. IIP is expected to be used for National Accounts compilation purposes from 2017 onwards. Accordingly, the analysis of the manufacturing sector in the Annual Report 2017 will be carried out using IIP.

(FIPI), which reflects the trends in the manufacturing

sector in terms of production, indicated a mixed

performance in 2016. The production of key

subsectors such as food products, wearing

apparel, beverages, tobacco products, chemicals

and chemical products, fabricated metal products

and electrical equipment were adversely affected.

Notwithstanding, the output of textiles, other non-

metallic mineral products, rubber and plastic

products, refined petroleum products, leather and

related products and basic metal products have

improved during 2016.

The food products subsector, the largest

subsector in FIPI, indicated a contraction

of 3.2 per cent during 2016, reversing the

positive performance observed in 2015. The

manufacturing of dairy products, processed and

preserved meat products, vegetable and animal

oil products and value added tea decreased during

the period. However, the manufacturing of bakery

products, sugar, macaroni and noodles, prepared

meals and dishes reported an increase during

the year. The global turnover of healthy foods is

estimated to reach US dollars 1 trillion in 2017 and

expected to grow further given the global trend

of consumers increasingly seeking healthy food

options. With the abundance of marine resources,

fruits and vegetables, Sri Lanka should explore the

opportunities in the packaged foods industry to take

advantage of the growing demand for packaged

foods in the global market.

The beverages subsector declined by 13.4

per cent mainly due to the lower production of

liquor, the largest category of this subsector.

The disruption to the operations of the largest beer

manufacturer due to floods was the primary cause

of this decline in liquor production. Manufacturing

of malted milk products also experienced a setback

during the year. However, the production of soft

drinks, mineral and bottled water improved during

the year, as a result of high demand due to drought

conditions during the latter part of 2016.

The tobacco products subsector recorded

a decline of 3.2 per cent during 2016. This was

primarily due to the lower consumer demand

arising from higher cigarette prices caused by the

increase in excise duties during the latter part of

2015 and further price increases during 2016. The

price of cigarettes rose between 45.0 to 100.0 per

cent, depending on the brand, in 2016. The last

increase in November 2016 was as a result of

the application of a 15.0 per cent VAT on tobacco

products. It should be noted that higher cigarette

prices may lead to an increased demand for

smuggled cigarettes or cheaper substitutes such

as beedi that cause severe health hazards. In

fact, during the first two months of 2017, Sri Lanka

Customs has seized over ten million illicit cigarettes

entering Sri Lanka, in comparison to around four

million illicit cigarettes seized by Sri Lanka Customs

in 2016. Although import duty was increased on the

importation of Tendu leaves as a measure to curb

the production of beedi, the beedi producers in Sri

Lanka rely on local substitutes for Tendu leaves. This

indicates that stringent measures should be adopted

to curtail the spread of unauthorised and illicit tobacco

products in the country.

The output of the textile subsector grew by

around 2.6 per cent during 2016. The growth of

this subsector was mainly fuelled by the increase in

domestic market demand for textiles. In 2016, around

US dollars 2.7 billion was spent on textiles and textile

articles imports into Sri Lanka. This highlights the

need for exploring the possibility of improving capacity

in both the manufacture of domestic handlooms and

factories producing textiles. Given the fact that some

garment exporters require specific materials, the

industry may focus on producing high value-added

textiles helping the garment industry to benefit from

backward linkages in the industrial sector. Such

initiatives, while enhancing domestic industrial

activities, would contribute to save the country’s

foreign exchange as well.

The wearing apparel subsector, which is the

second largest subsector in FIPI, also witnessed

a slight contraction, reporting a decline of 2.4

per cent during 2016. Decline in export demand

from traditional markets in the USA and EU was

the key reason for the poor performance in this

subsector. However, a growth in garment exports

to non-traditional markets, such as Canada, China,

Australia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)

was observed during 2016. It is expected that the

potential restoration of the GSP+ facility would

make a significant contribution towards the

development of the apparel industry of the country

with increased exports to EU. However, once a

country attains and remains in the upper middle

income country category for three years, the GSP+

facility is terminated. Given the current projected

growth rates, Sri Lanka may reach this status in

the medium term. Therefore, it is imperative that

industry should gear to exploit the full potential

of GSP+ benefits within this short period.

Simultaneously, it is necessary to consider an

expansion of trade agreements with potential

partner countries to help local apparel exporters

diversify export destinations for existing products.

Further, it is necessary to promote industrial

relocation into more remote areas, in particular the

North and East provinces, to address the labour

shortages faced by the industry. Moreover, given

Sri Lanka’s niche positioning as a high-quality

supplier, Sri Lanka should consider to position itself

as a regional apparel trade hub, taking advantage

of logistics infrastructure, geographical location

and the highly skilled labour force.

The production of leather and related products

exhibited a favourable growth of 23.8 per cent in

2016. This subsector was positively impacted by the

renewed demand for footwear and finished leather

products in the domestic market, thus reversing the

negative performance reported since 2014.

Manufacturing to Drive Growth

Sri Lanka has achieved substantial economic and social progress since the economic liberalisation in 1978, in terms of national wealth and improved living standards. However, economic growth in the last few years has been constrained at around 3.0 to 5.0 per cent levels, while exports relative to GDP have declined. The contribution of the manufacturing sector to economic growth has remained low during the last two decades, due to the inability to remain competitive in both domestic and foreign markets, and evolve towards producing high value added products while increasing productivity. The accelerated development achieved by many other nations, through the implementation of strong industrialisation policies during the mid 20th century, demonstrates that the manufacturing sector of a country can play a major catalytic role in a country’s economic and social transformation process. The development of the manufacturing sector can contribute to the eradication of poverty and regional disparity, create quality employment opportunities, increase export income, as well as develop technological capabilities and productive capacities of the economy to support growth. Therefore, at this juncture of Sri Lanka’s growth path, where reliance on foreign aid and government welfare transfers cannot be sustained any longer, there is a crucial need to revitalise the manufacturing sector, for the economy to attain accelerated sustainable growth.

In contrast to nations, which developed through industrialisation, Sri Lanka has leap-frogged from an agrarian society to a service-based economy. The sectoral composition of Sri Lanka’s GDP evolved with the share of the agricultural sector declining, and the services

sector and the non-manufacturing industrial sectors (i.e. construction, mining and quarrying, electricity, water and waste management) increasing substantially (Table B 3.1). The share of the manufacturing sector in GDP remained low and stagnated since 1978 (Table B 3.1), while growth rates of the manufacturing sector remained below GDP growth rates throughout most of the last 15 years (Chart B 3.1). Consequently, the GDP growth rates that Sri Lanka recorded during the last few years emanated mainly from non-tradable services and construction, constraining growth to 3.0 to 5.0 per cent levels, which is inevitable given the limited size of the domestic economy.

Sri Lanka undertook numerous attempts, since economic liberalisation in 1978, to improve the manufacturing sector, through policy measures, such as the establishment of the Export Development Board in 1978 and export processing zones, privatisation of state industrial undertakings, setting up of the Industrialisation Commission in 1991 under the Industrial Promotion Act No. 46 of 1990, carrying out a “200 Garment Factories Programme” in the 1990s, announcement of an industrial policy statement in 1995, launching of the “Productivity Decade 1997-2006”, and formulation of a National Framework for Small and Medium Enterprise Development in 2015. However, the impact of all such measures on Sri Lanka’s factory industries in maintaining competitiveness in local and global markets has been low during recent years. Manufacturing activities have remained highly concentrated among apparel, food products and rubber products and other labour intensive industries producing goods of low technological intensity. GDP growth was less supported by growth in the manufacturing sector, especially after 2000 when Sri Lanka lost comparative advantage from cheap labour in apparel manufacturing to countries with even cheaper labour. The challenges

were compounded by the end of the Multifibre Agreement (MFA) and the loss of the GSP+. During the boom of the apparel manufacturing era, Sri Lanka failed to effectively strategise on diversification into other product categories or for shifting manufacturing to more technologically intensive, high value-added and complex products. Sri Lanka's development pattern corresponds to a concept referred to as “premature deindustrialisation” in academic literature. This is shown to be caused by globalisation forces, which force growth in countries with open economies and a lack of a “head-start” in industrialisation, to be based on capital inflows, foreign aid, remittances and commodity price booms, making only moderate growth possible through a services-based economy.2 This further highlights that Sri Lanka needs to undertake an urgent commitment to develop the manufacturing sector and integrate into global value chains even as a late-entrant, in order to accelerate growth.

International Experience

Many countries that shared a similar economic background to Sri Lanka during the 1950s, undertook government led policy measures to enhance the productive capacities of their manufacturing sectors aimed at increasing exports during the mid 20th century. It is widely stated that, countries in Asia followed a “flying geese pattern” (a tilted V-shape) in adopting government led industrialisation policies, with Japan in the lead, followed initially by South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore (“the four tigers”) and subsequently by many other nations including China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The services sectors of these countries deepened later in the development process. Their Latin American counterparts were Brazil, Chile, Peru and Mexico. All these countries have now surpassed Sri Lanka in GDP and social development.

The above countries adopted clearly stated “industrial policies” at the beginning of their development process. Most countries with subsistence farming simultaneously adopted policies to improve productivity in agriculture through land reforms and other farming techniques. Thus, larger-scale agricultural production evolved, releasing underemployed labour in agriculture to the manufacturing sector until the “Lewisian turning point”3 of full absorption of surplus labour in the traditional sectors to the modernised manufacturing sector was reached. Most of these countries manufactured low value-added consumer goods, such as apparel, in the first phase of their development, but progressed on to complex products with technological skills gained from the previous phase. With the exception of Japan, the other countries adopted the strategy of obtaining direct investment from advanced nations to set up manufacturing plants within special economic

zones in their countries. Meanwhile, domestic small scale enterprises were fostered as they grew into large enterprises and protected from dumping (competition through cheap imports). The technological development that took place in the manufacturing sector triggered transformation in other sectors, such as services and agri-business. The contribution of the manufacturing sector to GDP in these countries increased substantially and is much higher than Sri Lanka (Table B 3.2), while a greater percentage of merchandise exports are manufactured goods. At present, lower-middle income nations such as Vietnam and the Philippines are striving to follow a similar growth path through industrialisation. India, which has leap-frogged to services from agriculture has made a commitment to develop the manufacturing sector via a campaign named "Make in India" which commenced in 2014.

Some of the above nations experienced difficulties at times in maintaining their industrial policies due to the failure of selected industries, inflation in consumer goods markets, macroeconomic volatility caused by reduction in global demand etc. but were successful in achieving rapid economic and social development in the long run because of their continuously evolving manufacturing bases. It is evident that focused and committed policy support from the government for the overall sector, including targeted infrastructure development, research and development, capacity building of human resources and broad fiscal incentives helped to increase the overall manufacturing output. This provides a development lesson for Sri Lanka regarding the importance of the manufacturing sector to development as well as the need for the state to support industrialisation through policy action.

Implementation of the Necessary Strategies

Successive Sri Lankan governments implemented various measures to increase industrial production. Recently, plans have been made to set up industrial zones in regional areas, along the new expressways, and around the Hambantota and Trincomalee Ports. These initiatives, together with all other plans to develop infrastructure, promote research and development, upgrade skills of the human resources, and establish new small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are to be implemented by various government agencies, will help attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and increase manufacturing. Meanwhile, having recognised the importance of policy support for development, the Government has also put in place an overall development strategy and is formulating trade and export related policies. However, there still remains a need for a comprehensive manufacturing sector development strategy, which aligns various government efforts to increase manufacturing activities with the government’s overall development agenda, and provides due prominence to the whole manufacturing sector while addressing its structural issues.

Therefore, in order for Sri Lanka to effectively provide broad-based support to the manufacturing sector and address structural issues, the establishment of one practical manufacturing sector development strategy is necessary. Such a clearly stated policy, which is developed through a collaborative process with all stakeholders, will be a tool for the government to provide long term direction for local and foreign investors as well. This manufacturing sector strategy needs to be a part of Sri Lanka’s overall development strategy. The trade policy and export strategies should be a part of the attempts to industrialise through a manufacturing sector development strategy such that the development process will spur international trade. This is essential for the country to achieve a higher trajectory of growth and development. Furthermore, this strategy must encompass the interplay between the manufacturing sector with the agriculture and service sectors as well. Importantly, productivity enhancement in the agriculture sector will not only transfer under-utilised labour to the manufacturing sector, but also reduce the share of income spent on food. The resultant increase in real income spendable on other goods will increase the demand within the economy for manufactured products.

The manufacturing sector development strategy should categorically address the needs of local investors as well as foreign investors. Similarly, the needs of large scale firms as well as micro, small and medium enterprises be addressed. FDI is crucial as domestic savings are low and fiscal space is constrained. FDI is also an avenue to address low technological know-how in Sri Lanka. FDI relating to technologically intensive and high value adding products, which Sri Lanka seeks to gain competence in, are generally manufactured via global value chains in which manufacturers base different stages of the production process in various locations, to

harness advantages provided by each location for each production stage. Despite this global development, most of the FDI to Sri Lanka in the last ten years comprised investment into the tourism and real estate sectors and investors seeking the Sri Lankan market. Therefore, the future manufacturing sector development strategy must include measures to attract manufacturing based export focused FDI to Sri Lanka.

In order to attract FDI, the manufacturing sector development strategy should identify factors driving such flows and create an environment conducive for them. The FDI flows occur due to push and pull factors relating to the source country and the recipient country, respectively. In general, pull factors include low cost labour, raw material, access to markets, competitive exchange rates, low tax regimes, availability of land for setting up factories etc. Factors that create a conducive environment for FDI include political stability, consistent support by public institutions, sound macroeconomic and legal frameworks, efficient logistics, minimum trade barriers, agglomeration economies and low-cost and highly efficient human resources. Since global value chain producers need to transport product components from one location to another expeditiously and with low transaction costs, efficiency of road and sea transport, access to ports, speed of customs clearance, warehousing and the existence of minimum tariff and non-tariff barriers are critical. In the past, firms in advanced nations invested in developing nations seeking cheap labour and natural resources (North-South FDI). However, during the last decade, South-South FDI, which involve emerging market economies (EMEs) such as China, Malaysia, India and Russia, investing in similar economies has increased. Such countries are more focused on market access and raw materials and have different perceptions about the quality of institutions than firms of advanced nations. Therefore, Sri Lanka needs to cater to the requirements of different FDI sources.

The FDI alone cannot uplift the manufacturing base of the economy in the long-term, and development of the capabilities of local manufacturers is critical. Local firms need to provide support services required by the foreign investors and develop the capacity to absorb technology transfer from the foreign investors. Some Sri Lankan companies, particularly in the tea and apparel sectors, have been able to achieve global excellence standards, but most firms are stricken by low productivity and restrained growth. Data on capacity utilisation in factory industries compiled by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka indicate that not more than 83.0 per cent of installed capacity were utilised from 2011 to 2016. Meanwhile, economic value added in the industrial sector as well as the agricultural sector, in terms of the proportion of the labour force employed gradually declined from 1981 to 2016. This suggests that an increasing proportion of the workforce was used to generate a declining proportion of the total value added of the country. This indicates that labour productivity gradually declined in both the industrial and agricultural sectors. Meanwhile, total factor productivity of Sri Lankan manufacturing firms has also declined, as

identified through academic research that studied firm performance between 1990 and 2010.4 Therefore, the country's development strategy needs to identify means of allocating under-employed labour in less productive agriculture as well as service sector segments (such as petty trade, personal services and public service) to the manufacturing sector. Policies aimed at transforming small scale farming to larger scale agri-business is important (to transfer labour from the agricultural sector). Policies should also aim to improve total factor productivity in the manufacturing sector through worker skill enhancement, management practices, and removal of impediments to restructuring.

Meanwhile, there is a prevalence of a large number of small firms, which neither grow nor exit for a long period of time in Sri Lanka. This results in labour and other resources being locked in less productive activities, as suggested by a World Bank study.5 Small enterprises that do not grow, do not contribute to long term productivity enhancement of the country, as they do not engage in product or process innovation or provide quality employment opportunities. This study estimates that firms with less than 19 workers make up 76.0 per cent of enterprises in Sri Lanka which is a much higher percentage compared to India, China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines and Vietnam. Further, firms aged 25 years or more are only 50.0 to 90.0 per cent larger than firms aged 5 years or less. Larger firms tend to be more productive due to economies of scale, access to finance, ability to attract better quality managers, maintenance of better networks of market access and better record-keeping etc. Therefore, it is important to remove barriers for small and medium scale enterprises to grow by improving access to finance, increasing project-feasibility based lending rather than physical collateral-based lending, modernising labour regulations that hinder termination of employment, upgrade poor accounting and record-keeping, rationalising taxes that deter firms from expanding operations etc. Strong collaboration needs to be built between research and development (R&D) institutions and SMEs such that product development needs of SMEs are identified by the R&D institutions, while their findings are used by the SMEs. R&D institutions need to explore avenues to utilise minerals, herbs and other natural resources in Sri Lanka to increase manufactured exports of domestic industrialists. At present, a lot of such resources are exported in raw or low value-added forms at present. Fostering small enterprises until they grow into large enterprises and protecting them from dumping (by cheap imports) are necessary to uplift domestic manufacturing and gear the sector towards exports. In this connection,

the Anti-dumping Bill should be enacted into Law expeditiously. However, a healthy level of competition needs to be encouraged within industries, and bankruptcy and employment termination regulations need to allow efficient reallocation of resources from firms that restructure or exit to more productive uses. In addition, the proposed trade adjustment package is an important complement to the economic partnership agreements which are being negotiated. It should be well-designed to increase the competitiveness of domestic firms and provide retraining for workers affected by trade liberalisation.

The manufacturing sector development policy should promote cluster based industrial policies and enhance opportunities for agglomeration economies. This is achieved by encouraging similar manufacturers to locate geographically close to each other and their support service providers to cluster around them. In such a context, the government can provide the necessary infrastructure, fiscal incentives and facilities for employees in a more focused manner, while firms can gain through economies of scale in inputs, interaction with each-other, larger pools of employees and access to capital goods. The provision of large tracts of land enabling factories and their support service providers to cluster together is a main pull factor for FDI as well. By locating industrial zones in less urbanised areas, the government can spread the benefits of industrialisation to many regions of the country. The effective implementation of the new industrial zones that have been planned at present will contribute significantly in this regard.

Although the literacy rate and education level of the average factory worker is higher in Sri Lanka than competitor nations, their technical competencies and innovative capacities needed for the production of complex products are lower. Therefore, technical and vocational training, as well as qualifications in science and engineering, should be offered to more students at the secondary and tertiary education levels together with industry exposure. Further, the social stigma against factory employees and the undesirable incentives in society for youth to seek public sector employment and turn away from the manufacturing sector need to be corrected.

The manufacturing sector development strategy should not be confused with a strategy to pick a few industries to promote for producing export goods. Though countries like South Korea succeeded in "picking winners", most of the countries which did so had to continue with protection for a long period of time. Such an approach should be avoided, as governments lack the capacity to predict high performing industries in the medium to long-term in the global markets, as well as to avoid rent seeking behaviour by firms. Therefore, government attention should be focused on providing wide-ranging support to the whole sector and for all present and future stakeholders through providing clear, consistent and broad based policies while ensuring an enabling private-sector-friendly environment. The manufacturing sector development strategy needs to be holistic and encompass all impacting aspects. The success of this strategy will be determined by the timely execution of the actions proposed.

The refined petroleum products subsector,

which solely reflects production in the refinery

of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC),

grew by 2.1 per cent during the year 2016. The

continued refinery process without any disruptions

during 2016 attributed to this growth as the refining

process was halted for several weeks in 2015 for

repairs and maintenance purposes. With the lifting

of the trade sanctions imposed by the USA on Iran

in January 2016, it is expected that the efficiency of

CPC’s refining process to increase in 2017, since

the CPC refinery is more suited for refining Iranian

light crude oil.

The output of the chemicals and chemical

products subsector declined by 12.4 per cent in

2016 largely due to lower fertiliser production.

The drought conditions that affected agricultural

activities during the second half of the year

combined with lower demand due to the revision

of the fertiliser subsidy scheme in early 2016 were

the main reasons for lower fertiliser production.

However, the increased output of paints and

varnishes subsector, driven by higher demand from

construction activities, contributed positively to the

growth in the chemicals and chemical products

subsector during the year.

The rubber and plastic products subsector,

which is the third largest subsector in FIPI,

indicated a healthy performance throughout

2016 in comparison to the previous year.

The subsector reported a growth of 5.4 per cent,

improving significantly from a contraction of 2.2 per

cent observed in 2015. Increased export demand

mainly from the USA, Germany, Brazil etc, for solid

tyres and air tyres contributed to this growth. The

countervailing duty that was imposed in 2016 on Sri

Lanka’s rubber exports to the USA is not expected

to cause a significant impact on export volumes,

as the current profit margins are adequate for the

industry to compete amidst countervailing duty being

imposed. The global demand for tyres is expected

to be driven by rising focus on fuel efficiency leading

to increased demand for ultra-fuel-efficient tyres.

As a result, an increase in investments in Research

and Development and innovation in tyre technology

is warranted. Nevertheless, the countervailing duty

may discourage new investors who are willing to

setup new tyre factories in Sri Lanka. Thus, there

remains a potential for local tyre manufactures

to capture these emerging market opportunities.

Manufacturing of rubber gloves also expanded

considerably with higher exports to markets in the

USA and Europe, thereby supporting the growth in

the rubber and plastic subsector.

The other non-metallic mineral products

subsector continued its growth momentum

during 2016 as well, reporting a growth rate of

11.1 per cent. The growth in production of cement,

driven by the higher demand in the construction

sector, was the key contributory factor towards this

performance. Further, manufacturing of roofing

sheets and clay tiles also expanded considerably

in 2016. Manufacturing of porcelain and other

ceramic products marginally increased during the

period under review with improved local as well as

overseas demand. However, the manufacturing

of glass products declined due to a temporary

reduction in capacity at the single factory producing

glass in Sri Lanka during a machinery upgrade.

Although the glass packaging industry, especially

in relation to food, beverages and pharmaceutical is

expected to continue the strong growth momentum

witnessed in recent years, the high energy costs

associated with production in this industry may

inhibit Sri Lanka’s ability to take advantage of

a growing demand in the domestic and global

markets.

The basic metals products subsector

exhibited a favourable growth during 2016

recording 28.7 per cent growth over 2015.

Higher demand from the construction sector led to

increased output in this subsector. The construction

industry is expected to continue its growth

momentum and thus, the basic metal subsector is

expected to grow in the future.

The fabricated metal products subsector,

which mainly comprises ship building and

repair activities, reported a contraction of

33.6 per cent. Decline in the offshore oil drilling

activities due to the drop in crude oil prices led to a

lower demand for oil drilling vessels. This may have

impacted the ship building operations during the

year. However, Sri Lanka has immense potential to

become the hub for ship manufacturing in the Asian

region due to its strategic location, highly trained

skilled workforce, and quality of workmanship.

The electrical equipment subsector declined

by about 9.3 per cent during 2016. The subdued

performance of this subsector was mainly due to

the drop in demand for transformers in key export

destinations such as Ethiopia, Uganda and Nepal.

The industry is highly diverse and manufactures a

wide range of high and low technology products.

However, given the high energy costs associated

with production, Sri Lanka’s exports face stiff

competition from China the global cost leader, and,

Taiwan and Vietnam. However, measures taken by

the industry to access new international markets

and diversify product segments are expected to

boost the industry in the future.

Industrial Policies and Institutional Support

The government, in line with its export-

oriented industrialisation strategy, continued

to support the growth and development of the

industrial sector through the implementation

of numerous policy initiatives with a view to

make Sri Lanka an export driven economic

hub of the region by enhancing its global

competitiveness to further integrate into the

global value chain. The Ministry of Industry

and Commerce continued to facilitate regional

industrialisation by promoting investments and

provisioning of infrastructure facilities, and

technical assistance at regional level. Accordingly,

the Ministry of Industry and Commerce continued

the infrastructure development activities in 32

industrial parks throughout the country in 18

districts. Majority of infrastructure development

activities relating to Trincomalee (Stage II) and

Batticaloa Industrial Estates was completed in

the provision of necessary infrastructure facilities.

The National Enterprise Development

Authority (NEDA) continued to facilitate

and support the development, growth and

competitiveness of Sri Lankan enterprises,

especially small and medium enterprises.

Activities of District and Regional Enterprise

Forums were further continued to create a proper

mechanism for providing business development

services to the entrepreneurs at District and

Divisional Secretariat level. NEDA continued

to provide technical training for selected SMEs

with the market linkage programme in order to

by conducting training programmes through the

Regional Enterprise Development Programme,

Women Entrepreneurship Development

Programme and “Upadhidari Vyavasayake

Technology Transfer Centre (ITTC) is expected to

be established as a joint project of the Wayamba

Makandura. The ITTC is expected to facilitate the

start-ups with required machineries and equipment

together with novel business ideas derived from

the research and development activities of WUSL,

research institutions and SMEs in the area.

The Export Development Board (EDB)

continued to organise trade exhibitions,

exporter forums, technical and financial

assistance programmes and trade delegations

with a view to enhancing the competitiveness of

domestic industrial products in the international

market, especially for apparel, jewellery, rubber

based products, footwear and leather products

etc. The EDB is currently working with a number of

international partners to identify new products and

new markets to promote Sri Lankan products in the

future.

A number of policy proposals introduced

in the Budget 2016 were implemented during

the year. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce

commenced initial work relating to establishing

a new industrial estate in Raigama to promote

regional industrialisation. Furthermore, to promote

the construction industry, the Construction Industry

Guarantee Fund Levy was removed during 2016

specifically with a view to encouraging small and

medium scale contractors. In addition, certain

initial steps were taken to set up an Innovation

Accelerator during 2017, a platform that will

combine the National Innovation Programmes of the

Coordinating Secretariat for Science Technology

and Innovation and the National Thematic Research

Programme and the technology support schemes

of the National Science Foundation.

The Budget 2017 included several policy

proposals to promote the industrial sector

contribution to the economy and the local value

addition. Skills and productivity development in the

Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) were the key

focuses of the budget proposals. To address the

skills shortages in several industries, a scholarship

programme is proposed with a view to provide the

necessary vocational training through the state

operated vocational training institutions. In addition,

a 3-month living stipend is proposed for 10,000

youth, while they are trained by the private sector

in apparel, healthcare, hospitality and construction

industries. SMEs in several identified industries are

to be provided with a credit guarantee scheme and

subsidised interest rates for business expansion.

To further enhance productivity of businesses,

2

75

a 75.0 per cent waiver on Ports and Airports

Development Levy (PAL) on high-tech automated

machinery and equipment imports is proposed.

It is also proposed to form a textile cluster that

includes sizing, dyeing and finishing units and the

Government is expected to support by providing

investment relief to businesses that will invest in

this venture and will also provide adequate space.

The removal of 25.0 per cent CESS applicable on

pre-fabricated structures is also proposed to further

boost the construction industry.

A number of proposals were included in the

Budget for 2017 to enhance the contribution

from the science, technology and innovations

towards enhancing productivity in the

industrial sector. The infusion of technology

into the industry sector leads to the manufacture

of high value added products resulting in higher

income levels. To this end, the Innovation

Accelerator Fund, which is aimed at supporting

commercialisation and last stage financing, was

further strengthened through allocation of funds to

continue its work. A Biotechnology Innovation Park,

which will provide facilities mainly for companies

engaged in the pharmaceutical industry and

genomics was proposed to be established on

a public-private partnership basis. The Centre

for Advanced Electronic Design, which supports

start-up companies in electronics, The Sri Lanka

Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC), the Centre

of Excellence in Robotics Applications (CERA)

were further strengthened through allocation of

funds. It was further proposed to support robotics,

cybernetics, electronics industries through tax

incentives. In March 2017, the approval of the Cabinet

of Ministers was given for the establishment of a

National Science Centre according to international

standards and a land of seven acres has already

been allocated at Pitipana, Homagama. To this

end, a Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee

for obtaining necessary consultation services, and

technological and financial assistance from suitable

agencies were also approved.

Whilst recognising the contribution of the

SME sector in the economy and one need

to enhance access of SMEs to finance, the

Budget 2017 included a proposal requesting

banks to allocate at least 10.0 per cent of their

loan portfolio to the SME sector. Accordingly,

in February 2017, the Central Bank requested all

licenced commercial banks to take appropriate

measures to implement the national policy

approved in the Budget 2017 to distribute credit

to various identified sectors. A concessionary

loan scheme was also proposed to support the

SMEs engage especially in agriculture, fisheries,

livestock, floriculture, horticulture, light engineering,

printing, tourism, handicrafts and apparel sectors.

Furthermore, a special loan scheme called

‘Swashakthi National Loan Scheme’ was launched

by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to help the SMEs

to start self-employments and industries.

Trade chambers and associations continued

to facilitate industrial sector development

through capacity building training programmes,

trade exhibitions and trade delegations. The

Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) in

partnership with Worldex Exhibition & Promotion

Pvt Ltd of Mumbai organised the ‘Intex South Asia

2016’, the only South Asian International Show

that focused on yarns, fabric, clothing accessories

and related services. This benefitted the industry

by offering new sourcing channels for fabric and

accessories. The JAAF also participated in a

Social and Labour Convergence Project initiated

by the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, to introduce

an internationally accepted tool of measurement

for social and labour compliance. In collaboration

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

76

with the Sri Lanka Export Development Board,

JAAF offered assistance to SME apparel

sector companies for the improvement of their

compliance standards. Further, in order to improve

the competitiveness of the industry, JAAF, in

association with the Sri Lanka Institute of Apparel

and Textile, facilitated the introduction of new

technologies to the Sri Lankan apparel industry.

In addition, trade associations such as the Ceylon

National Chamber of Industries, Federation of

Chambers of Commerce & Industry of Sri Lanka,

National Chamber of Commerce continued to

facilitate numerous trade delegations, training

programmes and trade forums to promote trade

and investment in the country.

Electricity, Water and Waste Treatment

The value added of electricity, water and

waste treatment activities grew by 10.0 per

cent in 2016 compared to 8.8 per cent growth

in 2015. Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning

supply activities, being the major contributor to

this category, grew by 8.4 per cent in 2016 in

comparison to 5.9 per cent growth recorded in

2015, in value added terms. This growth was

reflected in the increase in total electricity

generation which grew by 8.1 per cent during the

year compared to 5.9 per cent growth in 2015. Due

to the prolonged drought conditions that prevailed

for most part of the year, hydropower generation

contracted by 29.0 per cent in 2016 compared to

35.0 per cent growth in 2015. Meanwhile, fuel oil

based power generation increased substantially by

96.1 per cent in 2016 against 47.1 per cent decline

recorded in 2015 and coal based power generation

grew by 13.6 per cent in 2016 compared to 38.8

per cent growth recorded in 2015. Further, the

value added of water collection, treatment and

supply activities increased by 7.9 per cent in 2016

in comparison to 4.4 per cent growth recorded in

2015. The units of water distributed by the National

Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB)

recorded an increase of 12.0 per cent in 2016

compared to 5.7 per cent growth in 2015. The

total number of consumer accounts of NWS&DB

also increased by 7.1 per cent in 2016 compared

to 6.6 per cent growth recorded in 2015, reflecting

the continuous expansion in demand for water. In

the meantime, value added of sewerage, waste

treatment and disposal activities grew by 17.8 per

cent in value added terms in 2016 on top of the

substantial growth of 24.9 per cent recorded in

2015.

Construction

The value added of construction activities

rebounded during the year recording a

substantial growth of 14.9 per cent in 2016

recovering from 2.7 per cent contraction

recorded in 2015. Large scale construction

projects such as Colombo International Financial

City, extension of Southern Expressway, Phase

III of Colombo Outer Circular Highway project

and emerging condominium apartments largely

contributed to the expansion in construction

activities. This growth was reflected in the

significant increase in cement production and

its imports which collectively grew by 25.3 per

cent in 2016 compared to 5.8 per cent growth

recorded in 2015. Accordingly, both local

production of cement as well as imports of

cement increased substantially by 17.8 per

cent and 29.5 per cent, respectively, in 2016.

Meanwhile, investment goods and building

materials imports volume indices increased by

20.0 per cent and 22.9 per cent, respectively,

in 2016 indicating the positive developments

in construction activities. Furthermore, credit

granted by Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs)

to the private sector for construction activities

significantly increased by 26.9 per cent in 2016

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

on top of 36.1 per cent growth recorded in 2015.

Moreover, reflecting the development in housing

construction activities, the credit granted by LCBs

for personal housing construction activities also

increased by 27.1 per cent in 2016. Further, the

number of completed condominium units certified

by the Condominium Development Authority

increased by 24.5 per cent in 2016 recovering

from 29.5 per cent contraction in 2015. The

Central Bank observed this emerging trend in the

condominium market and commenced compiling

a monthly Condominium Property Price Index

for Colombo District to closely monitor the

sustainability of the latest developments in

construction activities.

Services

Services related economic activities which

collectively account for the major share

of GDP, expanded by 4.2 per cent in 2016

compared to 5.7 per cent growth in 2015, in

value added terms. Most of the services activities

contributed positively to the growth during 2016,

but at a slower pace compared to the previous

year. The recorded growth was largely supported

by the significant expansion in financial services

activities together with developments in the

transportation of goods and passengers including

warehousing activities. Further, the growth in

wholesale and retail trade, public administration,

real estate activities, education, other personal

services, insurance, accommodation services,

telecommunication, human health services, and

IT related activities contributed positively towards

expansion in Services activities. However,

professional services recorded a contraction

during the year. Reflecting the growth in Services

activities, the PMI for services activities compiled

by the Central Bank on monthly basis denoted an

expansion throughout the year. The sub-indices of

New Businesses, Business Activity, Employment

and Expectations for Activity expanded during

the year, while the Backlogs of Work sub-index

decreased. Further, the development in Services

activities was also portrayed in the behavior

of BOS sub-indices of the Services segment.

Accordingly, Business Condition, Demand and

Sales sub-indices, on average, remained above

the neutral level during the year.

Wholesale and Retail Trade

The wholesale and retail trade activities,

in value added terms grew by 2.5 per cent

in 2016 compared to 5.1 per cent growth

recorded in 2015. This slowdown was reflected

in the movements of import and export trade

volume indices. Further, the decline in agricultural

output and the slowdown in manufacturing output

hindered trade activities. The import volume index

increased by 7.9 per cent in 2016 compared to

10.6 per cent growth recorded in 2015. The

intermediate goods and investment goods imports

increased during the year, while the importation

of consumer goods contracted. Accordingly,

intermediate goods imports volume index recorded

a 10.8 per cent growth in 2016, mainly owing to the

increase in fuel, and textile and textile articles imports.

Further, investment goods imports volume index

continued to expand recording a 20.0 per cent growth

in 2016 compared to 13.6 per cent growth in 2015.

This growth was mainly buoyed by the substantial

increase in machinery and equipment, and building

materials imports, amidst the contraction in import

of transport equipment. However, consumer goods

imports volume index contracted substantially by

12.0 per cent in 2016 against 24.1 per cent growth

recorded in 2015, due to the decline in importation of

food and drinks, as well as other consumer goods.

Meanwhile, the exports volume index declined by 0.7

per cent in 2016 compared to 4.6 per cent growth

recorded in 2015 mainly driven by the contraction

in agricultural exports as well as the slowdown in

industrial exports.

Transportation and Storage

The value added of transportation of goods

and passengers including warehousing

activities grew by 4.1 per cent in 2016

compared to 5.0 per cent growth in 2015. In

this regard, a slowdown was observed in the

passenger kilometers operated by transport

services. The passenger kilometers operated by

the Sri Lanka Transport Board and the private

sector bus operators increased at a slower pace by

6.1 per cent and 2.0 per cent, respectively, in 2016

when compared to the respective growth rates

of 19.6 per cent and 6.1 per cent recorded in 2015.

The growth in passenger kilometers operated by

the Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) also slowed down

to 0.1 per cent in 2016 compared to 8.3 per

cent growth posted in 2015. However, the total

passenger kilometers flown by SriLankan Airlines

increased by 0.8 per cent in 2016 compared

to 0.2 per cent growth recorded in 2015. In

the meantime, container traffic (Twenty Foot

Equivalent Units - TEUs) and cargo handled by

Sri Lankan Ports increased by 10.6 per cent and

11.5 per cent, respectively, in 2016 in comparison

to respective growth rates of 5.7 per cent and

4.3 per cent recorded in 2015. Further, the freight

ton kilometers transported by SLR increased

by 7.6 per cent in 2016 recovering from 0.3 per

cent contraction recorded in 2015. Moreover, the

freight ton kilometers flown by SriLankan Airlines

increased by 5.0 per cent in 2016 compared to

7.5 per cent growth recorded in 2015. Meanwhile,

the value added of postal and courier activities

recovered during the year growing by 5.1 per

cent in 2016 from the contraction of 0.1 per cent

recorded in 2015. This recovery was reflected in

the increase in inland and foreign mails handled

by the Department of Posts during the year.

Accommodation and Food Service Activities

The value added of accommodation, food

and beverage service activities expanded by

4.0 per cent in 2016 compared to 1.9 per cent

growth in 2015. Considering tourism related

activities, the number of tourist arrivals increased

by 14.0 per cent in 2016, although at a slower

pace compared to 17.8 per cent growth in 2015.

Western Europe accounted for the highest number

of tourist arrivals as a region followed by South

Asia. When considering the country of residence,

India remained the prime tourist sourcing country,

while China was ranked second continuing their

contributions to the growth momentum in tourist

arrivals. Meanwhile, the room occupancy rate in

graded hotel establishments approved by the Sri

Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA)

increased to 74.8 per cent in 2016 in comparison

to 74.5 per cent in 2015. Further, the earnings from

tourism activities increased to US dollars 3.5 billion,

recording a growth of 18.0 per cent continuing its

expansion during the year. Increasing demand for

restaurants and hotels facilities which was reflected

by the increase in private consumption expenditure

also contributed to the growth in accommodation

and food services.

Information and Communication

The value added of information and

communication activities grew by 8.0 per cent

in 2016 compared to 10.9 per cent growth

recorded in 2015. The telecommunication

activities which grew by 8.3 per cent in 2016 on

top of 10.1 per cent growth recorded in 2015, in

value added terms, largely supported this growth

within the segment. Cellular subscribers and fixed

access wireline connections increased further in

contrast to continued contraction in fixed access

wireless connections during the period. Moreover,

internet and mobile broadband services increased

at a higher pace during the year. The value added of

IT programming consultancy and related activities

expanded by 7.1 per cent in 2016 compared to

14.8 per cent growth in 2015. Further, programming

and broadcasting and audio/video production

activities grew by 7.7 per cent in 2016 compared

to 4.4 per cent growth recorded in 2015, in value

added terms.

Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Activities including Ownership of Dwellings

The value added of financial, insurance

and real estate activities including ownership

of dwellings expanded by 8.4 per cent in 2016

compared to 13.3 per cent growth recorded

in 2015. All the economic activities within the

segment continued to grow during the year, yet at

a slower pace compared to 2015. The value added

in financial service activities and auxiliary financial

services grew at a healthy rate of 12.4 per cent in

2016 compared to 17.2 per cent growth recorded

in 2015, largely supporting this performance. The

gross loans and advances in banks and non-bank

financial institutions grew by 17.5 per cent and

20.1 per cent, respectively, in 2016 in comparison

to 21.1 per cent and 30.6 per cent, respectively, in

2015. In the meantime, the deposit base of banking

industry and non-bank financial institutions grew

by 16.5 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively, in

2016 compared to the growth of 15.3 per cent and

16.1 per cent, respectively, in 2015. As a result,

the total loans and deposit base of the banking

industry and non-bank financial institutions grew

by 17.0 per cent and 16.6 per cent, respectively, in

2016 compared to the respective growth of 17.9 per

cent and 24.9 per cent in 2015. The value added of

insurance, reinsurance and pension funding activities

expanded by 8.5 per cent in 2016 in comparison to

9.3 per cent growth recorded in 2015. This growth

was reflected in the premium earned plus claims

incurred by the insurance industry, which increased

by 15.1 per cent during 2016 compared to 16.6 per

cent growth recorded in 2015. Further, the value

added of real estate activities including ownership of

dwellings grew by 4.2 per cent in 2016 compared to

10.2 per cent growth recorded in 2015.

Professional Services and Other Personal Service Activities

The value added of professional services and

other personal service activities expanded by

0.7 per cent in 2016 in comparison to 1.8 per cent

growth in 2015. Other personal service activities,

the major contributor to the segment, which includes

personal services such as washing and cleaning

textiles, arts, entertainment and recreation, hair

dressing and other beauty treatment, and funeral and

related activities continued to expand during the year

by 1.3 per cent, albeit at a slower pace compared to

3.6 per cent growth recorded in 2015, in value added

terms. However, professional, scientific, technical,

administration and support service activities which

include services that require expert know-how,

such as architectural and engineering activities,

scientific research and development, advertising

and market research, legal services, and accounting

services contracted further in value added terms by

3.1 per cent in 2016 from 7.4 per cent contraction

recorded in the previous year.

Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the processes in which techniques and tools are employed to acquire and transform raw data consisting of statistical and non-statistical information for decision making purposes. Such BI is now in common possession of central banks around the world and is useful in the process of policy making for achieving broader objectives of central banking. In recent years, BI has also been used by central banks to guide the policy path in a more informed manner facilitating a forward looking data-driven decision making process. Besides such progress, advancements in information and communication technologies and innovations that were facilitated by the regulatory environment have propelled many changes in the global economic and financial landscape. The present-day world places an increasing premium on information of increasing depth and breadth, especially, as a consequence of the global financial crisis, whereby financial and economic analysts seek more qualitative data related to macroprudential aspects. In this backdrop, a new data paradigm called “Big Data” is emerging, associated with the combination of digital data from business transactions, social media, networked computers and the ‘Internet of Things’1. While Big Data denotes large volumes of data, BI specifies the tools and processes to engage with data to derive meaningful information leading to better decisions, greater efficiencies and goal accomplishments. In other words, BI helps find answers to questions, while Big Data is the library that allows to look for answers.

In view of the rapid pace of these developments, the quantity and quality of information currently available from the official sources alone may not be sufficient for more informed forward looking policy making and also lack time priority to focus on trends in the economy. Therefore, central banks globally are in search of Big Data and BI to fill this information gap. However, many challenges still exist in terms of depth and intensity of data and the information central banks acquire for the process of guiding their policy priorities.

New Data Paradigm: Big Data

Big Data is a description of large volumes of data, both structured and unstructured, that inundates policy making processes on a continuous basis. Information technology is turning out to be an integral part of everyday aspects of business and personal life, reflecting the proliferation of digital transformation. The digital economy is becoming increasingly intertwined with sectors such as media, banking (Fin-Tech2), retail

BOX 04Business Intelligence and Big Data: A New Dimension of Central Bank Statistics

transactions (e-commerce), energy, transportation and health (electronic records, digital health solutions) as well as entertainment and social interactions (social networks, online gaming, streaming services, etc.).

The data gathered from such sources, namely, Big Data has four main defining attributes: volume, variety, velocity and veracity.

• Volume – Big Data is considered to be large in volume, containing granular and micro-level information compared to traditional data.

• Variety – Apart from large volume, they are also highly complex and multidimensional from different data sources created by men and machines.

• Velocity – With the support of technological developments, they are supposed to be generated extremely fast in high frequencies and processed rapidly.

• Veracity – One of the important characteristics is the varying quality of data or data inconsistency due to many sources. Therefore, the test of veracity/ quality of the data is required. Further, accuracy and quality standards must be on par with or better than the conventional statistics. Transparency in coverage and methodology will help improve veracity.

Big Data for Economic and Price Stability

There are many advantages in exploiting “Big Data” in the form of vast quantities of digital information to gain fresh insights for the monitoring of economic activity and price levels. Moreover, the timeliness of Big Data could improve real-time decision making for monetary policy by providing early warning indicators and an instantaneous snap-shot of the economy whereas data from traditional or conservative data sources come with a lag.

An application of Big Data for monetary policy could be in the form of the construction of metrics that adapt quickly over time to calculate the daily inflation index from a continuously evolving basket. In addition, text mining techniques can be deployed to assess human instincts and emotions, referred by John Maynard Keynes as “animal spirits” that cannot be determined using economic equations and models. While many developments have taken place, the implementation of these methodologies is still a challenge and is evolving to appropriately suit central bank policy making. The application of Big Data does come with limitations and challenges, such as lack of easy access to the data, privacy concerns and methodological constraints in analysing data.

1. It is defined as the interconnection of computing devices embedded in everyday objects via the internet, enabling them to send and receive data. 2. Financial technology, also known as FinTech, is a line of business based on software to provide financial services. The term has expanded to include any technological innovation in the financial sector, including innovations in financial literacy and education, retail banking, investment and even crypto-currencies like Bitcoin.

Big Data for Financial System Stability

The importance of the timely financial sector information, which is necessary for financial system stability, has come under the spotlight since the global financial crisis and consequently, financial stability is now seen as a precondition for economic and price stability in many economies.

Central banks are well positioned to collect information on financial markets. Such information on newly emerging market practices and innovations can signal early warnings of any risks that may develop, which is another kind of BI gathering in financial markets. Additionally, innovations introduced by Fin-Tech products impact the payment and settlement systems of the economy. Therefore, the collection of high frequency financial sector information that covers a broad area helps the central bank to foresee the risks developing and identify inter-linkages among financial institutions, both domestically and abroad.

Based on a survey,3 conducted by the Bank for International Settlements in 2015, Big Data is perceived as a potentially effective tool in supporting macroeconomic and financial stability analyses. Most central banks surveyed expect a growing use of Big Data sources for macroeconomic and financial stability purposes, especially in the areas of economic forecasting, business cycle analysis and financial stability analysis (Chart B 4.1).

International Best Practices and Initiatives by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

In a move towards aligning with the changing paradigm of Big Data and high frequency indicators, the number of central banks that employ business surveys has

increased rapidly over the last decade. With an aim of gathering intelligence on the economy, these surveys go by many names, such as the Beige Book (Federal Reserve Bank), the Business Outlook Survey (Bank of Canada), the Bank of England’s Agents' Summary of Business Conditions, the Tankan Survey (Bank of Japan) and the Business Liaison Programme (Reserve Bank of Australia). These qualitative surveys try to capture the respondents’ views of various phenomena and their actions, given the prevailing conditions. Since the survey results are unique and context-specific, they are not revised in the future when new data becomes available as they measure the opinion of respondents at a specific point in time, giving more helpful guidance than early vintages of official data. Apart from that, these surveys also bring out people’s intentions, confidence and expectations that can validate the macro variables.

Central banks or the monetary authorities of these economies pay much attention to the information gathered through these surveys as they provide insights into the monetary policy decision making on current and expected developments which exert pressure on inflation and their monetary policy priorities. The information also provides alternative indicators that allow policy makers to monitor the gradual pass-through of policies to the economy. Overall, the information signals the turning points of business cycles and underlying reasons, and provides early warnings which are not easily captured through models. It also provides a deeper understanding of longer-term structural changes that are occurring within industries, and changes in the economic landscape.

In line with the international best practices, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) also established the following Business Surveys in recent years with an aim to connect with businesses and associations across industries of the economy. The Business Sentiment Indices developed through Business Outlook Survey and Purchasing Managers' Index Survey are published in the CBSL website for the information of the general public and the results of Credit Conditions Survey are used for internal analysis.

In January 2015 the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC) launched an online survey on central banks’ use of and interest in big data, with the collaboration of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) and the European Central Bank (ECB). The survey was answered by 69 IFC member central banks and monetary authorities worldwide, representing a response rate of 83 per cent.

The public administration, defence and

compulsory social security activities which

account for the largest share within the segment

expanded in value added terms by 5.2 per cent

in 2016 compared to 6.9 per cent growth in 2015,

mainly contributing to this growth. Meanwhile,

the value added of education services also

increased by 7.5 per cent in 2016 recovering

from 8.1 per cent contraction recorded in 2015.

Further, human health activities, residential care

and social work activities expanded by 1.5 per

cent in 2016 in comparison to 8.1 per cent growth

in 2015, in value added terms.

and investment expenditure amounted to

Rs. 12,742.8 billion in nominal terms in 2016

recording an 8.2 per cent growth compared to

5.2 per cent growth in 2015. This was mainly driven

by 19.6 per cent growth in investment expenditure

supported by 4.1 per cent growth in consumption

expenditure. In constant terms, the growth in GDE

was 6.2 per cent in 2016 compared to 6.3 per

cent in 2015. Expenditure on investment activities

the future. Therefore, the policymakers should be aware, take advantage of these developments and stay ahead of the curve for forward looking policy making. As such, BI gatherers at central banks should broaden the range of contacts in order to improve their understanding of the economy. The CBSL has initiated various projects in analysing such high frequency information in addition to the business surveys, which provide a rich collection of qualitative data, significantly in line with the central banks of developed countries.

These new information evolutions will need to be continuously assessed and BI must be broadly utilised for forecasting turning points in business cycles. Therefore, understanding the potential value and the limitations of the developments will ensure that the central bank is on the right path in facing the challenging

decision making landscape of the future. In the age of unprecedented volume, availability and access to data, the role of statisticians in central banks is changing; no longer representing a simple compiler of past and straightforward statistics, the role in the future will evolve to become an intelligence agent, a data analytic specialist or a data scientist with the ability to foresee any changes that may affect the economy in the future.

10.3 per cent and 10.1 per cent, respectively, in 2016

compared to 5.3 per cent and 3.5 per cent growth

recorded in 2015. With respect to constant prices,

exports contracted by 0.7 per cent during the year

against 7.9 per cent growth in imports, resulting

in a deterioration of net external demand in real

terms, as well. The terms of trade also increased by

3.7 per cent in 2016 compared to 2.7 per cent in 2015

indicating that the export prices remained relatively

higher than import prices. This trend was reflected

by the import and export indices. With regard to

imports, both value and volume indices increased.

However, export volume index contracted, while

value index increased. The growth in values and

volumes of imports was mainly driven by investment

expenditure (PCE), which accounts for 88.7

per cent of the total consumption expenditure,

grew by 4.3 per cent in 2016 compared to 10.0

per cent growth in 2015. The slowdown in PCE

was also reflected by the decline in consumer

goods import indices in both value and volume

terms. However, the volume decline in consumer

goods was significant compared to the decline in

value terms which reflects the impact of increase

in import prices related to consumer goods.

Further, on the domestic front, the increase in

government duties and levies partially contributed

to this slowdown in PCE. Meanwhile, government

consumption expenditure (GCE) grew by 3.1 per

cent in 2016 compared to 13.4 per cent growth

in 2015. Accordingly, individual final consumption

expenditure of the government on education and

health, and collective final consumption expenditure

of the government grew by 2.7 per cent and

3.3 per cent, respectively, in 2016 compared to the

respective growth rates of 22.6 per cent and 9.5 per

cent in 2015. This slowdown was mainly attributable

to the fiscal consolidation measures implemented

by the government during the year. Accordingly,

the recurrent expenditure of the government on

and intermediate goods imports on par with the

increase in investment, while consumption goods

imports contracted during the year. All major export

categories namely agricultural, industrial and

mineral export indices, grew in value terms during

2016. However, when considering volume terms,

agricultural exports recorded a contraction, while

industrial and mineral exports reported positive

performances. Accordingly, GDP at current market

prices, which is GDE adjusted to the net external

demand, registered a value of Rs. 11,839.0 billion

growing by 8.1 per cent with a real growth of

4.4 per cent and a GDP implicit deflator of 3.6 per

cent in 2016.

Consumption

Consumption expenditure increased in

nominal terms to Rs. 9,018.9 billion contributing

to around 76.2 per cent of the aggregate

expenditure and recording a 4.1 per cent growth

in 2016 compared to that of 10.3 per cent in

2015. This slowdown in consumption expenditure

was attributable to the decline in both private

and government consumption in 2016 compared

to 2015. Accordingly, private consumption

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

84

was partially attributable to the upward revisions

in government duties on alcoholic beverages, and

tobacco and narcotic products during the year.

The inflation of alcoholic beverages and tobacco

(NCPI, 2013=100) increased to 22.1 per cent in 2016

from 17.5 per cent in 2015, reflecting the increase in

respective price levels. Accordingly, the PCE share of

this category increased to 2.1 per cent in 2016 from

1.9 per cent in 2015.

PCE on clothing and footwear contracted by

17.7 per cent in 2016 compared to 7.7 per cent

growth in 2015. This moderation was reflected by

the slower growth of 0.4 per cent in the rupee value

import index of clothing and accessories in 2016

compared to 43.7 per cent growth recorded in 2015.

Further, the clothing and accessories import volume

index contracted by 13.7 per cent in 2016 compared

to 26.3 per cent growth in 2015. As a result, the PCE

share of this category declined to 3.0 per cent in 2016

from 3.9 per cent in 2015.

PCE on housing, water, electricity, gas and

other fuels category grew by 9.5 per cent in 2016

compared to 11.5 per cent growth in 2015.

salaries and wages grew only by 2.6 per cent in 2016

compared to 27.4 per cent growth in 2015, while the

other purchases of goods and services contracted by

19.5 per cent during the year compared to 64.9 per

cent growth in 2015, reflecting the decline in GCE.

PCE on food and non-alcoholic beverages

which makes the highest contribution to PCE,

grew by 5.1 per cent in 2016 compared to 18.4

per cent growth recorded in 2015. In rupee

terms, the food and beverages import index grew by

7.3 per cent in 2016 compared to 3.5 per cent growth

in 2015. However, the import volume index related

to this category contracted reflecting that the nominal

increase was driven by the higher prices. Meanwhile,

the food inflation of the National Consumer Price

Index (NCPI, 2013 = 100) increased at a slower pace

of 3.1 per cent during the year compared to 5.2 per

cent in 2015. The share of the food and non-alcoholic

beverages category in PCE was 27.9 per cent in 2016

compared to 27.7 per cent in 2015.

PCE on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and

narcotics grew by 16.7 per cent in 2016 compared

to 10.3 per cent growth in 2015. This increase

Electricity sales to the domestic sector grew by 8.3

per cent in 2016 compared to 10.1 per cent growth

in 2015, reflecting the continuous expansion in

electricity consumption of the household sector

in the country. Further, distribution of water units

to the domestic sector increased by 12.9 per cent

during the year compared to 7.1 per cent growth

in 2015. Meanwhile, the tariffs of electricity and

water, and prices of diesel and petrol remained

stable during the year, while the price of liquid

petroleum gas was revised downwards in

November 2016. The benign price pressure

on the items in this category was reflected by

0.1 per cent increase in inflation in the category

of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels

(NCPI, 2013=100) in 2016 compared to 4.2 per

cent increase recorded in 2015.

PCE on transport activities grew by 3.2 per

cent in 2016 compared to 7.6 per cent growth

in 2015. Registration of motor cars and motor

cycles which reflects PCE on transport related

goods recorded a significant contraction during

the year. However, passenger bus fares were

increased from August 2016, increasing the PCE

on transport.

The growth in PCE on health services

decelerated to 10.4 per cent in 2016 compared

to 22.1 per cent growth in 2015, while PCE on

education continued to contract by recording

an 1.8 per cent contraction in 2016 compared

to 0.3 per cent contraction recorded in previous

year. The setback in PCE observed in health and

education categories was partially owed to the impact

of the indirect taxes imposed during the year curtailing

demand. On the other hand, the downward revision

of prices related to selected pharmaceutical products

might have contributed to curtail health expenditure.

Health and education expenditure represented

3.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent of the PCE, respectively,

which are still at low levels, since the government

substantially involves in providing basic health and

education services for free of charge, reducing the

PCE on those categories. This was reflected by the

production approach estimates where the value

added of education and human health activities was

mainly generated by the government sector.

PCE on communication grew by 8.5 per cent

in 2016 when compared with 17.9 per cent growth

in 2015. The imposition of Value Added Tax (VAT)

on telecommunication services increased the unit

cost of this category dampening demand. Further, the

common floor rates of telecommunication services

were also revised upwards during the year. This was

reflected by 6.8 per cent increase in inflation of the

communication category (NCPI, 2013=100) in 2016

compared to 0.1 per cent increase in 2015. Moreover,

telephone and total internet connections slowed

down during the year growing by 6.6 per cent and

20.3 per cent, respectively, compared to 8.8 per cent

and 20.9 per cent growth, respectively, recorded in

2015. Further, import of telecommunication devices

also slowed down during the year as per rupee value

import index.

PCE on restaurants and hotels continuously

expanded by 8.0 per cent in 2016 compared to

1.7 per cent growth in 2015. This growth was

largely attributable to the changes in lifestyles with

conducive atmosphere and rapid growth in hotels,

cafes and restaurant facilities, proliferation of

global restaurant chains, as well as the increase in

tourist activities facilitating the continuous demand

for such activities.

GCE which includes the collective final

consumption expenditure and the individual final

consumption of the government slowed down

during the year in line with fiscal consolidation

measures implemented by the government.

Collective final consumption expenditure, the major

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

86

GCE category, accounted for 67.7 per cent of the

GCE in 2016. This represents the expenditure

incurred by the government for the benefit of the

community as a whole, which includes expenditure

on general public services, defence, public order

and safety, economic affairs, environmental

protection, housing and community amenities,

recreation, culture and religion, and social

protection. Accordingly, the government collective

final consumption expenditure grew by 3.3 per

cent in nominal terms in 2016 compared to 9.5

per cent growth recorded in 2015. This slowdown

was mainly due to 9.0 per cent contraction in the

expenditure on defence during the year against

4.2 per cent growth in 2015. Meanwhile, individual

final consumption expenditure of the government

which is the expenditure incurred for the benefit

of individual households on education and health

also slowed down to 2.7 per cent in 2016 compared

to 22.6 per cent growth in 2015. Considering the

disaggregated data, expenditure on education

and health grew by 1.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent,

respectively, in 2016 compared to 28.4 per cent

and 16.1 per cent growth, respectively, recorded

in 2015.

Investment

Investment expenditure recovered during

2016 recording a healthy growth rate of

19.6 per cent in nominal terms against the

contraction of 7.0 per cent recorded during

2015. The expenditure on construction activities

rebounded during 2016 recording a significant

growth rate of 18.0 per cent, recovering from the

marginal contraction of 0.2 per cent recorded in

2015 contributing substantially to the growth in

investment. Large scale investment projects of the

government as well as private sector involvement

in investments, reflected by the significant growth

in credit granted by Licensed Commercial Banks

(LCBs) to the private sector for construction

activities, largely contributed to this growth. This

was further indicated by the significant growth in

imports of building materials which were used for

construction activities. Further, the expenditure

on machinery and equipment, and weapons

systems, grew by 7.3 per cent in 2016 compared

to 2.0 per cent growth in 2015. This was also

reflected by the significant growth recorded in

the imports of machinery and equipment, both in

value and volume terms during the year. Further,

investment on transport equipment, information

and communication technology equipment,

and intellectual property products positively

contributed to the observed growth in investment

activities, while investment on cultivated

biological resources contracted during 2016.

Moreover, change in inventories and acquisition

less disposals of valuables significantly grew by

121.8 per cent in 2016 recovering from 56.1 per

cent contraction recorded in 2015, supporting the

investment growth.

Inflows of Foreign Direct Investment

(FDI) to companies registered under the

Board of Investment (BOI), including loans,

amounted to US dollars 801 million in 2016

as compared to US dollars 969.7 million in

2015, reflecting a year-on-year decline of

around 17.4 per cent. The main reason for

the contraction in FDI inflows during the period

was the decrease in inflows to infrastructure

projects, services and manufacturing by 25.1 per

cent, 17.0 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively.

Majority of FDI during the period was on account

of infrastructure sector representing 42.4 per

cent of FDI (US dollars 339.5 million). FDI in the

manufacturing sector represented 30.9 per cent

of total FDI inflows (US dollars 247.7 million),

whereas FDI in the services sector amounted

to US dollars 211.9 million representing around

26.5 per cent of total FDI inflows during 2016.

Total estimated investments of projects

approved in 2016 under Sections 16 and 17 of

the BOI Act are estimated at Rs. 1,357.4 billion.

Investment value of project approvals in the

services, chemicals, petroleum, coal, rubber

and plastics, non-metallic and mineral products

sectors increased compared to 2015. However,

estimated investment inflows into projects approved

in food, beverages and tobacco, textile, wearing

apparel and leather, fabricated metal, machinery

and transport equipment sectors recorded a lower

investment value compared to the last year. The

estimated investment value of projects contracted

under section 17 was Rs. 754.8 billion, which

was an increase of 160.9 per cent compared with

2015. Estimated investments of projects which

commenced commercial operations under sections

17 and 16 of the BOI Act were Rs. 4,687.6 billion as

at end 2016. The cumulative realised investment of

the BOI by end 2016 was Rs. 2,179.8 billion.

Availability and Utilisation of Resources

The amount of resources available in the

economy grew by 8.6 per cent in 2016 compared

to 5.2 per cent growth recorded during 2015

registering a value of Rs. 15,281.5 billion in

nominal terms. Considering the disaggregated

data, both GDP and external resources increased

in nominal terms during the year in comparison

to 2015. Increase in prices as reflected by the

increase in GDP deflator contributed to the nominal

growth in domestic resources. Growth in domestic

resources was driven by Industry and Services

activities, while Agricultural resources declined

during the year. In terms of external resources, the

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

increase in imports in nominal terms was partially

attributable to the increase in import prices due to

the depreciation of the local currency. However, in

real terms, the growth in total resource availability

slowed down to 5.2 per cent in 2016 compared to

6.1 per cent growth in 2015 mainly due to the slow

growth in GDP as well as in external resources in

real terms.

Majority of the available resources were

used for consumption purposes accounting for

59.0 per cent of the total resources in 2016,

which was a decline compared to 61.5 per cent

in 2015 owing to the slowdown in consumption

growth. The share of resources utilised for

investment purposes improved to 24.4 per cent in

2016 as compared to 22.1 per cent in 2015. This was

mainly attributable to the 12.3 per cent growth in gross

domestic fixed capital formation in 2016 compared to

1.1 per cent growth in 2015, increasing the share to

21.4 per cent of the total resources utilised during the

year. Meanwhile, exports share as a percentage of total

resource utilisation improved slightly to 16.6 per cent in

2016 compared to 16.3 per cent share recorded in 2015,

with an increase in exports in nominal terms due to the

relatively higher export prices. In real terms, resource

utilisation declined due to the slowdown in consumption

and the contraction in exports.

Savings

Domestic savings of the economy recorded

a significant growth of 23.2 per cent in 2016 and

reached Rs. 2,820.1 billion against 8.8 per cent

contraction recorded in 2015. This improvement

in domestic savings recorded during 2016 was

driven by the healthy growth observed in private

savings together with the significant decline in

government dis-savings as a combined outcome

of increase in government revenue and slowdown

in government recurrent expenditure compared

to 2015 following concerted efforts towards fiscal

consolidation. As a result, domestic savings as a

percentage of GDP increased to 23.8 per cent in

2016 compared to 20.9 per cent in 2015.

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

89

National savings of the economy grew by

20.2 per cent in 2016 registering Rs. 3,427.1

billion against 7.7 per cent contraction observed

in 2015. This recovery was mainly attributable to

the significant growth in domestic savings. Further,

net current transfers from the rest of the world

grew by 11.6 per cent during the year, contributing

positively to national savings. Meanwhile, net

primary income from the rest of the world further

contracted during the year albeit at a slower pace

compared to the previous year. Accordingly, national

savings as a percentage of GDP improved to

28.9 per cent in 2016 compared to 26.0 per cent

recorded in 2015. However, as a result of the higher

growth in investment expenditure, national savings-

investment gap increased marginally to 2.5 per cent

of GDP in 2016 compared to 2.4 per cent of GDP in

2015.

2.6 Income

The disaggregated components that

generated income within the economy during

the year are illustrated through the income

approach. The Gross Operating Surplus

(GOS), the major income source accounted for

69.0 per cent, followed by the Compensation of the

Employees (CE), and the taxes less subsidies on

production which accounted for 30.6 per cent and

0.4 per cent, respectively, of the total gross value

added of the economy in 2016. The GOS grew by

6.5 per cent in nominal terms in 2016 compared

to 2.8 per cent growth observed during 2015. This

increase was mainly attributable to the increase

in Net Operating Surplus (NOS), the main income

category in the GOS which grew by 7.3 per cent in

2016 as compared to 2.0 per cent growth in 2015.
