    "text": "Sri Lanka has achieved substantial economic and social progress since the economic liberalisation in 1978, in terms of national wealth and improved living standards. However, economic growth in the last few years has been constrained at around 3.0 to 5.0 per cent levels, while exports relative to GDP have declined. The contribution of the manufacturing sector to economic growth has remained low during the last two decades, due to the inability to remain competitive in both domestic and foreign markets, and evolve towards producing high value added products while increasing productivity. The accelerated development achieved by many other nations, through the implementation of strong industrialisation policies during the mid 20th century, demonstrates that the manufacturing sector of a country can play a major catalytic role in a country\u2019s economic and social transformation process. The development of the manufacturing sector can contribute to the eradication of poverty and regional disparity, create quality employment opportunities, increase export income, as well as develop technological capabilities and productive capacities of the economy to support growth. Therefore, at this juncture of Sri Lanka\u2019s growth path, where reliance on foreign aid and government welfare transfers cannot be sustained any longer, there is a crucial need to revitalise the manufacturing sector, for the economy to attain accelerated sustainable growth.",

The share of the manufacturing sector in GDP remained low and stagnated since 1978 (Table B 3.1), while growth rates of the manufacturing sector remained below GDP growth rates throughout most of the last 15 years (Chart B 3.1). Consequently, the GDP growth rates that Sri Lanka recorded during the last few years emanated mainly from non-tradable services and construction, constraining growth to 3.0 to 5.0 per cent levels, which is inevitable given the limited size of the domestic economy.",

During the boom of the apparel manufacturing era, Sri Lanka failed to effectively strategise on diversification into other product categories or for shifting manufacturing to more technologically intensive, high value-added and complex products. Sri Lanka's development pattern corresponds to a concept referred to as \u201cpremature deindustrialisation\u201d in academic literature. This is shown to be caused by globalisation forces, which force growth in countries with open economies and a lack of a \u201chead-start\u201d in industrialisation, to be based on capital inflows, foreign aid, remittances and commodity price booms, making only moderate growth possible through a services-based economy.2 This further highlights that Sri Lanka needs to undertake an urgent commitment to develop the manufacturing sector and integrate into global value chains even as a late-entrant, in order to accelerate growth.",

At present, lower-middle income nations such as Vietnam and the Philippines are striving to follow a similar growth path through industrialisation.

These initiatives, together with all other plans to develop infrastructure, promote research and development, upgrade skills of the human resources, and establish new small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are to be implemented by various government agencies, will help attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and increase manufacturing. Meanwhile, having recognised the importance of policy support for development, the Government has also put in place an overall development strategy and is formulating trade and export related policies. However, there still remains a need for a comprehensive manufacturing sector development strategy, which aligns various government efforts to increase manufacturing activities with the government\u2019s overall development agenda, and provides due prominence to the whole manufacturing sector while addressing its structural issues.",

This manufacturing sector strategy needs to be a part of Sri Lanka\u2019s overall development strategy. The trade policy and export strategies should be a part of the attempts to industrialise through a manufacturing sector development strategy such that the development process will spur international trade. This is essential for the country to achieve a higher trajectory of growth and development. Furthermore, this strategy must encompass the interplay between the manufacturing sector with the agriculture and service sectors as well. Importantly, productivity enhancement in the agriculture sector will not only transfer under-utilised labour to the manufacturing sector, but also reduce the share of income spent on food. The resultant increase in real income spendable on other goods will increase the demand within the economy for manufactured products.",

The FDI flows occur due to push and pull factors relating to the source country and the recipient country, respectively. In general, pull factors include low cost labour, raw material, access to markets, competitive exchange rates, low tax regimes, availability of land for setting up factories etc. Factors that create a conducive environment for FDI include political stability, consistent support by public institutions, sound macroeconomic and legal frameworks, efficient logistics, minimum trade barriers, agglomeration economies and low-cost and highly efficient human resources. Since global value chain producers need to transport product components from one location to another expeditiously and with low transaction costs, efficiency of road and sea transport, access to ports, speed of customs clearance, warehousing and the existence of minimum tariff and non-tariff barriers are critical. In the past, firms in advanced nations invested in developing nations seeking cheap labour and natural resources (North-South FDI). However, during the last decade, South-South FDI, which involve emerging market economies (EMEs) such as China, Malaysia, India and Russia, investing in similar economies has increased. Such countries are more focused on market access and raw materials and have different perceptions about the quality of institutions than firms of advanced nations.

Data on capacity utilisation in factory industries compiled by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka indicate that not more than 83.0 per cent of installed capacity were utilised from 2011 to 2016. Meanwhile, economic value added in the industrial sector as well as the agricultural sector, in terms of the proportion of the labour force employed gradually declined from 1981 to 2016. This suggests that an increasing proportion of the workforce was used to generate a declining proportion of the total value added of the country.

    "text": "Meanwhile, there is a prevalence of a large number of small firms, which neither grow nor exit for a long period of time in Sri Lanka. This results in labour and other resources being locked in less productive activities, as suggested by a World Bank study.5 Small enterprises that do not grow, do not contribute to long term productivity enhancement of the country, as they do not engage in product or process innovation or provide quality employment opportunities. This study estimates that firms with less than 19 workers make up 76.0 per cent of enterprises in Sri Lanka which is a much higher percentage compared to India, China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines and Vietnam. Further, firms aged 25 years or more are only 50.0 to 90.0 per cent larger than firms aged 5 years or less. Larger firms tend to be more productive due to economies of scale, access to finance, ability to attract better quality managers, maintenance of better networks of market access and better record-keeping etc. Therefore, it is important to remove barriers for small and medium scale enterprises to grow by improving access to finance, increasing project-feasibility based lending rather than physical collateral-based lending, modernising labour regulations that hinder termination of employment, upgrade poor accounting and record-keeping, rationalising taxes that deter firms from expanding operations etc. Strong collaboration needs to be built between research and development (R&D) institutions and SMEs such that product development needs of SMEs are identified by the R&D institutions, while their findings are used by the SMEs. R&D institutions need to explore avenues to utilise minerals, herbs and other natural resources in Sri Lanka to increase manufactured exports of domestic industrialists. At present, a lot of such resources are exported in raw or low value-added forms at present. Fostering small enterprises until they grow into large enterprises and protecting them from dumping (by cheap imports) are necessary to uplift domestic manufacturing and gear the sector towards exports. In this connection,",

However, a healthy level of competition needs to be encouraged within industries, and bankruptcy and employment termination regulations need to allow efficient reallocation of resources from firms that restructure or exit to more productive uses. In addition, the proposed trade adjustment package is an important complement to the economic partnership agreements which are being negotiated. It should be well-designed to increase the competitiveness of domestic firms and provide retraining for workers affected by trade liberalisation.",

    "text": "The manufacturing sector development policy should promote cluster based industrial policies and enhance opportunities for agglomeration economies. This is achieved by encouraging similar manufacturers to locate geographically close to each other and their support service providers to cluster around them. In such a context, the government can provide the necessary infrastructure, fiscal incentives and facilities for employees in a more focused manner, while firms can gain through economies of scale in inputs, interaction with each-other, larger pools of employees and access to capital goods. The provision of large tracts of land enabling factories and their support service providers to cluster together is a main pull factor for FDI as well. By locating industrial zones in less urbanised areas, the government can spread the benefits of industrialisation to many regions of the country. The effective implementation of the new industrial zones that have been planned at present will contribute significantly in this regard.",

Though countries like South Korea succeeded in \"picking winners\", most of the countries which did so had to continue with protection for a long period of time. Such an approach should be avoided, as governments lack the capacity to predict high performing industries in the medium to long-term in the global markets, as well as to avoid rent seeking behaviour by firms. Therefore, government attention should be focused on providing wide-ranging support to the whole sector and for all present and future stakeholders through providing clear, consistent and broad based policies while ensuring an enabling private-sector-friendly environment. The manufacturing sector development strategy needs to be holistic and encompass all impacting aspects. The success of this strategy will be determined by the timely execution of the actions proposed.",

Such BI is now in common possession of central banks around the world and is useful in the process of policy making for achieving broader objectives of central banking. In recent years, BI has also been used by central banks to guide the policy path in a more informed manner facilitating a forward looking data-driven decision making process. Besides such progress, advancements in information and communication technologies and innovations that were facilitated by the regulatory environment have propelled many changes in the global economic and financial landscape. The present-day world places an increasing premium on information of increasing depth and breadth, especially, as a consequence of the global financial crisis, whereby financial and economic analysts seek more qualitative data related to macroprudential aspects. In this backdrop, a new data paradigm called \u201cBig Data\u201d is emerging, associated with the combination of digital data from business transactions, social media, networked computers and the \u2018Internet of Things\u20191. While Big Data denotes large volumes of data, BI specifies the tools and processes to engage with data to derive meaningful information leading to better decisions, greater efficiencies and goal accomplishments. In other words, BI helps find answers to questions, while Big Data is the library that allows to look for answers.",
