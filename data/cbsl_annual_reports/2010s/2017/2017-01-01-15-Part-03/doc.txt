All government agencies should invite offers for cost of goods (FOB terms or any other similar INCO terms excluding freight) and freight (C & F terms or any other similar INCO terms) separately when calling tenders. It would then be possible for those government agencies to take up with the CSCL to negotiate the best terms for shipping goods and to consider whether it would be cheaper on the overall to import on ‘freight payable at destination basis’ (FOB terms or any other similar INCO terms for payment of freight at destination) through CSCL. It is therefore imperative that CSCL be consulted before a final award is made. If carriage through CSCL is favorable a clause should be inserted in the letter of credit and sale contract that ‘cargo should be shipped on a vessel of CSCL or a vessel nominated by CSCL under CSCL Bill of Landing on freight payable at destination basis’.

3. All departments and purchasing institutions should submit one copy of the Proforma Invoice indicating freight to CSCL before placing the order/opening L/C with the following information to obtain the written confirmation from CSCL that it could accept carriage on “freight payable at destination basis” at competitive freight rates or at most without exceeding the rates of the suppliers freight quotation. If CSCL freight is higher than the suppliers quotation a written waiver should be obtained from CSCL enabling to entrust the suppliers to arrange shipment according to their quotation on freight pre-paid basis.

4. All government agencies should submit one copy of the purchase order to the CSCL within one week of placing the order with the following information.

a. Nature of cargo:b. Approximate quantity of cargo in tons/ cubic meters/ number of packages and measurements of packages:c. FOB value:d. Full particulars of the supplier and the probable part of shipment:e. The approximate delivery dates:

5. At present the CSCL provides regular liner services from all over the world. Contact details of the CSCL agents could be obtained from the CSCL web site www.cscl.lk or from the corporations’ liner department on Tele./ Fax No.2325744/ 2449486.

6. All government agencies should ensure that the suppliers of their cargo are requested to contact these agents in order to arrange shipments under CSCL Bill of Landing once freight is agreed with CSCL.

7. No commercial bank shall open L/C for imports by any government institutions without stipulating that the cargo must be carried under CSCL Bill of Landing unless a letter of waiver signed by the liner manager of CSCL is enclosed to the documents forwarded to open L/C or any other type of import payment documents.

To : All Participants of LankaSettle System

Recording of Ownership of Government Securities in the LankaSecure Central Depository System

As per LankaSettle System Rules, all LankaSettle Dealer Direct Participants (DDPs) shall act as custodians for their customers to execute transactions through relevant accounts in the LankaSecure. Hence, LankaSettle DDPs shall maintain accounts in respect of each of its customers to hold scripless Government Securities (GS) to which each such customer has title, and record the interests of each such customer in scripless GS. Also, in terms of the custodial responsibility, LankaSettle DDPs are required to promptly and accurately record details of each customer in LankaSecure Central Depository System (CDS) when the customer obtains legal ownership of scripless GS, or any change of ownership or owner details of scripless GS.

However, it has been observed that many LankaSettle DDPs fail to perform their custodial role in compliance with the above rules and regulations relevant to scripless GS in the conduct of their business. The improper recording of scripless GS balances in LankaSecure CDS has led to many enquiries by customers and audit firms from the Public Debt Department, for interpretation of account types under which such balances are indicated in the relevant LankaSecure statements.

Part III

The LankaSecure statements issued after March 2016 will indicate the narrations of new account types as given on pages 7 to 10 of Volume 3 of LankaSettle System Rules.

Part III - 62

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2016

of Finance on 04.12.2015, it was decided to re-start the microfinance loan component for disbursement of micro loans through the licensed banks. As already communicated to you, your bank has been designated as a Participating Financial Institution (PFI) of this project. Accordingly, Rs. 90 mn has been allocated for disbursement by end March 2016 as per the terms and conditions laid down in this Operating Instructions. Depending on the progress a further allocation will be made with the concurrence of the funding agency.

The purpose of this programme is to reach the poor communities to help improve their livelihood. The focus group will include women, landless households and other marginalized groups. The programme would provide micro credit for income generating activities (IGAs), such as self-employment in agribusiness, agriculture, fisheries, livestock, trade and services, and small industries.

2) The Strategy of Micro Financing

The microfinance programmes are mainly targeted for women to create significant contribution to the livelihood improvements of the family along with the enhancement of gender equity and empowerment of women. Therefore, the recipients of the credit would be the Self Help Groups (SHGs), preferably led by women and the majority of the members would be women. Therefore, the first step would be the formation of SHGs. Then the SHGs would formulate IGAs for the group or for individuals. SHGs with mutual support are expected to implement the IGAs through credit supported by the programme. The process is facilitated by the PFI, by adopting innovative interventions to make the process effective and efficient.

3) Objectives

a. To improve income level and social conditions of the poor in selected project areasb. To enhance financial inclusion among the poor by providing credit in the absence of formal collateral for income generating activitiesc. To create income generating opportunities among the poor and enhance the skills and capacities of the beneficiariesd. To establish cost effective and sustainable micro credit delivery system designed for the poore. To encourage rural women to participate in income generating activitiesf. To inculcate savings habits and thrift among the rural poorg To improve vocational, entrepreneurial and financial skills of the poorh. To build up self confidence among the rural poor and reduce their dependency through social mobilization processi. To encourage governmental and nongovernmental organizations in the project areas to serve the target group of the project

4) Strategiesa. Identification of target beneficiariesb. Formation of beneficiaries into SHGsc. Collection of information for baseline survey to evaluate the impact of credit deliveryd. Linking SHGs to banking/financial systeme. Promotion of savings among beneficiariesf. Provision of skills training and other support servicesg. Provision of group guarantee as collateral for loansh. Strengthening of group based development societies and link them with the PFIi. Progress monitoring of IGAs.

5) Project Area

The programme will be implemented throughout the country.

PFIs are required to avoid any overlapping with Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Programme (PAMP) implemented by them.

6) Credit Facility

Under NADeP, short and medium term credit or group loans will be made available to eligible individuals in Self Help Groups SHGs or groups of individuals within SHGs for IGAs through the PFI. The PFI will be responsible for disbursement of loans for viable projects, supervising the performance of such projects and recovery of loans granted. In the process of loan disbursement, the PFI is responsible for identification of beneficiaries, formation of groups, beneficiary training and capacity building, savings mobilization and finally granting of loans. The beneficiaries will play an important role in loan supervision and recovery through peer pressure and group responsibilities.

7) Eligible Activities

a) Beneficiaries are from landless / near landless householdsb) Members of households who formed themselves as SHGs under the programmec) Households who are not defaulters of any other financial institution

11) Basic Principles of Group Formation and Operations

a) All benefits under the programme should flow to the designated target groups within the programme area. A group should be a gathering of 5 to 8 members of different households/families and not a group from the same family,b) Granting of loans under the Programme should be made only after the confirmation of viability of the group/project through social mobilization, training and capacity development and savings operation over a period of at least three (03) months. However, it is not expected PFIs to form new groups for the delivery of the initial allocation of Rs. 90 MN of microcredit. Beneficiaries need to be selected from the existing and matured groups. New groups can be formed if and when the programme allocation is increased after March 2016. Similarly, recruitment of Social Mobilizers to achieve this target is not recommended but PFIs may use their existing field networks for the implementation,c) Homogeneous groups should be formed in terms of economic status. In order to ensure homogeneity, persons who are in the same income category with similar aspirations and expectations would be desired,d) The members of a group should be residents in close proximity enabling them to meet easily for group activities and interactions,e) Attention should be paid on previous defaults by potential members. The defaulter of any of the financial obligation should not be eligible for granting of loans until they settle their obligations.

12) Group Operations

a. Each Group should have a Leader and a Secretary,b. Groups are required to meet once a week at a convenient place in the village. SM who is responsible for the organization of the group should be present at these meetings.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016

Part III

Part III - 64

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2016

c. Members of a group must decide how much to save at weekly intervals. The group should endeavour to collect the savings at the weekly meetings. The amount of saving decided by the group should be an equal amount for all the members in the group. The group must decide the order in which the group members should borrow from the PFI,d. The group is required to assist the PFIs in loan collection and exercise various other forms of self discipline such as coming to the group meetings on time,e. If members of a group wish to borrow a loan as a group the PFIs can grant loans depending on the viability of the income generating activities,f. Two or more persons within a group may borrow jointly for a single project.

13) Savings Mobilization

Mobilization of savings is an important function of the Programme, as beneficiary savings are an integral part of the group formation and credit provision. In order to be eligible for loans from the Programme, beneficiaries are required to undertake savings. Savings effort promoted through the Programme will help to inculcate the savings habit among group members and cement further cohesiveness for contributing towards social and economic security of beneficiaries

a. After a formation of a group, the first task of the group would be to engage in savings. Members of the group must decide how much to save at weekly intervals. Once the amount is determined, the group should endeavour to collect savings from members at the weekly meetings and deposit in a Group Savings Account at the PFI.b. The group will be subject to the terms and conditions that control the personal savings in the group savings fund. An individual member, without the consent of all the other members of the group, cannot withdraw the funds in the Group Savings Account.c. When a member receives a loan from the PFI, savings in the Group Savings Account will automatically be taken as collateral/security and the funds will not be released until such loan/loans are settled in full. However, interest at prevailing market rates will be added to the balance that remained in the Savings Account and will remain the property of the group.d. The Group leader and the Secretary will operate the Group Savings Account while the management of the Group Fund will be done by the entire group. All withdrawals from the Group Savings Account should receive the consent of all the members of the group.e. The Group leader should present the group savings pass book issued by the PFI at each and every group meeting in order to enable the members to verify the balances of their collection/savings.

Any change of membership in the group should be informed to the PFI by the Group leader/Secretary, and necessary changes could be made in the ledgers/mandates etc. with the consent of all remaining members of the group

14) Group Member Training

a. Beneficiary training (hard and soft skills) will be provided under the provisions of the Programme’s Youth Training sub-component,

b. These training sessions will be organized by PFIs with the help of SMs depending on the factors such as number of participants intended to be trained in each program from different geographical areas,

c. The training will be free of charge to beneficiaries and full cost will be borne by the PMU.

15) Eligibility of Loans

The group should have been in existence for a minimum period of three months prior to obtaining a loan and the group members should have been engaged in regular savings and group activities/home gardening programmes etc. during this three month period.

16) Size of the Individual Loan

Individual beneficiaries would be eligible for loans for IGAs ranging from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 300,000. The objective is to include the people who are below the poverty level and to assist the group still vulnerable to shocks even their income is above the poverty level.

17) Grace Period

If necessary, depending on the nature of economic activity, the PFIs may grant a grace period to borrowers. Maximum duration of the grace period is six months. The borrower is liable to pay interest during the grace period.

18) Interest Rates

CBSL will lend the proceeds of the loan from IFAD at 3.25 Per cent per annum to PFIs and the PFIs are required to lend to end borrowers at 6.50 per cent per annum.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2016

Part III - 65

19) Repayment Terms and the Period

Agricultural loans for short term crops (seasonal crops) should be paid back within short term duration of less than 9 months. Loan repayment period of other loans will not exceed 36 months. The PFIs may fix flexible repayment schedules for working capital loans based on the enterprise’s projected cash flows.

20) Security

In principle physical collateral is not required. The compulsory group savings before receiving credit (at least for three months) could be taken as security.

21) Accounts and Financial Statements

a. PFIs should maintain appropriate accounts and records to indicate inter alia, sub loan appraisal, approvals, disbursement and recovery.

b. PFIs are required to maintain separate accounts for the utilization of loan proceeds and refinance operations.

c. PFIs should make available the Accounts and Financial Statements for the inspection and review of RDD and IFAD. Further, the PFI should submit the Accounts and Financial Statements to RDD and IFAD when required.

22) Registration of Borrowers

PFIs should submit the details of the loan applicants to the Regional Development Department of the Central Bank as per the Loan Registration Form given as Annex A of the Operating Instructions.

23) Refinance Procedure

Central Bank of Sri Lanka will provide 100 per cent refinance for all loans granted under the scheme subject to the terms and conditions laid down in this Operating Instructions.

a) Duly completed application for refinance should be submitted by the Head Offices of the PFIs to RDD for reimbursement after releasing loans by their branch offices. Each refinance application should be accompanied with the following documents:

a.1 Application for Refinancea.2 Statement of Loan Disbursementsa.3 Demand Promissory Note with relevant Stamp Duty

a.4 Delivery Note

a.5 Form of Assignment by way of Pledge to CBSL

a.6 Disbursement Letter

b) Upon approval of the refinance application, RDD will sanction the refinance application and release refinance on first come first served basis

c) Refinance claims should be submitted to RDD through the PFIs/Head Office within 1month of the date of disbursement

d) RDD undertakes to ensure that refinance payment is made within 01 week of receipt of the completed refinance application

e) Capital and interest payments on refinance loan will be payable by the PFIs to the CBSL according to the Repayment schedule for refinance prepared by the CBSL

24) Repayment of Sub-Loans

a. The borrower should repay the loan instalments directly to the relevant PFI.

b. SMs/Field Officers appointed by PFI are empowered to collect repayments/deposits at the weekly meetings of the group issuing an acknowledgement receipt. Such funds should be deposited in the respective Savings Account maintained at the PFI branch immediately after collection by the SMs/Field Officers attached to the PFI.

25) Action for Defaulters

Loan defaulters could be classified into two broad categories:

a) Wilful defaulters

b) Non-wilful defaulters.

This classification should be made on the basis of information available to the Branch Manager of PFI through the SMs, Field Officers, Group leaders/Society leaders etc.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2016

Part III

Part III - 66

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2016

a) Wilful Defaulters

If the information available indicates that a borrower has had a good income from the IGA but has failed to settle his obligations to the bank, he should be classified as a wilful defaulter.

b) Non-wilful Defaulter

On the other hand, if a borrower has experienced difficulty in meeting his obligations to the bank due to some natural calamity (such as floods, droughts or pests) or any other reason beyond the borrower’s control as determined by the Manager with the assistance of the SM and the Field Officer, he should be classified as a non-wilful defaulter.

The procedure for recovery action in the case of these two categories will be as follows:

a. In the case of wilful defaulters, immediate action should be instituted to recover the loan amount through legal action.b. In the case of non-wilful defaulters, the Branch Manager/Field Officer/SM should establish personal contacts with the borrower and should offer a re-scheduling scheme to the borrower.c. A borrower, who requires his loan to be re-scheduled due to reasons mentioned above, should discuss with the group and the group should submit a proposal to the relevant SM where the proposal may/may not include a fresh loan to the non-wilful defaulter. When the request for re-scheduling is considered genuine, the SM may recommend the re-scheduling of the loan to PFI.d. If such a re-scheduling facility is granted by PFI, RDD shall make re-arrangements to re-schedule the refinance loan to PFI in respect of re-scheduled loans. This would be done by calculating the fund requirement of the borrower after the re-scheduling and the period involved after which a fresh refinance loan to recover the adjusted amount would be sanctioned by RDD.

26) Disbursement of Project Funds

Subsidiary Loan Agreement will be signed between the CBSL and the licensed banks participating in the programme.

All loans of PFI should be listed, and application for refinance together with supporting documents, in the given formats should be submitted to RDD within one month of granting such loans,

RDD upon receipt of this application will sanction the list of loans contained therein and determine the repayment programme for the refinance loan to PFI.

27) Auditing of Accounts

RDD will prepare annual accounting statements based on the information from the PFI which will be audited by the Auditor General. A certified copy of the report of the Auditor General will be furnished to IFAD once it is available to RDD, but not later than six months after the end of each financial year.

The CBSL reserves the right to revise the terms and conditions in respect of refinance scheme as and when necessary.
