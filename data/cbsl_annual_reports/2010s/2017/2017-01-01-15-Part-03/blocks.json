However, it is not expected PFIs to form new groups for the delivery of the initial allocation of Rs. 90 MN of microcredit. Beneficiaries need to be selected from the existing and matured groups. New groups can be formed if and when the programme allocation is increased after March 2016. Similarly, recruitment of Social Mobilizers to achieve this target is not recommended but PFIs may use their existing field networks for the implementation,c) Homogeneous groups should be formed in terms of economic status. In order to ensure homogeneity, persons who are in the same income category with similar aspirations and expectations would be desired,d) The members of a group should be residents in close proximity enabling them to meet easily for group activities and interactions,e) Attention should be paid on previous defaults by potential members.
