1.1 OverviewT

he stabilisation policy measures taken by

the Central Bank and the government in

the past two years resulted in a number

of notable improvements, although real economic

growth faltered and recorded a multi year low

during 2017. The monetary policy stance of

the Central Bank that was gradually tightened

since end 2015, was tightened further in March

2017 by raising the key policy interest rates of

the Central Bank by 25 basis points. Increasing

market interest rates were allowed to stabilise

at high levels. Nevertheless, the improvements

in relation to the government securities market,

which corrected some distortions that prevailed

in 2015 and 2016, resulted in a significant decline

in yields on government securities, thus exerting

a downward effect on some market interest rates

towards the end of the year. The high nominal

and real interest rates, together with supportive

macroprudential measures, prompted a gradual

deceleration in the growth of monetary aggregates

in 2017. This deceleration was effected via more

active open market operations (OMOs) through

which the Central Bank maintained appropriate

levels of liquidity in the domestic money market by

reducing the Central Bank holdings of government

securities substantially in order to offset the impact

of the rapid buildup of net foreign assets (NFA) of

the banking system due to net purchases of foreign

exchange inflows by the Central Bank. While active

OMOs helped the Central Bank to maintain short

term interest rates, particularly the interbank call

market rate, at desirable levels, the enhanced

monetary policy communication strategy helped

anchor inflation expectations, despite higher than

expected headline inflation driven by supply side

disturbances.

Several measures were introduced to deepen

and develop the domestic foreign exchange market

further during the year. Such measures helped the

Central Bank to purchase a significant amount of

foreign exchange from the domestic market without

creating excess volatility in the exchange rate, while

facilitating a market based exchange rate aligned

with macroeconomic fundamentals. Consequently,

gross official reserves increased to US dollars 8.0

billion by end 2017 with an accompanying qualitative

improvement. The overall balance of the balance of

payments (BOP) recorded a surplus of US dollars

2.1 billion in 2017 after two years of deficits, as a

result of significant inflows to the financial account.

Substantial inflows were observed in the form

of debt capital, while foreign direct investment

(FDI) recorded the highest ever inflows in 2017

supported by improving investor sentiments. In

the external current account, although earnings

from exports increased to the highest levels

recorded, the increase in imports, mainly arising

from drought related imports of petroleum and rice

as well as increased importation of gold, caused

a wider trade deficit. Although inflows on account

of services exports including tourism, and workers’

remittances continued to cushion the impact of the

widened trade deficit to some extent, the current

account recorded a deficit of 2.6 per cent of GDP

during the year. The Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

against the US dollar by 2.0 per cent during the

year, while the real effective exchange rate indices

also depreciated, raising the competitiveness of

the currency. Such a fairly-valued currency in real

terms, is expected to enable a gradual adjustment

of the current account deficit of the BOP in the

period ahead.

In relation to public finance, the revenue

based fiscal consolidation programme continued,

resulting in increased tax revenue as a percentage

of GDP as well as a surplus in the primary account,

which reflects the difference between revenue and

non-interest expenditure, for the first time since 1992

and only the second time since 1955. Nevertheless,

revenue collection was lower than expected, while

government spending was affected by the need to

provide relief to the people affected by inclement

weather conditions, and also by the rising interest

payments. This resulted in an expansion in the

overall budget deficit to 5.5 per cent of GDP. While

the surplus in the primary account helped reduce

the central government debt as a percentage of

GDP to a certain extent, relatively high real interest

rates in the government securities market compared

with real GDP growth contained further favourable

adjustment in public debt dynamics. The continued

generation of higher primary surpluses, together

with increased real GDP growth and moderate real

interest rates, is expected to generate favourable

public debt dynamics at a faster pace in the future.

Adverse weather conditions and their spillover

effects continued to affect real economic activity,

and the economy surprised to the downside by

recording a growth of 3.1 per cent in real terms. This

was significantly below projections of the Sri Lankan

authorities as well as international agencies. In spite

of the low real GDP growth, the economy created

sufficient employment opportunities that induced

a further reduction in the unemployment rate to

4.2 per cent during the year. In terms of expenditure,

growth was supported by the expansion of both

consumption and investment expenditure in 2017,

while net external demand continued to weigh

on growth negatively. Both services and industry

related activities, which together account for

92.4 per cent of gross value added, recorded

growth rates of below 4 per cent. The agriculture

related activities recorded a negative growth for the

second consecutive year, although estimates for

Quarter 4, 2017 indicated a recovery in the sector.

Headline inflation displayed twin peaks during

the year, with the first peak in March 2017 and

the second in October 2017, and remained above

the desired mid single digit levels in most months

due to double digit food inflation. However, core

inflation moderated gradually during the year, as

monetary policy measures to contain inflation

took effect. With the moderation of food inflation,

headline inflation decelerated considerably by the

first quarter of 2018, and the favourable inflation

and inflation outlook as well as the weak real GDP

growth prompted the Central Bank to signal an

end to the tightening cycle of monetary policy, by

lowering the upper bound of the policy interest rate

corridor by 25 basis points in April 2018.

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

Meanwhile, with the exception of a few small

non-bank financial institutions, the financial sector

performed well amidst measures taken by the

authorities to ensure the stability of the financial

sector and to strengthen financial markets and

related infrastructure. Several initiatives were

taken to address possible forbearance in regulation

and supervision, particularly in relation to

non-bank financial institutions and primary dealers

in government securities. Stronger enforcement

mechanisms were introduced to take prompt action

against any non-compliance of regulations. The

rule based and transparent auction mechanism for

government securities helped reduce the volatility

in interest rates and helped the smoothing out

of bunching up domestic debt maturities. The

new Active Liability Management Act (ALMA) is

expected to provide greater flexibility in managing

future bunching of both domestic and external debt.

Furthermore, the Extended Fund Facility

programme with the International Monetary Fund

(IMF-EFF) progressed, with the economy achieving

the end year targets in relation to net international

reserves, the government’s primary balance, and

inflation.

Going forward, addressing the weak growth

performance of the economy through the

implementation of required growth supporting

reforms will remain a priority. Sri Lanka has

advanced gradually to reach a per capita GDP of

US dollars 4,065 by 2017, establishing itself as a

middle income economy. However, the country

can progress further only if policymaking remains

rational with a long term focus on greater public

good, while minimising policy swings motivated by

short term political gains. Therefore, it is essential

that the envisaged reforms are institutionalised to

ensure their sustainability, enabling the country’s

unhindered progression under increasingly

challenging global and domestic conditions. In

this regard, notable progress has already been

achieved in terms of implementing the Inland

Revenue Act (IRA), enacting the ALMA and the

Foreign Exchange Act, and reaching a consensus

with regard to improving the independence of the

Central Bank and facilitating the move towards

flexible inflation targeting (FIT) by 2020. Much

remains to be done in relation to strengthening

public financial management and ensuring fiscal

sustainability through the adoption of binding fiscal

rules, and also with regard to the implementation of

a trade and investment facilitation framework that

could enhance the country’s overall productivity

and effectively link the Sri Lankan economy to

global production networks. The formulation and

implementation of policies must also take into

consideration the effect of such policies on the

vulnerable segments of the population as it is the

poorest of the society who suffer most from failed

policy experiments.

1.2 Macroeconomic

Developments, Stability and Policy Responses in 2017

Real Sector Developments and Inflation

As per official data released by the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS),

Sri Lanka’s real GDP growth decelerated

further during 2017 to 3.1 per cent, from the

growth of 4.5 per cent recorded in 2016.1

Agriculture related activities recorded a contraction

of 0.8 per cent against the backdrop of adverse

1 The GDP analysis in the Central Bank Annual Report is based on official data released by the DCS. In this regard, it is observed that the provisional growth estimates of the DCS for 2017 was considerably below the growth projections of the Central Bank, IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and several other agencies engaged in economic analysis. Inconsistencies were also observed between this provisional growth estimate and leading indicators of economic activity for 2017. It is expected that the DCS will continue to improve data coverage and quality in GDP compilation, at the upcoming revisions as well as future releases of GDP estimates.

weather conditions that continued from 2016,

while a slowdown in economic activity in both

services and industrial sectors was observed.

Amongst the sub activities of agriculture, growing

of oleaginous fruits, vegetables and rice reported

negative growth rates. However, the growth of

forestry and logging, fruits and tea helped contain

the contraction in agriculture activities to some

extent. Industry related activities, accounting for

26.8 per cent of real GDP, grew by 3.9 per cent

in 2017. The growth in industrial activities was

primarily supported by manufacturing activities,

construction activities, and mining and quarrying.

However, the growth of construction activities that

supported overall economic growth throughout

the post conflict period, with the exception of

2015, decelerated notably during 2017. Services

activities, which accounted for 56.8 per cent

of real GDP, grew by 3.2 per cent in 2017, on a

year-on-year basis, driven by the expansion in

financial service activities, wholesale and retail

trade, and other personal service activities. On

the other hand, public administration and defence

activities recorded a contraction, dampening the

services sector growth, while the slowdown in

transportation activities also contributed towards

the moderation in overall economic growth during

the year.

According to the expenditure approach of

GDP estimates, economic growth in nominal

terms was supported by the expansion of both

consumption and investment expenditure in

2017. Consumption expenditure, which accounts

for the largest share of total expenditure of the

economy, recorded a growth of 9.0 per cent in

nominal terms during 2017, compared to the

modest growth of 3.1 per cent in 2016. Higher

growth of consumption expenditure was a result

of the expansion in both public and private

expenditure. Meanwhile, investment expenditure

continued to support growth, with an expansion

of 16.6 per cent in nominal terms. However, the

slowdown in the growth of construction activities

during 2017 contributed towards lowering the

growth momentum in investment expenditure,

compared to 2016. Nevertheless, in nominal

terms, investment as a percentage of GDP rose to

36.5 per cent in 2017, compared to 35.0 per cent

in 2016.2 Economic growth in 2017 was supported

by domestic demand, which grew by 11.5 per cent

2 Sharp revisions to 2016 GDP estimates based on the expenditure approach by the DCS are also observed. Accordingly, at the latest round of revisions, consumption (final consumption expenditure) as a percentage of nominal GDP for 2016 has been revised from 76.2 per cent to 72.4 per cent, while investment (gross capital formation) as a percentage of nominal GDP for 2016 has been revised from 31.5 per cent to 35.0 per cent.

(6.8 per cent in real terms), amidst the deterioration

of net external demand by 9.6 per cent (35.6 per cent

in real terms). Driven by private savings, domestic

savings as a percentage of GDP increased to 29.3

per cent in 2017 from 27.6 per cent in 2016. National

savings as a percentage of GDP also increased

during the year to 33.9 per cent from 32.8 per

cent in 2016, although net current transfers from

the rest of the world decreased to 7.2 per cent of

GDP in 2017 from 7.9 per cent in the previous year.

Accordingly, the domestic savings-investment gap

and the national savings-investment gap stood at

7.2 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively, during

2017, reflecting the dependence of the economy

on the external sector.

The value added growth in the agriculture,

forestry and fishing activities declined due

to the impact of adverse weather conditions

during 2017, as in the previous year. The

output of major agricultural crops such as paddy,

vegetables, other food crops and coconut

declined considerably, mainly due to the drought

that prevailed during the year. Paddy production

during the two seasons, 2016/17 Maha and 2017

Yala, fell significantly, resulting in a decline in

the total paddy production by 46.1 per cent to

2,383 million kg, recording the lowest production

during the last decade. Consequently, rice

production in 2017 was sufficient to meet only eight

months of domestic demand. This drove up retail

prices of rice, prompting the government to reduce

levies on the importation of rice. Accordingly,

rice imports increased during the year to meet

the shortfall in domestic production and arrest

escalating price pressures. Coconut production

was also affected by dry weather conditions that

continued from the previous year. Amidst the

decline in production by 18.7 per cent to 2,450

million nuts, the average retail price of a fresh

coconut increased by 47.1 per cent to Rs. 67.40

during the year. Production of both vegetables and

other food crops was also hampered by adverse

weather, with vegetable production declining

during the 2016/17 Maha season as well as the

2017 Yala season. Meanwhile, encouraged by

elevated prices, tea production, which has been

falling in recent years, improved during 2017 with

favourable agro climatic conditions in major tea

planting areas, particularly during the second half

of the year, and factories operating at increased

capacity. The livestock sector also recorded a

positive performance with increased output in

milk, eggs and most types of meat. However, fish

production remained almost unchanged compared

to the previous year as a result of the decline in

marine fish production that offset the increase in

inland fish production. Considering the importance

of the agriculture sector for the overall wellbeing of

the population, the government provided enhanced

support for the sector.

The growth in industry related activities

slowed during 2017 with the deceleration in

the growth of construction, and mining and

quarrying activities. The construction sector,

which supported the overall growth of the economy

considerably during the post-war era, slowed down

to record a growth of 3.1 per cent compared to

an expansion of 8.3 per cent in 2016. Meanwhile,

mining and quarrying activities also witnessed a

slowdown in growth to 5.9 per cent in 2017 from the

expansion of 14.4 per cent recorded in the previous

year. Value added contribution from electricity, water

and waste treatment activities also slowed down

considerably during the year to 3.9 per cent from

10.1 per cent in 2016. Meanwhile, manufacturing

activities, which accounted for 15.7 per cent of

real GDP in 2017, grew at a sluggish rate of

3.9 per cent in 2017, having grown at 3.2 per cent

in 2016. The favourable developments in export

oriented industries such as wearing apparel,

rubber and plastic products, as well as industries

with a high domestic market orientation, such as

food and other non-metallic mineral products

supported the growth in the manufacturing sector.

Measures taken by the government to promote the

industrial sector during 2017 focused on enhancing

the industrial production capacity of the country

through increased private sector participation.

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

The growth rate of services related activities,

which accounted for over 56 per cent of real

GDP, also moderated during 2017. The growth

of services activities, which was recorded at

4.7 per cent in 2016, decelerated to 3.2 per cent in

2017, particularly due to the contraction in public

administration and defence activities, and the

slowdown in transportation activities. Accordingly,

transportation activities that contributed to over

10 per cent of GDP in 2017, grew marginally by

0.9 per cent. However, the growth in services

activities was supported by the notable growth

of 9.4 per cent in financial services during 2017.

Furthermore, wholesale and retail trade, and

other personal service activities, which grew at

3.8 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively, also

contributed positively towards the growth of the

services sector.

During 2017, the unemployment rate

declined to 4.2 per cent from 4.4 per cent in

the preceding year. In spite of the low overall

unemployment rate, high unemployment

among youth, educated groups and females

has been a longstanding issue in the country.

Nevertheless, there was a decline in the female

and youth unemployment rates during 2017. The

female unemployment rate declined from 7.0 per

cent in 2016 to 6.5 per cent in 2017, while the male

unemployment rate remained unchanged at a lower

level of 2.9 per cent. Further, unemployment among

youth aged 15 to 24 years declined to 18.6 per cent

in 2017, from 21.6 per cent in the preceding year.

The decline in the unemployment rate occurred

amidst an increase in the labour force participation

rate (LFPR), especially among females. The LFPR

amongst females increased from 35.9 per cent in

2016 to 36.6 per cent in 2017. However, the male

LFPR declined marginally to 74.5 per cent in 2017

from 75.1 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile,

the number of employed persons increased by 3.3

per cent in 2017 in comparison to the previous year,

mainly due to increased employment in industry

and services sectors. The increase in employment

despite the size of the public service remaining

broadly unchanged indicates a shift from past

trends in employment generation and constitutes

a more sustainable path for job creation in a

highly constrained fiscal environment. However,

the number of employed persons engaged in the

agriculture sector declined to 26.1 per cent in 2017

due to the subdued performance in agriculture

activities. With respect to migrant labour, departures

for foreign employment declined by 12.6 per cent

in 2017, owing to the policy actions taken by the

government to reduce unskilled female migration

considering its negative social impact, and lower

demand for labour due to geopolitical uncertainties

in the Middle Eastern economies. Overall, labour

productivity during the first three quarters of the

year decreased marginally, and the productivity

level in the agriculture sector remained significantly

low in comparison to other sectors.

Poverty levels continued to decline while the

income disparity of the economy also showed

a marginal improvement. Based on the results

of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey

(HIES) – 2016 of the DCS, the Poverty Head Count

Ratio (PHCR) declined to 4.1 per cent from 6.7 per

cent during the previous survey period of 2012/13.

An improvement in poverty levels was witnessed

across all sectors, with the PHCR improving

to 1.9 per cent, 4.3 per cent and 8.8 per cent in

the urban, rural and estate sectors, respectively.

Although poverty levels have declined steadily, a

considerable portion of the population still remains

just above the poverty threshold, signalling their

vulnerability in the face of unexpected events such

as natural disasters and illness. Hence, continued

efforts towards uplifting the livelihoods of relatively

low income families through empowerment and

effective social safety nets are vital. Meanwhile,

based on the Gini coefficient, household income

inequality improved marginally to 0.45 during the

HIES – 2016 from 0.48 in the HIES – 2012/13.

Headline inflation remained broadly above

the target during 2017, while core inflation

stabilised at desired levels during the latter

part of the year. Despite the tight monetary policy

stance maintained by the Central Bank, the sharp

acceleration in food inflation caused by weather

related supply disruptions resulted in unanticipated

upward movements in headline inflation. Revisions

to Value Added Tax (VAT) and Nation Building Tax

(NBT), and higher commodity prices in the global

market also contributed to high levels of inflation.

Accordingly, headline inflation, as measured by

the year-on-year change in both the National

Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) and the

Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100)

experienced twin peaks, initially in the first quarter

of 2017 and then in the last quarter. However,

the deceleration in food inflation, partly supported

by the government’s initiatives to address price

escalations, helped inflation to decelerate towards

the end of the year. Year-on-year headline inflation

based on the NCPI, which was at 8.6 per cent in

March 2017 gradually slowed thereafter, before

reaching a peak of 8.8 per cent in October 2017

and moderating to 7.3 per cent by end 2017.

Following a similar trend, year-on-year headline

inflation based on the CCPI also rose to 7.3 per

cent in March 2017 and peaked at 7.8 per cent in

October 2017, before declining to 7.1 per cent by

end 2017. On an annual average basis, NCPI based

headline inflation accelerated to 7.7 per cent by end

2017, compared to 4.0 per cent recorded at end

2016, while CCPI based annual average inflation

accelerated to 6.6 per cent by end 2017, compared

to 4.0 per cent at end 2016. However, year-on-year

headline inflation continued its moderation during

the first quarter of 2018, benefiting from a sharp

decline in food inflation. Accordingly, year-on-year

headline inflation based on the NCPI decelerated

to 3.2 per cent in February 2018, while headline

inflation based on the CCPI receded to 4.2 per cent

in March 2018. Meanwhile, core inflation remained

subdued in the second half of 2017, reflecting the

containment of demand pressures through the

tight monetary policy stance of the Central Bank.

Accordingly, NCPI based core inflation declined to

2.7 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2017 from 6.7

per cent at end 2016. Year-on-year core inflation

based on the CCPI declined to 4.3 per cent by end

2017, compared to 5.8 per cent at end 2016. A

further slowdown in core inflation was observed in

early 2018, with year-on-year core inflation based

on the NCPI recording 2.0 per cent in February

2018, while CCPI based year-on-year core inflation

decelerated to 3.4 per cent by March 2018.

External Sector Developments

Despite the setback in the current account,

Sri Lanka’s external sector improved gradually

in 2017 with higher foreign exchange inflows

to the financial account. Earnings from the

export of merchandise goods recorded a notable

double digit growth in 2017, partly supported

by the reinstatement of the European Union’s

Generalised System of Preferences plus

(EU GSP+) facility, and strong institutional and

policy support. However, higher than expected

expenditure on imports, particularly on fuel and

rice imports, to manage the impact of disruptive

weather conditions, as well as imports of gold,

caused an expansion in the trade deficit during

the year. The deficit in the primary income

account also widened during the year, mainly with

the increase in interest payments and reinvested

earnings by direct investment enterprises (DIEs).

Although the healthy growth in transportation

and computer services contributed towards the

increase in earnings from exports of services,

the moderation in earnings from tourism due

to the partial closure of the Bandaranaike

International Airport (BIA) for resurfacing of the

runway and the breakout of the Dengue epidemic

weighed down on the expected expansion

in inflows to the services account. Workers’

remittances also declined in 2017, partly due

to the sluggish growth in the Middle Eastern

economies following geopolitical uncertainties

and relatively low petroleum prices that prevailed

during most months of 2017. The combined

effect of the developments in trade, services and

primary and secondary income accounts was a

widening of the external current account deficit to

2.6 per cent of GDP in 2017 from 2.1 per cent of

GDP in 2016. In contrast, the financial account of

the BOP improved substantially, especially during

the last three quarters of the year, with the highest

ever annual inflow of FDI, foreign investment

in the government securities market and in the

Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), the receipt

of the proceeds of the eleventh International

Sovereign Bond (ISB), the foreign currency term

financing facility, two tranches of the IMF-EFF

programme and other foreign currency inflows to

the government and the private sector. Reflecting

these developments, the overall balance of the

BOP recorded a surplus of US dollars 2.1 billion

in 2017. The gross official reserve position

improved, both in terms of quantity and quality,

reaching a healthy level of US dollars 8.0 billion

by end 2017, from US dollars 6.0 billion at end

2016, while short-term liabilities in the form of

swaps with banks were reduced from US dollars

2.5 billion at end 2016 to US dollars 1.5 billion by

end 2017. Improved external sector performance,

along with measures to deepen and develop the

foreign exchange market further during the year,

facilitated the Central Bank to follow a more

market based exchange rate policy. Accordingly,

even with the absorption of US dollars 1.7 billion

from the domestic foreign exchange market on

a net basis, the external value of the Sri Lankan

rupee remained relatively stable, depreciating

only by 2.0 per cent against the US dollar in 2017.

During the year, the trade deficit widened as

a result of the increased expenditure on imports

beyond expected levels, which outpaced

the considerable increase in earnings from

exports. The trade deficit expanded to US dollars

9,619 million in 2017, compared to US dollars

8,873 million recorded in 2016. As a percentage of

GDP, the trade deficit was at 11.0 per cent in 2017,

compared to 10.9 per cent in the previous year.

Exports rebounded during 2017 to record the

historically highest value in terms of earnings,

thus reversing the lacklustre performance in

exports, which has seen them declining from

33.3 per cent of GDP in 2000 to 12.6 per cent in

2016. Accordingly, earnings from exports increased

by 10.2 per cent to US dollars 11,360 million in

2017. The increase in exports was supported by

the restoration of the EU GSP+ facility, recovery in

external demand, expansion in investment in export

related industries, increased commodity prices in

the international market, conducive external trade

policies together with strong institutional support

and the favourable impact of the flexible exchange

rate policy maintained by the Central Bank. Increase

in earnings from exports of tea (20.5 per cent),

textiles and garments (3.0 per cent), petroleum

products (51.4 per cent) and spices (28.1 per

cent), mainly contributed to the improved export

performance during the year. Earnings from textiles

and garments exports, which accounted for around

44 per cent of total exports, surpassed US dollars 5

billion for the first time in history. However, in spite

of the notable performance in some sectors, export

earnings from coconuts (-4.9 per cent), gems,

diamonds and jewellery (-6.0 per cent) and leather,

travel goods and footwear (-4.4 per cent) declined

during 2017. The USA remained the single largest

buyer of Sri Lanka’s exports in 2017, accounting for

25.6 per cent of total exports, followed by the UK

(9.1 per cent), India (6.1 per cent), Germany (4.8

11

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

per cent) and Italy (4.6 per cent). In line with the

increase in earnings from exports, the overall export

volume index increased by 7.6 per cent, while the

export price index, in US dollar terms, increased by

2.4 per cent.

Expenditure on imports increased

considerably in 2017, mainly due to higher

imports related to inclement weather conditions

and the firming of international commodity

prices. Accordingly, imports increased by 9.4 per

cent to US dollars 20,980 million during 2017, within

which expenditure on non-fuel imports increased

by 5.1 per cent to US dollars 17,552 million.

Expenditure on imports of fuel increased by 38.2

per cent to US dollars 3,428 million during the year

owing to the increase in import volumes of fuel led by

higher demand from the domestic power generation

sector as a result of dry weather in catchment areas

as well as high oil prices in the international market.

Expenditure on rice imports increased significantly

to US dollars 301 million in 2017 compared to

US dollars 13 million recorded in 2016 reflecting

the impact of the reduction of duty on rice imports

to meet the shortage in the domestic market

caused by adverse weather conditions. In addition,

import expenditure on diamonds, precious stones

and metals (50.1 per cent), base metals (37.8 per

cent) and wheat and maize (43.1 per cent) also

increased considerably during the year. A sharp

increase was recorded in gold imports driven by

arbitrage facilitated by tariff differentials between

Sri Lanka and India. However, import expenditure

on machinery and equipment (-4.4 per cent),

sugar (-25.2 per cent), spices (-29.7 per cent)

and fertiliser (-24.9 per cent) declined during the

year. Imports from India accounted for 21.6 per

cent of total import expenditure, enabling India

to regain its position as Sri Lanka’s main import

source, followed by China (18.9 per cent), the UAE

(8.1 per cent), Singapore (6.4 per cent) and Japan

(4.9 per cent). The overall import volume index

increased by 8.1 per cent while the import price

index, in US dollar terms, increased by 1.2 per cent.

The expansion in the trade deficit,

moderation in earnings from tourism, decline

in workers’ remittances and higher interest

payments and reinvested earnings by DIEs led

the external current account deficit to widen in

2017. Despite the slowdown in the growth of tourist

earnings, the services account continued to record

a surplus with the healthy growth in transportation

and computer services subsectors. Accordingly,

the services account of the BOP recorded a surplus

of US dollars 3,338 million in 2017 compared to a

surplus of US dollars 2,879 million in 2016. Earnings

from tourism recorded a growth of 11.6 per cent

to US dollars 3,925 million in 2017 with increased

average spending and duration of stay. The deficit

in the primary income account expanded in 2017

to US dollars 2,355 million from US dollars 2,202

million recorded in the previous year, primarily due

to increased outflows by way of interest payments

and reinvested earnings by DIEs. The secondary

income account remained subdued during 2017

with workers’ remittances declining by 1.1 per

cent to US dollars 7,164 million in 2017 in contrast

to the growth of 3.7 per cent witnessed in 2016.

Reflecting these developments, the current account

deficit widened to US dollars 2,309 million, which is

equivalent to 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2017 from 2.1

per cent of GDP in 2016.

Both net incurrence of liabilities and net

acquisition of assets in the financial account

increased significantly in 2017 compared to

the previous year. On a net basis, the incurrence

of liabilities amounted to US dollars 5,128 million

in 2017, compared to US dollars 2,213 million in

2016, while the net acquisition of financial assets

in 2017 amounted to US dollars 2,944 million

12

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

1

compared to US dollars 31 million in 2016. Inflows

to the financial account increased significantly

with a notable increase in foreign investment in

government securities from the second quarter

of 2017, reflecting increased investor confidence

with improving overall macroeconomic stability.

The financial account was further strengthened

by FDI, which recorded the highest ever annual

inflows during 2017 with large inflows to the

Hambantota Port Project and the Colombo Port

City Project. The proceeds of the ISB amounting

to US dollars 1.5 billion, the receipt of US dollars

1 billion from the proceeds of a foreign currency

term financing facility and the receipt of the third

and fourth tranches of the IMF-EFF amounting to

US dollars 419 million were the other major inflows

to the financial account. Portfolio investment in the

form of equity recorded a net inflow of US dollars

359 million during 2017. The main outflows from

the financial account included the maturity of a

five-year international bond issued by Bank of

Ceylon (BOC) of US dollars 500 million, maturing

of the remaining segment of the international swap

arrangement with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

amounting to US dollars 400 million, and foreign

loan repayments by the government amounting

to US dollars 1,320 million. Meanwhile, the

Central Bank completed the repayment of the IMF

Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) facility obtained in

2009 by June 2017.

Reflecting the improvements in the external

sector, the BOP recorded an overall surplus

in 2017, after recording overall deficits for

two consecutive years. The surplus in the BOP

amounted to US dollars 2,068 million in 2017

against a deficit of US dollars 500 million recorded

in 2016. This improvement in the overall balance

was reflected in the significant increase in gross

official reserves to a healthy level of US dollars

8.0 billion, which is equivalent to 4.6 months of

imports, by end 2017 from US dollars 6.0 billion at

end 2016. A notable improvement in the quality of

reserves was also witnessed during the year with

an improvement in organic reserves in the form of

purchases of foreign exchange from the domestic

foreign exchange market amounting to US dollars

1,664 million, on a net basis, and retiring of domestic

swaps by around US dollars 1 billion during the

year. Apart from direct market purchases, proceeds

from the issuance of the ISB, foreign currency term

financing facilities, two tranches of the IMF-EFF

programme, and the first tranche of the investment

proceeds on account of handing over of operations

of the Hambantota Port to China Merchant Port

Holdings Company Ltd., helped augment the gross

official reserve position during the year. Meanwhile,

Sri Lanka’s total foreign assets also increased to

US dollars 10.4 billion by end 2017, equivalent to

6.0 months of imports, from US dollars 8.4 billion

at end 2016.

Sri Lanka’s total external debt increased

in 2017 primarily due to the increase in the

outstanding debt stock of the government.

The total outstanding external debt of the country

increased to US dollars 51,824 million by end 2017

(59.5 per cent of GDP) from US dollars 46,418

million (56.8 per cent of GDP) by end 2016. External

borrowings of the government increased mainly

due to the issuance of an ISB, foreign currency term

financing facility and project and programme loans.

Despite the receipts under the IMF-EFF during the

year, the outstanding external debt of the Central

Bank declined to US dollars 1,924 million by end

2017 due to the repayment of US dollars 235 million

under the IMF-SBA facility and the settlement of the

international foreign currency swap arrangement

with the RBI. Outstanding external debt of deposit

taking corporations declined marginally, mainly

due to the decline in the holding of debt securities

by commercial banks. The outstanding stock

13

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

of external debt of private sector corporations

and intercompany lending of direct investment

enterprises increased in 2017 while outstanding

debt of State Owned Business Enterprises

(SOBEs) remained broadly unchanged compared

to end 2016. Meanwhile, debt service payments,

which consist of capital repayments and interest

payments on Sri Lanka’s external debt, increased in

2017. Capital repayments decreased to US dollars

3,156 million in 2017 from US dollars 3,243 million

in 2016, of which general government accounted

for US dollars 1,354 million. The repayment of long

term loans obtained for financing projects mainly

contributed to the increased amortisation payments

of the government. However, external debt service

payments of the Central Bank declined noticeably

to US dollars 635 million in 2017, which included

the settlement of the international currency swap

arrangement with the RBI and the settlement of the

IMF-SBA facility. Repayments by the private sector

and deposit taking corporations increased due to the

settlement of an international bond issued by BOC

amounting to US dollars 500 million and increased

repayments of foreign loans by the private sector.

Interest payments increased during the year to US

dollars 1,405 million from US dollars 1,219 million

in 2016. The decline in interest payments by the

private sector and deposit taking corporations was

outweighed by the increase in interest and coupon

payments on outstanding general government

foreign loans and ISBs.

The external value of the Sri Lankan rupee

remained relatively stable in 2017 under a

more market based exchange rate policy

implemented by the Central Bank during the

year. The depreciation pressure on the rupee, which

prevailed particularly during the first two months of

2017, moderated thereafter with increased foreign

investment to the government securities market

and the CSE, and the increase in the conversion

of export proceeds. The depreciation pressure on

the rupee further eased from May onwards with the

receipt of the proceeds from the ISB, the foreign

currency term financing facility and disbursements

of two tranches of the IMF-EFF programme, which

helped improve investor confidence. With these

developments and measures taken to develop

the foreign exchange market, the rupee remained

broadly stable, depreciating by 2.0 per cent against

the US dollar during the year. However, reflecting

the movements in the cross currency exchange

rates against the US dollar, the rupee depreciated

markedly against all other major currencies in

2017. Reflecting the nominal depreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar and other

major currencies, the Nominal Effective Exchange

Rate (NEER) indices depreciated. The 5-currency

NEER index depreciated by 8.68 per cent, while

the 24-currency index depreciated by 7.75 per cent

in 2017. Meanwhile, the Real Effective Exchange

Rate (REER) based on 5-currency and 24-currency

REER indices also depreciated by 4.83 per cent

and 4.85 per cent, respectively, moving close to

the 100 index point mark by the end of the year.

This correction in REER indices will help augment

the country’s competitiveness, which in turn, is

expected to lead to a gradual adjustment of the

current account deficit of the BOP over time.

Fiscal Sector Developments

Fiscal policy during 2017 was aimed at

continuing the fiscal consolidation programme,

with the objective of reducing the budget

deficit and lowering the debt burden of

the government. The government’s primary

account, which excludes interest payments

from the overall balance, recorded a surplus of

Rs. 2.1 billion in 2017 for the first time since 1992

and only the second time since 1955. However, the

current account deficit, which reflects government

dissaving, increased marginally to 0.7 per cent of

GDP in 2017 compared to 0.6 per cent of GDP

in the previous year. Further, the overall budget

deficit deviated markedly from the envisaged target

of 4.6 per cent of GDP and increased to 5.5 per

cent of GDP in 2017 compared to 5.4 per cent of

GDP in the previous year due to slippages in the

revenue collection and unanticipated expenditure

on drought and flood relief. During the year, central

government debt as a percentage of GDP declined

to 77.6 per cent in 2017 from 78.8 per cent in

2016 due to the deceleration of growth of debt

accumulation and the increase in nominal GDP

growth.

Government revenue as a percentage of

GDP declined to 13.8 per cent in 2017 from

14.2 per cent in 2016 due to the decline in

revenue from non-tax revenue sources.

However, tax revenue increased in nominal terms

and also as a percentage of GDP, primarily due to

amendments made to the VAT Act, including the

increase of VAT to 15 per cent from 11 per cent

during the latter part of 2016 and other reforms

introduced to the Economic Service Charge (ESC)

and NBT in 2017 to enhance the collection of

tax revenue. Accordingly, in nominal terms, tax

revenue increased to Rs. 1,670.2 billion by 14.1 per

cent in 2017, from Rs. 1,463.7 billion in 2016, while

as a percentage of GDP, tax revenue increased to

12.6 per cent in 2017 from 12.3 per cent in the

previous year. In contrast, non-tax revenue

declined in 2017 mainly due to weakened

financial performance of major SOBEs. As a

percentage of GDP, non-tax revenue declined to

1.2 per cent in 2017 from 1.9 per cent in 2016, while

in nominal terms it declined by 27.4 per cent to

Rs. 161.4 billion in 2017. The combined effect of the

performance of tax and non-tax revenue resulted in

an increase in total government revenue by 8.6 per

cent to Rs. 1,831.5 billion in 2017 from Rs. 1,686.1

billion in 2016. However, as a percentage of GDP,

total revenue decreased to 13.8 per cent in 2017

from 14.2 per cent in the previous year. The share

of tax revenue in total revenue accounted for 91.2

per cent in 2017 while indirect taxes continued to

be the key constituent of government tax revenue,

accounting for 83.6 per cent of tax revenue.

Total expenditure and net lending as a

percentage of GDP declined to 19.4 per cent

in 2017 from 19.6 per cent in 2016, reflecting

the efforts taken to rationalise government

expenditure. Accordingly, recurrent expenditure

as a percentage of GDP declined to 14.5 per cent

in 2017 from 14.8 per cent in 2016. However, in

nominal terms, recurrent expenditure increased

by 9.7 per cent to Rs. 1,927.7 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 1,757.8 billion in 2016, mainly due to the increase

in interest payments and expenditure incurred on

disaster relief. The increase in the outstanding

stock of debt, especially the outstanding foreign

commercial loans obtained in the recent past,

caused a rise in interest expenditure during the year.

The total interest expenditure, in nominal terms,

grew by 20.4 per cent to Rs. 735.6 billion in 2017

from Rs. 610.9 billion in 2016, while expenditure

on foreign interest payments increased by 30.2 per

cent to Rs. 164.9 billion in 2017 compared to the

previous year. Meanwhile, with the prioritisation

of public investment progammes in line with the

fiscal consolidation process, capital expenditure

and net lending as a percentage of GDP remained

at 4.9 per cent in 2017 compared to 4.8 per cent

in the preceding year. However, in nominal terms,

capital expenditure and net lending increased by

12.0 per cent to Rs. 645.4 billion during the year

in comparison to Rs. 576.1 billion in 2016. Public

investment declined marginally to 4.9 per cent of

GDP in 2017 from 5.0 per cent of GDP in 2016.

However, in nominal terms, public investment

increased by 10.7 per cent to Rs. 657.4 billion in

2017 in comparison to Rs. 594.0 billion in 2016.

The overall budget deficit was largely

financed through foreign sources during 2017,

for the second consecutive year. Accordingly,

59.9 per cent of the total financing need was

covered by foreign financing in 2017 compared to

61.2 per cent in the previous year. Financing from

foreign sources increased during 2017, mainly

due to the issuance of ISBs and obtaining Foreign

Currency Term Financing Facilities (FCTFFs). Net

foreign financing consisted of Rs. 228.5 billion

(US dollars 1,500 million) of ISBs, Rs. 152.7

billion (US dollars 1,000 million) of FCTFFs, net

foreign investment of Rs 57.3 billion in Treasury

bills and Treasury bonds, and Rs. 779.4 million

of net borrowings related to foreign project loans.

Government financing through domestic sources

accounted for 40.1 per cent of total financing

in 2017, which amounted to Rs. 294.3 billion in

nominal terms. This was mainly through provisional

advances of Rs. 116.5 billion and Treasury bonds

of Rs. 109.1 billion, while a net repayment of

Rs. 81.7 billion was recorded in Treasury bills.

The government financing from the banking sector

accounted for 63.8 per cent (Rs. 187.7 billion)

of net domestic financing in 2017 compared to

56.3 per cent (Rs. 140.0 billion) in 2016, which was

largely due to the significant increase of financing

through commercial banks amounting to Rs. 375.7

billion in 2017 in comparison to a net repayment of

Rs. 43.1 billion in 2016. The impact of borrowings

from commercial banks was partly offset by the net

repayment of Rs. 187.9 billion to the Central Bank.

As a percentage of GDP, central government

debt declined to 77.6 per cent by end 2017

from 78.8 per cent recorded at end 2016.3 The

reduction in the debt to GDP ratio in 2017 was

mainly attributed to the deceleration in the growth

of debt accumulation and the increase in the

3 Hambantota Port related debt continued to be classified under debt liabilities of major public non-financial corporations in 2017.

nominal GDP growth. Central government debt, in

nominal terms, increased to Rs. 10,313.0 billion

by end 2017 from Rs. 9,387.3 billion at end 2016.

Of this, total outstanding domestic debt increased

to Rs. 5,594.4 billion by 4.7 per cent, while total

outstanding foreign debt increased substantially to

Rs. 4,718.6 billion by 16.6 per cent.

Monetary Sector Developments

The Central Bank continued to maintain its

tight monetary policy stance in 2017 to curtail

adverse inflation expectations and the possible

acceleration of demand driven inflationary

pressures due to excessive monetary and

credit expansion. Following the increase in

inflation during early 2017, which could have led to

the buildup of adverse inflation expectations amidst

high money and credit expansion, the policy interest

rates of the Central Bank, the Standing Deposit

Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending

Facility Rate (SLFR) were increased by 25 basis

points in March 2017 to 7.25 per cent and 8.75

per cent, respectively, in addition to the 100 basis

point increase in policy interest rates and the 1.50

percentage point increase in the Statutory Reserve

Ratio (SRR) in 2016. Macroprudential measures to

contain credit to selected categories of the private

sector also complemented the conduct of monetary

policy during 2017. Despite such contractionary

measures, headline inflation continued to remain

above the Central Bank’s targeted range mainly

due to the disturbances to domestic food supply

caused by prolonged adverse weather conditions

along with the implementation of changes to the

government tax structure. Nevertheless, underlying

inflation, as measured by the movements in core

inflation, gradually moderated with the transmission

of the tight monetary policy stance maintained over

the past two years. Headline inflation also reverted

to mid single digit levels in the first quarter of

2018 with the decline in volatile food prices. The

moderation in inflation in the first quarter of 2018

and the favourable inflation outlook as well as

the continued negative output gap compelled the

Central Bank to end its policy tightening bias and

reduce the SLFR by 25 basis points on 4 April 2018.

Effective liquidity management by the Central Bank

helped steer the Average Weighted Call Money

Rate (AWCMR), which is the operating target of

the current monetary policy framework, along the

desired path. Accordingly, until mid July 2017,

AWCMR increased and hovered around the upper

bound of the policy interest rate corridor, reflecting

tight liquidity conditions in the domestic money

market. Along with surplus liquidity levels since mid

July 2017, and active OMOs of the Central Bank,

AWCMR stabilised at around 8.15 per cent. High

real and nominal interest rates, resulting from tight

monetary policy measures adopted by the Central

Bank, caused a moderation in the growth of broad

money supply and the growth of credit extended

to the private sector by commercial banks, as

expected. With the reduction in SLFR on 4 April

2018 and appropriate OMOs, AWCMR declined

gradually to around 8.00 per cent by mid-April 2018.

In view of the tight monetary conditions in

the economy, market interest rates continued

to increase further during 2017, although some

market interest rates started to stabilise or

adjust downwards towards the end of the year

reflecting the improved liquidity conditions in

the market. Deposit and lending interest rates of

commercial banks continued to increase during

most of 2017 raising the cost of funds in the

economy. However, some moderation in deposit

rates was observed towards the end of the year,

while lending rates stabilised at elevated levels.

Yields on Treasury bills in the primary market

showed upward movements during the first four

months of 2017 reflecting the increased borrowing

requirements of the government in a purely auction

based system for issuing government securities

and the tight monetary conditions. However, yields

on Treasury bills in the primary market adjusted

downwards thereafter, supported by improved

liquidity conditions in the domestic money market

and the favourable market sentiments with the

availability of foreign financing to the government.

Accordingly, by end 2017, yields on 91-day,

182-day and 364-day Treasury bills declined by

103 basis points, 133 basis points and 127 basis

points, respectively, from end 2016. Yields on

Treasury bonds in the primary market also followed

a similar pattern, and the improved auction system

contributed largely to the moderation of yields

and corrected some distortions that prevailed in

2015 and 2016. The issuance of foreign currency

denominated debt securities, such as Sri Lanka

Development Bonds (SLDBs) and ISBs, also

helped ease the pressure on yields of domestic

debt instruments, particularly in the second half of

2017, to some extent. The secondary market yield

curve for government securities shifted downwards

and remained relatively flat in 2017, particularly at

the long end, facilitated by the improvements in

investor sentiment as well as anchored inflation

expectations. Meanwhile, interest rates applicable

on corporate debt securities remained high during

2017. Moreover, reflecting the gradual rise in key

interest rates in the international markets, interest

rates applicable on foreign currency denominated

deposits maintained with commercial banks

increased marginally during 2017.

Reserve money growth moderated to

9.8 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2017,

compared to the high growth of 27.1 per cent

recorded at end 2016, mainly due to the impact

of the high base observed in 2016 on account

of the upward adjustment to SRR in January

2016. In absolute terms, reserve money expanded

only by Rs. 83.6 billion during the year to reach

Rs. 939.8 billion by end 2017, compared to the

notable expansion of Rs. 182.7 billion reported

in 2016. From the liability side, both currency in

circulation and the commercial banks’ reserve

balances with the Central Bank contributed to the

moderate increase in reserve money during 2017.

From the assets side, reserve money expansion

during 2017 was driven entirely by the increase in

NFA of the Central Bank along with the increase

in reserve assets of the Central Bank, reflecting

the accumulation of the foreign reserves and a

decline in foreign financial liabilities of the Central

Bank during the year. In contrast to the increase

in NFA, net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central

Bank declined considerably by Rs. 203.9 billion to

Rs. 93.6 billion during 2017, compared to the

increase of Rs. 200.3 billion in 2016. The sharp

decline in NDA reflected the contraction in net credit

to the government (NCG) by the Central Bank, with

the Central Bank unwinding its holdings of Treasury

bills to offset the rapid buildup of NFA resulting from

the net purchases of foreign exchange inflows by

the Central Bank. Accordingly, NCG by the Central

Bank declined significantly by Rs. 187.9 billion to

Rs. 225.1 billion during 2017, compared to the

increase of Rs. 183.1 billion in the previous year.

Broad money (M2b) growth, which remained at

elevated levels during most of 2017, decelerated

towards the desired levels during the latter

18

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

part of the year, driven by the moderation

in domestic credit. M2b growth decelerated to

16.7 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2017 compared

to a growth of 18.4 per cent at end 2016. Both NFA

and NDA of the banking system contributed to the

expansion in monetary growth during the year.

NFA of the banking system increased substantially

by Rs. 352.8 billion in 2017 in comparison to the

moderate increase of Rs. 66.9 billion recorded in

2016. In addition to the considerable expansion in

the Central Bank’s NFA, NFA of commercial banks

also expanded by Rs. 65.2 billion in 2017 resulting

from a decline in foreign borrowings of commercial

banks during the period under review. The

expansion in NDA moderated to Rs. 549.7 billion,

in absolute terms, during the year, compared to the

expansion of Rs. 772.8 billion in 2016, driven by

the slowdown in domestic credit observed during

the second half of the year. Within NDA, NCG by

the banking system increased by Rs. 196.4 billion

in 2017, entirely due to the expansion in NCG from

commercial banks, amounting to Rs. 384.3 billion

during the year, mainly with increased investment

in government domestic debt instruments in spite

of the decline in NCG from the Central Bank in

2017. Credit obtained by public corporations from

the banking sector increased by Rs. 19.2 billion

in 2017 in comparison to the decline of Rs. 27.9

billion observed in 2016.

In response to the continued tight monetary

policy stance, credit extended to the private

sector by the banking system decelerated to

desired levels by end 2017. Growth of credit to

the private sector decelerated to 14.7 per cent

by end 2017 on a year on year basis, compared

to the growth of 21.9 per cent recorded at end

2016. In absolute terms, the expansion in credit

to the private sector amounted to Rs. 617.4

billion during the year compared to an increase of

Rs. 754.9 billion in 2016. The deceleration of credit

extended to the private sector was caused by high

market interest rates along with tight monetary

conditions in the economy as well as the supportive

macroprudential and fiscal policy measures.

Moreover, with the exception of the acceleration

observed in Personal Loans and Advances, the

growth of credit extended to all major sectors

decelerated during 2017. Accordingly, credit to

the Services and Industry sectors expanded by

8.3 per cent and 19.6 per cent, respectively, in

2017, compared to the growth of 35.4 per cent

and 22.2 per cent, respectively, in 2016. Growth

of credit to the Agriculture and Fishing sector also

moderated to 14.1 per cent by end 2017, compared

to the growth of 17.0 per cent recorded in 2016.

Credit under the Personal Loans and Advances

category increased by 18.6 per cent by end 2017

compared to 15.2 per cent recorded at end 2016.

Financial Sector Developments

The performance of the financial sector

improved, while the stability of the system

was maintained in 2017 amidst the challenging

economic environment. The improved

performance of the financial sector was driven

mainly by banks, other deposit taking financial

institutions and contractual savings institutions.

Banking sector credit, which reported a steady

growth during the first half of the year, moderated

gradually during the second half of the year in

response to the tight monetary policy measures.

The banking sector asset base surpassed

Rs. 10 trillion recording an annual growth of 13.8

per cent, with the increase in loans and advances

that accounted for 62.5 per cent of the total assets

by end 2017. Meanwhile, the non performing

loan (NPL) ratio declined marginally during the

year reflecting the improvement in asset quality

of the banking sector. Profitability of the banking

sector, as measured by Return on Assets (ROA)

and Return on Equity (ROE), improved noticeably

with net interest income growing by 12.3 per cent

during 2017. Capital adequacy ratios of banks

were also maintained at comfortable levels under

Basel III in order to absorb any adverse shocks,

while the Statutory Liquid Assets Ratio (SLAR) of

the domestic banking sector continued to be higher

than the minimum statutory requirement of 20 per

cent.

The Licensed Finance Company (LFC) and

the Specialised Leasing Company (SLC) sector

recorded a moderate growth during the year

with low credit growth, declining profitability

and increasing NPLs. The deceleration in credit

growth in the sector can be mainly attributed to the

restrictive macroprudential measures taken with

respect to lending for motor vehicles and the modest

growth witnessed in the economy during the year.

Exhibiting a shift in the funding mix, the growth of

assets of the sector was mainly funded through

deposits while borrowings of the sector declined

compared to the high growth recorded in 2016. The

sector maintained its overall capital and liquidity

levels well above the minimum requirement during

the year in spite of the weak financial position of a

few LFCs. A gradual moderation was observed in

activities of the Primary Dealer (PD) sector in 2017.

The asset base of PDs showed a considerable

expansion during the year, although profitability of

the industry declined marginally. The Employees’

Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees’

Trust Fund (ETF), the leading institutions in the

contractual savings sector, witnessed a healthy

growth in their assets in 2017, while securing

reasonable returns to their members. The asset

base of the insurance sector also expanded during

the year underpinned by the significant growth

recorded by the life insurance sector.

Domestic financial markets witnessed some

volatility during 2017. The domestic money

market operated with excess liquidity, particularly

during the second half of the year consequent to

net purchases of foreign exchange by the Central

Bank in the domestic foreign exchange market.

Volatility in domestic money market was closely

managed through active OMOs to avoid any

undue pressure on short term interest rates. The

rule based and transparent auction mechanism for

government securities also helped to reduce the

volatility in interest rates. Although the Sri Lankan

rupee depreciated against the US dollar due to

outflows of foreign investment from the government

securities and the equity markets on expectations

20

of tightening of financial conditions by advanced

economies during the first half of the year,

improving investor sentiments, particularly with the

continuation of the IMF-EFF programme, attracted

foreign inflows that helped ease the pressure on the

rupee. The payments and settlement systems saw

continued improvements and functioned without

major disruptions.

The supervisory and regulatory framework

governing the financial sector continued to

strengthen during the year to enhance the

safety and resilience of the financial sector.

Prudential measures taken by the Central

Bank were mainly focused on licensed banks,

LFCs and SLCs with a view to enhancing their

transparency, capital requirements, liquidity and

risk management frameworks. Addressing possible

regulatory forbearance, particularly in relation

to non-bank financial institutions and primary

dealers, was prioritised during the year. Several

measures were taken to terminate or limit finance

business operations of weak financial institutions

to safeguard depositors and the long term stability

of the sector. With regard to the capital market,

the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

issued directions with respect to capital adequacy,

disclosures and regulatory compliance of stock

brokering companies with a view to enhancing the

transparency and resilience of the sector, while the

Demutualisation Bill approved by the Cabinet in

2017 is yet to be implemented.

1.3 Global Economic Environment and Outlook

According to the World Economic Outlook

(WEO) of the IMF, the global economy continued

to gain momentum in 2017 with a substantial

majority of economies registering a pickup

in growth. Two thirds of the world economies,

comprising emerging and developing economies

as well as advanced economies, registered higher

growth rates in 2017, compared to 2016. For the

first time since the Global Financial Crisis, there is

synchronised growth in the US, UK, EU and Japan.

Growth in the advanced economies and China was

triggered mainly by the increase in expenditure

on fixed capital formation and accommodative

monetary policy, while an increase in private

consumption contributed to increased growth in

most emerging market economies. Global trade

recovered strongly and recorded substantially

higher levels in 2017 compared to the past two years,

despite the beginning of a series of successive

retaliatory trade restrictions imposed on each other

by the US and China. During the year, oil prices

escalated as a result of the strengthening global

growth momentum, supply side disruptions in the

US, a unanimous Organisation of the Petroleum

Exporting Countries Plus (OPEC+) agreement to

curb oil production and geopolitical tensions in the

Middle East. Despite the rapid rise in crude oil prices

in late 2017, prices are expected to decline in the

medium term with US production reaching record

levels on the back of increased shale oil supplies.

The increase in oil prices partly contributed to the

increase in headline inflation in most economies.

Prices of most types of commodities, including

petroleum, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), metals

and agricultural products, increased considerably

in 2017, compared to the previous year.

Despite the overall strengthening of global

growth in 2017, low levels of inflation called

for the continuance of an accommodative

monetary policy in most advanced economies.

The US economy continued to show signs of a

strengthening labour market and rising economic

activity, despite brief episodes of volatilities

resulting from natural disasters. In light of this,

the US Federal Reserve proceeded to increase

the Federal Funds target rate in March, June and

December 2017, and again in March 2018. US tax

reforms are expected to stimulate near term activity,

but this is not expected to negatively impact inflation

as the Federal Reserve is expected to undertake

further policy rate hikes during the course of the

year. Economic activity of the UK, however, was

negatively impacted by its decision to leave the

EU and due to the effect of the referendum-related

depreciation in the sterling pound. Japan and

several euro area economies, including Germany,

experienced a strong momentum in domestic

demand as well as external demand during the

year. Although China continued to progress on the

‘Supply Side Structural Reform’ programme, the

lack of resolution of several structural problems are

expected to cause some moderation of growth in

2017. With the dissipation of the negative effects of

the demonetisation and the teething problems of the

Goods and Services Tax (GST), prospects for the

Indian economy improved. The US dollar remained

lacklustre during the year amidst the strengthening

of other major currencies and due to policy

uncertainties. However, a largely synchronised

expansion across the euro area stemming from

improving labour markets and an accommodative

monetary policy helped buoy the euro in 2017.

The strength of the yen has been supported by

the recovery of the Japanese economy and the

currency’s safe haven status. In spite of increased

global market volatility, financial flows and portfolio

flows to emerging market economies remained

robust during the year.

The global growth momentum is expected

to improve further in 2018 and 2019 with better

prospects for both advanced and emerging

economies in terms of investment, production

and trade, though possibly in the face of

tightening financial market conditions and

disruptions arising from trade wars between key

global economies. The cyclical upturn registered

in the last two years, which was synchronised

across a broad cross section of advanced, and

emerging and developing economies, is expected

to augment further to record higher growth rates in

the next two years and begin to moderate thereafter

with growth in advanced economies returning to

potential levels. Global growth in the next two years

will mainly be driven by the pickup in domestic and

external demand of the US, Europe and advanced

Asian economies, as well as the effects of tax

policy changes in the US that involved corporate

tax reductions. In the US, fiscal adjustments to

offset the deficit created through the tax reduction

are expected in the medium term. Meanwhile,

emerging and developing Asia is projected to grow

at 6.5 per cent and 6.6 per cent, respectively, in

the next two years. The effects of enhanced growth

and business sentiment in the advanced nations

are expected to spill over to the emerging market

economies mainly through trade channels. The

main risk factors affecting the aforementioned

improvement in the growth momentum in the world

22

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

1

are: the possible tightening in financial markets, if the

inflation in the US shows signs of being higher than

anticipated, triggering faster policy rate tightening

by the Federal Reserve System; and the escalation

of the trade war between the US and China. Risks

are present also in the realm of the financial sector.

With low interest rates and low volatility in asset

prices that persisted in the last few years, more

finances have flowed into financial assets with

higher risks and less creditworthy borrowers.

Meanwhile, the major trade agreements, involving

the US and the UK, that are being renegotiated,

as well as the progress of the ‘One Belt One

Road’ initiative, will have a significant bearing on

production, trade and investment across the globe

in the next few years. Non-economic factors such

as climate change, natural disasters and increase

in political risks in some regions of the world would

also pose considerable risks for global economic

outcomes.

In this global context, Sri Lanka needs to

make a firm commitment to expeditiously carry

out the implementation of growth focused

policy measures in order to tap into the

enhanced production and trade levels in the

world, while strictly managing sovereign and

corporate exposure to international financial

markets. Sri Lanka’s economic growth has been

well below the average growth rates of emerging

market economies, and declined below the global

growth estimate in 2017. Therefore, Sri Lanka

needs to urgently make a firmer commitment to

carry out well focused strategies to make use of

the increase in demand in the advanced nations

and to manage volatile capital flows. The continued

geopolitical tensions in the Middle Eastern

region further highlights the need to rely less on

workers’ remittances and promote export focused

industries instead. The escalation of the trade

war between the US and China could have some

bearing on Sri Lanka’s trade not only with these

two economies, but also with other trading partners

through value chains. On the fiscal and monetary

fronts, the possibility of increases in interest rates

in the global financial markets could increase the

cost of sovereign and corporate debt issued at

flexible rates, while making new issues of debt

instruments costlier. Therefore, managing external

debt at prudent levels, while closely monitoring the

exposure of financial institutions in Sri Lanka to

global markets, will be crucial in the medium term.

1.4 Medium Term Macroeconomic Outlook

The growth trajectory of the economy

is projected to gradually improve over the

medium term, especially with higher private

sector participation supported by conducive

macroeconomic policies. Although the growth

performance of the Sri Lankan economy, in 2017,

remained subpar as per the estimates of the DCS,

the annual real GDP growth is expected to gradually

improve to around 6.0 per cent by 2022. The growth

strategy of Sri Lanka is based on developing the

country to transform itself into a hub in the region

with a knowledge based, highly competitive social

market economy. To this end, numerous key

initiatives, including the Port City development

project, the Megapolis project, and the economic

corridor projects, are being carried out. The Port

City development project would support the drive

towards making the country a hub in the Indian

Ocean by developing a world class enclave that

would include a financial district in addition to other

features such as luxury living spaces and office

complexes that would also attract FDI. Moreover,

developments within the ports sector that would

exploit Sri Lanka’s geographical position would also

support this drive towards establishing the country

23

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

as an economic hub in the region. In addition,

the Megapolis Master Plan would transform

the Western Province into a smart, vibrant and

liveable area, while addressing issues pertaining

to urbanisation. The development initiatives in the

Plan, which include housing, transportation, waste

management, disaster mitigation and development

of industrial townships and technological hubs,

would also support the overall growth strategy of

the economy. Moreover, continued digitalisation

of the economy; mechanisation of agriculture

and industrial activities; skills development of

the workforce to be in line with the economic

strategy and the expectations of the labour force;

diversification of the economy both in terms of

domestic production as well as the export basket;

together with continued improvement in economic

and social infrastructure would also be crucial

components of attaining a sustainable growth path

for the country. Furthermore, the development

initiatives of the country should be implemented in a

manner that would uplift the wellbeing of the citizens

while giving due consideration to environmental and

social implications. Higher value employment is the

most effective measure of transmitting the benefits.

These expected developments, underpinned

by stable macroeconomic conditions, including

maintaining inflation at a low and stable level,

would result in a gradual improvement in income

levels with per capita GDP surpassing US dollars

6,000 by 2022. Achieving a growth path above

the cautious path mapped in the Medium Term

Macroeconomic Framework, could be possible

with the efficacious implementation of the planned

development projects, which would stimulate both

foreign and domestic private sector economic

activity in the country.

The external sector is projected to improve

over the medium term with appropriate policy

measures and positive developments on the

external front, including the gradual recovery

of export markets. The deficit in the external

current account is expected to be tapered over the

medium term with the expected improvements in

the trade account, inflows to the services account

and workers’ remittances. Exports are projected

to grow at a higher rate than imports, narrowing

the trade deficit as a percentage of GDP from

11.0 per cent in 2017 to 8.7 per cent by 2022. The

acceleration in exports is expected to be aided by

the increased volume and complexity of the export

basket, improved competitiveness of the economy

in the export markets due to the flexible exchange

rate policy, the reinstatement of the EU GSP+

and enhanced market access through improved

trade linkages through the existing and new trade

agreements. Imports are also projected to increase

over the medium term with higher imports of

intermediary and investment goods. Meanwhile,

the surplus in the services account is expected

to improve over the medium term supported by

higher inflows, particularly on account of tourism,

Information and Technology (IT) and transportation

services. Tourist earnings are expected to increase

at a higher rate due to the addition of new star class

hotels and more effective marketing campaigns.

Proceeds from IT related exports are expected to

continue their rapid growth trajectory. Earnings

from transportation will rise with the anticipated

acceleration in port and airport related activities

due to enhanced external trade. A moderate growth

in workers’ remittances, which have historically

proven to be a resilient flow of foreign exchange

to cushion the current account deficit, is expected

over the medium term. Meanwhile, the financial

account of the BOP is expected to improve with

both debt and non-debt creating inflows. Reflecting

the gradual rise in the reliance on non-debt creating

inflows, FDI as a percentage of GDP is expected

to increase. Proceeds from ISBs, and other

concessional and non-concessional loans are also

expected to assist the financial account, while the

government securities market and the CSE are

expected to be augmented with foreign inflows.

With the envisaged developments in the BOP,

the country’s gross official reserves are projected

to improve to a healthy level, thus reducing the

country’s vulnerability to external shocks.

The government is expected to continue its

focus on the revenue based fiscal consolidation

process in the medium term. Accordingly, the

budget deficit is estimated to decline to 3.5 per

cent of GDP by 2020, while recording surpluses in

the current account as well as the primary account.

The government revenue to GDP ratio is expected

to increase to around 17 per cent by 2021, with the

expected increase in revenue collection following

the implementation of the IRA, which simplifies

the tax structure and broaden the base, and the

continuation of the automation process of revenue

collecting agencies. Further, on the expenditure

front, the continuation of the automation of Treasury

operations through the Integrated Treasury

Management Information System (ITMIS), the

presentation of quarterly expenditure reports and

income outcome reports to the Parliament, the

rationalisation of unproductive public expenditure,

the establishment of an integrated system for all

welfare programmes under the Welfare Benefits

Board (WBB), the effective implementation

of Statements of Corporate Intent (SCIs), the

introduction of automatic pricing mechanisms for

25

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

fuel and electricity and divesture of non-strategic

enterprises are expected to be given priority.

Accordingly, over the medium term, government

expenditure is expected to be maintained at around

20-21 per cent of GDP and public investment is

expected to remain at the current level of around

5 per cent of GDP. Further, the government aims at

promoting and executing projects based on Public

Private Partnerships (PPPs) amidst the limited fiscal

space available for public investment. Meanwhile,

since both domestic and foreign debt service

obligations have become a serious challenge, in

the medium term, liability management activities

are expected to be carried out to smooth out the

maturity profile of the central government debt

portfolio with the recent enactment of the ALMA.

Further, a medium term debt strategy is being

developed jointly by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)

and the Central Bank for better management of

the government debt. With these developments

and the continued generation of higher primary

surpluses, the central government debt to GDP

ratio is expected to decline to below 70 per cent

after 2020. In addition, the Fiscal Management

(Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003 is expected to

be amended to incorporate binding fiscal rules,

clearly defined escape clauses and correction

mechanisms in case of a breach of fiscal targets to

improve fiscal discipline.

Initiatives by the Central Bank to successfully

adopt flexible inflation targeting (FIT) as the

monetary policy framework in Sri Lanka are

expected to ensure price stability over the

medium term. In early 2017, the Central Bank

officially announced its intention to move towards

a FIT framework by 2020. Several measures were

taken since the official announcement to facilitate

the smooth transition towards adopting FIT. This

included the formulation of a Road Map for the

adoption of FIT, highlighting the required legislative,

institutional, operational and policy reforms. The

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been

obtained to introduce comprehensive amendments

to the Monetary Law Act (MLA) to strengthen Central

Bank independence and facilitate the adoption of

FIT as the monetary policy framework, in addition

to other amendments to improve governance

of the Central Bank, strengthen financial sector

oversight and boost fiscal-monetary coordination.

Other ongoing reforms related to institutional

and operational arrangements will also continue

to ensure the successful transition towards the

adoption of FIT. The efforts to strengthen the

modelling and forecasting capacity at the Central

Bank with technical assistance from the IMF would

continue during this transition. Also, the Central Bank

would gradually narrow the existing policy interest

rate corridor in order to improve the efficiency of

monetary policy signals. Meanwhile, the Central

Bank will continue to improve monetary policy

communication. In spite of the transition to FIT,

monitoring of the behaviour of monetary and credit

aggregates will continue to ensure the availability

of sufficient liquidity for the smooth functioning of

the economy. Overall, the conduct of monetary

policy will be aimed at maintaining inflation at mid

single digit levels in the medium term, forming the

platform for the economy to achieve its growth

potential. The increasing resilience of the financial

sector along with the envisioned improvements

in associated policies, infrastructure and reforms

would complement the price stability initiatives of

the Central Bank by way of enhancing the efficacy

of the transmission of monetary policy through a

deep and liquid financial market.

1.5 Issues and Policies

Although Sri Lanka made progress towards

greater macroeconomic stability through the

adoption of appropriate policy measures, its

26

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

1

growth performance was not at desired levels,

highlighting the urgent need to implement

structural reforms to address deterrents to

growth. While recognising the fact that numerous

measures are being implemented to strengthen the

growth framework, the ensuing section highlights

key issues and required policies with the view of

re-emphasising the need to address such issues,

if the country is to move to a higher growth path in

the medium term and beyond.

The agriculture policy focus needs to

gradually shift towards empowering farmers

to engage in commercially viable activities.

Recognising the vital role played by the agriculture

sector in supporting the overall wellbeing of the

country’s population through ensuring food security

and employing over a quarter of the labour force,

successive governments have implemented

numerous measures to promote this sector.

These measures have helped in increasing the

agriculture output of the country with Sri Lanka

recording near self sufficiency in rice. One such

measure that has been adopted to improve the

agriculture sector is the fertiliser subsidy scheme.

This scheme was first introduced in 1962 and

continued thereafter, with the exception of a short

period in early 1990s, in various forms including

the cash grant offered to paddy farmers from the

2016 Yala season. However, the existence of the

subsidy scheme has increased the reliance on

fertiliser resulting in overusage and contamination

of soil and water resources. Despite the heavy

use of inorganic agro inputs, productivity levels

have remained very low, resulting in a majority of

those working in the agriculture sector earning low

incomes while end consumers continued to face

high and volatile prices. Therefore, the policy focus

should gradually shift from subsidy dependent,

subsistence agriculture activities towards

empowering the farming community to engage in

commercially viable agriculture. While the subsidy

scheme may need to continue in a more targeted

manner to assist specific sectors, emphasis is

required to promote farmer groups to increase

economies of scale, while improving access to

finance to promote mechanisation in the sector

and improving the agricultural logistics network

to increase market access both domestically and

internationally. Moreover, measures should be

taken to reduce post harvest losses through better

storage, transportation techniques and adopting

best practices in post harvest food handling, as well

as other productivity enhancing mechanisms such

as crop rotation, water management, and crop-

livestock integration. In addition, enhanced focus in

ensuring that agriculture supply is compatible with

market demand would also support better income

levels to farmers. Developing derivative products

for agricultural goods must also be considered

to reduce price uncertainties faced by farmers.

The shift towards commercial agriculture will help

strengthen the financial condition of farmers and

generate higher productivity levels in the sector.

Addressing the host of challenges faced

by the plantation industry would enable the

sector to improve productivity and to remain

competitive, thereby enabling the attainment of

its economic potential. The prolonged drought,

floods and the erratic rainfall, which prevailed

throughout 2016 and 2017 caused production levels

to decline across the agriculture sector. However,

an array of other factors, including the drawbacks in

the structural organisation of the plantation industry,

as well as poor agro management practices at the

enterprise level, contributed to aggravating the

ill effects of the adverse weather conditions and

threatened the viability of the industry even under

normal environmental conditions. Issues common

across the agriculture sector together with crop

specific challenges have contributed towards

27

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

current low productivity levels witnessed in the

plantation industry. Lack of replanting, high labour

costs, low quality of the output, pest attacks, low

quality imported seeds, improper application of

fertiliser and the fragmented nature of institutional

support are some of the issues that plague most of

the plantation industries. These problems have been

compounded by the glyphosate ban. In the context

of Sri Lanka's tea industry, it has been steadily

losing its share in the global market due to its low

adaptability to innovations and poor productivity as

a result of lack of reforms. Meanwhile, a significant

increase in the quality of rubber produced is

required if the industry is to compete with synthetic

rubber. In the coconut sector, a major challenge

is that plantations are increasingly being diverted

for real estate purposes, both legally and illegally.

In addressing the issues related to the plantation

industry, measures need to be in place to avoid

haphazard interventions, while the planning

process must consider the long term needs of

the industry. On major plantation crops, Sri Lanka

competes with countries that have substantial

cost and technological advantages. Therefore,

Sri Lanka should explore avenues to diversify

into niche areas, such as planting medicinal crops

via intercropping or as plantation crops. In the

meantime, strong policy measures are needed to

strengthen plant quarantine services in Sri Lanka.

Improving seed production and curtailing the import

of low quality seed, which have sometimes been

found to contain alien pests, via supporting the

seed industry and the seed certification service will

also be important. Since the main factor affecting

poor replantation in most industries is the high

risks and high volatility in incomes perceived by

planters, an enabling macroeconomic environment

with predictable prices and productivity linked

wage structures, sound crop insurance schemes

and market based hedging instruments to support

prices, would help sustain the plantation industry.

Heavy investment in infrastructure has not

been able to stimulate the industry sector to

spur growth, highlighting the need to align

the objectives of infrastructure development

with those of industrialisation. Sri Lanka, along

with many other middle income and developing

economies, invested heavily in mega infrastructure

projects in the past decade. Although such

investment helped to increase gross value added

in the economy in the short term, the contribution

of certain investments to enhance the productive

potential of the tradable sector over the longer

time horizon has been limited. Overall, the rates of

return have been disappointing. This was primarily

due to the underutilisation of such infrastructure

by industries and the inability of the infrastructure

facilities to attract complementary investment by the

private sector. Moreover, during the past several

years, FDIs were channeled to infrastructure

development, non-tradable services and other

inward focused industries, rather than export

oriented industries. Investment into manufacturing

industries, agribusiness or tradable services has

been very low compared to other comparable

economies in Asia, implying that the availability of

infrastructure is not a sufficient condition to attract

investment. Meanwhile, scrutiny of the industrial

infrastructure reveals that there is a significant

disconnect between development of logistical and

industrial infrastructure in the country. While the

coordination between the government agencies

engaged in investment promotion and industrial

development needs to be improved for the success

of economic zones, proliferation of small industrial

groups in random areas of the country poses

significant impediments to gaining agglomeration

economies through industrial clustering. The

experience of other countries shows that

infrastructure led economic growth models yield

positive results only when such infrastructure is

used to support industries. A few large industrial

28

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

1

zones, with appropriate logistical facilities that help

achieve economies of agglomeration, promoted

rapid industrialisation in countries like Japan,

China, South Korea and Vietnam. Therefore,

while ensuring that strict needs assessments

and feasibility studies are carried out prior to

infrastructure development projects, emphasis

is also required on developing industries in the

surrounding areas simultaneously.

Despite low levels of unemployment,

there are policy concerns surrounding the

contribution of labour markets to the growth

process, especially in light of the country’s

attempts to progress as a middle income

economy in the medium term. The commitment

of successive governments towards universal

healthcare and education has enabled Sri Lanka

to create a resourceful pool of labour, many of

whom are engaged in some form of employment,

as reflected by the low levels of unemployment in

the recent past. However, the lack of translation

of the prevailing low levels of unemployment into

substantial gains in economic growth highlights

that merely increasing the quantity of jobs will no

longer suffice. While the share of the employed in

the agriculture sector had been steadily falling, 26.1

per cent of the employed continued to be engaged

in the sector, contributing only 6.9 per cent of GDP

in 2017. This raises concerns regarding labour

productivity and underemployment in this sector.

This condition is a more serious concern in the

Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Uva provinces,

where the share of employment in the Agriculture

sector is four times as high as the sector’s share of

GDP. Further, the issue of the current and future

labour force being inadequately equipped with

an education and skills set that is relevant to the

needs of modernising a more complex economy

continues to remain unresolved, despite this being

highlighted by several stakeholders over the years.

While initiatives taken by the government in recent

years to ensure formal and relevant education over a

longer period of time and encompassing vocational

education opportunities are commendable,

the availability of higher or tertiary education

opportunities remains largely insufficient to fulfill

the skill and knowledge gaps in the economy.

Sri Lanka’s low levels of tertiary enrolment rates,

which are below the averages for lower middle

income and upper middle income countries, has

also negatively weighed on the country’s Global

Competitiveness Index (GCI) Ranking in Higher

Education and Training. Although several policy

initiatives are underway to remodel Sri Lanka as

an export oriented economy and thereby position it

in the export value chain, policy efforts to improve

the quality of the labour force lack sufficiency,

coordination and commitment. Policy initiatives

pertaining to quality, relevance, equity and capacity

of the education sector, specifically pertaining to

higher education, need to be urgently prioritised as

high quality human resources are essential for the

transformation of the economy. At present, growth

in Sri Lanka is driven by the Industry and Services

sectors, both of which would be subject to rapid

technological change in the upcoming decade. The

World Bank estimates that 69 per cent of jobs in

India and 77 per cent of jobs in China are under

threat from automation. While surveys conducted

on labour demand by the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Commission (TVEC) and the DCS show

that there is a high demand for several categories of

semi-skilled and unskilled labour, such occupations

are likely to be automated in the very near future,

rendering them redundant and resulting in a loss of

employment opportunities. It is vital for policymakers

to engage with stakeholders to assess the impact

of such technological change and adopt proactive

policy measures, which will enhance the skills

29

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

sets of those who are currently engaged in such

tasks so that they possess some degree of mobility

across occupations in the wake of any ‘waves’ of

automation. In addition, almost 60.2 per cent of

employment is in the informal sector. According to

the DCS, 73 per cent of enterprises in the industrial

sector surveyed in 2015, employed between 5 to

25 people. This highlights several policy concerns,

especially with regard to productivity, innovation,

and growth and at a micro level in terms of the

rights of workers, availability of social security and

decent working conditions. The economy is in dire

need of not simply employment creation but policy

initiatives that focus on the improvement of labour

productivity and access to better paid jobs, both of

which can ensure efficiency driven growth, effective

utilisation of resources and a growth process that

will also reduce poverty and inequality.

The quality assurance and accreditation of

private education services need to be further

strengthened to support the healthy growth of

this sector. Given the tight fiscal space, private

sector engagement in the provision of education

is imperative to meet the country’s socioeconomic

challenges such as dynamic labour market

requirements, increasing demand for world class

education from higher income households and

limited opportunities at the state sector schools

and universities. In this regard, the private sector

has gradually increased its presence in education

during the past few decades, both in general and

tertiary education. The demand for private sector

school education is rising in the country, especially

due to the overcrowding in government schools.

Although government approved private schools

are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis by

the Ministry of Education and provincial and zonal

authorities, there is no such regulatory mechanism

for international schools at present. With no

regulatory or monitoring mechanism in place, the

facilities, qualifications of the staff, and the quality

of education provided by international schools can

be highly uneven. As there is no transparent rating

and standardisation process, parents are unable to

make an informed decision regarding their choice

of school. Since state sector schools are unable to

provide equitable access to high quality education

to all students, higher income households opt

for international schools. International schools

generally differ from each other and from government

and government approved private schools in terms

of their methods of teaching, medium of instruction,

curriculum, co-curricular activities, examinations

and evaluation procedures, discipline, their

affiliations and accreditations, standards, etc.

Therefore, a regulatory framework and a quality

assurance mechanism that takes into consideration

the aforementioned differences should be

established, while ensuring that these regulations

do not hinder the well functioning high quality

international schools. Bringing all international

schools under the purview of a regulatory body

can facilitate the introduction of minimum quality

standards for international schools. Meanwhile,

the government is in the process of establishing an

independent Quality Assurance and Accreditation

Authority (QAAA) with a view to introducing a

regulatory framework for both state and non-

state universities, encompassing prerequisites for

entry, a uniform credit and qualification framework,

teaching and training standards, and evaluation

methods. It is essential that the proposed QAAA is

set up expeditiously to introduce quality standards

across all disciplines to avoid recurrence of issues

similar to those experienced in relation to institutes

providing private medical education in the past, and

create an environment conducive for private sector

engagement in the provisioning of high quality

tertiary education that meets global standards.

IntroductionPrice reforms for petroleum products have been a long-standing policy issue in Sri Lanka due to its direct impact on the cost of living and the cost of production as well as on the overall macroeconomic stability. The petroleum sector of Sri Lanka is dominated by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), a strategically important state-owned business enterprise, which accounts for approximately 86 per cent of the retail market share. Sri Lanka depends heavily on imported petroleum products to meet the primary and secondary energy requirement of the country. Moreover, as a small net-oil importing country, Sri Lanka is a price taker in the global market. Due to the high impact of petroleum prices on the cost of production, and thereby the cost of living, setting of petroleum prices has always been a politically sensitive issue in the country. However, non-adjustment of retail fuel prices to reflect their costs has seriously challenged the financial viability of the CPC on numerous occasions while creating macroeconomic imbalances and in fact lowering consumer welfare. Non-cost reflective administered prices have resulted in high fiscal costs associated with fuel subsidies, large contingent liabilities of the government, excessively high import bills and balance of payments issues, weakening of state-banks’ balance sheets through heavy borrowings by the CPC as well as sub-optimal resource allocation and inefficient subsidy targeting. With the view of ensuring the financial viability of the CPC and reducing fiscal costs of fuel subsidies, in January 2002, the government implemented a cost-reflective pricing formula, which was in effect during 2002 and 2003. In 2004, the pricing formula was revised to align it with the changed market conditions, but this was not used to set prices thereafter. Consequently, since 2004, successive governments have opted for administered retail fuel prices, which have been revised by the government from time to time.

BOX 1Petroleum Price Reforms

Passthrough of Petroleum Prices in Sri LankaFuel prices have shown large fluctuations in global markets in the past decade, although the administered prices for petroleum products were not adjusted in the domestic market to reflect the movements in the global market. If the domestic prices reflect the total cost of the product, i.e., volume-weighted average cost of the imported and locally refined product including taxes, the passthrough of prices is said to be complete. The cost of petroleum products comprises Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) price, terminal charges for storage and bulk distribution, transport costs, exchange rate variation cost, short-term financing costs and personnel and overhead costs of the CPC. However, passthrough of global oil price fluctuations into the domestic market has been incomplete in the past, and any gains or losses of this incomplete passthrough were allowed to reflect in the CPC's balance sheet.

During 2011 to 2014, petroleum prices were exorbitantly high in the global markets. However, the government did not allow a full passthrough of oil prices during this period, resulting in a deterioration of the financial performance and an accumulation of heavy losses by the CPC. Conversely, Sri Lankan consumers did not benefit from declining global prices due to the non-adjustment of domestic prices to reflect global oil price movements. For example, during the mid-2008 to mid-2009 period and September 2014 to end-2015 period, global petrol prices declined by 44 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, although domestic petrol prices were adjusted downwards only by 24 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, during these periods. Moreover, during the same periods, global diesel prices declined by 54 per cent and 58 per cent, respectively, but local diesel prices were reduced only by 36 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. Due to heavy accumulated losses of the CPC in periods of high global petroleum prices, the government was unable to allow a full passthrough

of prices when global oil prices were declining. By end 2017, the accumulated losses of the CPC amounted to Rs.217.3 billion.

Global oil prices have been on a rising trend since February 2016 due to OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries limiting oil production. However, domestic retail oil prices of the CPC remained unchanged since 2015, except for the reduction in kerosene prices in early 2017. Due to this non-adjustment of domestic petroleum prices, despite the gradual increase in global oil prices local retail petroleum prices remain significantly lower compared to most countries.

Economic Implications of Administered Fuel PricesConsumer subsidies are generally determined as the differential of the full passthrough price and the administered price.1 The full passthrough price, which consists of the sum of supply cost, transportation cost, profit margins and taxation, is the total cost of the product. In the absence of any pricing formula, the difference between

sales revenue and the total cost provides the basis for estimating fuel subsidies in Sri Lanka.

Notably, aforementioned petroleum products, except super diesel and auto diesel for electricity, are sold at subsidised prices. Kerosene has the largest subsidy cost per litre, followed by petrol and diesel. However, given the large volume sold, petrol contributed the most to the burden of subsidy during 2017. Further, the fiscal cost arising due to the incomplete passthrough of fuel prices would crowd out high priority public spending with an adverse impact on growth and poverty reduction (Coady, et al., 2012). Moreover, fuel oil used by the electricity generation sector are not subject to administered prices and are sold by the CPC at a price above the cost recovery level. During 2017, profit earned by the CPC from the power generation sector amounted to Rs. 19.2 billion which indicates that part of the fuel subsidy is cross-subsidised by the electricity generation sector, raising the cost of electricity generation. Higher electricity prices have a negative impact on the competitiveness of the economy.

There are no formal budgetary provisions for financing petroleum subsidies resulting from administered prices being below cost-recovery levels, and accordingly, the CPC tends to bear part of the subsidy costs by reporting heavy financial losses over the years. Consequently, the CPC has to rely on bank borrowing to cover losses and meet liquidity requirements. Heavy borrowing by the 1 There are no pre-tax subsidies in Sri Lanka and accordingly, consumer subsidies are a measurement of the post-tax subsidy.

Prices that do not reflect the true cost of production will lead to sub-optimal decisions related to production and demand. If the domestic prices do not reflect the rising global prices, demand for petroleum products will not adjust accordingly, leading to excessive increase in the import bill, creating external imbalances. During 2011, 2012 and 2013, petroleum imports accounted for more than 23 per cent of the total import cost of Sri Lanka highlighting the external vulnerability of the economy to rising oil prices.

2 Passthrough describes the extent to which shocks to costs change prices. Hence, passthrough rates play an important role in determining tax incidence, as it describes means by which the party that physically pays a tax can transmit the effects of that tax to others (Ganapati, Shapiro, & Walker, 2016).

3 Three most important environmental factors to be considered in energy prices as per Coady, Parry & Shang (2017), are CO2 emissions, premature deaths from local air pollution, and broader externalities, such as congestion associated with petroleum powered motor vehicles.

There are many emerging market economies that do not fully passthrough2 changes in international petroleum prices to domestic retail prices. This non-adjustment of retail prices leads to adverse consequences on petroleum tax revenues and tax volatility (Coady, et al., 2012). Fuel taxes are often an efficient and equitable source of tax revenues that avoid possible higher distortionary taxes elsewhere in the economy. In addition, in countries like Sri Lanka where direct tax revenue collection is low, fuel taxes could be deemed as an effective source of revenue to be used for road infrastructure developments by the government. In addition, excessive use of non-renewable energy sources, particularly fossil fuels, causes a diversity of high cost environmental effects.3 Economic analysis and empirical evidence reveal that pricing policies are noticeably more effective than regulatory approaches in addressing such issues (Parry, Evans, & Oates, 2014).

Way Forward

The administered pricing mechanism for petroleum products, which has been implemented with a discretionary approach, has weakened the financial viability of the CPC while creating numerous macroeconomic issues. Hence, the re-introduction of a cost-reflective pricing mechanism and supporting the continuance of such mechanism are imperative to curtail inefficiencies in the current petroleum pricing system. The implementation of an automatic price adjustment mechanism will facilitate a better passthrough of changes in international fuel prices to domestic retail prices, avoiding inefficient price subsidies, stabilising of fuel tax revenues, and reducing the adverse effect on the environment.

However, there are numerous aspects to consider in implementing a pricing formula for petroleum products. Fedrico et al. (2001) argue that full passthrough of international price changes may be suboptimal, in the face of shocks of large magnitude, in particular. If the government is concerned about excessive price volatility or if the market is imperfect, an automatic pricing mechanism that adjusts prices periodically to reflect international prices is more appropriate (Coady, et al., 2010). Accordingly, the government can implement a partial passthrough of prices in the short term while ensuring full passthrough in the medium to long term. This can be achieved through various price smoothing rules: moving averages (setting retail prices based on the moving average of past spot prices); trigger rules (retail prices are updated only if spot prices change by more than a predetermined trigger amount); and max-min rule (this rule places a ceiling and a floor on the level of petroleum prices) (Fedrico, Daniel, & Bingham, 2001). However, Fedrico et al. (2001) elaborate on the fact that governments in developing countries would not

33

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

be well prepared to address the associated short-term fiscal risks emanating from price smoothing activities. In this regard, the government has the option of using self-insurance mechanisms such as the establishment of an oil price stabilisation fund to reduce the short-run fiscal risk associated with price smoothing. Nevertheless, international experiences suggest that a well-planned and comprehensive reform strategy is key to ensure the success of the policy, and accordingly, the International Monetary Fund (2017) identifies five broad lessons learnt from different country experiences to make the reform a success: formulate an integrated reform strategy, protect the most vulnerable, build broad public support, refrain from ad hoc adjustments that do not address the root of the problem, and move gradually when feasible. These are key lessons to be followed in Sri Lanka as well, in the inevitable implementation of a cost reflective pricing formula for domestic fuel prices.

also needs to be extended to other utilities as well, to ensure the financial viability of the relevant state-owned business enterprises.

Moving towards more cost reflective pricing

strategies for energy not only ensures the

financial viability of SOBEs, but also promotes

the efficient use of energy in production and

consumption. Currently, administered pricing

strategies are implemented in petroleum and

electricity sectors, where domestic petroleum

prices and electricity tariffs often do not reflect

the true economic cost of the provision of these

utilities, leading to suboptimal resource allocation

decisions in the economy. If the administered prices

of petroleum are not raised during the periods of

oil price escalation in global markets, the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC) tends to make

substantial losses while consumer demand does not

adjust to reflect the true cost of petroleum products.

With regard to electricity generation, losses of the

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) escalate if domestic

electricity tariffs are not adjusted to reflect the cost

of generation during times of increased reliance on

thermal power. Deteriorating financial performance

of CPC and CEB has repercussions on the banking

sector through heavy bank borrowing, which also

undermines the Central Bank’s policy measures

to curb credit growth to manage inflation when

needed. Higher demand for energy arising from

inappropriate pricing also results in increased

pressure on the BOP, and thereby on the exchange

rate. On the other hand, administered prices and

tariffs that do not reflect the actual cost may not

pass on benefits to users during periods of low

energy prices in global markets or periods with

lower power generation costs. This could affect

the country’s competitiveness while the cost of

living could remain artificially high, worsening the

living standards. Further, uncertainty arising from

sudden and sharp revisions to administered prices

of energy also affects consumer and producer

decisions adversely. Therefore, it is essential that

urgent steps are taken to implement cost reflective

pricing strategies for the energy sector with fixed

time intervals for domestic price revisions, in order to

ensure the financial viability of SOBEs and promote

optimal resource allocation in the economy. At the

same time, it is crucial to ensure the losses that

arise due to operational inefficiencies of these

SOBEs are addressed without passing such losses

to consumers through prices and tariffs. Moreover,

it is important to actively promote the variable

electricity tariff scheme based on the time of usage

that is currently available for household consumers

to better manage electricity demand.

Expeditious implementation of effective

and affordable traffic management solutions is

vital to curb numerous negative externalities

arising from traffic congestion. In response to

the increasing number of vehicles in main cities,

the government has continued to expand and

upgrade the existing road and highway network.

However, the increase in traffic, most of which are

low occupancy vehicles, has been rapid, and has

resulted in heavy traffic congestion, wasting time and

financial resources of the country, while increasing

pollution levels. While buses, as a mode of public

transportation, are slow, congested, uncomfortable

and unpredictable, three wheelers and taxis are

relatively expensive, prone to accidents and

unavailable at peak times. Meanwhile, the structure

of the private bus industry has led to an unhealthy

competition, with little improvement in the quality of

services provided. Also, there are other factors that

contribute to high traffic congestion, such as the

extremely high levels of traffic rule violations, lack

of discipline in driving and disruptive construction

work on the roads during daytime. Therefore, while

implementing the light rail transit (LRT) system,

as envisaged in the Megapolis Development

plan, other solutions that are targeted directly at

the root causes of the current increase in traffic

congestion, and are relatively faster and cheaper

to be implemented must also be explored by the

government. These include rigorous educational

campaigns to discourage the culture of driving in

which violations of road rules are the accepted

norm, implementation of a wide network of CCTV

cameras for monitoring and enforcement without

discrimination, incorporating modules on road

discipline at primary and secondary school levels,

regulating the three wheeler industry, as well as

restructuring the bus network in the Capital of

Colombo into a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) System

as mooted by industry experts.

The expansion of exports through

diversification is of utmost importance to ensure

external sector stability. Sri Lanka has been

continuously experiencing a deficit in the external

current account from 1978, which has been financed

mostly through external borrowing. Imbalances in the

external sector has also led the country to depend

on external assistance of agencies, such as the

IMF, in addressing this issue with a short to medium

term focus. While debt creating foreign inflows can

serve to finance the current account deficit in the

short term, this is clearly unsustainable. Developing

an export oriented manufacturing sector, supported

by services exports, would present the long term

solution. Development policies should be aimed

at promoting new industries through streamlining

regulations related to business activities, encouraging

private sector initiatives related to export oriented

manufacturing activities, encouraging research and

development, exploiting opportunities to tap regional

and global value chains (GVC) and ensuring stable

macroeconomic conditions. Since the country has

the potential to grow as a knowledge- and services-

based economic hub in the Indian Ocean, a new trade

policy framework for Sri Lanka has been prepared

to improve domestic production capacity and trade

performance, while formulating a new national

export strategy for Sri Lanka. This has identified

six focus sectors and four trade support functions

to develop exports. Meanwhile, focus on industrial

zones would also be a key ingredient in developing

exports together with productivity enhancements

across the economy. However, international

market access should also grow in tandem with

the envisaged expansion in exportable output.

Accordingly, Sri Lanka is in the process of entering

into new trade agreements to improve international

market access. In 2017, Sri Lanka entered into a

comprehensive free trade agreement with Singapore

and is in discussions with India and China on similar

agreements. Upon finalising these agreements,

35

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

Sri Lanka will be among the handful of countries

that have free trade agreements with both India

and China. No country has bilateral access to both

these large and fast growing markets, together with

access to Europe under the GSP+ facility. However,

continuous dialogue with domestic stakeholders is

also a key element in ensuring the success of these

strategies by identifying concerns of the business

community and maintaining transparency in the

negotiation process. Trade adjustment packages

to mitigate adverse impacts, if any, resulting from

structural changes in the economy owing to new

trade agreements are also important. Moreover,

Sri Lanka has also enacted antidumping legislation,

which would provide local producers protection

against unfair trading practices, if implemented

properly. Safeguard provisions have also been put in

place to guard against import surges. Hence, going

forward, local producers should be educated on

the opportunities and measures available for them

to exploit these agreements for the benefit of the

country, leading to a favourable long term outcome

in the external sector.

While Sri Lanka succeeded in attracting FDI

inflows of over US dollars 1.9 billion in 2017,

the country’s FDI inflows remain significantly

low in comparison to its regional peers. In 2017,

Sri Lanka achieved the historically highest FDI

inflows to the country mainly due to the improving

macroeconomic environment and positive investor

sentiments. However, Sri Lanka, being a twin

deficit country with persistently high budget and

external current account deficits, has been relying

on domestic and foreign borrowings to finance these

deficits over the years. Meanwhile, the bunching of

future foreign debt repayments and limited access

to concessional funding with Sri Lanka’s transition

towards an upper middle income country raise

concerns regarding financing the BOP with foreign

debt continuously. Additionally, amidst rising

global interest rates, Sri Lanka is vulnerable to

possible reversal of capital flows particularly from

the government securities market and the CSE.

In this context, it is imperative to attract further

non-debt creating foreign inflows in the form of FDI,

as these financial flows are a long term source of

funds, thereby supporting the resilience of the

external sector. In addition, FDI not only fills the

savings-investment gap, but is also a significant

driver of economic development with associated

flows of technology, management practices and

access to international markets. Therefore, the

country needs to strengthen its investment policy

framework further while harmonising investment

policy with other government development policies

and strategies, particularly trade and industry. Inter-

agency coordination in implementing these policies

are equally important to ensure policy consistency,

which is a key prerequisite to attract foreign

investment.

Over-reliance on workers’ remittances

from the Middle East to finance the current

account deficit needs to be redressed. The

Middle Eastern region remains the primary market

for Sri Lankan migrant workers, accounting for

over 90 per cent of annual departures for foreign

employment from the country and more than half

of the total remittance receipts. However, a notable

decline in labour migration to the Middle Eastern

countries has been observed in the wake of low

oil prices and increasing unrest in the region in

the recent years, dampening the earnings from

inward remittances. Several regional economies

including India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, have

also witnessed declines in workers’ remittances

similar to the moderation experienced by Sri Lanka

during the past few years. Hence, Sri Lanka cannot

expect a continuous growth in workers’ remittances

if the primary source of remittances continues

to be repatriations from unskilled workers and

36

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

housemaids from the Middle East. With the decline

in remittances from the Middle Eastern region,

there is a growing necessity to transform Sri Lankan

migrant workers from unskilled and housemaid

categories to semi skilled and skilled levels.

In addition, there is a need to find alternative

destinations by exploring new labour markets

and entering into bilateral agreements with other

advanced Asian and European economies. This

will reduce the vulnerability created by the exposure

of Sri Lankan foreign remittances being sourced

largely from a single region. As a remedy to the

mismatch between the international demand for

jobs and Sri Lanka’s supply capabilities, investment

in competency development for progressive up-

skilling of migrant workers through language

and vocational training on par with international

standards would be beneficial in securing

employment opportunities with higher earnings.

However, it is also observed that migration of skilled

workers and professionals is often associated with

tied migration where the family accompanies the

migrant worker leading to permanent settlement in

destination countries. Resultant weaker links with

Sri Lanka would limit foreign exchange remittances,

whilst also creating brain drain. Meanwhile, the

number of foreign workers in Sri Lanka also

appears to be rising, signaling that there will also

be increased foreign exchange outflows in terms

of remittances in the near future, and thus reducing

the surplus in the secondary income account in the

BOP. In this backdrop, while taking appropriate

measures to maximise inward workers’ remittances,

it should be noted that Sri Lanka will no longer be

able to depend solely on remittances as a major

foreign exchange earner to finance the external

current account deficit. Hence, priority should be

given to attract non-debt creating inflows, such

as FDI, and route those funds to export oriented

enterprises with the view of generating more

sustainable foreign exchange flows in the long run.

Such enterprises can also absorb labour made

available domestically, if there is any reduction in

temporary migration to the Middle East, in higher

value employment.

While the commitment to increase

government revenue through tax reforms

has yielded results, there is further space to

enhance direct tax revenue by strengthening

tax administration through Information and

Communication Technology (ICT) to bring

in tax evaders into the tax net. Tax evasion by

individuals and corporates has been one of the

primary reasons for the decline in direct tax revenue

as a percentage of GDP. Tax evaders deliberately

understate or avoid reporting the true state of their

net worth and income to the tax authorities to

reduce tax liability. An effective method to address

tax evasion is by the close monitoring of high end

consumption driven transactions. This requires

reconciling income declarations with data retrieved

from high end transactions such as luxury car sales

and property sales. Although, the Inland Revenue

Department (IRD) carries out such examinations

and follows up with semi automated systems, a

sophisticated electronic system linking up relevant

institutions with the tax system is essential to

efficiently confront tax evasion. Such an automation

process has already commenced with various

tax reforms initiated to improve tax administration

recently, including the introduction of the Revenue

Administration Management Information System

(RAMIS). The full implementation of the RAMIS is

expected to connect the system with over 20 other

external institutions including the Central Bank,

licensed banks, Sri Lanka Customs, Registrar

of Motor Vehicles, Condominium Management

Authority, CSE and the Land Registry, for effective

tax reconciliation. Addressing the remaining

infrastructure and human resource bottlenecks

to implement this much needed system would

enable authorities to tackle tax evasion efficiently

37

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

and address the obvious disconnect between

the growth of high end economic activity and the

declining direct tax revenue to GDP ratio.

The speedy implementation of liability

management activities is imperative to manage

risks associated with maturing foreign currency

debt. With the country’s graduation to middle

income level in the late 2000s, the availability of

foreign grants and concessional loans declined,

requiring the government to mobilise commercial

debt such as ISBs continuously from the global

capital market to finance its external current account

and budget deficits. While the government’s

present commitment to implementing revenue

based fiscal consolidation would contribute to

containing debt at a sustainable level in the medium

to long term, addressing near term bunching of

debt repayments and mitigating refinancing risks

of the debt portfolio remain crucial. The recently

introduced ALMA provides the necessary legal

framework to implement liability management

exercises on the central government debt portfolio

with a view to smoothening out future debt

servicing payments by restructuring the existing

debt stock through mechanisms such as buyback

options, switching and prefunding arrangements.

The successful implementation of the liability

management framework will help reduce the

country’s external vulnerability in the period ahead.

Priority must, therefore, be attached to developing

a comprehensive liability management strategy to

reduce rollover risk associated with the bunching of

external debt in 2019-2023.

The commitment of the government to

fiscal discipline through strict adherence to

the proposed fiscal consolidation path is of

paramount importance to the success and

sustainability of the proposed FIT framework.

Over several decades, Sri Lanka has been straddled

with high fiscal deficits and onerous government

debt levels. As high levels of fiscal deficits and

government debt can impede the Central Bank’s

ability to control inflation, it is essential that

consolidation continues until fiscal sustainability is

achieved. An expansionary fiscal policy inevitably

fuels inflationary pressures. This exerts pressure

on both interest rates and the currency. In addition,

heavy reliance of the government on domestic

markets for deficit financing can also be a concern

as this may lead to “crowding out” of productive and

efficient private sector investment. This can weigh

negatively on economic growth over the medium

to long term. Despite the strong commitment of the

monetary authority to fight inflation aggressively,

particularly under an inflation targeting regime,

macroeconomic stability and sustained growth

cannot be achieved unless there is commitment of,

and coordination between, both monetary and fiscal

authorities. Therefore, ensuring fiscal sustainability

will be of paramount importance to not only

successfully transition to the new monetary policy

regime but also to achieve economic progress over

the medium to long term.

Although Sri Lanka’s financial sector

has significantly progressed over time, its

shallowness in terms of product coverage

remains an impediment to the country’s overall

economic development. Continued expansion in

the financial sector, as reflected by the growth of

total assets of the sector, has been considerable,

particularly since the end of the internal conflict.

During this period, total assets of the financial sector

increased by more than three-fold and its outreach

in terms of the network of branches and automated

teller machines (ATMs) has been impressive, thus

enhancing financial inclusion. Although financial

institutions continued to bring innovation and new

technology into their day-to-day products and

services, their progress in deepening the financial

market through the introduction of new financial

38

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

1

products has been noticeably slow. Financial

derivatives and derivative related instruments as

a means to hedge risk are available as products

only in a handful of banks. Insurance products,

particularly pension schemes, have been slow in

taking off, as such schemes are often deemed too

rigid and less personalised. The equity market in

Sri Lanka mainly features traditional instruments,

whilst the possibility of trading equity derivatives has

been left largely unexplored. The corporate debt

market also remains miniscule in spite of the many

measures to revive this segment of the financial

market. However, notable developments observed

in technology and payments and settlements

infrastructure could be used by providers of financial

services as catalysts to deepen the financial

market and bring forth greater financial inclusion

and stability as well as economic development. In

the meantime, from a user perspective, the lack of

awareness and confidence about existing financial

products, let alone new ones, continues to be a major

setback for the deepening of the financial market.

Programmes to enhance awareness and financial

literacy would generate demand for new financial

products, thereby encouraging financial institutions

to introduce novel instruments or schemes. Tailor

made insurance and pension schemes will create

greater public interest in such products, thereby

enhancing savings and investment of the country

as well. Equity market activities could be boosted

through popularising margin trading, which has

been used sparingly by market participants due

to the cost and restrictions involved, while short

selling could be facilitated with proper monitoring

and regulations in place. Overall, financial

deepening achieved through the development of

appropriate financial products and markets would

not only enhance liquidity, transparency and

reach, but would also increase the resilience of the

economy to shocks. Moreover, promoting healthy

competition among financial institutions would also

generate cost effective and innovative products,

effectively deepening the financial market, which in

turn would improve the effectiveness and speed of

monetary policy transmission as well.

A myriad of opportunities presented by

the expanding digital economy needs to

be enhanced while addressing associated

challenges through strengthening the current

regulatory and legislative framework. With

growing volumes of online transactions across

the globe, there is notable progress in the role of

emerging market economies in the form of both

buyers and sellers of goods and services on online

platforms. There is a range of proven and potential

benefits to be gained by business-to-business (B2B)

and business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce,

such as enhanced participation in international

value chains, greater market access and reach, and

improved internal and market efficiency, as well as

lower transaction costs. Research shows that there

are significant productivity gains associated with

selling over the Internet and that micro, small and

medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) and those in

services industries stand to gain more. Although

there has been a rapid expansion in the Sri Lankan

e-commerce industry, largely attributed to the

strong growth in mobile penetration, e-commerce

sales are comparatively low when compared to

regional peers. Moreover, while this industry opens

new avenues that can translate into improved

job creation and productivity gains, it also entails

legislative and regulatory concerns. Strengthening

legislation pertaining to e-transactions, consumer

protection, privacy and data protection, and

cybercrime is essential to safeguard all stakeholders

of the ‘digital economy’, but such strengthening

must take into account the dynamic nature of

e-commerce. In the wake of the growing incidence

of cybercrime and Sri Lanka’s rapid integration

with the global digital economy, concerted efforts

are required in the area of law enforcement and

39

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

to continuously strengthen the technical capacity

of emergency response teams. On the other hand,

the internet also presents several opportunities for

timely and relevant evidence based policymaking

using “big data”. Such data science can help provide

invaluable insights into consumer behaviour while

enabling meticulous surveillance of risks and

even enhanced regulatory and fiscal compliance.

Sri Lanka is also yet to entirely familiarise itself

with advanced digital financial assets such as

crypto assets. While crypto assets and related

transactions are yet to make a strong entry into the

Sri Lankan economy, in an increasingly globalised

environment, the country remains vulnerable to

the risks associated with such assets, especially in

terms of the anonymity that they offer and how they

may serve as a vehicle for money laundering and

terrorist financing. There needs to be concerted

policy efforts to assess these novel and dynamic

challenges and identify appropriate regulatory and

supervisory technologies that will augment the

opportunities presented by the digital economy

while safeguarding stakeholders of both the digital

and traditional economies.

Avoiding frequent reversals of policy

decisions is essential to reinforce trust in

public policymaking and strengthen stability in

social and economic spheres. In recent times,

Sri Lanka has witnessed an array of examples of

inconsistent policies and policy reversals, spanning

economic, social and political spheres. Some

examples are policies with regard to investment

approvals, land holding by foreigners, use of

asbestos, use of polythene, use of weedicides,

provision of fertiliser subsidy, long term power

generation planning, provision of private medical

education, and women’s rights on alcohol purchase

and related work. In democratic politics, public

policymaking is inherently a process of striving

towards an equilibrium of competing objectives,

competing interests, competing stakeholders and

competing strategies to allocate scarce resources

amongst numerous competing needs. Therefore,

there can seldom be one solution to an issue that

satisfies all stakeholders, even after strenuous

public consultation. However, frequently changing

decisions once taken, will only lead to more public

dissatisfaction and tarnish government credibility,

while inviting more disruptive lobbying for

continuous changes. Furthermore, as expectations

play a central role in economic progress, uncertainty

about the durability of policy decisions taken

would affect the economic decisions of the private

sector, which could have lasting effects on the

economy. Therefore, the formation of a culture of

policy uncertainty must be avoided by encouraging

evidence based decision making and ensuring

consensus amongst decision makers before a

policy is adopted, while sufficient time for a policy

to operate must be allowed before a revision is

considered.

As highlighted above and also in numerous

occasions in the past, several existing and

emerging challenges need to be addressed

for the country to achieve high economic

growth and sustainable economic development

over the medium term and beyond. Whilst the

commitment of the government is essential to

implement the envisaged reforms, increased private

sector participation in productive economic activity

is also vital in the country’s progress as a middle

income economy. Proactive policy measures

implemented in a timely manner with increased

consistency and focus will enable effective and

sustainable utilisation of resources resulting in

an efficiency driven growth process, which would

facilitate improved welfare of the general public in

the country.
