FOREIGN CURRENCY BORROWINGS BY LICENSED BANKS

Foreign currency borrowings are an important source of funding for banks. However, excessive and unregulated foreign capital flows are likely to cause unwarranted macroeconomic and financial stability concerns in a country.

The Monetary Board introduces a policy framework for foreign currency borrowings of licensed banks with the objectives of addressing the high dependence on foreign currency borrowings and the resulting exposure of licensed banks to foreign exchange risk and minimising the pressure on the reserves and exchange rate of the country arising from large borrowings in foreign currency.

Accordingly, the Monetary Board issues Directions to licensed commercial banks (LCB) and licensed specialised banks (LSB) as follows:

Request for Extensions of the LankaSettle System after Business Hours

As you are aware, in terms of Rules 1.2 and 1.3 in the Volume 4 of the LankaSettle System Rules Version 2.1 issued in August 2013, the LankaSettle System is operated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) based on a fixed business schedule. Accordingly, Participants are required to complete all transactions by 4.30 p.m. on every business day. Further, a request for an extension for an operating day could be made by a LankaSettle Participant, only in a critical circumstance.

However, it was observed that some Participants have made requests from Payments and Settlements Department (PSD) of CBSL on several occasions in the past few months to extend the closure time of the LankaSettle System, particularly just before the scheduled time for closing the System without adhering to the said System Rules. These practices have caused greater inconvenience not only to the operations of the relevant departments of CBSL but also to other LankaSettle Participants as well. The relevant departments of CBSL are compelled to keep their systems on, until said transactions are completed.

Therefore, you are hereby advised not to make requests to extend business hours of LankaSettle System beyond the stipulated time in the Daily Operating Schedule other than in the event of unforeseen contingencies. In such instances, a written request to the Director, PSD has to be sent by an officer of the senior management of the Participant Institution before 4.00 p.m. of the respective business day with appropriate details in justifying the request.

8.2. CBSL will reserve to itself the right of accepting any portion of a bid or the whole of it and shall have the right of rejecting any or all bids without assigning any reason thereto.

At this auction CBSL determines the amount to be accepted under each series, the cut-off rate and the resultant auction Weighted Average Yield Rate (WAYR). CBSL is required to exercise all reasonable effort to accept the entire offered amount under Phase I subject to receipt of reasonable market bids at this round. Auction Participants are eligible to bid at this phase.

(ii) Notifying each bidder of its auction outcome under Phase I along with auction WAYR and amount available for bidding under Phase II through the issuance system.

Phase II: Opening of voluntary, volume based bidding for any under allocation subsequent to Phase I above. At this phase each Auction Participant could bid within the time duration specified under Item 10 of these Guidelines after the release of Phase I results. Issuance made at WAYR at this stage will be based on performance of each Auction Participant at Phase I and volume bid at Phase II. Auction Participants are eligible to bid at this phase.

Phase III: Issuance of the remaining volume (the difference between announced amount and aggregate allocated amount under Phase I and Phase II in each series), if any, on a mandatory basis at WAYR among PDs based on each such PD’s successful participation at Phases I and II. However, this phase will not be executed unless CBSL accepts 60% of the offered amount in minimum at Phase I. Issuance under this phase will be limited to PDs.

8.7. Accordingly, in the event the aggregate volume of the bids accepted at Phase I falling below the amount offered, Phase II of the issuance process will be open. The issuance process may further be extended to Phase III in the event of under allocation following Phase I and II against the amount offered at the Auction.

8.8. Aggregate issuances to each Auction Participant under Phase II and Phase III will be released through the issuance system. In addition, after the conclusion of Phase III, CBSL will issue a Press Release announcing aggregate results of issuances under all 3 phases.

* the maximum number of PDs that have been eligible to bid at primary auctions during the quarter concerned.

9.8. Authorized users of Auction Participants may place and/or, change their bids within the time window provided in Item 9.1 above. No party is allowed to make any changes to its bids once such time window expires.

Bids sent via email should originate through designated email IDs of Authorized Users whereas any fax containing bids shall be signed by Authorized Users. Auction Participants may verify delivery of bids by way of email or fax with CBSL using the designated contact telephone number/s.

Total amount payable at Phase IVolume to be issued under Phase II=×

Whereas Total amount payable by Auction Participant i at Phase I = ∑ Pij Vij, nj=1

n = number of successful bids of Auction Participant i at Phase I, Pij = bid price of the jth successful bid of Auction Participant i at Phase I, and Vij = Accepted bid volume of the jth successful bid of Auction Participant i at Phase I.

10.6 However, the actual amount that could be issued to an Auction Participant may vary on its offered volume under Phase II and volumes offered for subscription by other Auction Participants under Phase II.

i. If the aggregate of bids under Phase II exceeds the amount to be issued, allocation to each Auction Participant will be based on such Auction Participant’s performance at the competitive auction at Phase I (weighted by each Auction Participant ’s total payable amount in Phase I).

Scenario 1 - if the total volume bid by the sub-set of Active Auction Participants (an Active Auction Participant is any Auction Participant who has been issued any volume at the competitive auction in Phase I) is more than the volume available for issuance under Phase II, issuance under Phase II will be limited to Active Auction Participants only. Issuance to each such active Auction Participant through Phase II will be based on rounds of an iterative process. At Round 1, allocation to each Auction Participant will be the minimum of Ei calculated under Item 10.5 above and the volume bid under Phase II by the relevant Auction Participant. After end of allocation under Round 1, any remainder to be issued will be considered at Round 2 for further allocation under a similar iterative process executed at Round 1 considering Ei calculated under Item 10.5 and any remaining under allocated volume of the bidder under Phase II following allocation at Round 1. This process will continue until the entire amount available under Phase II is distributed among active Auction Participants. The total allocation to each active Auction Participant under Phase II will be the aggregate of issuances made at each round explained above. An example of Scenario 1 is exhibited at Annex A.

Scenario 2 - if the total volumes bid by the sub-set of active Auction Participants is less than the volume available for issuance under Phase II above entire sub set of Active Auction Participants will be allocated the total volume bid by each Active Auction Participant. The balance unallocated volume will be issued among the rest of the Auction Participants who bid under Phase II proportionate to the volume bid by each such Auction Participant at Phase II. An example of Scenario 2 is exhibited at Annex B.

ii. If the aggregate of bids under Phase II is less than the under allocated amount, all bids are accepted.

11. Mandatory Allocation under Phase III

11.1 For a given T-bond series, if the entire amount tendered at the issuance is not fully issued under Phase I and Phase II of the issuance process, Phase III is expected to execute electronically soon after the end of Phase II around 1430 hrs of the auction day, provided 60% of the offered amount in minimum is accepted at Phase I.

11.2 Issuance under Phase III will only be made to PDs.

11.3 Amounts to be issued under Phase III for each PD is determined as follows:

Mandatory issuance to Kth PD, PDk is given by :

PDk = × {total announced volume for the issuance - total volume issued under Phase I & II}M – Ak∑i=j M – Ain

where,

Total amount offered at auction - Total amount issued to Non PD Auction Participants at Phases I and II ,Total Number of PDs eligible to bid at the primary auction concernedM =

Ak = Amount issued to PDk at the Auction under Phases I & II above, n = Total number of PDs that secured less than M at the Competitive Auction at Phase I & II above and 1≤ k ≤ n

Accordingly, only those PDs who have failed to secure the average issuance volume per PD (ie. M) at Phases I and II above are subject to mandatory issuance at Phase III above.

AGRICULTURE SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT

1. Background

The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) at the meeting held on 20.05.2016 approved of implementation of the Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) Scheme under the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project (‘the Project’) by the CBSL on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL).

The PCG Scheme has been introduced as an innovative risk sharing tool under ‘the Project’ to be financed by the International Development Association (IDA) with a view to modernizing the Agriculture Sector in Sri Lanka. The development objective of the Project is ‘to support increasing agriculture productivity, efficiency, improving market access, and enhancing value addition of formal farmers, farmer groups, smallholder producer organizations, cooperatives, companies, producer associations and agribusinesses SMEs in the project areas’.

To achieve this objective, the Project will leverage investments from formal farmers, farmer groups, smallholder producer organizations, cooperatives, companies, producer associations and agribusinesses SMEs for higher value agriculture production and value addition. The Project will be supported via access to finance for such investments through Matching Grants1, technical assistance support, linkages to the commercial banking sector, and innovative risk sharing arrangements.

The Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs (MNPEA) is the anchor for the project. A Central Project Coordination Committee (CPCC) in the MNPEA provides overall policy oversight and guidance and project monitoring. The implementing agencies for the overall Project will be the Ministry of Primary Industries (MOPI) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The PCG Scheme will be operated by the Regional Development Department (RDD) of the CBSL, on behalf of the GOSL. The Director of the RDD is empowered with the authority to operate the PCG Scheme as the Administrator.

The main beneficiaries of this Project are formal farmers, farmer groups and smallholder producer organizations registered under the relevant government sectorial departments and agencies, cooperatives and companies registered under the Company Act, farmer producer associations registered under the relevant government sectorial departments and agencies and agri-business SMEs2, large companies registered under the Company Act, and individuals who are having creative/innovative business ideas on agricultural value chain development promoting commercial and export oriented agribusinesses and value addition.

2. Brief Introduction of the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project

2.1 The project includes three components namely:

• Component 1: Agriculture Value Chain Development

• Component 2: Productivity Enhancement and Diversification

• Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation

Component 1 will be implemented by the MOPI in line with the promoting and export oriented agriculture. Component 2 will be implemented by the MOA in support of the government’s National Food Production Programme. Component 3 will support the implementation of the first two components.

2.2 The objective of Component 1 is to “ promote commercial and export oriented agriculture through attracting and leveraging investments from smallholder producer organizations and agri-business enterprises for higher value agriculture production and value addition” This component will provide the enabling environment, incentives, and access to finance for such investment through matching grants, technical assistance support, linkages to the commercial banking sector, and innovative risk sharing arrangements.

2.3 The Component 1 includes the following sub-components:

• Sub-component 1.1: Investment Preparation Support

• Sub-component 1.2: Matching Grants to Producer Organizations and Agro-Businesses

• Sub-component 1.3: Partial Credit Guarantee for Agro-Business Financing

1 As part of the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project, Matching Grants targeting formal farmers, farmer groups, small holder producer organizations, cooperatives, companies, producer associations and agribusinesses SMEs will be given in order to attract and leverage investments from agriculture producers. These grants would co-finance investment proposals on a cost sharing basis; as per the terms of the Project. Eligibility criteria for producers to participate in the Matching Grant Program is as per the relevant Operations Manual issued by the Ministry of Primary Industries.2 Eligibility criteria for farmer producer organizations to participate in the Matching Grants Program would include: formal registration under the Company Act, at the time of application; appointment of an accountant; a minimum equity contribution by way of cash or in kind (however, excluding land); and availability of commercial financing of up to 40 percent of the total investment at current market rates.

3. Objectives of the Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) Scheme

3.1 The collateral requirements of banks can pose a serious challenge for farmers and agribusiness entrepreneurs when trying to source funding for business or farming. The proposed PCG Scheme targets to address the new and changing needs of intermediary financial service providers in areas such as portfolio concentration risks and the capital requirements for cushioning against lending risks to the agriculture sector. Accordingly, the PCG Scheme will focus on;

3.1.1 Increasing access to finance for formal farmers, farmer groups, smallholder producer organizations, cooperatives, companies, producer associations and agribusiness SMEs in the country;

3.1.2 Encourage Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to lend to the agriculture sector, thus promoting financial inclusiveness among farming communities;

3.1.3 Cover part of the default risk - a lender’s risk is lowered by guaranteed secure repayment of a part of the loan in case of default; and

3.1.4 Encourage longer term lending for asset acquisition where the loan term will be for several years and for larger loan amounts as compared to the currently existing guarantee schemes.

4. Eligibility requirement under the PCG Scheme

4.1 All loans given to projects benefiting from the Matching Grant Scheme under the Project are required to be registered under the PCG Scheme by the PFIs.

4.2 PCG is mandatory requirement under the Project.

5. Commencement of the PCG Scheme

5.1 The PCG Scheme comes into effect from the date of commencement of the Matching Grant Scheme implemented by the MOPI.

6. Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)

6.1 If a Licensed Commercial Bank or a Licensed Specialized Bank wishes to participate in the PCG Scheme of the Project, a written request should be sent to the Director of the RDD. The bank will be registered as a PFI under the PCG Scheme, subject to standard due diligence.

6.2 The list of PFIs registered under the Scheme is in Annex V.

7. Eligibility Criteria of Beneficiaries and Purposes

7.1 The loans eligible to apply for PCG are those loans for economically productive purposes in the agriculture industry as specified in the Matching Grant Manual issued by MOPI. These loans will be those that are partially funded via the Matching Grant Scheme of the Project3. It is important to bear in mind that the ultimate beneficiaries of the Project are formal farmers, farmer groups and organizations registered under relevant government sectorial departments and agencies, cooperatives and companies registered under the Company Act, farmer producer associations registered under the relevant government sectorial departments and agencies and agri-business SMEs, large companies registered under the Companies Act of Sri Lanka (in processing, trading, etc.).

7.2 Potential Agribusiness Themes and Priorities under the Project

A wide range of new and innovative technologies and institutional arrangements in improved produce quality, processing and marketing, production of value added agriculture products, food safety promotion and improvements, business management, income generating activities, new product development and provision of service would be eligible. Accordingly, the project proposals for agribusiness and demonstration activities could include a wide range of potential project themes which are indicated in Matching Grant Manuel issued by MOPI as follows.

7.2.1 Improvement of collection, storage and processing of agriculture products;

7.2.2 Improvement of grading/sorting, packaging, labeling, branding and presentation and promotion of products;

7.2.3 Improvement of product quality and standards, including introduction of production and processing technologies, best quality and food safety management practices/systems and product certification;

3 The loans backed by the PCG Scheme could also be extended to those which are not funded by the MGS.

10. Defaulted Loans

10.1 Branch managers should classify any default from formal farmers, farmer groups, smallholder producer organizations, cooperatives, companies, producer associations and agribusiness SMEs into two categories: Willful Defaulters and Non-Willful Defaulters. The classification should be made on the basis of information available to the manager through the field officers.

10.1.1 Willful Defaulters

If the available information indicates that the borrower/s had the capacity to repay but has failed to settle their obligations to the PFI, they should be classified as a willful defaulter.

10.1.2 Non-willful Defaulters

If a borrower has experienced difficulty in meeting their obligations to the PFI due to an adverse event such as floods, drought or pests or other specific reason that is beyond the control of borrower and acceptable to the Administrator, they should be classified as ‘non-willful defaulter’.

11. Loan Recoveries

11.1 The procedure for the recovery action in the case of these two categories is as follows;

11.1.1 Immediate action should be taken by the PFI to recover the dues from willful defaulters through legal action. Detailed steps in recovering the dues through legal action are mentioned in section 12.

11.1.2 In case of non-willful defaulters, PFIs should establish personal contacts with the borrower and offer the rescheduling facility, as mentioned in Section 15, to the borrower.

11.2 It is expected the PFI to take prompt and effective action for the recovery of any overdue amount in all possible ways. The Administrator expect the PFI to be active in the recovery of loans even after submission of a claim, and even after the receipt of the PCG from the Administrator. Thus, the PFI is obliged to carry out any action that may be suggested by Administrator.

11.3 The minimum requirements from the Administrator in this regard are as follows; When a loan is in arrears, the Branch Manager of the PFI should take immediate recovery actions with a view to persuading the borrower to pay up the loan, promptly. The actions may include the following:

11.3.1 To visit the borrower (minimum of 2 visits) to ascertain that the reasons for the non-payments, and persuade the borrower to repay the dues;

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017

Part III

Part III - 118

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

11.3.2 To ascertain and examine the difficulties faced by the borrower and recommend to the borrower course of actions to be followed by the borrower to overcome such difficulties

11.3.3 Where the difficulties are bona fide and beyond the control of the borrower, reschedule the loan and design a new instalment plan according to the borrower’s income pattern;

11.3.4 In the case of a willful defaulted borrower, issue a Notice of Demand on the borrower and the guarantors;

11.3.5 Where it is found that the loan proceeds have been misused, the Notice of Demand should be issued forthwith and steps should be taken immediately to institute legal action; and

11.3.6 Report willful defaulters to the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB)

12. Legal Action

12.1 If the PFI fails to collect the dues from defaulters even after taking the recovery actions mentioned in Section 11.3, such cases should be referred to the relevant judicial procedure as identified in Diagram 1, within 12 months from the due date of first installment in arrears.

13. Credit Guarantee Settlement

The Section 108A of the Monetary Law Act (Chapter 422), of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka empowers the CBSL to provide credit guarantees. Accordingly, the CBSL provides credit guarantee as a facilitation for the liquidity shortages that would arise due to the non-payment of expected loan repayment installments and hence, the PFIs should remit such credit guarantee settlement payments to the CBSL, once they recover dues from defaulters.

13.1 The Director, RDD has been empowered with the authority to collect premia, receive guarantee funds, invest guarantee funds if applicable under the existing standard prudential guidelines for investment of guarantee funds, pay guarantee claims and call for the recoveries after the settlement of claims etc.

13.2 Loans not covered under the PCG Scheme

13.2.1 Any loan for which the PFI has obtained a guarantee of the Government or any government institution is not eligible for credit guarantee cover under this PCG Scheme.

13.2.2 The loans for which credit guarantee premium has not been paid to the Administrator within the required time period are not eligible for obtaining facilities under this PCG Scheme.

13.3 Extent of Guarantee

13.3.1 The Scheme provides a guarantee cover of 50 per cent of the outstanding principal amount in loss or of the amount guaranteed whichever is lower. The credit guarantee claims will be paid in a single installment upon a PFI providing evidence of reaching the trigger points (identified as T in the Diagram 1)

13.3.2 The initial maximum guarantee cover is limited to a period of 5 years from the effective date of the PCG Scheme. However, the Administrator reserves the rights to extend the validity period of the guarantee scheme beyond the initial 5 years based on the performance of the Scheme in consultation with the implementing agencies of the Project.

13.4 Premium

13.4.1 The premium is payable to the Administrator at the rate of 0.5% p.a. on the eligible loans at the time of granting it, and it should be calculated on the total loan amount eligible under the Scheme. It should be paid at the initial time of granting of the loan guarantee.

13.4.2 Failure to pay the guarantee premium will negate the guarantee.

13.4.3 Each loan should have a separate guarantee application.

13.4.4 At each annual renewal, the premium of 0.5% p.a. is applied on the outstanding principal of the loan, given that loans under guarantee include term (multi-year) loans.

13.4.5 For multi-year term loans, the payment of the guarantee will be every 12 months followed by the initial time of granting of the loan guarantee.

The RDD will send these forms to Head Offices of all PFIs at the commencement of the Scheme.

13.5.2 A loan under the Scheme is deemed to be in loss after completion of the following steps;

13.5.2.1 Where the PFI has exhausted all the means available to recover the loan such as visiting the borrower to persuade him to repay the loan, invoking the assistance of guarantors where such guarantees have been taken and upon the issue of a Demand Notice to the borrower, the loan will be deemed to be in loss.

The records of such visits must be made available to the CBSL officials during inspection of PFIs, or on request/instructions by Administrator.

13.5.2.2 The PFI should serve the Notice of Demand on the borrower and on guarantors, where applicable. The PFI should also report the borrower to the CRIB, and should classify the loan as a default.

13.5.2.4 Accordingly, PFI should follow above steps and initiate appropriate legal action at the stipulated period, so that at the date of sending the credit guarantee claim the PFI has followed the applicable procedure for recovery of dues. Guarantee payment will be disbursed to the PFI that made the claim no later than 45 days after Administrator has received a valid claim request as specified in the OIs.

13.5.2.5 PFIs are strictly advised not to write off the loans for which credit guarantee has been paid under any circumstance, without the prior approval of the Administrator. The PFI should take all reasonable efforts to recover the loans even after the payment of credit guarantee.

13.5.2.6 In the case of a loan that is rescheduled and where the borrower fails to fulfill his obligations on the rescheduled loan, steps given in section 15 will have to be followed before a loan is considered to be in loss and a claim could be submitted.

13.5.2.7 On receipt of the claim form, the Administrator will pay 100 per cent of the Administrator’s liability subject to the right of recall of the same, if it is found later that the PFI had failed to exercise necessary supervision and actions as required or PFI had recovered the dues later.

14. Computation of Loss and Claim

For the purpose of computing the amount in loss, the principal outstanding amount as described in sub section 13.3.1 above is taken in to consideration.

15. Rescheduling the Loans of Non-Willful Defaulters

15.1 In the event a PFI decides to reschedule loans granted to borrowers whose default is due to factors beyond their control, and such decision is accepted by the appointed rescheduling committee, the decision should be informed to the Administrator.
