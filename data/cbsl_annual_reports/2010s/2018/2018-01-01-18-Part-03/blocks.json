A call option is an option to buy the underlying and a put option is an option to sell the underlying. Under this Direction EBs are eligible to issue options based on an underlying interest rate, currency and commodity.(c) Forward Rate Agreements (FRA) A forward rate agreement is an interest rate contract between two parties that allows an entity to position itself in the interest rate market. An FRA is a contract that calls for one party to make a fixed interest payment and the other party to make an interest payment at a rate to be determined at the contract expiration based on a notional principal amount.
