Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 3

The Central Bank was established as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of the monetary, financial and payment systems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act. In accordance with this Act, the Bank is charged with the responsibility of securing the core objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability.

The basis of accountability for the Central Bank and the success of its operations therefore would be the effectiveness of its policies and operations leading towards the achievement of its core objectives and not necessarily its profitability. These statutory objectives are the fundamental features that distinguish the Central Bank from any other entity, private or public. Accordingly, profitability related approach, if adopted by the Central Bank, could result in the Bank pursuing profits while compromising its core objectives, since it has the unique ability to create its own profits through its monetary policy activities, which could influence interest rates and exchange rates. It therefore

Central Bank of Sri LankaManagement StatementFor the period ended 31 December 2017

Accountability and the Financial Performance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in relation to the Objectives

follows that the Central Bank’s objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability need to be distinguished and detached from the pure profitability objective which should essentially be incidental or academic only.

In this background, the Central Bank’s financial statements record gains and/or deficits in the implementation of its monetary policy operations, exchange rate management, issuing of currency, etc. at the values as realized and hence, the financial performance as reported in these statements needs to be interpreted and understood in that context.

The Bank is subject to an external audit by the Auditor General under the Monetary Law Act sections 42 & 43. The Auditor General in turn has obtained the services of a firm of Chartered Accountants, M/s KPMG, to carry out an audit under International Standards of Auditing to ensure compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 11

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

1. REPORTING ENTITY AND STATUTORY BASE

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (“Bank” or “CBSL”) is an institution established under the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka as amended (“MLA”), as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka. The Bank is domiciled in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and situated at No: 30, Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 01.

These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Governor and Chief Accountant for and on behalf of the Monetary Board on 20th March 2018.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.1 Basis of Preparation

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for, gold and certain financial assets that have been measured at fair value as identified in specific accounting policies below.

2.1.1 Reporting Format

The Bank presents financial assets and financial liabilities, and their associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency activities. In the Statement of Financial Position, assets and liabilities are presented broadly in order of liquidity within such distinguished categories. The Bank considers that this reporting approach provides appropriate reporting of the Bank’s activities which are more fully described in Note 4.

2.1.2 Statement of Compliance

These financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Such financial statements are audited by the Auditor General and gazetted as required by the law. However, the amounts in gazetted financial statements would be different from these financial statements due to certain classification differences.

2.1.3 Currency of Presentation

The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (Rs.) and all the values are rounded to nearest Rupees thousands, except when otherwise indicated.

2.2 Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates

The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively.

Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are described in the following notes

2.2.1 Impairment of Loans and Receivables

The Bank reviews its individually significant loans and advances at each Reporting date to assess whether an impairment loss should be recorded in the Income Statement. The Bank’s impairment methodology for assets carried at amortised cost results in the recording of provisions for:

• Specific impairment losses on individually significant exposures;• Collective impairment of individually not significant exposures.

All categories include an element of management’s judgement, in particular for the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, the changing of which can result in different levels of allowances.

2.2.2 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefit

Plans

The cost of defined benefit plans is determined using an actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future compensation increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Assumptions used in the actuarial valuation are disclosed in note 29 to the Financial Statements.

2.2.3 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active markets,

Central Bank of Sri LankaNotes to the Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2017

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 12

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but if this is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values. The judgments include considerations of liquidity and model inputs such as volatility for longer–dated derivatives.

2.3 Foreign Currency Conversions

The Bank’s functional and presentation currency is Sri Lanka Rupees (Rs). Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency prevailing at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the Statement of Income. For the purposes of retranslation as at the reporting date the following Sri Lanka Rupee exchange rates for major currencies were used:

Currency2017Rs.2016Rs. 1 Australian Dollar119.3796108.23801 Canadian Dollar121.8598111.06171 Euro183.1353158.49591 Japanese Yen1.35801.28181 Special Drawing Rights (SDR)217.1608201.38111 Sterling Pound206.5221184.50871 United States Dollar152.8548149.80001 Chinese Yuan (Offshore)23.484721.4901

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using exchange rates at the dates of initial transactions.

2.4 Fair Value Measurement

The Bank measures financial instruments, such as, foreign securities, derivatives, and non-financial assets such as Gold, at fair value at each reporting date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 47.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Bank.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

2.5 Financial Assets and Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities, and the associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency activities. Foreign currency activities mainly arise from the Bank’s foreign reserves management function. Local currency activities mainly reflect the assets and liabilities associated with monetary policy implementation, issuing currency and banking activities.

The separate reporting of these activities is considered to provide a better presentation of the Bank’s financial position, financial performance and risk profile. The Bank considers that the combined reporting of foreign and local currency activities would weaken the informational value of the financial statements.

a. Financial Asset

The Bank classifies financial assets in one of the following categories:

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 13

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

• loans and receivables;• held-to-maturity;• available-for-sale; or• at fair value through profit or loss and within the category as: — held-for-trading; or

— designated at fair value through profit or loss.

b. Financial Liabilities

The Bank initially recognises all financial liabilities on the date that they are originated and classifies its financial liabilities as measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss or designated at fair value through profit or loss.

All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment. Subsequent measurement bases after initial recognition are described below. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the trade date respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

2.5.1 Securities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial assets classified as held for trading are included in the category “securities at fair value through profit or loss”. Upon initial recognition, attributable transaction cost are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. These securities are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market values are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the securities in the Statement of Financial Position while resulting gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Income.

Where the security is still owned, the gain or loss is reported as “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations”. Where the gain or loss has been realised (through selling the security), it is reported as “Gain / (Loss) from realised Price Revaluations”.

2.5.2 Available for Sale Investments

Available for sale investments are non-derivative investments that are designated as available for sale or are not classified as another category of financial assets. Available for sale investments comprise equity securities and debt securities.

Foreign currency available for sale investments are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market value are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the available for sale securities in the Statement of Financial Position.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the market value of foreign currency available for sale investments are recognised directly in equity (Other Comprehensive Income) which is shown under Other Reserves in the Statement of Financial Position until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported as equity is included in Statement of Income.

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

2.5.2.1 Equity Investments in financial and other institutions classified as Available for Sale

Unquoted equity securities whose fair value cannot be measured reliably are carried at cost. All other available for sale investments are measured at fair value after initial recognition.

2.5.3 Loans and Receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and that the Bank does not intend to sell immediately or in the near term.

Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus incremental direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at their amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.5.4 Held to Maturity

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, and which were not designated as fair value through profit or loss or as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2.5.5 Derivative Instruments

The Bank uses derivatives such as cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, for risk management purposes and not for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in ‘Gain / (Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations’.

When the transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, the bank immediately recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value ( a Day 1 difference) in ‘Gain / (Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations’. In cases where fair value is determined using data which

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 14

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

is not observable, the difference between the transaction price and model value is only recognised in the Statement of Income when inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

2.5.6 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Related Balances

The Bank transacts with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its own right rather than as the depository of the Government of Sri Lanka. All transactions by the bank with the IMF have been included in these financial statements on that basis.

The bank records the quota with the IMF as an asset and the amount payable to the IMF for quota is recorded as a liability of the bank. The cumulative allocation of SDRs by the IMF is treated as a liability. All the IMF related assets and liabilities are recognized at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Exchange gains and losses arising on revaluation of IMF assets and liabilities at the exchange rate applying at reporting date as published by the IMF are recognised in the Statement of Income.

All other charges and interest pertaining to balances with the IMF are recorded immediately in the Statement of Income.

2.5.7 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreign banks and financial institutions, short-term deposits and highly liquid financial assets with original maturities of less than three months, which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Bank in the management of its short-term commitments.

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the Statement of Financial Position.

As a part of local currency activities CBSL generates certain income and incurs expenses, which do not involve in movement of cash. Those activities result in certain assets and liabilities and mainly comprise of the transactions with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and transactions with domestic banks and financial institutions. Transactions with GOSL include the purchase of Treasury bills and bonds that are issued by the Government as a monetary policy mechanism. Such purchases, disposals or interest thereon are reflected as mere book entries in the records of CBSL. These are disclosed separately in Note 41 and Note 42 to these Financial Statements.

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues currency to the public in line with Monetary Law Act. Currency issued by CBSL represents a claim on the bank in favor of the holder. This is a liability on the part of the CBSL while it is an item of cash in the hands of the holder. Movement in circulation currency is included as part of financing activities in line with prevailing industry practices among those central banks which present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disburses cash in the form of notes and coins or cheques drawn on CBSL, to various drawees including suppliers and employees for goods and services obtained, which is either added to the currency in circulation liability or Deposits by banks and financial institutions. Such forms of utilization of currency for the purposes of CBSL’s payments form part of cash outflows of CBSL.

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of cash/ pay order outflows.

2.5.8 Repurchase and Reverse-Repurchase Transactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be recorded as assets in the Statement of Financial Position. The obligation to repurchase (Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase) is recognised as a liability. The difference between the sale and repurchase price in repurchase transactions and the purchase price and sale price in reverse-repurchase transactions represents an expense and income respectively and recognised in the Statement of Income.

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreements are recorded as an asset in the Statement of Financial Position (Securities Purchased under Agreements to Re-sell). Both repurchase and reverse-repurchase transactions are reported at the transaction value inclusive of any accrued income or expense.

2.5.9 Standing Deposit and Lending Facilities

With effect from 01 February 2014, Standing Deposit Facility (former Standing Repurchase (Repo) Facility) was converted in to a ‘clean deposit’ with no allocation of collateral. Hence, participating institutions invest their excess funds in the Standing Deposit Facility as a clean deposit on a daily basis at standing deposit facility rate.

The procedures of Standing Lending Facility (Formerly Standing Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Facility) are identical to the Standing Reverse Repurchase Facility.

2.5.10 CBSL Securities

The Bank issues CBSL Securities from time to time under its Monetary Policy operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities issued are recorded as a liability. The difference between the issue price and the face value is recorded as an expense in the Statement of Income.

2.5.11 Sri Lanka Government Securities

Sri Lanka Government Securities consists of Treasury bills purchased from GOSL. The portfolio is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at amortised cost.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 15

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

2.5.12 Provisional Advances to Government

Advances to Government represents direct provisional advances made to GOSL under Section 89 of the Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended. These advances are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

2.5.13 Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognised and carried at amortized cost less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An allowance for doubtful debts (for loan impairment) is established if there is objective evidence that the Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated recoverable amount. Bad debts are written off when identified.

2.5.14 Securities Borrowing and Securities Lending

Bank borrows Government Securities from time to time under its monetary policy operations from major institutional investors. The borrowed securities are used by the bank for repurchase operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities borrowings is an unconditional blanket guarantee from the Bank for return of securities, payment of agreed fee and on compensation at market rate ( as per the market rates communicated to the primary market participants by the Public Debt Department of the Bank) in events of any failure in delivery.

The market values of the securities borrowed and not used for the repurchase operations at a particular time are recorded as a contingent liability. The commission paid is expensed on accrual basis.

Transfer of securities to counterparties under lending transactions is only reflected on the Statement of Financial Position if the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred.

2.5.15 Staff Loans

Bank employees are entitled to loan facilities under concessionary interest rates. These loans which were granted from 2008 onwards are fair valued as per IAS 39 using discounted cash flows.

Discount rate - The rate compiled by the Economic Research Department of CBSL (ERD) based on the long term inflation target on USD –Commercial Interest Reference Rate (CIRR) plus 1 per cent added for the risk premium as agreed by the Audit Committee of the Bank is used as the discount rate and it varies with the period of the loans.

The difference between the present value of the staff loan as at the end of a year and beginning of the year have been amortized yearly to record the expense incurred by

the Bank in providing these loans at concessionary rates and equivalent amount is recorded as other income to record the income that would have been earned by the bank if these loans were granted at market rates.

Assumptions used for computation of fair valuation

• The date of staff loan granted is considered as 1 January.• There were no amendments or early settlements.

2.5.16 Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset is impaired.

If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in the Statement of Income.

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Income, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortized cost at the reversal date.

If an available for sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortization) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognized in profit or loss, is transferred from equity to the Statement of Income. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available for sale are not recognized in profit. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss, if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 16

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss.

2.5.17 Foreign Currency Term Liabilities

Foreign currency term liabilities are subsequently reported at the amortised cost of the liabilities. Changes in the value of these liabilities are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the term liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position. Gains and losses arising from changes in value of foreign currency term liabilities are recognised immediately in the Statement of Income.

Where the liability is still owed, the gain or loss is reported as Gain/(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluation. Where the gain or loss has been realised (through repayment of the liability), this is reported as Gains / (Losses) Realised from Price Changes.

2.5.18 Other Financial Assets and Liabilities

Local and foreign currency cash, deposits and short-term advances are recognised on trade date and measured at amortised cost

2.6 Other Assets and Liabilities

2.6.1 Gold

Section 67 (1) of the Monetary Law Act which specifies the composition of the International Reserve indicates that gold may be held by the CBSL as part of this Reserve. Section 67(2), Monetary Board is required to endeavor to hold at least a nuclear reserve in gold or currencies freely convertible by the Central Bank, whether directly or indirectly, in to gold as per the MLA. Hence, CBSL holds Allocated – Rs. 126.58 Bn and Un-Allocated – Rs. 15.28 Bn in gold as part of its International Reserves as at 31 December 2017. As this gold is part of the International Reserve and not used as a commodity which is traded during the normal course of business, gold is fair valued and the gains or losses are transferred to the Statement of Income. Prior to appropriation of profits, the unrealised gains from gold are transferred to the relevant reserve account.

2.6.2 Inventories

2.6.2.1 Currency Inventory

Inventories of the Bank include new currencies that are not yet issued to the circulation. Cost related to production and design of new currency notes and coins are initially recognized at cost. Cost of new currency notes and coins which are issued to the circulation is determined on a weighted average basis and at the time of issue it is charged to Statement of Income. Allowance is made for slow moving inventories.

2.6.2.2 Other Inventories

Other inventories are carried at lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

2.6.3 Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, Plant and Equipment excluding land & building are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of such Property, Plant and Equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. Land and buildings are measured at revalued amount, being their fair value at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Except for the freehold land, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives.

Class of AssetUseful Life

Buildings on Freehold LandOver 50 Years

Buildings on Leasehold landLower of 50 years or over the lease hold period.

Plant & Plant Integrals 20 Years

Furniture & Equipment 10 Years

Motor Vehicles5 Years

Motor Vehicles acquried 2014 onwards10 Years

Computer Hardware 4 Years

Others3 Years

The carrying values of Property, Plant and Equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Policy for revaluation of Land & Building of the bank is at least once in five years or at any shorter interval when a significant valuation adjustment becomes evident. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the Revaluation Reserve included in the equity section of the Statement of Financial Position, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in Statement of Income, in which case the increase is recognized in Statement of Income. A revaluation deficit is recognized in Statement of Income, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the Revaluation Reserve. Upon disposal, any revaluation surplus relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.

An item of Property, Plant and Equipment is de-recognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Income in the year the asset is de-recognized. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, regularly.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 17

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalisation.

2.6.4 Intangible Assets

Computer software not integral to computer hardware are shown as intangible assets and recognized at cost. Following initial recognition these intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment.Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.Amortisation is recognised in income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful life of 4 years, from the date that it is available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.

2.6.5 Other AssetsOther assets are carried at expected realisable values.

2.6.6 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each end of reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the bank makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in income statement.

2.6.7 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Bank expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

2.6.8 Currency in Circulation

Currency issued by the CBSL represents a claim on the bank in favour of the holder. The liability for Currency in Circulation is recorded at face value in the Statement of Financial Position.

2.6.9 Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans

Pension and other Post Employment Benefit Plans operated by the bank are disclosed in Note 29.

2.6.10 Defined Benefit Plans

A defined benefit plan is a post employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. Bank operates defined benefit schemes for Pension, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pensions (W&OP), Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pensions (WR&OP), Retirement Gratuity and Post Employment Medical Benefits. The Bank and eligible beneficiaries make contributions, to separately administered funds in respect of the first three schemes.

The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.The Bank’s obligation in respect of defined benefit plan is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the valuation date on Government Bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the average remaining years of service. All principal actuarial assumptions disclosed in Note 29 are revised only when a full actuarial valuation is performed.

2.6.11 Defined Contribution Plans

Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. The bank contributes 24% and 3% of employees’ gross emoluments to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively which are separately administered defined contribution plans.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as expense in the Statement of Income as and when they arise.

2.6.12 Grants

Grants recognised at their fair value (where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions, if any, will be complied with) are shown under equity. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised in the Statement of Income over the periods necessary to match them to the expenses it is intended to compensate on a systematic basis. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred government grant account and is released to the Statement of Income over the expected useful life of the relevant asset on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy of the related asset.

2.6.13 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where the transfer of

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 18

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

economic benefit is not probable or cannot be reliably measured. All guarantees of indebtedness, forward foreign exchange transactions and other commitments, which are not recognized in Statement of Financial Position, are shown under respective headings disclosed as Contingent Liabilities and Commitment items. Where applicable, such amounts are measured at best estimates.

2.7 Income Statement

Revenue & Expenses

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the bank and the revenue can be reliably measured. Expenses are recognised in the Statement of Income on the basis of a direct association between the cost incurred and the earning of specific items of income. All expenditure incurred in the running of the business and in maintaining the property, plant & equipment in a state of efficiency has been charged to income in arriving at the result for the year.

The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expenses are recognised:

2.7.1 Interest Income and Expenses

Interest income and expense are recognised in the Statement of Income for all interest bearing instruments on an accrual basis using the effective yield method based on the actual purchase price unless collectability is in doubt. Interest income includes coupons earned on fixed income investments and securities and accrued discount and premium on treasury bills and other discounted instruments. Interest income is suspended when loans become doubtful of collection. Such income is excluded from interest income until received.

2.7.2 Dividends

Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive the payment is established.

2.7.3 Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.

Net gains and losses of a revenue nature on the disposal of Property, Plant & Equipment have been accounted for in the Statement of Income, having deducted from proceeds on disposal, the carrying amount of the assets and related selling expenses.

Gains and losses arising from incidental activities to the main revenue generating activities and those arising from a group of similar transactions which are not material, are aggregated, reported and presented on a net basis.

2.7.4 Personnel Expenses

Personnel Expenses include the full cost of all staff benefits. Salaries and related expenses due at year-end are included in other local payables. 2.7.5 Operating Leases

All the lease rentals on the operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease

2.7.6 Taxation

The income of the bank is exempted from tax under section 118 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 as amended. Further Bank is exempted from ESC as per the Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Act, No 6 of 2013 and exempted from Value Added Tax on supply of financial services as per Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act No.17 of 2013.

3. STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective which are applicable to the Bank, up to the date of issuance of the Bank’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Bank intends to adopt these standards, when they become effective.

3.1 IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”

IFRS 9, issued in July 2014, is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. It replaces IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”.

The Bank has completed the initial assessment of the potential impact on its financial statements for the year ended 31st December 2016 resulting from the application of IFRS 9 with the assistance of an external consultant. Based on assessments undertaken to date, the total estimated adjustment of the adoption of IFRS 9 based on balances as at 31st December 2016 are as follows,

• a reduction of approximately 1.5% - 3% of the net profit, related to impairment requirements.• an increment of approximately 5% - 8% of net assets, related to classification and measurement requirements, other than impairment.

The above assessment is preliminary because not all transition work has been finalised. The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 as at 1st January 2018 may change because;

• IFRS 9 will require the Bank to revise the accounting process and internal controls and these changes are not yet fully complete, and

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 19

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

• The new accounting policies, assumptions, judgements and estimation techniques employed are subject to change until the Bank finalises its first financial statements for the year ending 31st December 2018 that include the date of initial application.

Classification of Financial Assets

IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics.

IFRS 9 includes three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortized cost, Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). It eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held for trading, held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale.

Amortized cost

A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:

• it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and• its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

A financial asset is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL

• it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets• its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL.

Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in the scope of IFRS 9 are not separated. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification.

Impact Assessment-Classification

The standard will affect the classification and measurement of financial assets held as at 1 January 2018 as follows,

• Trading assets and derivative assets held for risk management, which are classified as held-for-trading and measured at FVTPL under IAS 39, will also be measured at FVTPL under IFRS 9,

• Loans and advances to banks and to customers that are classified as loans and receivables and measured at amortized cost under IAS 39 will in general also be measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9,

• Held-to-maturity investment securities measured at amortized cost under IAS 39 will in general also be measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9,

• Debt investment securities that are classified as available-for-sale under IAS 39 may, under IFRS 9, be measured at amortized cost, FVOCI or FVTPL, depending on the particular circumstances

• The majority of the equity investment securities that are classified as available-for-sale under IAS 39 will be measured at FVTPL under IFRS 9. However, some of these equity investment securities are held for long-term strategic purposes and will be designated as at FVOCI on 1 January 2018.

Impairment – Financial assets, Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts

IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking ‘expected credit loss’ model. This will require considerable judgment over how changes in economic factors affect Expected Credit Losses (ECLs) which will be determined on a probability-weighted basis.

The new impairment model applies to the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL:

• Financial assets that are debt instruments• loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts issued (previously, impairment was measured under IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” )

Under IFRS 9, no impairment loss is recognized on equity investments

IFRS 9 requires a loss allowance to be recognized at an amount equal to either 12-month ECLs or lifetime ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument, whereas 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.

Definition of default

CBSL has assessed the definition of default by considering the IFRS 9 definition of “credit impaired” which includes:

• Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;• A breach of contract, such as a default or a past due event;

• The lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider;• It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization;• The disappearance of an active market for the financial asset because of financial difficulties; or• The purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.

The definition of default that CBSL adopts is largely similar to the definition of default used by Independent Rating Agencies such as Moody’s, S&P and Bloomberg.

Significant increase in credit risk

Under IFRS 9, when determining whether the credit risk (i.e. risk of default) on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Bank will consider downgrading of external credit rating below the investment grade or based on the concept of rating downgrade leading to doubling Probability of Default.

The key inputs into the measurement of ECLs are likely to be the term structures of the following variables

— Probability of Default (PD)— Loss given default (LGD)— Exposure at default (EAD)

These parameters will be derived from internally developed statistical models and other historical data that leverage regulatory models. They will be adjusted to reflect forward-looking information as described below.

Probability of Default (PD)PD estimates are estimates at a certain date, which will be extracted and calculated using market data and statistical models tailored to the various categories of counterparties and exposures.

Loss given default (LGD)LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The LGD models will consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset.

Exposure at default (EAD)EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank will derive the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract, including amortization, and prepayments. The EAD of a financial asset will be the gross carrying amount at default.

Forward-looking information

Under IFRS 9, the Bank will incorporate forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since

initial recognition and its measurement of ECLs. The Bank will formulate a ‘base case’ view of the future direction of relevant economic variables and a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios by considering a variety of external actual and forecast information.

Classification – Financial Liabilities

IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the classification of financial liabilities. However, under IAS 39 all fair value changes of financial liabilities designated as FVTPL are recognized in profit or loss, whereas under IFRS 9 these fair value changes will generally be presented as follows,

• the amount of the change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability will be presented in OCI; and• the remaining amount of the change in the fair value will be presented in profit or loss

Transition

Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 will generally be applied retrospectively.

3.2 IFRS 16 “Leases”

The IASB issued the new standard for accounting for leases - IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. The new standard does not significantly change the accounting for leases for lessors. However, it does require lessees to recognise most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, with the corresponding rightof- use assets. Lessees must apply a single model for all recognised leases, but will have the option not to recognise ‘short-term’ leases and leases of ‘low-value’ assets. Generally, the profit or loss recognition pattern for recognised leases will be similar to today’s finance lease accounting, with interest and depreciation expense recognised separately in the statement of income.

IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted provided the new revenue standard, IFRS 15, is applied on the same date. Lessees must adopt IFRS 16 using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.

The Bank does not anticipate early adopting IFRS 16 and is currently evaluating its impact.

3.3 IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”

In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective for periods beginning on 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted. IFRS 15 defines principles for recognizing revenue and will be applicable to all contracts with customers. However, interest and fee income integral to financial instruments and leases will continue to fall outside the scope of IFRS 15 and will be regulated by the other applicable standards (e.g., IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 16 Leases).

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 21

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Revenue under IFRS 15 will need to be recognised as goods and services are transferred, to the extent that the transferor anticipates entitlement to goods and services. The standard will also specify a comprehensive set of disclosure requirements regarding the nature, extent and timing as well as any uncertainty of revenue and corresponding cash flows with customers.

The Bank does not anticipate early adopting IFRS 15 and is currently evaluating its impact.

4. NATURE AND EXTENT OF ACTIVITIES

The Monetary Board of the CBSL is, in addition to determining the policies or measures authorized to be adopted or taken under Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 as amended, vested with the powers, duties and functions of the CBSL and are generally responsible for the management, operations and administration of the Bank. The Bank is primarily responsible for the administration, supervision, regulation of monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka and also acts as the fiscal agent of the Government. The activities of the bank mainly include:

• Implementing monetary and exchange rate polices.

• Issuing of currency.

• Facilitating free competition and stability in the financial system.• Licensing and supervision of defined financial institutions.

• Organization and management of the inter-bank settlement system and promotion of the smooth functioning of the payment system.

• Providing loans and advances to the Government, bank and financial institutions under various facilities.

• Acting as a depository of the Government under specific arrangements with Government and agencies acting on behalf of the Government.

The activities carried out in order to achieve its objective of economic, price and financial system stability with a view to encouraging and promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka can be broadly segregated into foreign currency and local currency activities. Results of these activities are taken to mean Operating Activities in the context of the Statement of Income.

4.1 Foreign Currency Activities

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the CBSL’s holdings of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserves management function. The foreign reserves management portfolio comprises foreign currency assets held for foreign exchange intervention purposes and other foreign currency assets held for trading purposes.

The foreign currency assets are held in various currencies. The majorities are denominated in United States Dollars, Australian Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen

and New Zealand Dollars. The financial instruments held within these foreign currency portfolios consist mainly of sovereign securities, securities held under reverse-repurchase transactions or balances held with other central banks, commercial banks and custodial institutions.

The CBSL also holds, from time-to-time, foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from international market operations.

4.2 Local Currency Activities

Local currency activities arise as follows:

(i) Liquidity management operations: Liquidity management largely involves the CBSL offsetting the daily net flows to or from government or market by advancing funds to or withdrawing funds from the banking system. Most of this business is undertaken through daily open market operations.

(ii) Holding an investment portfolio comprising Sri Lanka government securities to support the liability for currency in circulation. The bank’s policy is to hold these investments for monetary operations and not for trading.

4.3 Trust and Custodial Activities

Amounts administered by the CBSL under custodial and administration arrangements are not included in these financial statements, as they do not form part of elements of financial statements of the Bank.

7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

7.1 The table below shows the fair values of derivative financial instruments, recorded as assets or liabilities, together with their notional amounts. The notional amount, recorded gross, is the amount of derivative’s underlying asset, reference rate or index and is the basis upon which changes in the value of derivatives are measured. The notional amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at period end and are indicative of neither the market risk nor the credit risk.

7.2 The above derivatives consisting of Currency Swaps, Currency Options and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts were used for the purpose of managing market and liquidity risks in international reserves held by the Bank in line with the statutory objectives of maintenance of international reserves. In addition, the Bank entered into Swap transactions with Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), Licensed Specialized Banks (LSBs) and Foreign Central Banks in order to maintain international stability of the Sri Lankan Rupee, to strengthen the financial system of the country and to encourage those Banks to bring foreign funds.

7.3 Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financial instruments prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and indices.

7.4 A significant part of derivatives portfolio of the Bank consists of currency swaps entered into as a strategy to manage the short term liquidity requirements. In a currency swap, the Bank pays/receives a specified amount of a currency on an agreed date in exchange of another currency at agreed rates.

7.5 From Foreign Exchange Forward contracts, the Bank gets the obligation to buy or sell specific amount

of foreign currency on an agreed future date at an agreed rate.

7.6 The Bank’s exposure to derivative contracts is closely monitored as part of the overall risk management of the Bank to ensure expected benefits from such derivatives are crystalized to the Bank.

Total IMF Related Assets126,838,152117,008,340

8.1 Holding of Special Drawing Rights

Holding of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is potentially a claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members, in that holders of SDRs can exchange their SDRs for these currencies. The SDRs value as a reserve asset derives from the commitments of members to hold and accept SDRs, and to honor various obligations connected with the operation of the SDR system. The IMF ensures that the SDRs claim on freely usable currencies is being honored in two ways: by designating IMF members with a strong external position to purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions, and through the arrangement of voluntary exchanges between participating members in a managed market. The amount shown above represents the total holding of the Bank as at the respective reporting dates.

8.2 IMF Quota

The IMF Quotas (capital subscriptions) are the primary source of IMF resources received from its member countries. Each country’s quota is determined broadly on the basis of the relative economic size of the country. Upon joining the IMF, a country must pay 25 per cent of its quota in widely accepted foreign currencies or SDRs, and the remaining 75 per cent in its own currency. The IMF quota represents an asset of the Bank as it transacts with the IMF on its own account on behalf of the Government as per Articles of the IMF.

The IMF, based on the General Quota Review Agreement, decided to increase the quotas of each of the IMF’s 189 members in January 2016. As a result, Sri Lanka’s IMF quota increased to SDR 578.80 Mn on 17 February 2016 from the previous quota amount of SDR 413.40 Mn.

The amounts payable in respect of the IMF Quota is shown under the heading Quota Liability in Note 20. A member’s quota determines that country’s financial and organizational relationship with IMF, including:

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017Part II - 23

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

(i) Subscriptions: A member’s subscription to IMF resources is equal to its quota and determines the maximum amount of financial resources the member is obliged to provide to the IMF. A member must pay its subscription in full; up to 25 per cent must be paid in reserve assets specified by the IMF (SDRs or usable currencies), and the rest in the member’s own currency.

(ii) Voting power: The quota defines a member’s voting power in IMF decisions. IMF member’s votes are comprised of basic votes plus one additional vote for each SDR 100,000 of quota. The 2008 reform fixed the number of basic vote at 5.50 per cent of total votes.

(iii) Access to financing: The amount of financing a member can obtain from the IMF (access limits) is based on its quota. Under Stand-By and Extended Arrangements, for instance, a member can currently borrow up to 145 per cent of its quota annually and 435 per cent cumulatively. Access may be higher in exceptional circumstances.

(iv) SDR allocations: Members’ shares of SDR allocations are established in proportion to their quotas.

8.3 Deposits with IMF – PRGF – HIPC Trust Deposit

The PRGF – HIPC (Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Trust Deposit was made under the agreement between the GOSL and the IMF on 21 April 2000 by transferring SDR 788,783 from Sri Lanka’s deposit in the post SCA-2 (Special Contingent Account) administered account with the IMF. This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly, GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA –2 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018.

20.1 Interest bearing Loans consist of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and Stand By Arrangement (SBA) obtained from the IMF.

20.2 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) is a three year facility provided by the IMF to support the Balance of Payments and Government’s economic reform agenda. The IMF approved the EFF of SDR 1.10 Bn (approximately USD 1.50 Bn) in June 2016. This amount is equivalent to 185 per cent of the country’s current quota with the IMF. The first tranche under the EFF amounting to SDR 119.89 Mn (approximately USD 168.10 Mn) was made available in June 2016. The second tranche to the value of SDR 119.89 Mn (approximately US dollars 162.56 Mn), third tranche to the value of SDR 119.89 Mn (approximately USD 167.2 Mn) and the fourth tranche to the value of SDR 177.77 Mn (approximately USD 251.4 Mn) were disbursed in November 2016, July 2017 and December 2017, respectively. With the disbursement of the fourth tranche, a total of USD 759.9 Mn has been received thus far by Sri Lanka on account of EFF. The remaining amount is expected to be disbursed in three more tranches over a period of two years, with the final tranche expected in April 2019. The interest rate applicable on the EFF comprise of the basic rate of charge, which is equivalent to the SDR interest rate (currently stands at 0.05 per cent per annum) plus 100 basis points.

20.3 Stand By Arrangement (SBA) is a balance of payment support financing facility provided by the IMF subject to certain conditions on macroeconomic management

of the borrowing countries. The IMF approved a SBA facility of SDR 1.65 Bn (USD 2.60 Bn) for Sri Lanka in July 2009 as a balance of payment support. The SBA was successfully completed in 2012 with the final tranche received in July 2012. This loan facility is repayable within 5 years and the repayments commenced in October 2012. The rate of interest payable is composed of two components; the service charge and a fixed margin. The service charge is calculated weekly, based on the SDR interest rate. The fixed margin is 1 per cent per annum for the outstanding loan amount up to 300 per cent of the quota with the IMF. When the outstanding loan amount exceeds 300 per cent of the quota, a surcharge of 2 per cent per annum will be levied on the outstanding in excess of 300 per cent. The first repayment of SDR 25.80 Mn was made on 25 October 2012.

Total amount of SDR 1,455.52 Mn of repayments were done during the years 2013-2016 and the outstanding balance as at 31st December 2016 was SDR 172.25 Mn which was repaid during the period from January to July 2017. As at 31 December 2017, there is no outstanding balance for SBA facility.

20.4 The Special Drawing Right (SDR) is a reserve asset created by the IMF in order to meet a long-term global need to supplement existing reserve assets. SDRs are allocated to member countries in proportion to their IMF quotas. SDR allocations can only be made to countries that participate in the IMF’s SDR Department (an accounting unit within the IMF). The IMF created SDRs to supplement existing official reserve assets such as gold holdings, foreign exchange and reserve positions in the IMF. Under certain conditions, which are set in the Articles of Agreement signed on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka by the Bank, the IMF may allocate SDRs to members in proportion to their IMF quotas. An allocation of SDRs by the IMF provides each member with a costless asset on which interest is neither earned nor paid. The Articles of Agreement also allow for cancellations of SDRs, but to date, this provision has not been used. Increases in Allocation of SDR represents increases in Holding of SDR as

29. PENSION AND OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Bank operates six defined benefit plans which cover all eligible employees. Under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Scheme (old), employees who joined the Bank prior to 1 January 1998 and complete 10 years of service become eligible to the schemes. The employees who have joined the Bank after 1st January 1998 and complete 10 years of service become eligible for the new pension scheme. These Pension Schemes are non-contributory pension schemes where the cost of the benefits is wholly borne by the Bank. The Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for male employees and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for female employees are open to employees of the Bank who had joined prior to 1 January 1998. Eligible Employees under these plans who were recruited before 1 August 1994 contribute 5% of the monthly basic salary & employees who were recruited on or after 01 August 1994 10% of the monthly basic salary.

The Bank also provides gratuity benefits to employees who have completed five years of service in the Bank and who are not eligible for a monthly pension payment under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes. In order to meet this liability, a provision is carried forward in the Statement of Financial Position, equivalent to the liability calculated using the actuarial valuation.

The Bank has a Post-Employment Medical Benefit Scheme which provides reimbursement of certain medical expenses incurred by retired employees on account of themselves or their spouses and by widows/widowers.

The Bank employed an Independent Actuary M/s K. A. Pandit, Consultant & Actuary (Mumbai) to re-assess the defined benefit obligations and the current service costs attributable to the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme during the year.

Funds of the Employee Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme are managed separately and separate books are maintained. However, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme are not separated from the books of accounts of the Bank. Further, investments and investment income are recorded separately for these funds in the Bank books and the income earned from the investments are transferred back to these funds and reinvested without being distributed.

The total fair value of plan assets of Rs. 40,816.60 Mn (2016 – Rs. 36,145.06 Mn) exceeds the total present value of all benefit obligations of Rs. 38,392.29 Mn (2016 – Rs. 36,065.09 Mn) at the end of the reporting period resulting in a surplus of Rs. 2,424.31 Mn (2016 – Rs. 79.97 Mn)

The balance shown under Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans in Statement of Financial Position differs from the net liability as per the actuary due to the following reasons:a) The net asset position of the Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme are not reflected in the accounts due to the remote possibility of distributing any residual balance of the fund to the bank.b) For both gratuity and medical benefit schemes, the accounts represent the gross liability position and not the net liability as per actuary, since the Bank does not keep relevant assets in a separate fund (internally maintained). There are uncollateralized investments under Pension, Widows’ and Orphans’ fund, Widowers’ and Orphans’ fund, Gratuity and Medical Benefit Scheme fund worth of Rs. 485.79 Mn for which 100% provision has been made and thus not included in the value of plan assets. Even without the value of such investments, bank has a net asset position under its pension liability as per actuarial valuation.

Miscellaneous liabilities and accruals include the balances payable in the accounts payable, contract retention, deposits taken as refundable tender deposits and the penalties payable by the Exchange Control Department.

31. EQUITY

Nature of Equity Items

31.1 Capital Funds

Contributed Capital - The capital account represents the capital of the Bank in accordance with section 6 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA). As per the section 6 of the MLA (Amendment) Act No. 15 of 2014, the capital of the Bank has been increased to Rs. 50 Bn. Accordingly, Bank has increased its capital up to Rs. 50 Bn by capitalizing the Bank’s reserves with the concurrence of Minister of Finance in September 2014.

31.2 Fixed Asset Revaluation Reserve – This reserve is made up of the revaluation surpluses of Property, Plant and Equipment as per IAS 16.

31.3 Other Reserves comprise the following;

i). International Revaluation Reserve (IRR) : International Revaluation Reserve is a reserve established in accordance with section 41 of the Monetary Law Act which requires that any unrealised gain or loss arising from the revaluation of net assets and liabilities of CBSL in gold or foreign currency shall not be considered in computing the net profit of the Bank, instead such profit or loss should be transferred to the IRR.

ii). Market Revaluation Reserve (MRR): Market Revaluation Reserve was set up as per the Monetary Board decision of 30 January 2003, to transfer the price valuation gains from marking to market the foreign assets, in order to meet any adverse effects of volatilities in the international markets leading to adverse movements in market prices of the foreign financial assets. The Monetary Board has decided to build up this reserve to a maximum of 10% of the gross foreign reserves of the Bank.

Further, as per the Monetary Board decision MB/DG (W)/7/1/2016 dated 29 February 2016 on proposed amendments to the Profit Distribution Policy of the Bank, where Monetary Board deems necessary, transfer may be made from the MRR to Retained Earnings, in the case of negative Retained Earnings due to significant unrealized marked to market losses.

Accordingly, an amount of Rs.4.65 Bn has been transferred to Retained Earnings from MRR in view of improving the negative Retained Earnings of the Bank which has resulted mainly due to the accumulation of

significant unrealized marked to market losses in the past years.

Considering the subsequent marked to market gains, an amount of Rs. 14.03 bn was transferred to MRR from Retained Earnings in 2017 as per the Monetary Board decision BP MB/F/7/21/2017 dated 20 February 2017.

iii). Other Reserves : Other reserves include General Reserve, Building Reserve and Credit Guarantee Reserve. General Reserve includes the amounts set a side from the retained earnings by the Monetary Board.

iv). Net Fair Value Gain/(Loss) on Available for Sale Securities : Unrealized gains and losses on the revaluation of securities and unit investments designated as available for sale are transferred to this reserve.

v). RTGS Sinking Fund : This fund is built up with the charges collected from the participants for the use of the RTGS system.

vi). Pension Fund Reserve : This reserve is made up by transferring an additional Rs.3 Bn from 2007 profits to be used to meet any shortfalls in the pension fund given the vulnerability of the income generating capacity of the Bank to external risks. Another Rs. 1 Bn have been transferred to this reserve from 2011 profits. During June 2015, Rs. 2 Bn has been transferred from Pension Fund Reserve to New Pension Liability Account to implement the new pension scheme as per Board Paper No: MB/HR/11/12/2015.

vii). Technical Advancement Reserve : This reserve is built up from 2007 profits specifically to be used for technical advancement requirements, modification or upgrading of the IT systems currently used by the Bank i.e., General Ledger, RTGS,Treasury Management System and Scriptless Securities Settlement System.

viii). Provincial Development Credit Scheme : During 2010, the Bank has commenced a refinance credit scheme for medium & long term development purposes for provinces by creating a fund from the profits, amounting to Rs.2.90 Bn. Such loans are granted through Bank of Ceylon & People’s Bank.

ix). Special Credit Guarantee Scheme Reserve : This reserve was set up in the year 2014 by transferring Rs. 2 Bn from Medium and Long Term Credit Fund, of which Rs. 1 Bn is allocated to support restructure of Saubaghya Loan Scheme, Awakening North Loan Scheme (phase II), Resumption of Economic Activities in the East (phase II) and Repair of Damaged Houses in North and East operated by Regional Development Department of the Bank. The balance of Rs. 1 Bn is allocated to implement a special credit guarantee scheme to support lending to Small and Medium Enterprises by Commercial Banks.

45. RISK MANAGEMENT

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has two statutory objectives, i.e., economic and price stability and financial system stability. The CBSL has been assigned with wide statutory powers to implement economic and financial policies to secure its objectives. The Monetary Board, the Governing Board of the CBSL is responsible for making all policy decisions related to the management, operations and administration of the Bank. The CBSL’s operations and policies are not aimed towards generating profits. However, it is exposed to a number of risks in the course of carrying out its functions. Therefore, the bank’s management ensures that strong and effective risk management and control systems are in place. In this regard, the Monetary Board has delegated the task of risk management to departments and committees with a view to

ensure effective management and control of risks. Therefore, risk management is a responsibility of all levels of decision making at the CBSL.

Managing risks at the CBSL is conducted under a ‘Three Lines of Defense’ model. Accordingly, the responsibility of the ‘First Line of Defense’ rests with the respective departments. The risks coming under the ‘First Line of Defense’ are operational in nature, so that such risks are managed by departments where they are originated. The ‘First Line of Defense’ would ensure proper internal risk management systems and controls are in place. The Risk Management Department (RMD) as the ‘Second Line of Defense’ is responsible for assessing, controlling and monitoring

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

of financial risks and independently reporting to the Governor. Internal Audit Department is entrusted with the responsibility of performing the risk assurance function as the ‘Third Line of Defense’.

The two major dimensions of risks are financial risks and non-financial risks. Financial Risk includes market risk (interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The RMD carries out risk assessments, monitoring and reporting of financial risks relating to the CBSL’s foreign reserves portfolio while the International Operations Department (IOD) of the CBSL manages the foreign reserves portfolio. A comprehensive set of guidelines incorporating risk mitigation policies are followed by IOD in managing reserves portfolio. Financial risk assessments relating to international reserves are independently reported to the Governor and the Monetary Board.

Interest rate risk or the exposure of the Bank’s foreign assets portfolio to movements in the interest rate is monitored through modified duration of the portfolio as well as Value at Risk (VaR) for a time horizon of 10 days and a confidence level of 99 per cent. The foreign exchange risk or the capital loss as a consequence of fluctuations in the exchange rates is managed mainly through diversification of investment currencies. In order to mitigate liquidity risk, limits to assets classes, a maximum purchasing limit over total amount issued by the issuers of the securities are considered in the Strategic Assets Allocation (SAA). In the management of foreign reserves, minimizing liquidity risk is the prime consideration in order to maintain an effective foreign exchange intervention capability. Policies for managing the credit, interest rate, foreign exchange and liquidity risks are outlined in sections 45.1, 45.2, 45.3, 45.4 and 45.5 respectively.

A Counterparty Credit Risk Management System (CCRMS) is used to manage the credit risk of the foreign assets portfolio based on the credit ratings of the investments and the counterparties. In addition, Money Market Counterparties’ Credit Default Swaps (CDS) /Stock prices are monitored by the RMD on a continuous basis.

Assessing, monitoring and reporting of financial risk pertaining to investments by internal investment funds of the Central Bank also carries out by the RMD. Internal Investment Fund of the CBSL is currently managed under the Finance Department as the “Front Office” and the RMD monitors the risks pertaining to the investments of the internal fund on an ongoing basis. RMD submits status reports of the fund independently to the Governor on an ongoing basis, provides Finance Department with risk related inputs to improve the Investment Process and Investment Policy Statement, etc., to ensure capital preservation and the adequacy of liquidity of the fund at all times.

Non-Financial risk includes legal risk, compliance risk, human resource risk, fraud risk, strategic and policy risk and other operational risks etc. Monitoring non-financial risk would ensure a risk compliance of work procedures, rules and guidelines as well as proper risk governance of the bank. In view of the above, 17 selected departments submit their non-financial risk profiles to RMD on periodic basis, and information submitted by these departments are compiled and analyzed by RMD and presented to the senior management.

The internal controls and the risk management processes are audited annually by the Internal Audit Department (IAD) of the Bank. It examines the adequacy of the procedures and the Bank’s compliance with the procedures. All departments are subject to periodic internal audit review. The IAD reports administratively to the Governor who is the chairman of the Monetary Board and functionally to the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (AAC).

AAC is chaired by an appointed member of the Monetary Board. AAC advises the Monetary Board on matters relating to the integrity of the financial statements of the Bank, including its annual and any other reports, interim management statements and any

other formal announcements relating to its financial performance, reviewing significant financial reporting issues and judgements which they contain; internal controls and risk management systems; the adequacy and effectiveness of the compliance function of the Bank; the effectiveness of the internal audit function of the Bank and related matters; and external audit related matters. The recommendations of AAC and progress of IAD are reported to the Monetary Board quarterly.

The Bank is subject to an external audit by the Auditor General under the Monetary Law Act sections 42 & 43. The Auditor General in turn has obtained the services of a firm of Chartered Accountants M/s KPMG. to carry out an audit under International Standards of Auditing to ensure compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.

(c) Credit Exposure by Credit Rating

The following table represents the credit ratings of respective financial assets or issuers, based on the ratings of Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Under Standard & Poor’s ratings and Fitch Ratings, AAA is the highest quality rating possible and indicates the lowest expectations of credit risk. It is assigned only in the case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitment. AA is very high quality grade, indicating very low expectation of credit risk, and A is an upper medium grade, indicating a low expectation of credit risk; BBB is the lowest investment grade rating, indicating that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk and exhibits adequate protection parameters, ratings lower than AAA can be modified by + or – signs to indicate relative standing within the major categories. NR indicates that Standard and Poor’s or Fitch Rating have not rated the entity.

45.2 Interest Rate Risk

(a) Foreign Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from the changes in interest rates.

The interest rate sensitivity of the Fixed Income Securities portfolio, except the investment in Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP), measured by the potential loss incurred due to a rise in interest rate by 10 basis points is another risk measure used by the Bank. Sensitivity of the risk exposure of the segmented Fixed Income Securities Portfolio is given below:

Portfolio SegmentPotential Loss ( USD Mn)20172016Trading and 7.555.16Available for SaleRAMP0.030.03

RMD manages the interest rate risk of the foreign assets portfolio by employing the following strategies:i) While the interest rate sensitivity measures the effect of a change in interest rates on the foreign assets portfolio, the Bank uses Modified Duration (MD) as a measurement of interest rate risk which considers interest rates as well as the duration of an investment. The MD measures the change in price of a security for a given change in the interest rates (yield).A higher MD indicates a higher risk. Hence, the Bank sets an appropriate MD from time to time considering the developments in the financial markets, portfolio characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio. The MDs of the foreign assets portfolio are tabulated below:

Modified Duration

Investment SegmentModified Duration20172016Capital Market (Fixed Income Securities)2.022.26

RAMP1.391.42

ii) Since the MD does not account for large changes in prices, another measure used for management of interest rate risk of the foreign reserves portfolio is convexity. Convexity measures the extent of deviation in bond price-yield curve from a straight line representing duration. It allows improving the duration approximation for bond price changes. Convexity is a change in Duration for a change in yield. It measures the predictive error of Modified Duration. In other words, it is the second derivative of a security’s price with respect to its yield.

iii) Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR summarizes in a single number the downside risk of the portfolio, under normal market conditions, from financial market movements. Therefore, VaR is the maximum loss over a target horizon such that there is a low, pre-specified probability that the actual loss will be larger. VaR gives a number, in terms of money, which can be aggregated across risks and positions. The Bank uses historical simulation method to calculate VaR number for 10 days period at 99% confidence interval. The historical method for estimating VaR is sometimes referred to as the historical simulation method. As an example to calculate the 5% daily VaR using the historical method is to accumulate a number of past daily returns, rank the returns from highest to lowest, and identify the lowest 5% of returns. The highest of these lowest 5% of returns is the 1-day, 5% VaR.

iv) Trading & Open Position Limits

Bank assigns specific dealer limits on intra-day and overnight position limits for individual dealers by way of “Dealing Authority “.

Interest rate risk measures related to the investments in the Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP) is reported to the Foreign Reserve Management Committee on a regular basis.

(b) Local Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

The local Treasury Bill portfolio is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position of the Bank at amortized cost as it represents loans provided to the Government of Sri Lanka. This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Treasury Bills with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Treasury Bills to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Treasury Bills in the Bank’s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank’s actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Treasury Bill portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank’s Treasury Bill portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank’s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets

45.3 Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the Bank’s holding of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserve management function. Volatility of the foreign exchange markets may expose the Bank to exchange risk. The Monetary Board and Foreign Reserves Management Committee (FRMC) have set percentage holdings of different currencies in its International Reserves. In

deciding on the currency allocation, public debt repayment requirements are given due consideration. Accordingly, the Bank holds most major currencies such as US Dollars, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen, Euro, Australian Dollars and New Zealand Dollars. Compliance with limits established for foreign currency positions are monitored.

45.5 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the difficulty that an entity will encounter in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk is also the risk that an entity will have to sell a financial asset quickly at much less than its fair value

a) Liquidity is a key consideration in determining the composition of the Bank’s foreign currency assets. This reflects the potential requirement to liquidate foreign reserves for intervention purposes and to settle other commitments such as public debt and IMF Loan repayments when the need arises. The Bank has adopted the following measures aimed at ensuring quick access to funds:

• Liquid asset ratios based on the liquidity characteristics of securities held

• Limits on maximum proportion of reserves that may be held in one currency and with one counterparty

b) In order to reduce the level of liquidity risk arising out of the local currency activities, particularly open market operations, the Bank uses highly liquid marketable instruments such as Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds as collateral. It manages the daily liquidity position of the banking system by way of infusing into or withdrawal from the system, using instruments such as repo / reverse repo, CBSL securities and USD /LKR Swaps.

47. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

47.1 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

The fair value of assets and liabilities is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms-length transaction. When a financial instrument is traded in an organised and liquid market that is able to absorb a significant transaction without moving the price against the trader, quoted market values represent the fair value.

The Bank uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of assets and liabilities by valuation technique :

Level 1: Quoted (un-adjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly;

Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data;

The following table shows an analysis of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value hierarchy:

Land & Buildings

Valuation MethodLand is valued using market approach with direct comparison method, whereby assets are compared to recent sales with no added or nominal added improvement value, making adjustments for points of difference to derive the fair value.

Depreciated Current Replacement Cost (DRC) method is used in valuing all the buildings except Central Point, White Aways and Lloyds Building, considering that the assets controlled by the public sector entities that provide service to the community are not traded on an open liquid market.

Income approach is used to value the other buildings which values the property based on estimated future income, profits or cash flow that are converted (discounted) to a single current amount.

Under the Market Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Price per perch would get higher/(lower)Price per square foot would get higher/(lower)Depreciation rate for building would get lower/(higher)Under Income Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Gross annual rentals would get higher/(lower)Years purchase would get higher/(lower)

47.2 Repurchase and Reverse-Repurchase Agreements

The reported value of repurchase and reverse-repurchase agreements is considered to approximate their fair value due to short term nature of the agreements. The carrying value of Sri Lanka Government Securities sold under agreements to repurchase as at 31 December 2017 was Rs. 6,503.88 Mn (2016 – Rs. 21,383.72 Mn) and provided Standing Deposit Facility of Rs. 34,151.39 Mn (2016 – Rs 48,670.71 Mn). The carrying value of Sri Lanka Government Securities purchased under agreements to resell as at 31 December 2017 was Rs. 22,375.12 Mn (2016 – Rs. 30,821.39 Mn).

47.3 Currency in Circulation

The fair value of Currency in Circulation is considered to be its face value as reported in the Financial Statements.

Derivatives

Derivative valuation models use forward prices (calculated by extrapolating the forward points available in the market) and discount rates calculated based on zero coupon yield curves of the respective currencies as of the valuation date. If the instrument that is valued contains a margin, adjustments are made to the forward prices and/or the interest rates to represent the impact of the margin rate.

Embedded Derivatives - Currency OptionsFair Value of the Embedded Derivative Products was calculated using Black- Scholes model

47.4 Deposits

The carrying value of deposits are considered to approximate their fair value as they are payable on demand.

47.5 Determination of Fair Value and Fair Value Hierarchy

2.1 Issuance of Prudential Regulations

Prudential regulations issued to licensed banks are provided in Part III of this Report. A summary of the major prudential regulations is given below.

(a) Loan to Value Ratios for Credit Facilities in respect of Motor Vehicles

Licensed banks were required to maintain Loan to Value (LTV) ratios, when granting credit facilities for the purchase or utilization of motor vehicles, as a macro-prudential measure to curtail the excessive credit in the banking sector for purchase of motor vehicles. Subsequently, licensed banks were informed of the basis of valuation of vehicles, interpretations and categorisation of vehicle classes provided by the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) that may be used with regard to LTV ratios for credit facilities in respect of motor vehicles.

(b) Implementation of Budget Proposals 2017

Licensed banks were informed to implement necessary measures to increase distribution of credit to identified sectors, i.e., agriculture, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), exports, tourism, youth and women, and to enhance banking services in keeping with the national policy approved in the Budget 2017.

(c) Amendment to Pawning Conditions Issued to Licensed Banks Licensed banks were required to report details of bulk purchases of pawned articles at auctions as a measure to eliminate gold smuggling.

(f) Annual Licence Fee of Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialised Banks

Annual licence fees of the licensed banks for the calendar year 2018 were determined based on the total assets of licensed banks, as at end 2017.

(g) Enhancement of Minimum Capital Requirement

Licensed banks were required to enhance minimum capital requirements in order to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector and support the implementation of Basel III framework in Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, by 31 December 2020 existing locally incorporated licensed commercial banks are required to maintain Rs. 20 billion, banks incorporated outside Sri Lanka with assets up to Rs.100 billion are required to maintain Rs. 5 billion and banks with assets over Rs.100 billion are required to maintain Rs. 10 billion, respectively.

2.3 Conduct of Continuous Supervision

(a) Continuous supervision is an on-going monitoring mechanism on the affairs of individual banks, which serves as an early warning system to ascertain the operational efficiency and long term sustainability of the entire banking industry and enables the implementation of corrective measures where necessary, to ensure safety of depositors’ funds.

(b) Continuous supervision was conducted based on periodic financial and performance information submitted by banks through the web based FinNet System. Approximately, 69 statutory returns are submitted monthly/ quarterly/ annually for each bank through the FinNet system, covering financial and prudential information, of which, 18 returns are submitted manually. Revamping of the database maintained in BSD in consultation with IT Department continued in 2017 to facilitate better report generation. In this regard, 30 existing FinNet returns were finalised for amendment, 17 new returns were introduced and 2 returns were amended in the FinNet System to comply with new Banking Act Directions issued by BSD. In addition, the progress on addressing supervisory concerns identified during statutory examinations of banks within specified time targets were monitored on a quarterly basis during 2017.

(c) In the process of continuous monitoring and supervision of banks, special reports were submitted with respect to banking industry loans to the construction sector, credit growth and sector concentration in the banking industry, credit to deposit ratio in the banking industry, Northern and North-Eastern Province indebtedness, credit granted to flood affected borrowers and quarterly reports on banking industry performance. In addition, banking industry aggregate data were shared with other departments of the Central Bank and external government institutions to facilitate preparation of reports.

(d) During 2017, approximately 820 customer complaints were handled relating to loan interest rates, rescheduled loans, credit cards, pawning operations, banking malpractices and frauds, unauthorised withdrawal of funds and seeking a reduction in Automated Teller Machine (ATM) charges & fees. Further, BSD also facilitated the collection and submission of information on the reimbursement of interest on senior citizen fixed deposits held in licensed banks to the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media on a quarterly basis.

(e) A summary of the banking sector performance from 2015 to 2017 is given in Table II-2 below. A detailed assessment is provided in Chapter 8 on Financial Sector Performance and System Stability.

2.4 Conduct of Periodic Examinations

(a) BSD conducted 38 examinations during 2017 including 06 that continued from the previous year. Examinations of 33 licensed banks were completed in 2017 through formal discussions with the management of the respective banks and submission of reports to the Monetary Board, while 05 examinations were in the process of completion. Major concerns raised at certain examinations included low capitalization and efficiency, lapses in corporate governance and management, deficiencies in technology risk management, under-estimation of non-performing loans, provision for bad and doubtful loans and concerns over treasury operations. In addition, several examinations with limited scope were conducted on areas such as document verification, investments in government securities, corporate governance, customer complaints, cash processing and unethical business practices.

(b) Further, BSD has initiated a process in 2017 for developing an internal methodology to assign ratings to licensed banks, based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative indicators attributable to banks’ efficiency and sustainability. For this purpose, a Bank Sustainability Rating Indicator (BSRI) model is to be adopted to facilitate risk-based supervision. Accordingly, as a part of strengthening the on-site examinations of banks under a risk-based approach, BSD will adopt a framework to categorize the banks in deciding the frequency and scope of examinations based on the risks attributed to each bank.

Regular meetings were conducted with the senior management of concerned licensed banks to discuss bank specific matters, to ensure proper oversight and timely implementation of corrective action, and meetings with the Board appointed committees of banks to ensure the sustainability of the banking sector. Further, BSD facilitated banks to obtain necessary information and clarifications on the adoption of new Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards, by organising meetings with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.

BSD organised a meeting of the Financial Sector Oversight Committee (FSOC), which comprises Heads of

core financial sector regulators, to facilitate cooperation among member institutions to ensure the efficiency, soundness and safety of the financial system falling within their purview.

5. CURRENCY

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has the sole right and authority to issue currency in Sri Lanka which includes both currency notes and coins as stipulated in the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949. In fulfilling this task, the Central Bank is entrusted with designing, printing of currency notes, minting of coins and distributing of currency notes and coins.

Currency Department of the Central Bank handles functions relating to this statutory responsibility of the Monetary Board. CRD continuously engages in building and maintaining public confidence in the currency by preserving its value and integrity and making available adequate stocks to meet the demand for currency, which is essential for smooth functioning of the economy.

5.1. Currency Printing and Minting

During 2017, CRD made arrangements to print 270 million pieces of currency notes and 970 million pieces of coins, in order to meet the demand for currency notes in the

economy and the respective deliveries will be made in the coming years, to ensure good quality notes in circulation and ensure sufficient stocks to meet the public demand.

The arrangements were also made to design a new set of circulation standard coins from metal of stainless steel for the denominations of Rupee 1, Rupees 2, Rupees 5 and Rupees 10 reducing the sizes of coins. This new coin series is expected to reduce the cost of minting and ease the handling of coins.

5.2. Currency Distribution

(a) Currency in Circulation

Demand for currency notes and coins increased in 2017 in line with the economic growth and inflation in Sri Lankan economy, notwithstanding the continued usage of technology driven non-cash modes of payment.

Accordingly, the value of total currency in circulation increased by 8.3 per cent to Rs.598 billion as at 31 December 2017, over the previous year, as shown in Table 6.

(d) Issue of Commemorative Coins and sales of commemorative collector items

In January 2017, CRD issued an uncirculated silver commemorative coin with a face value of Rs. 2000 to mark the 100th Anniversary of Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 in recognition of its contribution to the nation as a premier school in the country.

A circulation standard commemorative coin with a face value of Rs. 10 was issued in July 2017 to celebrate 150 years of Ceylon Tea and to recognise its contribution to the national economy as an important and long-standing export oriented commodity in Sri Lanka.

The Central Bank issued a commemorative currency note to mark the 70th independence celebration of the country, in February 2018.

In addition, commemorative collector items were sold through the CBSL Regional Offices and the Economic History Museum in Fort, Colombo.

5.3 Clean Note Policy

CRD implemented the Clean Note Policy during the past several years with the objective of ensuring good quality currency notes in circulation in the country, while withdrawing unfit/unserviceable currency notes from circulation.

Since clean currency notes in circulation reflect a positive image of the country, CRD initiated several actions to strengthen the Clean Note Policy in 2017.

During 2017, CRD continued to ensure the regular supply of good quality (fit) currency notes and disposal of unfit currency notes, by destroying 177 million pieces of unfit currency notes deposited by LCBs, amounting to a face value of Rs. 94.2 billion. CRD reissued in to circulation 311.7 million pieces of serviceable currency notes amounting to Rs 504.6 billion.

CRD took measures to strictly enforce the law on willful mutilation, alteration and defacement of currency notes, considering the increased number of willfully mutilated, altered

and/or defaced currency notes among the currency deposits of LCBs on a regular basis.

A sound awareness campaign was conducted to educate the general public to refrain from such practices and informed to exchange such currency notes in their possession before 31 December 2017 as no claims on such currency notes will be accepted after 31 December 20171.

CRD conducted meetings with cash managers of LCBs, to discuss currency related issues to improve the efficiency and effectiveness in currency management and operations among LCBs and matters relating to the developments in the currency sorting and handling practices, to extend the effective life of currency notes.

5.4 Assistance Provided to Law Enforcement Authorities

During 2017, CRD continued facilitating law enforcement authorities regarding violation of the provisions of MLA on counterfeiting of currency as follows;

(a) Closely co-operated with the Counterfeit Currency Bureau of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Police and law enforcement authorities pertaining to counterfeiting attempts. Counterfeit notes detected in 2017 amounted to 5,812 pieces. The ratio of counterfeit currency notes in circulation which is measured by parts per million, was 5 during 2017.

(b) Endorsed and issued 138 certificates in terms of section 59 of the MLA with the signature of the Governor, as conclusive evidence for the imitation of currency note, to facilitate proceedings in courts.

(c) Attended 10 court cases to give evidence on currency counterfeiting.

5.5 Public Awareness

CRD conducted several public awareness programmes during 2017, targeting the general public, police officers, staff of LCBs and other financial institutions, teachers, students and public officials, to educate them/general public on the history of Sri Lanka currency, security features of Sri Lanka currency notes, good handling practices of currency and on the effective use of coins as follows;

(a) Conducted 31 seminars/workshops at the Center for Banking Studies, various LCBs, police stations and at national schools, etc.

(b) Displayed the mobile currency museum at 15 exhibitions around the country.

(c) Facilitated about 8,760 visitors, mainly school children, tourists and general public at the three currency museums of the Central Bank and distributed information material and leaflets, highlighting the clean note policy and consequences of counterfeiting currency notes.

1 Considering the immense requests made by the general public and the difficulties faced by the general public when exchanging such currency notes, the time period to exchange such currency notes was extended until 31 March 2018.

(d) Conducted 05 discussion programs through leading TV channels and radio.

5.6 Approvals for Reproduction of currency notes

In terms of the policy approved by the Monetary Board, nine approvals were granted for reproduction of currency notes in 2017.

5.7 System Improvements

CRD initiated actions to ensure the inspection of every single currency note at the end of the production line at the printer, in order to enhance the quality standard of the currency notes issued by the Central Bank. Several initiatives were taken to automate currency requisition and issuance in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness of currency operations.

6. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

6.1 Functions of DOD

The Domestic Operations Department (DOD) is entrusted with several functions, as provided for in the Monetary Law Act (MLA). They are (a) conducting Open Market Operations (OMO), (b) regulation of the statutory reserves of commercial banks, (c) acting as the banker and the official depository of the government, government agencies and other institutions acting on behalf of the government, and banker to commercial banks (d) providing temporary advances to the government, (e) maintaining accounts for dealer direct participants (f) provision of intraday credit to the participants and non-dealer bidders and (g) engaging in credit operations with banking institutions, as and when necessary.

6.2 Implementation of Monetary Policy

The Department continued to implement monetary policy with the objective of maintaining short-term interest rates at a level commensurate with the prevailing monetary policy stance of the Central Bank. In steering the Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR) towards the desired level, DOD relied mainly on OMO. Standing facilities meanwhile, continued to be available to market participants.

Inter-bank money market liquidity, which recorded a high level of excess at the beginning of the year, primarily as a result of the Central Bank’s claims on the government increasing since the end of the previous year, declined thereafter and from mid-February till mid-July, fluctuated between surplus and deficit levels. This situation however changed, mainly as a result of the Central Bank’s purchases of foreign exchange from the domestic foreign exchange market from around mid-July, as a result of which money market liquidity continued to increase till the end of the year.

When the market had excess liquidity, the excess liquidity was absorbed on a temporary basis through short-term and long-term repo auctions and on a permanent basis by way of outright sales of Treasury bills. Reverse repo auctions

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 70

Part II

were conducted to provide liquidity in times of shortages of liquidity, in addition to liquidity provision through the standing lending facility.

The Bond Borrowing Programme, where the Central Bank borrows Treasury bonds from the Employees Provident Fund to provide as collateral for transactions under Repo auctions, was revived in November 2017, as the Central Bank’s holdings of Treasury bills were inadequate for OMO purposes.

Access to real time accurate information on money market transactions is critical to facilitating the price discovery process in the money market. DOD introduced an online system to Authorized Money Brokers (AMBs) in 2016 to report details of transactions handled by them. This system was further developed into a new system called the Central Integrated Market Monitor (CIMM) in 2017. All participating institutions (PIs) (Licensed Commercial Banks, Primary Dealers and EPF) and AMBs report their transactions in the call, government securities and foreign exchange markets through the CIMM which came into operation in January 2018. Further, LCBs also report their daily liquidity position through the CIMM. The CIMM replaced several reporting systems that existed previously, namely, the Money Brokers Reporting System, Money Market Monitoring System, Liquidity Monitoring System, and Videsha Vinimaya System. The CIMM captures vital market information of the call, government securities and foreign exchange markets.

6.2.1 Open Market Operations (OMO)

(a) Liquidity forecast

DOD makes a market liquidity forecast on a daily basis to determine the types and tenors of OMO to be conducted on a particular day. To forecast liquidity, the monetary policy actions and autonomous factors are taken into consideration. Autonomous factors include currency in circulation, FX transactions of the Central Bank, commercial bank reserve positions and transactions of the Central Bank with the government. Based on the outcome of such daily forecasts of money market liquidity, the following OMOs were conducted in 2017.

(b) Auctions

(i) Repo Auctions

Overnight repo auctions were conducted on 163 days in 2017, in order to absorb liquidity on an overnight basis when the money market liquidity was in surplus. The offered and accepted amounts at these auctions totaled Rs. 4,284.5 billion and Rs. 3,261.5 billion, respectively. The weighted average yield rates at these auctions were in a range of 7.25 per cent to 7.75 per cent.

Short-term auctions are conducted as a strategy to absorb liquidity up to one week on a same day settlement basis. DOD conducted 8 short-term repo auctions where a total of Rs. 115.0 billion was

offered, of which only Rs. 49.2 billion was accepted at weighted average yield rates ranging between 7.31 per cent and 7.43 per cent.

Long-term repo auctions are conducted with a view to absorbing market liquidity for a period of beyond 7 days. A total of 11 long term repo auctions were conducted in the months of January and September 2017, with a total offered volume of Rs. 225.0 billion. Bids were accepted at only 2 auctions. The accepted bids totalled Rs. 17.0 billion. The weighted average yield rate at these two auctions was 7.44 per cent. The tenures of the long-term repo auctions varied between 08 days and 16 days.

(ii) Reverse Repo Auctions

Overnight reverse repo auctions were conducted on 66 days in order to inject liquidity when the money market was in deficit. The offered and accepted amounts at these auctions totaled Rs. 1,292.0 billion and Rs 1,049.6 billion, respectively. The weighted average yield rates at these auctions were in a range of 8.47 per cent to 8.75 per cent. DOD did not conduct short-term and long-term Reverse Repo auctions during the year 2017.

(c) Outright Transactions

Auctions for the outright sale of Treasury bills are conducted to absorb excess liquidity on a permanent basis. DOD conducted 71 outright sales auctions in 2017, offering Treasury bills worth Rs. 380.0 billion. Bids were accepted only at 40 auctions. The total amount absorbed through these auctions was Rs. 110.3 billion. The weighted average yield rates at these auctions were in a range of 7.78 per cent to 9.23 per cent. No bids were received at 20 auctions conducted and bids received at 11 auctions were rejected. DOD did not conduct any auctions for the outright purchase of Treasury bills during the year 2017.

6.2.2. Standing Facility

Standing facilities were provided throughout the year at the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) to PIs, which were unable to meet their short-term liquidity requirements fully through the inter-bank money market and OMO auctions. Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) transactions recorded a daily average of Rs. 16.4 billion in 2017, having recorded a total volume of Rs. 3,954.9 billion for the year 2017. The total volume lent under the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) was Rs. 2,129.5 billion in 2017, with a daily average volume of Rs. 8.8 billion.

6.2.3 Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR)

The SRR determines the minimum amount of reserves that each commercial bank is required to hold, in the reserve account with the Central Bank, in terms of the regulations of the Central Bank, in proportion to the total rupee deposit liabilities of the respective bank. DOD is responsible for both administering the maintenance of statutory reserves as per the SRR and

Part II

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 71

monitoring compliance by commercial banks in this regard. The SRR, which was revised upward to 7.5 per cent to be effective from 16 January 2016 remained unchanged at that level during 2017.

6.2.4 Bank Rate

The Bank Rate is the rate of interest at which the Central Bank provides short term advances to Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) under Section 87 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA). The Bank Rate remained unchanged at 15 per cent in 2017. However, the Central Bank did not lend funds to any LCB at this rate during 2017.

6.3 Banker to Commercial Banks and the Government

6.3.1 Accounts of Financial Institutions

Performing the functions relating to the Central Bank’s role as the banker to banks, DOD continued to provide current account facilities to LCBs. Given that Primary Dealers are participants of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and are Central Bank’s counterparties in relation to OMO and standing facilities, DOD continued to operate current accounts for Primary Dealers and provided related facilities to them. These functions of DOD facilitated the smooth operation of the payment and settlement systems of the country. At the end of 2017, the Central Bank maintained accounts for 25 LCBs and 8 PDs. These accounts were operated on a real time gross settlement basis.

6.3.2 Government Accounts

Performing the functions relating to the Central Bank’s role as the banker to the government, DOD continued to maintain the accounts of government departments, agencies and statutory boards, and provided the required banking facilities to them. The total number of accounts maintained by the Central Bank amounted to 61 as at end 2017. DOD handled 20,114 transactions amounting to Rs. 15,767.4 billion, during the year, on behalf of the government. More than 90 per cent of such transactions were in relation to the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury (DST) Account, the Public Debt Department’s Current Account, the Inland Revenue Commissioner’s VAT Refund Account and the President’s Fund Account.

In terms of Section 89 of the MLA, the Central Bank provides provisional advances to the government, free of charge, with a ceiling of 10 per cent of the estimated government revenue approved by the parliament for a given fiscal year. At the beginning of 2017, the amount of the provisional advance was increased by Rs. 18.8 billion to Rs. 203.9 billion, based on the government’s revenue estimated for the year 2017 and approved by the Parliament, compared to that of Rs. 185.1 billion for the year 2016.

6.4 Provision of Intra-Day Liquidity Facility (ILF)

DOD contributed towards the smooth and efficient functioning of the RTGS system by making available intra-day funding through the ILF to PIs. This facility was provided

free of charge against the collateral of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, which were valued at their current market prices, with a sufficient hair cut to absorb any variations in market prices during the day.

The total value and average daily value of ILF drawn during the year amounted to Rs. 11,428 billion and Rs. 47.4 billion, respectively. This shows an increase in ILF utilisation over that of the previous year which amounted to a total of Rs. 9,351 billion with a daily average of Rs. 38.8 billion.

6.5 Supervision of Authorised Money Brokers

With effect from 5th March 2018, the Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2018 repealed and replaced the Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2013 as amended by the Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2016. These regulations are expected to be more effective in facilitating and guiding the Money Brokers’ role in the price discovery process in the money, foreign exchange and government securities markets. As at end March 2018, a total of nine companies have been issued the “Certificate of Authorisation” under these regulations, which are designated as “Authorised Money Brokers” (AMBs). During the year 2017, 10 meetings were held by the DOD with the Boards of Directors of these companies while the DOD conducted 8 on-site examinations. Further, in 2017, DOD took regulatory action against an AMB for violating the Money Broking Regulations.

7. ECONOMIC RESEARCH

Economic Research Department (ERD) was formed in 1950 at the time of the establishment of the Central Bank under the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949. As the “Economic Think Tank” of the Central Bank, ERD was conferred with the function of preparing data and conducting economic research for the purpose of guiding the Monetary Board and the Governor in formulating, implementing, and executing policies and measures and for the information of the public, in the areas of money and banking and other economic subjects of general interest. ERD performed its main duties with the view of maintaining economic and price stability and maintaining external sector stability. Further, in discharging the role of the CBSL as the economic advisor to the government, ERD continued to provide recommendations and policy advice to the government on emerging economic issues and fiscal policy measures required for maintaining macroeconomic

Part II

stability while analysing the impact of fiscal policy measures already adopted. Moreover, ERD continued to engage in policy research facilitating effective policy formulation and meeting statutory requirements of publication of annual report and other statutory reports. In addition, ERD continued to disseminate information and data to all stakeholders of the economy including the general public, and maintain a close relationship with international organisations on behalf of the government.

In 2017, the Department was restructured to formulate a “Real Sector” Division by amalgamating three existing divisions namely, Economic and Social Overheads Division, Agriculture Division and Industry Division. Streamlining of divisions within the Department enabled ERD to improve the quality and depth of analyses while managing the staff strength effectively during the year.

7.1 Maintaining Economic and Price Stability

While facilitating the Central Bank to conduct monetary policy to achieve economic and price stability, which is a key requirement to foster an environment conducive for sustained growth and higher living standards for the people, ERD continued to monitor macroeconomic developments closely, both in domestic and external fronts, to facilitate proactive policy actions where needed. Accordingly, as the secretariat of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), ERD facilitated its deliberations with its comprehensive forward looking analyses of economic and monetary conditions using continued surveillance of model based macroeconomic projections, macroeconomic statistics and estimates together with expert judgement, enabling the MPC to provide proactive policy advice to the Monetary Board in the conduct of monetary policy. ERD assisted the Governor to prepare the annual policy statement on “Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2017 and Beyond” (Road Map), where the CBSL announced that the conduct of monetary policy will be strengthened through the move towards a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework to preserve price stability with a medium term focus within a market based exchange rate system, while supporting real sector stability. In line with this decision, ERD incorporated a forward looking policy analysis and medium-term outlook into the monetary policy process based on its medium-term model projections at MPC meetings since June 2017. Several inter-departmental and staff level pre MPC discussions were also added to the monetary policy decision making process. Meanwhile, the number of MPC meetings per annum was reduced from 12 to 8, allowing more time for the staff to conduct deeper economic analysis and provide better inputs to the MPC and the Monetary Board. These changes are expected to facilitate the CBSL to gradually prepare for the move towards FIT. The CBSL re-established the Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC), with ERD providing secretariat assistance to the Committee, in order to obtain stakeholders’ views and align the policies in a way that is mutually beneficial to stakeholders and the Central Bank. ERD also compiled

Monetary Statistics based on the IMF Manual on Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS) - 2016, which was submitted to the IMF to be published in International Financial Statistics (IFS). ERD continued to work with the IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission on macroeconomic modelling in 2017 to improve the robustness of the monetary policy decision-making process based on the medium-term Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS), complemented by several satellite models. In addition, ERD worked with an IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission on Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Design to develop a comprehensive roadmap towards transitioning to a FIT framework by 2020.

7.2 Maintaining External Sector Stability

With the aim of assisting the maintenance of external sector stability of the economy, ERD continued to conduct comprehensive assessments of global and domestic economic developments and provided appropriate policy advice and recommendations. Analyses on external sector developments, which are based on external sector statistics related to international trade and finance as well as the movements of nominal and real exchange rates, were reported to the MPC and the Monetary Board to facilitate appropriate policy decision making. While monitoring market developments to identify any pressure on the exchange rate and the possible impact on gross official reserves, ERD continued to evaluate the monetary policy implications of numerous foreign loans to be obtained by the government, as per the provisions set out in the MLA.

Further, ERD was instrumental in continuously monitoring the progress in relation to the quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets and structural benchmarks agreed upon under the three year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of SDR 1.1 billion (approximately USD 1.5 billion) from the IMF and provided regular updates to the senior management to assist decision making. Accordingly, as the focal point of coordinating the IMF-EFF programme, ERD engaged in negotiations and discussions related to programme targets and performance, with the assistance of other relevant Departments of the CBSL and relevant Ministries.

Several initiatives were taken by ERD during the year in order to improve the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics to comply with internationally accepted data reporting standards. Accordingly, merchandise trade statistics were compiled as per Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) Revision 04, and data is published under the new classification along with the existing classification in the Annual Report 2017. ERD continued the publication of Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics in the BPM6 format on a quarterly basis and International Reserve Data Template (RDT) on a monthly basis while making timely submissions related to Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) to the World Bank and direct investment data to the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) on an annual basis. During the year, ERD successfully

Part II

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 73

disseminated data according to the Advance Release Calendar of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the IMF. Moreover, ERD conducted several surveys during the year to ensure accuracy and timeliness of external sector data. These surveys included Annual International Investment Survey (AIIS), which was used to collect data on foreign assets and liabilities of the private sector and surveys related to trade in services covering a number of industries such as IT, transportation, telecommunication, construction and insurance. The monthly survey with commercial banks on inward workers’ remittances was also continued during the year.

7.3 Providing Proactive Policy Advice

ERD continued to provide policy advice to the senior management of the Central Bank, government and other stakeholders, mainly on monetary policy, exchange rate policy, growth policy and fiscal sector related issues in 2017 as well. In compliance with Section 116(1) of the MLA, the September 15th Report, a confidential report which highlights the developments in the economy over the first half of the year, was submitted to the Hon. Minister of Finance. This report also included policy proposals that may be used in the preparation of the budget for 2018. In addition, ERD provided policy assessments and advice to the Hon. Minister of Finance as statutorily required under various sections of the MLA. In addition, ERD played a key role in the preparation of the Government’s Vision 2025 policy document and provided technical inputs to the National Economic Council (NEC) and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM). Moreover, ERD provided independent observations on macroeconomic implications on a number of Cabinet Papers as well as on several policy documents such as the National Trade Policy and National Export Strategy (NES) during the year.

Director of ERD served as a member of several committees including the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Market Operations Committee (MOC), the Financial System Stability Committee, the Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC), the Foreign Exchange Reserve Management Committee (FRMC), the Tender Board for the issuance of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, Investment Oversight Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the Training Committee. In addition to serving in the MPC of the Central Bank which is coordinated by ERD, senior officers of ERD continued to serve as members of a number of internal committees such as the MPC, the MOC, the DDMC, Investment Committee (IC), Foreign Reserve Management Committee (FRMC), Committee to decide prudential level of Central Bank capital, Working Committee for Implementing FIT, Steering Committee on Implementing a Road Map for Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka, Library Advisory Committee (LAC) and Research Publications Committee (RPC) and Committees on Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) and Revamping the FINNET System.

ERD staff continued to serve as members in numerous committees and boards of several external institutions and

provided relevant policy guidance. Such representations included committees and boards related to Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI), National Science Foundation, Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, Ministry of Power and Energy and Ceylon Electricity Board. In addition, Technical Evaluation Committees on the Project of constructing a powerplant at Kerawalapitiya, Project Committees on Rehabilitation of Elephantpass Saltern Ltd., Restructuring of the Paranthan Chemicals Company Ltd., Restructuring of Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd., Technical Core Committee for the National Export Strategy, Family Budget Unit and other national level committees such as National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC) and Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Coordinating Committee were the other committees served by ERD staff during the year.

7.4 Statutory Publications and Dissemination of Data and Information

ERD is responsible for releasing statutory publications of the Central Bank and dissemination of data and information in a timely and accurate manner. Accordingly, ERD compiles and publishes two flagship publications annually with the contribution of other departments. As per the provisions stipulated in Section 35 of the MLA, the Annual Report 2016 was published on time, in all three languages. The Annual Report 2016 provided a comprehensive analysis of macroeconomic developments, global economic environment, medium term macroeconomic outlook, and issues and policy responses covering all the sectors of the economy during the year together with the accounts and operations of the Central Bank, major administrative measures and major legislative enactments related to operations of the banking system as well as statistical appendices. In addition, Recent Economic Developments: Highlights of 2017 and Prospects for 2018, was published in all three languages in November 2017, providing a mid-year assessment of the macroeconomic conditions that prevailed during 2017 and the outlook for 2018. For the eleventh consecutive year, ERD assisted the Governor in preparing the policy statement of the Central Bank, Road Map 2018: Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2018 and Beyond in December 2017 with inputs received from other departments, which was announced to the public on 03 January 2018. The Road Map was announced with the purpose of sharing the future policy direction and actions of the Central Bank with enhanced transparency and clarity, which would help the stakeholders to design and plan their strategies with more certainty.

Dissemination of economic statistics and information to facilitate diverse range of stakeholders of the economy is one of the primary responsibilities vested with ERD. Accordingly, ERD published the monthly statistical bulletin consisting of data related to all sectors of the economy as well as other economic and financial indicators on daily, weekly, monthly,

quarterly and annual basis on the Central Bank website. ERD continued to provide inputs to monthly and weekly economic indicators during the year while publishing the macroeconomic chart pack, which provides a visual representation of important economic and financial statistics in the three languages. In addition, ERD issued regular press releases on the monetary policy stance of the Central Bank to improve transparency of monetary policy operations, and press releases on external sector performance were issued in a timely manner with the view of communicating latest developments of Sri Lanka’s external front. Furthermore, ERD issued press releases on several events in the economy, in the interest of the general public.

7.5 Engaging in Policy Research and Knowledge Sharing

ERD continued to undertake policy research on economic issues of contemporary importance on a regular basis to facilitate proactive decision making on monetary policy by the MPC and the Monetary Board. Accordingly, continuous updates on the state of the domestic and global economy including latest developments and issues in key macroeconomic sectors as well as in capital and financial markets were submitted to the Monetary Board in the form of information series board papers, monetary policy board papers, observation reports and presentations.

The Research Advisory Panel (RAP) of ERD, an internal committee formulated with the aim of fostering the research culture at the Central Bank, continued to provide guidance in research related tasks and knowledge sharing activities throughout the year. “Research in Economics”, a short course on research methodology, which was initiated by the RAP in collaboration with CBS during the year was conducted at the CBS, and the RAP members served as the resource personnel of the course. This course has been designed to enhance the research skills of variety of participants from the Central Bank and other academic institutions by providing valuable insights on research methodology. During the year, ERD published Volume 46, No 1 and 2 of 2016 and Volume 47, No 1 of 2017 of the Staff Studies, the research journal of the Central Bank, which included 6 comprehensive research papers completed by officers from ERD and other Departments. In addition, ERD Seminar series was conducted within the department with the view of enhancing and exchanging knowledge on emerging issues in the field of economics. Further, ERD continued to educate groups of interns from numerous universities and higher education institutions who visited the Department during the year, by raising their awareness on practical aspects of Central Banking.

The 10th International Research Conference (IRC) of the Central Bank was successfully organised by the RAP in December 2017. The Conference was organised under the theme of “Macroeconomic Policy Reforms towards a Vibrant Future” with the aim of encouraging innovative theoretical and empirical research on current macroeconomic policy issues, while providing a platform for researchers from policy making

and academic institutions to share their experiences and views from diverse perspectives. The keynote address of the IRC 2017 was delivered by Prof. Keith Houghton, Emeritus Professor of the Australian National University (ANU) on “Evidence Based Public Policy: The Application of Efficiency Measures-The Case of Publicly Funded Australian Universities”. As in the past, the 10th IRC attracted eminent researchers from renowned universities, research institutions and central banks around the world including Australia, France, Germany, India as well as Sri Lanka. After a rigorous review process, eight research papers, including three research papers from the officers of the ERD, were selected to be presented at the Conference. At IRC 2017, Dr D. S. Wijesinghe Memorial Award for the Best Research Paper was awarded to Mr. Harsha Paranavithana, a Central Bank officer on study leave, for his paper titled “The Transition from Exchange Rate Targeting: The Case of Sri Lanka”. The Conference Proceedings of IRC 2016 was also released at this Conference.

(c) Pre-Retirement Refund Scheme

In terms of the provisions in Employees Provident Fund (Amendment) Act, No. 02 of 2012 and the subsequent procedures passed by the Parliament, payments under the 30 per cent EPF pre-retirement refund scheme has been in operation since 01st July 2015. The scheme is in high demand by beneficiaries and Rs. 58.3 billion has been refunded to over 100,000 beneficiaries by the end of 2017 since the inception of the scheme. During 2017, Rs.17.29 billion has been released to 32,789 beneficiaries under this scheme.

(d) Image Scanning Project

The Image Scanning Project (ISP) was implemented with a view to improving the efficiency of services provided by EPF department by establishing a near-paperless operating system.

With the completion of Phase-I of the project, the traditional model of the EPF record room was converted into an e-Record room. All the Master File records, Form D and re-registration documents have been scanned, indexed and uploaded to the Document Management System. The document retrieval, file updating, notifications and all other related functions have been made available for the departmental users at their own desktop. Most of the manual processes have been automated minimising the involvement of staff members. This transformation has resulted in a considerable saving of time, space and human resources.

Based on the process efficiencies gained through phase-I, the phase-II of the project was initiated at the end of the year 2016 to digitize the other frequently used records. The digitization of documents at the phase-II includes: The Form C and C3 used for the collection of contribution from employers belonging to the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, Refund worksheets from 2002 to 2015 except for the year 2013; Individual Employer Ledgers (IEL) for the period 1974 to 2009; amendment letters from 2010 onwards and re-registration documents belonging to the year 2014. The above scope of the project was completed during the year 2017.

Refund payment and part payment processes were made efficient now as all correspondences related to payment from 2001 is scanned and uploaded to the system. Also other member services such as name amendment and re-registered member detail amendments are also being made efficient.

At the end of year 2017, the scope of the phase-II of the project was extended to include the scanning and indexing of Form C and C3 belonging to the years 2016 and 2017.

(e) EPF Mobile Service Programme

EPF mobile service in the year 2017 was conducted with a view to enhancing the delivery of member services at their convenience and enhancing public awareness on EPF operations.

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 79

Accordingly, during the year the Department conducted 22 mobile services. Some of these mobile services were conducted in collaboration with the Department of Labour, Department of Registration of Persons, Registrar General’s Department and respective District/Divisional Secretariats.

EPF department also participated in mobile services related to EPF, organized by the government and non-government organizations to provide EPF related services. Mobile services offered almost all the services a member could obtain by visiting the EPF Department located in Colombo, at their own area or work place. The services offered to the members and public through the awareness programmes included: Issuing of EPF member balance statements, amendment of EPF member details and accounts, re-registration of member details, promoting online member balance inquiry service and e-return services and providing advice on overall EPF procedures.

In addition, awareness activities were conducted parallel to the mobile services, targeting members, employers and other stakeholders on the services offered by the EPF using various modes of communication such as e-mail, posters, leaflets, video clips and presentations.

Prior to each mobile service, a special awareness programme is conducted for relevant employers, managers and other administrative staff members of respective employers with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of the mobile services.

(f) e-Return System for EPF Payments

Collection of EPF contributions and respective member details by electronic means (e-Returns) was introduced to the registered employers thereby increasing the EPF’s operational efficiency and transparency. This procedure was initiated on a voluntary basis and made mandatory in 2012 for employers with over fifty employments. Actions were taken to enhance the accessibility of employers to the e-Return submission procedure in 2017. As a result, wider discussions were carried out by EPF with Licenced Commercial Bank of Sri Lanka (LCBs) during the year and it has helped to obtain the service of one more LCB from January, 2018. Accordingly, seven LCBs have already joined EPF as collecting agents and three LCBs among them facilitate their online EPF paying customers (employers) with member information validation and real time member accounts updating procedure. In addition, actions were taken to make the employers further aware of the e-Return submission procedure and it benefits for EPF stakeholders. Accordingly, the participation of employers for e-Return submission procedure increased from 6,955 to 7,900 in 2017 covering approximately 65 per cent of the active member accounts representing nearly 80 per cent of the total monthly EPF contributions.

(g) Re-registration of EPF Members

With the intention of providing an efficient service to EPF members, EPF department and the Department of Labour launched a special project to re-register EPF members by

names as appearing in their National Identity Card (NIC) and assign NIC number as the Unique Identification (UID) Number, which enables both parties to use a common Member Centric Database (MCD).

By end 2017, the NIC details of approximately 1.86 million active EPF members (contributing members) had been collected. Out of these, 81 per cent of the member accounts (1.51 million accounts) were assigned UIDs, while the verification of details of the remaining members are being processed.

Registering of new EPF members under NIC details on real time basis commenced in November 2010. Accordingly, a monthly monitoring system has been put in place to capture NIC details of all new members whose member contributions are received for the first time.

Registration of existing members and registration of new members amounted to 53,091 and total number of registrations transferred to the MCD was 71,234 by end 2017.

12.5 Mutual Evaluation and Follow–up Work

In line with the revised recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the third round of Mutual Evaluation (ME) on Sri Lanka was conducted during 2014/15 by the APG with the intention of assessing Sri Lanka’s AML/CFT compliance with the international AML/CFT standards. The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) adopted in September 2015 recommended a series of actions to be implemented by Sri Lanka under APG’s ‘expedite enhanced follow up’ process. In October 2016, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka will be subject to a review of the International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) of the FATF to assess the progress of AML/CFT effectiveness. After several discussions and progress reports, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka has not made sufficient progress in 4 areas, namely International Cooperation, Supervision, Legal Persons and Arrangements and Targeted Financial Sanctions on Proliferations (North Korea & Iran). As a result, the FATF at its Plenary held at Buenos Aires, Argentina in October 2017, listed Sri Lanka as a jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in the FATF’s Compliance Document which is more commonly identified as the “Grey List”. Upon listing, a time bound action plan to address the strategic

deficiencies identified was provided to Sri Lanka. The FIU and other relevant stakeholders have already taken necessary steps to implement the action plan recommended by FATF.

14. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

Entrusted with the task of fulfilling the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) needs of the Central Bank, the Information Technology Department (ITD) continued its dynamic role of providing enterprise level integrated applications to achieve core objectives of the Central Bank.

During the year ITD made its contribution under five major areas, namely, (a) Delivering cost-effective business solutions; (b) Continuous enhancements of the IT infrastructure of the Bank; (c) Contribution to establish national payment system infrastructure; (d) IT security and resilience; (e) Upgrade ICT competencies among the staff.

(a) Delivering cost-effective business solutions

A new Auction System was implemented for the primary issuance of Treasury Bonds with three-phases to enhance the efficiency and transparency of domestic borrowings carried out by the Public Debt Department for the Government of Sri Lanka. The Currency Management System (CMS) used by the Currency Department was further enhanced by the addition of a new interface to capture banknote serial numbers from Single Note Inspection Machines (SNIM) to CMS electronically thereby streamlining the process of currency note consignment receival from the supplier.

Monitoring market information and market participant information is an integral part of the Bank’s activities. In this regard, the Central Integrated Market Monitor (CIMM) System was implemented to collect, analyze and report all information related to money market transactions from banks and dealers while capturing transactions directly in real-time from Bloomberg and Reuters systems for the Domestic Operations Department. The Central Database System (FinNet) used by several departments to monitor information reported by the Banks, Primary Dealers, Leasing Companies and Finance Companies was enhanced with the introduction of new analytical reports, extended surveillance and facility to record abandoned property.

The efficiency of the Country Wide Data Collection System of the Statistics Department was enhanced by introducing a new tablet computer based system to collect prices of goods from teachers stationed in all parts of the island.

Security Program (CSP) announced by SWIFT, security controls were introduced by segregating the SWIFT network from the main LAN and dedicating terminals only for SWIFT operations.

In addition, ITD officials assisted the Payments and Settlements Department (PSD) to formulate policies and guidelines for the minimum compliance standard for mobile applications and also to carry out onsite examinations on Dialog Data Centre, Dialog eZ cash, and Dialog Transport Card System.

(d) Strengthening IT security and resilience

ITD took several measures to enhance IT Security and protect the Bank’s IT assets from any cyber security threats. As a proactive approach, continuous vulnerability assessments were carried out on business-critical IT systems to identify vulnerabilities and necessary remediation actions were taken where necessary to mitigate them and reduce exposure to cyber-attacks. User awareness programs were also carried out to acknowledge employees of critical vulnerabilities and the recommended course of action to stay safe.

Technical Infrastructure setup was completed to introduce digital information classification and a new information classification policy was drafted to be included in the Information Security Policy of the Bank

(e) Upgrading ICT competencies among the staff

With an aim to enhance the IT knowledge of all employees in the Bank, ITD continued to publish awareness banners on the intranet and circulate security advisory alerts through email. Further, in order to uplift the knowledge and skills in the relevant fields, the staff of ITD attended short term training both locally and abroad.

15. INTERNAL AUDIT

The Internal audit function has been in operation in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka since 1951. The mission, scope of work, accountability, independence, responsibility and the authority of the Director and the staff of the Internal Audit Department (IAD) have been included in the Internal Audit Charter approved by the Monetary Board. Audits are performed in line with global standards and industry best practices. A summary of the activities carried out by the Department during 2017 is given below.

15.1 Internal Audit Plans

Strategic Internal Audit Plan (SAP) was developed for three-year period covering 2018-2020. Based on the SAP, Annual Audit Plan (AAP) for 2018 was developed. Both SAP and AAP were reviewed by the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (AAC) and approvals were obtained from the Monetary Board.

by incorporating new processing and informational requirements to improve the efficiency of its main IT system.

(b) Continuous enhancements of the ICT infrastructure

ITD ensured continuous and efficient delivery of IT services in the Bank by taking a number of initiatives.

One of the major infrastructure development projects completed during the year was segregating the corporate network into different segments. Consequently, business critical IT systems were separated from the general IT environment and tight logical and physical security controls were enforced on them. Further, internet access was restricted and privileges were separated on these systems and user computers that have access to these systems reducing vulnerabilities and exposure to cyber-attacks.

Introduced an advanced threat analytics platform to protect the bank from multiple types of advanced targeted cyber-attacks and insider threats. It gathers information from multiple data-sources in the corporate network to learn the behavior of users and other entities in the organization and detects multiple suspicious activities and generates alerts about them.

ITD is continuously striving to create a paperless work environment in the bank and several initiatives were taken in this regard during the previous year. An automation software was implemented to digitize the current paper based board papers and to manage the full process of board meetings digitally. It enabled the board members and other participants of such meetings to access and manage board meeting related content electronically. Further, initial requirement gathering was completed to introduce a document management system to the Bank. This system would further facilitate the movement towards a paperless environment.

(c) Contribution to establish national payment system infrastructure

ITD continued to function as an advisor and a provider of technical expertise for projects of national interest as per the road map of the National Payment Council. ITD Officials contributed their expertise to several national projects during the year.

The establishment of an electronic trading platform and a Bond Clearing house with a Central Counter Party is an important national project set in motion to strengthen the financial market infrastructure. ITD officers served in the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) appointed for the selection of a suitable vendor for the project implementation.

SWIFT is the secure financial messaging platform used in the national payment system. According to the Customer

15.2 Conduct of Audit Assignments

(a) Process and Information System Audits

In 2017, process and information system audits were conducted covering many areas of the Central Bank. Each audit engagement was carried out in four sequential steps in general, i.e., planning, performing, communicating and taking resolution actions. In line with global standards, a four step process was followed for the communication of audit results; conduct of closing conference to get audit observations validated, communication of audit observations in writing, issuing of draft audit report and issuing of final report. Follow-up audits were also conducted at regular intervals to obtain assurance that the communicated audit recommendations were implemented by process owners.

(b) Conduct of Spot Audits

Spot audits were also conducted in 2017 as required and communicated audit results to the process owners and other stakeholders.

(c) Special Assignments

Special reviews were conducted on Reserve Money Data reported to the IMF on test dates by the Economic Research Department as recommended by the IMF Safeguards Mission.

(d) Reporting the Progress of the Conduct of Audits

The progress of conducting audit assignments was reported to the AAC and the Monetary Board, quarterly. Activity reports were submitted to the Auditor General on half-yearly basis.

15.3 Awareness Programmes and Provisioning of Training

IAD conducted an Awareness Programme on Internal Audit for the officers of the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan. Further, IAD conducted a presentation for the Audit Coordinating Officers on the ‘Internal Audit Facilitation Guidelines’. As requested by the Human Resources Department, IAD continued to provide training on internal audit and related disciplines to undergraduates and the students of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka during the year.

15.4 Facilitation to the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee

AAC is a sub-committee of the Monetary Board which advises the Monetary Board on financial reporting, internal controls and risk management systems, compliance, whistleblowing and fraud, internal audit, external audit and any other matter assigned by the Monetary Board. Secretary to the Monetary Board is the Secretary to the AAC. Director of the Internal Audit Department (IAD) functions as the Assistant Secretary to the AAC. Accordingly, IAD provided secretarial facilitation to the AAC during the year.

16. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

In terms of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), the Central Bank is responsible for managing the official foreign reserves of the country. In this regard, International Operational Department (IOD) has been entrusted to perform the reserve management function and to monitor the domestic foreign exchange market to ensure its smooth operation.

The MLA provides the necessary legal framework for foreign reserves management, covering areas on the maintenance and composition of foreign reserves, actions to preserve the international stability of the Rupee, scope of foreign exchange operations of the Central Bank and the powers and responsibilities of the Monetary Board pertaining to foreign reserves management activities. In this aspect, Section 67 of MLA deals with the parameters in respect of asset types, counterparties, instruments and issuers. The Monetary Board may also direct to further widen the scope of reserves management activities to enhance the safety, liquidity and return objectives of reserves management.

16.1 Foreign Reserves Management

Investments of foreign reserves are undertaken in accordance with the Foreign Reserves Management Guidelines as amended and approved by the Monetary Board, under the supervision of the Foreign Reserves Management Committee (FRMC) taking into consideration the safety, liquidity and return objectives. The foreign reserves are denominated in several key currencies and are mainly invested in Fixed Income Securities (FIS), Money Market Investments and Gold. The FIS portfolio consists of highly rated government securities, government guaranteed securities, securities of government agencies and supranational institutions. Transactions undertaken by IOD for reserve management purposes, are performed with Central Banks, highly rated commercial banks and investment houses, which are counterparties approved by FRMC as per the parameters stipulated in the Counterparty Credit Risk Management System (CCRMS) subject to the necessary limit allocations by the Risk Management Department, paying due consideration to the strength and creditworthiness of each counterparty. The key factors considered in determining the asset and currency compositions of the foreign reserves portfolio constitute liquidity requirements and debt service payments while risk management parameters, income generating abilities and specific directions of the Monetary Board are also considered.

The global economy marked a gradual improvement which reflected through the steps taken by the global central banks enduring policy normalization. The Federal Reserve Bank of USA, based on the strength of the economy and improving labor market, began to roll back its stimulus program and raised interest rates three times during the year 2017. In Europe, the economy showed positive developments during the year where unemployment was gradually falling and

emerging signs of inflation pressure being evident, prompting a reduction in stimulus measures including an interest rate hike in coming year 2018. The Japanese economy also gradually pushed toward its target inflation goal.

North Korean nuclear weapon threats continued from time to time during the year where it raised international tensions in the region and beyond. This activist approach in the Middle East and North Korea led to higher global tensions and increased appetite for “safe havens’’, with lower US and German bond yields and a stronger yen during the second half of 2017. Global oil prices started to pick up by the third quarter of the year due to OPEC member countries agreed on supply restrictions. In this dynamic global setting, IOD secured a total return of US Dollars 153 million during the year 2017 through money market investments and capital gains and coupon income derived from FIS and the marked to market return on gold, foreign currencies and FIS.

In 2017, the Central Bank completed its first full year with the Reserve Advisory and Management Programme (RAMP) of the World Bank. RAMP is conducted by World Bank Treasury which provides advisory services and training to official sector investment managers enabling efficient management of foreign currency reserves and other investment portfolios. During 2017, the Central Bank aligned to its Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) which was constructed by determining the appropriate asset allocation scientifically at any point of time to achieve its medium and long term investment objectives of future payment obligations, preservation and enhancement of capital and so on. Under the RAMP, the World Bank Treasury was appointed as an external manager for the Central Bank reserve management by allocating US Dollars 200 million out of the foreign reserves to invest in high-grade government, government guaranteed and supranational bonds for a period of three years.

During 2017, three missions for technical assistance on foreign reserves management were conducted as in-house trainings in the Central Bank with the assistance of World Bank technical experts. These missions focused on capacity building on portfolio management, risk and performance measurement and reporting structures under the SAA structure. In addition World Bank hosted a 5-day international workshop in February 2017 at the Central Bank for participants of RAMP member countries, where the Central Bank co-hosted the event.

16.2 Performance Analysis and Facilitation Activities

Under Performance Analysis and Facilitation, the following main functions relating to the Central Bank’s reserves management are conducted.

(a) Performance Measurement

IOD daily assesses performance of its reserve management activities on total return approach and presents to the FRMC monthly, and quarterly to the Monetary Board, together with

an analysis of reserve position and its trend. The returns of FIS investments are measured against selected benchmarks according to the SAA approved by the Monetary Board. Comparison against benchmarks helps to determine the effectiveness of the Central Bank reserves management strategy by computing extra risk, if any, taken by the Central Bank is adequately compensated by subsequent extra returns. Initiatives have been taken to further elaborate total returns generated through foreign reserves management using performance attribution by IOD in 2018. Accordingly, the resulting findings could be used as value adding inputs in the Central Bank’s foreign reserve management strategy to produce higher long-term returns.

(b) Administration of Treasury Management System (TMS)

IOD, the main user of the TMS, is responsible for the general administration function of the system and ensures a proper coordination among other user Departments, the software provider and its local partner. Accordingly, IOD ensures that the TMS is updated with relevant modifications/ patches and is fully connected with internal systems such as Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and General Ledger (GL) as well as external interfaces such as Bloomberg and Reuters to ensure efficient functioning of TMS related procedures and processes.

Measures were taken during 2017 to perform essential modifications to the current TMS in order to facilitate tranche-wise classification of foreign reserves as per the new SAA, to automate the end-of-day rollover process and to further enhance the controls of the current TMS.

(c) Monitoring of Non-Financial Risks

IOD identifies the non-financial risk profile relating to the reserves management activities and proposes relevant risk mitigation actions to the Non-Financial Risk Management Committee (NFRMC) on quarterly basis.

(d) Annual review of existing counterparties for their adherence/compliance to Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT)

During 2017, IOD carried out its first “Know Your Customer (KYC)/ Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rules for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for the foreign counterparties” to ensure the compliance with rules and regulations and international best practices in relation to AML and CFT with regard to management of foreign reserves.

16.3 Domestic Foreign Exchange Market Developments

IOD continued to monitor the transactions in the domestic foreign exchange market to ensure its smooth operation and initiated appropriate actions to curb the excess volatility in the USD/LKR exchange rate. Unwinding of the foreign investments in government securities market with the expectation of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve

Bank of USA in March, post Brexit developments in Europe and escalated tension related to North Korea exerted pressure on the Sri Lankan rupee to depreciate in early 2017. The pressure on the exchange rate escalated further due to the debt service payments and increased import demand during the first quarter of 2017. However, with the conversions by exporters and the positive sentiments created through the receipt of the third and fourth tranches under the Extended Fund Facility of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the pressure on the exchange rate eased gradually towards the end of 2017. This was further supported by policy initiative on allowing the market forces to determine the exchange rate with the accommodation of greater flexibility in the exchange rate during the year 2017.

In 2017, total interbank foreign exchange transaction volume has increased to US Dollars 16.45 billion from US Dollars 14.8 billion in 2016 (Table II-23). The aggregate limit on the Net Foreign Exchange Open Position of the Licensed Banks (LBs) remained unchanged at US Dollars 197 million during the year. Further, Central Bank intervention indicated a net purchase position of US Dollars 1,664.35 million during the year as compared to the net sales of US Dollars 768.16 million in 2016 (Table II-24).

In 2017, an integrated market monitoring system named “Central Integrated Market Monitor (CIMM)” was developed to improve the existing domestic interbank foreign exchange reporting system, in collaboration with the Information Technology and Domestic Operations Departments with a view to strengthen the real time reporting and monitoring of interbank transactions. This new reporting system is linked with the Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters trading platforms and market participating institutions to automatically capture the interbank FX transactions, and is operational with effect from 2 January 2018.

18. MACROPRUDENTIAL SURVEILLANCE

Macroprudential Surveillance Department (MSD) has been equipped with resources and data to assess systemic risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system with utmost objectivity since its inception in 2007. Complementing Central Bank’s objective of maintaining financial system stability, the Department has been entrusted with formulating proactive macroprudential policy tools to mitigate risks affecting financial system stability. Various statistical analyses, stress tests on financial institutions, studies relating to interconnectedness amongst key stakeholders in the system and surveys conducted by MSD on the market perception on stability and risks largely contributed towards achieving the said objective. The following are key activities of the Department during the year.

(a) Macroprudential Surveillance

Given its purpose, MSD continued to compile several financial soundness indicators with the objective of assessing the financial soundness of financial institutions such as banks, licensed finance companies and publicly listed companies as well as financial markets and the macroeconomy. In addition, early warning indicator to forecast pressure on the local currency was compiled. Findings of these analyses were regularly submitted to the Monetary Board in the quarterly Board Papers on financial system stability.

In view of the need for granular data for macroprudential analyses, an inter-department technical committee was initiated by MSD to streamline efficient data collection from external parties and conflict free sharing of such data within the Central Bank.

(b) Surveys

A clearly articulated bi-annual Systemic Risk Survey was initiated at the beginning of the year and received immense support from financial sector professionals in identifying the market perception on the potential risks to the financial system and financial system stability. Furthermore, a plan for a household sector survey was laid out due to increasing financial and social concerns on rising indebtedness of households in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, MSD collaborated with the Statistics Department of the Central Bank to conduct the survey on household indebtedness and gather information.

(c) Reports and publications of the Central Bank

Contribution of MSD to statutory reports of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was made by coordinating and

(d) The improved market conditions along with foreign inflows from International Sovereign Bonds, Syndicated Loans and increased foreign investments in T- bills and T- bonds combined with government strategy to settle only the principal amount of maturing T- bonds through domestic sources, enabled the secondary market yield rates to ease during the second half of 2017.

(e) Average Time to Maturity (ATM) of the outstanding domestic debt stock declined to 5.78 years by end 2017 from 5.98 years by end 2016 due to reduction of longer tenure security issuances in view of tightened policy interest rate and liquidity environment.

21.2 Servicing of Government Debt

LankaSecure system is used for settlement of primary and secondary market transactions in government securities. The system consists of 33 Dealer Direct Participants (25 licensed commercial banks and 8 primary dealer companies) maintaining accounts on their own behalf and on behalf of other investors who will be their customers and 3 direct participants (Colombo Stock Exchange, Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Employees’ Provident Fund) who hold accounts on their own behalf only. PDD plays a main role in facilitating settlement by ensuring uninterrupted real-time operation of LankaSecure. The total face value of holdings in scripless securities as at end December 2017 amounted to Rs. 4,912.2 billion. This consisted of Rs.724.7 billion in T-bills and Rs. 4,187.5 billion in T-bonds.

21.4 Maintenance of the Registry in Government Securities

In addition, CDS account holders are provided with the facility to view account details online. As at end December 2017, there were 93,203 registered CDS account holders.

21.5 System Reforms

In order to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency as well as to develop the government securities market, the following system reforms were undertaken during 2017.

(a) T-bonds new issuance process

Effective from July 27, 2017, the Central Bank introduced a new primary issuance system for T- bonds. The new system replaced the fully auction based issuance system for T- bonds that was in practice since February 2015. The main objective of introducing the new system was to further improve the efficiency of the process of funding the Government at least possible cost while maintaining the transparency of the financing arrangement. The new system includes regular monthly T- bond auctions. Each monthly auction offers two T- bond series of different maturities. Further, the new system is carried out in three phases. At Phase I, acceptance of all reasonable market bids within the offered amount under multiple price auction system is explored. Phase II involves a voluntary, volume based bidding for any under allocation in Phase I, vis-a-viz the offered amount. Issuance at this phase takes place at weighted average yield rates (WAYR) determined

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 100

Part II

at Phase I and the allocation is based on the successful performance of auction participants in Phase I, in the event of over subscription. At Phase III, the balance volume, if any, is issued on a mandatory basis at WAYR among Primary Dealers (PD). Allocation of Phase III is inversely proportionate to each PD’s ratio of success at Phase I and Phase II. However, execution of Phase III could be made possible only when at least 60 per cent of the offered amount is accepted at Phase I.

(b) T-bill and T-bond Auction Calendar

PDD published a quarterly calendar for T- bills and T- bonds issuances incorporating the auction date, settlement date, tenor and amount information (for T- Bonds) during the year 2017. This is published in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance based on the financing requirements communicated to the PDD, to enhance the predictability of the primary auction process, to ensure availability of information to investors well in advance and to improve transparency.

21.6 Way forward

(a) Explore the possibility of extending the new primary issuance system for T- bills as well to further improve transparency and efficiency of government borrowings from the domestic market.

(b) Promote the secondary market for SLDBs, by issuing SLDBs in scripless form has been explored together with an electronic bidding arrangement for primary issuances.

(c) To deepen and broaden the secondary market for government securities, preliminary measures have been taken to establish a distinct Electronic Trading Platform (ETP) and Central Counter Party (CCP) arrangement for government securities along with required legal reforms. Further, this will establish a mechanism to disseminate information on debt instruments in the secondary market with a view to enhance transparency and reduce asymmetrical information risk.

(d) Institutionalisation of a Liability Management Framework

The enactment of the Liability Management Act (LMA) is at its latter stages of completion and is expected to come into force in early months of 2018. The Act is expected to institutionalise a formal framework for liability management measures for minimising rollover risk by altering the maturity profile of the outstanding debt stock, with the expectation to improve the underlying risk profile of the government debt stock, to manage the domestic and foreign debt, in a more cost and risk effective manner.

This will enable to proactively address part of the refinancing requirements ahead of time (reduce rollover peaks) and to extend the maturity duration

for commercial borrowings (ISBs). It is also expected to enable the extension of the maturity structure of T-bonds and the smoothening of the coupon payments cycle.

The LMA will provide the legal basis for active liability management initiatives such as buy-backs, switching and pre-funding arrangements. It will also enable to maintain special funds for the proceeds of sale of non-strategic assets.

(e) Measures to strengthen the current legislations

Amendments have been proposed to improve the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance (RSSO) and Local Treasury Bills Ordinance (LTBO) to enhance transparency and to be on par with current market developments. Also, amendments have been suggested to Foreign Loans Act No. 29 of 1957 to be in line with international standards of accounting for external liabilities.

(f) In order to enable diversification of the foreign investor base and to improve the ease of accessing the government securities market for foreign investors, PDD is in the process of exploring feasibility of Euroclearability of Government securities.

21.7 Coordinating Sovereign Rating Review Missions

In 2017, the PDD facilitated international rating agencies (Fitch Ratings Ltd., Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s) for their annual rating reviews in order to ensure availability of international sovereign ratings for Sri Lanka.

22. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Regional Development Department (RDD) embarked on developing and implementing new policy strategies in 2017, further expanding its operations of carrying out conventional credit operations. These new policy strategies and actions were able to strengthen the capacity of RDD as a whole to achieve its objectives of supporting inclusive and balance economic growth and promoting financial inclusiveness in the country.

During 2017, while providing a range of credit supplementary services, RDD continued to coordinate, facilitate and implement various refinance, interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes. These concessionary credit schemes were funded by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL), Donor Agencies and Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs). RDD served individuals and business ventures in a wide spectrum of sectors including Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Microfinance and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sectors by providing affordable finance facilities. These beneficiaries, among other individuals in the target segments, were also benefitted from series of financial literacy and skill development programmes carried out by RDD throughout the year. RDD, with special focus on

Part II - 101

those who have not accessed the formal financial sector, conducted comprehensive awareness building programmes island-wide to increase the level of financial inclusion. In this effort, the effective utilisation of print, electronic and broadcast media by RDD, was highly perceptible during the year.

From the policy perspective, 2017 was a challenging year for RDD as it embarked on introducing several loan schemes to serve different needy segments of the economy and initiating to develop a National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS). During the year, several major projects of high national importance were strategised and implemented by the department utilising its human resources in the fullest capacity. These measures, inter alia, include establishing Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) scheme, initiating the establishment of Smallholder Agribusiness Partnership Programme (SAPP) funded by the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), designing and implementing “Swashakthi – Towards One Million Jobs” loan scheme and two other loan schemes to provide concessionary finance to resume the disaster affected economic activities, namely, “Athwela” loan scheme and the “Post-disaster Economic Activity Recovery Loan (PEARL) scheme under the National Agribusiness Development Project (NADeP). Moreover, measures were taken to amend operating instructions of several loan schemes on need basis.

Further, recognising the importance of operating all stakeholders of the financial system in one direction to improve the financial inclusiveness, actions were initiated to obtain technical assistance of the International Financial Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group in developing the first-ever NFIS in the country, incorporating international exposure and experience.

22.1 Providing Concessionary Financial Facilities

With the intention of increasing financial outreach, RDD continued to expand the credit operations through 15 refinance loan schemes and interest subsidy schemes during 2017. Out of these schemes, three loan schemes, namely, “Swashakthi”, “Athwela” and “PEARL” schemes, were introduced during 2017 with the intention of supporting government employment generation and post-disaster recovery efforts. Information on refinance loan schemes and interest subsidy schemes implemented by RDD, are given in Table II – 23. In addition, RDD established a PCG scheme under the Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project (AMP) which was funded by the World Bank in 2017 with the intention of facilitating to support increasing agriculture, and productivity, efficiency, improving market access, and enhancing value addition of the Agriculture sector in Sri Lanka.

22.5 Initiatives of RDD

(a) Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project (AMP) & the Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) Scheme

With the intention of supporting enhanced agriculture productivity, efficiency, improving market access, and enhancing value addition by the all stakeholders, the AMP is implemented in Sri Lanka with the funding of the International Development Association (IDA) incorporating various organisational stakeholders into a single platform. The development objective of the AMP is to support increasing agriculture productivity, efficiency, improving market access, and enhancing value addition of formal farmers, farmer groups, smallholder producer organizations, cooperatives, companies, producer associations and agribusinesses SMEs in the project areas. The AMP is consists of three components, namely, Agriculture Value Chain Development, Productivity Enhancement and Diversification and Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation.

Overall policy oversight, guidance and project monitoring for the AMP is expected to be given by the Central Project Coordination Committee established under the MNPEA. The implementing agencies for the AMP will be the Ministry of Primary Industries and the Ministry of Agriculture while the PCG Scheme under the Agriculture Value Chain Development component of the AMP, will be operated by RDD of the Central Bank, on behalf of the GOSL. The Director of RDD has been empowered with the authority to operate the PCG Scheme as the administrator.

The PCG Scheme, which is expected to act as an innovative risk sharing tool that mainly covers the PFIs against the risk of debt service default by sub-borrowers, will address the current and changing needs of financial intermediaries while supporting the development objective

of the AMP . In this context, PCG scheme is expected to leverage investments from formal farmers, farmer groups, smallholder producer organizations, cooperatives, companies, producer associations and agribusinesses SMEs for higher value agriculture production and value addition.

While addressing the issues faced by the farmers and agribusiness entrepreneurs with regard to the collateral requirements of PFIs in the process of funding their farming or business, PCG Scheme will address the issues of intermediary financial service providers in areas such as portfolio concentration risks and the capital requirements for cushioning against lending risks to the agriculture sector. Accordingly, the PCG scheme will focus on increasing access to finance, encourage PFIs to lend to the agriculture sector, covering part of the default risk of the PFIs and encouraging longer term lending for asset acquisition.

(b) Developing a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion

Identifying the importance of incorporating international exposure and experience to spur the financial inclusion in the country, the Central Bank sought out the technical assistance of the IFC, a World Bank Group member, to develop a comprehensive National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS). Accordingly, in January 2018, the Central Bank signed a Cooperation Agreement with IFC in this regard.

The proposed NFIS is aimed to promote a more effective and efficient process to improve financial inclusion across the country. The technical assistance obtained from the IFC will provide an imperative opportunity to introduce an evidence-based, prioritised, better resourced, and more comprehensive approach to expanding access to financial services.

Through the implementation of the NFIS, it is expected to expand the retail payments infrastructure, encourage the use of a diverse set of financial services, improve consumer education, and to enhance the enabling environment for the provision of financial services, in short-run. Over the medium-term, the country will be able to achieve an inclusive financial system in which every adult and enterprise have access to, and are able to make full use of a range of adequate, quality, and affordable financial services.

22.6 Skills Development and Capacity Building

The imperative need for skills development and capacity building of the general public cannot be undermined by any principal organisation that intends to promote financial inclusion. RDD, having identified the paramount importance of developing effective strategies and delivering effective financial literacy and awareness, conducted 150 awareness

23. REGIONAL OFFICE MANAGEMENT

The Central Bank has established six Regional Offices (ROO) in terms of Section 7 of the Monetary Law Act, with a view to encourage and promote the development of the productive resources and to provide a better service to the general public. Accordingly, the Central Bank has established ROO in Matara, Anuradhapura, Matale, Trincomalee, Kilinochchi and Nuwara Eliya. At present, Regional Offices engage in coordinating financial institutions at regional level and conducting various training and awareness programmes, identifying viable economic activities in the respective regions and extending the Central Bank activities regionally.

23.1 Development Related Activities

During the year 2017, ROO engaged in various activities such as conducting awareness programmes, training and capacity building programmes to promote a more sustainable and balanced regional development with a view to reduce regional disparities.

24. RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management has become critical for all levels of decision making in the Central Bank, as the Central Bank is exposed to a number of risks in the course of carrying out its multi-faceted operations and dealings with internal and external parties. As such, managing risk in the Central Bank is carried out within a three lines of defense structure, where the responsibility of the first line of defense lies with the respective business owners or the departments. The second line of defense is the independent risk management function which is responsible for assessing, monitoring and reporting of financial risks. The third line of defense is the Internal Audit function that provides an independent, objective assurance to the Monetary Board on first and second line operations. As the second line of defense, the Risk Management Department (RMD) continued to perform its independent risk management function during the year, while taking initiatives to further strengthen the Risk Governance Framework in the Central Bank.

RMD has undertaken the tasks assigned to the department in a phase by phase manner. During the year, RMD

was mainly engaged in assessing, monitoring and reporting financial risks with respect to the foreign reserves investment, and investments by the internal funds managed by the Finance Department. In addition, RMD has taken initiatives to undertake risk management function pertaining to investments of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and worked on certain prerequisites required for moving towards an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework.

The key functions performed by the RMD in 2017 are highlighted below.

24.1 Financial Risk of Foreign Reserve Investments

The main financial risks that the Central Bank is exposed to are market risk and credit risk. RMD was engaged in independently assessing, monitoring and reporting of market risk arising from the management of foreign reserves portfolio and ensured the compliance with Investment Policy and parameters specified in the Foreign Reserve Management Guidelines (FRMG). The market risk exposure of Fixed Income Security (FIS) portfolio was estimated by using Duration and Value at Risk (VaR), ensuring that risk levels were maintained within the specified targets.

Exposure to counterparty credit risk was monitored on a daily basis, based on credit ratings issued by Fitch Ratings, Standard and Poors’ and Moody’s Analytics. Accordingly, several counterparty exposure limits, issuer limits and product limits were revised during the year in line with rating changes, in accordance with the Counterparty Credit Risk Management Guidelines (CCRMG) to gauge the potential risk of default by counterparties and issuers in meeting their obligations. The RMD worked closely with the International Operations Department (IOD) in such a way to ensure that all investment transactions of the IOD were carried out within the limits structure assigned to eligible issuers and counterparties based on their respective risk levels.

Given that money market counterparties are more vulnerable to credit risk than those dealing with only FIS, movements of Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads and Stock Market (SM) prices of active money market counterparties were evaluated on a daily basis categorizing their level of risk as High, Moderate or Low through corresponding traffic light indicators, Red, Amber and Green. These were informed to IOD facilitating them to take into account such information in investing in short term funds with the money market counterparties. RMD prepared monthly reports summarising CDS spread and SM price trends of money market counterparties and highlighted risk events in the international arena along with their potential implications, in order to identify new sources of risk.

RMD presented risk measurements and assessments pertaining to foreign reserves to Foreign Reserve Management Committee (FRMC) meetings on monthly basis, and submitted quarterly risk reports to the

Introduction

Central Banks are conventionally viewed as risk-averse institutions. However, this notion is no longer valid as Central Banks have gradually become highly adept in recognizing the full range of risks confronted by them, and emerged as risk aware institutions rather than risk-averse institutions. This is on the grounds that Central Banks have undergone a series of transformations over the years, as reflected by the complexities of their operations. The present role of Central Banks has evolved to a more multifaceted mandate, which warrants them to take into account national interests, and other statutory and constitutional responsibilities, in addition to institutional risk and return considerations. On the external front, Central Banks across the globe operate in volatile, uncertain and unpredictable environments, where policy makers have to make an enormous effort to obtain reasonable assurance regarding effective management of risks within their own institutions. Additionally, due to Governance failures and scandals that have occurred in financial markets, public vigilance and expectations in relation to Central Banks have rapidly amplified, making these institutions extremely vulnerable to reputational risk. Hence, the loss of credibility through reputational risk now has a greater negative impact on the effectiveness of Central Bank policies.

In the given context, many Central Banks world-over have sought a reliable, structured and disciplined approach to risk management, and have chosen to adopt “Enterprise-wide Risk Management” (ERM) as an effective strategy to facilitate the management of existing and potential risks across an institution. ERM is essentially an integrated and holistic effort, where each and every stakeholder has a distinct role and responsibility for its successful execution. In this process, great importance is placed upon inculcating highest governance standards within the institution.

Governance in Central Banks

Governance in Central Banks is an issue that has been in the limelight for well over a decade, yet its effective application is debatable, due to real-life challenges confronted in putting sound governance into practice. Nevertheless, the strategic significance of this concept cannot be undermined, not only due to the many benefits it offers, but also since Central Banks preach and mandate regulated institutions under their supervision to adhere to governance guidelines imposed by them, giving rise to a moral obligation of the highest priority. Despite the issues coupled with its effective implementation, governance is viewed as one of ERM’s key pillars of success. Governance and ERM go hand-in-hand, complement each other, and benefit from each other.

BOX 13Aligning Governance and Enterprise-wide Risk Management of Central Banks

Governance as a facilitator for ERM

Governance refers to how an organization is directed and managed, including the consideration and management of risk. Effective governance nurtures on the pillars of “Direction”, “Independence”, “Accountability” and “Transparency “and these are the basic prerequisites for the successful execution of an ERM Framework as well. The Board and the Senior Management must set the tone at the top, clearly indicating their commitment and direction with regard to Risk Management. The Risk Governance Framework must facilitate operational, functional and reporting independence wherever necessary. Accountabilities of all stakeholders under ERM must be predefined, including the role of the Board, committees, departments and individuals. Transparency in decision-making by the Board, committees and senior management must be ensured by establishing channels of communication with both internal and external focus. Determining clear reporting lines, decision structures, information flows, roles and responsibilities at the very beginning allow stakeholders of ERM to be more focused and efficient. It prevents unnecessary bureaucratic procedures and personal disagreements that lead to a delay in the implementation of ERM, waste of resources and disturbance of institutional harmony.

ERM as a facilitator of Governance

ERM helps understand uncertainties, highlights opportunities, prevents waste of effort, prioritizes activities and controls, and paves way for timely, informed, participative and risk aware decision-making. To safeguard the long-term viability and reputation of a Central Bank, the Board and the senior management must possess a shared understanding of risk. This is a vital feature of good governance, for which ERM is considered as an effective implementation mechanism. Literature on Central Bank governance reveals that there are many ways in which poor governance itself poses a threat to an institution. Few out of many such factors contributing to poor governance or governance risks are, the Board focusing on day-to-day management rather than on strategy; quality of information provided to the Board being inferior, delayed, inadequate or too voluminous; and not having a proper strategic plan for the institution or the plan in place being improperly executed. In addition, the Board being too small or large, lacking extensiveness, and complexity of required skills and knowledge; the Board being incompetent or disengaged, not having properly reviewed and approved policies and procedures in place, and risks being ignored or poorly managed are also considered as contributory factors to poor governance in Central Banks. The implementation of an effective ERM Framework would ensure that highest governance standards are in place and practiced within the institution.

Monetary Board. In addition, the RMD evaluated new proposals relevant to foreign reserves investments, from risk management perspective and provided inputs for the preparation of Strategic Asset Allocation. During the year, RMD engaged in reviewing the existing FRMG and drafting Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for foreign reserves in line with developments under the World Bank Reserves Advisory Management Program (RAMP) and in line with ERM Framework to be implemented from 2018.

24.2 Internal Investment Funds

RMD was involved in analyzing investments of Internal Investment funds from a risk management perspective, and checking its compliance with the existing guidelines and giving recommendations for strengthening risk management practices wherever necessary. This analysis was carried out on a monthly basis and quarterly risk reports were submitted to the Monetary Board. RMD is in the process of developing the IPS and reviewing existing Investment Guidelines (IGs) in line with ERM Framework to be implemented in the Central Bank.

24.3 Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF)

RMD was also entrusted with the task of monitoring financial risks pertaining to investments of the EPF, and as an initial step towards this, RMD has conducted a study on the prevailing risk management framework related to the fund management activities of the EPF department and submitted its recommendations for further improvement of investment and risk management processes and procedures. RMD has already initiated reviewing of the existing IPS and Investment and Trading Guidelines (ITG) of EPF.

24.4 Initiatives for Moving towards an ERM Framework

As a further step towards strengthening the risk management function and risk management culture in the Central Bank, RMD made initiatives to establish an ERM framework for the Central Bank with the intention of implementing it during the strategic planning period of 2018-2020. At the annual strategic planning process of the Central Bank, ERM was identified as one of the key strategic priorities of the Central Bank, offering more weight and prominence to this task. RMD engaged in capacity building related to ERM,

The way Forward – Central Bank of Sri Lanka

ERM has received wide recognition from many Central Banks around the globe as it is considered a successful approach for managing risks, embedded with its key feature of the highest governance standards. Realizing the importance of adopting an effective Risk Management Framework within the Bank, in line with novel trends in Central Banking, “Implementing an ERM Framework within the CBSL” has been identified as one of the key strategic priorities of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, in its Strategic Plan for 2018-2020.

The initial step in moving towards ERM involves the strategic implementation of a “Risk Governance Framework” within the Bank. In this regard, the CBSL has already formed a Risk Governance Framework, to be implemented in 2018, which consists of Risk Management and Risk Governance structures. The Risk Management Structure comprises the “three lines of defense” model for risk management. The three lines of the defense structure provides a clear demarcation of functions among three groups. The first line comprises business owners responsible for identifying, assessing and managing risks, ensuring that appropriate control activities are enforced and monitored for compliance. The second line comprises risk and compliance functions responsible for facilitation, independent oversight over risk and compliance related issues, and formulation of common risk, and compliance policies and guidelines. The third line comprises the audit function, which provides an independent, objective assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of first and second line operations. Each line of defense analyzes and presents risk related information from their own distinct perspective, allowing

the Board to develop a holistic view, assisting them to carry out decision-making in a well-informed, risk-aware manner, capitalizing on the combined assurance received under the new Framework.

The Risk Governance structure comprises a committee structure, which facilitates independent reporting, oversight and risk governance. Information to be reported to the Monetary Board flows through the Risk Governance Structure, which consists of an executive level risk committee and Board sub committees. These committees are established to facilitate participative decision making, while safeguarding objectivity and independence in information reporting and decision-making processes. The committee structure assists the Board to fulfill its governance and risk oversight responsibilities by having access to reliable, complete and timely information.

Conclusion

ERM has been recognized by Central Banks world-over as a highly effective mechanism for managing risks across institutions. It contributes to the attainment of institutional goals and objectives in a more collective and organized manner.

Nevertheless, even the best mechanism can fail, if implemented in an environment where governance is not given due prominence. Governance is essentially a prerequisite for ERM, and many Central Banks across the world, including the Central Bank of Sri Lanka have formed Risk Governance Frameworks, in order to lay a solid foundation for implementing them successfully, thus aligning Governance and ERM.

by organizing workshops with the assistance of Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) with a view of inculcating risk culture within the Central Bank, and appointing risk officers for each department to coordinate with RMD regarding risk related matters, etc. During the year, RMD engaged in designing and developing a new Risk Governance Framework consisting of Risk Governance and Risk Management Structures which is considered as the basic foundation for an ERM to operate effectively in the Bank.

24.5 Non-Financial Risk

RMD prepared the Central Bank risk profile combining Non–Financial Risks pertaining to 17 Departments that are members of the Non-Financial Risk Management Committee. Identified risks have been classified under three main risk categories i.e. policy risk, operational risk and other non- financial risks and RMD developed and presented an analysis of these risks using the three by three risk matrix and risk categorising mechanisms.

24.6 Daily Market Information

RMD continued to escalate the daily analyses of market conditions to the Governor, which comprises of market liquidity conditions, short term interest rate movements in the domestic money market, cash flows and price changes in the international market with its impact on international reserves, yield curve behavior of government securities market and government borrowing requirements.

24.7 Other Activities

RMD concentrated on capacity building of the staff and in this regard, technical knowledge of the staff members was enhanced under the World Bank RAMP Program, which enables the RMD to further improve its work in line with internationally accepted standards. In addition, the departmental presentations by staff members helped in sharing knowledge apart from regular training programmes. Further, RMD staff was involved in updating the Treasury Management System administered by IOD, from a risk management perspective.

These welfare facilities included provision of loans under the Staff Housing (Mortgage) Loan Scheme, Provident Fund Loan Scheme and Staff Benefit Scheme; reimbursement of expenses under the

Employer Contributory Medical Benefit Scheme (MBS) and provision of Medical Centre and Restaurant facilities. The number of registered beneficiaries under MBS consisting of employees, pensioners, their registered dependents together with widows/widowers was approximately 10,000 as at end 2017.

During 2017, SSMD granted 2,026 loans which included Housing Loans, Provident Fund Loans, Vehicle Loans, Computer Loans and other loans under the Staff Benefit Scheme. SSMD took measures to grant these loans within a stipulated time frame after receiving the application together with all relevant documents by the applicant. The loan monitoring system enabled effective supervision of loan disbursement to employees.

The Central Bank restaurant continued to improve its services for the Central Bank staff, to the possible highest quality. Further, measures were taken to improve the condition of the restaurants and restaurant facilities during 2017.

SSMD continued to reimburse medical expenses incurred by all registered beneficiaries under MBS. The total amount of reimbursement of medical expenditure increased by five per cent in 2017 compared to the previous year. A system was introduced to send an email notification to employees and retired employees informing the status of their claims to reimburse medical bills. The medical facilities at the Medical Centre were made available to the Central Bank employees during working hours by outsourcing such services. Medical tests and laboratory service facilities were also provided at the Medical Centre at a reasonable charge. During the year, SSMD conducted six awareness programmes to enhance the knowledge of the Central Bank staff on important health issues. Further, member fees and the limits of benefits of Death Relief Fund and Death Donation Scheme were revised in 2017.

28. STATISTICS

28.1 Collecting Data through Surveys and Other Data Sources

(a) Business Sentiment Surveys

Business Outlook Survey (BOS) was continued on a quarterly basis during 2017 to monitor current economic situation and to capture the short term market developments, which serve as the basis for future economic developments. The target population of this survey was large scale enterprises covering three major activities (Agriculture, Industry and Services) of the economy.

Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) Survey for Manufacturing and Services activities was conducted on a monthly basis to use as early indicators in GDP forecasting. Further, such indices could be used by researchers, economic analysts, industry experts, business decision-makers as additional information to help better understand industry conditions. For PMI Survey for Manufacturing activities, the purchasing managers of the manufacturing industries and for PMI Survey for Services activities, suitable officers with an overall knowledge of the business activities of the firms were the target population. The survey was carried out during the last week of each month targeting responses from 100 institutions each from both Manufacturing and Services sectors of the economy predominantly concentrated in the Western province.

PMI Survey was extended to construction sector during 2017 to gain an insight into the developments in the construction industry by tracking different variables. The selection of the sample for this survey was based on the list of construction companies registered with the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA). The survey was conducted on a monthly basis from June 2017 in order to develop a high frequency indicator with the objective of strengthening the growth forecast related to the construction industry.

Credit Conditions Survey, which was designed to capture demand and supply side developments in the credit market, was also continued during the year 2017. This consists of a Credit Demand Survey to capture the demand side developments and a Credit Supply Survey to capture the supply side developments of the credit market. With regard to the Credit Demand Survey, the target population was obtained from the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of the economy in the Western province and in provinces in which the Central Bank has its regional presence. The Credit Supply Survey covers all Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialised Banks of the country. The results of Credit Conditions Survey were reported to the management on a semi-annual basis to facilitate policy formulation.

(b) Inflation Expectations Survey

Inflation Expectations Survey was conducted by the Department on a monthly basis since its introduction in 2006. The current survey includes three main categories of respondents;

Corporate Sector, Household Sector and the Academia, whereas the Academia was added to the respondent base during the latter part of 2017. STD completed the re-sampling process of the respondent base during 2017, particularly in the Corporate Sector. Respondents provided both quantitative and qualitative information on current inflation perceptions and inflation expectations for the period of 12 months ahead. The results of the survey on monthly basis were reported to the management to be used for policy decision making.

(c) Labour Force Information and Public Sector Employment Survey

With regard to overall labour market data analysis, information obtained from the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) and other data providers, were analysed with respect to employment, unemployment, foreign employment, labour relations, labour market reforms and labour productivity in the country. Collaborative data sharing was carried out with national and international agencies in order to assist the policy formulation process.

Public Sector Employment Survey was conducted on a semi-annual basis covering all public sector institutions to ascertain the developments in the public sector employment. However, since the Department of Management Services (DMS) of the Ministry of Finance also conducts a similar survey, DMS has agreed to provide the required data pertaining to public sector employment at pre-decided intervals commencing from 2018. The data collected from the survey were published through the annual publications of the CBSL for the information of the general public.

(d) Private Sector Health Services Survey

STD has initiated this survey with the objective of introducing a new index to capture data on private sector health services to improve GDP forecasting. In this connection, a census targeting hospitals registered under Private Health Services Regulatory Council was first completed to enumerate the number of patients treated by private hospitals and medical centers in Sri Lanka as a part of the exercise to identify a suitable sample to represent the private health activities in the country. Based on the census results, a sample survey was conducted starting from second quarter of 2017 on a quarterly basis to collect monthly information on number of out-patients as well as admissions. This survey captures the developments in private health services as a volume indicator to forecast the value added growth in private sector health services.

(e) Super Market Retail Trade Survey

Identifying the future potential of modern retail trade activities of the country, the Department initiated a survey during 2017 targeting the key supermarket chains operating in the country. The objective of this survey was to compile a volume indicator that would help to track the trends in supermarket retail trade activities to be included as a new

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 113

indicator in STD’s indicator based GDP forecasting. Further, it is expected to be used as a proxy to analyse consumer spending patterns of the economy.

(f) Condominium Market Survey

Since January 2017, a web based and a telephone based survey was conducted on a monthly basis covering major condominium property developers in the market, to collect advertised sales prices of condominiums, to identify the number of upcoming condominium units and to recognise the sales levels in both completed and ongoing projects. However, due to the unavailability of transacted prices and inability to identify the reasons for the price movements through these sources, STD decided to launch a questionnaire-based survey on a quarterly basis. Hence, towards the latter part of the year, initial arrangements were carried out to conduct the survey targeting condominium developers to collect information on actual sales prices, the demand, reasons for price changes, number of existing and upcoming housing units, level of occupancy in projects, buyer portfolio information and forward-looking perceptions of the developers. This information would assist in predicting the price trends providing insights for policy formulation purposes. A preliminary survey was launched in September 2017 and incorporating the feedback received from the participants, STD started the survey on a quarterly basis from 2018. Further, through this survey, the Department intends to maintain a close rapport with the market players in order to monitor the regular developments of the sector.

(g) Country Wide Data Collection System

A Country-Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS), which commenced in 1978, was continued during the year 2017 with regular collection of information on retail prices and producer prices of consumer goods, daily wages of the informal private sector and approximations on future production levels of agriculture and fisheries commodities on a weekly, monthly and quarterly basis. Data collected under the system are extensively used for analysing seasonal variations and regional differences in prices and wages; compilation of price indices, Provincial Gross Domestic Product and Sri Lanka Prosperity Index; forecasting price movements; evaluation of the impact of policy changes on prices; estimation of national expenditure and income; and dissemination of price and wage data to the general public.

Under the existing system, the data were collected through government school teachers, who serve as data investigators for data collection centres covering the island. Further, the system utilises services of non-teacher data investigators to report data on wholesale and retail prices from Pettah Market, Maradagahamula Rice Market, Dambulla and Narahenpita Special Economic Centers and Negombo and Peliyagoda Fish Markets on a daily and weekly basis. In order to strengthen the management information system,

the Department collected the wholesale and retail prices of a range of food commodities directly from selected markets as well and published for general information on a daily basis.

Initiatives were also taken during 2017 to revamp the existing CWDCS to a system of highly time bound data collection, transmission, aggregation and dissemination arrangement with high quality. The main objective of this process was to collect retail prices to facilitate forecasting of movements of National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) on time for policy making process. Seminars for training were conducted during the fourth quarter 2017 for the Teacher Investigators (TIs) network on the e-data collection arrangement under the new system. Tablet computers with a data collection Application (App) were introduced for all TIs together with hands-on-experience during these seminars. The electronic data collection platform under the upgraded system officially commenced on 01 January 2018.

28.2 Compiling Indices

(a) Business Sentiment Indices

Based on the results of BOS, Business Sentiment Indices namely; Business Condition, Profitability, Skilled Labour Availability, Sales, Demand and Capacity Utilisation were compiled. The results were presented to the MPC and a detailed report was submitted to the management for policy making purposes. Further, selected indices were published quarterly in aggregate form on the CBSL website for the information of the external users.

PMI Manufacturing with the sub-indices of New Orders, Production, Employment, Suppliers’ Delivery Time and Stock of Purchases, and PMI Services with sub-indices of New Businesses, Business Activity, Employment, Backlogs of Work and Expectations for Activity were compiled assessing the month-on-month change and reported to the MPC and senior management for policy decision making and issued press notices for the general public.

(b) Property Price Indices

Compiling of the Land Price Index (LPI) was continued on a semi-annual basis during 2017 using valuation data obtained from the Valuation Department for 51 sub-divisions in Colombo, Dehiwala, Homagama, Kaduwela and Kesbewa Divisional Secretariat divisions. Three separate indices were compiled covering residential, commercial and industrial properties, while the overall LPI was the simple average of these sub-indices. In addition, STD has taken several initiatives to improve the coverage of real estate property indices by improving the existing indices both geographically and methodologically. Moreover, the land price report was published for the first time during 2017 for the information of the general public.

The Department has also initiated compiling a new index using the sales price information gathered through the web-based Condominium Market Survey. The index was compiled on a

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2017

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 114

Part II

monthly basis since January 2017, using publicly available information to monitor price movements in the condominium property market covering Colombo district and submitted for monetary policy purposes. The information obtained through the recently launched questionnaire-based Condominium Market Survey would enable to explain the movements of the existing index and to compile a new index based on the actual transacted prices.

(c) Wage Indices

STD compiled wage rate indices to assess the movements of salaries and wages in the economy. In this regard, the wage movements of the public, formal private and informal private sectors were analysed separately. Nominal and real wage rate indices for the public sector were compiled based on the public administration salary circulars. For the formal private sector, real wage rate indices were compiled using the nominal wage rate indices provided by the Department of Labour for the employees in the Wage Boards Trades. To address several shortcomings of the existing indices, STD commenced to compile a new index that represents wage trends of the formal private sector employees during 2017. Informal private sector wage movements were analysed in terms of the informal private sector wage rate index compiled based on information collected through CWDCS.

28.3 Forecasting Key Macroeconomic Variables

STD forecasts short term consumer price inflation and economic growth using model and non-model techniques. These forecasts were analysed and discussed at the Staff Level Meetings, Pre-MPC, MPC and submitted to the Monetary Board to facilitate policy decision making.

The short term inflation forecasts were mainly based on recent price trends, econometric techniques and expected price movements associated with market developments. The Department continuously explored new variables that reflect both supply and demand side impact on inflation to improve the inflation forecasting models. Moreover, the inflation forecasts were updated frequently in line with the realised and perceived changes in variables which impact inflation based on the movements of observed consumer prices, along with the developments in input and output prices as reflected through findings of surveys conducted by the Department.

Growth forecasts were prepared on a quarterly basis, using primary and secondary data related to each sub activity of the economy based on indicator as well as model based techniques. Leading economic indicators, survey findings and other information related to sub activities of the economy were combined with expert judgment for indicator based forecasts. In order to strengthen the model based short term forecasts, a short term Dynamic Factor Model was introduced during 2017 to its pool of techniques.

In addition to the in-house forecasting framework, STD continuously contributed to the Forecasting and Policy Analysis

System (FPAS) of the Central Bank, which was developed jointly with ERD under the technical assistance of IMF, with required short term forecasts of inflation and GDP, relevant analysis and other information.

28.4 Compiling Regional Statistics

(a) Sri Lanka Prosperity Index

To assess the overall status of prosperity in the country and in each of its provinces, STD continued to compile Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI) during 2017. This is a composite indicator reflecting the economic and social developments in the country and its provinces. SLPI comprises of three sub-indices namely; Economic and Business Climate, Well-being of the People and Socio-Economic Infrastructure, which are measured using 43 representative variables. In order to improve the representation of the country’s overall prosperity, the Department is constantly exploring ways to improve the variables and methods of SLPI. Accordingly, during 2017 a new variable to measure the female participation among the provincial council members was included to the Socio-Economic Infrastructure segment, for strengthening the quality of the index.

(b) Provincial Gross Domestic Product

STD continued to estimate Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP) in nominal terms by disaggregating the National Accounts estimates of the DCS, using relevant indicators at provincial level. The figures for 2016 and recompiled figures for 2015 were published in October 2017. The Department regularly explores suitable indicators at provincial level to distribute the national figures and improve the reliability of estimates. Composite indicators were also used, where appropriate, with the intention of gradually integrating most up-to-date statistics. Consequently, during 2017 modifications were introduced to the GDP line items relating to construction, wholesale and retail trade, financial services and insurance activities.

28.5 Dissemination of Information

During 2017, STD has taken a leap forward in data dissemination by launching the “Data Library” via the Central Bank website for the benefit of external data users. This was the further improved version of the electronic database, which was developed with the technical assistance from ITD to meet the internal data requirements. The database consists of time series data on a variety of areas spanning across Real, Monetary, Fiscal, External and Financial sectors collected from nine internal Departments and several external institutions.

Further, the Department released its two main annual publications namely; “Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 2017 – Volume XXXIX” and “Sri Lanka Socio Economic Data 2017 – Volume XL” in August and September respectively in all three languages in both printed and electronic forms. STD continued to publish Daily Price Reports of selected

Part II

consumer items, Weekly and Monthly Economic Indicators promptly via the Central Bank website during 2017. The Department contributed to two chapters of the Central Bank Annual Report and Recent Economic Developments report and provided data to the Monthly Bulletin of the Central Bank. Moreover, information was disseminated by way of press releases to the public at large and knowledge sharing exercises were also conducted throughout the year.

28.6 Tracking Sri Lanka’s Position in Global Rankings

(a) “Ease of Doing Business” Ranking

The new working committee established in 2016 under the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, which is now vested with the main responsibility of improving the “Ease of Doing Business” ranking of Sri Lanka, has articulated and published a roadmap for investment climate reforms with the technical assistance of the World Bank. Further, the committee is closely following up with the individual task forces on the progress of implementation the set reforms. In line with these initiatives of the government, STD continued to provide its assistance and hence, during 2017, the Department participated at various meetings/workshops conducted by the working committee to finalise the reform agenda; attended progress related meetings to provide the required inputs; coordinated Sri Lankan participation at International Seminars on improving country positions and disseminated information on a timely manner focusing on variables tracked under the ranking to the relevant authorities.

(b) Other Global Rankings

Global Indices namely; Worldwide Governance Indicators, The Global Competitiveness Index, Index of Economic Freedom, Human Development Index, Economic Freedom of the World Index, Corruption Perceptions Index, Enabling Trade Index and Country risk classification of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were monitored continuously and reports on country positions and strategies to improve rankings were submitted to the management and other higher authorities when required.

30.1 Supervision of LFCs and SLCs

(a) Conduct of Statutory Examinations

i. As planned, DSNBFI conducted 30 annual statutory examinations of LFCs and SLCs during 2017. The main findings of the examinations included low efficiency, issues on corporate governance, inadequate loan loss provisioning, lapses in internal controls, potential credit risks and sustainability issues originated from the business models.

ii. The Monetary Board approved time bound action plans and recommendations of these examinations, were communicated to the respective companies for attention of the Board of Directors and Board sub-committees and follow-up action was undertaken to ensure that LFCs and SLCs take corrective measures within the agreed time frames.

(b) Conduct of Continuous Surveillance

All LFCs and SLCs except for two LFCs which do not conduct business due to on-going liquidity issues of the companies, were continuously supervised based on periodic financial information submitted through the web based Finnet system. In view of improving the assessment process about the financial condition and identifying early warning signs of impending problems, a new continuous surveillance format was developed during the year. During the year, the Finnet return on branch distribution was revised to be in line with the newly issued direction on branch opening, relocation and closure while a new return was introduced to capture the financial information which is based on the new accounting standards. To further support the continuous surveillance, audited reports, management letters, external ratings and press reports were used. DSNBFI identified potential risk areas through an ‘Early Warning System’ and remedial actions were recommended to mitigate such risks. An internal supervisory rating system has also been implemented to rank LFCs based on their financial strength and risk management. The findings of the continuous surveillance and the sector performance were reported to the Monetary Board on a regular basis in view of keeping the senior management well informed of the latest developments in this sector.

Out of the several proposals received by prospective investors for another company, the Monetary Board granted principle approval to implement the capital infusion plan proposed by an investor. For the other

company, DSNBFI continued to negotiate with potential investors while attending extensively on the court case filed by the depositors of the company. In addition, several steps were initiated against three active weak companies by facilitating several prospective investors to proceed with conducting due diligence for capital infusion and to restructure those companies.
