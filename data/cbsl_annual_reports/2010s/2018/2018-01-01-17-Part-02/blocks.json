This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly, GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA \u20132 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018.",

The rate of interest payable is composed of two components; the service charge and a fixed margin. The service charge is calculated weekly, based on the SDR interest rate. The fixed margin is 1 per cent per annum for the outstanding loan amount up to 300 per cent of the quota with the IMF. When the outstanding loan amount exceeds 300 per cent of the quota, a surcharge of 2 per cent per annum will be levied on the outstanding in excess of 300 per cent. The first repayment of SDR 25.80 Mn was made on 25 October 2012.",

There are uncollateralized investments under Pension, Widows\u2019 and Orphans\u2019 fund, Widowers\u2019 and Orphans\u2019 fund, Gratuity and Medical Benefit Scheme fund worth of Rs. 485.79 Mn for which 100% provision has been made and thus not included in the value of plan assets.

The MD measures the change in price of a security for a given change in the interest rates (yield).A higher MD indicates a higher risk.

VaR gives a number, in terms of money, which can be aggregated across risks and positions. The Bank uses historical simulation method to calculate VaR number for 10 days period at 99% confidence interval. The historical method for estimating VaR is sometimes referred to as the historical simulation method. As an example to calculate the 5% daily VaR using the historical method is to accumulate a number of past daily returns, rank the returns from highest to lowest, and identify the lowest 5% of returns. The highest of these lowest 5% of returns is the 1-day, 5% VaR.",

This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Treasury Bills with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Treasury Bills to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Treasury Bills in the Bank\u2019s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank\u2019s actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Treasury Bill portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank\u2019s Treasury Bill portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets",

Accordingly, as the secretariat of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), ERD facilitated its deliberations with its comprehensive forward looking analyses of economic and monetary conditions using continued surveillance of model based macroeconomic projections, macroeconomic statistics and estimates together with expert judgement, enabling the MPC to provide proactive policy advice to the Monetary Board in the conduct of monetary policy. ERD assisted the Governor to prepare the annual policy statement on \u201cMonetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2017 and Beyond\u201d (Road Map), where the CBSL announced that the conduct of monetary policy will be strengthened through the move towards a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework to preserve price stability with a medium term focus within a market based exchange rate system, while supporting real sector stability. In line with this decision, ERD incorporated a forward looking policy analysis and medium-term outlook into the monetary policy process based on its medium-term model projections at MPC meetings since June 2017. Several inter-departmental and staff level pre MPC discussions were also added to the monetary policy decision making process. Meanwhile, the number of MPC meetings per annum was reduced from 12 to 8, allowing more time for the staff to conduct deeper economic analysis and provide better inputs to the MPC and the Monetary Board. These changes are expected to facilitate the CBSL to gradually prepare for the move towards FIT. The CBSL re-established the Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC), with ERD providing secretariat assistance to the Committee, in order to obtain stakeholders\u2019 views and align the policies in a way that is mutually beneficial to stakeholders and the Central Bank.

The FIS portfolio consists of highly rated government securities, government guaranteed securities, securities of government agencies and supranational institutions. Transactions undertaken by IOD for reserve management purposes, are performed with Central Banks, highly rated commercial banks and investment houses, which are counterparties approved by FRMC as per the parameters stipulated in the Counterparty Credit Risk Management System (CCRMS) subject to the necessary limit allocations by the Risk Management Department, paying due consideration to the strength and creditworthiness of each counterparty. The key factors considered in determining the asset and currency compositions of the foreign reserves portfolio constitute liquidity requirements and debt service payments while risk management parameters, income generating abilities and specific directions of the Monetary Board are also considered.",

The new system includes regular monthly T- bond auctions. Each monthly auction offers two T- bond series of different maturities. Further, the new system is carried out in three phases. At Phase I, acceptance of all reasonable market bids within the offered amount under multiple price auction system is explored. Phase II involves a voluntary, volume based bidding for any under allocation in Phase I, vis-a-viz the offered amount.

This is on the grounds that Central Banks have undergone a series of transformations over the years, as reflected by the complexities of their operations. The present role of Central Banks has evolved to a more multifaceted mandate, which warrants them to take into account national interests, and other statutory and constitutional responsibilities, in addition to institutional risk and return considerations. On the external front, Central Banks across the globe operate in volatile, uncertain and unpredictable environments, where policy makers have to make an enormous effort to obtain reasonable assurance regarding effective management of risks within their own institutions. Additionally, due to Governance failures and scandals that have occurred in financial markets, public vigilance and expectations in relation to Central Banks have rapidly amplified, making these institutions extremely vulnerable to reputational risk. Hence, the loss of credibility through reputational risk now has a greater negative impact on the effectiveness of Central Bank policies.",

To safeguard the long-term viability and reputation of a Central Bank, the Board and the senior management must possess a shared understanding of risk. This is a vital feature of good governance, for which ERM is considered as an effective implementation mechanism. Literature on Central Bank governance reveals that there are many ways in which poor governance itself poses a threat to an institution. Few out of many such factors contributing to poor governance or governance risks are, the Board focusing on day-to-day management rather than on strategy; quality of information provided to the Board being inferior, delayed, inadequate or too voluminous; and not having a proper strategic plan for the institution or the plan in place being improperly executed. In addition, the Board being too small or large, lacking extensiveness, and complexity of required skills and knowledge; the Board being incompetent or disengaged, not having properly reviewed and approved policies and procedures in place, and risks being ignored or poorly managed are also considered as contributory factors to poor governance in Central Banks.

Hence, towards the latter part of the year, initial arrangements were carried out to conduct the survey targeting condominium developers to collect information on actual sales prices, the demand, reasons for price changes, number of existing and upcoming housing units, level of occupancy in projects, buyer portfolio information and forward-looking perceptions of the developers. This information would assist in predicting the price trends providing insights for policy formulation purposes. A preliminary survey was launched in September 2017 and incorporating the feedback received from the participants, STD started the survey on a quarterly basis from 2018.

During the year, the Finnet return on branch distribution was revised to be in line with the newly issued direction on branch opening, relocation and closure while a new return was introduced to capture the financial information which is based on the new accounting standards. To further support the continuous surveillance, audited reports, management letters, external ratings and press reports were used. DSNBFI identified potential risk areas through an \u2018Early Warning System\u2019 and remedial actions were recommended to mitigate such risks. An internal supervisory rating system has also been implemented to rank LFCs based on their financial strength and risk management. The findings of the continuous surveillance and the sector performance were reported to the Monetary Board on a regular basis in view of keeping the senior management well informed of the latest developments in this sector.",
