6.1 OverviewT

he revenue based fiscal consolidation

strategy continued in 2017 with emphasis

placed on revenue enhancing tax reforms

to reduce the budget deficit and the debt burden

of the government. Accordingly, tax revenue as

a percentage of GDP increased to 12.6 per cent

in 2017 from 12.3 per cent in 2016 reflecting the

impact of adjustments made to major tax revenue

sources in the previous year. However, total

revenue as a percentage of GDP declined to

13.8 per cent in 2017 from 14.2 per cent in 2016

due to a reduction in non tax revenue. The non tax

revenue to GDP ratio declined mainly due to the

lower revenue collection stemming from the lack

of dividend transfers by State Owned Business

Enterprises (SOBEs) owing to their weak financial

performance. Meanwhile, total expenditure and net

lending also reduced to 19.4 per cent of GDP in

2017 from 19.6 per cent of GDP in the previous

year reflecting a reduction in recurrent expenditure.

Recurrent expenditure reduced to 14.5 per cent of

GDP in 2017 from 14.8 per cent of GDP in 2016

largely due to the subdued growth in salaries and

wages, and current transfer payments. However,

interest payments as a percentage of GDP

increased to 5.5 per cent in 2017 from 5.1 per cent

in 2016. The primary balance of the budget, which

reflects the difference between revenue and non

interest expenditure, was in surplus in 2017. This

was a key achievement in budgetary operations

in 2017 as the government was able to record a

surplus in the primary balance for the first time

since 1992 and only the second time since 1955.

The surplus in the primary balance shows that the

entire non interest expenditure of the government

in 2017 was met out of revenue receipts with a

surplus remaining. The primary surplus achieved

in 2017 also exceeded the primary deficit target of

Rs. 23.0 billion set as a Quantitative Performance

Criteria (QPC) under the Extended Fund Facility

(EFF) programme of the International Monetary

Fund (IMF). Meanwhile, the current account deficit,

which constitutes the difference between revenue

and recurrent expenditure, marginally increased to

0.7 per cent of GDP in 2017 from 0.6 per cent in

2016. Further, higher outlays in respect of interest

payments and disaster relief measures together

with the shortfall in non tax revenue resulted to

increase the budget deficit to 5.5 per cent of GDP

in 2017 from 5.4 per cent in the previous year. In

financing the budget deficit in 2017, the government

relied mainly on foreign sources, although

borrowings from domestic sources increased their

share in financing the deficit as compared to the

previous year. Further, the central government

debt to GDP ratio declined to 77.6 per cent at end

2017 from 78.8 per cent at end 2016 due to the

deceleration in the growth of debt accumulation

and the increase in nominal GDP growth.

The government took measures to increase revenue

mobilisation through hiking tax rates, broadening

the tax base, rationalising tax exemptions and

concessions, and strengthening tax administration

during the year. The new Inland Revenue Act, No.

24 of 2017 was enacted with the expectation of

simplifying and rationalising the existing income

tax structure, broadening the income tax base by

removing tax exemptions and strengthening tax

administration with a view to enhancing revenue

mobilisation from direct taxes. The new Act came

into effect from 01 April 2018. Further, amendments

were made to the Economic Service Charge (ESC)

with effect from 01 April 2017 to expand the tax

base by reducing the threshold for liable turnover

to Rs. 12.5 million per quarter from Rs. 50.0 million

per quarter and imposing ESC on the importation of

motor vehicles. During the year, excise duty rates on

liquor were revised upwards while excise duty was

introduced on raw materials used for the production

of ethanol in order to reduce leakages in the revenue

collection. Further, several exemptions granted under

the Nation Building Tax (NBT) were removed in

2017. In addition to these tax reforms, the automation

process of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD)

through the Revenue Administration Management

Information System (RAMIS) continued in 2017.

Further, a tax expenditure statement outlining the

cost of tax exemptions, tax holidays and other

incentives granted by the government with regard to

key taxes was submitted to the Parliament for the first

time through the 2017 Budget. The inclusion of a tax

expenditure statement to the Budget is expected to

improve fiscal transparency.

On the expenditure front, several measures

were introduced during the year to rationalise

government expenditure while strengthening

the monitoring process of government spending.

Accordingly, as announced in the Budget 2017,

quarterly expenditure and income outcome

reports were presented to the Parliament with a

view to strengthening the Parliamentary control

over public finances. Further, a quarterly budget

estimate for 2018 was provided in the Budget

2018 to strengthen the monitoring process of

the Budget. The performance of major capital

projects of selected ministries was monitored

by the Budget Review and Implementation

Committee (BRIC) established under the

Ministry of Finance and Mass Media (MOF) and

monthly cash releases were made based on the

performance. In order to ensure efficient and

effective spending of budgetary allocations, the

2018 Budget was formulated on a Performance

Based Budgeting (PBB) approach, which is the

practice of developing budgets based on the

relationship between programme funding levels

and expected results from that programme.

Further, automation of key Treasury operations

through the Integrated Treasury Management

Information System (ITMIS) at the MOF also

continued during the year. Meanwhile, the

National Agency for Public Private Partnerships

(NAPPP) was established, in 2017, to collaborate

with the private sector on investment. The NAPPP

is expected to assist in addressing the challenge

of implementing capital projects in a context of

limited fiscal space. Further, the Welfare Benefits

Board (WBB), which was established to provide

the necessary legal framework for all welfare

relief benefits and set out a transparent selection

process, took preliminary steps to establish an

integrated system for all welfare programmes of

the government as a one stop shop for welfare

management. Four major welfare programmes

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

are to be included in this system at the initial

stage. During 2017, Statements of Corporate

Intent (SCIs) were signed with five major SOBEs

to improve the accountability, transparency

and the performance of these SOBEs. These

initiatives are expected to strengthen their

financial positions while enhancing the viability

of their operations. In addition, non commercial

obligations of SOBEs, which is defined as the

provision of goods and services to the consumer

at a price below cost, were presented as a

statement to the Parliament for the first time

with the Budget 2018. This statement included

the non commercial obligations of the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB) for 2017 and 2018.

During 2017, the government earmarked several

non strategic public assets for divestiture with

the aim of utilising proceeds collected through

such divestments to meet future debt service

obligations. Accordingly, a concession agreement

was signed with a foreign investor during the

year to operate the Hambantota Port as a Public

Private Partnership (PPP) and proceeds were to

be used for debt service payments.

As per the Medium Term Macro Fiscal

Framework, the budget deficit is estimated to

reduce to 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2020 and maintain

at the same level while central government debt is

expected to decline to 69 per cent of GDP by 2022.

However, achieving the set fiscal targets over the

medium term remains challenging and requires

a strong commitment from the government.

Especially, the revenue to GDP ratio in Sri Lanka

remains notably below the average revenue

collection of peer economies. This low revenue

collection limits the fiscal space thus requiring debt

financing not only for public investment but also for

a part of recurrent expenditure. Accordingly, the

ratio of government revenue to GDP is expected

to increase to around 17 per cent in the medium

term while maintaining government expenditure at

around 20-21 per cent of GDP. This would enable

public investment to be maintained at the current

level of around 5 per cent of GDP over the medium

term. In line with these expected developments,

the primary balance is expected to improve

further, showing the government’s commitment

in maintaining non interest expenditure within the

revenue collection. Further, the current account is

also expected to record a surplus starting from 2018

enabling the government to discontinue the practice

of borrowing for its day to day operations and to

contribute to the public investment programme

from the revenue collection. Going forward, it is vital

to implement structural reforms which are already

earmarked in the government’s policy document

titled “Vision 2025” as well as in the Budget 2018,

without further delays in order to reap the maximum

benefits from the outlined reforms and to achieve

the envisaged fiscal targets. Although some

progress was observed in revenue mobilisation in

the recent past, the need to increase the revenue

collection remains an unavoidable commitment for

the government in order to reduce the budget deficit

over the medium term. In this context, further to the

tax expenditure analysis, which includes the cost of

tax exemptions, a medium term plan for drafting a

tax expenditure rationalisation statement is also a

necessity for increasing tax revenue. Further, initial

steps were taken to implement a Value Added

Tax (VAT) compliance strategy for taxpayers that

includes a time bound plan to implement risk based

audits, which would also support strengthening tax

administration. In addition, attention should be given

to amend the Fiscal Management (Responsibility)

Act, No. 3 of 2003 to incorporate binding fiscal rules,

clearly defined escape clauses and correction

mechanisms in case of a breach of fiscal targets,

in order to improve fiscal discipline (See Box

Article 06: Fiscal Rules). Further, foreign debt

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

190

6

service obligations falling due during 2019-2023

have become a serious challenge drawing urgent

policy attention of the government. Accordingly,

the Active Liability Management Act, No. 8 of 2018

(ALMA) was enacted in March 2018. The objective

of ALMA is to manage public debt to ensure

financing needs and payment obligations of the

government are met at the lowest possible cost over

the medium to long term consistent with a prudent

degree of risk. ALMA will also allow borrowing in

advance for future debt service requirements.

Further, a Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) for

2019-2023 is to be developed by the MOF and the

Central Bank for better management of government

debt. Besides these initiatives, the introduction of

automatic pricing mechanisms for fuel and electricity

will also improve the financial viability of CPC and

CEB, respectively, thus reducing the government’s

burden arising from the operations of such SOBEs.

Meanwhile, interest payments on outstanding

government debt have become a serious challenge

during the recent past, mainly due to heavy foreign

commercial borrowings at higher interest rates.

Expenditure on interest payments continued

to be the single largest recurrent expenditure

item in fiscal operations in 2017 amounting to

40.2 per cent of the government revenue collection.

Heavy reliance on foreign commercial borrowings,

exposes the country to higher foreign exchange

risk and external shocks, thereby exerting pressure

on the balance of payments of the country as well.

6.2 Fiscal Policy Direction and Measures

The government undertook numerous

measures in 2017 to continue with the revenue

based fiscal consolidation process, aiming to

reduce the budget deficit and the outstanding

debt in the medium term. Accordingly, in order

to achieve the envisaged medium term targets,

several policy measures were introduced, in 2017,

to enhance the revenue collection, prioritise and

rationalise government expenditure, strengthen

the financial performance of major SOBEs and

improve debt management strategies.

On the revenue front, the new Inland Revenue

Act, No. 24 of 2017, which was enacted in

October 2017, was implemented with effect

from 01 April 2018. The new Act was drafted

with the expectation of simplifying and rationalising

the existing income tax structure, broadening the

income tax base by removing tax exemptions and

strengthening tax administration with a view to

enhancing revenue mobilisation from direct taxes.

The new Act has brought about significant changes

to the structure of income taxes. For employment

income, the tax free threshold was increased to

Rs. 1.2 million from Rs. 750,000 although the tax free

threshold for personal income tax was maintained

at the previous level of Rs. 500,000. Further, tax

slabs for personal income tax, including employment

income, were widened from Rs. 500,000 to

Rs. 600,000 brackets and the highest marginal

tax rate increased to 24 per cent from 16 per cent.

Corporate income taxes were also streamlined

with the introduction of a three tier tax structure.

Accordingly, a lower income tax rate of 14 per cent

Introduction

Fiscal discipline1 is essential for the achievement of the overall macroeconomic stability of a country. It provides the necessary flexibility for effective and independent monetary policy implementation. Lack of fiscal discipline, which leads to fiscal dominance in an economy, weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy in achieving price stability. Fiscal discipline needs to be achieved by meeting annual or medium term targets relating to fiscal outcomes. Meeting targeted fiscal outcomes may not be feasible unless fiscal authorities follow certain specific rules. Long term constraints that are imposed on fiscal policy are defined as fiscal rules. Often, this constraint comprises the imposition of numerical targets for fiscal outcomes, such as expenditure, revenue, government budget deficits or debt. International experience shows that the adoption of fiscal rules contributes towards maintaining fiscal discipline, preventing an economy from sliding into circumstances that lead to overall macroeconomic instability. Therefore, fiscal rules are necessary for ensuring that a country's budgetary operations are aimed at long term fiscal sustainability and solvency.

Types of Fiscal Rules

There are four key types of fiscal rules, namely debt rule, budget balance rule, expenditure rule and revenue rule. Each rule has unique characteristics depending on its objectives, operational guidance, transparency and the budgetary aggregate it seeks to constrain. The debt rule (DR) sets an explicit limit or target for public debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), while the budget balance rule (BBR) attempts to impose a rule on government expenditure so that spending cannot exceed revenue. Some countries use structural budget balance rules2 in order to account for business cycles. Moreover, expenditure rules (ER) set limits on current and total spending. Revenue rules (RR), which set ceilings or floor limits on government revenue, aim at boosting the revenue collection and preventing an excessive tax burden on the public.

International Experience

Rules and limits, which govern fiscal policy largely tend to differ across countries. For example, Indonesia and Poland have debt ceilings of 60 per cent of GDP while in Malaysia and New Zealand debt ceilings are 55 per cent of GDP. The main objective of the debt ceiling in all these countries is to reduce or maintain the outstanding stock of debt at prudent levels. Time

BOX 06Fiscal Rules

frames associated with these targets also tend to vary although some countries define targets for a period of several years, while others revise their targets annually. In comparison to the debt ceiling, the RR and the ER are not widely used. In Germany, however, expenditure cannot grow faster than revenue on average, while in Brazil expenditure is limited to 50 per cent of the net current revenue for the federal government and 60 per cent for states and municipalities. Only a few countries use the RR since it is directly linked to the income of people. Kenya maintains revenue at 21-22 per cent of GDP.

Adoption of fiscal rules by countries has increased over the last three decades according to the IMF. By 1990, only five countries, namely Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Luxembourg and the United States had adopted fiscal rules. Since then, the adoption of fiscal rules has been widespread and 92 countries had adopted fiscal rules by 2015 (Figure B 6.1). Of these 92 countries, 73 countries have used more than one type of fiscal rule. For example, fiscal toolkits of Australia, France, Lithuania and the Netherlands comprise a combination of the four types of fiscal rules. Among the four key fiscal rules, the BBRs are the most popular, while RRs tend to be the least popular. It is observed that low-income countries resort to the use of DRs, while advanced economies focus more on BBRs.

International experience suggests that the imposition of penalties or statutory actions are important for making fiscal rules binding. For example, in Denmark, all net extra tax revenues are confiscated through a reduction in individual and general block grants in a case of violation of fiscal rules. In Poland, if outstanding stock of debt exceeds 55 per cent of GDP, the Council of Ministers must present a fiscal consolidation plan to the Parliament to lower the debt stock. If the level

Structural balances are an extension of cyclically adjusted balances, correcting for a broader range of factors such as asset and commodity prices and output composition effects. Cyclically adjusted balance can be obtained from subtracting cyclically adjusted expenditure from cyclically adjusted overall revenue (Fabian et al., 2011).

of public debt reaches 60 per cent of GDP, no new state guarantees may be issued and the council of Ministers must submit a fiscal consolidation plan to the Parliament, while the sub-national governments must pass balanced budgets. In four provinces in Canada, ministries and members of the executive council are subject to significant cuts in wages in case of a failure in achieving fiscal targets. In Ireland, provisions are laid down to remove defaulting authorities from office. In Italy, breaking of fiscal rules can lead to limitations being imposed on the purchase of goods and services by the rule breaking authorities with staff hiring freezes implemented alongside a barring of all new debt. In Spain, non-compliant authorities are required to submit a plan for correcting any fiscal deficit.

Although the proper implementation of fiscal rules would ensure that governments do not deviate from the outlined targets, exceptional circumstances may arise wherein it may be impossible to conform to such targets. In this context, suitable yet stringent ‘escape clauses’, which provide some leeway for fiscal authorities are necessary. While a rule that can be easily avoided is rather useless, excessively strict rules that do not provide sufficient flexibility may discourage compliance. Escape clauses are typically applicable to natural disasters and economic recessions. However, international experience shows that other circumstances are also cited in escape clauses. For example, Romania has incorporated change in government, change in budget coverage, and events that occur outside government control as escape clauses.3 Further, political business cycles are also a matter of concern when assessing compliance with fiscal rules. Cristian and Olcer (2013), in their study of 68 low income countries (including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal and Nigeria) found that government consumption increases and leads to

higher fiscal deficits during election years in low income countries. Empirical findings also show that during the two years following elections, fiscal adjustment takes place through increases in revenue via trade taxes and reductions in government investment. However, the size of the political budget cycle is much smaller in countries, that follow fiscal rules or are engaged with the IMF through fund facility programmes that span over the election period.

While binding fiscal rules and escape clauses are important for the proper implementation of fiscal rules, a monitoring mechanism is also required for successful implementation of fiscal rules. Countries adopting fiscal rules have established enforcement mechanisms or a separate monitoring body to observe compliance with fiscal rules. The body charged with monitoring fiscal developments also makes recommendations in cases of non-compliance.

Sri Lankan Experience

During the last 30 years, Sri Lanka has experienced large budget deficits with high debt levels. On average, budget deficits have been around 7.5 per cent of GDP and debt level at 90 per cent of GDP during the period. Revenue mobilisation in Sri Lanka, has been well below the total expenditure incurred by the government and insufficient to cover even recurrent expenses. This generated persistently high budget deficits over the years, forcing the government to rely on debt financing even to support government recurrent expenditure, which in turn contributed to the accumulation of the government debt stock. In 2001, the central government debt to GDP ratio in Sri Lanka reached 103 per cent. High budget deficits and high debt levels created strong spillover effects to the other sectors of the economy, threatening the macroeconomic stability of the country. Recognising the economic repercussions of significant fiscal outlays, which increased fiscal dominance in the economy, 3. IMF staff assessment

successive governments made several attempts to implement fiscal rules on debt and the budget deficit in Sri Lanka aiming at achieving fiscal discipline. The Enactment of Fiscal Management (Responsibility)

Act, No.3 of 2003 (FMRA) was such an attempt taken by the government to improve the fiscal discipline in the country. The debt to GDP ratio, then, declined gradually to 68.7 per cent in 2012, partly due to high economic

was introduced to majority of sectors including

exporters, agriculture businesses, educational

services and promotion of tourism. Further, a

standard rate of 28 per cent was introduced for

banking, finance, insurance industry and trading

activities while a higher rate of 40 per cent was

introduced for liquor, tobacco, and betting and

gaming industries. In addition, a Capital Gains Tax

(CGT) was introduced at a rate of 10 per cent upon

gains on the realisation of capital assets. Further, the

withholding tax rate on interest income arising from

deposits maintained by resident individuals was

increased to 5 per cent from 2.5 per cent,1 while a

withholding tax was introduced for service fees and

contract payments with a view to broadening the

tax base. Meanwhile, the 10 per cent withholding

tax, which was applicable on interest income on

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, was removed

in the new Act. However, the interest income from

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds are subject to

tax at the income tax rates applicable to the tax

payer. A tax manual is being drafted and training

growth, although the country continuously and extensively deviated from the targeted fiscal path. The debt to GDP ratio reached 78.8 per cent of GDP in 2016, reflecting debt accumulation following high financing requirements generated through expanded budget deficits and slowdown in economic growth. In comparison to rating peers, Sri Lanka's budget deficit and stock of debt have remained at significantly high levels.

The FMRA outlined its main targets to be achieved by 2006, as a budget deficit of 5.0 per cent of GDP, which was to be maintained thereafter, and debt to GDP ratio of 85.0 per cent. It also outlined that the debt to GDP ratio to be curtailed further to 60 per cent by 2013. However, as fiscal deviations were quite significant, particularly at the height of the internal conflict, the FMRA was amended in 2013. Debt to GDP ratio was to be reduced to 80 per cent by 2013 and to 60 per cent by 2020. The initial target for government guaranteed debt to GDP ratio outlined in 2003 was of 4.5 per cent, for every year. It was later revised upwards to 7.0 per cent in 2013, followed by a further upward revision to 10 per cent in the 2016 amendment. Despite this legislative setting of clear targets for fiscal aggregates, there are no formal enforcement procedures outlined in the FMRA. Hence, in the recent past, Sri Lanka’s fiscal performance has consistently deviated from the prescribed fiscal rules as well as the envisaged fiscal consolidation path (Chart B 6.2).

Chart B 6.3 shows movements in both the primary balance and the overall balance for the period 1999 to 2017, during which time several elections were held. Although, it may be difficult to identify a significant relationship between elections and budget balances

during the period prior to 2009, as a result of the internal conflict that prevailed, the fact that the election cycles affect fiscal performance in Sri Lanka cannot be ruled out.

Way Forward

Even though Sri Lanka has fiscal rules outlined in the FMRA, the country has experienced frequent deviations from set rules mainly due to two reasons; non availability of legally binding constraints, and a lack of a proper enforcement mechanism. Such frequent deviations have not only eroded fiscal discipline but also created spillover effects on the entire macroeconomy. Therefore, it is essential to revise the existing FMRA to include binding fiscal rules with legal enforcement, facilitating the imposition of sanctions in case of deviations. Further, it may be prudent to include escape clauses for events, such as disasters and severe recessions, in order to enable the authorities to provide a safety net mechanism for affected persons in such circumstances. Furthermore, political commitment towards fiscal rules and public support is critical in achieving the stipulated targets and maintaining fiscal discipline, especially for a country like Sri Lanka, where the mindset of the public is still focused on an array of fiscal concessions. Hence, educating the public about the consequences of unsustainable fiscal policies remains paramount in building up public support.

Acts in November 2016. Raising the VAT rate to

15 per cent from 11 per cent, lowering the registration

threshold of VAT to Rs. 3.0 million per quarter from

Rs. 3.75 million per quarter and the imposition of

VAT on liquor, cigarettes, coal, perfumes, electrical

and electronic goods, and telecommunication

equipment were the major changes made to the

VAT Act in 2016. In addition, changes to NBT

included reduction in the registration threshold

for NBT to Rs. 3.0 million per quarter from

Rs. 3.75 million per quarter and removal of NBT

exemptions on telecommunication, supply of

electricity and lubricants. Further, as proposed

in the Budget 2017, NBT exemptions on goods

required for services of international transportation,

supply of residential apartments and the supply of

goods and services by any Co-operative Society or

Lak Sathosa Limited were removed with effect from

01 August 2017.

In keeping with the government policy on

trade liberalisation, measures were taken to

phase out para tariffs in 2017. The government

took a policy decision to abolish para tariffs on

tariff lines that do not carry any customs duties,

during the next three-year period in line with World

Trade Organization (WTO) commitments. At the

end of 2017, over 1,200 para tariffs in the form of

Cess Levy and Ports and Airports Development

Levy (PAL) were removed in addition to the

removal of para tariffs of Cess Levy applicable to

over 100 imported items in the previous year. In

addition, measures were also taken to revise and

adopt the 2017 Version of the Harmonized System

of Commodity Classification and Coding System

(HS Codes) of the World Customs Organization

(WCO) to Customs tariff lines.

Customs duty and customs duty waivers

were revised during the year to reduce the

pressure on domestic market prices of several

essential items as a result of developments

in the international market. Accordingly,

customs duty waivers were granted on the

importation of diesel and petrol in February 2017 at

Rs. 3 per litre and Rs. 10 per litre, respectively.

Further, during the year customs duty waivers

were revised several times in line with changes

in international oil prices. Thus, the end of the

year customs duty waiver on the importation

of diesel and petrol stood at Rs. 11 per litre and

Rs. 23 per litre, respectively. Accordingly, at

the end of 2017, custom duties applicable on

the importation of diesel and petrol were at

Rs. 4 per litre and Rs. 12 per litre, respectively. In

addition, in July 2017, the customs duty waiver on

the importation of milk powder was increased to

Rs. 223 per kg reducing the applicable custom duty

to Rs. 2 per kg.

Measures were taken to increase the revenue

collection from excise duties in 2017 while

minimising leakages in the revenue collection.

Accordingly, excise duty rates on liquor were

revised upwards during the year while simplifying

the process of issuing licenses on the importation

of foreign liquor. An excise duty was imposed on

the importation of non potable alcohol at a rate of

Rs. 15 per litre to provide further assistance to local

manufacturers. Meanwhile, an excise duty was

imposed on raw materials used for the production of

ethanol in order to monitor the production of liquor

and assist in curtailing illegal liquor production.

Meanwhile, the excise duty on motor vehicles used for

the transportation of goods was revised downwards

to Rs. 700,000 per unit from Rs. 1,000,000 per unit.

The Special Commodity Levy (SCL) on the

importation of several food items was introduced

and SCL for some items was revised a number of

times during 2017 to provide necessary protection

for domestic agricultural producers during

harvesting seasons and to reduce volatility in

prices in the domestic market. Accordingly, SCL of

Rs. 15 per kg was introduced in place of customs duty

on imported raw rice (kekulu), nadu rice and samba

rice with effect from 07 January 2017. However, this

SCL was reduced to Rs. 5 per kg with effect from

28 January 2017, and further to 25 cents per kg with

effect from 27 July 2017 due to supply shortages that

prevailed in the domestic market resulting from the

drought conditions experienced in several districts

of the country. In addition, SCL on the importation

of vegetable oil was revised downwards three times

during the year in January, February and November

2017, while it was revised upwards in December

2017. Further, SCL applicable on 12 items, including

dried fish, yoghurt, butter, garlic, oranges, apples,

salt and kurakkan flour was extended with effect from

02 April 2017. Meanwhile, SCL on fish, green gram,

mangosteen, dried oranges, kiwifruit, pear, cherries,

plums and sloes was extended twice for a period

of six months with effect from 08 May 2017 and 08

November 2017, respectively. During the second

half of 2017, SCL on sugar was increased twice by

Rs. 10 per kg and Rs. 8 per kg. Accordingly, SCL

applicable on brown sugar and white sugar was

Rs. 33 per kg and Rs. 31 per kg, respectively, at the

end of the year. In addition, as a relief measure to

domestic consumers, the government announced

a reduction of SCL applicable on several essential

items including, sprats, potatoes, dried fish, b’onion

and dhal with effect from 09 November 2017.

Initiatives were taken in 2017 to improve tax

administration in order to strengthen revenue

collecting agencies for an efficient collection

of revenue. Registered taxpayers were able to

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

197

make tax payments with effect from March 2017

through banks under the RAMIS System, which is

being set up at the IRD. Meanwhile, VAT payments

on financial services through RAMIS commenced

in August 2017. In addition, online submission of

returns as well as schedules of individual income

tax and partnership income tax also commenced in

November 2017. Meanwhile, initial steps were taken

by the Sri Lanka Customs to establish a National

Single Window (NSW) system linking all border

agencies that perform various regulatory functions

in the import and export of goods with a view to

facilitating importers and exporters. Further, ITMIS

is being introduced to modernise public financial

management through the automation of key

Treasury operations. During 2017, the development

and testing of ITMIS modules such as Internal

Audit Management, Cadre Management and

Court-case Management modules were completed.

In addition, the Budget Planning module was

commissioned for all spending agencies for the

submission of budget estimates for 2018 to the

National Budget Department on a pilot basis.

A pilot operation of ITMIS core modules was

conducted in the MOF and the Ministry of Higher

Education and Highways from November to

December 2017. Meanwhile, the VAT compliance

strategy is expected to be implemented in 2018 for

large businesses on a pilot basis, which includes a

time-bound plan to implement risk-based audits and

key performance indicators. The VAT compliance

strategy will be extended to small and medium

taxpayers as well in the near term.

On the expenditure front, the government’s

effort in rationalising expenditure while

strengthening the monitoring process continued

in 2017. Accordingly, quarterly expenditure and

income outcome reports for the first three

quarters of 2017 were presented to the

Parliament as announced in the Budget 2017

aimed at strengthening the Parliamentary control

over public finances. As per these reports, both

revenue and expenditure outcomes remained

below the targeted levels for the first three quarters

of 2017. Further, under the State Accounts

Circular No. 263/2017, all spending agencies

were instructed to prepare their annual budgets

on a quarterly basis for 2018 in order to ensure

the systematic utilisation of annual budgetary

provisions. Under the National Budget Circular

No. 05/2016, instructions were given to all

spending agencies to set quarterly expenditure

ceilings for all expenditure heads in 2017. Under

the National Budget Circular No. 01/2017, a

decision was taken to continue the monitoring

process of the utilisation of budgetary provisions

allocated to spending agencies with the objective

of achieving efficiency in resource allocation. The

BRIC established under the MOF monitored the

performance of major capital projects of fourteen

selected ministries. Subsequently, monthly cash

releases were made based on their performance

in order to rationalise government expenditure.

Following the guidelines in the National Budget

Circular No. 2/2017, the Budget 2018 was

formulated under the PBB approach, in order

to ensure the efficient and effective spending

of every budgetary allocation. This was done

based on the experience of implementing the

zero based budgeting approach in the preceding

years. Moreover, Cabinet approval was granted

to utilise the existing budgetary provisions in

2017 for the rehabilitation and reconstruction

of properties damaged as a result of adverse

weather conditions in order to minimise the

impact of disaster related expenditure on the

central government budget amidst prevailing

fiscal constraints. Such expenditure switching

served to contain the impact of disaster related

expenses on the overall budget deficit.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

The automation process of the Department

of Pensions was further strengthened in 2017

to improve service delivery through efficiency

enhancing measures. Under the Public

Administration Circular No. 26/2017, actions were

taken to introduce an online registration process

for pensioners who were registered for Widows’/

Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme before

12 March 2015. Facilities were also provided

to officers who have already been registered in

the online system to update their information.

Furthermore, actions were taken to introduce a

fully automated online registration process for the

Public Services Provident Fund while providing

facilities to send monthly contribution details online.

Public officers, who were recruited after 01 January

2016, were granted the entitlement for Widows’/

Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme under

the Public Administration Circular No. 21/2017.

Accordingly, the Pension Circular No. 06/2017 was

issued to recover contributions to the Widows’/

Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme from

relevant officers with effect from 01 January 2016.

The government maintained its public

investment programme during the year with

the continuation of several major infrastructure

projects while taking necessary steps to

promote PPPs due to the limited fiscal space

available for public investment. On the road

development front, the government invested

on road construction, rehabilitation and land

acquisition during the year. Further, the multi

purpose development project in Moragahakanda

was vested to the public, in January 2018, in order

to facilitate agricultural activities in the Northern,

Central and Eastern Provinces. In addition,

resources were made available for the rehabilitation

of infrastructure damaged due to adverse weather

conditions during the year. Meanwhile, with a

view to promoting PPPs as a national strategy in

addressing the infrastructure requirements in the

country amidst the limited fiscal space available

for public investment, the NAPPP was established

in 2017. The main objective of establishing the

NAPPP was to create a central agency with

adequate legal, administrative and financial

authority to identify suitable projects that can be

executed as PPPs, prepare required guidelines

and invite bids and select investors, in consultation

with relevant line ministries. During the year, the

NAPPP shortlisted projects that were identified

as high priority projects to execute as PPPs in

consultation with the World Bank.

The government continued to channel

resources to improve the welfare of needy

groups while taking measures to rationalise

several subsidy programmes. Accordingly,

programmes such as the nutritional food package

for expectant mothers, the Thriposha programme

and school nutrition programmes were continued,

in 2017, aimed at improving maternal and child

nutrition. Further, actions were taken to increase

the allowance granted to Chronic Kidney Disease

of unknown aetiology (CKDu) patients to Rs. 5,000

from Rs. 3,000 per month. Moreover, approval

was granted to provide a sum of Rs. 5,000 per

month, including all monthly allowances that are

already being paid to elders over 100 years of age

who fall within the low income category with effect

from 01 December 2017. In conducting welfare

programmes of the Samurdhi Department, priority

was given to improve the living standard of

vulnerable persons in the poorest regions of the

Northern and Eastern provinces. Further, the WBB,

which was established in 2016, has taken measures

to setup an integrated Social Registry Information

System (SRIS)2 for all welfare programmes of

the government. Initially, information related to

four welfare programmes; Samurdhi programme,

2 SRIS is an electronic database which stores information related to welfare programmes.

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

199

financial support for elderly over 70 years of age,

support for low income disabled persons and

financial support for kidney patients will be included

in the SRIS. Meanwhile, a decision was taken by the

Cabinet of Ministers, in March 2018, to terminate

the cash grant policy of the fertiliser subsidy

programme while approving to provide fertiliser to

farmers in order to avoid the issues which arose

in implementing the cash grant policy. Accordingly,

an approved amount of fertiliser will be provided

for farmers at a concessionary price of Rs. 500 per

50 kg bag for paddy and Rs. 1,500 per 50 kg bag

for other crops (potatoes, onions, capsicum, corn

and soya) with effect from the Yala season in 2018.

The government took several policy

measures to improve the performance of

SOBEs in order to reduce the burden on the

central government budget. Accordingly, SCIs

were signed in March 2017 with selected five main

SOBEs, namely CEB, CPC, National Water Supply

and Drainage Board (NWS&DB), Airport and

Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. and Sri Lanka

Ports Authority (SLPA) in order to improve financial

and non financial performance and corporate

governance practices while ensuring the usage

of international best practices in their operations.

Further, it is expected that SCIs will be signed

with another ten SOBEs3 by early 2018 to improve

their efficiency. The SCI concept is expected to be

extended to other enterprises during the year 2018.

In order to improve the financial viability of SriLankan

Airlines (SLA), the government, in 2017, called for a

Request for Proposal (RFP) to obtain consultancy

services for the restructuring process. Accordingly,

lead consultants were appointed to conduct an

independent assessment of SLA’s current business

model and to provide assistance to identify potential

candidates for the proposed PPP. Meanwhile, the

3 Urban Development Authority (UDA), State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC), Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC), State Timber Corporation, Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), MILCO Ltd., National Livestock Development Board (NLDB), Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB), Lanka Sathosa Ltd. and Lankaputhra Development Bank (LDB)

SLPA entered into a concession agreement with the

China Merchant Port Holding Company, in 2017,

to operate the Hambantota Port as a PPP. In the

energy sector, a cost reflective pricing formula to

adjust domestic retail prices of petrol and diesel in

line with international prices is under consideration

in order to improve the financial viability of the CPC

while ensuring transparency in petroleum pricing.

Since non-commercial obligations are identified as

a part of the government committed expenditure,

non-commercial obligations of CPC and CEB

were presented for the first time in the Budget

2018 to improve fiscal transparency. Accordingly,

Rs. 35.1 billion and Rs. 16.5 billion have been

identified as non-commercial obligations of CEB

for 2017 and 2018, respectively. Since the CPC

was expected to generate profit in 2017 and 2018,

non-commercial obligations are not incorporated

for CPC in the Budget 2018.

Initiatives were taken by the Central Bank

during the year to improve transparency and

efficiency in the government securities market.

The Central Bank mandated primary dealers

(PDs) and licensed banks to use the Bloomberg

electronic bond trading platform for secondary

market transactions in government securities

from April 2017. Further, PDs were also required

to quote and engage in repurchase transactions

(repos) through the trading platform and report

repos of Rs. 100 million or above carried out

over-the-counter with investors through the trading

platform, within 30 minutes of the completion of

each repo transaction. A daily summary of trade

information on repo volumes and yield rates is being

published by the Central Bank for the information of

market participants. These measures are expected

to help improve transparency while facilitating

price discovery, increasing market liquidity and

outreach, thereby reducing the cost of borrowing

in the medium term. A new primary issuance

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

200

6

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) introduced a new primary issuance system for Treasury bonds (T-bonds) with effect from July 27, 2017, replacing the fully auction based issuance system that was in practice since February 2015. The new issuance system has been in response to a strong need for an efficient and transparent issuance system of government securities, in line with international best practices.

The new T-bond issuance system, opened for primary dealers (PDs) and non dealer bidders, as approved by the Monetary Board (presently Employees’ Provident Fund is the only non dealer bidder eligible to take part in primary issuances of T-bonds), comprises three phases and includes regular monthly T-bond auctions, with each auction offering two T-bond series of different maturities. For each series being offered, issuance under Phase I involves a multiple price auction system whereas the volume of issuance under phase II/III depends on the outcome of preceding phase/s, as detailed below.

Phase I: The competitive issuance of T-bonds under the multiple price auction system and acceptance of bids up to reaching an acceptable level to the Tender Board in terms of Weighted Average Yield Rate (WAYR) and cut- off rate within the amount offered at the auction.

Phase II: Voluntary volume based bidding for any under allocation at Phase I, where issuances are made at WAYR determined at Phase I. In the event of oversubscription, allocation at this stage takes effect proportionate to the performance of each bidder at Phase I.

Phase III: Mandatory issuance at WAYR (to PDs only) of any further under allocation based on each PD’s performance at Phases I and II. However, execution of Phase III is limited to instances where accepting 60 per cent of the offered amount in minimum takes place at Phase I. Issuance at Phase III to any PD is inversely proportionate to its ratio of success at Phase I and Phase II.

In brief, the new system could be viewed as a hybrid of competitive auction and performance based non-competitive allocation at weighted average yield rates arrived at the Phase I of the auction. Such non-competitive allocations would act as rewards for deserving auction participants for active participation in competitive auctions. Further, such a scheme of

BOX 07Introduction of a New Issuance System for Treasury bonds

performance based allocation is expected to serve as a tool to reduce the risk of collusive behaviour by PDs. The new system encourages PDs to broaden their investor base and improve competitiveness at auctions for business sustainability.

• 1.30 pm-2.30 pm - bidding under Phase II for non-competitive allocation for any balance funding needed

*Allocation under Phase III is subject to acceptance of 60 per cent in minimum of theofferred volume at Phase I.

A noticeable feature of the new issuance system is the limiting of volume acceptable under each T-bond series to the volume offered under such series by the CBSL in its auction announcement, and thereby improving the transparency of the issuance process and building confidence among bidders over the issuance process.

Other salient features of the new bond issuance system include the following:

(i) Ensuring coupon interest rates of new T-bonds to be offered to commensurate with prevailing market interest rates and thereby not accommodating the issuances of deep discounted T-bonds;

(ii) Fixing the maturity date of new bond issuances to 15th of the calendar month, that would eventually coincide with new issuances upon such maturities, thereby, ensuring more predictability;

(iii) Setting the minimum bidding by each PD to the per PD average of the volume tendered; and

(iv) Introducing quarterly minimum performance criteria for PDs, requiring each PD to maintain a minimum success ratio of 50 per cent of the average volume issued to PDs under Phase I within the corresponding quarter.

The new primary issuance system is expected to increase competitiveness among bidders and cost efficiency to the issuer, while enhancing transparency of the issuance process. In this respect, it is important that the amounts raised through T-bond primary auctions are determined taking into consideration the resources available in the market. Communication

of the issuance volumes and corresponding tenors in advance, by way of an auction calendar, which is another improvement in the annual T-bond issuance process, would support the market participants to better prepare themselves and thereby, contribute positively towards the success of the new system, in terms of cost effectiveness and participation.

system for Treasury bonds was introduced, in July

2017, replacing the fully auction based issuance

system that had been in practice from February

2015. Regular monthly Treasury bond auctions

are carried out through this new system. Under the

new system there are three standard phases for

each issuance of Treasury bonds. Phase I explores

the issuance of the entire announced volume in a

competitive multiple price auction system through

reasonable market bids and Phase II opens for

voluntary, volume based bidding while Phase III

issues any under allocation during Phases I and II

on a mandatory basis to PDs (See Box Article 07:

Introduction of a New Issuance System for Treasury

Bonds). A performance review mechanism has also

been introduced to assess the effective participation

of PDs with the implementation of the new primary

issuance system for Treasury bonds. Further, in

order to improve the investment planning of PDs

and investors at large, a quarterly Treasury

bond auction calendar is published in advance.

Accordingly, the newly introduced system is

expected to further enhance the efficiency

and transparency of domestic borrowings of

the government. Transparency has also been

enhanced through regular pre-bid briefings.

Moreover, several other measures are in the

pipeline to further improve the government

securities market. Accordingly, the Central

Bank continues the process of establishing an

Electronic Trading Platform (ETP) and a Central

Counter Party Clearing House (CCP) while taking

measures to further improve the existing payment

and settlement systems infrastructure in order to

deepen and broaden the secondary market for

government securities. Additionally, in line with the

new Treasury bond primary issuance system, the

possibility of introducing a new primary issuance

system for Treasury bills is being explored.

Management of public debt has been

further strengthened with the enactment of the

Active Liability Management Act. The ALMA,

which provides legal provisions to conduct liability

management activities, was enacted in March

2018. A country’s ability to effectively institutionalise

a liability management framework is regarded by

the international rating agencies and the investor

community as credit positive. The execution of

liability management exercises, such as buying

back of existing debt and switching existing debt

with new debt and prefunding arrangements, are

expected to improve the underlying risk profile

of both domestic and foreign debt stocks of

the government. Amongst the benefits of such

an exercise, minimisation of rollover risk of the

underlying debt stock by smoothening the maturity

profile is foremost. Additionally, a buffer fund will

be established to further minimise the rollover risk

of the debt stock.

The government successfully issued the

11th and 12th International Sovereign Bonds

(ISBs) in May 2017 and April 2018, respectively,

reflecting the continued confidence of

investors. Accordingly, the government was able

to raise US dollars 1.5 billion in May 2017 with a

10-year maturity at a yield of 6.20 per cent per

annum. Further, the 12th ISB was issued in April

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

202

6

2018, which was the largest offshore bond offering

ever by Sri Lanka, to raise US dollars 2.5 billion.

Accordingly, US dollars 1.25 billion each worth of

ISBs was issued with a 5-year maturity at a yield

of 5.75 per cent and a 10 year maturity at a yield

of 6.75 per cent. In addition, a Foreign Currency

Term Financing Facility (FCTFF) of US dollars

1.0 billion was obtained during the year and

funds were received in two tranches; US dollars

450 million in May 2017 and US dollars 550 million

in August 2017.

The government successfully met the key

QPC of the IMF-EFF programme relating to

fiscal operations during 2017. The three-year

IMF-EFF programme was obtained in June 2016

with the aim of strengthening the country’s external

sector while supporting the government’s economic

reform agenda. The programme includes a reform

agenda aimed at rebuilding foreign exchange

reserves and reducing the fiscal deficit to contain

the debt accumulation while restoring overall

macroeconomic stability. The QPC selected

in relation to government’s fiscal operations

is the primary balance. The realised primary

balance for the period January-June 2017 and

January-December 2017 were surpluses of

Rs. 16.1 billion and Rs. 2.1 billion, respectively.

Accordingly, the government successfully met the

QPC for the primary balance in 2017.

The sovereign credit rating outlook for

Sri Lanka was upgraded by two international

rating agencies in 2017. Fitch upgraded the rating

outlook to “stable” from “negative” and affirmed

Sri Lanka’s long-term foreign and local currency

issuer default ratings at “B+” on 09 February 2017.

In their assessment, Fitch highlighted improving

fiscal finances, improved policy coherence and

credibility and stable growth in Sri Lanka. Further,

Standard and Poor’s (S&P) upgraded its outlook

to “stable” from “negative” and affirmed its B+ long

term rating on 20 November 2017 highlighting

the strengthening of Sri Lanka’s institutions and

governance practices in a sustainable manner.

Earlier, on 07 March 2017, S&P affirmed its “B+”

long-term rating and “B” short-term sovereign

credit rating, highlighting improvements in the

fiscal performance. However, the outlook was

maintained at “negative”, citing weak external

sector performance and the rising exchange rate

pressure on public debt. Moody’s Investor Services

also affirmed Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating at “B1”

with a “negative” outlook on 13 July 2017. Again,

on 12 December 2017, Moody’s Investor Services

affirmed the sovereign rating at “B1” with a

“negative” outlook. Recently, on 07 February 2018,

Fitch affirmed Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating at “B+”

with a “stable” outlook highlighting improved fiscal

consolidation and maintenance of a disciplined

monetary stance.

Amidst the measures taken towards

revenue based fiscal consolidation, fiscal

sector performance in 2017 deviated from

the envisaged targets. Avoiding deviations from

fiscal targets and achieving fiscal discipline

are imperative to make the fiscal consolidation

programme a success. Maintaining fiscal discipline

by adhering to fiscal rules is important to achieve

overall macroeconomic stability. Revenue shortfall,

expenditure overruns, high budget deficits and

increase in government debt will lead to a fall in

expenditure on public investment while making

fiscal consolidation a difficult task. Given the current

debt dynamics, fiscal slippage can lead to a serious

economic crisis. Though the government has taken

several rigorous measures towards increasing

revenue mobilisation, the continuation of such

efforts is imperative to achieve revenue targets.

transparency and accountability in public financial

management and proper targeting of subsidies

would improve the quality of public expenditure

by aligning its composition with national priorities

within the medium term budgetary framework.

Interest payments continued to be the single largest

item in recurrent expenditure, while the salary bill

as a percentage of GDP is also high in comparison

to peer countries as the size of government sector

employment has been increased by 33.7 per cent

to 1.1 million during the period 2006-2015. During

this period, the public sector was the main source

of employment generation. Further, rapid changes

in the demographic profile, coupled with the

substantial increase in the size of the public sector,

has resulted in an increase in pension payments,

which currently accounts for a significant share of

recurrent expenditure (9.4 per cent). As ageing is

expected to remain a key concern in the future, it

is essential to take necessary steps to ensure the

sustainability of the public sector pension scheme

which is currently unfunded. In this context,

expediting the implementation of the contributory

pension scheme, as proposed in Budget 2017, is

important while raising the retirement age for the

public sector employees could also be another

option. Moreover, the high level of transfer payments

and expenditure on welfare payments continue

to weigh down on the government budget. These

developments have limited the fiscal space available

for prioritised expenditures, such as education

and health, creating several challenges to the

socio-economic development of the country.

Excessive and continuous reliance on foreign

borrowings, particularly of a commercial nature,

increases the country’s exposure to foreign exchange

risk and risks associated with increasing international

interest rates. Liability management activities on the

foreign debt portfolio, if prudently managed, would

help smoothen the rollover plan of the government

debt. Fiscal consolidation is invariably politically

challenging, particularly in a country which has been

characterised by populist policies and an entitlement

culture. Hence, developing a political consensus and

raising public awareness are paramount in achieving

targets stipulated in the fiscal consolidation path.

6.3 Government Budgetary Operations

Revenue and Grants

Revenue

The increasing trend in the collection of tax

revenue continued in 2017, although total revenue

as a per cent of GDP declined as a result of lower

revenue from non tax sources. Accordingly, tax

revenue increased to 12.6 per cent of GDP in 2017

from 12.3 per cent in 2016 reflecting the revenue

based fiscal consolidation measures adopted by the

government. The notable increase in the VAT revenue

collection as a result of several amendments made to

the VAT Act, including the rate hike to 15 per cent

during the latter part of 2016, led to the improvement in

tax revenue during 2017. However, total government

revenue declined to 13.8 per cent of GDP in 2017 from

14.2 per cent in 2016 as a result of the deceleration in

non tax revenue to 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2017 from

1.9 per cent in 2016 due to the decline in dividend

transfers from major SOBEs.

Total revenue in nominal terms increased by

8.6 per cent to Rs. 1,831.5 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 1,686.1 billion in 2016. Tax revenue increased

by 14.1 per cent to Rs. 1,670.2 billion from

Rs. 1,463.7 billion in 2016 reflecting a substantial

growth in VAT proceeds followed by the increased

revenue collection from excise duty on petroleum

products, ESC, SCL, PAL and NBT. However, the

revenue collection from import duties, corporate and

non corporate income taxes, withholding tax, excise

duty on liquor and cigarettes, Telecommunication

Levy and the Cess Levy declined during the year.

Revenue from indirect taxes continued to be the

major contributor to government revenue, accounting

for 83.6 per cent of total tax revenue in 2017. The

share of revenue from direct taxes out of total tax

revenue declined to 16.4 per cent during the year

in comparison to 17.7 per cent in the previous year

mainly due to the higher growth recorded in indirect

taxes as a result of the significant increase in the

collection of VAT revenue. Meanwhile, reflecting

the decline in the collection of non tax revenue to

Rs. 161.4 billion in 2017 from Rs. 222.4 billion in 2016,

the share of tax revenue in total revenue substantially

increased to 91.2 per cent in 2017 from 86.8 per cent

in 2016.

Revenue from income taxes as a percentage

of GDP declined marginally to 2.1 per cent in

2017 from 2.2 per cent in 2016. However, revenue

from income taxes in nominal terms increased by

6.1 per cent to Rs. 274.6 billion during the year

from Rs. 258.9 billion collected in the previous

year. Revenue from ESC recorded a notable

improvement during the year due to the lowering

of the ESC liability threshold to Rs. 12.5 million

per quarter from Rs. 50.0 million per quarter and

the imposition of ESC on the importation of motor

vehicles. Accordingly, revenue from ESC increased

by 118.6 per cent to Rs. 44.7 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 20.5 billion recorded during 2016. Moreover,

revenue from the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) tax

also improved during the year by 16.9 per cent to

Rs. 32.9 billion from Rs. 28.2 billion in 2016 as a

result of enhanced compliance with the initiation of

RAMIS. However, revenue from corporate and non

corporate income taxes declined to Rs. 143.6 billion

in 2017 from Rs. 154.3 billion in 2016 mainly due to

the capturing of profit making businesses into the

ESC tax net while granting ESC tax credit against

income tax payable which was implemented from

the second quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, revenue

from withholding tax also declined by 4.6 per cent to

Rs. 53.3 billion in 2017 from Rs. 55.9 billion in 2016

reflecting a decline in the issuance of Treasury bills

and Treasury bonds for deficit financing purposes

and the lower interest rates in comparison to the

previous year.

Responding to amendments made to the

VAT Act during the latter part of 2016, revenue

from VAT improved substantially in 2017.

Accordingly, revenue from VAT increased, both in

terms of GDP and in nominal terms, as a result of

the increase in the VAT rate to 15 per cent from

11 per cent, the expansion of the VAT base

through the removal of several exemptions granted

under the VAT Act, lowering of the registration

threshold of VAT to Rs. 3.0 million per quarter from

Rs. 3.75 million per quarter and improved

compliance with the initiation of RAMIS.

Accordingly, as a per cent of GDP, revenue

from VAT increased to 3.3 per cent in 2017 from

2.4 per cent in 2016, while in nominal terms

VAT revenue increased by 56.5 per cent to

Rs. 443.8 billion. The revenue collection from

VAT on domestic economic activities increased by

63.8 per cent to Rs. 275.4 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 168.1 billion in 2016. Meanwhile, revenue from

VAT on import related activities also increased

during the year by 46.0 per cent to Rs. 168.4 billion.

VAT revenue as a per cent of total tax revenue

also increased substantially during the year to

26.6 per cent from 19.4 per cent in 2016. In addition,

the contribution of VAT revenue to total revenue

also increased to 24.2 per cent in 2017 from

16.8 per cent in 2016.

Revenue from excise duties declined as a

per cent of GDP in 2017, although it increased

in nominal terms. The revenue collection

from excise duties remained the single largest

contributor to total tax revenue in 2017, although

the share of excise tax revenue in total tax revenue

declined to 28.1 per cent in 2017 from 31.1 per cent

in 2016. In nominal terms, the revenue collection

from excise duties increased by 3.2 per cent to

Rs. 469.5 billion from Rs. 455.0 billion mainly due

to the increase in the revenue from excise duty on

petroleum products and motor vehicles amidst the

decline in revenue from the excise duty on liquor,

cigarettes and tobacco. However, revenue from

excise duties as a percentage of GDP declined

to 3.5 per cent during the year from 3.8 per cent

in the previous year. Meanwhile, revenue from

the excise duty on petroleum products increased

by 32.8 per cent to Rs. 74.0 billion reflecting

the increase in the importation of petroleum

products during the year and the increase in the

excise duty on diesel during the latter part of

2016. Though vehicle imports declined due to

the imposition of the Loan to Value (LTV) ratio by

the Central Bank on credit extended by financial

institutions, the increase in applicable excise duty

rates resulted in a marginal increase in the revenue

collection from the excise duty on motor vehicles to

Rs. 189.7 billion in 2017. However, revenue

from excise duty on liquor recorded a decline of

5.5 per cent to Rs. 113.7 billion in 2017 mainly due

to the reduction in the sales of hard and malt liquor.

Revenue from excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco

declined by 3.1 per cent to Rs. 86.0 billion mainly due

to the deceleration in cigarette sales in 2017. The

decline in liquor and cigarette sales was largely due

to the increase in applicable excise duties and the

advertising campaign launched by the government

to reduce the consumption of cigarettes and liquor.

The revenue collection from import duties

was lower in 2017 while revenue from SCL

increased in comparison to 2016. Accordingly,

revenue from import duties, both in nominal terms

and as a per cent of GDP, declined during the year

as a result of duty waivers granted, especially on

petrol, diesel and milk powder. Revenue from import

duties as a per cent of GDP declined to 1.0 per cent,

in 2017, from 1.3 per cent in 2016 and in nominal

terms, revenue from import duties declined by

12.8 per cent to Rs. 136.5 billion in 2017. The share

of import duty in tax revenue decelerated during

2017 to 8.2 per cent from 10.7 per cent recorded

in 2016. Meanwhile, revenue from SCL increased

significantly in nominal terms by 27.9 per cent to

Rs. 71.4 billion from Rs. 55.8 billion as a result of

the increase in SCL rates applicable on several

commodities to safeguard the farming community.

The share of SCL in tax revenue increased to

4.3 per cent from 3.8 per cent in the previous year.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Revenue from all other taxes showed a mixed

performance during the year. Accordingly,

revenue from PAL recorded an increase of

15.2 per cent to Rs. 102.4 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 88.8 billion in 2016 in response to the

increase in the importation of several goods that are

subject to PAL. However, revenue from the Cess

Levy declined during the year by 3.5 per cent to

Rs. 59.6 billion, in 2017, from Rs. 61.7 billion in

2016 owing to the removal of Cess Levy on a

number of imported items in the budgets 2017

and 2018 with a view of phasing out para tariffs

applicable on the importation of several goods.

Revenue from NBT increased in nominal terms by

20.2 per cent to Rs. 69.0 billion during the year

mainly due to the increase in revenue from

domestic economic activities. Accordingly, NBT

revenue from domestic economic activities

increased by 27.4 per cent to Rs. 49.7 billion

while revenue from import related activities

increased by 5.0 per cent to Rs. 19.3 billion during

the year. The improvement in revenue from

NBT on domestic economic activities is mainly

due to the removal of exemptions granted on

several services from November 2016. Revenue

from the Telecommunication Levy declined by

7.2 per cent to Rs. 33.4 billion in comparision

to Rs. 36.0 billion in 2016, mainly due to the

removal of the 10 per cent Telecommunication

Levy, which was applicable to internet services,

with effect from 01 September 2017.

Non tax revenue declined in 2017 both

as a per cent of GDP and in nominal

terms. Accordingly, non tax revenue as a per

cent of GDP declined to 1.2 per cent from

1.9 per cent in 2016 mainly due to the weakened

financial performance of major SOBEs during

the year. In nominal terms, non tax revenue

declined by 27.4 per cent to Rs. 161.4 billion, in

2017, from Rs. 222.4 billion in 2016. Profit and

dividend transfers from major SOBEs in 2017

declined by 50.1 per cent to Rs. 54.0 billion from

Rs. 108.2 billion in the previous year. Meanwhile,

revenue from rent income declined by

59.5 per cent to Rs. 4.5 billion, in 2017, while

revenue from interest income increased by

53.2 per cent to Rs. 7.4 billion. Revenue from social

security contributions increased by 27.1 per cent to

Rs. 22.9 billion, in 2017, from Rs. 18.0 billion

in 2016 mainly due to the increase in the basic

salary of public servants with the inclusion of

the interim and non pensionable allowances

to the basic salary. Further, revenue from

fees and charges declined marginally to

Rs. 66.6 billion from Rs. 68.4 billion in 2016.

Accordingly, the share of non tax revenue

in total revenue declined during the year to

8.8 per cent from 13.2 per cent in 2016.

Grants

Total foreign grants received from

multilateral and bilateral sources during

the year increased to Rs. 8.0 billion from

Rs. 7.5 billion in 2016. Grants from multilateral

sources increased by 6.8 per cent to Rs. 5.5 billion

in 2017 compared to 2016. However, the share of

grants from multilateral sources out of total grants

broadly remained at around the same level of

68.0 per cent in 2017 vis-a-vis 2016. Meanwhile,

grants from bilateral sources increased by

7.9 per cent to Rs. 2.6 billion in 2017. The

major development partners who provided

grants during the year were the International

Development Association (IDA), the World

Food Programme (WFP) and the Government

of Japan.

Expenditure and Net Lending

Total expenditure and net lending as a per

cent of GDP declined to 19.4 per cent in 2017

from 19.6 per cent in 2016 reflecting efforts

taken to rationalise recurrent expenditure.

Accordingly, as a per cent of GDP, recurrent

expenditure declined to 14.5 per cent while capital

expenditure and net lending increased marginally

to 4.9 per cent during the year. Public investment,

which includes capital expenditure and lending

of the government, declined to 4.9 per cent in

2017 from 5.0 per cent in 2016. In nominal terms,

total expenditure and net lending increased by

10.2 per cent to Rs. 2,573.1 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 2,333.9 billion in 2016.

Recurrent expenditure as a per cent of

GDP declined to 14.5 per cent in 2017 from

14.8 per cent in 2016. However, in nominal

terms, recurrent expenditure increased by 9.7

per cent to Rs. 1,927.7 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 1,757.8 billion in 2016. Increase in interest

payments and expenditure incurred on disaster

relief measures mainly contributed to this increase

in recurrent expenditure in nominal terms. As a

percentage of GDP, lower salaries and wages as

well as current transfers and subsidies contributed

to the reduction in recurrent expenditure amidst the

considerable increase in interest payments.

Interest payments as a percentage of

GDP increased to 5.5 per cent, in 2017, from

5.1 per cent in 2016. In nominal terms, interest

expenditure increased by 20.4 per cent to

Rs. 735.6 billion in 2017 from Rs. 610.9 billion,

in 2016, mainly due to higher interest payments

on Treasury bonds and outstanding foreign

debt. Interest payments on domestic debt, which

increased by 17.9 per cent to Rs. 570.6 billion, in

2017, from Rs. 484.2 billion in 2016, accounting for

77.6 per cent of total interest payments in 2017.

Rs. 438.2 billion, in 2017, rose by 22.8 per cent

mainly due to the increased net issuances of

Treasury bonds in 2016 at higher interest rates.

Interest payments on Treasury bills increased

marginally by 3.2 per cent to Rs. 81.3 billion in

2017 from Rs. 78.8 billion in 2016. In addition,

interest payments on Sri Lanka Development

Bonds (SLDBs) and Rupee loans amounted to

Rs. 33.8 billion and Rs. 2.9 billion, respectively,

in 2017. Interest expenditure on foreign debt

increased significantly by 30.2 per cent to

Rs. 164.9 billion in 2017 from Rs. 126.7 billion

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

in 2016 mainly due to the rise in the foreign debt

stock in the recent past, especially the increase

in outstanding commercial loans including ISBs.

Interest payments continued to be the single

largest recurrent expenditure item, accounting for

38.2 per cent of total recurrent expenditure and

40.2 per cent of government revenue in 2017.

Expenditure on goods and services

declined to 5.7 per cent of GDP in 2017 from

6.3 per cent in 2016. However, in nominal terms

expenditure on goods and services increased by

1.4 per cent to Rs. 756.6 billion from Rs. 746.3

billion in 2016. Salaries and wages, the largest

expenditure item in this category, declined to 4.4

per cent of GDP in 2017 from 4.8 per cent of GDP

in 2016, although in nominal terms it increased by

2.1 per cent to Rs. 588.5 billion. Salaries and wages

paid to central government employees, including

defence personnel, increased by 1.4 per cent to

Rs. 438.8 billion, while the central government

contribution to salaries and wages of Provincial

Council (PC) employees increased by

4.2 per cent to Rs. 149.7 billion during the year.

This was mainly due to the continuation of the

conversion of interim allowance to the basic salary

with the implementation of the new salary structure

from January 2016 for public sector employees.

Salaries and wages continued to be the second

largest recurrent expenditure item with its share

in recurrent expenditure marginally reducing to

30.5 per cent in 2017 from 32.8 per cent in 2016.

Further, expenditure on other goods and services,

as a per cent of GDP, declined marginally to

1.3 per cent in 2017 from 1.4 per cent in 2016.

Similarly, in nominal terms, expenditure on other

goods and services declined by 1.0 per cent to

Rs. 168.1 billion in 2017.

Total current transfers and subsidies, as

a percentage of GDP declined to 3.3 per cent

in 2017 from 3.4 per cent in 2016 mainly due

to the reduction in current transfers to public

corporations and households. However, in

nominal terms, current transfers and subsidies

rose by 8.7 per cent to Rs. 435.5 billion in 2017

in comparison to Rs. 400.6 billion in 2016. This

was the combined outcome of an increase in

both current transfers to public institutions and

households. Current transfers to households

and other sectors accounted for 80.5 per cent of

total current transfers, while transfers to public

institutions and public corporations accounted for

12.5 per cent and 7.1 per cent, respectively, in

2017.

Current transfers to households which

include pension payments, declined

marginally to 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2017 from

2.7 per cent of GDP in 2016. However, in nominal

terms, current transfers to households increased by

10.5 per cent to Rs. 350.4 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 317.2 billion in 2016. Pension payments,

the largest item under transfers to households,

increased by 5.3 per cent to Rs. 181.1 billion in 2017

due to the increase in the number of pensioners

during the year by 21,338 to 600,752. However,

the expenditure on the Samurdhi programme at

Rs. 39.7 billion declined marginally by 2.5 per cent

from Rs. 40.7 billion in the previous year. In addition,

expenditure on welfare programmes for disabled

Current transfers to public institutions in

2017 remained unchanged at 0.4 per cent of

GDP as in the previous year, while current

transfers to public corporations declined

marginally to 0.2 per cent of GDP during the

year. However, in nominal terms, current transfers

to public institutions increased while current

transfers to public corporations declined during

the year. Current transfers to public institutions

increased by 8.2 per cent to Rs. 54.4 billion during

the year due to the increase in current transfers to

the education sector. However, current transfers

to public corporations declined by 7.5 per cent

to Rs. 30.7 billion reflecting efforts taken by the

government to improve the efficiency in public

corporations, although transfers provided to cover

operational losses of the Department of Sri Lanka

Railways and the Department of Posts increased

marginally.

Amidst the limited fiscal space available,

capital expenditure and net lending as a

4.9 per cent in 2017 from 4.8 per cent in 2016.

However, in nominal terms, capital expenditure

soldiers increased by 4.2 per cent to Rs. 27.8 billion

in 2017 from Rs. 26.7 billion in 2016. Provision of

uniforms, textbooks and the nutrition programme for

school children were among the other major subsidies

provided to households during 2017. Meanwhile,

expenditure on the fertiliser subsidy increased

by 9.3 per cent to Rs. 30.4 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 27.8 billion in 2016. Further, recurrent

expenditure incurred on disaster relief measures

was around 0.1 per cent of GDP.

expenditure and lending of the government, declined

to 4.9 per cent in 2017 from 5.0 per cent in the

previous year. In nominal terms, public investment

increased by 10.7 per cent to Rs. 657.4 billion in

2017 from Rs. 594.0 billion in 2016. Expenditure

incurred by Ministries and Departments on the

acquisition of real assets, including the purchase of

capital assets and construction and development

of fixed assets, increased by 9.8 per cent to

Rs. 360.3 billion in 2017 from Rs. 328.2 billion in

2016. Capital transfers increased by 11.7 per cent

to Rs. 278.0 billion due to the increase in capital

transfers to public institutions by 16.7 per cent.

Meanwhile, on lending of the government to public

corporations at Rs. 19.0 billion in 2017 increased

by 12.2 per cent from Rs. 17.0 billion recorded in

2016.

The government continued its investments

in economic and social services during the

year. Accordingly, public investments in economic

and social services amounted to Rs. 474.1 billion

and Rs. 135.3 billion, respectively in 2017. Public

investments in economic services were mainly

directed towards developing the transportation

network of the country while public investments

in social services focused mainly on improving

infrastructure in education and health sectors.

Accordingly, a significant amount of investments

was made in road development of the country.

Further, efforts were taken to upgrade the

infrastructure in the education sector through “The

Nearest School is the Best School Programme”,

while rehabilitating schools affected by floods and

landslides. Meanwhile, public investments in the

health sector focused mainly on constructing and

improving ward complexes, establishing kidney

dialysis centers and modern pharmaceutical

laboratories while upgrading training schools in

order to enhance the quality of service delivery of

the health sector.

Key Fiscal Balances

Reflecting improvements in non interest

expenditure, the primary balance recorded a

surplus during the year although the budget

balance and the current account balance

deteriorated marginally due to the slippages

in the total revenue collection. Accordingly,

the primary balance which excludes interest

payments recorded a surplus of Rs. 2.1 billion

in 2017 as against the deficit of Rs. 29.4 billion

observed in 2016 reflecting improved expenditure

management through budgetary operations

during the year. The reduction in the revenue

collection to 13.8 per cent of GDP, in 2017, from

14.2 per cent in 2016 contributed to the increase

in the overall budget deficit to 5.5 per cent in

2017 from 5.4 per cent in the previous

year despite the decline in government

expenditure and net lending. In line with this,

the current account deficit, which indicates the

government’s dissavings, also increased to

0.7 per cent of GDP in 2017 from 0.6 per cent of

GDP in the previous year.

Financing of the Budget Deficit

The overall budget deficit was financed

largely through foreign sources in 2017.

Accordingly, financing through foreign sources

accounted for 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2017 as

against the budgetary target of 2.5 per cent of

GDP. In terms of the overall budget deficit,

59.9 per cent of the resource requirement

(Rs. 439.2 billion) was financed through foreign

sources in 2017 compared to 61.2 per cent

(Rs. 391.9 billion) in 2016. Consequently,

the share of financing through domestic

sources increased to 40.1 per cent

(Rs. 294.3 billion) in 2017, while as a percentage of

GDP financing through domestic sources increased

to 2.2 per cent in 2017 from 2.1 per cent in 2016.

of net domestic financing, in 2017, compared to

56.3 per cent (Rs. 140.0 billion) in 2016. The increase

was due to the significant rise in commercial bank

financing amounting to Rs. 375.7 billion, in 2017, as

against a net repayment of Rs. 43.1 billion in 2016.

The increase in financing through commercial

banks was mainly due to the rise in Treasury bill

holdings of commercial banks to Rs. 200.9 billion

and the rise in holdings of SLDBs to Rs. 53.3 billion.

However, the impact of commercial bank financing

on government domestic financing was partly

offset by the net repayment to the Central Bank of

Rs. 187.9 billion. Financing from the Central Bank

reduced mainly due to the retirement of Treasury

bill holdings of the Central Bank of Rs. 304.5 billion

in 2017. Meanwhile, financing from the non bank

sector reduced to Rs. 61.8 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 108.5 billion in 2016.

Domestic borrowings of the government by

way of instruments, in net terms, further declined,

in 2017, whereas non instrument borrowings

increased significantly. Accordingly, borrowings

by way of domestic instruments declined to

Rs. 80.8 billion in 2017 from Rs. 327.8 billion

in 2016 while non instrument borrowings

increased by Rs. 213.5 billion in 2017 compared

Funds mobilised through foreign sources

increased in 2017 mainly due to the issuance

of International Sovereign Bonds and the

raising of the Foreign Currency Term Financing

Facility. Accordingly, financing of the budget

deficit through foreign borrowings increased to

Rs. 439.2 billion or 59.9 per cent of the overall budget

deficit in 2017 in comparison to Rs. 391.9 billion or

61.2 per cent in 2016. Net foreign financing comprised

Rs. 228.5 billion (US dollars 1.5 billion) of ISBs,

Rs. 152.7 billion (US dollars 1.0 billion) of FCTFF,

Rs. 43.7 billion of foreign investments in Treasury

bonds, Rs. 13.6 billion of foreign investments in

Treasury bills and Rs. 779.0 million of net borrowings

through foreign project loans. Borrowings through

foreign project loans on a gross basis amounted to

Rs. 220.1 billion as against the repayment of a sum

of Rs. 219.4 billion in 2017. The Export-Import Bank

of China (Exim Bank), IDA, the Government of Japan

and Asian Development Bank (ADB) were the main

sources of foreign project financing in 2017.

In financing the budget deficit through

domestic sources, the government relied more

on domestic banking sources in 2017 while the

contribution from the non bank sector declined.

Accordingly, borrowings from banking sources

accounted for 63.8 per cent (Rs. 187.7 billion)

to the net repayment of Rs. 79.4 billion in

2016, mainly due to higher borrowings through

provisional advances and commercial bank

overdrafts. Borrowings through Treasury

bonds declined to Rs. 109.1 billion in 2017

from Rs. 349.8 billion in 2016. Meanwhile, a

net repayment of Treasury bills amounting to

Rs. 81.7 billion was recorded in 2017 as

against a net borrowing of Rs. 98.5 billion in

2016. Borrowings through SLDBs in net terms

amounted to Rs. 53.3 billion as against a net

repayment of Rs. 120.5 billion in 2016.

Foreign currency denominated domestic

borrowings increased, in 2017, due to higher

borrowings from both SLDBs and offshore

banking units (OBUs). Accordingly, borrowings

through SLDBs increased on a net basis to

Rs. 53.3 billion while borrowings through

OBUs increased more than threefold, on a

net basis, to Rs. 33.3 billion in 2017. The

increase in borrowings through SLDBs was

the difference between gross borrowing of

Rs. 338.5 billion (US dollars 2.2 billion) and

gross repayment of Rs. 285.2 billion (US

dollars 1.9 billion). On a net basis, foreign

currency borrowings from domestic sources

amounted to Rs. 86.6 billion in 2017 compared

to the net repayment of Rs. 112.9 billion in 2016,

while rupee denominated net domestic financing

amounted to Rs. 207.7 billion compared to

Rs. 361.3 billion in 2016.

6.4 Government Debt and Debt Service Payments

Central Government Debt

The central government debt to GDP ratio

declined to 77.6 per cent at end 2017 from

78.8 per cent at end 2016. A reduction in the debt

to GDP ratio was observed in 2017 as a result

of the higher growth in nominal GDP relative to

the nominal growth in the debt stock. However,

in absolute terms, the total outstanding central

government debt stock increased by 9.9 per cent

to Rs. 10,313.0 billion at end 2017. Increase in the

central government debt stock by Rs. 925.7 billion

was mainly due to the increase in net borrowings

and the depreciation of the rupee against foreign

currencies. Domestic debt as a percentage of

GDP declined notably to 42.1 per cent by end

2017 from 44.9 per cent at end 2016, while foreign

debt increased to 35.5 per cent of GDP at the end

of 2017 from 34.0 per cent of GDP at end 2016.

Of this increase, Rs. 225.2 billion was due to the

depreciation of the rupee against major foreign

at end 2016. The outstanding on account of

provisional advances increased significantly

to Rs. 199.8 billion at end 2017 from

Rs. 83.3 billion at end 2016. However, the impact

of the increase in provisional advances on short

term debt stock was largely negated by the

decline in the Treasury bill stock held by domestic

investors to Rs. 697.2 billion, in 2017, from

Rs. 779.6 billion in 2016. Meanwhile, the share

of medium to long term debt in the domestic debt

stock declined marginally to 81.6 per cent in 2017.

Treasury bonds, a medium term debt instrument,

accounted for 68.3 per cent of the total domestic

debt stock at end 2017, increasing its outstanding

amount to Rs. 3,822.6 billion at end 2017 from

Rs. 3,714.8 billion at end 2016. Meanwhile, the

stock of SLDBs rose to Rs. 637.9 billion at end

2017.

The debt obligation of the central government

to the domestic banking sector increased to

Rs. 2,328.5 billion at end 2017, although debt

owed to the Central Bank reduced significantly

to Rs. 209.4 billion at end 2017 from

Rs. 415.0 billion at end 2016. Accordingly, the

share of the banking sector debt in total domestic

debt increased to 41.6 per cent by end 2017

currencies. Meanwhile, the discount factor (which

is the net amount of the difference between

the book value and the face value of issuances

and maturities of Treasury bills and Treasury

bonds) contributed to decline the debt stock by

Rs. 17.2 billion due to the net repayment of

government securities issued at a discount during

2017.

The share of domestic debt in the total

outstanding debt stock declined consecutively

for the second year to 54.2 per cent at end 2017

from 56.9 per cent at end 2016 mainly due to

lower borrowings from domestic sources. In

nominal terms, the domestic debt stock increased

only by 4.7 per cent in 2017 to Rs. 5,594.4 billion

at end 2017 in comparison to an increase of

7.7 per cent in 2016. The share of short term debt

from 39.6 per cent at end 2016. The reduction

in the debt held by the Central Bank was driven

by the repayment of Treasury bills amounting to

Rs. 321.5 billion during the year 2017. However,

the debt stock on account of provisional advances

increased during the year to Rs. 199.8 billion. The

outstanding debt owned by commercial banks

increased to Rs. 2,119.1 billion at end 2017 mainly

due to higher investments in Treasury bills by

commercial banks. The stock of Treasury bills held

by commercial banks rose to Rs. 463.2 billion at

end 2017. The share of non bank sector debt in

total domestic debt reduced further to 58.4 per cent,

in 2017, from 60.4 per cent in the previous year,

although the non bank sector owned debt increased

marginally in 2017 recording an outstanding of

Rs. 3,265.9 billion.

Foreign currency denominated domestic

debt increased substantially in 2017 recording

an outstanding debt of Rs. 702.1 billion at end

2017. The debt stock on account of SLDBs rose

to Rs. 637.9 billion (US dollars 4.17 billion) at end

2017 while loans obtained from OBUs increased

to Rs. 64.2 billion (US dollars 420 million) at end

2017. Meanwhile, rupee denominated domestic

debt at Rs. 4,892.3 billion at end 2017 increased

by Rs. 153.0 billion during 2017.

Total stock of foreign debt of the central

government continued to increase in

2017 with higher borrowings from foreign

sources. The outstanding stock of foreign debt

increased to Rs. 4,718.6 billion at end 2017 from

Rs. 4,045.8 billion at end 2016. The financing of

the budget deficit largely through foreign sources,

especially non concessional loans, was the main

reason for the rise in foreign debt. Non concessional

loans, including commercial loans, increased to

Rs. 2,588.1 billion in 2017 mainly due to the

issuance of ISBs (US dollars 1.5 billion), issuance

of FTCFF (US dollars 1.0 billion) and increase in

outstanding foreign holdings of Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds (Rs. 62.6 billion). Accordingly,

the share of non concessional loans in the foreign

debt portfolio increased to 54.8 per cent from

53.1 per cent in 2016. Meanwhile, with the issuance

of ISBs in 2017, the outstanding stock of ISBs

increased to Rs. 1,475.0 billion (US dollars 9.65

billion) at end 2017.

The depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee

against several major currencies increased

the total debt stock, in rupee terms, by

Rs. 225.2 billion at end 2017. The Sri Lankan

rupee depreciated by 2.0 per cent, 5.1 per cent,

foreign sources rose significantly by 31.7 per cent to

Rs. 389.6 billion during 2017. Amortisation

payments increased by 17.0 per cent to

Rs. 867.5 billion in 2017 mainly due to the higher

amortisation payments on Treasury bonds by

44.9 per cent to Rs. 355.9 billion as well as the

increased amortisation payments on foreign

loans by 32.8 per cent to Rs. 224.5 billion.

Meanwhile, total interest payments increased

by 20.4 per cent to Rs. 735.6 billion in 2017

compared to the previous year. Increase in

7.5 per cent, 7.5 per cent, 10.5 per cent and

13.5 per cent, respectively, against the US dollar,

the Japanese yen, the Indian rupee, Special

Drawing Rights (SDR), the pound sterling and the

euro during the year. The government foreign debt

stock consisted of debt denominated in US dollars

(56.2 per cent), SDR (17.6 per cent), Japanese yen

(10.9 per cent), euro (4.4 per cent) and other

currencies (10.9 per cent) as at end 2017.

Consequently, the outstanding stock of foreign

debt increased by Rs. 211.9 billion mainly due to

the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against

major foreign currencies, while foreign currency

denominated domestic debt stock (SLDBs and

loans from OBUs) increased by Rs. 13.4 billion

due to the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee

against the US dollar. Although the depreciation

of the Sri Lankan rupee would be reflected as

an increase in the government foreign currency

debt stock in rupee terms, the accumulated debt

stock denominated in foreign currency would

remain unchanged in terms of foreign currency,

irrespective of such depreciation. As this debt stock

denominated in foreign currency would be serviced

using foreign currency inflows to the government,

the impact of its increase in rupee terms will be

negated. Therefore, the change in the value of

debt stock in rupee terms due to depreciation or

appreciation of the rupee can neither be considered

as an additional real expenditure nor be considered

as a real savings on net basis for the government.

Central Government Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments rose by

18.5 per cent in nominal terms to Rs. 1,603.0

billion in 2017 from Rs. 1,352.4 billion in 2016

due to increases in both amortisation and

interest payments. Debt service payments to

domestic sources increased by 14.8 per cent to

Rs. 1,213.5 billion while debt service payments to

domestic interest payments was mainly due to

higher interest payments on Treasury bonds by

22.8 per cent amounting to Rs. 438.2 billion in

2017. This was largely due to the higher interest

rates that prevailed in the market until mid 2017.

Interest payments on foreign loans rose by

29.6 per cent (Rs. 37.4 billion) to Rs. 164.0 billion

in 2017 in comparison to 2016 mainly due to

the increase in interest payments on account of

foreign commercial borrowings.

The main indicators on debt service

payments displayed a weak performance in

2017 reflecting the increase in debt service

payments. Total debt service payments

increased to 12.1 per cent of GDP in 2017

from 11.4 per cent of GDP in the previous year.

Amortisation payments for domestic debt as

a percentage of GDP remained unchanged at

4.8 per cent in 2017 while amortisation payments

on foreign debt increased to 1.7 per cent of

GDP in 2017 from 1.4 per cent of GDP in 2016.

Total interest payments as a percentage of

GDP increased to 5.5 per cent in 2017 from

5.1 per cent in 2016. Interest payments for

domestic sources increased to 4.3 per cent

of GDP in 2017 from 4.1 per cent of GDP in

2016 while interest payments on foreign debt

increased to 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2017 from

1.1 per cent of GDP in the previous year. Moreover,

the ratio of debt service payments to government

revenue increased to 87.5 per cent in 2017 from

80.2 per cent in 2016.

Outstanding Debt of Major Public Non Financial Corporations

The outstanding debt of major public

non financial corporations4, which includes

debt to the domestic banking sector and

project related foreign debt declined as a

percentage of GDP in 2017. Accordingly, the

debt to GDP ratio of major public non financial

corporations declined to 6.4 per cent by end

2017 from 6.9 per cent in the previous year.

However, in nominal terns, total outstanding

debt of major public non financial corporations

increased to Rs. 844.6 billion at end 2017

from Rs. 827.4 billion at end 2016. Domestic

debt of public non financial corporations to

domestic commercial banks increased to

Rs. 514.4 billion from Rs. 495.1 billion, accounting

for 60.9 per cent of the total outstanding debt

of major non financial corporations. Meanwhile,

project related foreign debt increased to

Rs. 330.2 billion. The relative share of project

related foreign debt to total outstanding debt

of major public non financial corporations

declined to 39.1 per cent at end 2017 from

40.2 per cent at end 2016.

4 This includes outstanding debt related to Hambantota Port of SLPA.

6.5 Budgetary Operations in Sub National Governments

Policy Direction and Measures taken by Sub National Governments

The Ministry of Provincial Councils and

Local Government (MPCLG) continued to play a

vital role in providing policy guidance to the sub

national governments in 2017. The sub national

government system in Sri Lanka comprises nine

PCs and 341 Local Government authorities (LGs).

At end 2017, the LG system comprised 22 Municipal

Councils, 43 Urban Councils and 276 Pradesheeya

Sabhas. The MPCLG continued to work closely

with sub national government authorities, in order

to identify the development needs at the sub

national level and to facilitate investments with a

view to achieving balanced regional development.

At the sub national government level, priority

was given to infrastructure development

projects in order to uplift the living standards of

the people. The Local Government Enhancement

Sector Project (Pura Neguma programme)

continued in 2017 with the objective of improving

social services such as health facilities, library

facilities and day care centres while implementing

water supply projects and improving Pradeshiya

Sabha roads. Moreover, in order to enhance

the quality of the service delivery of Pradeshiya

Sabhas, measures were taken to automate their

activities. Transforming School Education as

the Foundation of a Knowledge Hub project and

Library Development Programme were continued

during the year in order to improve educational

facilities. The Health Sector Development Project

also continued during the year with the objective of

controlling and preventing communicable and non

communicable diseases while improving maternal

and child health care facilities. In addition, Greater

Colombo Water and Waste Water Management

Programme, Strengthening of Local Governments-

Pradeshiya Sabhas, Jaffna-Killinochchi Water

Supply and Sanitation Project and the Construction

of Rural Bridges Project, Supply of Garbage

Collecting Compactors to Local Authorities, Rural

Infrastructure Development Project in Emerging

Regions and Development of 1,000 km of road

length in rural areas were also continued during the

year. Several infrastructure development projects

related to sub national government level were

completed during the year including, North East

Local Services Improvement Project, Northern

Roads Connectivity Project, Iranamadu Irrigation

Development Project and “Dorin Dorata-Gamin

Gamata” Programme. Further, in order to protect the

environment while creating a healthy atmosphere,

the National Solid Waste Management Project

commenced in 2017. Under this project, actions

have been taken to promote household composting

and waste segregation while constructing compost

yards and waste collecting centers.

The Finance Commission recommended

several measures during the year for

implementation in 2018, with the objective of

achieving balanced regional development.

Accordingly, the Commission recommended to

establish a Management Information System

(MIS) which caters for national and sub national

level information requirement for planning and

monitoring in order to improve the effectiveness

of the decision making process. Further, the

Commission recommended that funds disbursed for

development activities coming under the devolved

subjects should be channeled through the PCs,

in order to ensure the effective utilisation of funds

and to maintain transparency and accountability

of investments. Moreover, recommendations were

made to enhance provincial revenue mobilisation

through untapped revenue sources such as private

schools, tutorial classes, local and foreign colleges

of higher education, health service providers and

professional service providers while allowing the

PCs to collect NBT from business entities which

earn quarterly income up to Rs. 3.0 million. The

Commission made further recommendations on

introducing an incentive package which includes

interest subsidies, tax holidays, concessional tax

rates and loan schemes for private investors who

are willing to invest in rural areas. This initiative

is expected to create more space in the public

investment programme which would enable the

government to invest in other priority sectors.

In addition, a proposal was made to introduce a

Revenue Performance Grant, which is based on the

incremental devolved revenue collection in order to

incentivise the province wise revenue collection.

Budgetary Operations in Provincial Councils

Tax revenue of PCs continued to increase in

nominal terms in 2017 although as a percentage

of GDP, tax revenue remained at the same level

as in 2016. Total revenue of PCs increased by

7.0 per cent to Rs. 85.2 billion in 2017 from Rs.

79.6 billion in 2016 mainly due to increased NBT

revenue transferred from the central government.

However, as a percentage of GDP, total revenue

declined marginally to 0.6 per cent in 2017 from

0.7 per cent in 2016. In nominal terms, tax revenue

increased by 8.0 per cent to Rs. 76.6 billion,

while non tax revenue declined by 1.0 per cent to

Rs. 8.6 billion in 2017 from Rs. 8.7 billion in

2016. Transfers of NBT revenue from the

central government, which became the single

largest contributor to the total tax revenue of

PCs in 2017, increased by 27.4 per cent to

Rs. 32.3 billion. This was mainly due to the removal

of exemptions granted on several goods and

services in November 2016 and August 2017 and

the reduction in the registration threshold for NBT to

Rs. 3.0 million per quarter from Rs. 3.75 million per

quarter with effect from November 2016. However,

revenue from stamp duty declined by 3.3 per cent

to Rs. 31.5 billion in 2017 from Rs. 32.5 billion

in 2016 reflecting the lower revenue collection

from stamp duty on transferring deeds. Revenue

from license fees increased by 5.9 per cent to

Rs. 10.9 billion in 2017. Transfers of NBT revenue

from the central government and revenue from

stamp duty accounted for 42.1 per cent and

41.1 per cent of total tax revenue of PCs,

respectively. The relative share of the Western

Provincial Council on the revenue collection

increased marginally to 51.9 per cent in 2017

from 51.8 per cent in 2016. The Western

Province was followed by the Southern and

North Western provinces accounting for

9.5 per cent and 9.4 per cent, respectively of the

total revenue collection of PCs. Meanwhile, the

relative share of the Sabaragamuwa Province

in the revenue collection declined notably to

4.4 per cent in 2017 from 5.3 per cent in 2016.

Recurrent expenditure of PCs in 2017

declined marginally both in nominal terms

and as a percentage of GDP. Accordingly, in

nominal terms, recurrent expenditure declined

by 0.5 per cent to Rs. 236.6 billion in 2017 from

Rs. 237.7 billion in 2016 while as a percentage

of GDP, recurrent expenditure declined to

1.8 per cent in 2017 from 2.0 per cent in

2016. The reduction in recurrent expenditure

was mainly due to lower outlays in all major

categories including maintenance and travelling

expenses except personal emoluments. Personal

emoluments at Rs. 187.0 billion increased by

2.5 per cent and continued to be the single largest

item in the recurrent expenditure accounting for

79.1 per cent of the total recurrent expenditure of

PCs. Education and health sectors absorbed nearly

90 per cent of the personal emoluments of PCs. On

a functional basis, recurrent expenditure on social

services increased by 1.4 per cent to Rs. 214.5

billion, while recurrent expenditure on provincial

administration and economic services declined by

15.4 per cent and 14.4 per cent to Rs. 18.1 billion

and Rs. 4.0 billion, respectively in 2017. In terms

of total recurrent expenditure, the three highest

spending PCs were the Western, the Central and

the North Western accounting for 21.3 per cent,

12.5 per cent and 11.8 per cent, respectively.

Capital expenditure as a percentage of

GDP, increased to 0.4 per cent in 2017 from

0.3 per cent in 2016, while in nominal terms

capital expenditure increased by 28.5 per cent

to Rs. 49.5 billion in 2017. This was mainly

due to the increase in Province Specific

Development Projects (PSDPs) by 66.3 per cent to

Rs. 20.3 billion in 2017 from Rs. 12.2 billion in

2016. Both acquisition of capital assets and

capital expenditure on Special Projects declined

during the year. However, capital transfers to

local governments increased by 28.1 per cent to

Rs. 2.3 billion in 2017.

In 2017, transfers from the central

government to PCs through block grants,

grants for special projects, Province Specific

Development Grants (PSDGs) and Criteria

Based Grants (CBGs) increased by 2.2 per cent

to Rs. 200.9 billion. Block grants, the major form

of central government transfers to PCs, amounted

to Rs. 166.3 billion, representing 82.8 per cent

of the total transfers that were provided to meet

the resource gap in the recurrent expenditure

programme of PCs. Transfers under grants for

special projects, PSDGs and CBGs amounted to

Rs. 11.0 billion, Rs. 20.3 billion and Rs. 3.2 billion,

respectively. During the year 70.2 per cent of the

expenditure of PCs was financed through central

government transfers which emphasises that more

efforts and policy direction are needed in order to

enhance the revenue mobilisation of PCs.
