7.1 OverviewT

he Central Bank continued to maintain its

tight monetary policy stance in 2017 to curtail

the build up of adverse inflation expectations

and the possible acceleration of demand driven

inflationary pressures through excessive monetary

and credit expansion. The policy interest rates of the

Central Bank were increased by 25 basis points in

March 2017, further to the 100 basis point increase

in policy interest rates and the 1.50 percentage

point increase in the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR)

in 2016. Macroprudential measures, such as the

imposition of loan to value ratios (LTV) on account

of credit facilities for motor vehicles, also buttressed

the tight monetary policy stance.

The Central Bank also pursued a more market

based exchange rate policy to complement the

conduct of monetary policy. Nevertheless, the

Central Bank’s efforts to maintain inflation in a range

of 4.0-6.0 per cent, as announced, were undermined

mainly by adverse domestic supply side shocks.

Disturbances to domestic food supplies, caused by

prolonged adverse weather conditions, along with

the base effect associated with the implementation

of changes to the tax structure caused inflation to

trend upwards during most of 2017. Accordingly,

during 2017, headline inflation remained mostly

above the Central Bank’s targeted range, compared

to lower levels that prevailed over the past several

years. However, the Central Bank was able to

control demand driven inflation, as measured by the

movements in core inflation, particularly towards the

latter part of the year, with the gradual transmission

of the tight monetary policy stance maintained

over the past two years. Effective communication

policies of the Central Bank helped manage inflation

expectations of the public to reduce wage pressures

and resultant second round inflationary pressures.

High food inflation drove up headline inflation

beyond the expected levels. Despite this, headline

inflation was maintained within the inner band of the

quarterly targets under the Extended Fund Facility

(EFF) programme of the International Monetary

Fund (IMF) during the first three quarters of 2017.

Subsequently, inflation remained within the outer

band of the target range in the last quarter of the

year. Inflation reverted to mid-single digit levels in

early 2018.

In response to the tight monetary policy

stance of the Central Bank and the deficit liquidity

position in the domestic money market, the

7

Monetary Policy, Interest Rates, Money and Credit

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

222

Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR)

hovered around the upper bound of the policy

rate corridor until mid July 2017. However, the

AWCMR declined gradually thereafter in response

to improved liquidity conditions, and the Central

Bank conducted open market operations (OMO)

actively to stabilise the rate around the middle of

the corridor. The Central Bank was able to maintain

short term interest rates at desired levels with the

active and prudent management of liquidity in

the domestic money market. Meanwhile, with the

introduction of a new auction system for Treasury

bonds and improved market sentiments, yields

on government securities in the primary market

recorded a substantial decline during the year from

their peak rates registered in April 2017, correcting

a significant gap that existed between the policy

rates and the yields on government securities. Most

other market interest rates were also on an upward

trend at the beginning of the year and stabilised

at higher levels thereafter, though deposit rates

indicated some moderation towards end 2017.

High real and nominal interest rates, which were

the outcomes of tight monetary conditions, yielded

desired effects in relation to monetary and credit

aggregates. The growth of broad money that was

at persistently high levels since 2016 began to

decelerate gradually from September 2017 and

reached the desired level by end 2017, reflecting

the transmission of the tight monetary policy

stance, albeit with a lag. Contributing mainly to the

slowdown in monetary expansion, the deceleration

that was observed in the growth of credit extended

to the private sector by commercial banks, since

July 2016, continued throughout 2017 and reached

the desired level by end 2017, while the expansion

in Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking system

also contributed positively to broad money growth.

Considering the moderation in inflation during the

first quarter of 2018 and the favourable inflation

outlook, as well as the continued negative output

gap, the Central Bank reduced the Standing Lending

Facility Rate (SLFR), which is the upper bound of

the policy interest rate corridor of the Central Bank,

by 25 basis points on 4 April 2018. The Central

Bank continued to progress towards moving to

a Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework

by 2020. Improvements to the monetary policy

formulation processes are being institutionalised,

while capacity building with technical assistance of

the IMF continued throughout the year.

7.2 Monetary Policy Stance of the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka

During 2017, the Central Bank continued

to conduct its monetary policy within an

enhanced monetary policy framework, which

is the interim framework in the move towards

FIT by 2020, wherein inflation is to be stabilised

within a range of 4.0-6.0 per cent, thereby

creating a growth conducive macroeconomic

environment. Currently, the Central Bank primarily

uses the policy interest rates and OMOs to guide

the AWCMR, which is the operating target of the

current monetary policy framework. Broad money

continues to serve as a key indicative variable

for the conduct of monetary policy. In the move

towards FIT and to strengthen forward looking

decision-making, underpinned by reliable medium

term forecasts of key macroeconomic variables,

the Central Bank was able to successfully integrate

a Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS)

during the year, developed with the assistance

of the IMF, into the monetary policy formulation

process. Accordingly, the policy formulation

process followed an internal forecast calendar,

which outlined timelines for projections and

revisions of forecasts based on the latest domestic

and international economic developments.

Several rounds of discussions on projections and

sectoral developments amongst technical staff

MONETARY POLICY, INTEREST RATES, MONEY AND CREDIT

7

223

as well as with members of the Monetary Policy

Committee (MPC) preceded the formal meetings

of the MPC, which makes the recommendations

on the appropriate monetary policy stance to

the Monetary Board of the Central Bank. The

number of MPC meetings was reduced from 12

to 8 in 2017 to provide sufficient time for technical

staff to undertake increasingly sophisticated

macroeconomic analyses in a forward-looking

manner, considering current and future domestic

and global economic conditions. Furthermore, with

a view to obtaining the views of the private sector to

be incorporated into the monetary policy decision

making process, the Central Bank re-established

the Monetary Policy Consultative Committee

(MPCC) in 2017 as announced in the Road Map

2017: Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for

2017 and Beyond.

In spite of the tight monetary policy stance

maintained during the past two years, inflation

broadly remained higher than expected during

2017, driven by high food inflation caused by

weather related supply disruptions as well as

the effect of the tax adjustments made in 2016.

Headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year

change in both the National Consumer Price Index

(NCPI, 2013=100) and the Colombo Consumer

Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) increased during

most of 2017 with twin peaks recorded in the first

quarter and the fourth quarter. This was mainly

due to an increase in food inflation caused by

unanticipated supply side disruptions on account

of adverse weather conditions as well as the

increase in non-food inflation, led by the impact of

tax revisions to Value Added Tax (VAT) and Nation

Building Tax (NBT) and the upward movement in

international commodity prices. However, some

softening of headline inflation was observed in

certain months, reflecting the favourable base

effects and the moderation of food inflation,

partly supported by the government’s supply side

initiatives to address price escalations. Accordingly,

year-on-year headline inflation based on the NCPI,

which was at 8.6 per cent in March 2017, gradually

slowed thereafter, before reaching a peak of

8.8 per cent in October 2017. Nevertheless, the

decline in volatile food prices caused inflation to

moderate to 7.3 per cent by end 2017. Meanwhile,

year-on-year headline inflation based on the CCPI

also indicated a similar movement and peaked at

7.3 per cent in March 2017 and 7.8 per cent in

October 2017, before moderating to 7.1 per cent

by end 2017, indicating the gradual dissipation

of price pressures stemming from supply side

disruptions. The deceleration in food inflation

continued at a faster pace in early 2018 as well,

contributing favourably to the decline in headline

inflation. Accordingly, year-on-year headline

inflation based on the NCPI adjusted downwards

to 3.2 per cent in February 2018, while headline

inflation based on the CCPI receded to 4.2 per cent

in March 2018. Reflecting upward movements in

prices during 2017, on an annual average basis,

NCPI based headline inflation accelerated to 7.7

per cent by end 2017, compared to 4.0 per cent

recorded at end 2016, while CCPI based annual

average inflation accelerated to 6.6 per cent by

end 2017 from 4.0 per cent at end 2016. As per

the Inflation Expectations Survey of the Central

Bank, inflation expectations of the corporate sector

as well as the household sector remained relatively

high during the latter part of 2017, partly influenced

by the actual increase in inflation during that period.

However, inflation expectations over the period

ahead appear to have moderated in line with the

downward adjustment in recent headline inflation.

Core inflation, which is a measure of

underlying inflation, was on an upward trend in

the beginning of 2017, but declined thereafter,

mainly responding to the tight monetary policy

stance of the Central Bank. During the first quarter

of 2017, core inflation remained relatively high mainly

due to the impact of tax revisions and the increase

in prices of the non-food category. However, core

inflation declined and remained subdued in the

remainder of 2017. Accordingly, NCPI based core

inflation declined to 2.7 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2017 from 6.7 per cent at end 2016. On an

annual average basis, NCPI based core inflation

declined from 5.9 per cent at end 2016 to 4.9 per

cent by end 2017. Following a similar trend, year-on-

year core inflation based on CCPI declined to 4.3 per

cent by end 2017, compared to 5.8 per cent at end

2016. However, on an annual average basis, CCPI

based core inflation remained at 5.9 per cent by end

2017, compared to the 4.4 per cent recorded in 2016

due to the high inflation that prevailed in the early

part of the year. Core inflation remained subdued in

the first quarter of 2018. Accordingly, NCPI based

year-on-year core inflation was at 2.0 per cent in

February 2018, and CCPI based year-on-year core

inflation was at 3.4 per cent in March 2018.

Reflecting the impact of the continued tight

monetary policy stance, both the growth of

broad money supply and the growth of credit

extended to the private sector by commercial

banks decelerated towards the desired levels by

end 2017. Growth in credit extended to the private

sector by commercial banks continued to decelerate

gradually since July 2016 and reached the desired

level by end 2017, responding to the high cost of

borrowing as reflected by high nominal and real

interest rates. The slowdown in the growth of

credit disbursements helped contain the monetary

expansion that remained at elevated levels during the

last two years. The expansion in NFA of the banking

system, particularly since April 2017, along with the

reserve accumulation of the Central Bank as well

as the reduction in foreign liabilities of commercial

banks contributed to the monetary growth in 2017.

Meanwhile, increase in credit obtained by the public

sector from commercial banks also contributed to

monetary expansion in 2017.

The Central Bank actively conducted OMO

to steer the AWCMR in line with the tight

monetary policy stance. Rupee liquidity in the

domestic money market remained tight until mid

July 2017, as a result of the maturing of Treasury

bills from the Central Bank holdings and foreign

exchange sales by the Central Bank, in view of

capital outflows, particularly in the first quarter

of 2017. Accordingly, reflecting tight liquidity

conditions, the AWCMR hovered closer to the

upper bound of the standing rate corridor formed

by policy interest rates of the Central Bank.

However, liquidity conditions in the money market

turned positive since mid July 2017, as a result

of continued foreign exchange purchases by the

Central Bank and part conversions of proceeds of

the International Sovereign Bond (ISB) and foreign

loans received by the government. Liquidity surplus

resulted in a moderation of interest rates, and

the AWCMR gradually adjusted downwards from

the upper bound of the policy rate corridor. With

a view to maintaining the overnight interest rates

at the desired levels, the Central Bank actively

conducted OMO by absorbing excess liquidity

on an overnight, short term and long term basis

and was able to stabilise the AWCMR around the

middle of the corridor since August 2017.

The Central Bank continued to improve

communication with its key stakeholders to

effectively convey the rationale and expected

outcomes of monetary policy decisions

and other regulatory measures abreast with

its increased focus on transparency and

accountability. Managing expectations, primarily

of inflation, and building awareness among

the general public and other key stakeholders

have been at the forefront of the Central Bank’s

communication policy. At the beginning of the year,

the Central Bank announced its strategies and

policies for 2017 and the medium term through its

Road Map 2017, with a view to providing broad

guidance on policies to all stakeholders of the

economy. The Central Bank continued to pursue

an active communication policy through press

releases and press conferences, meetings and

discussions, and public lectures and seminars,

regularly and promptly. The periodic monetary

policy review process was continued with a press

conference, chaired by the Governor and attended

by senior officers of the Central Bank. While

updates on key macroeconomic developments and

policy measures were publicised via regular press

releases and other communiqués, the flagship

publications of the Central Bank, namely the Annual

Report and the Recent Economic Developments,

presented detailed and comprehensive analyses

of the same for public information in all three

languages. In addition, the Central Bank continued

to effectively disseminate macroeconomic data on

a daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly basis through

its website and other modes of communication.

7.3 Movements of Interest Rates

Market Liquidity, Market Operations and Short Term Interest Rates

Rupee liquidity in the domestic money

market remained broadly in deficit during the

first seven months of the year before improving

to surplus levels, on average, during the latter

part of the year. Money market liquidity was at

surplus levels at the beginning of the year and

remained in surplus until early February 2017,

mainly due to the return of currency into the banking

system after being utilised during the festive

season, the release of provisional advances to the

government as well as maturing term repurchase

agreements of market participants with the Central

Bank. However, excess liquidity declined thereafter

and market liquidity remained negative until mid

July 2017, due to the maturing of Treasury bills

from the holdings of the Central Bank and net

foreign exchange sales by the Central Bank, in

view of capital outflows in the first quarter of 2017.

Rupee liquidity recorded the highest deficit of Rs.

51.1 billion on 30 June 2017. Subsequently, the

liquidity level increased to surplus levels until the

end of 2017 mainly due to the continuous purchase

of foreign exchange by the Central Bank and the

conversion of part of the proceeds of the ISB

obtained by the government. Hence, liquidity in the

domestic money market was in excess of Rs. 24.4

billion, on average, during the second half of the

year.

In response to the tight monetary policy

stance and deficit levels of liquidity, overnight

money market rates gradually adjusted upwards

and hovered around the upper bound of the

standing rate corridor till mid July 2017 and

declined thereafter to stabilise in the middle of

the corridor since September 2017, in line with

improved liquidity conditions and effective

OMO. The AWCMR reached the upper bound of the

standing rate corridor in February 2017 and hovered

at these levels until mid July 2017, as market

liquidity levels remained in the negative territory.

Introduction

The term “liquidity” has several meanings and connotations, depending on the context within which it is being used. Accordingly, market liquidity1 of any asset refers to the combination of the degree of ease with which it can be sold (or bought) in a timely manner and the level of costs associated with the transaction, either in terms of transactions costs or the acceptance of a lower price in order to find a buyer in a reasonable time. Funding liquidity denotes the ability to fund increases in assets and meet cash flow obligations as they fall due. Economic liquidity2 refers to the volume of broad money supply available to fulfill the payment needs of the economy. Monetary liquidity3 is defined as a subset of the domestic currency denominated non-interest bearing liabilities of a central bank that is held by the non-state sector, i.e., base money or reserve money. Liquidity in the interbank market is defined as the sum of the clearing balances of participatory banks held with the central bank.

There are several reasons underpinning a central bank’s concern regarding interbank liquidity. One key reason is that it is the liquidity measure that is used by a central bank to steer the average interest rate in the interbank short term money market (in Sri Lanka, this is known as the Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which is the operating target in the current enhanced monetary policy framework), so that it remains at a desirable level. Hence, either the absorption or injection of liquidity to the market will provide the central bank the ability to control the cost of funds of commercial banks, and thereby enable the regulation of credit flows to the economy. For instance, in the event of a liquidity deficit, the central banks would supply liquidity to meet the requirements of the market and thereby strive to minimise undue fluctuations in market interest rates. This will also ensure the smooth operation of payment systems, which would otherwise be hindered by the insufficiency of funds. Hence, close surveillance and timely actions to ensure the presence of healthy levels of liquidity would play a key role in ensuring financial system stability. On the other hand, the immediate consequence of a liquidity surplus, that remains unabsorbed by the central bank, is a decline in short-term interest rates, possibly to levels within the proximity of zero per cent. Under such circumstances, commercial banks may resort to risky lending in search of higher yields or they may refuse

BOX 08Management of Structural Liquidity: The Way Forward

to accept customer deposits. Further, such behaviour of commercial banks can create inflationary pressures through possible increases in consumption in the economy. Such developments in short term interest rates can also negatively impact the exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves. Some central banks have also observed that a large structural liquidity surplus in the market results in the weakening of the “interest rate channel” of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In essence, therefore, liquidity management plays an important role in both monetary and financial stability policies.

Since neither a large deficit nor a surplus of liquidity is desirable, this gives rise to the policy question of the optimal level of liquidity for an economy. Policymakers recognise that while it is difficult to estimate an optimal liquidity level due to the dynamic nature of this measure, there is a general consensus that the prevalence of a liquidity deficit is preferred over its surplus counterpart as it provides a central bank with greater leeway for the management of short term interest rates and thereby supporting the effective conduct of monetary policy to ensure macroeconomic stability.

Interbank Liquidity

Interbank liquidity in the context of Sri Lanka is defined as the total deposits held by banks in the current accounts maintained by licensed commercial banks (LCBs) with the Central Bank. Under Section 83 of the Monetary Law Act of 1949, LCBs are required to maintain a portion of their rupee deposit liabilities as statutory reserve requirement in their current accounts with the Central Bank, based on the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) determined by the Central Bank. As the current SRR is 7.5 per cent, this denotes that for every Rs. 100 worth of rupee deposits accepted, a LCB has to deposit Rs. 7.50 in a non-interest bearing account with the Central Bank. Therefore, any excess or deficit in the LCB’s account with the Central Bank that is above or below the statutorily required level is termed as either excess liquidity or deficit liquidity, respectively. If the required reserve level on a given day is Rs. 100 million and the actual balance in the LCB’s account with the Central Bank is Rs.110 million, then the amount over the required liquidity of Rs.10 million, is considered excess liquidity. A liquidity deficit of Rs. 5 million would be recorded with an account balance of Rs. 95 million.

There are two main factors that can induce changes in the level of liquidity in the interbank market, i.e., monetary policy actions and autonomous or

exogenous factors. Such monetary policy actions comprise Open Market Operations (OMO) such as repo/reverse repo auctions, outright auctions and the Standing Facilities of the Central Bank. Autonomous factors comprise variables such as demand for currency in circulation, foreign currency purchases by the Central Bank, and government borrowing from the Central Bank. Hence, such factors are exogenous to activities that are influenced to a great extent by parties other than the Central Bank, such as the public, banks and the government. Any decrease in demand for currency by the public or an increase in purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank or an increase in credit from the Central Bank to the government would result in an increase in structural liquidity and vice versa. However, it should be noted that the impact of such developments may be fully or partially offset by an opposite change in any other factor, leaving the level of liquidity unchanged.

Structural Liquidity and Autonomous Factors

Structural liquidity is defined as the total amount of liquidity in the interbank market prior to a monetary policy action that entails the supply or drain of reserves from the banking system. In other words, structural liquidity comprises the level of reserves that are determined by autonomous factors4. Chart B 8.1 shows movements in total structural liquidity and the structural liquidity excess or deficit that was prevalent in the market in the recent past.

Structural Excess LiquidityRequired Reserves

One of the major factors contributing to changes in structural liquidity in Sri Lanka is credit granted to the government by the Central Bank, under the provisions of the MLA, as provisional advances and through subscription to Treasury bills at primary auctions. While credit provided under provisional advances

has led to a permanent increase in structural liquidity, funds that are disbursed to the government through the Central Bank purchases of Treasury bills results in only a temporary increase in structural liquidity. These differences are illustrated in Chart B 8.2, where the increasing trend in credit to government over time is due to provisional advances while short terms variations are due to the changes in Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank. Credit granted to the government as provisional advances by the Central Bank (10 per cent of the estimated government revenue in a financial year) leads to a permanent increase in structural liquidity as they have been accumulating over several years as it is essentially an ‘overdraft facility,’ which can be drawn down without being fully settled. However, credit granted by way of issuance of Treasury bills are of a temporary nature as they are settled fully upon maturity or when sold by the Central Bank in the secondary market.

An equally significant autonomous factor that causes sudden and sharp changes in structural liquidity is the net foreign currency purchases by the Central Bank. Net foreign currency purchases by the Central Bank are largely driven by two key factors, i.e., intervention by the Central Bank in the foreign exchange market to smooth volatilities in the exchange rate and the level of foreign exchange reserves that the Central Bank aims to maintain. Purchases by the Central Bank of proceeds of foreign inflows to the government, including International Sovereign Bond (ISB) issuances have also been a key driver of infrequent but substantial changes in structural liquidity during the past several years. For example, the main reason for the increase in excess liquidity in 2014 was the purchase of the proceeds by the Central Bank of such an ISB (See Chart B 8.3)4.

Demand for notes and coins by the public is another autonomous factor related to structural liquidity. Changes in currency demand are seasonal and sharp, but are short lived with a substantial portion of the currency withdrawals experiencing a reversal within a month, as there is an opportunity cost of holding currency, which is the foregone interest earnings. Notably, these sharp fluctuations in currency in circulation are of a seasonal nature as these are around the Sinhala and Tamil New Year festival, and to a lesser extent during the Christmas season. Furthermore, over time, increases in per capita income increase the demand for currency by the public resulting in draining of liquidity (Chart B 8.4) on a permanent basis.

Managing Structural liquidity

Globally, central banks use a variety of conventional and non-conventional tools for the management of structural liquidity. Some such temporary tools are repo/reverse repo auctions, the acceptance of deposits and foreign

exchange swaps with different tenors and different collateral. Purchase and sale of different assets such as government securities, foreign exchange, corporate securities, equity and book loans are deployed to create permanent changes in structural liquidity, depending on the requirement at the time.

The Central Bank also employs OMO tools to either inject or absorb liquidity on a permanent or temporary basis. Permanent changes in liquidity can be brought about by changes to SRR, which is considered to be a non-market based monetary policy instrument. Instruments such as OMO repo or reverse repo auctions or the issuance of Central Bank securities are aimed at the absorption or injection of liquidity on a temporary basis while OMO outright auctions are carried out to permanently absorb or inject liquidity. It is only liquid asset such as Treasury bills or foreign exchange that can be deployed to induce permanent changes in structural liquidity at any given point of time. From a monetary policy perspective, there is no material difference in using Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank, issuing Central Bank securities, or using borrowed securities for the absorption of liquidity on a temporary basis. What differs is the cost associated with such operations, as the cost of each instrument is primarily dependent on its liquidity and the tax treatment involved.

Way Forward

Current provisions in the MLA are rather restrictive in the conduct of OMO because OMO are confined to the purchase or sale of short term government securities (Treasury bills) in the open market and the issuance of Central Bank Securities. Furthermore, MLA provisions relating to the grant of credit to the government is another means of injecting structural liquidity to the system, wherein it could render significant difficulties to the effective conduct of monetary policy, especially under a flexible inflation targeting regime.

Modern central banks with inflation targeting monetary policy frameworks possess greater flexibility with regard to the conduct of OMO as they have at their disposal a comprehensive, expanded tool kit comprising several conventional or non-conventional instruments for the absorption or injection of liquidity for the effective conduct of monetary policy. The provision of credit to the government by these central banks is also reduced or restricted by statute due to the adverse impact of such arrangements on structural liquidity and on demand driven inflation. It is expected that envisaged modifications to monetary management under the proposed flexible inflation targeting framework would enable the Central Bank to manage market liquidity more effectively and actively, thereby steering the overnight interest rates consistent with the desired inflation path.

Accordingly, during the period from mid February

to mid July 2017, the Central Bank mostly

conducted overnight reverse repurchase auctions

in order to inject liquidity into the domestic

money market to maintain interest rate stability.

However, liquidity conditions in the money market

turned positive since mid July 2017 and as a

result overnight interest rates started to adjust

downwards. With the support of OMO conducted

by the Central Bank to stabilise interest rates, the

AWCMR declined gradually thereafter from 8.75

per cent towards the middle of the standing rate

corridor by end September 2017. The AWCMR

continued to remain at around the same level of

8.15 per cent until the year end. Meanwhile, Sri

Lanka Inter Bank Offered Rates (SLIBOR) also

moved downwards during the year, in line with the

movements in the AWCMR and market liquidity

conditions. Accordingly, by end 2017, the overnight

and 3-month SLIBOR stood at 8.15 per cent and

10.05 per cent, respectively, compared to 8.44 per

cent and 11.01 per cent, respectively, reported at

end 2016. However, SLIBOR for longer tenors,

which are mostly inactive, moved slightly upwards

during the year. With improvements in market

liquidity, the Central Bank conducted overnight

repurchase auctions to absorb the excess, thereby

steering overnight interest rates to be in line with

the monetary policy stance. Reflecting these

movements, weighted average yields at OMO

repurchase auctions decreased to 7.25 per cent by

end 2017, from 7.43 per cent at end 2016.

Yields on Government Securities

Yields on government securities declined

substantially during the second half of 2017,

correcting a significant gap that existed between

the policy rates and the yields, along with the

modifications to the Treasury bond auction

system and favourable market sentiments,

supported by the availability of foreign financing

to the government. Reflecting the increased

borrowing requirement of the government, the

move to a purely auction based system for issuing

government securities from early 2015 and the tight

monetary conditions that prevailed in the economy,

yields on Treasury bills in the primary market showed

upward movements during the first four months of

2017. Accordingly, by end April 2017, yields on 91-

day, 182-day and 364-day Treasury bills increased

by 101 basis points, 107 basis points and 85 basis

points, respectively, compared to the yields that

prevailed at end 2016. Thereafter, yield rates adjusted

downwards, indicating a correction of the excessive

increase in yields from early 2015, supported by the

excess liquidity in the domestic market, increased

government revenue and favourable market

sentiments due to the continuation of the IMF-

EFF programme. In addition, the pressure in the

government securities market reduced substantially

since March 2017 in view of increased foreign inflows

to the government securities market as well as the

receipt of the proceeds of the ISB amounting to US

dollars 1.5 billion, the syndicated loan proceeds

totalling US dollar 1.0 billion and the proceeds of the

divestment of Hambantota port amounting US dollars

292.1 million. Accordingly, yields on 91-day, 182-day

and 364-day Treasury bills in the primary market

decreased by 204, 249 and 221 basis points to 7.69

per cent, 8.30 per cent and 8.90 per cent, respectively,

by end December 2017, compared to the peak yield

levels recorded in April 2017.

Primary market yields on Treasury bonds

up to 10-year maturities exhibited a downward

trend in 2017, while Treasury bonds with more

than 10-year maturities were not issued, given

the high market interest rates. Similar to the

yields on Treasury bills in the primary market,

yields on Treasury bonds also increased during the

first quarter of 2017 in view of the high borrowing

requirement of the government. The yields on

5-year Treasury bonds increased from 12.16

per cent since early January 2017 and reached its

peak of 12.89 per cent by February 2017 before

moderating to 10.20 per cent by end 2017. Similar

movements were observed in the yields pertaining

to Treasury bonds of other maturities as well. The

highest yield of 13.14 per cent was recorded in

March 2017 for Treasury bonds with a maturity

of 7-years. The issuance of foreign currency

denominated debt securities, such as Sri Lanka

Development Bonds (SLDBs) and ISBs, helped

ease the pressure on yields of domestic debt

instruments in the second half of 2017 to a certain

extent. This was reinforced by the introduction of a

new primary issuance system for Treasury bonds by

the Central Bank since end July 2017, to increase

the efficiency and transparency of domestic

borrowings of the government. Meanwhile, in

order to improve investment planning as well as

consistency and predictability of the government

borrowing programme, a quarterly Treasury bond

advance auction calendar was published. These

improvements to the auction process also helped

ease pressure on yield rates on Treasury bonds

during the second half of 2017.

The secondary market yield curve for

government securities shifted downwards

and remained relatively flat in 2017. Compared

to the short end of the yield curve, a sharp

downward movement was observed in the longer

end of the yield curve. Narrowing down in the

term premium was facilitated by improvements in

investor sentiment as well as anchored inflation

expectations. Accordingly, yields on Treasury bills

in respect of all three maturities in the secondary

market decreased by 101 to 130 basis points to

a range of 7.68 to 8.89 per cent by end 2017 in

comparison to yields that prevailed at end 2016. A

similar movement was observed in Treasury bond

yields of all maturities as well, although the decline

was higher than that of Treasury bills. Accordingly,

the yields on Treasury bonds of all maturities

in the secondary market were in a range of

9.37 per cent to 10.68 per cent by end 2017.

Deposit and Lending Interest Rates

Reflecting tight monetary conditions,

deposit interest rates of commercial banks

continued to increase during 2017, although

some moderation was observed towards the

end of the year. The average weighted deposit

rate (AWDR), which reflects the movements in

interest rate of all outstanding interest bearing

deposits held with commercial banks, increased by

108 basis points to a peak of 9.25 per cent by end

September 2017 from 8.17 per cent at end 2016.

Similarly, the average weighted fixed deposit rate

(AWFDR), which is based on interest rates of all

outstanding time deposits held with commercial

banks, also increased by 135 basis points to a peak

of 11.81 per cent by end September 2017 from

10.46 per cent at end 2016. However, following

the downward movements in short term interest

rates, particularly yields on short term government

securities with improved liquidity in the market, both

AWDR and AWFDR moved downwards gradually

since October 2017 and reached 9.07 per cent and

11.48 per cent, respectively, by end 2017, while

remaining higher than the interest rates recorded at

end 2016. Accordingly, the increase in AWDR and

AWFDR was 90 basis points and 102 basis points,

respectively, from end 2016 to end 2017. Moreover,

as reflected in the movements in the AWFDR, a

substantial increase in interest rates was observed,

particularly for 1-year and 2-year time deposits

during 2017. Meanwhile, the average weighted

new deposit rate (AWNDR), which captures the

interest rates of all new interest bearing deposits

during a month, increased by 55 basis points to

a peak of 11.72 per cent by end July 2017, from

11.17 per cent at end December 2016. However,

following the declining trend in other short term

interest rates, AWNDR declined from August 2017,

reaching 10.06 per cent by end 2017.

The Legal rate and the Market rate of

interest,1 as determined by the Monetary Board

and published in the Government Gazette at

the end of each year, were 9.08 per cent per

annum for 2018 compared to 7.06 per cent per

annum for 2017. These rates were computed in

December of each year based on simple averages

of monthly AWDR of all commercial banks during

the preceding twelve months and are applicable for

the following year.

Lending rates of commercial banks

continued to increase in 2017, reflecting tight

monetary conditions, and stabilised at elevated

levels towards the end of the year. The average

weighted lending rate (AWLR), which is based on

interest rates of all outstanding rupee denominated

loans and advances extended by Licensed

Commercial Banks (LCBs) to the private sector,

increased by 68 basis points to 13.88 per cent by

end 2017 from 13.20 per cent at end 2016. Bank-

wise AWLR also increased to a range of 10.22 -

16.23 per cent by end 2017 compared to the range

of 10.12 - 15.66 per cent that prevailed at end 2016.

Moreover, lending rates against most types of

securities also increased during 2017. In particular,

interest rates on loans and advances secured by

Gold and Other Precious Metals under Pawning,

Leasing and Hire Purchase Agreements as well

as Fixed, Savings and Other Deposits increased

considerably during the year. The interest rate

spread between AWDR and AWLR declined during

2017 compared to levels seen in 2016, although

a marginal increase was observed towards the

end of the year with the downward movement in

deposit rates. Further, the average weighted new

lending rate (AWNLR), which captures interest

rates of all new loans and advances extended by

commercial banks to the private sector during a

month, increased by 75 basis points to a peak of

15.12 per cent by end August 2017 compared to

14.37 per cent at end December 2016. However,

in line with the movements in short term interest

rates, the AWNLR declined gradually thereafter

recording at 14.31 per cent by end December 2017.

The spread between AWNDR and AWNLR showed

an increasing trend during 2017, particularly

towards the end of the year, as the decline in

the AWNDR was higher than the decline in the

AWNLR. Meanwhile, the weekly average weighted

prime lending rate (AWPR), which is based on

interest rates applicable on short term loans and

advances granted by commercial banks to their

prime customers during a week, increased by 74

basis points to a peak of 12.26 per cent by end July

2017 from 11.52 per cent at end 2016. However,

given improved market liquidity levels, the weekly

AWPR also moved downwards to reach 11.55 per

cent by end 2017, while monthly AWPR, which is

the monthly average of weekly AWPR, reached

11.33 per cent by end 2017, decreasing by 40 basis

points, compared to the rates at end 2016.

Interest Rates on Debt Instruments

Interest rates applicable on corporate debt

securities also remained high during 2017.

Interest rates on commercial paper, which is a

short term debt instrument, increased to a range

of 13.75 - 16.50 per cent during 2017, compared

to the range of 8.70 - 14.80 per cent reported for

2016. Meanwhile, thirteen new listings of corporate

debentures were reported by six corporates in

2017 with maturities of 2 to 8 years. Most of these

debentures were issued with fixed interest rates,

while a few were issued on the basis of floating

rates. Fixed interest rates applicable on those

debentures were in the range of 12.50 - 15.00 per

cent in 2017, compared to the range of 9.60 - 13.75

per cent witnessed in 2016.

Interest Rates on Foreign Currency Deposits

Interest rates applicable on foreign

currency denominated deposits maintained

with commercial banks increased marginally

during 2017, reflecting the gradual rise in

global interest rates. Following the increases

in the Federal Funds target rate in the US during

2017, interest rates offered by commercial banks

on US dollar denominated savings deposits were

recorded in a range of 0.02 - 4.38 per cent by end

2017 compared to the range of 0.02 - 3.62 per cent

reported at end 2016. Interest rates pertaining to

US dollar denominated time deposits remained

broadly unchanged in a range of 0.15 - 5.03 per

cent by end 2017 compared to the range of 0.15

- 5.00 per cent at end 2016. Meanwhile, following

the policy rate increases by the Bank of England in

November 2017, interest rates on savings deposits

denominated in pound sterling also increased to

a range of 0.10 - 2.25 per cent by end 2017 in

comparison to the range of 0.05 - 2.01 per cent

recorded at end 2016. Interest rates applicable on

pound sterling denominated time deposits were

in a range of 0.20 - 4.57 per cent by end 2017,

whereas the comparable rates were 0.25 - 4.02 per

cent at end 2016.

7.4 Movements of Monetary and

Credit Aggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money expanded moderately during

2017 mainly due to the impact arising from the

high base observed in 2016, on account of the

upward adjustment to SRR in January 2016.

Accordingly, on a year-on-year basis, reserve money

growth decelerated to 9.8 per cent by end 2017,

from a high growth of 27.1 per cent recorded at end

2016. In absolute terms, reserve money expanded

939.8 billion by the end of the year, compared to

the notable expansion of Rs. 182.7 billion in 2016.

With regard to the liability side of reserve money,

both currency in circulation and commercial banks’

deposits with the Central Bank contributed to the

increase in reserve money in 2017. Reflecting the

increased opportunity cost of holding money in an

environment of high market interest rates, currency

in circulation increased at a lower rate of 8.2 per

cent, year-on-year, by end 2017, compared to a

growth of 12.4 per cent by end 2016. In absolute

terms, currency in circulation increased by Rs. 45.3

billion to Rs. 598.1 billion by end 2017, compared

to the increase of Rs. 61.1 billion reported during

2016. Meanwhile, in 2017, commercial banks’

deposits with the Central Bank increased by Rs.

38.5 billion to Rs. 341.7 billion compared to the

significant increase of Rs. 121.5 billion in 2016

resulting from the upward adjustment to SRR. The

year-on-year growth of commercial banks’ deposits

was 12.7 per cent by end 2017, in comparison to

the growth of 66.9 per cent at end 2016. With these

developments, by the end of 2017, reserve money

remained well below the target agreed with the IMF

under the EFF programme.

Based on the assets side of the Central

Bank balance sheet, the expansion in reserve

money during 2017 was entirely driven by

the increase in NFA of the Central Bank. In

contrast to the developments in 2016 where

reserve money expansion was driven entirely by

the increase in Net Domestic Assets (NDA), NFA

of the Central Bank increased substantially by

Rs. 287.5 billion to Rs. 846.1 billion in 2017,

compared to the decline of Rs. 17.6 billion in

2016. This was mainly as a result of the increase

in reserve assets of the Central Bank in terms of

investments in foreign securities and increase in

cash and balances abroad held by the Central

Bank, following the net foreign exchange

purchases by the Central Bank from the domestic

foreign exchange market as well as the receipt of

the proceeds of the ISB issuance and syndicated

loans obtained by the government during the

year. Contributing to a further increase in NFA of

the Central Bank, foreign financial liabilities of the

Central Bank declined by Rs. 8.9 billion during

2017 due to a decrease in liabilities to foreign

central banks and international organisations,

along with the completion of repayment under

the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) Facility of the

IMF. Nevertheless, the Central Bank’s financial

liabilities in terms of liabilities to the Asian

Clearing Union (ACU) and liabilities under the

IMF-EFF increased during the period under

review. In contrast to the increase in NFA, NDA

of the Central Bank declined considerably by

Rs. 203.9 billion to Rs. 93.7 billion during 2017,

as against an increase of Rs. 200.3 billion in

2016. The sharp decline in NDA reflected the

contraction in net credit to the government

(NCG) by the Central Bank. In view of the

Central Bank’s actions to unwind its Treasury

bill holdings, NCG by the Central Bank declined

significantly by Rs. 187.9 billion to Rs. 225.1

billion during 2017, in contrast to the increase of

Rs. 183.1 billion reported during 2016. With the

maturing of Treasury bills by the Central Bank

and the outright sales of Treasury bills by the

Central Bank to absorb excess rupee liquidity

from the domestic market on a permanent basis

since mid July 2017, Treasury bill holdings (net

of repurchase transactions) of the Central Bank

declined by Rs. 304.5 billion to Rs. 25.6 billion

by end 2017, compared to the historically highest

level of Rs. 330.0 billion recorded at end 2016.

However, within NCG, provisional advances

extended to the government by the Central Bank

increased by Rs. 120.4 billion to Rs. 203.7 billion

in January 2017, from Rs. 83.3 billion at end 2016,

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

with the full utilisation of the amount entitled

under the Monetary Law Act (MLA) for 2017.

The sharp increase in provisional advances in

January 2017 was mainly due to the settlement

of provisional advances by the government in

December 2016, using funds raised through the

issuance of Treasury bills worth Rs. 100 billion to

the Central Bank during the month and utilisation

of total amount of advances in January 2017. By

end 2017, the outstanding amount of provisional

advances extended to the government by

the Central Bank recorded Rs. 199.8 billion.

Moreover, contributing to the decline in NDA,

other items (net) of the Central Bank, which is

the difference between other assets and other

liabilities of the Central Bank, declined by

Rs. 21.0 billion during 2017 mainly on account of

an increase in retained earnings.

The money multiplier, which links reserve

money and broad money (M2b), increased to 6.71

by end 2017 from 6.31 recorded at end 2016, mainly

due to the gradual decrease in the currency to

deposit ratio in an environment of high market

interest rates. The currency to deposit ratio declined to

7.5 per cent by end 2017 from 8.6 per cent and 9.3 per

cent recorded at end 2016 and end 2015, respectively.

On average, the money multiplier increased to 6.63

during 2017, compared to 6.38 in 2016.

Narrow Money (M1)

Reflecting the impact of the high interest

rate environment, the year-on-year growth

of narrow money (M1) moderated further

during 2017. M1, which comprises currency and

demand deposits held by the public, recorded

a lower year-on-year growth of 2.1 per cent by

end 2017 in comparison to a 8.6 per cent growth

witnessed at end 2016. Currency held by the

public increased by 2.3 per cent, year-on-year,

to Rs. 439.4 billion by end 2017, in comparison to

a 10.7 per cent growth at end 2016, contributing

to around 59 per cent of the total expansion

in narrow money during the year. Meanwhile,

in view of the high interest rate environment,

demand deposits held by the public with

commercial banks grew at a slower rate of 2.0

per cent, year-on-year, by end 2017, compared

to the growth of 6.2 per cent reported at end

2016. In absolute terms, demand deposits held

by the public with commercial banks increased

only by Rs. 6.8 billion, reaching Rs. 353.9 billion

by end 2017, in comparison to the increase of

Rs. 20.2 billion in 2016.

Broad Money (M2b) and Domestic Credit

Broad money growth (M2b), which remained

high during most of 2017, gradually decelerated

towards the latter part of the year on account of

declining domestic credit growth. The year-on-

year growth of M2b peaked at 21.4 per cent in May

2017, compared to a growth of 18.4 per cent at end

2016, and decelerated gradually thereafter to 16.7

per cent by end 2017, as expected. Meanwhile,

average broad money growth was 19.6 per cent

in 2017, compared to 18.1 per cent in 2016.

Monetary growth during 2017 was attributable to

the expansion in both NDA and NFA of the banking

system. NDA contributed to around 61 per cent

of the year-on-year expansion of broad money in

2017, compared to its significant contribution of 92

per cent recorded in 2016, indicating a slowdown of

the expansion in domestic credit flows. Meanwhile,

the build-up of NFA since April 2017, along with the

reserve accumulation of the Central Bank as well

as the improvements in the net position of financial

assets of commercial banks contributed to increase

the relative share of monetary growth.

On the liability side of M2b, the increase in

time and savings deposits held by the public

with commercial banks largely contributed to the

monetary expansion during 2017. With high interest

rates in the market, time and savings deposits held

by the public grew by 19.1 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2017, compared to the growth of 20.2 per cent

recorded at end 2016, thus contributing to around 98

per cent of the expansion of M2b. Accordingly, compared

to the increase of Rs. 778.0 billion in 2016, time and

savings deposits held by the public with commercial

banks increased by Rs. 885.8 billion in 2017 to record

a total interest bearing deposit base of Rs. 5.5 trillion.

Meanwhile, demand deposits held by the public with

commercial banks grew by 2.0 per cent, year-on-year,

in 2017 in comparison to 6.2 per cent in 2016.

Contributing to the expansion of M2b, on

the assets side, NFA of the banking sector

increased substantially in 2017, turning the

outstanding amount of NFA to positive levels.

The overall NFA position of the banking system,

which remained in the negative territory since

December 2014, turned positive from September

2017, reflecting improvements in NFA of both the

Central Bank and the commercial banking sector.

Accordingly, the overall NFA of the banking sector

expanded significantly by Rs. 352.8 billion in

2017 in comparison to the moderate increase of

Rs. 66.9 billion in 2016. Accounting for around 82

per cent of the increase in overall NFA position, NFA

of the Central Bank expanded by Rs. 287.5 billion,

mainly due to the increase in reserve assets of the

Central Bank with its continued foreign exchange

purchases from the market. Further, supporting the

improvement in NFA of the Central Bank, foreign

financial liabilities of the Central Bank recorded a

decline in 2017. Meanwhile, NFA of commercial

banks increased by Rs. 65.2 billion with the decline

in foreign borrowings by commercial banks during

the period under review. NFA of Domestic Banking

Units (DBUs) increased by Rs. 34.9 billion, mainly

on account of the considerable decline in foreign

borrowings together with the increase in foreign

currency placements with banks abroad, despite

the increase in foreign currency deposit liabilities of

non-residents held with commercial banks during

the year. In the meantime, NFA of Offshore Banking

Units (OBUs) also increased in 2017 entirely driven

by the decline in financial liabilities of the OBUs.

The expansion in NDA of the banking sector

continued at a slower pace during 2017. In

absolute terms, the increase in NDA of the banking

system was limited to Rs. 549.7 billion in 2017 mainly

on account of the slowdown in disbursements in

domestic credit observed during the second half of

the year. In comparison, the increase in NDA was

high at Rs. 1,003.4 billion and Rs. 772.8 billion in 2015

and 2016, respectively. The moderate expansion

in NDA during 2017 was mainly attributable to the

slowdown observed in credit disbursements to both

the government and the private sector, along with

a negative impact stemming from increased other

liabilities of commercial banks, particularly on account

of increased capital funds of commercial banks.

Within NDA, NCG by the banking system

continued to increase in 2017, albeit at a slower

pace than in 2016. During the year, NCG by the

banking sector increased by Rs. 196.4 billion

compared to the increase of Rs. 212.6 billion in 2016,

reflecting the slowdown observed during the second

half of the year. The increase in NCG was driven

entirely by the significant expansion in NCG from

commercial banks, while NCG from the Central Bank

contracted considerably during the period under

review. Accordingly, indicating a compositional shift

in bank borrowings of the government, NCG from

commercial banks increased by Rs. 384.3 billion in

2017 in comparison to the moderate increase of Rs.

29.6 billion in 2016. Contributing to the expansion

in NCG from commercial banks, NCG by DBUs

increased substantially by Rs. 322.1 billion in 2017,

compared to the increase of Rs. 96.6 billion in

2016, largely on account of investments in Treasury

bills and Treasury bonds amounting to Rs. 245.2

billion. Moreover, government overdraft balances

with commercial banks also increased by Rs. 50.4

billion, while investments in SLDBs increased by

Rs. 40.8 billion during the period under review.

Meanwhile, in 2017, NCG by OBUs of commercial

banks increased by Rs. 62.2 billion in comparison

to the decline of Rs. 67.1 billion recorded in 2016.

This was largely due to the increase in investments

in SLDBs, amounting to Rs. 23.3 billion, and the

increase in direct foreign currency loans to the

government, amounting to Rs. 38.9 billion, during

the year. Meanwhile, reflecting the government’s

lower reliance on the Central Bank for financing,

coupled with the Central Bank’s decision to unwind

its Treasury bill holdings and to refrain from

purchasing Treasury bills at primary auctions, NCG

from the Central Bank decreased considerably by

Rs. 187.9 billion in 2017, compared to the increase

of Rs. 183.1 billion in 2016.

Reflecting the increased borrowing

requirements of several state owned business

enterprises (SOBEs), credit granted to public

corporations by commercial banks increased

in 2017 although there were repayments by key

SOBEs. Continuing the increasing trend observed

since September 2016, credit to public corporations

recorded a cumulative increase of Rs. 66.6 billion

during the first five months of 2017 mainly on

account of borrowings by the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) amounting to Rs. 41.0 billion.

Nevertheless, reversing this trend, credit obtained

by public corporations declined during the period

between June to October before picking up again

towards the latter part of 2017. Subsequently,

credit to SOBEs recorded a cumulative increase of

Rs. 19.2 billion during 2017 as against a decline of

Rs. 27.9 billion in 2016. Contributing to this increase,

credit obtained by Road Development Authority

(RDA), National Water Supply and Drainage Board

and SriLankan Airlines increased by Rs. 19.0 billion,

Rs. 18.6 billion and Rs. 7.7 billion, respectively,

during the year. Borrowings by several other public

corporations including Co-operative Wholesale

Establishment (CWE) and Sri Lanka Ports Authority

also increased during the period under review.

Meanwhile, CPC settled around Rs. 15.5 billion

of its outstanding foreign currency liabilities to

commercial banks in 2017, utilising balances in its

rupee deposits with commercial banks. Moreover,

during 2017, Ceylon Fertilizer Company Ltd, Urban

Development Authority and Ceylon Electricity Board

(CEB) also made partial repayments amounting to

around Rs. 5.2 billion, Rs. 5.8 billion and Rs. 3.8

billion, respectively.

The expansion in credit extended to the

private sector by commercial banks continued

to decelerate in 2017 and reached desired

levels by the end of the year. The economy’s

response to the tight monetary policy stance

maintained by the Central Bank leading to high

market interest rates, as well as macroprudential

measures and tariff adjustments to discourage

selected imports, contributed towards lowering

credit growth in 2017. Moreover, the removal of

interest rate caps on credit cards, other loans and

advances as well as penal interest rates charged

on overdue loans and advances by licensed

banks with effect from July 2017 may also have

contributed to discourage private sector demand

for credit to some extent. Accordingly, the year-

on-year growth of credit to the private sector was

14.7 per cent by end 2017, in comparison to 21.9

per cent at end 2016, while the average growth of

credit to the private sector recorded a lower growth

of 18.3 per cent in 2017 in comparison to 25.9 per

cent in 2016. In absolute terms, the expansion in

credit extended to the private sector was limited to

Rs. 617.4 billion during 2017 compared to the

increase of Rs. 754.9 billion in 2016. As per the

security wise analysis of advances, the cumulative

increase in credit against Immovable Property, Plant

and Machinery as well as Personal Guarantees

and Promissory Notes accounted for around 62

per cent to the overall expansion in advances

during the year. Meanwhile, the growth of credit in

terms of Leasing and Hire Purchase Agreements

decelerated to 8.3 per cent by end 2017 from 12.7

per cent in 2016, indicating the impact of higher

interest rates and macroprudential policy measures

adopted to curtail imports of vehicles during the

period under review.

As per the Quarterly Survey of Commercial

Banks’ Loans and Advances to the Private

Sector, credit disbursed to all major sectors

of the economy displayed a declining trend

during 2017, except for Personal Loans and

Advances. On a year-on-year basis, credit flows

to the Services and Industry sectors expanded

by 8.3 per cent and 19.6 per cent, respectively,

during 2017, compared to the growth rates of 35.4

per cent and 22.2 per cent, respectively, recorded

for 2016. Contributing to the slowdown in credit to

and Freight Forwarding subsectors declined during

2017. The slowdown observed in credit disbursed

to Financial and Business Services was mainly due

to slower growth in credit to leasing companies by

the banking sector during the year. Nevertheless,

credit flows to other subsectors, particularly,

Tourism, Printing and Publishing, Education,

Health, Wholesale and Retail Trade, and Transport

recorded positive growth during 2017. Within the

Industry sector, the Construction subsector, which

accounted for around 49 per cent of total loans

disbursed to the Industry sector, grew by 22.5 per

cent, year-on-year, by end 2017. Meanwhile, other

key subsectors also attracted notable credit flows in

2017. Credit to the Agriculture and Fisheries sector

grew by 14.1 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2017,

compared to the growth of 17.0 per cent recorded

in 2016. Within this sector, credit flows directed to

the subsectors of Livestock and Dairy Farming,

Coconut, Fisheries, Vegetable, Fruit Cultivation and

Minor Food Crops, Paddy and Tea recorded notable

growth rates. Meanwhile, credit under the Personal

Loans and Advances category grew by 18.5 per

cent, year-on-year, by end 2017, compared to the

growth of 15.2 per cent recorded at end 2016. Within

the Personal Loans and Advances category, growth

of credit on account of credit cards accelerated

to 20.4 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2017,

compared to 17.5 per cent at end 2016. Moreover,

credit to all other subsectors in the Personal Loans

and Advances category recorded increases during

2017. In particular, Pawning advances, which

continued to contract since 2013, recovered during

2017 and grew by 12.1 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2017. Moreover, in terms of the maturity wise

classification of loans and advances, a slowdown

was observed across all maturities. Accordingly,

both medium term and long term credit growth

slowed substantially to 10.6 per cent and 19.0 per

cent, respectively, by end 2017, compared to 22.8

per cent and 29.9 per cent, respectively, observed

in 2016. Short term credit grew by 15.0 per cent by

end 2017, compared to a growth of 19.9 per cent

recorded in the previous year.

Broad Money (M4)

Following the same trend observed in M2b,

growth of broad money (M4)2 as measured

by the financial survey remained elevated

before moderating during the latter part of

2017. The year-on-year growth of M4 peaked at

20.7 per cent in August 2017 but moderated to

17.6 per cent by end 2017, although it remained

above the growth of 15.9 per cent recorded at

end 2016. On average, M4 growth was 18.8 per

cent in 2017 compared to 15.9 per cent observed

in 2016. Contributing to around 70 per cent of

the expansion in M4, NDA of the banking system

and Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs)

increased by Rs. 816.6 billion in 2017 supported

by credit disbursements to both private and

public sectors. Meanwhile, the overall NFA

position also improved during the year by

Rs. 349.0 billion on account of improvements

in NFA of the Central Bank and Licensed

Commercial Banks (LCBs).

a higher rate in 2017. Accordingly, the year-on-

year growth of time and savings deposits held at

these financial institutions was 19.7 per cent by

end 2017, compared to 17.1 per cent observed at

end 2016. The year-on-year growth of total time

and savings deposits held by the public at LCBs

was at 19.5 per cent by end 2017, compared to

19.3 per cent by end 2016, while that of Licensed

Specialised Banks (LSBs) increased to 15.2 per

cent by end 2017, from 10.7 per cent at end

2016. Meanwhile, reflecting relatively high rates

offered by LFCs to their depositors, year-on-year

growth of time and saving deposits held by the

public with LFCs increased significantly by 29.4

per cent at end 2017, from 9.7 per cent at end

2016.

As per M4, the year-on-year growth

of credit extended to the private sector

continued to decelerate during 2017. Private

sector credit growth based on M4 decelerated

to 14.6 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2017,

compared to 20.6 per cent recorded at end

2016, while averaging 17.7 per cent for 2017,

compared to 23.0 per cent in 2016. In absolute

terms, credit to the private sector expanded by

Rs. 836.2 billion in 2017 in comparison to

Rs. 975.9 billion in 2016, largely on account of the

credit expansion of LCBs. Following the declining

trend observed in overall credit growth by end

2017, credit growth of LFCs also moderated to

11.0 per cent, year-on-year, from 17.4 per cent

in 2016, while recording an absolute increase of

Rs. 104.2 billion during the year. Nevertheless,

credit growth of LSBs displayed an increasing

trend, recording a growth of 20.4 per cent by

end December 2017, compared to the 16.7 per

cent growth reported at end 2016. The absolute

increase in credit extended by LSBs amounted

to Rs. 114.6 billion during 2017, compared to

Rs. 80.5 billion in 2016. Further, as per M4, NCG

increased by Rs. 223.1 billion in 2017 with LSBs

contributing Rs. 30.0 billion, while NCG from

LFCs contracting by Rs. 3.3 billion in 2017.

7.5 Future Developments,

Challenges and Outlook

The Central Bank has been successful in

managing demand driven inflation and inflation

expectations, the weather affected increases in

food prices on account of factors beyond the

control of the Central Bank and going forward

the Bank is expected to continue to proactively

adopt appropriate policy measures to ensure

medium term price stability. Despite the decline in

volatile food prices and the favourable effect of the

base, which caused inflation to recede to desired

levels by early 2018, a number of risks could

challenge the Central Bank’s efforts to keep inflation

low and stable. In particular, the implementation of

price revisions to domestic energy sources, in view

of upward trending international energy prices, could

exert some pressure on inflation in the short term.

Wage pressure, which has been subdued could also

impact on core inflation and needs to be monitored

carefully. Similarly, undue supply side disruptions,

resulting from adverse and unpredictable weather

conditions, could also cause transitory shocks on

domestic prices. Inflationary pressures emanating

from such supply disruptions can appropriately be

addressed by timely supply side policies of the

government, as monetary policy measures would

be ineffective in curbing transitory supply side

inflationary pressures. To this end, the government

must focus on improving the resilience of the supply

chain by way of enhancing the productive capacity

of the agriculture sector and maintaining adequate

buffer stocks of food supply, whilst also ensuring

the timely importation of essential food items during

periods of low harvest. Supportive adjustments

to tariffs would also aid in bringing down prices of

essential items. Nevertheless, in spite of the source

of inflation, the Central Bank will continue to be

vigilant to take appropriate policy measures and

provide timely advice to the government, to ensure

that inflation expectations are checked in order to

prevent the build-up of wage pressures.

The transition to an effective FIT framework

will pave the way for sustained price stability

for the country to progress as an upper middle

income economy over the medium term. Since

the announcement of the transition to FIT in early

2017, the Central Bank has devised a ‘Road Map’

for the adoption of FIT, outlining the necessary

reforms and innovations relevant to institutional

features, operational features, monetary policy

implementation, exchange rate policy and foreign

exchange operations as well as capacity building,

to facilitate the smooth transition to the new regime.

Also, the Central Bank continued to enhance

monetary policy communication with stakeholders,

considering the growing importance of effective

communication in monetary policy transmission.

The culmination of the transition lies in the alignment

of both fiscal and monetary policy towards achieving

inflation targets, which are set in a coherent

manner. The Central Bank has made notable

progress in fulfilling the requirements pertaining

to such a framework. However, this process is to

be complemented by strengthening the Central

Bank’s mandate, credibility and autonomy through

necessary legislative amendments. Currently,

the Central Bank is engaged in a consultation

process with relevant stakeholders to revise the

MLA to enhance the focus of the mandate while

strengthening Central Bank autonomy, governance,

transparency and accountability. Moreover, in order

to sustain the macroeconomic environment, the

Central Bank will continue to adopt an appropriate

exchange rate policy to ensure increased market-

orientation in exchange rate determination.

Fiscal discipline with continued fiscal

consolidation is a crucial prerequisite for the

successful implementation of FIT. Though a

notable improvement in the primary fiscal balance

was recorded in 2017, expenditure overruns and

slippages in revenue collection, compared to the

targets, challenge the envisaged fiscal consolidation

path, thereby affecting the conduct of monetary policy.

Addressing prolonged imbalances in the fiscal sector

should be the utmost priority in resolving structural

issues in the economy. High fiscal deficits and

monetisation of such fiscal deficits would lead to

fiscal dominance over monetary policy, which is

detrimental to the monetary stability of the economy

as well as overall macroeconomic stability. The

effective implementation of the Active Liability

Management Act, together with the new hybrid

auction system in issuing government securities

and envisaged reforms in the monetary policy

framework, will alleviate any fiscal dominance in

monetary policy making. In particular, as the Central

Bank has embarked on adopting a FIT framework in

the medium term, establishing fiscal discipline and

sustaining fiscal consolidation are prime necessities

to maintain long term price stability, which is a pre-

requirement for high growth and upgraded living

standards.
