2.1 OverviewT

he Sri Lankan economy grew at a

moderate pace of 3.1 per cent in 2017,

compared to the growth of 4.5 per cent

in 2016, amidst the challenges arising from

both domestic and external fronts. Severe

drought conditions that prevailed particularly

in the major cultivation areas hindered the

growth in agriculture activities, even though a

rebound was observed during the last quarter

of the year, benefitting from the recovery in

paddy production during the 2017/18 Maha

season. Meanwhile, Industry and Services

activities contributed positively to economic

growth even in the backdrop of spillover effects

from subdued agriculture performance. The

reinstatement of GSP+ boosted manufacturing

activities, providing stimulus for Industry

activities, amidst the moderation observed

in construction activities. Services activities

expanded largely supported by the growth in

financial services, and wholesale and retail

trade activities. Further, the rationalisation of

government expenditure and the tight monetary

policy stance also affected the economic growth

in 2017. Moreover, the business surveys

conducted by the Central Bank also indicated

subdued business conditions during the year.

Meanwhile, investment expenditure grew at

a slower pace compared to the previous year

whereas consumption expenditure, which

witnessed some slowdown in the previous year,

accelerated in 2017. Even though exports grew

at a higher rate benefitting from the stronger

recovery of some of the Sri Lanka’s major

export destinations such as the US and Europe,

the substantial increase in imports resulted

in a further deterioration of the net external

demand. Meanwhile, the domestic savings grew

at a slower rate while the net primary income

from the rest of the world continued to contract

during the year. Further, net current transfers

from rest of the world moderated reflecting the

slowdown in workers’ remittances partly due to

geopolitical tensions and uncertainties in some

regions including the Middle East. Reflecting

these developments, growth in national savings

moderated during the year and the resources

gap broadened due to the relatively high growth

in investment.

2.2 GDP, GDP Per Capita and Gross National Income (GNI)

During 2017, GDP as estimated by the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), at

constant prices recorded a moderate growth

despite the higher growth observed in GDP at

current market prices1. GDP at current market

prices was estimated at Rs. 13,289.5 billion

(US dollars 87.2 billion) in 2017, while it stood

at Rs. 11,906.8 billion (US dollars 81.8 billion) in

2016. Accordingly, GDP recorded a 11.6 per cent

growth at current market prices in 2017 compared

to 8.7 per cent growth in 2016. This was reflected

by the percentage change in GDP implicit deflator,

1 DCS estimates GDP in production, expenditure and income approaches

which increased to 8.2 per cent in 2017, from

4.1 per cent in 2016. Meanwhile, GDP at constant

market prices was estimated at Rs. 9,315.5 billion

in 2017, compared to Rs. 9,034.3 billion in 2016.

Accordingly, at constant market prices, GDP growth

moderated to 3.1 per cent in 2017, compared to

4.5 per cent growth in 2016.

GDP per capita was estimated at Rs. 619,729 in

2017, compared to Rs. 561,560 in 2016, recording

an increase of 10.4 per cent in comparison to

7.5 per cent increase in 2016. This was driven by

the growth of GDP at current market prices since the

mid-year population growth rate was fairly stable.

Moreover, the per capita GDP in US dollar terms

increased to US dollars 4,065 in 2017, compared to

US dollars 3,857 in 2016, recording a higher growth

rate of 5.4 per cent, compared to the marginal growth

of 0.4 per cent in 2016, mainly due to the higher

growth of GDP at current market prices amidst the

moderate depreciation of domestic currency against

the US dollar.

GNI, which is estimated by adjusting GDP

for the net primary income from the rest of

the world, increased to Rs. 12,933.2 billion at

current market prices, recording a growth rate of

11.6 per cent in 2017, compared to 8.5 per cent

growth in 2016. This growth in GNI was a combined

outcome of the increase in the GDP growth at

current market prices and the slowdown in the

negative growth of net primary income in 2017, which

recorded a contraction of 10.9 per cent during the

year compared to 16.9 per cent contraction in 2016.

2.3 Contribution from

Institutional Sectors

As per the gross value added estimates at

current market prices, under the production

approach, the largest contribution came from

the Households and Non-Profit Institutions

Serving Households (HH and NPISH) sector.

HH and NPISH sector grew by 9.5 per cent at

current market prices in 2017, compared to

6.8 per cent growth in 2016, accounting for

50.3 per cent of the total gross value added of the

economy in 2017. Meanwhile, the Non Financial

Corporations (NFC) sector recorded a growth of

11.6 per cent in 2017, compared to 9.4 per cent

growth in 2016 and remained as the second

largest sector of the economy, accounting for a

34.9 per cent share of the total gross value added

in 2017. Further, General Government (GG)

and Financial Corporations (FC) sectors, which

accounted for 9.6 per cent and 5.2 per cent of

the total gross value added of the economy,

respectively in 2017, grew by 6.1 per cent and

21.9 per cent, respectively, in 2017 in comparison to

0.2 per cent and 17.1 per cent growth, respectively,

in 2016.

During 2017, the gross value added of

Agriculture and Services activities were mainly

driven by HH and NPISH sector, while the gross

value added of Industry activities was primarily

contributed by the NFC sector. Accordingly,

80.1 per cent of the gross value added of

Agriculture activities were generated from the HH

and NPISH sector in 2017, recording a growth of

13.4 per cent at current market prices, recovering

from the 3.0 per cent contraction recorded in

the previous year. Meanwhile, the NFC sector

accounted for 61.7 per cent of the gross value

added of the Industry activities, recording a growth

rate of 12.3 per cent at current market prices during

2017, in comparison to 10.6 per cent growth in

2016. In the meantime, 52.9 per cent of the gross

value added of Services activities was generated

by the HH and NPISH sector in 2017, recording

a growth of 8.0 per cent at current market prices,

compared to 7.0 per cent growth in 2016.

2.4 Output, Policies, Institutional Support and Issues

Agriculture

Reflecting the impact of adverse weather

conditions, the Agriculture, forestry and fishing

activities contracted by 0.8 per cent in value

added terms in 2017, compared to 3.8 per cent

contraction observed in 2016. The Agriculture

performance, which was negatively affected by the

unfavourable weather conditions that prevailed,

particularly during the first nine months of the

year, witnessed a recovery during the last quarter

of the year. The setback observed in the growing

of oleaginous fruits (coconut, king coconut, oil

palm), vegetables and rice hindered the growth in

agricultural activities. Further, growing of cereals,

fishing, sugar cane and other beverage crops

(coffee, cocoa etc.) also contracted during the year.

However, growing of tea rebounded during the

year from the declining trend observed for the last

three years. Further, forestry and logging, growing

of fruits, animal production, growing of rubber,

growing of spices, growing of other perennial

crops, and plant propagation and support activities

contributed positively to the growth of Agriculture

activities.

Agriculture Production Index

The Agriculture Production Index, which

measures the output of Agriculture and

Fisheries sectors, recorded a decline of

10.9 per cent in 2017, compared to a reduction

of 0.3 per cent in 2016. Within the index, the

sub-indices of paddy, coconut and other crops

(fruits, vegetables and other field crops) decreased,

while tea and rubber sub-indices increased

in comparison to the previous year. Livestock

activities also grew during the year, (as reflected

by the index) while a marginal growth was recorded

in fisheries activities.

Paddy

Adverse weather conditions that continued

from 2016 severely affected paddy production

during 2017. Paddy production fell by

46.1 per cent to 2.4 million metric tons during the

year, recording the lowest paddy production over

the last decade, highlighting the impact of adverse

weather conditions. Paddy production declined

in both the 2016/17 Maha season and the 2017

Yala season by 49.2 per cent and 40.1 per cent,

to 1.47 million metric tons and 0.91 million metric

tons, respectively. Although the Department of

Meteorology projected normal rainfall for 2017 for

all districts, the South West monsoon did not bring

sufficient rain for water to be stored for agricultural

purposes. Further, the North East monsoon that

usually fills up the dry zone tanks towards the

last quarter of the year also failed, leading to

low water levels to grow rice in 2017. Continued

drought conditions since 2016, led to the decline

in the extent of land sown for paddy cultivation

during both paddy growing seasons. The gross

extent sown in the 2016/17 Maha season was

542,556 hectares, which was a decrease of

28.2 per cent when compared with the previous

Maha season. Similarly, during the 2017 Yala

season, the gross extent sown declined by

35.3 per cent to 249,123 hectares, compared

to the previous Yala season. As a result, the

total gross extent sown for 2017 declined by

28.9 per cent to 791,679 hectares. Meanwhile,

inadequate water levels in major reservoirs and

the crop damages due to the drought and floods

in major paddy producing areas caused the net

extent harvested to decline by 45.1 per cent to

554,582 hectares in 2017. Gross extent harvested

in the 2016/17 Maha season declined by

48.5 per cent to 382,856 hectares, in comparison

to the previous Maha season, and that of the

2017 Yala season decreased by 37.8 per cent to

236,479 hectares, when compared with the previous

Yala season. As a result of low paddy production

in both Maha and Yala seasons, paddy yield

decreased by 1.7 per cent to 4,297 kilogrammes

per hectare, in 2017. The decline in paddy yield

during the 2016/17 Maha season was 1.1 per cent

to 4,301 kilogrammes per hectare while the decline

in the 2017 Yala season was 2.9 per cent to 4,291

kilogrammes per hectare.

The annual paddy production of both the

2016/17 Maha and 2017 Yala seasons, which was

equivalent to 1.7 million metric tons of rice, was

estimated to be adequate to meet the domestic

demand for approximately eight months. The

deficit, which amounted to around 800,000 metric

tons was met through imports since the beginning

of 2017. Under the recommendations of the

government’s Cost of Living Committee (CoLC),

the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MIC) made

arrangements to import rice, while allowing the

private sector to import rice directly as well. The aim

of the CoLC was to support consumers with lower

prices while ensuring uninterrupted rice supplies to

the market. Accordingly, the MIC imported Samba,

Nadu and white raw rice from countries such as

India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and

Thailand. Consequently, 747,800 metric tons of rice

have been imported into Sri Lanka during the year,

at a total cost of US dollars 300.9 million, compared

to 29,524 metric tons of rice imports during 2016.

Further, Cabinet approval was granted to release

stocks of paddy available with the Paddy Marketing

Board (PMB) in a timely manner, to dampen price

pressures in the market. Accordingly, the Lanka

Sathosa network sold rice milled from paddy

purchased from the PMB during 2017.

Open market paddy prices remained

relatively high due to limited supplies entering

the market, as a result of low production from

all major paddy producing areas, given the

adverse weather conditions. The average price

of Samba paddy was Rs. 50.48 per kilogramme

during 2017, which is an increase of 29.4 per cent

in comparison to 2016. Meanwhile, the average

price of Nadu paddy also increased significantly by

41.5 per cent to Rs. 49.57 per kilogramme in 2017,

compared to the previous year. The shortage in the

paddy supply caused an increase in the resultant

retail rice prices, which prompted the government

to take various measures to stabilise rice prices,

including the introduction of a maximum retail price

for locally produced rice and augmenting the supply

through rice imports. On average, the retail price

of Samba was Rs. 98.71 per kilogramme in 2017,

recording an increase of 6.4 per cent, compared

to 2016, while the average retail price of Nadu in

2017 was Rs. 90.97 per kilogramme, which was an

increase of 14.4 per cent compared to the previous

year.

The government took steps to reduce taxes

for imported rice, with a view to preventing the

escalation in prices, in addition to enforcing

a maximum retail price for selected varieties

of rice. The tax reduction was implemented by

removing the existing taxes, which were effective

since November 2016 and introducing a Special

Commodity Levy (SCL) of Rs.15.00 per kilogramme

for imported rice. The government further reduced

the SCL on imported rice to Rs. 5.00, with effect

from 27 January 2017. The SCL imposed on

imported rice was further reduced to 25 cents

per kilogramme, with effect from 27 July 2017 and

this reduction of tax will be effective till 30 April

2018. Moreover, in order to address rising prices

of all rice varieties in spite of higher imports, the

government imposed a maximum retail price for

local and imported rice varieties, with effect from

17 February 2017, which was subsequently

removed on 16 August 2017 but reintroduced for

Nadu on 26 December 2017.

Tea

Tea production recorded a positive growth in

2017, reversing the declining trend of the past

four years. Accordingly, production recovered with

a growth of 5.2 per cent, resulting in an output of

307.7 million kilogrammes in 2017, compared to

292.6 million kilogrammes in 2016. The reversal

in the trend for tea production after the continuous

decline in recent years was recorded amidst crop

losses resulting from dry weather conditions that

prevailed in major tea growing areas since 2015,

restrictions on the application of selected weedicides

such as glyphosate and labour constraints leading

to high cost of production. However, tea production

revived owing to most factories operating at

increased capacity and favourable agro-climatic

conditions in many tea planting districts, particularly

during the second half of the year which were

ideal for the rapid growth of tea leaves. The

highest share of total tea production amounting to

64.3 per cent was from low grown tea, which

increased by 7.5 per cent to 197.4 million

kilogrammes in 2017. High grown tea, which

accounted for around 21 per cent of the total

tea production, witnessed a marginal growth of

0.3 per cent to record an output of 64.6 million

kilogrammes. Production of medium grown

tea increased marginally by 2.6 per cent to

45.7 million kilogrammes in 2017, compared to

the previous year. Meanwhile, the tea smallholder

sector contributed to 75.4 per cent of the total tea

production in 2017.

The average prices at the Colombo Tea

Auction (CTA) witnessed a continuation of

the upward momentum recorded since the

last quarter of 2016, with increased demand

from some of the major importers. Average

price at the CTA for the year 2017 increased

significantly by 31.1 per cent to Rs. 620.44

per kilogramme, compared to the previous year.

The highest increase was recorded for high grown

tea (35.6 per cent), followed by medium grown tea

(32.2 per cent) and low grown tea (30.4 per cent).

The average export price of tea (FOB), increased

significantly by 26.2 per cent to Rs. 807.44

per kilogramme during 2017, from Rs. 639.88

per kilogramme recorded during 2016, supported

by higher demand and the depreciation of the

domestic currency. The volume of tea offered

at the CTA recorded a marginal increase of

0.1 per cent in 2017, while export earnings grew by

20.5 per cent during the year when compared to

2016. The average price received by tea

smallholders for green leaf increased to

Rs. 90.69 per kilogramme in 2017, from Rs. 68.53

per kilogramme in 2016. The steady rise in global

oil prices during 2017 had a favourable impact on

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

48

the income levels of major tea importing countries,

resulting in a higher demand for Sri Lankan tea.

Meanwhile, Turkey has maintained its position as

the leading importer of “Ceylon Tea”. It is envisaged

that this increasing trend in tea prices would

encourage domestic tea producers to increase

production during 2018 as well. However, the yield

per hectare is low in Sri Lanka when compared

with major tea producing countries in the world

highlighting the need to encourage new planting

and replanting.

Rubber

Rubber production grew by 5.1 per cent

to 83.1 million kilogrammes in 2017, from

79.1 million kilogrammes recorded in 2016.

This growth in natural rubber production was

achieved amidst unfavourable weather conditions,

particularly during the first half of the year, which

resulted in severe floods in traditional rubber growing

areas. Among the major categories of rubber

produced, sheet rubber production, the largest

component of total rubber production, increased by

4.4 per cent to 41.5 million kilogrammes, while

crepe rubber production decreased considerably

by 23.3 per cent to 11.5 million kilogrammes in

2017. Meanwhile, the production of unspecified

category of rubber recorded a significant increase of

23.9 per cent to 30.1 million kilogrammes during

2017, when compared to the previous year. The

average yield for rubber was 809 kilogrammes per

hectare in 2017, which was a marginal increase

of 1.1 per cent from the average yield recorded in

2016. The low yield in rubber was primarily driven

by the decline in the number of tapping days,

particularly in the smallholder sector, where key

producers of Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) slowed

down tapping operations in response to adverse

weather conditions. Nevertheless, the cost of

production of rubber has been increasing over the

years, and in 2017 it increased by 8.3 per cent

to Rs. 195.00 per kilogramme, from Rs. 180.00

per kilogramme that was recorded in 2016, making

rubber production less attractive for the smallholder

sector. Domestic rubber consumption declined by

9.2 per cent in 2017 to 129 million kilogrammes,

since industries depended on imported raw material

for their value added products mainly due to the

lower prices quoted for imported raw material.

Natural rubber exports increased by 6.6 per cent to

17.2 million kilogrammes in 2017 compared to the

previous year. With the increase in global rubber

prices towards the end of 2017, the domestic

market also witnessed an increasing trend in

prices. The favourable global demand, particularly

for natural rubber, improved local prices of latex

crepe and RSS Number 1 (RSS1). The average

price of RSS1 registered a significant increase of

40.7 per cent to record Rs. 336.72 per kilogramme,

whilst the average price of latex crepe also

witnessed an increase of 34.1 per cent, attracting

Rs. 351.71 per kilogramme at the Colombo Rubber

Auction during 2017. China, the largest rubber

consuming economy in the world, increased its

import volumes to replenish its gradually depleting

buffer stocks. This indicates that the demand for

domestic rubber is likely to increase in the medium

term, which is an encouraging development for

the local rubber manufacturing industry. However,

to harness the full potential of the rubber sector,

domestic backward and forward linkages need to

be developed to promote higher domestic value

addition and reduce the dependence on foreign

demand.

Coconut

Coconut production, which recorded

a marginal drop of 1.4 per cent to reach

3,011 million nuts in 2016, declined substantially

by 18.7 per cent to 2,450 million nuts in 2017.

The decline in coconut production was mainly

attributed to the lagged effect of the prolonged

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

49

drought conditions, which commenced in 2016

and continued into 2017 in the major coconut

growing areas. The drought situation had a severe

impact on major coconut growing areas, such

as Kurunegala, Puttalam and Gampaha, which

resulted in lower coconut production throughout

the year. The decline in coconut production was

particularly severe in the last quarter of 2017,

where the production declined by 28.2 per cent to

539.4 million nuts, in comparison to the

corresponding quarter of 2016. This contraction

in nut production impacted adversely on

coconut related industries as well. Accordingly,

desiccated coconut production decreased by

42.2 per cent, to 29,557 metric tons in 2017

from 51,117 metric tons in 2016. Meanwhile,

coconut oil production decreased substantially by

73.8 per cent from 48,805 metric tons to

12,784 metric tons and virgin coconut oil

production decreased by 11.4 per cent from

16,067 metric tons to 14,233 metric tons. Despite

the reduction in nut production, coconut cream,

coconut milk powder and coconut milk production

increased by 10.1 per cent to 46,941 metric tons

in 2017, compared to 42,643 metric tons in 2016,

owing to the increased export demand.

The decline in coconut production

that created a severe shortage of nuts for

consumption as well as for industrial usage

resulted in coconut prices escalating to

unprecedented levels in 2017. Accordingly, the

average wholesale price of fresh nuts in the local

market increased significantly by 95.2 per cent

to Rs. 62.71 per nut. Consequently, the average

retail price of fresh nuts increased by 47.1 per cent

to Rs. 67.40 per nut during the year. The three

major kernel product exports, namely desiccated

coconut, copra and coconut oil, decreased by

39.0 per cent, with export earnings from these

products recording a decrease of 8.1 per cent.

Meanwhile, the average cost of production, which is

estimated at Rs. 16.69 per nut remained unchanged

in 2017 compared to 2016. The government took a

number of measures to ease the supply shortfall

and subsequent price pressures. Accordingly, the

Coconut Development Authority (CDA) temporarily

discontinued issuing approvals for fresh nut

exports from June 2017. Meanwhile, coconut

processors requested to liberalise coconut imports,

considering the short supply of coconuts in the

domestic market to fulfil regular export demands.

Accordingly, a policy decision was taken to import

coconut kernel required for industries, subject to

the recommendations of the committee appointed

to monitor the importation of coconut kernel.

Meanwhile, considering the market situation, the

government revised the SCL on palm oil products

with the aim of reducing the demand for coconut

towards coconut oil production.

Minor Export Crops

Production of minor export crops declined

in 2017 compared to 2016. According to the

Department of Export Agriculture, the production

of minor export crops (MECs), which consist of

12 major types of crops, registered a decline of

5.9 per cent to 131,189 metric tons. While the

production of some crops, such as cinnamon,

pepper, cloves and nutmeg increased considerably,

the production of crops such as cardamom, coffee,

cocoa, arecanut, betel leaves, ginger, turmeric and

citronella declined. The reduction in production was

a result of multiple factors, such as dry weather and

the unusual shift in rainfall patterns in MEC growing

areas, increase in the cost of production and price

fluctuations in export markets. The planted extent

increased in 2017, especially for cinnamon, pepper

and citronella. Meanwhile, the volume of MEC

related exports increased by 31.7 per cent in 2017

to 57,703 metric tons, over 2016. Betel leaves

recorded a notable increase in exports during 2017,

compared to 2016. Meanwhile, import volumes of

MECs in 2017 had also increased by 16.0 per cent

compared to 2016, mainly due to the increase in

the import of pepper, cocoa, turmeric and ginger.

Pepper imports to Sri Lanka were banned by the

government following concerns that low quality

imports were being re-exported to other countries

under the existing trade agreements.

Other Field Crops

Adverse weather conditions that prevailed

during 2017 hampered the production of other

field crops (OFCs). Accordingly, total OFC output

during the year stood at 509,076 metric tons, which

was a decline of 20.0 per cent compared to 2016,

while the cultivation extent recorded a drop of

24.5 per cent. Most varieties of OFCs declined

during 2017 with the exception of sorghum,

meneri and soya beans. Production of potato,

which increased steadily during the last five

years, reported a decline of 23.4 per cent due to

the reduction in the extent cultivated. Meanwhile,

red onion and big onion production decreased by

9.3 per cent and 17.8 per cent, respectively.

Reflecting the impact of the decline in the domestic

output, potato and big onion imports increased

by 2.3 per cent and 7.8 per cent, respectively.

Production of green chillies declined significantly

during the year by 28.3 per cent to 51,827

metric tons. Accordingly, average retail price of

green chillies escalated significantly during the

year owing to low market supply. Although the

total extent under OFCs cultivation declined, the

cultivation extent of less water intensive crops such

as soya beans increased, resulting in a considerable

production growth of 80.8 per cent. The impact of

adverse weather conditions highlights the need to

improve resilience of the sector through better water

management, improved seed quality and efficient

markets that would ensure better coordination

between the supply and demand of OFC.

Vegetables

Vegetable production, which improved

in 2016 amidst adverse weather conditions,

recorded a decline in output during 2017.

Vegetable production dropped by 9.1 per cent to

1.5 million metric tons in 2017. Production of both

low-country and up-country vegetables decreased

considerably due to the adverse weather conditions

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

51

that prevailed throughout the year. As the onset

of both monsoons delayed, the commencement

of cultivation of both the Maha and Yala seasons,

particularly in the up-country areas was delayed.

Resultantly, the extent of vegetables cultivated

decreased by 6.7 per cent during the year. This

was the combined effect of a 7.6 per cent decrease

of the cultivated extent during the 2016/17 Maha

season and 5.5 per cent decrease in the cultivated

extent during the 2017 Yala season. Responding

to the lower production of vegetables, the prices

remained high during the first half of the year and

subsequently decreased during the third quarter

of the year with the commencement of harvesting

during the 2017 Yala season. However, prices

escalated again during the fourth quarter of the

year, with the onset of the off peak season for

vegetables. However, vegetable production in

Jaffna helped to curtail the price pressure in the

market to some extent. On the other hand, the high

percentage of post-harvest losses during handling

contribute towards the escalation in prices, which

needs to be reduced, particularly against the

backdrop of adverse weather conditions, with a

view to mitigating price pressures. Accordingly,

the Agriculture sector would benefit from a well

managed agriculture logistics network, particularly

with respect to highly perishable crops. Meanwhile,

21,696.6 metric tons of vegetables valued at

Rs. 4.3 billion were exported during the year. The

shift towards commercial agricultural activities that

has the potential for investment in better technology

would support export earnings as well as enhance

livelihoods of people who are engaged in these

activities.

Fruits

Fruit production increased during 2017,

recovering from the decline in production that

was recorded in the previous year. There was an

increase in overall fruit production by 9.5 per cent

to 1,569,858 metric tons in 2017. The production

of plantain, mango, papaw, melon, pineapple and

guava increased, while the production of oranges,

lime, passion fruit and avocado declined from the

previous year. Despite the increased production, fruit

prices remained elevated due to the high demand,

particularly from the tourism sector. During 2017,

Sri Lanka imported 76,139.3 metric tons of fruits

valued at Rs. 12.9 billion, while exporting 31,320

metric tons valued at Rs. 6.3 billion. Even though

a large variety of fruits are being exported, export

oriented commercial cultivation is limited to a few

crops such as plantains and pineapples, which are

cultivated in an organised manner as an inter crop.

Although Sri Lanka exports a considerable amount of

fruits, the sector could be further developed through

commercial cultivation methods such as investing in

controlled environments using tissue cultured plants,

which would increase the output as well as the quality

of the produce.

Sugar

Sugar production declined in 2017 compared

to 2016 mainly as a result of dry weather

conditions in sugarcane growing areas, thus

reversing the increasing trend recorded in the

last two years. While cultivation of high yielding

sugarcane varieties, access to proper irrigation

systems and field maintenance, and the expansion

in planting activities of out-growers contributed to

increasing the sugar production in 2015 and 2016,

the dry weather conditions that prevailed during

most parts of Sri Lanka in 2017 negated the effect

of growth enhancing policies. These adverse weather

conditions increased the severity of moisture stress,

which retarded crop growth and lowered the sucrose

content in the cane, thus reducing the sugar recovery

rate (the percentage of sugar produced out of the

amount of sugarcane crushed).2 The heavy rains

2

Sugar Produced

Quantity of Cane Crushed

x 100 Sugar Recovery Rate =

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

52

that followed the dry period reduced sugar recovery

as well. Meanwhile, the spread of the white leaf

and smut diseases and sugarcane borers, and the

inefficiency of plant and machinery that are more than

two decades old aggravated the effect of the drought.

Total sugar produced by Pelwatte, Sevanagala

and Gal Oya (Hingurana) factories declined by

9.3 per cent to 55,552 metric tons in 2017, compared

to 61,265 metric tons in 2016. The decline in

production in 2017 was a combined outcome of the

decline in the amount of sugarcane crushed and

the decline in the sugar recovery rate. The extent

harvested and the amount of cane harvested declined,

resulting in the amount of sugarcane crushed in all

three factories declining by 6.3 per cent to 747,662

metric tons in 2017. The total sugar recovery

rate of all three factories declined to 7.4 per cent

from 7.7 per cent in 2016. The amount of sugarcane

supplied by private out-growers increased

by 2.8 per cent in 2017. Meanwhile, Pelwatte,

Sevanagala and Gal Oya factories accounted for

49.8 per cent, 27.4 per cent and 22.9 per cent,

respectively, of the total sugar production in 2017.

However, the Gal Oya factory, which recorded a poor

performance during the first half of 2017, compared

to the first half of 2016, rebounded and recorded a

substantially larger production in the second half,

resulting in a 29.1 per cent increase in 2017, compared

to 2016. Meanwhile, Pelwatte and Sevanagala

factories recorded negative growth rates of

19.1 per cent and 11.8 per cent, respectively,

compared to 2016. Sugar production in 2017 was

sufficient to meet about 10 per cent of the total

sugar demand in the country. Sugar imports in

2017 was lower at 498,952 metric tons, compared to

651,181 metric tons in 2016. Sugar consumption by

households depict a declining trend as per the recent

Household Income and Expenditure Surveys of the

DCS, indicating a possible moderation in domestic

sugar consumption. Meanwhile, through the National

Budget for 2017, the government afforded an

increased priority to increase sugar production by

calling for the establishment of new factories and

encouraging out-growers, with the aim of improving

the output in the medium to long-term.

Fisheries

During 2017, fish production remained almost

unchanged compared to the level recorded in

2016. There was a marginal increase in the total fish

production by 0.1 per cent to 531,310 metric tons in

2017. Marine fish production, which accounted for

84.6 per cent of the total fish production in 2017,

declined by 1.7 per cent to 449,440 metric tons, while

inland fish production increased by 10.7 per cent

to 81,870 metric tons. The reduction in marine fish

production was a result of the decline in coastal fish

production by 5.3 per cent to 259,720 metric tons,

whereas offshore fish production, which comprise the

rest of marine fishing, increased by 3.8 per cent to

189,720 metric tons. Inland fish production increased

mainly due to the growth in inland capture by

17.3 per cent to 68,510 metric tons, while inland

aquaculture, and shrimp and prawn production,

which account for the remainder of inland

fish production, declined by 7.9 per cent and

23.4 per cent, respectively, to 8,740 metric tons

and 4,620 metric tons. While policy support and

the removal of the ban on fish exports to the EU

helped sustain fish production, the adverse weather

conditions that affected the Western and Southern

coastal areas during May and November 2017,

prolonged dry weather in the deep-sea and substantial

post-harvest losses had an adverse impact on marine

fishing. The National Aquatic Resources Research

and Development Agency has estimated that

40 to 60 per cent of the fish catch is destroyed as

unfit for both consumption and processing into dried

fish. Meanwhile, the droughts that dried up inland

water bodies and the “white spot disease” that spread

among shrimp and prawns, affected inland fish

production levels in 2017. Meanwhile, fish exports

increased by 41.8 per cent in volume terms and

48.5 per cent in rupee terms, compared to 2016,

following the removal of the ban on fish exports to the

EU in 2016. Exports of fish to the EU accounted for

23.1 per cent of total fish exports in 2017, and grew

by 125 per cent over 2016. Meanwhile, fish imports to

Sri Lanka declined in 2017 by 8.4 per cent in volume

terms and 3.4 per cent in rupee terms.

Livestock

The total national milk production grew by

3.2 per cent to 396.2 million litres in 2017,

compared to 2016, due to policy actions such as

distributing high-yielding cows and increasing

the guaranteed price of milk to farmers, which

saw a higher private sector investment into the

dairy sector in 2017. Cow milk, which accounted for

82.7 per cent of the total milk production, increased by

3.1 per cent to 327.6 million litres, while buffalo milk

production, which accounted for the rest, increased

by 3.7 per cent to 68.6 million litres. Meanwhile, milk

production at the National Livestock Development

Board (NLDB) decreased to 15.0 million litres in 2017

from 17.9 million litres in 2016. The Department of

Animal Production and Health (DAPH) estimates

that domestic milk production was sufficient to meet

40 per cent of milk consumption of the country during

2017, while the rest was met through imported milk

powder. However, 42 per cent of the domestic milk

consumption was met with domestic sources in 2016,

highlighting the need for continued efforts in improving

domestic production to meet the government

objective of increasing food security. Meanwhile, milk

powder imports decreased by 0.9 per cent to 93,127

metric tons in 2017. The average cost of production

of a litre of milk was Rs. 34.69, while the average

farmgate price was Rs. 66.34 in 2017. Increase in

the price of concentrate feed due to higher prices of

coconut poonac and rice bran led to an increase in the

cost of production in 2017. The DAPH observed that

during 2017, a considerable number of entrepreneurs

invested in dairy enterprises by establishing

large-scale dairy farms using imported heifer cows

and new technology.

Production of eggs and most types of meat

increased substantially in 2017. Production of

eggs increased by 0.6 per cent to 2,072.9 million

eggs in 2017, which is the highest level of production

recorded in five years. Increased imports of layer

parents supported this expansion in production

during the year. However, the DAPH observed that

the supply mechanism was not sufficiently organised

to accommodate this large increase in production,

which led to an instability in the distribution channels

and prices during the latter part of 2017. The cost

of production of a large scale egg increased to

Rs. 12.81 per egg from Rs. 12.40 per egg in 2016.

The average price of an egg in 2017 was Rs. 14.08,

compared to Rs. 16.10 in 2016, mainly due to the

increase in production. Chicken production increased

by 7.6 per cent to 196.6 metric tons in 2017. Import

of broiler parents increased to 382,421 in 2017, from

333,424 in 2016, whereas the local production of

broiler parents decreased to 1.1 million in 2017, from

1.3 million in 2016. The ceiling price imposed for broiler

chicken, which was Rs. 420.00 per kilogramme, was

removed with effect from 14 March 2017. Production

of pork and mutton also increased by 8.4 per cent

and 1.4 per cent, to 7,890 metric tons and 1,420

metric tons, respectively. Meanwhile, beef production

declined by 4.5 per cent to 30,130 metric tons in 2017.

Agriculture Policies and Institutional Support

The government implemented several

programmes targeting the UN Sustainable

Development Goal (SDG) on zero hunger,

to ensure food security and sustainable

agriculture. In the context of this broad policy

framework, the government’s agricultural policy

encouraged the sector through specific policies

consistent with its key objective, while allowing

a greater role to the private sector. Further, the

government launched programmes to redesign

policies, grant tax concessions on machinery and

fertiliser, rehabilitate tanks, provide new technology

and modernise agricultural research and training to

encourage higher youth participation in agriculture.

Emphasis has also been placed on the development

of aquaculture and poultry sectors in view of

export earnings and increasing potential for more

employment in these two sectors. Even though

the government paddy purchasing programme

continued to operate in 2017, PMB was unable

to purchase stocks of paddy during the year, as

market prices were higher than the price paid by

the government due to low paddy production. The

Rice Research and Development Institute (RRDI)

developed climate resilient rice varieties and

assessed the strength of resistance at the field

level. Although the evaluation of submergence

tolerant rice varieties could not be completed due

to damages in the flood prone areas, a drought

tolerant rice variety, BG 251 was released after

successful evaluation. Meanwhile, with a view of

promoting the Blue - Green economic programme,

the government provided various incentives

in the National Budget 2018. These included

tax concessions for implementing greenhouse

technology that enables advanced technology in

agriculture practices, de-silting small and medium

tanks in a systematic manner for harvesting

rainwater, new weather based insurance cover

for farmers and a cost sharing scheme for the

fisheries sector. Steps have also been taken to

improve research and product development in the

plantation industry and to strengthen cinnamon

and the pepper industries to increase production

and value addition.

Tea industry in Sri Lanka celebrated its

150th Anniversary in 2017, with the Sri Lanka

Tea Board (SLTB) organising several events

locally and globally in collaboration with related

institutions to celebrate this milestone while

continuing with other development activities

to promote the industry. Activities undertaken by

the SLTB focused on brand promotion, trade mark

protection of the Ceylon Tea lion logo, registration

of Ceylon Tea under geographical indications and

global promotional campaigns, which largely fell in

line with the 150th anniversary celebrations. The

SLTB continued to provide financial assistance to

tea exporting companies to take part in international

trade fairs operated by the SLTB, under the subsidy

scheme for trade fair participation. Meanwhile,

the SLTB continued its efforts on maintaining the

“B Leaf 60” Programme aimed at upgrading

average best leaf standards from 33.0 per cent to

60.0 per cent. The SLTB continued the tea replanting

subsidy scheme, granting Rs. 32.5 million for

177.6 hectares and the tea factory modernisation

scheme, providing subsidies amounting to

Rs. 33.2 million for 60 tea factories. During 2017,

71 factories obtained the Hazard Analysis and

Critical Control Point (HACCP) Certification, which

is a systematic preventive approach to ensure

food safety from biological, chemical, and physical

hazards during the production processes, which

can cause the finished product to be unsafe,

and design measures to reduce these risks to

an acceptable level. The Tea Research Institute

(TRI) undertook research and development

activities in the areas of crop improvement and

management, land productivity improvement,

climate change adaptation, mechanisation of field

practices and improvement of the quality of made

tea to address the needs of the tea industry as

per the TRI Strategic Plan 2013 – 2017. New tea

cultivars to improve productivity and quality under

the TRI 5000 series were released as TRI 5001,

5002, 5003 and 5004, which are more suitable for

up-country tea growing areas. Grafting technique

was used for the development of suitable

combination of traits for different tea growing

regions, with respect to drought and blister blight

tolerance, and some combinations revealed

positive results. Evaluation of UV treated artificial

mulching material in new land clearings for

soil moisture conservation and weed control

continued. Organically cultivated experimental

blocks were evaluated based on crop, soil and

pest incidences. A project developed by TRI for

popularising mechanical harvesters and devices

in the smallholdings continued in 2017. The Tea

Small Holdings Development Authority (TSHDA)

continued the implementation of tea replanting,

new planting and crop rehabilitation subsidy

programmes, while introducing an insurance

scheme for tea smallholders. During the year,

748 hectares were replanted both in regional

plantation companies and smallholdings at a cost

of Rs. 454.7 million, while 202 hectares were newly

planted at a cost of Rs. 60.2 million. The TSHDA,

as the implementation agency of the Smallholder

Tea and Rubber Revitalisation (STaRR) project,

introduced an upfront payment of Rs. 150,000

per hectare as a replanting subsidy to improve

the replanting rate. Financial relief amounting to

Rs. 313 million was provided to tea smallholders

for the damages caused to tea cultivations by the

floods and landslides in May 2017.

With a strategy to increase annual rubber

production to 200,000 metric tons by 2030 from

the current level of 83,100 metric tons, the

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Rubber Development Department (RDD) and

the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) continued

their development activities. The 2017 annual

action plan for achieving the above targets included

productivity improvements and expansion of rubber

cultivation to non-traditional areas as the main

strategies. Meanwhile, coordination and progress

reviewing of activities were carried out under the

rubber cultivation programme in the Ampara district

through the STaRR project. The master plan for

the rubber industry was launched in May 2017

and steps have been taken to set up a Rubber

Development Secretariat in collaboration with the

public and private sectors to implement this plan.

Under productivity improvements, 787.1 hectares

were replanted in the rubber smallholder sector

and 59.5 hectares were replanted in the corporate

sector, while 208.8 hectares were newly planted in

traditional rubber growing areas and 464.4 hectares

were newly planted in non-traditional rubber

growing areas with the aim of expanding the area

under rubber cultivation. A committee was appointed

to regularise extension services of the rubber

sector, which expedited the process of restructuring

RDD and commenced a research and extension

dialogue between the RDD and the RRI. Measures

were taken by the RRI to promote value addition

of raw rubber production aimed at developing

high-end rubber based products, promote

methodologies such as low intensity harvesting

to reduce the increasing cost of production and

promote replanting high yielding clones in rubber

lands. In addition, research activities were carried

out in developing crepe rubber based toys,

developing latex based compound for inner lining

of tanks, developing vulcanising systems for latex

based products and testing of organic and inorganic

mulching for weed control, while carrying out their

regular research activities. The rubber production

sector suffers from lack of competitiveness,

with low productivity levels resulting from poor

adoption of required agro-management practices.

Particularly in the smallholder sector, professional

plantation management systems with a cluster

approach would be beneficial to adopt proper

agro-management practices to increase overall

productivity of smallholdings. Further, the

introduction of productivity based incentive systems

for plantation management is required to motivate

rubber growers to increase productivity.

The Coconut Research Institute (CRI),

CDA and Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB)

continued their developmental activities

in the coconut sector in 2017. Ministry of

Plantation Industries continued to maintain

the buffer zone and the area affected by the

Weligama Coconut Leaf Wilt disease from

preventing the spread of the disease beyond

the affected area. Under this programme,

4,081 diseased palms were marked and 3,033

diseased palms were removed. Meanwhile,

approval was granted to import 259,900 oil palm

seeds for five Regional Plantation Companies

in the year 2017, under the supervision of the

CRI, as a policy decision was taken to expand

Sri Lanka's oil palm cultivation up to 20,000

hectares. Further, a scientific study on the

environment impact of oil palm cultivation is being

conducted with the collaboration of the Central

Environmental Authority (CEA). During the year,

the CCB took a policy decision to increase the

amount of coconut seedlings distributed on

cash basis to enhance the production capacity.

In addition, subsidy programmes for soil

conservation, organic fertiliser and dolomite

application promotion, and drip irrigation

systems were initiated to increase coconut

production in the short-term. Under the fertiliser

subsidy programme, the CCB distributed cash

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

57

subsidies of Rs. 480 million, covering 170,855

beneficiaries. However, it is noted that productive

coconut lands are getting fragmented in recent

times, which has a considerable impact on coconut

production. Meanwhile, Ministry of Plantation

Industries organised the CRT (Coconut, Rubber

and Tea) Trade Fair 2017 to provide a platform

to the global partners in coconut, rubber and tea

industries to meet, network and share knowledge

and information on various aspects of industry

operations.

The government enhanced its support

for sugar production in 2017 with a set of

well-placed strategies. As proposed in the

National Budget for 2017, the Ministry of Industry

and Commerce invited local and foreign investors

to invest in sugar factories in Moneragala,

Batticaloa, Killinochchi and Ampara Districts,

with a minimum plant capacity to crush 2,000

metric tons of sugarcane per day. The government

is to provide land to all factories to cultivate

sugarcane under the out-grower system.

Meanwhile, the Board of Investment entered into

an agreement with a foreign investor to re-establish

the Kantale sugar factory on a Public Private

Partnership basis. The government also imposed a

cess of 2 per cent for sugar imports and 5 per cent

for ethanol imports to establish a sugar stabilisation

fund that will protect sugarcane farmers from the

adverse impact of price fluctuations, weather

conditions, and pest and elephant attacks. In

order to encourage local sugarcane farmers,

a minimum price of Rs. 5,000 per metric ton of

sugarcane, based on the ex-factory price formula,

was established with effect from 01 January 2017.

The Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI), which

falls under the purview of the Ministry of Plantation

Industries, initiated the process necessary

to amend the Sugarcane Research Institute

Act No. 75 of 1981 to reflect the new sugar sector

policy of the government. Meanwhile, the SRI

continued to support the industry with research and

extension. The SRI was successful at identifying

five sugarcane varieties for jaggery production

and five more varieties for sugar production, which

were released for commercial cultivation in 2017.

Further, the SRI produced foundation seeds and

maintained nurseries to provide seed cane to

farmers. In order to fight pest attacks, the SRI

conducted pest and disease surveys in selected

Sri Lankan plantations with the help of an insect

identification service in Pakistan, and identified

two borer species that were not recorded before.

Throughout 2017, the SRI carried out research into

herbicide treatments, appropriate soil conditions,

seedlings, cost and income estimates for different

geographic areas as well. The SRI also conducted

training programmes and field demonstrations, and

educated the farmers on the correct application of

fertiliser to increase the recovery rate. During the

year, the Gal Oya Plantations (Pvt) Ltd completed

the project to build an ethanol distillery. Providing

irrigation facilities to the sugarcane cultivations

will be a main method of increasing the recovery

rate and overall production as well as managing

the effects of adverse weather conditions.

The Pelwatte plantation has already started building

the “Gal Amuna” canal project. Further, since at

least four Ministries are overseeing the different

factories and sugar related research, maintaining

a unified effort with clear consolidated strategic

direction will be necessary to ensure the realisation

of the government’s commendable plan to improve

the domestic sugar industry.

The Department of Agriculture (DOA) carried

out several programmes aimed at supporting

the agriculture sector during 2017. The DOA

implemented various programmes to increase

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

58

productivity in the agriculture sector. Under

the Korea Project on International Agriculture

(KOPIA), a rice processing centre was established

in Rajanganaya and a big onion seed production

programme was conducted in Anuradhapura and

Mannar districts. The DOA continued with climate

resilient agriculture related research activities

and new varieties of OFCs and horticulture

crops were released during the year. Under the

contract growing programme, the DOA purchased

3,340.9 metric tons of certified seed paddy, 789.9

metric tons of registered and certified seeds of

OFC and 3.9 metric tons of standard vegetable

seeds. Initiatives were taken to improve livelihoods

of farmer families, while 30 women organisations

were registered in connection with the “Hela Bojun”

sales outlets. Under the project on promoting Good

Agricultural Practices (GAP), 146 farms have been

certified and 22 GAP demonstration farms have

been established, while developing a database

on commercial farms to facilitate better availability

of information to stakeholders. The fertiliser cash

grant scheme continued during the year covering

paddy, OFCs and smallholders of tea, coconut

and rubber. During the year, the government

expenditure on fertiliser subsidy programme

amounted to around Rs. 30.4 billion. However,

there was a fertiliser shortage during the 2017/18

Maha season, highlighting the need for a more

efficient mechanism to provide fertiliser to farmers

in the country. With a view to promoting organic

agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture continued

the organic fertiliser production programme and

the DOA took measures to set up 20 district level

soil testing laboratories to re-evaluate fertiliser

recommendations. Meanwhile, an exhibition was

conducted at the Centre for Excellence in Organic

Agriculture at Makandura to promote the use of

organic fertiliser.

The government continued with measures

aimed at improving the irrigation infrastructure

of the country during 2017. The construction

of the Moragahakanda reservoir, under the

Moragahakanda-Kaluganga Development Project

(MKDP) of the Mahaweli development plan, has

already been completed and the construction

of the Kaluganga reservoir is under way, which

will be completed by mid-2018. Accordingly,

under the Mahaweli Water Security Investment

Programme (MWSIP), the Upper Elehera canal

will be constructed to transfer water for agriculture

and drinking purposes to the dry zone areas in the

North and North Central Provinces, in the coming

years. Accordingly, the project would help towards

further uplifting the socio-economic welfare of the

people in the Northern Province and providing safe

drinking water to a large population that suffers

from drought and lack of safe drinking water.

Meanwhile, the Budget 2018 proposed to allocate

Rs. 2.0 billion to support programmes and activities

under rural irrigation development including drip

irrigation, rain water harvesting, and integrated

village development. The Department of Irrigation

commenced the Polonnaruwa District Irrigation

Development Project and Accelerated Irrigation

Development project in the Moneragala district to

improve access to irrigated water sources in the

areas.

The government continued to support the

dairy industry through policy measures and

providing support services through the DAPH.

The government increased the guaranteed price

paid to dairy farmers to Rs. 70.00 per litre of milk

from June 2017. This measure was a welcome

incentive for dairy farmers and encouraged new

investments into the sector. The government also

took steps to import high yielding cattle during

the year. Meanwhile, the National Livestock

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

59

Development Board (NLDB) finalised the plans

to develop Dairy Development Zones through

Public-Private Partnerships, using underutilised

lands of the NLDB. In order to support the poultry

industry, the government allowed maize imports

to Sri Lanka in 2017. DAPH carried out numerous

projects in line with the Livestock Sector Master

Plan of the government. A new veterinary office was

established in the Kegalle District, while another

seven veterinary service offices are currently being

established throughout the country. Through the

Livestock (Dairy) Breeding Project that seeks to

boost milk production by strengthening the artificial

insemination centres, progeny testing of bull-calves

for natural breeding and pasture development

were carried out. Through the Heifer Calf Rearing

Project, support was provided to farmers to feed

and manage artificially born female calves. DAPH

also carried out vaccination of animals and

conducted a programme to control the Mastitis

disease that prevails among dairy herd. Quarantine

and surveillance on the Highly Pathogenic Avian

Influenza continued.

The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic

Resources Development (MFARD) took

measures to increase fish production for

both local consumption and export purposes,

while providing for the welfare of the fishing

community and ensuring compliance with

international regulations. Ensuring the

long-term availability of fish and securing access

to export markets depend crucially on curbing

over-fishing and harmful fishing practices.

Therefore, the MFARD undertook numerous

measures to implement safeguards and enforce

rules and regulations to ensure the long-term

viability of the fishing industry. The MFARD

banned the use of the “light-course fishing method”

(using a strong light underwater to attract fish) in

December 2017 and conducted raids with the

Sri Lanka Navy throughout the year to prevent

using dynamite blasting methods to catch fish.

The MFARD spent Rs. 78 million to distribute

2,328 e-logbooks to multi-day fishing vessels to

record fishing details, enabling the monitoring

of fishing activities, with the view to curb over-

fishing. The MFARD plans to introduce fishing

gear with special devices that will ensure dolphins

are not caught into fishing nets, to comply with

international laws. Meanwhile, preliminary work

to establish an ornamental fish breeding centre in

Puttalam was completed during the year, which

aims to breed such fish for export purposes. The

MFARD also undertook measures to amend the

Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fisheries Boats)

Act No. 59 of 1979 to increase penalties on foreign

boats fishing in Sri Lankan waters illegally. The

amendments when enacted, would curb foreign

fishermen entering Sri Lankan seas illegally and

using harmful practices such as bottom-trawling

that damage breeding and feeding habitats of fish.

The MFARD also ensured that 68 approved facilities

and eight accredited testing laboratories that are

engaged in processing fish for export purposes

are functioning under the appropriate standards.

The MFARD undertook a number of infrastructure

development projects to support the fishing

industry in Sri Lanka and uplift the living standards

of fishing communities. Construction of fisheries

harbours, upgrading of harbours and construction

of an anchorage progressed in 2017. To reduce

post-harvest losses, the MFARD conducted

training and awareness building campaigns for

fishermen and upgraded 100 multi-day fishing

vessels with mechanical line hauling and better

cold storage facilities under a subsidised scheme,

while improving landing sites in fishing villages and

providing free storage facilities. In order to uplift

the welfare of the fishing communities and to assist

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

60

those affected by adverse weather conditions,

the MFARD undertook various initiatives which

included the construction and renovation of

houses, disbursing loans and provision of

boats and fishing gear. The Northern Province

Sustainable Fishery Development programme

was carried out with Asian Development Bank

funds. Meanwhile, under the “Wewak Samaga

Gamak” programme that commenced in 2016,

Rs. 251.8 million was released to the District

Secretariats for 168 projects.

The NAQDA implemented various initiatives

to support food security and nutrition levels of

Sri Lankans, while protecting and developing

Sri Lanka’s aquaculture resources. Continuing

with the efforts taken in 2016 to rehabilitate the

shrimp and prawn industry, which has been

affected by the ‘white spots disease’, the NAQDA

undertook further measures in 2017, such as

dredging of the Dutch Canal, introduction of a

crop calendar and zoning, regulation of shrimp

hatcheries, screening of post larvae of shrimp and

broodstock, and provision of services to farmers

through the Shrimp Disease Diagnosis and

Health Management Laboratory in Battuluoya.

Meanwhile, a freshwater prawn breeding centre

was established in Kallar, Trincomalee in 2017

to increase the supply of freshwater prawn and

provide higher income avenues to the rural

community. The NAQDA undertook the planning

work on the Aquaculture Industrial Park in Mannar

as proposed in the Budget 2017 and establishing

crab cities in Hambantota and Batticaloa. Two

Aquaculture Development Centres set up by

the NAQDA in Udawalawe and Muruthawela

commenced operations in 2017, supplying

fish seed for stocking in the reservoirs in the

surrounding areas. Meanwhile, the construction of

another similar centre in Sevanapitiya continued

during 2017. Under the ‘Food Production National

Programme 2016-2018’, the NAQDA renovated

four Thilapia aquaculture development centres.

Construction of a Freshwater Fish Genetic

Development Center in Dambulla commenced

in 2017 in order to develop new strains of

indigenous species such as Lula and Walaya

and to produce high quality broodstock. Further,

the NAQDA commenced the establishment of an

ornamental fish farm in Polonnaruwa where there

are already about 650 ornamental fish farming

ponds to provide quality seeds and parent stocks.

Meanwhile, operations in the multi-species

marine finfish hatchery in Batticaloa commenced.

Since Sri Lanka is currently importing all fish bait

necessary for tuna fishing, measures were taken

to design a milk fish hatchery in Puttalam in 2017

that will grow bait fish required for tuna fishing. In

order to support the production of fish specifically

for the export market, the NAQDA commenced

the construction of a sea cucumber hatchery and

a sea bass breeding unit under public-private

partnership and provided technical support to

breed mud-crabs.

Industry

The value added of Industry activities

grew by 3.9 per cent in 2017, compared to

5.8 per cent growth in 2016. The growth during

2017 was mainly driven by the expansion in

manufacturing activities. Meanwhile, the growth in

construction, and mining and quarrying activities

witnessed a slowdown during the year, in comparison

to the higher growth observed in the previous year.

The other Industry activities, electricity related

activities, sewerage, waste treatment and disposal

activities, and water collection, treatment and supply

activities continued to register positive growth during

the year, compared to the previous year.

Mining and Quarrying

Mining and quarrying activities grew at

a slower rate of 5.9 per cent in 2017, in value

added terms, compared to 14.4 per cent growth

in 2016. The moderation observed in construction

activities adversely affected the growth in mining

and quarrying activities to a certain extent during

the year. Gem exports contracted in volume terms,

while the production of phosphate and graphite

also recorded a contraction in 2017 which had a

negative impact towards the growth in mining and

quarrying activities. However, the production of

mineral sands grew significantly during the year

with the contribution from the positive growth

recorded in the production of ilmenite, rutile and

zircon. This was also reflected in the change in the

mineral exports volume index, which increased by

18.8 per cent in 2017, compared to the increase of

7.9 per cent in 2016.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing activities grew by

3.9 per cent, in value added terms, in 2017,

compared to 3.2 per cent growth in 2016. The

expansion in the manufacture of textiles, wearing

apparel and leather related products, which grew

by 5.7 per cent in 2017 compared to 1.8 per cent

growth in 2016, mainly contributed to this growth.

The favourable impact of the reinstatement of

GSP+ stimulated the expansion in the manufacture

of textiles, wearing apparel and leather related

products, particularly during the second half

of the year. Further, the manufacture of food,

beverages and tobacco products, which grew by

1.5 per cent in 2017, recovering from 0.2 per cent

contraction recorded in the previous year, also

supported the growth in this segment. Moreover,

all the other manufacturing categories, except for

the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum

products, and manufacture of wood and of products

of wood and cork except furniture, contributed

positively to the overall growth in manufacturing

activities. Meanwhile, the Index of Industrial

Production (IIP, 2015=100) compiled by the DCS

was also increased indicating an expansion in

manufacturing activities. Further, the Purchasing

Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing activities

compiled on a monthly basis by the CBSL also

indicated an expansion in manufacturing activities

during the year.

Index of Industrial Production

Index of Industrial Production3 (IIP) recorded

an increase of 2.5 per cent during 2017, a

slightly lower growth than the 3.3 per cent

recorded in 2016. The favourable performance

of export oriented products, such as wearing

apparel, textiles, rubber and plastic products and

electrical equipment was supported by improved

global demand and gradual recovery of global

commodity prices, amidst natural disasters and

geopolitical tensions in some countries. Food,

It is based on International Standard Industrial Classification - Rev. 4 with the base year 2015. Accordingly, the analysis of the manufacturing sector from 2017 onwards is based on the IIP instead of the Factory Industry Production Index, which was compiled by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

other non-metallic mineral products, basic metals

and fabricated metal products, which are largely

focused on meeting the domestic demand, also

facilitated the growth in the IIP despite supply

side disturbances triggered by adverse weather

conditions during the year. Nevertheless, output of

beverages, coke and refined petroleum products,

and chemical and chemical products declined

during the period.

Manufacturing of food products, which

has the largest share in the IIP registered an

increase of 3.3 per cent during 2017, compared

with the 1.7 per cent expansion recorded in

2016. Increase in the production of wheat flour,

biscuits, ice cream and milk powder, driven by

increased consumer demand was the key factor

behind this performance. Production of milk powder

increased largely due to the increase in capacity by

a key producer in the industry. The manufacturing

of beverages, which recorded a growth of

3.6 per cent in 2016, declined by 11.7 per cent in

2017, driven by the drop in arrack production. The

production of beverages is expected to be further

affected by the excise duty imposed on sweetened

beverages and liquor in the Budget 2018. The food

processing and beverages industry is an important

sector in the Sri Lankan economy, being a major

contributor for uplifting the agricultural sector with

its direct and indirect links, generating employment

as well as promoting the health of the nation. The

food and beverages sector offers significant growth

opportunities, with the increased preference

globally and locally for healthy food products with

less sugar, fat and salt and more natural ingredients,

and organic food. Sri Lanka possesses many

traditional and herbal food/beverage varieties and

agricultural cultivation practices that could cater

to this growing market. Thus, local manufactures

should strive to capitalise on these strengths, whilst

complying with global quality standards in the food

processing and beverage industry, in order to fully

harness the emerging and evolving opportunities in

the industry.

Based on the IIP, the manufacturing of

wearing apparel grew by 4.7 per cent in 2017,

against the 5.7 per cent growth of the previous

year. Increased exports to the European Union

(EU), following the restoration of the EU GSP+

facility in May 2017, as well as to the USA, Canada

and other non-traditional markets facilitated this

growth. Production of textiles on the other hand,

reflected a growth of 2.3 per cent in 2017, lower

than the 4.0 per cent growth reported in 2016.

This growth was mainly driven by the enhanced

production of finished fabrics and printed fabrics,

particularly during the second half of 2017.

Meanwhile, a healthy demand for local textiles from

the USA, Kenya, Turkey and Vietnam supported

this expansion. Apparel and textile manufacturing

is a fast moving dynamic industry. With a variety

of factors affecting the success of the industry,

productivity enhancement to face price competition,

market intelligence for fast responsiveness to

rapidly changing customer preferences, product

and design development are some of the decisive

factors that can contribute towards the growth in

the sector. Growing popularity of online sales

platforms and increasing demand for ‘fast fashion’

are challenging the entire supply chain in terms of

speed and flexibility. At the same time, sustainable

manufacturing is gaining prominence in supply

chains, from sourcing to product distribution, to

make the global value chain more eco-friendly.

However, increasing labour costs, amidst the

scarcity of labour has become a challenge for local

industry. Thus, investing in technology, automation

and robotics will support the industry to remain

competitive in the global market.

Production of other non-metallic mineral

products recorded a considerable expansion

of 6.5 per cent in 2017, further to the

4.7 per cent growth in the previous year.

Increased production of construction materials,

such as cement, roofing tiles, wall tiles and floor

tiles during the first half of the year, fuelled by

growth in construction activities in recent times

supported this positive performance. At the same

time, there was a higher domestic as well as export

demand, mainly from India, the USA and Australia,

for glass and glassware during the year. However,

lower production of cement, roofing tiles, wall tiles

and floor tiles during the last quarter of 2017 led

to a negative growth in the manufacturing of other

non-metallic mineral products during the second

half of 2017. The trend towards replacing metals

and plastic with glass and ceramic will create a high

demand for cost effective high quality glass and

ceramic based products. Sri Lanka, as a producer

of high quality glass and ceramic products, has the

potential to further expand in the global market. But

Sri Lanka’s competitiveness is challenged by high

energy costs and therefore, to remain competitive

in the international market, it is necessary to

adopt energy efficient and environmental friendly

technologies. At the same time, the industry can

also focus on a niche market with consumer

oriented unique products and designs.

Manufacturing of coke and refined petroleum

products declined by 4.8 per cent during 2017

in comparison to the drop of 0.9 per cent in

2016. Refinery activities of Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation was disrupted by several operational

constraints, leading to a temporary shutdown of the

refinery. However, improved refinery efficiency due

to renovations resulted in a higher output during

the last quarter of 2017.

Manufacturing of rubber and plastic products

increased by 4.2 per cent in 2017, over the

growth of 3.7 per cent in 2016. A considerable

increase in the production of rubber tyres was

witnessed during the period, largely supported by

improved exports to the USA, Canada, Brazil and

European markets as well as the local market. In

addition, the expansion in the production of rubber

gloves during 2017 can be attributed to higher

export demand, particularly from the USA, Brazil,

India and Canada. Sri Lankan rubber products have

earned a reputation for high quality and reliability in

the global market and has the potential to make

further contributions towards the generation

of foreign exchange revenue and employment

opportunities in the country. Currently, the sector

faces several challenges such as higher cost of

labour, lack of skilled labour and low productivity.

Thus, to remain competitive in the global market

in a sustainable manner, it is necessary to take

measures to progress towards the high-end of the

value chain whilst complying with global standards.

To this end, it is vital to invest considerably on new

technology and research and development, while

improving productivity and value addition, with the

aim of building a global brand for Sri Lankan rubber

based products.

Production of chemicals and chemical

products contracted by 7.2 per cent, compared

to the growth of 4.2 per cent in 2016. This was

largely due to the significant decline in fertiliser

processing that may be linked to lower demand

for fertiliser, owing to lower agriculture activity

due to adverse weather conditions that prevailed

during the year. At the same time, manufacturing

of paints too reported a large drop, dampening

the growth in the manufacturing of chemicals and

chemical products. Hence, the domestic demand

for paints was largely met through imports.

Manufacturing of basic metals witnessed

a growth of 11.7 per cent in 2017, compared

to the expansion of 8.1 per cent reported

during the previous year. Increased production

of lead, aluminium extruded products, aluminium

bars and steel bars fuelled this enhanced

output. Furthermore, fabricated metal products

too showed a higher output, with a growth of

16.7 per cent, compared to the negative growth

of 0.7 per cent in 2016. Higher demand from

construction activities provided impetus for this

improved performance.

Production of electrical equipment

recovered from its weak performance in 2016,

recording a growth of 1.7 per cent, against

the negative growth of 1.8 per cent in the

previous year. An increase in the production

of electric panel boards, transformers and

transformer related components was observed

during the period, which was facilitated by

a considerable increase in the exports of

machinery and mechanical appliances to India,

Germany, the UK and the USA during the year.

However, the growth decelerated during the last

quarter of 2017, largely due to a decrease in the

manufacturing of coil devices, transformers and

heavy cables.

Manufacturing of tobacco products

increased by 1.2 per cent compared to the

slightly higher growth of 5.1 per cent in

2016. Production of cigarettes experienced a

considerable setback during the first half of the

year, which could be attributed to lower consumer

demand, led by increased cigarette prices due

to higher taxes since 2016. However, increased

production of tobacco based products, largely

to the export market, during the second half of

2017 generated a growth in the manufacturing of

tobacco products.

Industrial Policies and Institutional Support

The government implemented diverse

initiatives targeting the development of

physical and regulatory infrastructure,

funding sources, market access and technical

know-how to support manufacturing

industries. The Budget for 2017 contained

measures to build competencies of micro, small

and medium enterprises (MSMEs), attract

foreign direct investment, develop export focused

industries and support research and development.

Further, the Budget 2018 placed prominence on

manufacturing industries by choosing “Enterprise

Sri Lanka” as one of the themes. Importantly, it

was announced that entrepreneurship and skill

building must start from the primary school level

and a host of measures were introduced to gear

Sri Lanka’s education policy towards promoting

well-balanced, innovative and productive citizens

who can support high-quality manufacturing

industries and drive economic growth in the

long-term. While various Ministries and institutions

under their purview strived to implement most of

the policies introduced through the Budget 2017,

some vital proposals to ensure long-term viability

of the industry sector remained unimplemented,

which highlights the need for strong governance

and accountability mechanisms on operationalising

the important policy actions announced to the

public by the government.

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce

(MIC) together with the institutions under

its purview implemented policy measures

to support industries and promote

manufactured exports. Initiatives aimed at

improving manufacturing capacity included the

commencement of the development of a 200-acre

Techno Super Zone in Raigama, which will be

dedicated to consumer and technological products.

The Ministry also planned to establish industrial

estates (IEs) in Welioya, Batticoloa and Musali to

provide incentives for private sector investors to

invest in rural areas which were affected by war.

Meanwhile, the Industrial Development Board

(IDB) under the MIC implemented measures

to upgrade the infrastructure facilities in the

29 existing IEs. Having identified the importance of

supporting the food and beverage industry, which

is the largest manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka

with proper regulations, the MIC completed the

Accredited Food Laboratory and supported small

industries in the food sector to obtain the Good

Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.

The Budget 2017 allocated Rs. 500 million to

revitalise the textile and handloom industry by

providing infrastructure through the IDB. Under

the “Economic Empowerment of Women through

the Mini-Factories” project, establishing 150 mini

apparel factories were completed in selected

districts during 2017. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka

Institute of Textile and Apparel conducted research

into innovative products such as the banana-yarn

industry.

The Board of Investment (BOI), which

functions under the Ministry of Development

Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT),

continued to play an important role in facilitating

foreign and local investment for manufacturing

industries. The “single window investment

facilitation taskforce” provided necessary linkages

to the relevant line agencies to expedite the project

approving process, through a function based

virtual platform. During 2017, the BOI identified

target sectors for attracting FDIs and to generate

export revenue through a study conducted in

collaboration with the Harvard University’s Centre

for International Development and the World

Bank. Based on the study, high value added and

technologically intensive goods such as automotive

components, medical devices, pharmaceuticals,

solar panels, fabricated metal parts, value added

minerals, smart textiles, niche apparels, processed

fish, sea-food, fruits, vegetables and dairy products

have been identified as potential industries from

the manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, the BOI

designed plans to develop export processing zones

in Bingiriya, Matara and Milleniya in 2017.

The government carried out targeted policy

measures to support the Micro, Small and

Medium Industries through improving access to

finance, training and development, provision of

market intelligence and product development.

The National Enterprise Development Authority

(NEDA), which is under the MIC, commenced

compiling a database on MSMEs, while

implementing a number of programmes to enhance

productivity, market access, and technical skills

of MSMEs. Further, the National Craft Council

registered handicraft manufacturers and provided

training and development on technical aspects

as well as market access and entrepreneurial

skills to uplift the sector. Meanwhile, the Ministry

of Finance and Mass Media together with the

Asian Development Bank (ADB) took initial

steps towards implementing a ‘National Credit

Guarantee Scheme’ to provide guarantees for

loans obtained by SMEs and a Venture Capital

Fund to improve equity funding for SMEs, with the

objective of enhancing access to finance. Further,

an Environmental Clearance Policy for SME

lending through refinance loan schemes to promote

environmental friendly products and energy

conservation was introduced while coordinating

12 other loan schemes proposed in the Budget

2017 to increase the availability of low cost finance

for SMEs. Meanwhile, the National Productivity

Secretariat implemented training programmes that

build awareness on methods to increase efficiency

in business processes to support MSMEs.

The government took measures to equip

the labour force with necessary knowledge

and skills to work in the manufacturing sector.

The Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational

Training (MSDVT) took various measures to

improve technical and vocational training activities

and to address the acute labour shortage issue

in manufacturing and construction industries.

The MSDVT implemented a linked employment

programme, with the private sector as proposed

in the Budget 2017, to provide a monthly stipend

of Rs. 10,000 for three months to train students in

private sector manufacturing firms, while granting

other scholarships to students enrolled in vocational

training institutions.

The government took initiatives to invest

in research and development projects by

partnering with the private sector to promote

research and development activities in the

manufacturing sector. The Ministry of Science,

Technology and Research (MSTR) together with the

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

67

Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology

and Innovation (COSTI), carried out the “Innovating

Sri Lanka” programme launched in 2016. Further,

the MSTR and the COSTI engaged in the planning

process to establish the “Biotechnology Innovation

Park”, which was proposed in the Budget

2017. The Sri Lanka Institute of Biotechnology

Research will be a state of the art one stop shop

for companies in the medical field, agriculture

sector, the manufacturing sector and bio-energy

generation. The MSTR and the COSTI carried

out plans to establish the Centre of Excellence

in Robotics Applications, which is to operate

under the IDB. Under the Mechatronics Enabled

Economic Development Initiative, the government

approved the establishment of a ‘Product Design

Engineering and Manufacturing Park’ in 2017,

which will include a ‘Standard Prototyping and

Testing Facility’ to be managed by the National

Engineering Research and Development Centre

for use by the private sector. The Sri Lanka

Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC), carried

out the activities to set up the ‘Technology Transfer

Unit’ to commercialise some of the research

findings during 2017. As per the Memorandum of

Understanding signed between the SLINTEC and

the Export Development Board (EDB), a SLINTEC

Satellite Unit was set up in the EDB premises and

“science clinics” were conducted for exporters.

The SLINTEC also established the “Academy of

the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology” in 2017

as a private non-profit postgraduate institute, with

the aim of increasing the research output through

the research undertaken as a part of postgraduate

study programmes, while making greater use of the

sophisticated laboratory equipment at SLINTEC.

Some of the research projects of SLINTEC for 2017

included hybrid fertiliser that uses locally produced

compost, wound dressing material that uses honey,

nano-fertiliser for paddy fields with specific soil types

and extraction of titanium from ilmenite. Further,

the MSTR finalised the operational framework

to implement the “Innovation Accelerator Fund”

proposed in the Budget 2017.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) and

the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) engaged

in new product development and process

innovations, and supported MSMEs with

technological enhancements. The NSF prepared

technical reports on solid waste management

and indigenous scientific knowledge and granted

financial support for researchers working in the

fields of small and medium sized boat building,

Sri Lankan cinnamon, food security, impact of

natural disasters, etc. Two patents were granted in

2017 for research funded by the NSF. Meanwhile,

collaborative research programmes were initiated in

2017 with Pakistan, China and Japan and joint calls

for research proposals were issued on Sri Lanka's

vital research issues. The ITI embarked on an

Indo-Sri Lanka Joint Research Programme on

spices while signing an agreement to establish a joint

laboratory on biotechnology to conduct research

with a Chinese Science and Technology institution.

The ITI also undertook new product development

in 2017 in numerous areas such as digital humidity

and temperature monitoring, Sri Lankan flora,

the dengue virus, contaminated wastewater, tea,

rubber, graphite, paper, pesticides, instant food

products, rabies vaccine for animals, equipment for

cereal dehydration, and red-clay based products,

and carried out joint research with private sector

enterprises in these fields.

The National Gem and Jewellery Authority

(NGJA) strived to improve the quality standards

of the gem and jewellery industry. The NGJA

introduced compulsory jewellery hallmarking and

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

68

built awareness among the industry players on

computer aided designing and computer aided

manufacturing while training lapidaries. The NGJA

also improved the gem testing and certification

laboratory and introduced a mobile laboratory

that visits various geographical areas where gem

transactions are common, to assist customers to

identify genuine gems and issue gem certificates.

Since the government allowed the importation of

gems to Sri Lanka for value addition and export, the

NGJA took part in developing necessary diplomatic

strategies.

Trade and Industry Chambers and

Associations continued to support and facilitate

the industry sector by being a collective voice

in lobbying with the government, conducting

training programmes, building awareness on

new developments and regulations, organising

trade exhibitions and facilitating trade

delegations. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce

and the National Chamber of Commerce

conducted the “meet the Ambassador” programme

for industrialists to explore trade opportunities with

foreign countries. These chambers undertook

training programmes, organised exhibitions,

provided policy suggestions to the government and

facilitated large companies to link up with smaller

companies that can provide inputs. The Sri Lanka

Food Processors’ Association held the annual

international food, beverage and agricultural

packaging exhibition called “Pro Food Pro Pack”

in Sri Lanka in 2017 and organised a seminar on

“Export Food Trade” with the Institute of Food

Science and Technology. The Association also

supported training programmes for testing and

laboratory officers of the Sri Lankan Standards

Institute for testing of food, to ensure compliance

with ISO certifications. The Sri Lanka Chamber of

Small and Medium Industries (SLCSMI) conducted

a project with the assistance of the ADB, aimed at

building the capacity of SMEs for strengthening the

export value chains through cluster development

and cluster financing. The SLCSMI took measures

to convey concerns faced due to foreign competition

by footwear manufacturers, manufacturers of

adhesives and water-proofing materials and textile

manufacturers to relevant authorities. Further, the

SLCSMI initiated the “Mentor on Road Project”

by selecting 600 micro and small enterprises to

equip them with low cost tools for national and

global marketing and to encourage them to access

broader national and global markets.

Electricity, Water and Waste Treatment

The value added of electricity, water and

waste treatment activities grew by 3.9 per cent

in 2017, albeit at a slower rate, compared to

10.1 per cent growth in 2016. Being the main

contributor towards the growth in this category,

electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply

activities, grew at a slower pace of 2.7 per cent in

2017, compared to 8.4 per cent growth in 2016.

This moderation was also reflected in the slower

growth of 3.7 per cent in total electricity generation

in 2017, compared to 8.1 per cent growth in 2016.

Moreover, hydropower generation contracted by

12.1 per cent in 2017, compared to 29.0 per cent

contraction in 2016, due to the prolonged drought

that prevailed in the catchment areas, particularly

during the first half of the year. Therefore, fuel

oil and coal based power generation expanded

during the year to meet the electricity demand.

Accordingly, fuel oil based power generation grew

by 13.1 per cent in 2017 compared to 96.0 per cent

growth in 2016, while coal based power generation

grew by 1.1 per cent in 2017, in comparison to

13.6 per cent growth observed in 2016. The water

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

69

collection, treatment and supply activities expanded

by 4.6 per cent in 2017, compared to 7.9 per cent

expansion in 2016, which was also reflected in

3.0 per cent increase in the units of water distributed

by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board

(NWS&DB) in 2017, compared to 12.0 per cent

growth in 2016. Further, the number of consumer

accounts of the NWS&DB grew by 6.1 per cent

in 2017, compared to 7.1 per cent growth in

2016. Meanwhile, the sewerage, waste treatment

and disposal activities grew at a slower rate of

7.9 per cent in 2017, compared to the growth of

17.8 per cent in 2016.

Construction

The value added of construction activities

grew by 3.1 per cent in 2017, yet at a slower

pace, compared to 8.3 per cent growth in

2016. This slowdown in construction activities

was reflected in cement production and imports,

which grew at slower rates of 4.6 per cent and

7.1 per cent, respectively, in 2017, compared to

the respective growth rates of 17.8 per cent and

29.5 per cent in 2016. It collectively recorded

a 6.3 per cent growth in 2017, compared to

25.3 per cent growth in 2016. Further, the building

material imports volume index, which increased

by 22.9 per cent in 2016, recorded an increase

of 6.8 per cent in 2017, indicating a moderate

performance in construction activities. In the

meantime, the realised growth in construction

activities was supported by the infrastructure

projects, and large scale residential and mixed

development projects. Meanwhile, the growth

in credit extended to the private sector for

construction activities by Licensed Commercial

Banks (LCBs) slowed down to 22.5 per cent

as at end December 2017, compared to

26.9 per cent growth recorded as at end

December 2016. Further, credit granted for

personal housing construction activities by LCBs

grew by 22.3 per cent as at end December

2017, reflecting the private sector involvement in

construction activities.

Services

The Services related economic activities

expanded by 3.2 per cent in 2017, in value added

terms, compared to 4.7 per cent growth in 2016.

The growth in Services activities during the year

was largely backed by the expansion in financial

services activities together with the developments

in wholesale and retail trade activities. Further,

the growth in other personal services, real estate

activities, human health activities, transportation,

accommodation services, professional services,

insurance, telecommunication, education and IT

related activities contributed positively towards the

expansion in Services activities. However, public

administration services contracted during the

year. Meanwhile, the PMI for Services activities,

compiled by the CBSL on a monthly basis, also

denoted an expansion in Services activities

throughout the year.

Wholesale and Retail Trade

The value added of wholesale and

retail trade activities continued its growth

momentum, recording a 3.8 per cent growth

in 2017, compared to 2.5 per cent growth in

2016 largely reflected by the expansion in

external trade, amidst the decline in domestic

agricultural related trade particularly due to

the severe drought conditions that prevailed

during the year. This expansion during the year

was also reflected in the movements of import

and export trade volume indices. Accordingly,

the import volume index increased by

7.7 per cent in 2017, compared to 7.0 per cent

increase in 2016. The importation of consumer

goods and intermediate goods increased during

the year, while investment goods registered a

marginal decline. Accordingly, the consumer goods

imports volume index increased by 6.9 per cent in

2017 against 12.0 per cent decline in 2016, which

was largely backed by the significant increase in

food and beverages imports, to compensate for

the decline in domestic agriculture production, as

a result of severe drought conditions that prevailed

in the major cultivation areas. Meanwhile,

the intermediate goods imports volume index

increased by 10.7 per cent in 2017, compared

to 10.8 per cent increase in 2016. However, the

investment goods imports volume index declined

marginally by 0.1 per cent in 2017 largely due

to the contraction in machinery and equipment

imports. Meanwhile, the exports volume index

increased by 7.6 per cent in 2017 against the

marginal decline of 0.7 per cent in 2016, mainly

driven by the industrial exports, which registered

a substantial increase of 7.9 per cent in 2017,

in comparison to 0.4 per cent increase in 2016.

Further, the notable recovery in agricultural

exports, particularly due to the significant growth

in spices and seafood exports, in comparison to

the significant contraction observed in 2016, also

supported this growth.

Transportation and Storage

The value added of transportation of goods

and passengers, including warehousing

activities, grew by 0.9 per cent in 2017, albeit at

a slower rate, compared to 5.5 per cent growth

in 2016. The passenger kilometers operated by

transport services witnessed a slowdown during

the year, reflecting a moderation in transport

activities. Accordingly, the passenger kilometers

operated by the Sri Lanka Transport Board and

the private sector bus operators contracted by

1.8 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively, in

2017, compared to the respective growth rates of

6.1 per cent and 2.0 per cent in 2016. However,

the passenger kilometers operated by the

Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) grew by 1.1 per cent in

2017 compared to 0.1 per cent marginal growth

in 2016. Further, the total passenger kilometers

flown by Srilankan Airlines increased at a higher

rate of 8.8 per cent in 2017, compared to

0.8 per cent growth in 2016. Meanwhile, the

container traffic (Twenty Foot Equivalent

Units - TEUs) and cargo handled by Sri Lankan

ports grew by 8.3 per cent and 8.5 per cent,

respectively, in 2017, in comparison to respective

growth rates of 10.6 per cent and 11.5 per cent

in 2016. Moreover, the freight ton kilometers

transported by SLR increased by 3.5 per cent in

2017, compared to 7.6 per cent growth in 2016.

In the meantime, the freight ton kilometers flown

by Srilankan Airlines grew by 9.8 per cent in

2017, in comparison to the same growth in 2016.

Meanwhile, the growth of postal and courier

activities moderated during the year, recording a

growth of 3.9 per cent in 2017, compared to the

growth of 5.1 per cent in 2016.

Accommodation and Food Service Activities

The accommodation, food and beverage

service activities increased by 5.0 per cent

in value added terms in 2017, compared to

4.0 per cent growth in 2016. This expansion

during the year was supported by tourism related

activities, reflecting an increase in tourist arrivals

by 3.2 per cent in 2017 despite the partial closure of

the Bandaranaike International Airport during the

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

71

first quarter of the year. Western Europe, where

the spending power of tourists is relatively high,

recorded the highest number of tourist arrivals as

a region during the year. Meanwhile, the room

occupancy rate in graded hotel establishments

approved by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development

Authority (SLTDA) declined marginally to

73.3 per cent in 2017, in comparison to

74.8 per cent in 2016. Further, the earnings

from tourism activities increased to US dollars

3.6 billion, with a growth of 3.2 per cent during

the year. The growing demand for restaurants

and hotels facilities, as reflected by the increase

in private consumption expenditure also

contributed to the growth in accommodation and

food services.

Information and Communication

The value added of information and

communication activities grew by 10.2

per cent in 2017, compared to 8.0 per

cent growth in 2016. The growth during the

year was largely driven by the expansion

in telecommunication activities, which grew

by 12.0 per cent in 2017, in comparison to

8.3 per cent growth in 2016. Considering the

growth in total telephone connections, the

cellular subscribers and fixed access wireline

connections increased continuously, whilst

fixed access wireless connections recovered,

registering a positive growth during the year.

Further, email and internet services of both

fixed and mobile broadband categories grew at

a higher rate, reflecting the growing demand for

internet services of the economy. Meanwhile, IT

programming consultancy and related activities

expanded by 4.2 per cent in 2017, compared to

7.1 per cent expansion in 2016. Further,

programming and broadcasting, and audio/video

production activities grew by 13.2 per cent in

2017, compared to 7.9 per cent growth in 2016.

Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Activities including Ownership of Dwellings

The financial, insurance and real estate

activities including ownership of dwellings

expanded by 7.0 per cent in 2017, in value

added terms, compared to 9.2 per cent

growth in 2016. The financial service activities

and auxiliary financial services, which grew by

9.4 per cent in 2017, compared to 12.3 per cent growth

in 2016 primarily contributed to this growth. In this

regard, the gross loans and advances in banks and

non-bank financial institutions grew by 16.1 per

cent and 10.2 per cent, respectively, in 2017,

in comparison to the respective growth rates of

17.5 per cent and 20.1 per cent in 2016. Further,

the deposit base of banks and non-bank

financial institutions grew by 17.5 per cent and

29.4 per cent, respectively, in 2017, compared

to the respective growth rates of 16.5 per cent

and 10.4 per cent in 2016. Accordingly, the total

loans and deposit base of the banking industry

and non-bank financial institutions grew by

16.8 per cent in 2017, compared to 17.0 per cent

growth in 2016. Meanwhile, real estate activities

including ownership of dwellings grew by 4.7 per

cent in 2017, compared to 6.3 per cent growth in

2016. In the meantime, the insurance, reinsurance

and pension funding activities expanded by

5.7 per cent in 2017, in comparison to

8.5 per cent growth in 2016. The premiums earned

by the insurance industry in 2017 increased by

12.2 per cent, while claims incurred contracted

marginally by 1.7 per cent. In comparison, premiums

earned and claims incurred in 2016 increased by

18.2 per cent and 19.4 per cent, respectively.

Professional Services and Other Personal Service Activities

The professional services and other

personal service activities grew at a higher

rate of 3.3 per cent in 2017, in comparison to

0.9 per cent growth in 2016. The other personal

service activities, being the major contributor to the

segment, continued to expand during the year by

3.2 per cent compared to 1.3 per cent growth in

2016. Meanwhile, professional, scientific, technical,

administration and support service activities, which

include the services that require professional

expertise, grew by 4.3 per cent in 2017, recovering

from 1.3 per cent contraction in 2016 and supported

the expansion in the segment.

Public Administration, Defence, Education, Human Health and Social Work Activities

The growth in public administration,

defence, education, human health and social

work activities contracted by 1.2 per cent in

2017 against the 4.9 per cent growth in 2016.

This setback was largely attributable to the

contraction of 4.8 per cent in 2017 compared to

the expansion of 5.2 per cent in 2016 in public

administration, defence and compulsory social

security activities, which account for the largest

share of the segment. However, human health

activities, residential care and social work activities

recorded a significant expansion by registering a

growth of 7.2 per cent in 2017, in comparison to

1.5 per cent growth in 2016. Meanwhile, the growth

of education services slowed down to 0.5 per cent

in 2017 from 7.5 per cent growth in 2016.

Developments in Economic Activities as reflected through Business Outlook Survey

Business Outlook Survey, which is a forward

looking survey conducted by the CBSL on a

quarterly basis, targeting large scale business

entities, covering Agriculture, Industry and

Services activities, also reflected subdued

business conditions during the year. In fact,

the Business Condition Index compiled through

this survey remained below neutral level of 100

throughout the year indicating a deterioration in

business condition. Moreover, policy inconsistencies,

labour market imbalances and high interest rates

were identified as major constraints to fast-track

business activities. However, outlook for the first

quarter of 2018 indicates an improvement mainly

supported by the recovery in Agriculture activities.

2.5 Expenditure

On the expenditure front, the Gross

Domestic Expenditure (GDE), which consists

of the total consumption and investment

expenditure of the economy, expanded

by 11.5 per cent in 2017 compared to

8.5 per cent growth in 2016 and was estimated

at Rs. 14,247.7 billion at current market prices

during the year. The growth in both consumption

and investment expenditure contributed towards the

expansion in GDE. The consumption expenditure,

which grew at 3.1 per cent in 2016, grew by

increase in both imports volume and value indices

was mainly driven by the increase in consumer and

intermediate goods imports particularly owing to

the severe drought conditions that prevailed in the

country, while investment goods imports witnessed

some slowdown. With respect to exports, all major

export categories including industrial, agricultural

and mineral exports volume and value indices

increased during the year. Consequently, the

GDP at current market prices, which is the total

demand for final goods produced in the economy,

that consists of GDE and the net external demand,

expanded by 11.6 per cent at current market prices,

amounting to Rs. 13,289.5 billion in 2017, where as

at constant prices, it grew by 3.1 per cent.

Consumption

The growth in consumption expenditure

accelerated by 9.0 per cent at current market

prices in 2017, in comparison to 3.1 per cent

growth in 2016, accounting for a 70.7 per cent

share of aggregate expenditure of the economy.

In comparison to the slowdown witnessed in total

consumption expenditure in the previous year,

it gathered momentum during 2017 contributed

9.0 per cent in 2017, while investment expenditure

showed some slowdown from 22.0 per cent growth

in 2016 to 16.6 per cent growth in 2017. At constant

prices, the GDE grew by 6.8 per cent in 2017,

compared to 6.3 per cent growth in 2016. The

consumption expenditure at constant prices grew

at a marginal rate of 0.6 per cent when compared

to a higher growth at current market prices in

2017, reflecting the increased price levels of the

economy. Meanwhile, investment expenditure

grew by 17.2 per cent in 2017 at constant prices,

in comparison to 27.1 per cent growth in 2016.

Meanwhile, net external demand worsened further,

recording a contraction of 9.6 per cent in current

market prices in 2017 compared to the contraction

of 6.0 per cent in 2016, reflecting the significant

increase in the import of goods and services, in

comparison to the growth in the export of goods

and services in rupee terms. Moreover, at constant

prices, the rupee value of exports and imports grew

by 7.5 per cent and 19.3 per cent, respectively, in

2017, resulting in a further deterioration of the net

external demand. In view of the trade indices, a

similar increasing trend could be observed in both

exports and imports volume and value indices. The

PCE on food and non-alcoholic beverages,

the largest expenditure category of PCE, grew

at a higher rate of 5.4 per cent in 2017 at current

market prices as against the 2.5 per cent

contraction observed in 2016. This expansion

was also reflected in the food and beverages

imports value index in rupee terms, which increased

by 18.4 per cent in 2017, compared to 7.3 per cent

increase in 2016. Further, this was also mirrored

by the rebound in the food and beverages imports

volume index, which increased by 18.2 per cent

in 2017, against 3.1 per cent decline in 2016.

The growth of PCE, on food and non-alcoholic

beverages at current market prices, was partly

driven by higher price levels, as reflected by the

increased food inflation based on the National

Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013 = 100), which

increased at a higher rate of 11.3 per cent in 2017,

compared to 3.1 per cent in 2016. However, the

share of the food and non-alcoholic beverages

category in PCE, marginally declined to 29.1 per

cent in 2017 from 30.0 per cent in 2016.

by increased consumption in both private and

government sectors. The private consumption

expenditure (PCE) that accounts for 88.0 per cent of

total consumption expenditure grew at a higher rate

of 8.7 per cent in 2017, compared to 3.1 per cent

growth in 2016. This expansion was also reflected

by the recovery in consumer goods imports volume

and value indices during the year, in comparison

to the contraction in 2016. In the meantime, the

government consumption expenditure (GCE)

grew by 11.4 per cent in 2017, compared to 3.0

per cent growth in 2016. This was reflected in both

government individual consumption expenditure

and collective consumption expenditure, which

grew by 8.4 per cent and 12.9 per cent, respectively,

in 2017, compared to 2.7 per cent and 3.2 per cent,

respectively, in 2016. The expansion in GCE was

also reflected by the increase in the government

recurrent expenditure on interest payments, and

salaries and wages, which grew by 20.4 per cent

and 2.1 per cent, respectively, in 2017, compared to

19.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent growth, respectively,

in 2016.

PCE on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and

narcotics grew by 9.2 per cent in 2017 at current

market prices, compared to 9.3 per cent growth

in 2016. The slowdown in inflation of alcoholic

beverages and tobacco based on the NCPI to

10.8 per cent in 2017 from 22.1 per cent in 2016

may have contributed to increase the consumption

in this category. The PCE share of alcoholic

beverages, tobacco and narcotics remained at

2.0 per cent level in 2017.

The PCE on clothing and footwear

contracted by 20.6 per cent in 2017 at current

market prices against the 2.4 per cent growth

in 2016. This decline was also reflected in the

decrease in the clothing and accessories import

volume index by 4.5 per cent in 2017, compared to

13.7 per cent decrease observed in 2016.

Meanwhile, the inflation of clothing and footwear

based on the NCPI also slowed down to

3.2 per cent in 2017 from 3.7 per cent in 2016,

reflecting the subdued price pressure of this

category. Meanwhile, the share of clothing and

footwear in PCE declined to 4.0 per cent in 2017

from 5.4 per cent in 2016.

The PCE on housing, water, electricity, gas

and other fuels at current market prices, grew

by 5.7 per cent, yet at a slower rate in 2017,

compared to 13.7 per cent growth in 2016. The

electricity sales to domestic sector expanded by

4.4 per cent in 2017, compared to 8.3 per cent

expansion in 2016. Further, the units of water

distributed to the domestic sector increased by

3.1 per cent, albeit at a slower rate, in 2017,

compared to 12.8 per cent growth in 2016.

Meanwhile, the tariffs on electricity and water, and

prices of diesel and petrol remained unchanged

during the year, while the price of a domestic liquid

petroleum gas cylinder was revised upwards in

September 2017, contributing to the increase in

household expenditure in this category. Meanwhile,

the inflation of housing, water, electricity, gas and

other fuels based on the NCPI increased slightly

to 0.9 per cent in 2017, from 0.1 per cent in 2016,

reflecting the marginal price pressure remained in

this category.

The PCE on transport activities grew at a

higher rate of 25.6 per cent in 2017 at current

market prices, compared to 4.4 per cent growth

in 2016. The passenger transport fares on bus

services increased from July 2017, increasing the

household expenditure on transport. However, the

passenger transport fares on railways remained

unchanged during the year. The inflation of

transport activities based on the NCPI increased

to 5.9 per cent in 2017 from 5.1 per cent in

2016, which indicates that the growth of PCE, on

transport activities at current market prices, was

partly driven by the increase in price levels. The

share of transport activities in PCE increased to

21.6 per cent in 2017, compared to 18.7 per cent

in 2016.

The PCE on health activities grew by

8.2 per cent in 2017 at current market prices,

compared to 11.5 per cent growth in 2016,

whilst PCE on education activities contracted

by 1.8 per cent in 2017, same as the contraction

recorded in 2016. Meanwhile, the share of PCE in

these activities remained at relatively lower levels

of 3.0 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively, in

2017. The low levels of household consumption

expenditure on these categories were partly

attributable to the higher contribution from the

government in providing education and health

services for free of charge. This is also reflected

by the higher contribution of the government sector

to the value added of education and human health

activities, under the institutional classification of the

economy.

The PCE on communication grew by

4.4 per cent in 2017 compared to 9.8 per cent

growth in 2016. The telecommunication devices

import value and volume indices increased in

2017, compared to the previous year, reflecting

the expansion in the telecommunication industry.

This was further indicated by the continuous

expansion in telephone and internet connections

of the country, which grew by 7.0 per cent and

20.0 per cent, respectively, in 2017, compared to

the respective growth rates of 6.6 per cent and

20.3 per cent in 2016. In the meantime, the inflation

of communication services based on the NCPI

increased to 9.3 per cent in 2017, from 6.8 per cent

in 2016, reflecting the increase in the price levels of

these services.

The PCE on restaurants and hotels grew by

11.8 per cent in 2017, at current market prices,

compared to 7.9 per cent growth in 2016.

This growth indicates the rapid developments

in this industry with the increased demand for

these services and increasing number of hotels

and restaurants established in the country. The

inflation related to restaurants and hotels based on

the NCPI increased to 3.7 per cent in 2017 from

1.9 per cent in 2016.

The GCE, which consists of collective final

consumption expenditure and the individual

final consumption expenditure of the

government, expanded at a higher rate in

2017, compared to the slow growth in the

previous year, despite the efforts taken to

rationalise government expenditure. The

collective final consumption expenditure, which

consists of government expenditure on services

such as defence, social protection, general public

services, economic affairs and public order and

safety, accounted for 68.6 per cent of GCE in

2017. Accordingly, the collective final consumption

expenditure expanded at a higher rate of 12.9

per cent in 2017, compared to 3.2 per cent

growth in 2016. This acceleration in growth was

mainly attributable to the increased government

expenditure on general public services, which

substantially grew by 43.2 per cent in 2017 against

the 6.1 per cent contraction in 2016. Meanwhile,

the individual final consumption expenditure of

the government, which consists of government

expenditure on health and education services,

grew by 8.4 per cent in 2017, compared to 2.7 per

cent growth in 2016.

Investment

Investment expenditure continued to grow

by 16.6 per cent in 2017, yet at a slower pace,

compared to 22.0 per cent growth in 2016. The

investment on construction activities, which is the

largest category in the investment expenditure,

grew by 11.6 per cent in 2017, yet at a slower

rate, compared to 18.0 per cent growth observed

in 2016 at current market prices. This was also

reflected in the growth in importation of building

materials and the credit granted by the LCBs to

the private sector for construction activities in

2017, yet at a slower pace, compared to 2016.

Meanwhile, the development projects undertaken

by both the government and private sector, such

as infrastructure developments and large scale

residential and mixed development projects,

contributed to the expansion in construction

expenditure. Moreover, the growth in investment

expenditure was further augmented by the growth

of investment in machinery and equipment

and weapons systems, transport equipment,

information and communication technology (ICT)

equipment together with the growth of investment

in intellectual property. Further, the investment in

the areas of cultivated biological resources also

contributed to the overall growth in investment

activities. Moreover, the increase of 36.7 per

cent in the changes in inventories and acquisition

less disposals of valuables in 2017, compared to

64.8 per cent increase in 2016 also supported the

expansion in investment activities.

According to the Board of Investment

(BOI), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows

including loans to companies registered under

BOI, amounted to US dollars 1,710.3 million4

in 2017 as compared to US dollars 801 million

in 2016, reflecting a significant year-on-year

growth of 113.5 per cent. The main reason for

the notable increase in FDI inflows during the

period was the higher FDI inflows to infrastructure

projects amounting to US dollars 1,043.5 million,

recording a growth of 207.4 per cent, on account of

port container terminals that included the proceeds

to the Hambantota port, housing and property

development. FDI inflows for the manufacturing

sector reported a growth of 40.3 per cent

(US dollars 347.6 million) while FDI inflows to the

services sector grew by 50.0 per cent (US dollars

317.8 million) over the previous year. Meanwhile,

FDI inflows to infrastructure, manufacturing and

services accounted for 61.0 per cent, 20.3 per cent

and 18.6 per cent, respectively, of total FDI inflows

to the country during 2017.

Total estimated investments of projects

approved in 2017 under Sections 16 and 17 of

the BOI Act are estimated at Rs. 684.3 billion.

Estimated investment inflows into projects approved

in food, beverages and tobacco, textile, wearing

apparel and leather sectors increased compared

to the last year. However, investment value of

project approvals in the services, chemicals,

petroleum, coal, rubber and plastics, fabricated

metal, machinery and transport equipment, non-

metallic and mineral products sectors declined,

compared to 2016. The estimated investment

value of projects contracted under Section 17

was Rs. 488.8 billion, which was a decline of

35.5 per cent, compared with 2016. Estimated

investments of projects that commenced

commercial operations under Sections 17 and 16

of the BOI Act were Rs. 4,755.4 billion as at end

2017. The cumulative realised investment of the

BOI by end 2017 was Rs. 2,571.4 billion.

Availability and Utilisation of Resources

The available resources of the economy

continued to expand by 12.0 per cent in 2017,

compared to 8.8 per cent growth in 2016

amounting to Rs. 17,162.0 billion at current

market prices. In this regard, the domestic

resources and the external resources expanded at

a higher rate at current market prices during the

year compared to the previous year. The growth

in domestic resources was mainly driven by the

expansion in Industry and Services activities, as

Agriculture activities contracted during the year.

Further, the expansion of domestic resources at

current market prices was partly attributable to the

increased price levels, as reflected by the substantial

increase in the GDP deflator during the year.

Under external resources, imports grew at a higher

rate in 2017, at current market prices, compared

to the previous year and was partly attributable

to the increase in imports, particularly that of

food and beverages, and fuel, due to the severe

drought conditions that prevailed in the country,

which slowed down the domestic agricultural

production and the hydro power electricity

generation. Further, moderate depreciation of the

local currency also contributed to the increase in

the rupee value of imports at current market prices

during the year. Moreover, resource availability

increased at constant prices, recording a growth of

6.9 per cent in 2017 compared to 5.2 per cent

growth in 2016, mainly supported by the substantial

growth in external resources, at constant prices,

amidst the slowdown in domestic resources at

constant prices.

Available resources of the economy were

utilised for consumption, investment and

exporting purposes during the year. The share

of resources utilised for consumption purposes

in the total resources declined to 54.7 per cent

at current market prices in 2017, compared to

56.2 per cent in 2016. Meanwhile, the share

of resources utilised for investment purposes

increased to 28.3 per cent in 2017, compared

to 27.2 per cent in 2016. Accordingly, the share

of change in inventories and acquisition less

disposals of valuables in total resource utilisation

increased to 7.9 per cent in 2017, from 6.5 per cent

in 2016, while that of gross fixed capital formation

marginally declined to 20.4 per cent in 2017 from

20.7 per cent in 2016. Meanwhile, exports, as

a percentage of the total utilisation of resources,

increased to 17.0 per cent in 2017 from 16.6 per

cent in 2016. Meanwhile, the resource utilisation

at constant prices increased, mainly supported

by the increase in investment, which consists of

fixed capital formation and change in inventories

and acquisition less disposals of valuables, and

exports during the year.

Savings

Domestic savings of the economy

grew during 2017, albeit at a slower rate of

18.4 per cent, amounting to Rs. 3,896.0 billion,

compared to 27.1 per cent growth in 2016. In

this regard, the government dis-savings increased

as the improvement in government revenue

collection was insufficient to meet the upsurge in

government recurrent expenditure during the year

Meanwhile, private savings grew at a healthy rate,

contributing positively to the domestic savings.

Consequently, domestic savings as a percentage

of GDP increased to 29.3 per cent in 2017, when

compared to 27.6 per cent in 2016.

The national savings increased to Rs.

4,502.7 billion in 2017, registering a relatively

slower growth of 15.2 per cent, compared to

23.8 per cent growth in 2016. This slowdown

was mainly attributable to the combined effect of

lower growth observed in domestic savings and net

current transfers from the rest of the world together

with the continuous contraction in net primary

income from the rest of the world during the year.

However, national savings as a percentage of GDP

increased to 33.9 per cent in 2017 from 32.8 per

cent in 2016. Meanwhile, due to the relatively higher

growth in investment expenditure, the national

savings-investment gap widened to 2.6 per cent

of GDP in 2017 from 2.1 per cent of GDP in 2016.

2.6 Income

The income approach of national accounts

explains the disaggregated components,

namely Compensation of the Employees (CE),

Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) and taxes less

subsidies on production that generate income

within the economy. GOS which is the income

generated from factors of production other than

labour, grew by 11.9 per cent at current market

prices in 2017, compared to 7.2 per cent growth

in 2016, accounting for 69.1 per cent of total gross

value added, being the major income source. This

was mainly attributable to the expansion in Net

Operating Surplus (NOS) the main income category

in GOS that grew by 11.6 per cent in 2017, compared

to 6.9 per cent growth in 2016. Further, the other two

sub components of GOS which are consumption

of fixed capital and mixed income grew by

16.6 per cent and 9.3 per cent, respectively, in 2017,

compared to 10.5 per cent and 6.1 per cent growth,

respectively, in 2016. Meanwhile, CE which is the

income accruing to individuals in return for their

labour input into production process, accounted

for 30.6 per cent of the total gross value added of

the economy, recording a growth of 7.5 per cent in

2017, compared to 7.9 per cent in 2016. However,

taxes less subsidies on production contracted by

7.4 per cent in 2017, compared to 10.8 per cent

growth in 2016, accounting for 0.3 per cent of the

total gross value added of the economy.

According to the institutional sector

classification, the highest contribution to

the income was generated by the HH and

NPISH sector, accounting for 50.2 per cent

of total gross value added, recording a

9.5 per cent growth at current market prices in

2017. Further, the NFC sector, which is the second

largest contributor amounted to 34.9 per cent of

total gross value added, recording a growth of

10.8 per cent in 2017. With respect to the GOS, the

HH and NPISH sector represented 57.8 per cent

of GOS, recording a growth of 10.3 per cent at

current market prices in 2017. This was followed by

the NFC sector, which accounted for 35.3 per cent

and grew by 12.7 per cent at current market prices

in 2017. Meanwhile, the HH and NPISH sector,

which accounted for 33.5 per cent of CE grew by

6.5 per cent in 2017, at current market prices.

Further, the NFC and GG sectors also accounted

for 33.4 per cent and 26.9 per cent of CE,

respectively, in 2017 and recorded growth rates of

7.0 per cent and 3.7 per cent, respectively, at current

market prices during the year. NFC being the

major contributor to other taxes less subsidies on

production accounted to 91.0 per cent, contracted

by 7.4 per cent in 2017. Further, it is noteworthy to

highlight that, the HH and NIPSH sector accounted

only for 0.3 per cent of other taxes less subsidies

on production even though it accounted for

50.2 per cent of the total gross value added.
