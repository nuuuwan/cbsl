5.1 OverviewS

ri Lanka’s external sector improved

gradually during 2017, as the pressure

on the Balance of Payments (BOP)

eased with higher inflows to the financial

account in tandem with better domestic and

external conditions. Although the external

current account experienced a setback during

the year, enhanced investor confidence and

improved stability in domestic macroeconomic

conditions helped in attracting a substantially

higher amount of foreign currency inflows to the

financial account. The current account deficit

widened during the year due to the significant

improvement in export of merchandise goods

being outpaced by the increase in imports

together with higher interest payments, the

moderation in tourist earnings and the decline

in workers’ remittances. However, the influx of

foreign exchange to the financial account by way

of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), investment

in the government securities market and the

Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) as well as

other inflows to the government and the private

sector helped offset the current account deficit

while contributing to replenish the level of gross

official reserves and facilitate the maintenance

of a more market based exchange rate policy.

The current account deficit, which was

2.1 per cent of GDP in 2016, expanded to

2.6 per cent of GDP in 2017, triggered by the

widened trade and primary income deficits,

moderate earnings from tourism and lower

workers’ remittances. Although 2017 marked

the highest ever export earnings with a double-

digit growth, the trade deficit expanded to 11.0

per cent of GDP in 2017 from 10.9 per cent

of GDP in 2016 due to increased imports of

fuel, rice and gold, in particular. While exports

rose, supported by the synchronised growth

in advanced countries, reinstatement of the

European Union's Generalised System of

Preferences plus (EU-GSP+) facility and the

strong institutional and policy support, the surge

in imports was largely due to weather related

conditions with rice imports filling the void in

domestic production and fuel imports in place of

the loss in hydro power generation. The growth

in tourist earnings moderated while workers’

remittances recorded a decline in 2017, thus,

weighing negatively on the current account.

Tourism sector recorded a setback during the

year following the partial closure of the airport

for resurfacing of the runway as well as the

breakout of the dengue epidemic, moderating

the growth in overall export of services in 2017.

The decline in workers’ remittances in 2017,

was partly due to the sluggish economic activity

in the Middle Eastern region and the reduction

in labour migration under all skilled categories.

On the contrary, the financial account of the

BOP, which was under pressure during the first

quarter of 2017 due to higher foreign exchange

outflows, improved substantially thereafter.

In 2017, Sri Lanka witnessed a significant

increase in FDI, surpassing the annual quantum

hitherto recorded in the country. The notable

increase observed in foreign investment in the

government securities market and the CSE,

particularly during the last three quarters of the

year, positively impacted the financial account

of the BOP. Additionally, the financial account

was enhanced by the proceeds of the eleventh

International Sovereign Bond (ISB), the foreign

currency term financing facility, the receipt of

two tranches of the International Monetary Fund

Extended Fund Facility (IMF EFF) and other

foreign currency inflows to the government and

the private sector. These improvements in the

financial account were reflected in the overall

performance of the BOP, which recorded a

significant surplus of US dollars 2.1 billion in

2017, following two consecutive years of deficits.

During the year, the exchange rate policy of

the Central Bank was aimed at accommodating

greater flexibility in the determination of the

external value of the rupee based on the supply

of and demand for foreign exchange. The

Central Bank supplied a substantial amount of

foreign exchange liquidity to the domestic foreign

exchange market during the first quarter of the

year. This was in response to the depreciation

pressure on the rupee amidst the shortage of

foreign exchange liquidity in the market, arising

from outflows from the government securities

market. Consequently, the Central Bank changed

its intervention strategy since then to one of

absorption with purchases of foreign exchange

from the market to build up international

reserves. This move helped the Central Bank to

increase the quantum of non-borrowed reserves,

while enhancing the level of gross official

reserves of the country to US dollars 8.0 billion at

end-2017, which was equivalent to 4.6 months

of imports. Moreover, this strategy facilitated to

smooth out the behaviour of the exchange rate,

thus preventing sharp fluctuations. Reflecting

these developments, the external value of the

Sri Lankan rupee remained relatively stable,

depreciating only by 2.0 per cent against the US

dollar in 2017. The Real Effective Exchange Rate

(REER) indices also depreciated, getting closer to

the 100-index point mark by end-2017, indicating

an improvement in the external competitiveness

of the country.

Although the external sector gathered some

positive momentum during 2017, the build-up

of external buffers through an adjustment in the

current account with an improved trade balance

and higher foreign investment, is vital for

reducing the country’s vulnerability to external

shocks. Implementation of a comprehensive

export strategy remains a policy priority, as

improvement in the external current account

broadly depends on the narrowing down of

the trade deficit. Accordingly, diversifying

merchandise exports and improving productivity,

aiming to be cost effective while focusing on new

export destinations, will be important in boosting

export earnings. Policy focus should also be

directed towards harnessing the untapped

potential of the country as a services exporter,

to benefit from the skilled human resource

base. Reducing the dependence on foreign

borrowings to finance the current account deficit

and building up of the stock of international

reserves, through long term inflows such as FDI

is of utmost importance, especially in the context

of the bunching of debt service payments during

2019-2023. Some progress has been made, with

actions such as earmarking the proceeds from

commercialising non-strategic public assets

to address future debt service payments, the

enactment of the Active Liability Management

Act and the preparation of a Medium-Term Debt

Strategy for 2019-2023. High priority must be

attached to expediting the implementation of

these measures. This is essential for streamlining

external debt management. Implementing

a multi-pronged policy initiative is crucial in

addressing chronic issues in the external sector

in order for the economy to be more resilient to

shocks arising from the rest of the world.

5.2 External Trade Policies, Developments and Institutional Support

Efforts made by the government towards

greater integration with global markets,

redesigning of a more comprehensive trade

policy framework to promote and facilitate

external trade and measures taken towards

streamlining and enhancing institutional

support for trade facilitation were significant

in transforming the external trade policy

environment in 2017. The EU-GSP+, which

provides duty free access for about 7,200 tariff

lines to the EU, was reinstated in May 2017.

Introduction of a more comprehensive Trade Policy

and the finalisation of negotiations of the Free

Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore were also

among the favourable developments. In addition,

regional integration is expected to strengthen

further through trade and partnership agreements

with China and India, which are currently under

negotiation. In parallel with the negotiation of the

trade agreements, measures have been taken

to mitigate potential negative effects that can

emerge with liberalisation. The Anti-Dumping

and Countervailing Duties Act has been passed

by Parliament. In addition, Safeguard Measures

have been introduced to address import surges. A

Trade Adjustment Package is also being worked

out with the assistance of the World Bank, EU

and International Trade Centre (ITC) to support

local enterprises. Meanwhile, initiatives were

also taken towards the formulation of a more

comprehensive National Export Strategy (NES).

Following extensive stakeholder consultations, six

focus sectors and four trade supporting functions

have been identified in the NES, which is yet to

be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. Further,

designing of trade facilitation initiatives as per the

Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) of the World

Trade Organization (WTO), such as National Single

Window (NSW) and Trade Information Portal (TIP),

also commenced during 2017.

Sri Lanka benefitted from the GSP facility

during 2017. Accordingly, Sri Lanka benefitted

from GSP schemes offered by several developed

countries, including the EU, the USA, Australia,

Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation and

Turkey. During 2017, exports under the EU and US

GSP schemes have contributed substantially for

exports under preferential agreements. Following

the Sri Lankan Government’s submission in July

2016, the EU reinstated the EU-GSP+ on 19

May 2017. While the standard EU-GSP provides

preferential access for 66 per cent of total tariff lines,

the EU-GSP+ consists of the full removal of duties

for the same tariff lines, covering a wide array of

products, including textiles, garments and fisheries

exports from Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the GSP

offered by the USA expired on 31 December 2017.

However, on 23 March 2018, the USA government

re-authorised the GSP program until 31 December

2020, with a retroactive clause providing refunds

to importers of GSP eligible goods imported during

the lapsed period. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan exports

increased under the Global System of Trade

Preferences (GSTP) Agreement in 2017, mainly

led by cinnamon exports. Although, Sri Lanka

continues to enjoy several other GSP schemes

offered by trading partners in developed countries,

there has been a failure to export a large range of

products under such GSP schemes, in 2017, given

the narrow export base and product coverage. This

prevents the country from reaping the full benefit of

GSP schemes.

The government’s proactive engagement to

better positioning in global value chains (GVCs)

through new trade agreements, focusing on

potential markets, continued during 2017. Sri

Lanka and Singapore concluded eight rounds of

negotiations, starting in August 2016, culminating

into signing of the Sri Lanka - Singapore Free

Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) in January 2018.

The SLSFTA, which is a comprehensive

bilateral agreement covers separate chapters

on trade in services, investment, trade remedies,

telecommunications, e-commerce, government

procurement, competition, intellectual property

rights (IPR) and transparency. Since Singapore

currently offers duty-free market access for over

99 per cent of tariff lines of goods, Sri Lanka can

mainly benefit from this agreement by exporting

services and attracting investment from Singapore.

The chapter on e-commerce offers considerable

potential for Sri Lanka to access the ASEAN market

through Singapore. Following the Memorandum of

Understanding (MOU) signed between China and

Sri Lanka in September 2014, the two countries

have conducted six rounds of negotiations on the

proposed China - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement

(CSFTA). The CSFTA is expected to provide Sri

Lanka with a level playing field among competitors

in the ASEAN region, who are enjoying preferential

access to the Chinese market. In addition to

trade in goods, the CSFTA also covers trade in

services, investment, and economic and technical

cooperation. The ongoing negotiations of the

CSFTA are expected to be finalised and signed

in 2018. Meanwhile, continuous evaluations of

new preferential agreements were collaboratively

carried out by the Ministry of Development

Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT) and

the Department of Commerce (DOC). Several

review meetings were conducted to address issues

arising from preferential agreements, while Joint

Commissions were also conducted with countries,

such as Russia and Qatar, to improve bilateral trade

relations. Additionally, Sri Lanka is also considering

the possibility of signing FTAs with Bangladesh,

Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand.

As the trade creation of existing trade

agreements is at a significantly low level,

several measures were taken to further

rationalise the utilisation of existing bilateral

trade agreements. The India - Sri Lanka Free Trade

Agreement (ISLFTA), which has been in effect

since 2000, has contributed towards enhancing

bilateral trade between the two countries. The

utilisation of the ISLFTA favours Sri Lanka. About

64 per cent of Sri Lanka’s exports to India, led by

animal feed, arecanuts, paper waste and scrap,

spices, and insulated copper wires and cables,

compared to only about 6 per cent of imports from

India have taken place on preferential terms under

the ISLFTA. Ongoing negotiations on the proposed

Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement

(ETCA) between India and Sri Lanka continued

during the year, completing the seventh round in

December 2017. During these negotiations, issues

relating to non-tariff measures (NTMs) under

the ISLFTA, were also reviewed. In this regard,

the Sri Lankan authorities reiterated the need to

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

146

5

remove quantitative restrictions imposed under

the ISLFTA on some Sri Lankan exports, such as

apparel products, black pepper and desiccated

coconut. The ETCA is expected to be finalised

and signed in 2018. Meanwhile, the Pakistan - Sri

Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA), which has

been in effect since 2005, has also contributed

towards enhancing bilateral trade between the

two countries. The major products exported by

Sri Lanka under the PSFTA include betel leaves,

coconut products, MDF boards, rubber products and

cloves. However, lack of product diversification, ad

hoc policy changes and non-tariff barriers, such as

procedural delays, remain bottlenecks for exports

to Pakistan in spite of the increased utilisation of

the PSFTA in 2017.

Regional and multilateral preferential

trade agreements are becoming increasingly

important towards enhancing cooperation

among regional trade and services networks.

The Agreement on the South Asian Free Trade

Area (SAFTA), which was effected in 2006, aims

at further enhancing the integration of economies

in the SAARC region through the promotion of

preferential trade. This is an enhancement of the

South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement

(SAPTA) introduced in 1995. Hence, the SAPTA is

scheduled to be gradually replaced by the SAFTA,

resulting to decline the usage of tariff preference

under the SAPTA over time. The first phase of

the trade liberalisation programme (TLP) of the

SAFTA was completed by Sri Lanka in November

2015. Under the second phase of the TLP, Sri

Lanka is expected to reduce its initial sensitive

lists at least by 20 per cent by 31 December 2018.

However, earnings from exports under the SAFTA

continued to remain low and more than 80 per

cent of exports under the SAFTA was pepper. The

SAARC Agreement on Trade in Services (SATIS),

which was ratified, in November 2012, was in the

process of the finalising the national schedules

of commitments for member countries. Exports

under the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA)

increased in 2017 with black tea, coconut products

and selected garments consisting the major export

items. The first ever leaders’ summit of the Indian

Ocean Rim Association (IORA), which is an intra-

governmental organisation aimed at strengthening

regional cooperation within member countries,

was held in March 2017 in Indonesia. The 17th

and 18th rounds of Senior Officials Meetings and

the 15th round of Ministerial Meetings of the Bay

of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and

Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) were also held

in 2017. The necessity to intensify efforts to realise

the directives outlined and the agenda of action as

agreed by the leaders during the Goa Retreat was

reaffirmed during these meetings.

Sri Lanka’s engagement in relation to the

TFA, which is a significant achievement of the

WTO since its establishment in 1995, continued

during 2017. Sri Lanka ratified the TFA in May

2016. It came into effect in February 2017, with

two-thirds (110) of the WTO members having

completed their ratification. In May 2017, with the

support of the World Bank Group, a Secretariat

was established for the National Trade Facilitation

Committee (NTFC) with a view to facilitate domestic

coordination and implementation of the provisions

of the TFA and other trade facilitation initiatives in

Sri Lanka. The NTFC initiated activities to establish

the NSW and TIP. The TFA requires WTO members

to undertake trade facilitation commitments, that

are grouped into three categories. Category ‘A’

contains provisions to be implemented upon the

entry into force of the TFA, category ‘B’ contains

provisions to be implemented after a transitional

period, while category ‘C’ contains provisions to

be implemented after the building-up of capacities

obtained through TFA assistance and capacity

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

147

building programmes. As a result, Sri Lanka has

notified category ‘A’ commitments to the WTO

in July 2014, while notification of category ‘B’

and ‘C’ commitments, and their definitive dates

of implementation have been notified to the

WTO in February 2018. Furthermore, the 11th

WTO Ministerial Conference held in Argentina,

in December 2017, was concluded without an

agreement on a common Ministerial Declarations or

Decisions on sensitive matters such as agriculture,

fisheries subsidies and services.

Recognising the importance of strong

institutional support in promoting exports, the

government initiated several new measures

to strengthen the policy environment and

institutional capacity. The MODSIT formulated

the New Trade Policy (NTP) with four key elements,

namely competitiveness through domestic policy

reforms; market access and trade facilitation;

macroeconomic balance, policy and institutional

coherence; and the adjustment of firms and people.

The Cabinet of Ministers approved the NTP in

August 2017. In addition, the MODSIT, being the

main agency to promote and strategise Sri Lanka’s

competitiveness in international trade, initiated

several policy measures to improve institutional

coherence among entities, including the Board

of Investment (BOI) and the Export Development

Board (EDB). In line with these initiatives, the BOI

is in the process of implementing a virtual one-

stop-shop with a web enabled application tracking

system to expedite the investment approval process

through improvements in coordination among 24

identified key line agencies. Further, the MODSIT

has articulated a road map for investment climate

reforms towards improving the overall ranking of

Sri Lanka’s Doing Business to 70 by 2020 from

the current level of 110. Formulation of the NES by

the EDB to achieve a target of US dollars 27 billion

from merchandise and services exports by 2022

continued in 2017. Following extensive stakeholder

consultations, six focus sectors with potential to

further enhance export performance have been

identified, namely Information and Communication

Technology (ICT), Business Process Management

(BPM); wellness tourism; boat building; electrical

and electronic components; processed-food

and beverages; and spices and concentrates.

In addition, essential developments in trade

supporting functions such as trade information and

promotion; national quality infrastructure; logistics;

and innovation and entrepreneurship have also

been identified. The implementation of the NES is

expected to commence once the approval of the

Cabinet of Ministers is obtained.

Strong institutional support was extended

towards the implementation of strategies

on external trade during 2017. Prioritising the

NES in 2017, the EDB implemented a number of

programmes, while performing many activities

towards export promotion. In this regard, the EDB

is expected to establish an e-trade information

and promotion platform, which allows exporters

to access trade promotional tools and reliable

trade information on time. A national programme

to transform 2,000 regional SMEs as exporters

was initiated in March 2017, in Jaffna, while a

programme to encourage women entrepreneurs

was also commenced in Kilinochchi. It is expected

to set up farmer clusters on selected value

added products under the “One Village One

Product” programme. Further, routine activities

in relation to trade promotion and facilitation,

such as participation in recognised foreign trade

fairs, facilitation of inward and outward trade

delegations, conducting Exporters’ Forum to solve

trade related issues and appreciation of exporters

through award ceremonies continued during

2017. Trade Chambers also contributed towards

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

148

5

export promotion throughout the year. This was

instrumental in interconnecting the state and

private sector stakeholders. Trade Chambers were

involved in stakeholder consultations, awareness

campaigns and capacity building programmes

among exporters. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Customs

(SLC) streamlined their activities such as container

examination and release processes and refund

and drawbacks procedures. In addition, a bank

guarantee management system was introduced

to the ASYCUDA World System of the SLC while

several procedures were automated, such as yard

selection procedure and Less Container Load

(LCL) warehouse processes, in order to facilitate

the smooth flow of port activities.

Budget 2018 proposed several trade

supportive measures while trade and tariff

policies and legal amendments introduced

in 2017 focused on further rationalising and

simplifying the tax regime and promoting fair

trade. The Budget 2018 proposed measures to

strengthen the eco-certification programme, launch

an IT initiative to promote IT services exports,

support priority sectors under the NES to access

international markets, introduce an “export market

access support” programme allocating Rs. 800

million as a part of the trade adjustment programme

that was suggested by the NTP and provide

product development assistance to promote the

export sector. The government also envisages the

gradual phasing out of para-tariffs applicable in

the tax system with a view to promoting Sri Lanka

for foreign investment, particularly those related

to regional and global value chains (ie, accessing

international production sharing networks). In line

with this, duty rates of over 1,200 tariff lines have

been removed. To protect local industries against

unfair trading practices and unforeseen import

surges, Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties

Act No. 2 of 2018 and Safeguard Measures Act No.

3 of 2018 were enacted in March 2018. In addition,

SLC is in the process of amending the Customs

Ordinance to make necessary legal provisions for

TFA implementation.

Although external trade is gaining

momentum, global and domestic issues and

challenges continue to hinder the improved

performance. Historically highest export earnings

and FDI inflows as well as increased competitiveness

due to the flexible exchange rate reflect the

improved performance in external trade in 2017.

The synchronised growth in all leading economies

led to a notable increase in demand for exports

in 2017, while certain major obstacles, such as

the ban on the export of fisheries products to

the EU market and suspension of the EU GSP+

facility were successfully addressed during 2016

and 2017. Further, trade relations have been

strengthened through a new comprehensive FTA

with Singapore, while negotiations are ongoing

for entering into new FTAs with several trading

partners. Meanwhile, a comprehensive domestic

policy framework has been initiated as laid down

in the Government’s Vision 2025, NTP, NES and

the Investor Roadmap, with wider stakeholder

consultation. However, removing supply side

constraints, such as high production cost and

lack of required labour, which result in lower

competitiveness, need to be addressed as a

high priority. In addition, the possible impact of

the Brexit and the impact of protectionist policies

of advanced countries, especially the USA, and

the removal of the GSP schemes once Sri Lanka

reaches the upper middle-income status remain

as impending risks. To face these challenges,

remedial measures such as trade facilitation and

penetrating product sharing networks remain vital.

Moreover, creation of an export culture, along with

Research and Development (R&D) led innovation,

needs to be prioritised for sustainable expansion

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

in trade. Further, consistent domestic policies

in line with nonaligned foreign policies need to

be maintained along with the rationalisation of

the institutional framework, to create an investor

friendly environment. While continuation of efforts

to enhance market access through new FTAs

as well as increased economic cooperation is

important, capacity building in trade negotiations

and trade relations needs to be further improved

for successful negotiation and implementation of

FTAs.

adversely during the past two years, rebounded

strongly in 2017, recording the historically

highest value for earnings. The strong growth in

export earnings was underpinned by the restoration

of the EU-GSP+ facility, recovery in external

demand, expansion in investment in export related

industries, increased commodity prices in the

international market, conducive external trade

policies together with strong institutional support

and the flexible exchange rate policy maintained by

the Central Bank. Accordingly, with the continuous

double-digit growth registered in the second half

of the year, earnings from exports increased by

10.2 per cent to US dollars 11,360 million in 2017,

from US dollars 10,310 million in 2016. Earnings

from industrial exports mainly contributed to the

increase in export earnings in 2017, followed by

agricultural exports.

Earnings from industrial exports, which

accounted for about three fourths of total

exports, increased by 7.6 per cent to US dollars

8,542 million in 2017. Surpassing the US dollars

5 billion mark for the first time in history, export

earnings from textiles and garments, which account

for about 44 per cent of total exports, largely

contributed to the increase in industrial exports.

Despite the decline recorded during the first half of

2017, on a cumulative basis, earnings from textiles

and garments exports increased by 3.0 per cent to

reach US dollars 5,032 million in 2017, reflecting

the improved demand from the EU market following

the restoration of the GSP+ facility since May 2017.

Accordingly, the continuous increase in garment

exports to the EU market during the second half

of the year led to a 4.0 per cent growth (year-on-

year), reaching US dollars 1,982 million for the year

in 2017, while contributing to around 42 per cent

of total garment exports. Earnings from garment

exports to the USA increased by 1.7 per cent, while

those to non-traditional markets including Australia,

India, Canada, Hong Kong and Mexico increased by

3.9 per cent during the year. Further, earnings from

petroleum exports increased significantly by 51.4 per

cent to reach US dollars 434 million, in 2017, mainly

due to the combined effect of high average prices

and export volumes of bunker fuel. In line with high

fuel prices that prevailed in international markets,

average export prices of bunker fuel increased by

28.3 per cent during the year. Exported volumes

of bunker fuel also increased by 16.3 per cent due

to increased demand for Sri Lanka’s bunker fuel,

following the increase in taxes levied on bunker fuel

in India since July 2017. Export earnings from food,

beverages and tobacco rose by 21.3 per cent to US

dollars 393 million, in 2017, owing to the healthy

performance registered in vegetables, fruits and

nuts preparation, particularly coconut related

products such as liquid coconut milk and coconut

cream. Reflecting the improved performance in

almost all sub-categories, especially tyres, and

surgical and other gloves, export earnings from

rubber products increased by 8.8 per cent to US

dollars 835 million in 2017. Export earnings of

machinery and mechanical appliances, transport

equipment, base metals and articles, and wood

and paper products also contributed to the boost

in industrial exports. Meanwhile, earnings from

gems, diamonds and jewellery exports decreased

by 6.0 per cent during the year, reflecting the poor

performance reported in all sub-categories. Low

production of gem stones due to heavy rainfall

reported in gem mining areas and the impact of the

ban for issuance of back-hoe licenses contributed

to this decline. However, the decline in gem

exports was mainly due to low exports in raw form,

while the export of value added gems increased.

Export earnings from leather, travel goods and

footwear declined by 4.4 per cent to US dollars 158

million in 2017 due to low footwear exports. Also,

export earnings from ceramic products declined

due to decreases recorded in tiles and tableware,

household items and sanitaryware.

Maintaining its growth momentum

throughout the year, earnings from agricultural

exports rose significantly by 19.0 per cent to US

dollars 2,767 million in 2017. Favourable prices in

the international market, particularly for tea, mainly

contributed to this growth. Although export volumes

of tea remained broadly unchanged, earnings from

tea exports increased notably by 20.5 per cent to

US dollars 1,530 million, in 2017, owing to attractive

average export prices, in view of high prices in the

international market driven by the decline in global

supply, particularly from Kenya. Accordingly, the

average export price of tea increased by 20.5

per cent to US dollars 5.29 per kilogram in 2017,

from US dollars 4.39 per kilogram recorded in the

previous year. Although export volumes of tea

decelerated continuously until April 2017, impacted

by dry weather conditions during the early part

of the year, export volumes recovered during the

latter part of the year due to increased production

of low grown tea. Accordingly, export volumes of

tea increased by 0.1 per cent to reach 289 million

kilograms in 2017. Turkey, Russia, Iran, Iraq and

the United Arab Emirates (UAE) remained the main

tea export destinations, in 2017, contributing to

around 48 per cent of tea export earnings. Further,

export earnings from spices increased significantly

by 28.1 per cent to US dollars 406 million, in 2017,

reflecting the improved performance in cinnamon,

cloves and pepper exports. Earnings from

cinnamon exports increased by 27.4 per cent, in

2017, driven by high volumes and average export

prices. Despite the reduction in average export

prices, earnings from cloves and pepper exports

increased significantly during the year as a result

of high export volumes. Meanwhile, reflecting

the positive impact of the removal of the ban on

exports of fisheries products to the EU market

since June 2016 and the restoration of the GSP+

facility, earnings from seafood exports increased

considerably by 41.9 per cent to US dollars 241

million in 2017. Earnings from seafood exports

to the EU market rose significantly by 112.3 per

cent to US dollars 67 million during the year. In

addition, high demand for Sri Lankan seafood

from other countries, such as the USA, Vietnam,

Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan, also contributed

favourably to the healthy growth in seafood exports.

Further, earnings from minor agricultural products

increased significantly by 21.6 per cent to US

dollars 139 million in 2017, owing to higher earnings

from betel leaves (168.2 per cent), fruits (19.6 per

cent) and arecanuts (10.6 per cent). In addition,

export earnings from rubber, unmanufactured

tobacco and vegetables also contributed to the

increase in agricultural exports. Meanwhile, export

earnings from coconut declined by 4.9 per cent to

US dollars 348 million, in 2017, with the subdued

performance of coconut kernel products, despite

the increase in coconut non-kernel products. Even

though the average export prices of coconut kernel

products such as desiccated coconut, coconut oil

and copra increased substantially during the year,

lower coconut production due to adverse weather

conditions resulted in a contraction in export

volumes. However, export earnings from coconut

non-kernel products increased by 5.5 per cent

to US dollars 158 million, owing to the increases

registered in fibres and fresh coconut.

Earnings from mineral exports increased by

19.0 per cent to US dollars 34 million in 2017,

accounting for only 0.3 per cent of total export

earnings. Earnings from the export of earth and

stones followed by ores, slag and ash, and precious

metals contributed towards this growth.

5.3.2 Import Performance

Expenditure on imports rose considerably

in 2017, compared to the marginal increase

recorded in 2016 and the contraction in 2015,

reflecting the spill over effects of adverse

weather conditions and firming of international

commodity prices. Expenditure on imports

increased by 9.4 per cent to US dollars 20,980

million in 2017, recording the historically highest

value for imports, mainly due to higher fuel imports.

Meanwhile expenditure on non-fuel imports

increased by 5.1 per cent to US dollars 17,552

million.

Increase in import expenditure was mainly

driven by the increase in imports of intermediate

goods. Expenditure on imports of intermediate

goods, accounting for about 55 per cent of total

imports, amounted to US dollars 11,436 million,

in 2017, reflecting a year-on-year increase of 15.9

per cent. Expenditure on fuel imports increased

by 38.2 per cent to US dollars 3,428 million during

the year, with higher expenditure on imports of

all sub categories; crude oil, refined petroleum

products and coal. The highest contribution to

the increase in fuel imports came from refined

petroleum products, which grew by 45.9 per cent

owing to increases in import volumes, mainly

led by higher demand from the domestic power

generation sector in view of dry weather conditions

that prevailed in the country. High oil prices in the

international market also contributed to the surge

in expenditure on refined petroleum imports. Import

expenditure on coal increased by 32.9 per cent

while expenditure on crude oil imports increased

by 18.1 per cent due to higher prices, despite a

reduction in import volumes. Supply restrictions

by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting

Countries (OPEC) as well as robust demand on the

back of healthy global economic growth resulted in

firming international oil prices in 2017. Accordingly,

the average import price of crude oil imported

by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC)

increased by 24.8 per cent to US dollars 57.79

per barrel, in 2017, from US dollars 46.30 per

barrel in 2016. Meanwhile, import expenditure on

diamonds, precious stones and metals increased

significantly, owing to increased gold imports.

Expenditure on gold imports increased by 73.7

per cent to US dollars 650 million during the year,

following the removal of the Ports and Airports

Development Levy (PAL) on gold imports with

effect from January 2016. Despite this, there

was no significant increase in domestic jewellery

production or jewellery exports indicating an illicit

arbitrage of the tariff differential between India

and Sri Lanka. Import expenditure on base metals

also increased by 37.8 per cent to US dollars 629

million in 2017, reflecting the larger imports of iron

and steel. Despite the reduction in average import

prices of wheat, expenditure on wheat and maize

increased by 43.1 per cent to US dollars 357

million in 2017, owing to higher import volumes

of wheat. In addition, import expenditure on food

preparations also rose in 2017 mainly due to palm

oil imports, which increased by 75.6 per cent, due

to the high demand as a result of low domestic

coconut oil production and the reduction of the

duty imposed on palm oil imports. Meanwhile,

import expenditure on agricultural inputs, textiles

and textile articles, and plastic and articles thereof

increased during the year.

Import expenditure on fertiliser, chemical

products and mineral products recorded a

decline during the year, easing the pressure on

import expenditure to some extent. Expenditure

on fertiliser imports declined significantly by

24.9 per cent to US dollars 103 million, in 2017,

mainly due to the decline in imported volumes of

fertiliser, particularly urea and other nitrogenous

fertilisers. Meanwhile, import expenditure on

chemical products declined by 2.5 per cent due

to a reduction in almost all sub categories, while

expenditure on mineral product imports declined by

4.9 per cent with a contraction reported in cement

clinker imports.

Expenditure on consumer goods imports

increased by 4.3 per cent to US dollars 4,503

million in 2017, owing to high import volumes

of food and beverages. Import expenditure on

food and beverages increased by 13.1 per cent

to US dollars 1,841 million, mainly on account of

rice imports. Despite the reduction reported in

average import prices of rice, expenditure on rice

imports increased significantly to US dollars 301

million in 2017, from US dollars 13 million in 2016.

The sharp increase in rice imports reflected the

impact of the reduction of the Special Commodity

Levy (SCL) imposed on rice imports to meet

the shortage in the domestic market, which was

aggravated due to adverse weather conditions

that prevailed during two successive cultivation

cycles. Accordingly, imported volumes of rice

increased significantly to 748 million kilograms in

2017, from 30 million kilograms recorded in 2016.

Further, import expenditure on dairy products

also increased by 26.7 per cent to US dollars 316

million in 2017, mainly due to the high expenditure

incurred on milk powder. Despite a marginal

reduction in import volumes of milk powder, import

expenditure on milk powder increased notably by

27.6 per cent to US dollars 294 million as a result

of higher prices of milk powder prevailed in the

global market. In addition, import expenditure on

fruits, and oils and fats increased by 14.9 per cent

and 28.1 per cent, respectively, during the year.

However, expenditure on sugar imports declined

by 25.2 per cent to US dollars 256 million, due

to the combined effect of the decline in average

import prices and volumes of sugar. Moreover,

expenditure on spices, seafood and beverages

imports declined in 2017.

Import expenditure on non-food consumer

goods declined by 1.1 per cent to US dollars

2,661 million in 2017, owing to a reduction in most

imports under this category. Import expenditure on

personal motor vehicles declined by 2.8 per cent to

US dollars 773 million during the year mainly due to

the 16.2 per cent reduction reported in the importation

of motor cars, despite an increase in motor cycles.

Import expenditure on rubber products also declined

by 15.8 per cent to US dollars 94 million, in 2017, owing

to lower imports of all sub categories, particularly tyres

and tubes. In addition, contractions were recorded in

the expenditure on home appliances (4.6 per cent),

cosmetics and toiletries (10.8 per cent), and medical

and pharmaceuticals (1.1 per cent) during the year.

In contrast, import expenditure on telecommunication

devices, household and furniture items, and clothing

and accessories increased in 2017.

Import expenditure on investment goods

declined in 2017, reflecting the reduced imports

of machinery and equipment. Expenditure on

investment goods imports, which account for

around 23 per cent of total import expenditure,

decreased by 1.7 per cent to US dollars 4,895

million, in 2017. Import expenditure on machinery

and equipment contracted by 4.4 per cent to US

dollars 2,621 million, reflecting the significant

reduction in agricultural and textile industry related

machinery, electric motors and generating sets,

machinery and equipment parts, and turbines.

However, import expenditure on building materials

increased by 1.4 per cent to US dollars 1,591 million

in 2017, mainly due to higher imports of iron and

steel. Meanwhile, import expenditure on transport

equipment increased by 1.8 per cent to US dollars

675 million.

5.3.3 Trade Balance

The deficit in the trade balance widened in

2017 due to the higher increase of expenditure

on imports, which outpaced the increase in

export earnings. The trade deficit expanded

significantly during the early part of the year owing

to high import expenditure incurred due to adverse

weather conditions. However, the expansion in

the trade deficit decelerated during the second

half of the year, with higher earnings from exports

reflecting the positive impact of the restoration of

the GSP+ facility. Consequently, the trade deficit

widened to US dollars 9,619 million in 2017 from

US dollars 8,873 million in 2016. The trade deficit

as a percentage of GDP increased to 11.0 per cent

in 2017 from 10.9 per cent in 2016.

5.3.4 Terms of Trade

Sri Lanka’s terms of trade improved in 2017

as the export price index increased at a higher

rate than the import price index. Commodity prices

in the international market rose in 2017, leading to

an increase in the export price index by 2.4 per cent

to 96.4 index points, while the import price index

increased at a lower rate of 1.2 per cent to 91.3 index

points. With these developments, the terms of trade

improved by 1.2 per cent to 105.5 index points in

2017, from 104.3 index points in 2016.

The overall export price index rose largely

due to the increase in prices of agricultural

exports by 11.9 per cent. Export prices of tea

increased by 18.9 per cent in 2017, while the

IntroductionIn Sri Lanka, international trade statistics are reported based on the Harmonised System Code (HS Code), which is an international standardised system of names and numbers to classify traded products. The HS Code captures the statistics related to the categories of key export and import items of a country. This system enables international comparability of trade statistics up to six-digit level and the HS Convention allows countries to introduce statistical details beyond the six-digit level in order to preserve necessary flexibility in accommodating national needs.1 The Central Bank also compiles and publishes international trade statistics based on HS Codes and guided by the HS Convention, the Central Bank reclassified the country’s trade basket in 2011, based on the National Import Tariff Guide - 2010 of the Sri Lanka Customs (SLC).

The Central Bank obtains import and export data from the SLC to compile trade statistics on a monthly basis. In the process of compiling trade statistics, the Central Bank makes necessary adjustments to the data relevant to certain key import and export items. These adjustments help to compile data more accurately, which is useful to gauge the country’s trade performance in a timely manner. However, certain limitations entail the current method of classification of trade statistics, particularly in terms of international comparison, although these statistics provide some insights regarding trends and performance of Sri Lanka’s external trade. As Sri Lanka is actively engaged in several policy initiatives, such as exploring of potential markets, expanding the export base and positioning of the country in key global value chains, the availability of high quality data, which are compiled based on international best practices and standards, remains a vital requirement.

Standard International Trade Classification (SITC)The classification of merchandise trade statistics based on the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) is widely used for international comparison of trade statistics across countries. Recognising the importance of adhering to international standards, the Central Bank commenced compilation of trade statistics based on SITC, which is an internationally accepted and standardised method of trade statistics classification recommended by the United Nations. SITC helps comparability of international trade statistics and provides a reliable picture of the latest developments in international trade at a fairly accurate commodity-specific level. SITC can be used to study long-term trends in international merchandise trade, since revisions to SITC classification are made less frequently. Hence,

1 Trade statistics are harmonised only up to six-digit level, while country specific classifications are allowed beyond that level.

BOX 4Compilation of International Trade Statistics under Standard International Trade Classification

SITC is known to facilitate more scientific and robust analysis and these statistics are useful for policy makers as well as for researchers.

Structure of SITC

The first SITC method was introduced in 1950 and the increase in the volume of trade and the changes that had taken place in geographical and commodity patterns as well as technological changes led to several revisions to the SITC. Currently, the 4th revision, which was published in 2006 (SITC - Revision 4), is used by countries to ensure international comparability and analytical value of trade statistics.

In order to facilitate comprehensive economic analyses, as per SITC, traded products are classified not only on the basis of their material and physical properties, but also according to the stages of processing and economic functions. Based on the guidelines of the United Nations, SITC-Revision 4 comprises 10 sections, which is termed as one-digit code, 67 divisions (two-digit code), 262 groups (three-digit code), 1,023 subgroups (four-digit code) and 2,970 basic headings (five-digit code). Hence, the SITC follows a hierarchical structure in presenting the items in a trade basket.

The classification scheme of the SITC Revision 4 to classify all the traded items and its hierarchical structure are given in Table B.4.1.

Comparison of Trade Data

According to the classification currently followed by the Central Bank, trade statistics are categorised under four levels, where each item is identified under a major category, minor category, an item and a sub item. Based on the level of value addition, about 8,000 export items are categorised under major categories, namely agricultural exports, industrial exports, mineral exports and unclassified exports. Export items in the primary form or with relatively low levels of value addition have been classified under agricultural or mineral exports, whereas those items with significant levels of value addition have been classified under industrial exports. With respect to imports, around 13,000 import items have been categorised under the major import categories of consumer goods, intermediate goods, investment goods and unclassified imports and the main basis for the classification is the prevailing tariff structure. The highest tariff rates are generally applied on consumer goods to discourage excessive imports of consumer goods, while zero or low rates are applied on investment goods and consumer goods that are deemed to be essential items. The middle tariff rates are applied mainly on intermediate goods. In addition, importation of final goods is classified either as a consumer good or investment good (eg: buses are included in investment goods and motor cars are classified as consumer goods), while imported goods used for interim purposes are classified as intermediate goods, for example, textiles and petroleum. Further, semi processed imported items are classified according to the level of value addition and thereby imported items that have relatively low value addition are categorised under consumer goods, while high level of value addition items are classified as intermediate goods. The Central Bank deploys this classification in publishing the trade statistics for the benefit of stakeholders and conducting relevant analyses for the purpose of policy formulation.

However, as per the method based on SITC, items are mainly classified into ten sections based on their material and physical properties, processing stages, market practices and uses of the products, importance of the commodities in terms of world trade, and technological changes. Accordingly, the current trade statistics, which are compiled based on the HS Code, can be reclassified based on the SITC, enabling international comparability of the Sri Lankan merchandise trade statistics.

A graphical representation of the relationship between the existing classification and SITC is given in Figure B.4.1.

Even though, the methodologies of two classifications are different, total export and import numbers can be tallied at the final compilation stage. Therefore, no valuable information is lost due to such reclassifications. The statistics under SITC is now published in the Annual Report 2017 (Statistical Appendix Tables 68, 69, 81 and 82). As the SITC has been recognised as an analytical tool, while the use of HS Code remains vital to compile and disseminate trade statistics for domestic policy purposes, the Central Bank intends to continue the compilation of trade statistics based on both approaches and publish such statistics in its key publications and databases.

export price indices for both coconut and minor

agricultural products increased by 7.1 per cent.

However, the export price index for spices recorded

a decline. Meanwhile, the export price index

relating to industrial exports declined marginally by

0.3 per cent in 2017, mainly led by the reductions

in export price indices of transport equipment,

gems, diamonds and jewellery, machinery and

mechanical appliances, and plastics and articles

thereof. However, the price index for petroleum

products increased significantly by 23.1 per cent

together with price indices for exports of rubber

products (3.6 per cent), ceramic products (1.8 per

cent) and food, beverages and tobacco (1.8 per

cent). Although, the price index in respect of textiles

and garments declined by 1.6 per cent during the

first half of 2017, this index reflected a marginal

increase of 0.9 per cent by the end of the year.

During 2017, the increase in the import

price index was led by intermediate goods,

while the import price indices of consumer

goods and investment goods remained lower

in comparison to the previous year. The import

price index for intermediate goods increased by 4.1

per cent in 2017 driven by the 18.7 per cent growth

in the import price index for fuel. Further, import

price indices for several sub-categories within the

intermediate goods category, including vehicle and

machinery parts, unmanufactured tobacco and

base metals, increased in 2017. In contrast, the

import price index for consumer goods declined by

2.5 per cent, reflecting price reduction in food and

beverages, despite a marginal increase in non-food

consumer goods. Within the food and beverages

category, the import price index for rice, spices,

vegetables, beverages and sugar declined, while

that of dairy products recorded a noticeable growth

during this period. Reflecting price reductions in

building materials and machinery and equipment,

the import price index for investment goods

declined by 1.6 per cent in 2017.

5.3.5 Direction of Trade

India remained Sri Lanka’s major trading

partner in 2017, followed by China and the USA,

all of which together contributed to around 40 per

cent of total trade with Sri Lanka. Value of trade

between Sri Lanka and India surpassed the US dollars

5 billion mark in 2017, registering a share of 16.1 per

cent of Sri Lanka’s total external trade. Trade with

China and the USA exceeded US dollars 4 billion and

US dollars 3 billion, respectively. In addition, trade

with countries such as the UAE, Singapore, the UK

and Japan exceeded US dollars 1 billion in 2017.

Trade with India, Singapore, the UAE, Japan and the

USA increased in 2017 in comparison to the previous

year while trade with China and the UK declined.

Continuing the trade patterns observed in previous

years, Western countries, especially the USA and

the UK continued to be the main destinations for Sri

Lankan exports, while Asia, particularly India and

China, dominated Sri Lanka’s imports.

The USA continued to be the single largest

buyer of Sri Lankan exports, accounting for 25.6

per cent of total exports, followed by the UK (9.1

per cent) and India (6.1 per cent). In 2017, total

exports to the USA increased by 3.5 per cent to US

dollars 2,909 million, while exports of garments,

rubber products and seafood accounted for

about 85 per cent of total exports to the USA.

As the largest garment export destination of

Sri Lanka, the USA accounted for 45.2 per cent

of total garment exports, reaching US dollars

2,140 million in 2017. Exports to the UK, the

second largest export destination, recorded a

marginal decline in 2017 due to a contraction in

the export of garments, coconut products and

rubber products. However, seafood, leather,

travel goods and footwear, and tea exports to

the UK increased in 2017. India, the third largest

destination for Sri Lankan exports, recorded

a 24.8 per cent growth in 2017 with a notable

increase observed in petroleum products and

spices. In addition, base metals and articles,

food, beverages and tobacco, animal fodder and

garments contributed towards enhancing exports

to India in 2017. Further, exports to Germany

and Italy, the fourth and fifth largest export

destinations for Sri Lanka, increased by 8.1 per

cent and 21.9 per cent, respectively, in 2017,

mainly due to the increase in garment exports.

With the restoration of the GSP+ facility, earnings

from garment exports to the EU increased by 4.0

per cent in 2017, in view of the high demand

from Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and

Denmark, leading to an increase in total export

earnings from the EU. Garments continued to

be the main export item to the EU, accounting

for 60.0 per cent of total exports to the region.

In addition, seafood exports, which accounted

for 2.0 per cent of total exports to the EU also

increased significantly, in 2017, supported by

the removal of the ban on the export of fisheries

products to the EU along with the restoration of

the GSP+ facility. With the gradual recovery in the

Middle East and Russia, earnings of Sri Lankan

tea from these countries increased significantly,

in 2017. Accordingly, tea exports to Turkey, Iraq

and Russia increased during 2017, contributing

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

to 32.3 per cent of earnings from tea exports.

In 2017, 44.5 per cent of total tea exports went

to the Middle East region and 11.4 per cent to

Russia.

India regained its position as the main

source of imports for Sri Lanka in 2017, with

a notable share of 21.6 per cent of total import

expenditure. During 2017, expenditure on imports

from India increased to US dollars 4,527 million,

registering a 18.7 per cent growth along with

petroleum products, rice, base metals and building

materials imports. While, China, the second largest

source of imports accounted for 18.9 per cent of

total imports, the associated import expenditure

recorded a marginal decline of 1.0 per cent to US

dollars 3,955 million in 2017. Lower imports of

transport equipment, petroleum products, fertiliser,

base metal, chemical products, and machinery and

equipment contributed to this decline. However,

textiles and textile articles, telecommunication

devices, and vehicle and machinery parts imported

from China increased during the year. The UAE,

the third largest, import source accounted for 8.1

per cent of total imports with petroleum products

and diamonds, precious stones and metals

remaining key imports. Singapore was the fourth

largest source with imports of petroleum products,

diamonds, precious stones and metals, as well as

telecommunication devices. Imports from Japan

increased by 9.3 per cent in 2017, making Japan the

fifth largest import sourcing country for Sri Lanka,

due to higher imports of transport equipment, base

metals, rubber and articles thereof, and building

materials. However, vehicles, which constitute the

major import item from Japan, declined significantly

during 2017 responding to the macroprudential

measures introduced in 2016.

5.4 Current and Capital Account

5.4.1 Trade in Services

Trade in services continued to support

the external current account by recording

considerable growth in 2017. A moderate

growth in earnings from tourism during the

year and a healthy growth in transportation

and computer services contributed towards the

increase in earnings from export of services by 8.7

per cent to US dollars 7,760 million in 2017, from

US dollars 7,138 million in 2016. Stemming from

the rising demand for services imports, outflows

on account of services also increased by 3.8 per

cent to US dollars 4,421 million during the year.

Accordingly, the services account of the BOP,

recorded a surplus of US dollars 3,338 million

in 2017 in comparison to a surplus of US dollars

2,879 million in 2016.

Transport Services

The continuous improvement in transport

services supported the expansion in the

services account in 2017. Increased earnings

on account of passenger fares, freight charges,

and port and airport related activities helped

gross inflows from the transport sector to reach

US dollars 2,376 million in 2017, registering a

growth rate of 5.6 per cent over the previous year.

Reflecting higher port and airport related service

payments, due to increased spending on freight

and air travel services, outflows on account of

transport services also grew by 4.3 per cent to US

dollars 1,688 million during the year. Accordingly,

net inflows from the transport sector increased to

US dollars 688 million during the year, from US

dollars 632 million in 2016.

Inflows relating to passenger fares

contributed favourably to improve the services

account in 2017. Accordingly, earnings from

passenger fares increased by 8.0 per cent to US

dollars 1,158 million during the year. Earnings from

passenger fares moderated during the first quarter

of the year as a result of the drop in the number of

passengers travelling to Sri Lanka caused by the

partial closure of the Bandaranaike International

Airport (BIA) during January to April 2017 due

to the resurfacing of the runway. However, a

gradual revival of earnings from passenger

fares was witnessed towards the latter part of

the year. The satisfactory performance related

to passenger fares can be mainly attributable

to the upward revision of airfares during the

year and the increased number of passengers

travelling to Sri Lanka. This improvement was also

supplemented by the expansion in the number

of destinations served by SriLankan Airlines

reaching the highest number of destinations in Sri

Lanka’s aviation history. These new destinations

included Melbourne, Australia and several cities

in India. Moreover, SriLankan Airlines acquired

five new fuel-efficient aircrafts in 2017, with a view

to enhancing its operational efficiency. These

efficiency improvement measures together with

the widened regional presence and increased

flight frequencies are expected to augment the

revenue generation capacity of air transport sub

sector over the medium term.

Inflows on account of freight charges,

increased in 2017 as a result of increased

cargo, container and transshipment volumes

handled at the port of Colombo. Accordingly,

gross inflows from freight charges, with respect to

both port and airport related activities, increased

by 3.4 per cent to US dollars 1,217 million in

2017. During the year, the port of Colombo

marked the achievement of handling over 6 million

TEUs for the first time in the history of the port,

contributing towards the expansion of the maritime

services sector. Expansion in the container and

cargo handling capacity of the Colombo port

continued to support the growth momentum

in the maritime sector. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka

became the best-connected country in terms of

maritime transportation in the South Asian region

surpassing India, after being ranked 15th in the

global “Liner Shipping Connectivity Index 2017”

published by the United Nations Conference on

Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

Travel and Tourism

The tourism industry, remained the third

largest foreign exchange earner to the country,

despite recording a moderate growth of tourist

arrivals in 2017. Although tourist arrivals recorded

highest annual arrivals of 2,116,407 in 2017, the

year-on-year growth in arrivals moderated to 3.2

per cent. Flight cancellations and delays at the

BIA, caused by partial operation of the Airport till

April 2017 owing to repairs and the upgrade of the

epidemic in mid-2017, partly contributed to the

sluggish performance in the tourism industry.

However, the arrivals showed some recovery,

recording the highest ever monthly arrivals during

December 2017.

Tourist arrivals from all major regions,

except the Middle East, increased in 2017.

Western Europe continued to be the largest tourist

origin for Sri Lanka, representing 32.2 per cent of

total tourist arrivals, which grew at 5.8 per cent

to 680,901 arrivals. Tourist arrivals from South

Asia, the second largest tourist origin of Sri Lanka,

recorded a marginal growth of 0.9 per cent, in

2017, although the share of arrivals declined to

24.5 per cent from 25.0 per cent in 2016. The share

of tourist arrivals from East Asia that has continued

to increase since 2010 accounted for 21.0 per cent

of total arrivals in 2017, while recording moderate

growth of 4.5 per cent, led by arrivals from

Indonesia and the Philippines. India maintained

its lead as the prime tourist source, contributing

mostly to the growth with 384,628 arrivals in 2017,

while China remained the second largest origin

albeit recording a marginal decline, followed by

the UK, Germany and France. These five largest

tourist source destinations together accounted

for 51.2 per cent of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka

in 2017. Meanwhile, arrivals from the Maldives,

the seventh largest tourist origin of Sri Lanka,

declined in 2017. In terms of the purpose of visit to

Sri Lanka, a majority of tourists (83.9 per cent)

visited the country for leisure. While, tourist arrivals

for business purposes accounted for 2.9 per cent,

the share of tourist arrivals for other purposes,

such as visiting friends and relatives, religious and

cultural purposes, health, education and sports,

was 13.2 per cent of total arrivals in 2017.

Despite a lower than expected growth in

tourist arrivals, earnings from tourism remained

healthy with increased average spending

and duration of stay by tourists during 2017.

Earnings from tourism increased by 11.6 per cent

to US dollars 3,925 million in 2017, in comparison

to US dollars 3,518 million in 2016. In 2017, the

average spending per tourist rose to US dollars

170.1 per day, from US dollars 168.2 per day in

2016, according to the latest annual survey on tourist

spending and duration of stay, conducted by the

Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA).

Further, the average duration of stay by a tourist was

estimated at 10.9 days in 2017, in comparison to

10.2 days in 2016. Tourist earnings are expected to

grow steadily over the medium-term complemented

by targeted promotion campaigns and continued

investment in upgrading and expanding tourism

related infrastructure. Meanwhile, outflows related

to travel are also estimated to have increased by

3.7 per cent to US dollars 1,599 million in 2017.

Given these developments, the travel and tourism

sub sector recorded a surplus of US dollars 2,326

million in 2017.

Investment in the tourism sector continued

to expand further in 2017. Since the initiation of

the One Stop Unit (OSU) at the SLTDA in 2010,

which was a centralised promotion and facilitation

centre established to assist potential investors who

are interested in investing in the tourism industry,

about 639 project proposals have been received

by this institution. Out of these, 539 hotel projects

with capacity of 29,946 rooms were approved by

end-2017, entailing a total investment of US dollars

5,191 million. During the year, investment proposals

for 95 new hotel projects were received, entailing

an investment value of US dollars 314 million. The

final approvals were granted for 45 hotel projects

with 2,393 rooms, with a total value of US dollars

380 million, in 2017, in comparison to 41 projects

amounting to US dollars 126 million approved

in 2016. Several international hotels, including

Shangri-La Colombo and Movenpick commenced

their operations, while several major hotel projects,

such as Hyatt, Sheraton, ITC and NEXT continued

construction work during the year. Further,

supplementary establishments, including boutique

villas, guest houses, home stays, heritage homes,

bungalows and rented apartments, increased by

135 to 1,693, in 2017, resulting in an increase in

total room capacity by 974 rooms to 12,509.

Investment into tourism development

projects at the provincial level also continued

during 2017. Integrated tourism development

projects such as Dedduwa, which is considered

Sri Lanka’s largest tourism project so far, has

completed its land acquisition process. In addition,

locations have been identified for other integrated

development projects in Iranawila, Akurala, Zone

02 of Kalpitiya and Kuchchaweli. Further, SLTDA

is in the process of developing separate Tourism

Development Master Plans for Ella, Arugambay,

Kalpitiya, Nuwara Eliya, Beruwala, Hikkaduwa and

Pinnawala areas, considering their uniqueness to

attract tourists.

Several policy initiatives and actions were

implemented in 2017 to harness the potential of

Sri Lanka’s tourism industry. The New Tourism

Strategic Plan (TSP) 2017-2020 was introduced to

facilitate Tourism Vision 2025 and help achieve the

United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals

on tourism. Accordingly, it is expected to raise

earnings from tourism up to US dollars 7 billion,

employ 600,000 workers in support industries,

and to increase daily spending per tourist to US

dollars 210 by 2020. Further, the NES, which is to

be implemented in 2018, has identified wellness

tourism among its six focus sectors. Some of the

recommendations of these policy initiatives have

already been considered and required funds have

been allocated through the Budget 2018. Activities

related to the absorption of informal sector tourist

establishments to the formal sector, tourism mobile

services to expedite the inspection, registration

and licensing process and registration of tourist

friendly eating places were continued during 2017.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion

Bureau (SLTPB) continued its country specific

promotional activities in 32 identified markets in

2017, including participation in trade fairs, road

shows and promotions. The SLTPB, the Singapore

Cooperation Enterprise and Temasek Foundation

International, joined a partnership in March 2017 to

share experiences of Singapore in marketing and

promote tourism through digital modes. Meanwhile,

12 cruise ships with around 37,000 passengers

were welcomed and serviced at the Colombo

port. As a result of tourism promotion campaigns,

Sri Lanka received further endorsements and

accolades from world renowned tourism related

magazines and organisations, such as Bloomberg,

National Geographic and Vogue. In particular,

Sri Lanka was selected as the “Asia’s Leading

Destination” at World Travel Awards Asia in 2017.

Further, the SLTPB expects to appoint “Destination

Representation Companies” in several countries

including the UK, Germany, France and Australia,

in 2018, to ensure the continuous presence of

Sri Lanka in these countries.

Although the tourism sector remains a

promising foreign exchange earner of the

economy, Sri Lanka has not yet tapped its full

potential in the global market. Sri Lanka attracted

over 2 million tourists in 2016 and 2017, but countries

smaller than Sri Lanka in the South East Asian

region, such as Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong,

attract over 10 million tourists per year. Therefore,

to reap the benefit of the untapped potential of the

Sri Lankan tourism industry, it is vital to expedite the

implementation of a strategic approach addressed

through the TSP 2017-2020. A coordinated effort

is needed between the government and tourism

industry stakeholders, through Public Private

Partnership (PPP) ventures to achieve sustainable

tourism targets of the TSP by 2020. In addition,

Sri Lanka needs to explore potential areas of water

related tourism activities such as cruise tourism,

whale and dolphin watching, diving and snorkelling,

kite surfing as well as pilgrimage tourism, culinary

tourism, bird watching, wedding tourism, film tourism

and MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and

Events) tourism in order to thrive as the country’s key

foreign exchange earner.

Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services

Being one of the key growth drivers

within services exports, earnings from

telecommunication, computer and information

services demonstrated a steady growth

in 2017. Total earnings from the export of

telecommunications, computer and information

services amounted to US dollars 926 million in 2017,

registering a growth of 7.8 per cent over 2016. The

telecommunications sub-sector grew moderately

during the year with total earnings increasing to US

dollars 140 million from US dollars 134 million in

2016. This growth mainly originated from increased

usage of internet based communication facilities

supported by broadband data services. Meanwhile,

a drastic decline in the usage of International Direct

Dialling (IDD) services restricted the expansion of

earnings to a certain extent. In 2017, Sri Lanka’s

telecommunications industry initiated the process

of adopting fifth generation (5G) technology which

will enable futuristic technology applications such

as the “Internet of Things” based autonomous

transport, industry automation using robotics and

digital business solutions. Moreover, as a step

towards becoming the digital hub of the region,

South Asia’s first state-of-the-art submarine

cable depot is planned to be established in the

port of Galle. These developments are expected

to boost the revenue generation capacity of the

telecommunications industry over the medium-

term through enhanced global connectivity.

The computer and information services

sub-sector also maintained its growth

momentum in 2017. Accordingly, gross inflows to

the computer and information services improved

by 8.5 per cent to US dollars 786 million during

the year. Rapid expansion of Software and

Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES)

that includes Business Process Outsourcing

(BPO) and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO)

continued to contribute towards the healthy growth

in this sector. In 2017, Sri Lanka was ranked

eleventh, moving up three notches from 2016, in

A. T. Kearney’s “Global Services Location Index”, a

study that analyses and tracks the contours of the

offshoring landscape in 55 countries across three

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

major categories: financial attractiveness, people

skills and availability, and business environment.

This study has highlighted comparatively low labour

costs and longer tax holidays as factors that make

Sri Lanka an attractive outsourcing destination

over its regional peers. Moreover, with a view to

unleashing the full potential of the ITES industry,

the government in its National Budget 2018, has

proposed to establish an angel fund called “IT

Initiative” to provide financial assistance to startups,

and small and medium sized companies in the IT

industry.

5.4.2 Primary Income

In line with the trend observed in recent

years, the deficit in the primary income account

widened, with increased reinvested earnings

by direct investment enterprises (DIEs) and

increased interest payments on ISBs and

project loans of the government. Accordingly,

the deficit in the primary income account widened

to US dollars 2,355 million in 2017 from US

dollars 2,202 million in 2016. Despite the increase

in outflow in the primary income account, the

increase in reinvested earnings by DIEs can be

considered positively as the same amount is

reflected in the financial account as an increase in

direct investment. Although the profitability of DIEs

in 2017 remained similar to the level recorded

in the previous year, DIEs opted for lesser

declaration of dividends and a higher reinvestment

of earnings during the year. A notable increase in

interest payments on portfolio investment was also

observed in 2017 as coupon payments on ISBs

issued by the government increased in 2017, with

coupon payments of the new issuances of ISBs in

July 2016 and May 2017 being made in addition to

the coupon payments in 2016. Meanwhile, coupon

payments on international bonds issued by the

banking sector reduced with the maturity of a US

dollars 500 million international bond issued by the

Bank of Ceylon (BOC) in 2017. Interest payments

on foreign loans obtained by the government

also increased as a result of the new foreign

currency term financing facilities and project loans

obtained by the government. Interest payments by

commercial banks decreased during the year with

a reduction in their long term liabilities compared

to the previous year. However, the widening of the

primary income deficit was moderated to a certain

extent by increased inflows to the primary income

account. Return on investment of reserve assets

increased in 2017 reflecting the increase in gross

official reserve levels during the year compared

to 2016. This was further supported by increased

income on foreign assets held by the banking

sector, possibly reflecting the effect of increased

global interest rates during 2017.

5.4.3 Secondary Income

The secondary income account, which

consists of private and government transfers,

remained subdued during 2017 with modest

performance in workers’ remittances. Workers’

remittances, which account for the majority of

inflows to the secondary income account declined

by 1.1 per cent to US dollars 7,164 million in 2017

as opposed to the growth of 3.7 per cent witnessed

in 2016. The downward trend observed in workers’

remittances can be largely attributable to the

sluggishness of the global economy and prevailing

geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle Eastern

region, coupled with the low oil prices, which

have led to a decline in the income level of source

countries. Moreover, according to data provided

by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment,

labour migration for foreign employment under all

skill categories declined, reducing overall labour

migration significantly by 12.6 per cent during 2017

in comparison to the previous year. Expansion in

the domestic labour market and continuation of

several policy measures taken by the government

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

167

5

to discourage the migration of housemaids and

unskilled workers are some of the main reasons for

the decline in departures for foreign employment.

These policy measures included the provision of

family background reports and the imposition of

a minimum age which mainly impacted female

migrant workers. Further, foreign employment

opportunities offered for Sri Lankans during the

year have been limited due to barriers such as the

rise in the number of Sri Lankan illegal migrant

workers and visa over-stayers, acute shortage

of skilled labour demanded by foreign employers

and inadequate language proficiency of migrant

employees, particularly in the unskilled employee

category including housemaids, causing labour

migration to decline. Meanwhile, the receipts in the

form of government transfers also declined during

the year. As a result, inflows to the secondary

income account amounted to US dollars 7,175

million during the year 2017, marking a decline of

1.2 per cent over the preceding year.

5.5 Current Account Balance

Widened trade deficit, and higher outflows

from the primary income account coupled with

the moderation in tourist earnings and the

decline in workers’ remittances weighed down

the external current account in 2017. Despite

the gradual pickup in export earnings since March

2017, the trade balance deteriorated substantially

as increased export earnings were insufficient to

offset the notable increase in import expenditure.

The upsurge in import expenditure was mainly

driven by weather related imports such as rice

and fuel. Higher importation of gold and base

metals also contributed to the significant rise in

import expenditure in 2017. Meanwhile, inflows

to the secondary income account originating from

workers’ remittances were subdued during the year

whilst the deficit in the primary income account

widened due to increased reinvested earnings of

DIEs and interest payments. However, the growth

in earnings from tourism, transport and computer

services sub-sectors helped reduce the deficit in

the external current account to a certain extent.

Reflecting these developments, the current account

deficit widened to US dollars 2,309 million in 2017,

from US dollars 1,742 million in 2016. As a per cent

of GDP, the current account deficit, in 2017, was

2.6 per cent, in comparison to 2.1 per cent in 2016.

5.6 Capital Account Balance

The capital account remained subdued with

lower inflows in the form of capital transfers

in 2017. Capital transfers to both the government

and the private sector recorded a marginal decline

during 2017 vis-a-vis the previous year. Accordingly,

the surplus in the capital account amounted to US

dollars 11 million in 2017 in comparison to US

dollars 25 million in 2016.

5.7 Financial Account

Both net incurrence of liabilities and net

acquisition of assets to the financial account

increased significantly in 2017, in comparison

to 2016. Higher inflows to the financial account, as

against outflows witnessed during 2017, resulted in

a significant increase in net incurrence of liabilities

in 2017. Further, the significant accumulation

of gross official reserves resulted in a notable

increase in the net acquisition of assets during

the year. On a net basis, incurrence of liabilities

amounted to US dollars 5,128 million in 2017,

compared to US dollars 2,213 million in 2016,

while net acquisition of financial assets amounted

to US dollars 2,944 million, compared to US dollars

31 million in 2016. Significant disinvestments by

foreign investors from the government securities

market, witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2016,

continued in the first quarter of 2017, against the

backdrop of heightened anticipation of further

interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve of

the United States. This necessitated continuous

intervention from the Central Bank in the foreign

exchange market, resulting in a sharp decline in

gross official reserves in the first quarter of 2017.

In addition, a currency swap arrangement with

the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) amounting to US

dollars 400 million also matured in the first quarter

of 2017. However, inflows to the financial account

increased significantly from the second quarter of

2017, with a notable reversal of outflows in respect

of foreign investments in government securities,

reflecting increased investor confidence arising

from improved overall macroeconomic stability and

the continuation of the IMF EFF programme, with

two more tranches being approved during 2017.

The financial account was further strengthened with

the highest ever annual inflow of FDI, supported

by foreign investments in the Hambantota Port

Project, Colombo Port City Project and investments

in the telecommunications sector and other mixed

development projects. In addition, the issuance of

an ISB amounting to US dollars 1.5 billion and the

receipt of US dollars 1 billion from the proceeds

of a foreign currency term financing facility also

supported the financial account. An increase

was observed in both foreign loan inflows and

repayments by the private sector and state owned

business enterprises (SOBEs) during the year.

Further, the banking sector increased its foreign

liabilities in the form of foreign loans and trade

credits and advances while the BOC repaid an

international bond of US dollars 500 million during

2017. These developments together with significant

net purchases from the foreign exchange market

by the Central Bank from March 2017 onwards

resulted in a significant increase in gross official

reserves by end-2017.

5.7.1 Direct Investment

Foreign direct investment (FDI), which

includes foreign borrowings of Board of

Investment (BOI) companies, recorded the

highest inflows in history in 2017. Accordingly,

total FDI inflows, including foreign loans received

by companies registered with the BOI, amounted

to US dollars 1,913 million in 2017, in comparison

to US dollars 1,078 million in 2016. FDI, excluding

foreign loans obtained by BOI companies, also

recorded a noteworthy increase amounting to US

dollars 1,375 million, in 2017, in comparison to US

dollars 897 million in 2016. FDI inflows, excluding

foreign loans to BOI companies, comprised of US

dollars 32 million of net investments in equity, US

dollars 503 million of reinvested earnings and US

dollars 840 million of net intercompany debt during

the year. Further, foreign loans obtained by BOI

companies from non-related parties amounted

to US dollars 538 million in 2017 compared to

US dollars 181 million in 2016. Major inflows of

FDI included receipts to Hambantota port project

and the Colombo Port City project. Both projects

are expected to attract a significant amount of

FDI in 2018 and beyond, thereby supporting the

sustainable improvement in the external sector

through much needed non-debt creating foreign

exchange inflows. On a sectoral basis, major

inflows were received by ports, housing and

property development, telecommunications and

hotel sectors. In addition, the manufacturing sector

received a moderate amount of FDI during the

year. Based on the origin of the immediate investor,

China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia and Singapore

were the top five source countries of FDI in 2017.

Meanwhile, net acquisition of assets in the form of

direct investment abroad by Sri Lankan companies

amounted to US dollars 72 million, compared to US

dollars 237 million in 2016. FDI outflows in 2016

were considerably higher than the normal trend

in 2017, particularly due to some major outward

investment by the Sri Lankan apparel sector.

5.7.2 Portfolio Investment

Equity

Portfolio investment in equity, through non-

FDI foreign investment in the CSE, recorded a

notable increase in 2017. Portfolio investment in

equity accounts for individual foreign investment

of less than 10 per cent of the total shareholding

of a Sri Lankan enterprise and consists of foreign

investments in the CSE, that are not classified

as direct investment transactions. Accordingly,

portfolio investment in the form of equity recorded

a net inflow of US dollars 359 million during

2017. This included net inflows to the secondary

market amounting to US dollars 202 million and

primary market inflows amounting to US dollars

157 million. This was a sharp increase compared

to the moderate net inflow of portfolio investment

in the form of equity amounting to US dollars 24

million in 2016. The positive change in investor

sentiment from March 2017 onwards, which

was also witnessed in foreign investment in the

government securities market, mainly contributed

to the healthy growth in foreign investment in both

FDI and portfolio equity investment during 2017.

Debt Securities

Foreign investment in debt securities was

the main inflow to the financial account in 2017.

Sri Lanka successfully issued the eleventh ISB

amounting to US dollars 1.5 billion, while receiving

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

170

5

a significant amount of foreign investment in

Treasury bonds in 2017. The eleventh ISB with

a maturity period of ten years was issued at

a competitive coupon rate of 6.20 per cent

during a time of increasing global interest rates,

exhibiting continued investor confidence on

Sri Lanka’s macroeconomic fundamentals.

This was complemented with significant foreign

investment in Treasury bonds, amounting to

a net inflow of US dollars 360 million in 2017,

compared to a net outflow of US dollars 361

million in 2016. Overall, foreign investment in

Treasury bills, Treasury bonds and Sri Lanka

Development Bonds (SLDB) amounted to a net

inflow of US dollars 413 million in 2017, despite

a net outflow of US dollars 415 million in the first

quarter of 2017. The main outflow in respect of

debt securities during 2017 was the maturity of

a five-year international bond of US dollars 500

million issued by the BOC. Meanwhile, assets

corporations remained relatively unchanged

during 2017.

5.7.3 Other Investment

2,535 million, which consisted of a sum of US

dollars one billion received from two tranches of

a foreign currency term financing facility and the

rest in the form of long term project loans. Major

inflows to government projects during 2017

included loan proceeds for the construction of

extension of southern expressway section 1, 2 and

4, construction of outer circular highway project

phase III, integrated road investment programme

- tranche 3, Hambantota hub development project,

second health sector development project, greater

Colombo transmission and distribution loss

reduction project, water supply and sanitation

improvement project and additional financing for

dam safety and water resources planning project.

Meanwhile, the Central Bank, on behalf of the

government of Sri Lanka, received two tranches

under the IMF EFF programme amounting to US

dollars 419 million in 2017. In terms of loan inflows

to the private sector and SOBEs, the private sector

received US dollars 535 million in 2017, while loan

inflows of US dollars 182 million was received by

SOBEs during the year.

Repayment of foreign loans by all sectors

remained significantly high in 2017. Total

foreign loan repayments by the government

amounted to US dollars 1,320 million in 2017, and

consisted of repayments on account of the foreign

currency term financing facility of US dollars

280 million and the remainder as repayments in

respect of long term project loans. The Central

Bank completed the repayment of the IMF Stand-

By Arrangement facility from 2009-2012 in full by

June 2017. Meanwhile, foreign loans obtained by

deposit taking corporations recorded a net inflow

of US dollars 271 million in 2017. Repayments of

foreign loans by the private sector and SOBEs

amounted to US dollars 362 million and US dollars

186 million, respectively, during the year.

Overall, inflows to the financial account

in the form of loans were higher than loan

repayments, and the resultant net inflow of

foreign loans was higher in 2017 compared

to 2016. Compared to a net loan inflow of US

dollars 793 million in 2016, net inflow of loans to

the financial account in 2017 amounted to US

dollars 1,839 million. This increase consisted of

net increases in loan liabilities by the government,

the Central Bank, deposit taking corporations and

private sector, amounting to US dollars 1,215

million, US dollars 184 million, US dollars 271

million and US dollars 173 million, respectively,

while SOBEs recorded a net loan outflow of US

dollars 4 million in 2017.

Trade Credit and Advances and Other Accounts Receivable / Payable

Trade credits and advances received from

non-residents and extended to non-residents

recorded an increase in 2017. Trade credits

and advances received from non-residents rose

primarily due to higher oil purchases on credit by

the CPC, in comparison to repayments made during

2017. Trade credits received by private companies

and SOBEs other than CPC also increased during

2017 compared to a reduction in 2016, in line with

the notable growth in goods imports during the

year. Consequently, net incurrence in trade credit

and advances amounted to US dollars 309 million,

in 2017, compared to an increase of US dollars

84 million in 2016. Meanwhile, trade credits and

advances given by Sri Lankan companies and the

banking sector to non-residents also increased by

US dollars 54 million in comparison to a decrease

of US dollars 118 million in 2016. Trade credits

to non-residents were primarily provided by

Sri Lankan companies in the apparel sector in

2017. Meanwhile, other accounts payable, primarily

consisting of Asian Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities

managed by the Central Bank increased by US

dollars 61 million, while other accounts receivable

by deposit taking corporations reduced by US

dollars 31 million in 2017.

5.7.4 Reserve Assets

In line with the increase in the reserve asset

position, transactions related to reserve assets

recorded a significant increase during 2017.

The net increase in reserve asset transactions of

US dollars 2,771 million was a significant contrast

to the net decline in reserve assets transactions

of US dollars 472 million in 2016. The increase

in reserve assets constituted an increase in fixed

income securities transactions by US dollars 2,375

million and an increase in currency and deposits

by US dollars 393 million. The increased inflows to

gross official reserves facilitated higher investment

in US dollar denominated long term fixed income

securities by the Central Bank during the year.

Similar to 2016, there were no transactions in

monetary gold during 2017.

5.8 Overall Balance

Reflecting improvements in the financial

account, the overall balance recorded a

surplus in 2017, after recording deficits for

two consecutive years. Significant inflows to

the financial account, including the proceeds of

the ISB, proceeds from the foreign currency term

financing facility, net project and programme loans

received by the government, issuance of Sri Lanka

Development Bonds and a significant net absorption

of foreign exchange by the Central Bank resulted in

net international reserves increasing to US dollars

6,597 million by end-2017 from US dollars 4,529

million at end-2016. Consequently, the overall

balance, which is also the difference between the

change in net international reserves during the two

periods, amounted to US dollars 2,068 million in

2017 against a deficit of US dollars 500 million in

2016.

Position

In terms of the International Investment

Position (IIP), which shows the value and

external assets and liabilities with the rest of

the world, Sri Lanka’s external liability position

as well as the asset position increased as at

end-2017 compared to that of 2016. The total

foreign assets increased to US dollars 12,366

million, primarily due to the increase in the

reserve asset position, while the asset position

of direct investment, trade credits and advances,

and currency and deposits also contributed to

this increase. Meanwhile, the total foreign liability

position increased from US dollars 54,857 million

at end 2016 to US dollars 60,721 million at end-

2017, primarily due to the increase in direct

investment, portfolio investment, outstanding

loan liabilities and trade credit positions. The net

liability position of the IIP increased to US dollars

48,355 million as at end-2017 from US dollars

44,591 million at end-2016, with the increase

in the foreign liability position outweighing the

increase in the foreign asset position. Despite

Sri Lanka’s net IIP continuing to be negative,

inflows in the form of direct investment and other

non-debt creating inflows to the financial account

have shown an improvement during the year.

5.9.1 Direct Investment Position

Significant inflow of direct investment

resulted in an increase in the direct investment

liability position as at end-2017. Accordingly,

reflecting the highest historical inflows of annual

FDI, increase in direct investment equity as well

as outstanding intercompany debt positions, the

direct investment liability position increased to

US dollars 11,070 million as at end-2017, from

US dollars 9,845 million at end-2016. Valuation

losses of direct investment in the form of equity

were moderated in 2017 compared to significant

valuation losses of tradable equity securities in

the CSE in 2016. Based on immediate country of

investment, Netherlands, India, China, Malaysia

and Singapore were the top five countries with the

highest direct investment liability stock positions as

at end-2017. Meanwhile, direct investment abroad

by Sri Lankan residents recorded an outstanding

asset position of US dollars 1,278 million by end-

2017, an increase of 4.8 per cent from the previous

year.

5.9.2 Portfolio Investment Position

The portfolio investment liability position

increased with the proceeds from the

eleventh ISB and the increase in outstanding

foreign investments in treasury bonds while

outstanding debt securities position of the

banking sector decreased as at end-2017.

Accordingly, the stock position of portfolio

investment liabilities increased from US dollars

13,684 million at end-2016 to US dollars 15,578

million at end-2017. The portfolio investment

equity liability position increased marginally to

US dollars 1,491 million by the end of the year

as a result of notable valuation losses despite

the increase in net inflow of foreign investment to

the CSE. Meanwhile, the debt securities liability

position increased during 2017 primarily due to

the proceeds through the issuance of the ISB

amounting to US dollars 1,500 million, and the

increase in the outstanding foreign investment

position of treasury bonds despite the debt

securities liability position of deposit taking

corporations recording a decline as a result of the

settlement of the International Bond amounting

to US dollars 500 million by the BOC during the

year. The market value of the outstanding ISBs

increased with significant gain in market prices

and amounted to US dollars 10,347 million

compared to face value of US dollars 9,650

million as at end-2017.

5.9.3 Other Investment Position

Currency and Deposits

The currency and deposit asset position

increased while the liability position declined as

at the end 2017. The currency and deposit liability

position of the Central Bank declined, primarily due to

the settlement of the international swap arrangement

with RBI amounting to US dollars 400 million in March

2017. The currency and deposit liability position of

deposit taking corporations increased to US dollars

2,212 million while the asset position of deposit taking

corporations also increased to US dollars 784 million

at end-2017, in line with the moderate increase in

total assets of the banking sector during 2017.

Loans

The foreign loan liability position in the IIP

increased at the end of 2017 primarily due to

the increase in the foreign loan liability position

of the government, deposit taking corporations

and the Central Bank. Accordingly, the foreign loan

liability position increased from US dollars 26,342

million at end-2016 to US dollars 28,912 million at the

end of 2017. The foreign loan liability position of the

government increased to US dollars 19,201 million at

end-2017 from US dollars 17,295 million at end-2016,

primarily due to new project loans and proceeds of

US dollars one billion on account of two new foreign

currency term financing facilities. The outstanding

government loans denominated in foreign currencies

other than US dollars, which constitute around

38 per cent of the total outstanding foreign loans,

increased significantly when converted to US dollars

as a result of the significant depreciation of the US

dollar against all major foreign currencies during

2017. The outstanding foreign loans of deposit taking

corporations and private sector corporations also

increased during the year. Further, the outstanding

loan position of the Central Bank increased due to

the receipt of the third and fourth tranches of the IMF

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

175

EFF facility while the remaining outstanding liabilities

of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) facility was

fully repaid during 2017.

Trade Credit and Advances

The outstanding liability position of trade

credit and advances received, and the asset

position of trade credit and advances given

increased during 2017. The trade credit and

advances liability position of the private sector

increased to US dollars 1,790 million at end-2017

from US dollars 1,480 million at end-2016, primarily

due to the increase in outstanding trade credits of

CPC. Trade credit and advances given by deposit

taking corporations and the private sector, which

account for the trade credit and advances asset

position, increased to US dollars 761 million as at

end-2017 from US dollars 707 million at end-2016.

Other Accounts Receivable / Payable and Special Drawing Rights

The outstanding position of other accounts

receivable declined while other accounts

payable increased in 2017. The outstanding

position of other accounts receivable, consisting of

short term outstanding positions of deposit taking

corporations, declined to US dollars 1,584 million as

at end-2017. Meanwhile, the outstanding position

of other accounts payable, which consists of ACU

related liabilities of the Central Bank, increased to

US dollars 594 million at the end of 2017. Further,

the outstanding position of Special Drawing Rights

increased from US dollars 532 million at end-2016

to US dollars 563 million at end-2017.

5.9.4 Reserve Asset Position

Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves improved,

both in terms of quantity and quality, and

reached a healthy level of US dollars 8.0 billion

as at end-2017 from US dollars 6.0 billion at end-

2016. The gross official reserves position improved

mainly due to the absorption of foreign exchange

from the domestic foreign exchange market and

other foreign exchange inflows such as proceeds of

the ISB, foreign currency term financing facility, IMF

EFF facility and the first tranche of the investment

proceeds on account of handing over operations of

the Hambantota port to the China Merchant Port

Holdings Company Ltd. The level of gross official

reserves of the country at end-2017 was equivalent

to finance 4.6 months of imports of goods. A

notable improvement in the quality of reserves was

witnessed during the year, with an improvement

in the amount of organic reserves in the form of

purchases of foreign exchange from the domestic

foreign exchange market, amounting to US dollars

1,664 million on a net basis during the year and

retiring of foreign exchange swap arrangements

with domestic banks by around US dollars 1 billion.

The build-up of gross official reserves through

direct absorption of foreign exchange enabled the

Central Bank to meet the net international reserve

targets under the IMF EFF programme. Reflecting

both quantitative and qualitative improvements in

international reserves, the reserve asset position

covered 63.3 per cent of the country's short term

debt and liabilities as at end-2017. Meanwhile,

total foreign assets, which consists of gross

official reserves and foreign assets of deposit

taking corporations, also increased to US dollars

10.4 billion at end-2017, equivalent to finance 6.0

months of imports, from US dollars 8.4 billion as

at end-2016. The notable increase was primarily

due to the increase in gross official reserves, while

foreign assets of the banking sector remained at

similar levels by end-2017, compared to end-2016.

5.10 External Debt and Debt Servicing

5.10.1 External Debt

Sri Lanka’s total external debt rose in 2017

mainly with the increase in the external debt of

the general government. Total external debt of the

country increased by US dollars 5.4 billion to US

dollars 51,824 million by end-2017. The government

raised around US dollars 4.0 billion in 2017 by issuing

an ISB, raising a foreign currency term financing

facility and programme and project loans. Positive

net inflows to the government securities market

further contributed to the higher external debt position

of the government. Despite the receipt of US dollars

419 million under the IMF EFF during the year, the

outstanding external debt of the Central Bank declined

to US dollars 1,924 million by end-2017, from US

dollars 2,022 million reported at end-2016, due to the

repayment of US dollars 235 million under IMF SBA

facility and the settlement of the international foreign

currency swap arrangement with RBI amounting to

US dollars 400 million. Outstanding external debt of

deposit taking corporations declined by US dollars

79 million to US dollars 8,711 million, mainly due to

the decline in debt securities holdings of commercial

banks. Further, a notable increase was recorded

in the outstanding external debt of private sector

corporations, SOBEs and intercompany lending of

direct investment enterprises during 2017.

With the increase in government external debt,

the total outstanding external debt of the country as

a percentage of GDP increased to 59.5 per cent by

end-2017 from 56.8 per cent at end-2016. However,

reflecting a positive development, the long-term portion

of the total external debt increased, albeit marginally,

to 85.2 per cent by end-2017, compared to 84.2 per

cent at end-2016, with a parallel decline in short-term

debt, showing a smooth transition towards longer-term

maturities. Subsequent to the increase in government

external debt, the share of government debt in total

outstanding external debt stood at 60.7 per cent by end-

2017 compared to 58.6 per cent at end-2016.

5.10.2 Foreign Debt Service

Payments

Foreign debt service payments, which

consist of capital repayments and interest

payments on Sri Lanka’s external debt,

continued to increase in 2017. Capital repayments

decreased to US dollars 3,156 million in 2017 from

US dollars 3,243 million in 2016, of which general

government accounted for US dollars 1,354 million.

The repayment of US dollars 1,320 million of long-

term foreign loans obtained for financing projects

implemented by the government mainly contributed

to the increased debt amortization by the government.

However, repayments by the Central Bank declined to

US dollars 635 million in 2017, from US dollars 1,555

million in 2016. This included the settlement of the

international currency swap arrangement with RBI

and the settlement of the IMF SBA facility. In contrast,

repayments by the private sector and deposit taking

corporations increased due to the settlement of an

International Bond issued by the BOC amounting to

US dollars 500 million. Interest payments increased,

albeit moderately, during the year to US dollars 1,405

million, from US dollars 1,219 million in 2016. The

decline in interest payments by the private sector and

deposit taking corporations was outweighed mainly

by the increase in interest payments on the general

government debt obligations. Since the surge in

debt service payments was lower than the increase

in earnings from merchandise exports and services,

total external debt service payments as a percentage

of the export of merchandise goods and services

declined to 23.9 per cent in 2017 from 25.6 per cent

in 2016. Further, as government debt represents the

major part of the country’s debt stock, government

debt service payments accounted for 53.0 per cent of

total debt service payments in 2017.

The bunching of maturities of external sector

liabilities, particularly with ISBs maturing in the

period from 2019 to 2023 is a concern in the

external sector over the short to medium-term.

The enactment of the Active Liability Management

Act, in 2018, provides the legal framework for prudent

public debt management. It constitutes a major

step taken to address current issues in public debt

management, including the bunching of maturities.

The overall increase in external debt of the country

will also have a significant impact on the external

current account through higher interest payments.

The global interest rates demonstrate an increasing

trend due to recent interest rate hikes announced by

the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States with

expectations of further hikes by major central banks.

The rise in interest rates is likely to have an impact on

Sri Lanka’s external sector by way of increasing debt

servicing cost.

implemented by the Central Bank during the

year, limiting Central Bank intervention in

the foreign exchange market only to build-

up international reserves. The significant

depreciation pressure on the rupee that

prevailed particularly during the first two months

of 2017 due to continued outflows stemming

from import expenditure, debt service payments

and unwinding of foreign investments in the

government securities market necessitated the

Central Bank to supply foreign currency liquidity

to the domestic foreign exchange market to

defend the external value of the Sri Lankan

rupee. However, this situation turned around

from March 2017, particularly with higher foreign

investments to the CSE and the government

securities market and increased conversion of

export proceeds, which provided an opportunity

for the Central Bank to absorb foreign exchange

liquidity from the market. The depreciation

pressure on the rupee further eased gradually

from May onwards with the issuance of the ISB,

the receipt of the foreign currency term financing

facility, and disbursement of the third and the

fourth tranches of the IMF EFF programme,

which helped improve investor confidence. This

situation contributed towards the stability of the

rupee against the US dollar during the period

from end-March to end-December 2017, even

with some periods of gradual appreciation of the

rupee amidst substantial absorption of foreign

exchange liquidity by the Central Bank. With these

developments, the rupee, which depreciated by

1.28 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, recorded

an overall depreciation of 2.00 per cent against

the US dollar during the year, from Rs. 149.80 at

end-2016 to Rs. 152.85 at end-2017. In addition,

the annual average exchange rate depreciated

by 4.50 per cent to Rs. 152.46 against the US

dollar in 2017.

Reflecting movements in cross-currency

exchange rates against the US dollar in

international markets, the rupee depreciated

markedly against all other major currencies

in 2017, in comparison to the previous year.

Accordingly, the exchange rate of the Sri Lankan

rupee depreciated against the euro by 13.49

per cent, the Indian rupee by 7.54 per cent, the

Japanese yen by 5.10 per cent, and the pound

sterling by 10.46 per cent. With the combined

effect of the depreciation of the rupee against

major currencies, the Sri Lankan rupee also

depreciated against the SDR by 7.49 per cent

during the year.

5.11.1 Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates

Effective exchange rate indices (2010=100),

which measure the movement of the

Sri Lankan rupee against a basket of currencies,

depreciated during the year. Nominal Effective

Exchange Rate (NEER) indices depreciated,

reflecting the nominal depreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee against the dollar and other

major currencies considered in the basket. The

5-currency NEER index depreciated by 8.68 per

cent, while the 24-currency index depreciated by

7.75 per cent in 2017. Meanwhile, Real Effective

Exchange Rate (REER) indices, an indicator of

Sri Lanka’s external competitiveness that takes into

account the inflation differential among countries

in addition to the variation in nominal exchange

rates, also depreciated during the year. Based on

5-currency and 24-currency REER baskets, REER

indices depreciated, by 4.83 per cent and 4.85 per

cent, respectively, getting closer to the 100-index

point mark. Although the behaviour of REER

indices indicated an improvement in the external

competitiveness of the rupee, REER indices

remained above 100 due to relatively high inflation

experienced by the country.

5.11.2 Developments in the Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The spot market, which was not very active

in 2016, revived in 2017 in response to the

implementation of the more market-based

exchanges rate policy by the Central Bank, while

the volume of forward transactions declined,

albeit marginally. With the increase in spot market

transactions, the total volume of transactions in

the domestic foreign exchange market increased

notably during the year to US dollars 16,451

million, from US dollars 14,780 million in 2016. The

volume of spot transactions increased substantially

to US dollars 8,426 million (51.2 per cent of total

transactions) in 2017 from US dollars 6,072 million

in 2016. The total volume of forward transactions

decreased to US dollars 8,025 million in 2017

from US dollars 8,709 million in 2016. Meanwhile,

the presence of the Central Bank in the domestic

foreign exchange market resulted in an absorption

of US dollars 1,664 million, on a net basis, in 2017.

This included an absorption of US dollars 2,214

million and a supply of US dollars 550 million. This

was a complete turnaround in terms of intervention

by the Central Bank, in 2017, compared to the

previous year, in which the Central Bank supplied

foreign exchange liquidity amounting to US dollars

1,900 million while purchasing US dollars 1,132

million. The higher level of net absorption in 2017

was particularly due to the improvement in foreign

exchange inflows in the last three quarters of the

year, which enabled the Central Bank to limit its

intervention in absorbing excess foreign liquidity to

build-up gross official reserves of the country. The

absorption of foreign exchange helped the Central

Bank to meet international reserve targets set

under the IMF EFF.

Movements of one-month forward premia and

Net Open Position (NOP) of commercial banks

reflected foreign exchange market participants’

near-term expectations of a depreciation in

the exchange rate in 2017. Accordingly, the

forward premia for one-month contracts remained

above the average of interest rate differentials

during 2017. Meanwhile, indicating near-term

depreciation expectations of the market, NOP

of commercial banks also remained at a positive

level, on average, during the year. However,

forward premia for three-months and six-months

remained below interest rate differentials during the

year, indicating expectations of an improvement in

foreign exchange inflows in the short run.

1. Introduction

Foreign exchange transactions in Sri Lanka, which were subject to substantial controls, were partly liberalised in line with broader economic reforms under the open economic policy regime introduced in 1977. Trade liberalization, which took place with the introduction of open economic policies, could be considered as the platform on which the gradual liberalisation of foreign exchange transactions has taken place over the period. After accepting the IMF Articles VIII in 1994, the current account was substantially liberalized allowing free flow of foreign exchange for current transactions. Further, capital transactions, especially capital inflows, have been substantially liberalized since 1977 while capital outflows have been partially liberalized to facilitate cross border investments. However, for any outward capital transaction exceeding the permitted threshold limit, prior approval of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) was needed to be obtained. Nevertheless, persons holding foreign currency accounts were permitted to use funds in such accounts for any purpose outside the country including for capital transactions.

A new legislative and policy framework for foreign exchange transactions was introduced on 20th November 2017 (appointed date) with the enactment of the Foreign Exchange Act No 12 of 2017 (FEA). The FEA aims integrating the domestic capital market with the global capital market through further liberalization of capital flows and simplification of the processes associated with foreign exchange transactions.

2. Salient features of FEA

2.1 Administration of the Act

The FEA has vested the responsibility of the promotion and regulation of foreign exchange in CBSL as the agent of the Government of Sri Lanka, in accordance with the directions issued by the Minister who is assigned with the ‘subject of the Central Bank’ (the Minister). The provisions of FEA are implemented through the newly established Department of Foreign Exchange (DFE), headed by the Director of Foreign Exchange. This arrangement is largely similar to the empowerment under the repealed Exchange Control Act, No. 24 of 1953 (ECA).

2.2 Powers of the Minister

Under FEA, following powers are vested with the Minister.

a. Issuing directions to the Monetary Board to carry out provisions of the Act.

BOX 05Further Liberalization of Foreign Exchange Transactions under the Foreign ExchangeAct, No. 12 of 2017

b. Prescribing purposes for which CBSL can grant special permission to any person to deal in foreign exchange within Sri Lanka.

c. Authorizing by regulations in consultation with the Monetary Board, the class or classes of capital transactions.

d. Authorizing by regulations in consultation with the Monetary Board, the accounts maintained under FEA.

e. Prescribing by order published in the Gazette, purposes, limits, terms and conditions for export/import of foreign currency/Sri Lanka currency and possession of foreign currency.

f. Prescribing by order published in the Gazette, “a person resident in Sri Lanka”.

g. Approving guidelines and directions to be issued by CBSL to:

• Authorized dealers (ADs)/restricted dealers

(RDs) on capital transactions and other transactions• other persons• ADs/RDs on failure to comply with provisions

of the Acth. Appointment, removal and deciding remuneration of members of the Board of Inquiry for dealing with appeals.

i. Restricting or regulating remittances of foreign exchange in and out, on the advice of the Monetary Board and with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers for a period not exceeding 6 months, which could be extended for a further aggregate period of up to 12 months, where there is a potential threat to financial stability. Currently the Monetary Law Act has delegated such power to the Monetary Board.

2.3 Persons authorised to deal in foreign exchange

Under the ECA, Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) were the sole agents permitted to engage in foreign exchange transactions as ADs whereas FEA has broadened the scope and accessibility to deal in foreign exchange by identifying three broad categories of persons as follows:

a. ADs: ADs include both LCBs and Licensed Specialized Banks (LSBs). All LCBs existed as at the appointed date were deemed to be authorized by CBSL to act as ADs, while other LCBs from the date of issuance of a banking license shall be authorized by CBSL to act as

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

183

5

ADs. All LSBs existed as at the appointed date and new LSBs to be licensed shall also be authorized by CBSL to deal in foreign exchange for the purposes specified in such authorization.

b. RDs: In addition to ADs, CBSL may permit any class or classes of persons to deal in foreign exchange within Sri Lanka for the purposes specified in such permission. RDs include money changers or any person other than LCBs and LSBs, which were at the appointed date permitted to deal in foreign exchange.

c. Persons other than ADs and RDs: CBSL may also grant special permission to any person not being an AD or RD to deal in foreign exchange within Sri Lanka for purposes prescribed by the Minister by an order published in the Gazette.

The ADs, RDs and other permitted persons are required to deal in permitted foreign exchange transactions exercising their due diligence and establishing bona fide of such transactions. CBSL’s involvement is primarily to discipline the foreign exchange market through the issuance of prudential regulations focused on macro level surveillance.

2.4 Permitted transactions

The FEA categorises transactions broadly as current, capital and other transactions, to accommodate possible transactions that may arise in the future, with consideration of the industry dynamics.

a. Current transactions: Current transactions are categorized under the following 4 broad categories in line with IMF Articles XXX (d) and can be carried out through both ADs and RDs to the extent of permission granted.

(i) Payments connected with foreign trade, other current business, including services and normal short term banking and credit facilities,

(ii) Payments due as interest on loans and net income from other investments,

(iii) Payment of moderate amounts for amortization of loans or for depreciation of direct investments, and

(iv) Payments for moderate remittances for family living expenses.

Items (iii) and (iv) above were not considered as current transactions under ECA and only ADs were permitted to engage in current transactions.

b. Capital transactions: Cross border transactions other than current transactions are defined as capital transactions. The class or classes of capital transactions shall be authorised by regulations made by the Minister, in consultation with the

Monetary Board and with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. Persons who are entitled to deal in foreign exchange with respect to permitted capital transactions can carry out such transactions through ADs or RDs to the extent permitted.

c. Other transactions: Transactions other than capital and current for which CBSL may from time to time issue directions and guidelines with the approval of the Minister.

d. No person residing in Sri Lanka shall deal in foreign exchange within or outside Sri Lanka which involves conversion of Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) or assets within Sri Lanka to foreign exchange other than through an AD or a RD, unless provided in the Act

e. Any person in or residing in Sri Lanka who holds foreign exchange in a bank account in Sri Lanka or outside Sri Lanka, or owns any foreign assets that has not been derived:

(i) from the conversion of rupees or the disposal or the conversion of any financial or real asset within Sri Lanka, or

(ii) by an AD or a RD from the business of dealing in foreign exchange,

may utilise such foreign exchange for making any payment for current or capital account transaction of such person within or outside Sri Lanka. If such payment is made from Sri Lanka, it should be through an AD or RD

f. A person shall import or export foreign currency or hold any foreign exchange in his/her possession or in a bank account and import and export Sri Lanka currency only for purposes and up to limits prescribed by the Minister by order published in the Gazette.

g. If a resident in Sri Lanka remits foreign exchange to Sri Lanka which:

(i) does not involve rupees converted to foreign exchange or any disposal / conversion of any financial or real assets within Sri Lanka,

(ii) has not been declared to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue or Exchange Control Department and

3. Regulations, Orders and Directions issued under FEA

3.1 Regulations issued under FEA

The following three regulations and two orders were issued by the Minister in terms of the provisions of FEA.

a) Foreign Exchange (Capital Transactions in Foreign Exchange Carried on by ADs) Regulations No. 1 of 2017

Foreign investors prefer investing in countries that do not have exit restrictions and clear policy guidelines. The new regulations guided by the broader concept of unrestricted inflows and outflows were mainly focused on further liberalisation of the capital account, by gradually shifting from a controlling regime to a facilitating regime. Attracting new foreign investments/inflows, while creating clarity, transparency, customer convenience, extending investment avenues for economic agents, enhancing limits of certain capital transactions and ensuring the

availability of extended services were main objectives of the new policy initiatives. Under this policy regime, general permission was granted to ADs to deal in foreign exchange transactions, which were subject to the approval of the regulator under the previous regime. The introduction of this convenient procedure, by removing bottlenecks would strengthen the competitive position of Sri Lanka and enhance the ease of doing business with the rest of the world. Regulations No. 1 of 2017 has further relaxed the capital account of the Balance of Payments by way of creating opportunities for entrepreneurs to invest abroad, mainly to gain international sophistication in the areas of technology and marketing, while enabling them to understand the international business culture and connect to the global value chain. Accordingly, the main relaxations on capital inflows and outflows are as follows:

(i) Overseas Investments by residents: Increasing the threshold limits of outward capital transactions and broadening the categories of outward investments, while such investments are facilitated by services provided by ADs (Table B 5.1).

(ii) Investments in Sri Lanka by non-residents: The areas available for non-residents to invest in Sri Lanka were broadened by including fixed deposits in LSBs, Licensed Finance Companies, Licensed Micro Finance Companies and Licensed Leasing Companies regulated by CBSL in addition to the previously permitted fixed deposits with ADs (LCBs). Further, investors are now allowed to invest in securities issued by CBSL or any other statutory body, shares in companies not incorporated in Sri Lanka and listed in the CSE. This is to create new opportunities and enhance investment avenues for prospective investors, with a view to attracting capital inflows to Sri Lanka on a permanent basis.

(iii) Migrants’ Fund transfer: The decade old limits of migration allowances (both initial allowance and annual allowance) were also enhanced with a view to facilitating Sri Lankan origin migrants. Permission was granted to ADs to transfer enhanced migration allowances through Capital Transactions Rupee Accounts (CTRAs) maintained with ADs upon submitting the relevant documents, without obtaining prior permission of CBSL (Table B 5.2).

(iv) Loans to Sri Lankans working abroad: A single scheme of loans for Sri Lankans employed abroad was introduced by amalgamating previously existing three types of loan schemes, to simplify applicable regulations and promote foreign exchange earnings from migrant workers, in recognition of the valuable contribution they make to the national economy.

b) Foreign Exchange (Opening and Maintenance of Accounts for engaging in Capital Transactions) Regulations No. 2 of 2017

Around 17 different types of foreign currency accounts created under ECA were reclassified for simplicity and operational convenience. Regulations 2 and 3 are mainly focused on simplifying the complex structure of foreign currency and LKR accounts opened and maintained under ECA. Regulations 2 deals with opening and maintenance of five types of foreign currency accounts or LKR accounts, to deal in capital transactions. (Table B 5.3).

3.2 Orders issued under FEA

a) Order determining purposes, limits, terms and conditions on import, export and possession of foreign currency and LKR

In terms of this Order, any person arriving in to or departing from Sri Lanka can carry any amount of foreign currency subject to declaration requirements in Table B 5.5. Accordingly, the declaration thresholds under ECA have been enhanced under FEA.

b) Order determining residential status of a person

A new criterion for determining a person’s residential status was introduced based on the aggregate number of days spent in Sri Lanka (i.e. 183 days or more), rather than focusing on permanent place of abode as required under ECA. This is in conformity with other international standards and applicable legislations such as the Inland Revenue Act. It is also intended to eliminate ambiguities in the determination of residency under the previous regime.

3.3 Directions Issued to ADs

The DFE has issued 15 Directions to ADs as operating instructions to facilitate implementing the regulations and orders. All these Regulations, Orders and Directions issued under FEA can be accessed by the general public from the website www.dfe.lk

4. Concluding Remarks

Although policies are formulated and legislation is in place, effective implementation is necessary to attain the desired outcome of the FEA. Expected outcome of the relaxation and simplification measures introduced under the new Act is largely dependent on the successful implementation of such measures by ADs/RDs and their ability to deal effectively and efficiently with the stakeholders.

In addition, the new framework may require continuous revisions centered on the feedback received from stakeholders based on the industry dynamics, as this is a new policy initiative.
