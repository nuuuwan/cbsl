3.1 OverviewR

ecognising the importance of developing

both economic and social infrastructure

to enhance the country’s competitiveness

and accelerate sustainable economic growth,

the government continued with its infrastructure

development work amid a tight fiscal space. In

terms of economic infrastructure, development

activities such as the construction of expressways,

highways and regional roads, urban and housing

development projects, irrigation, port and airport

development activities and commissioning of power

projects were in progress during 2017. Meanwhile,

the economy benefitted from the improvement in

communication and logistical support activities. In

this respect, telecommunication and port sector

activities continued their growth momentum

supported by the private sector involvement.

The Colombo Port City Project, which is a

public-private partnership towards developing a

world-class city in South Asia, along with a financial

hub, rapidly progressed during 2017 in terms of land

reclamation and breakwater construction. Airport

development activities, including the resurfacing

of the runway at Bandaranaike International

Airport, were carried out during the year. Moreover,

several urban development programmes were

initiated by the government, with the support

of the private sector. Further, the government

and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority entered into a

concession agreement with a Chinese company to

further develop the Hambantota port with the aim of

developing the country as a maritime hub. Given the

fiscal constraints, the government needs to further

encourage private sector participation in economic

infrastructure development, especially for the efficient

operation of transportation, telecommunication and

port services, while ensuring the quality of such

infrastructure and healthy competition among private

sector participants.

Meanwhile, global and domestic developments

posed challenges to the provisioning of consumer

utilities, particularly in the energy sector. Rising

global oil prices eroded the profitability of the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC), while financial losses

of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) widened due

to increased reliance on thermal power generation

owing to drought conditions. These state-owned

business enterprises (SOBEs) have periodically

faced similar adverse situations in the past, seriously

challenging the financial viability of these entities.

energy sector highlights the importance of adopting

cost-reflective pricing strategies, particularly for

petroleum and electricity. During the year under

review, the government strengthened the drive

towards sustainable energy projects, but it is crucial

to expedite the expansion and diversification of

energy generation to ensure energy security while

minimising energy generation costs.

Although Sri Lanka has been successful in

achieving human development goals to a great

extent, government policies should focus on

addressing the changing demands of the economy

that arise due to social and demographic dynamics.

During the year under review, the government

continued to spend on health and education

services, with the aim of improving the quality and

equitable access to such services. However, the

country’s health sector policies need to be focussed

to address the issues stemming from an ageing

population and changing disease patterns. During

2017, the government continued with the ‘13 years

of guaranteed education’ and ‘nearest school is the

best school’ concepts, with the objective of providing

students equitable access to quality education

services while meeting the skill requirements of the

labour market and student aspirations. However, the

private sector involvement in health and education

sectors is vital as state sector institutions alone

cannot meet the demand for these services that

is growing with the gradually rising population and

income levels as well as the demands arising from

the labour market in the context of an increasingly

complex economy. Hence, the government should

facilitate private sector engagement in health

and education services while strengthening the

regulatory environment to ensure that private sector

services provide value-for-money. A well-educated

and healthy nation, not only supports high economic

growth, but also helps the reduction of the incidence

of poverty in the country. The overall poverty

level in Sri Lanka has decreased considerably,

but income disparity, existence of severe poverty

pockets and a considerable fraction of economically

vulnerable groups living just above the poverty

line remain as social issues. Hence, social

safety-nets and poverty reduction programmes

need to be strengthened further by targeting

under-privileged groups in the society, with the aim

of uplifting their livelihoods while promoting inclusive

economic growth. In designing these programmes,

the focus should be on cash transfers rather than

generalised subsidies which are often more costly

and distort resource allocation, thereby reducing the

growth and employment generation potential of the

economy. Further, environmental aspects should be

an integral part of the development policy framework

of Sri Lanka with a view to minimising the impact of

natural catastrophes and limiting the occurrence of

man-made disasters.

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Petroleum

During 2017, annual average global crude oil

(Brent) prices rose above the levels observed

in 2016. Crude oil prices witnessed a declining

trend at the beginning of the year up to mid-June

2017 despite the decision taken in December

2016 by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting

Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC oil producing

countries to curb oil production. Higher US oil

production resulted in a supply glut in the world

market that contributed towards the fall in crude oil

prices. Consequently, the monthly average Brent

price declined from US dollars 55.67 per barrel

in January 2017 to US dollars 47.71 per barrel

by June 2017. In May 2017, OPEC and a few

non-OPEC oil producing countries, such as Russia

and Venezuela, extended their production cut until

March 2018. This decision, coupled with a slowdown

in US drilling activities and stronger global oil

demand forecasts, led to a reversal in the declining

trend in prices. Although crude oil prices declined

temporarily in end-August 2017 due to adverse

weather conditions hampering the demand for crude

oil from refineries in some parts of the US, prices

rebounded with the gradual recommencement of

refineries in these areas. Rising oil prices were

further spurred by the decision taken by OPEC

and several non-OPEC oil producing countries, on

30 November 2017, to extend the production cut

until the end of 2018. This latest agreement allows

oil producers to exit early from the deal in the event

of the market getting overheated. The upward

trend in prices continued in the month of December

as well, due to the extended production cut deal,

weaker dollar, higher demand driven by the cold

winter in the Northern hemisphere and upward

revision of global growth forecasts for 2018 by the

International Monetary Fund (IMF). Accordingly,

the monthly average Brent price rose to

US dollars 63.92 per barrel by December 2017,

recording a 16.8 per cent increase in comparison

to December 2016. However, the rise in oil prices

was limited to some extent by increased US oil

production, which raised the US production to

be on par with Saudi Arabia. In early December

2017, US crude oil production increased by 25,000

barrels per day (bpd) to 9.7 million bpd, which is the

highest level recorded since early 1970s when the

US production exceeded 10 million bpd. As a result

of the overall oil market dynamics, the average price

of Brent was US dollars 54.76 per barrel in 2017,

which was an increase of 21.6 per cent compared

to the average observed in the previous year.

Overall, movements of the average price

of crude oil imported by the CPC were in line

with global oil prices. Accordingly, the average

price of crude oil imported by the CPC increased

by 24.8 per cent to US dollars 57.79 per barrel

in 2017 from the annual average import price of

US dollars 46.30 per barrel in the previous year. At

the same time, the average import price of refined

petroleum products also recorded a 15.7 per cent

increase from US dollars 434.62 per MT in 2016 to

US dollars 503.06 per MT in 2017.

Despite the rising trend in global oil prices,

domestic petrol and diesel prices remained

unchanged in 2016 and 2017 since the last

downward price adjustments effected in 2015.

However, with effect from 09 January 2017, the

retail price of kerosene was reduced by Rs. 5 per

litre to Rs. 44 per litre, with a view to transferring

the benefit of lower global oil prices that prevailed

at the beginning of 2017 to consumers. Although

domestic petrol and diesel prices were maintained

unchanged, the government waived off a part of

customs duties applied on petrol and diesel thrice

during the year to ease the financial burden on

the CPC from rising global oil prices. Accordingly,

the customs duties on petrol and diesel were

waived off by Rs. 10 per litre and Rs. 3 per litre,

respectively, in each instance on 01 February 2017

and 15 December 2017. Moreover, the customs

duties on petrol and diesel were further reduced by

Rs.3 per litre and Rs.5 per litre, respectively, on

22 December 2017.

During 2017, petroleum product sales in

the domestic market were primarily driven

by the demand for energy generation and

transportation. The drought conditions during most

of 2017, together with the regular disruptions to the

operations at the Norochcholai coal power plant,

led to increased fuel-oil based power generation.

As a result, petroleum sales for energy generation,

which accounted for a 20 per cent share of total

petroleum sales, grew by 20.7 per cent in 2017.

Meanwhile, petroleum sales to the transportation

sector, which contributed to 61.4 per cent of total

petroleum sales in the domestic market, grew

by 4.9 per cent during the period under review.

Further, petroleum sales to the aviation sector,

which accounted for 8.8 per cent of total petroleum

sales, grew by 7.4 per cent during the year. Growth

in diesel and furnace oil sales in 2017 was mainly

driven by the demand from the energy sector,

whereas the transportation sector demand was

the key contributor to the increased sales of petrol.

Growth in kerosene sales was mainly spurred by

the household sector.

Non-adjustment of domestic market prices

in response to elevated petroleum prices

in the global market weakened the financial

performance of the CPC during 2017, in

comparison to the preceding year, in spite of

adjustments made to customs duties. According

to the provisional unaudited financial statements,

the CPC has reported a profit of Rs. 5.1 billion

before taxes in 2017, in comparison to Rs.69.6

billion in 2016. Profits from the sale of petroleum

products to the energy generation sector and

interest on CPC’s bank deposits mainly contributed

to the profit in 2017. Despite the reduced profits,

the gross liabilities of the CPC to the banking sector

declined by 8.1 per cent to Rs. 177.1 billion by end

2017, from Rs. 192.6 billion at the end of the previous

year. On the other hand, local currency deposits of

the CPC with the state banks recorded a decline

to Rs. 5 billion by end 2017, from Rs. 32.8 billion

as at end 2016, as these deposits were converted

to repay foreign currency loans to the banking

sector. Meanwhile, outstanding trade receivables of

the CPC from government entities increased from

Rs. 31.1 billion at the end of 2016 to Rs. 74.1 billion

by end 2017. The CEB and SriLankan Airlines

(SLA) accounted for 67.9 per cent and 17.4 per cent,

respectively, of the total trade receivables of the CPC.

Rising oil prices in global markets and

inefficiencies in administered prices warrant

the implementation of a market-based pricing

formula for petroleum products in the domestic

market. During an upswing in global oil prices,

administered prices that are not adjusted to reflect

the actual cost of petroleum products lead to a

deterioration of the financial performance of the

CPC while creating macroeconomic imbalances,

particularly through the severe burden on the

government budget and heavy borrowings by

the CPC from state banks. Further, when the

administered prices are not cost reflective,

domestic consumer demand does not adjust

with the changing global prices, leading to an

increase in the petroleum import bill. Similarly,

consumers may not benefit from lower petroleum

prices when the international oil prices are on

a declining trend, under the current non-cost

reflective pricing mechanism. Meanwhile, providing

blanket subsidies for certain petroleum products is

also inefficient since the subsidy is not targeting

low-income earners. Therefore, it is of high priority

to implement a market-based pricing strategy and

an effective subsidy targeting mechanism to ensure

the financial viability of the CPC and to reduce the

fiscal burden.

The activities of the Petroleum Resources

Development Secretariat (PRDS) for 2017 and

beyond mainly focus on data acquisition and

exploration, natural gas commercialisation,

policy formulation and strengthening the

legal framework for off-shore exploration. In

early February 2017, the government called for

Expressions of Interest from international gas and

oil companies for the development of natural gas

deposits, which have been discovered in Block M2

of the Mannar basin, and the production of gas.

A mini bid round is planned to be announced in

the first half of 2018 to select a suitable investor

to explore the gas discoveries at Block M2. It is

planned to utilise the natural gas produced at

this site for electricity generation in the natural

gas-powered plants proposed under the least cost

power generation plan of the CEB. Meanwhile,

a survey is scheduled to commence in 2018 as

a joint study with an oil exploration company to

acquire a 5,000 line-km of seismic data in the

Eastern coast. Moreover, the PRDS is in the final

phase of negotiations with a subsidiary of a global

off-shore oil-field service providing company for an

agreement to carry out an Umbrella Multi-Client

Survey to enhance the off-shore exploration data

repository capacity of the country.

Electricity

Electricity generation continued to expand

with a higher dependence on thermal power

generation during 2017. Total electricity generation

increased by 3.7 per cent to 14,671 GWh in 2017,

from 14,149 GWh in the preceding year. The

drought conditions that prevailed since the latter

part of 2016 continued during the first nine months

of 2017, significantly hampering hydropower

generation and increasing the country’s reliance

on thermal power generation. Consequently,

hydropower generation, excluding mini hydro

generation, registered a decline of 12.1 per cent

to 3,059 GWh, whereas fuel oil-based power

generation and coal power generation increased

by 13.1 per cent and 1.1 per cent, to 5,045 GWh

and 5,103 GWh, respectively. With the rise in

mini hydropower generation due to the rainfall

received during the latter part of 2017, electricity

generation through non-conventional renewable

energy (NCRE) sources increased by 26.3 per cent

to 1,464 GWh in 2017, compared to the previous

year. Accordingly, coal based electricity generation

accounted for the largest share within the total

generation followed by fuel oil, hydro and NCRE

power generation, respectively, during 2017. This

was despite the disruptions experienced in coal

power generation from time to time in 2017 due to

the breakdown of some units of the Norochcholai

coal power plant and scheduled maintenance

activities. Meanwhile, the power plants owned

by the CEB contributed 72.9 per cent to the total

power generation in 2017, while the remainder was

purchased from the independent power producers

(IPPs). The overall transmission and distribution loss

as a percentage of total power generation continued

to decline during the year due to measures taken to

mitigate such losses through improved distribution

efficiency. Meanwhile, electricity sales grew by

5 per cent during the year. The increase in

electricity sales was mainly driven by the industry,

general-purpose and domestic sectors, which

accounted for 30.1 per cent, 20.7 per cent and

32.7 per cent shares, respectively, of total electricity

sales in 2017. According to the provisional data of

the CEB, the level of electrification of the country

stood at 99.3 per cent by end 2016.

The CEB recorded a significant financial

loss during 2017 amidst lower hydropower

generation and increased reliance on fuel

oil-based power generation. Drought conditions

coupled with the intermittent disruptions to the coal

power generation resulted in high fuel oil-based

power generation during 2017. The average cost of

hydro, coal and fuel oil-based power generation by

the CEB was Rs. 2.77, Rs. 9.74 and Rs. 25.72 per

kWh, respectively. Meanwhile, the average cost of

electricity purchased by the CEB from IPPs was

Rs. 23.72 per kWh. Therefore, the CEB’s average

cost of electricity at selling point amounted to

Rs. 20.06 per kWh although the average tariff was

only Rs. 16.49 per kWh. The average tariffs per

kWh charged by the CEB from industry, domestic,

general-purpose, government and hotel sectors

were Rs. 14.74, Rs. 13.49, Rs. 23.78, Rs. 17.95,

and Rs. 17.62, respectively. Consequently, the

overall loss margin of the CEB at selling point

was Rs. 3.57 per kWh. According to the unaudited

provisional financial statements, the financial

performance of the CEB had further worsened with

losses before tax increasing from Rs. 13.2 billion

in 2016 to Rs. 45.7 billion in 2017. Moreover, the

combined short-term liabilities of the CEB to the

banking sector, CPC and IPPs increased from

Rs. 91.5 billion at end 2016 to Rs. 138 billion by

end 2017. Outstanding long-term liabilities of

the CEB, primarily to the banking sector and the

government, also increased to Rs. 319.6 billion by

end 2017, recording an increase of Rs. 19.9 billion

in comparison to the end of the preceding year.

During 2017, the Public Utilities Commission

of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) approved the Least

Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan

(LCLTGEP) for the CEB for the next 20-year

period with the aim of ensuring energy security

while considering both financial and economic

costs of energy generation. As per the approved

LCLTGEP, 242 MW of major hydro, 215 MW

of mini hydro, 1,389 MW of solar, 1,205 MW of

wind, 85 MW of biomass, 4,800 MW of liquefied

natural gas (LNG), 320 MW of furnace oil and

105 MW of gas turbine-based power plants will

be added to the installed capacity of the country

during the 2018 - 2037 period. It is crucial to

execute the proposed generation plan in a timely

and effective manner in order to meet the growing

energy demand at the lowest economic cost to the

economy. The generation plan approved by the

PUCSL consists of 4,800 MW of natural gas-based

power plants, although Sri Lanka does not have a

natural gas supply at present. Hence, it is essential

to expeditiously develop a reliable source of LNG

supply to the country for the timely commissioning

of LNG-based power generation. Failure to do so

will compel the LNG power plants to operate on

fuel oil, significantly increasing the generation cost

of the CEB. In addition, the failure to achieve the

milestones of LCLTGEP would result in the CEB

having to resort to emergency power purchasing

agreements with the high-cost independent thermal

power producers. The share of thermal IPPs in

total energy generation is already at a considerably

high level, which was 17.1 per cent in 2017. The

2017 forecasts that the implementation delays in the

power generation expansion schedule that is given

in the LCLTGEP for 2018 to 2020 period will cost

the CEB approximately Rs. 50.62 billion. Hence, the

timely implementation of the generation expansion

plan is vital to ensure energy security as well as the

financial viability of the CEB. Meanwhile, the CEB

has proposed to develop two 300 MW coal power

plants by 2025, which are not in the LCLTGEP plant

schedule approved by the PUCSL, with the aim of

minimising the financial cost of power generation

in the country. The government is currently in the

process of evaluating this proposal to decide on the

most appropriate technology for coal power plants

in the country. Moreover, the Ministry of Power and

Renewable Energy submitted a revised version of

the new National Energy Policy and Strategies to

the Cabinet of Ministers for approval. The preferred

fuel options for power generation recommended

therein are hydro, fuel-oil, coal, LNG, solar, wind

and biomass. It is important to determine the

optimal mix of energy sources for Sri Lanka in

terms of both financial and economic costs, and

thereby the long-term generation expansion plan

for the country, without considering power projects

in an ad-hoc manner.

Numerous generation expansion projects

were in progress during 2017 with particular

emphasis on enhancing the installed thermal

power generation capacity. Bids are currently

being evaluated to develop a 300 MW natural

gas-fired combined cycle power plant in

Kerawalapitiya on Build, Own, Operate and

Transfer (BOOT) basis. In addition, the bidding

process commenced for the construction of a 100

MW furnace oil-fired, barge-based power plant in

Galle and four 24 MW furnace oil-fired power plants

that are planned to be commissioned in 2018, and

three 35 MW gas turbine power plants that are

scheduled to be added to the national grid by 2020.

The government continued to increase the

capacity of renewable energy generation in the

country, with a view to enhancing sustainability

in the energy sector. The construction of Uma Oya,

Moragahakanda and Broadlands hydropower plants

was in progress during 2017 and these projects are

expected to add 120 MW, 25 MW and 35MW to

the national grid by mid-2018, 2018 and mid-2019,

respectively. Meanwhile, bids are being evaluated

to construct a 100 MW wind park in the Mannar

island. The 'Soorya Bala Sangramaya' programme,

which was launched in 2016 in collaboration with

the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, the

Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA),

the CEB and the Lanka Electricity Company

(Private) Limited (LECO), continued during 2017.

To this end, the ‘Rivi Bala Savi’ loan scheme was

introduced in 2017 to provide concessionary loans

to households through the banking sector to setup

rooftop solar power PV panels. The government

allocated Rs. 1,500 million as subsidy payments to

the banks in order to implement this loan scheme

during 2017. Meanwhile, 4,275 consumers joined

the Net Metering, Net Accounting and Net Plus

plans as rooftop energy generators by adding

35 MW to the national grid during this year. Further,

as per the Budget 2017, a project has been initiated

to convert public sector buildings to solar rooftop

power producers with a budgetary allocation of

Rs. 350 million. Under this project, 10kW and

20kW solar rooftop systems were provided free

for 13 schools, 77 hospitals and four government

institutions. In addition, the ‘Rivi Aruna’ project

commenced in 2017 to convert religious premises

to rooftop solar power projects by providing solar

panels free to selected religious places. Accordingly,

135 solar systems have been installed in religious

places, adding 270 kW to the system. The

excess electricity generated by these projects are

purchased by the CEB either through Net Metering

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

91

or Net Accounting plans. Although promoting such

green energy projects is a commendable step

towards increasing renewable energy generation,

the government needs to formulate a cost recovery

process to reduce the fiscal burden.

During 2017, several measures were

implemented in the energy sector to introduce

energy-related standards and regulations,

and improve energy efficiency and demand

management. In this regard, the SLSEA published

the standards on energy labelling for CFL bulbs

during 2017 and is currently in the process

of developing standards for air-conditioners,

refrigerators and computers. Meanwhile, the

SLSEA provided consultancy and audit services

related to energy conservation and demand

management for government institutions while

issuing accreditations for energy management

officers and energy auditors in both private and

public sectors. Moreover, the PUCSL approved an

optional, time-based tariff scheme for single-phase

domestic consumers, which was earlier limited

only to the consumers who have three-phase and

consuming 30A or above. With the time-based tariff

scheme, the consumers have the option to pay a

lower rate for the electricity used during off-peak

hours, which in turn would lead to more efficient

management of the demand for electricity and

thereby lower their electricity bills. In 2016, the

PUCSL introduced the national standard for plug

and socket outlets in Sri Lanka for non-industrial

applications to ensure the safety of electricity users.

Accordingly, the manufacture and importation

of non-standard plugs, socket outlets, adaptors

and extension cords with universal sockets were

banned from August 2017, while the sale of such

non-standard items will be prohibited from August

2018.

Road Development

Amidst tight fiscal conditions, the

government continued to improve the road

network of the country for better regional

integration and improved productivity,

supporting economic growth. Sri Lanka’s road

network consisted of 12,210 km of Class A and

Class B roads, 169.8 km of expressways and 4,662

bridges as at end 2017. The total expenditure

incurred by the Road Development Authority

(RDA) on roads and bridges increased by 45.8 per

cent to Rs. 166.5 billion in 2017 in comparison to

2016. This included expenditure on expressway

development, highway development, construction

of flyovers and bridges and expenditure on

widening and improving of roads.

Extensions to the national expressway

network continued during 2017. The extension

of the Southern Expressway from Matara to

Hambantota, including the expressway link

to Mattala, progressed during 2017. This 96

km-long extension to the expressway is expected

to be completed by October 2019. Meanwhile,

initial work of the Central Expressway extending

from Kadawatha to Dambulla, with its Meerigama-

Ambepussa and Pothuhera-Galagedara links,

continued during 2017. This project consists of four

sections, and currently land acquisition for section I

from Kadawatha to Meerigama, land improvement

for section II from Meerigama to Kurunegala and

feasibility studies for section III from Pothuhera to

Galagedara are in progress. Land acquisition and

civil work related to the construction of Phase III of

the Outer Circular Highway (OCH), which connects

the Kadawatha and Kerawalapitiya interchanges

with a link to the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway,

also continued during 2017. This project has a road

length of 9.6 km, involving an estimated cost of

Rs. 77.7 billion, of which the civil work is funded

through financial assistance from the EXIM Bank

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

of China. The revenue generated by the three

expressways currently in operation increased

by 11.2 per cent to Rs. 7.9 billion with the rise in

vehicular traffic during the year. Increased usage of

expressways indicates the need for the development

of an efficient road infrastructure network that will

enhance the productivity of the economy.

The construction and development of

various roads, bridges and flyovers were

carried out during 2017. The Colombo National

Highways Project commenced three new

rehabilitation and improvement projects, namely,

Kottawa–Thalagala road, Kotte–Bope road and

Orugodawatta-Ambatale road during the year.

Under the Western Province Road Development

Project, work related to the rehabilitation and

improvement of the Wadduwa-Morontuduwa road

and Bellana–Moragala road commenced in 2017.

The Badulla-Chenkaladi road improvement project

continued with the commencement of civil work

on the Badulla-Bibile road. The Integrated Road

Investment Programme (i-Road) continued with a

loan facility provided by the Asian Development

Bank (ADB), and the rehabilitation of 3,130 km

of rural roads was in progress under this project

as at end 2017. At the same time, 285 km of

national roads are expected to be rehabilitated

and maintained over a period of seven years

under the i-Road Programme. Under the Northern

Road Connectivity Project funded by an ADB loan,

rehabilitation and improvement of the Kandy-Jaffna

road commenced in 2017. Concurrently, under

the "Maga Neguma" programme, a road length of

164.3 km was rehabilitated during 2017. Under the

Climate Resilience Improvement Project, which is

funded by a World Bank loan, a total of three bridges

are to be reconstructed during 2018 to mitigate flood

risk from heavy rains. Meanwhile, Phase 1 of the

Priority Roads Project-3 was in progress, for which

the China Development Bank (CDB) provided a

credit facility, and nearly 150.6 km road length of six

highways were completed during 2017. Preliminary

work in relation to the construction of a new bridge

over the Kelani river, which would consist of six

traffic lanes, at an estimated cost of Rs. 55,313

million, continued during the period. Meanwhile, the

construction work of the Polgahawela, Ganemulla

and Rajagiriya flyovers was completed during 2017

and the flyovers were operational by January 2018.

Several measures were undertaken to reduce

traffic congestion and improve road safety in

major cities. A project initiated with the technical

assistance from the government of the Republic of

Korea for developing a Centralised Traffic Control

System with advanced traffic management features

in the Colombo metropolitan region progressed

during 2017. Under this project, detailed designs

for 133 junction improvements were completed

during the year.

The RDA has planned several other medium-

term and long-term road development projects.

The Ruwanpura expressway has been proposed

to connect Ratnapura to the Southern expressway

with a length of 74 km and six interchanges. The

majority of the feasibility and environmental impact

assessment studies for this project are being

finalised. Initial work on the Port Access Elevated

Highway project that will connect the OCH with the

new Kelani bridge was in progress. Accordingly,

the feasibility study for Phase 1 from the new

Kelani bridge to Rajagiriya was completed and the

environmental impact assessment was in progress.

Meanwhile, feasibility studies are in progress to

extend the Marine drive from Dehiwala to Panadura

and to extend the Baseline Road up to the Galle

Road at Ratmalana. Further, a feasibility study

has been carried out to construct an underground

tunnel connecting the Marine Drive in Colombo

to the elevated airport expressway through the

Colombo Port City to facilitate uncongested traffic

movement in the surrounding area.

Road Passenger Transportation

Bus passenger transportation witnessed

a subdued performance as reflected through

the developments in both public and private

sector bus operations during 2017. The total

operated kilometres of the Sri Lanka Transport

Board (SLTB) decreased marginally by 0.8 per cent

to 448.1 million km while passenger kilometres

also decreased by 1.8 percent to 15.8 billion km

in 2017, in comparison to 16.1 billion km in 2016.

During 2017, operated kilometres of private buses

decreased by 2.1 per cent to 1 billion km and

passenger kilometres also declined by 2.4 per cent

to 50.8 billion km, in comparison to the previous

year. The reduction in terms of bus operations for

both public and private operators was mainly due

to the impact of floods in many parts of the island

during May 2017. The total number of buses owned

and the average bus fleet operated by the SLTB

decreased by 6.3 per cent and 0.9 per cent to 7,305

and 5,266 in 2017, respectively, in comparison

to the previous year. In the year under review,

283 buses were rehabilitated through the funds

provided by the Ministry of Transport and Civil

Aviation. In the meantime, the number of buses

owned by private operators increased by 2 per

cent to 19,998 in 2017, while the average bus fleet

operated decreased by 0.9 per cent to 16,976 in

2017. However, major improvements to both public

and private bus transport services are essential

to overcome the exacerbating issue of traffic

congestion in urban areas, and thereby reducing

productivity losses in the overall economy due to

road traffic. In this regard, increasing the frequency

of bus operations to reduce over-crowding of

buses, establishing integrated bus schedules and

easy multi-modal payment methods in all regions,

and enhancing inter-modal connectedness through

transport hubs linking bus and rail transport systems

etc. are necessary steps towards improving bus

transport services. During 2017, the government

implemented priority bus lanes in selected roads

within the Colombo city, although this policy is not

being implemented effectively at present.

The financial performance of the SLTB

showed marginal improvement during 2017.

Despite the upward revision to bus fares of both

the public and private sector, by 6.3 per cent on

01 July 2017, the total revenue of the SLTB

improved by only 3 per cent during 2017 to

Rs. 42.2 billion as indicated by the provisional

unaudited financial statements. However, as

operating expenditure decreased by 4.6 per cent to

Rs. 40.1 billion, the financial performance in 2017

resulted in an operational profit of Rs. 2.1 billion, as

against the loss of Rs. 1.1 billion recorded in 2016.

The National Transport Commission (NTC)

continued to take measures to improve the

efficiency and coverage of road passenger

transportation in 2017. The NTC is engaged

in a project to implement a ‘Unified Transport

Card Solution (UTCS)’, with multiple top-up and

touch-out capabilities with the intention of providing

a convenient transport payment card facility

that can be used for multiple transport modes to

minimise inconveniences faced by passengers and

service providers. Meanwhile, 55 buses have been

in operation under the project for strengthening the

SLTB and railway coordinated services, connecting

railway stations and principal locations within the

Colombo city. During 2017, an equal number of

buses were deployed by the SLTB and the private

sector to operate on the Southern Expressway and

Outer Circular Highway connecting Kadawatha and

Matara under a coordinated time table. Measures

were taken by the SLTB to improve the bus fleet

through installation of new engines and renovation

of used engines during the year. Meanwhile, the

budget allocation by the government for the ‘Sisu

Seriya’ bus service, which caters to school children,

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

94

amounted to Rs. 562 million in 2017. Ninety new

‘Sisu Seriya’ services have been launched during

the year and there were 1,389 buses operating

under the programme. The ‘Nisi Seriya’ bus service

continued to facilitate night time passengers by

providing a secure public transport service. Under

this project, 35 new buses were deployed in 2017.

Meanwhile, Rs. 10 million has been assigned to the

‘Gemi Seriya’ programme that caters to the rural

areas and the NTC has received relevant approvals

to initiate 11 new services under this project.

The registration of new motor vehicles

decreased during 2017. The number of new

vehicle registrations during 2017 decreased by

8.4 per cent to 451,653, following a decline of

26.2 per cent in the previous year. The decline was

mainly witnessed in three wheelers, dual-purpose

vehicles and motor cars, while the registration of

buses and goods transport vehicles increased during

the year. The reduction in motor vehicle registration

during the year could be attributed to the reduction

in Loan to Value (LTV) ratios for selected vehicles

with the aim of reducing motor vehicle imports to the

country. Further, the tax revisions on the import of

motor vehicles and the marginal depreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar also

contributed to such a decline in the registration of

new vehicles.

Rail Transportation

Rail transportation recorded a modest

growth in both passenger and goods

transportation activities in 2017. Rail passenger

kilometrage increased by 1.1 per cent to 7.5 billion

km in 2017 from 7.4 billion km recorded in 2016.

Further, the goods kilometrage increased by

3.5 per cent to 144.8 million MT km in 2017.

The overall increase in passenger and goods

kilometrage was supported by the increase in

available rolling stock of the Sri Lanka Railways

(SLR) by 7 per cent to 1,676 in 2017, in

comparison to 1,567 in 2016.

The SLR continued to engage in

the construction of railway tracks, and

improvement and rehabilitation work to

provide continuous passenger and freight

transportation services. The upgrading of the

Kelani Valley Railway line, according to a special

budget proposal in 2016, was completed in 2017.

Meanwhile, the procurement process of rolling

stock under an Indian line of credit is in progress

and advance payments have been made during

2017. Further, the SLR has rehabilitated 18

passenger carriages, four locomotives and one

power set. The completion of double tracking

of the railway line from Kalutara South to

Payagala South and Seeduwa to Katunayaka,

and commencement of double tracking of the

railway line from Kandy to Kadugannawa took

place during 2017. Meanwhile, 30 new protected

level crossing systems were established and 100

level crossing systems were repaired in 2017.

Further, the SLR, with the assistance of the ADB,

is in the process of preparing a railway master

plan in order to expand and improve the railway

infrastructure and services.

As per the provisional financial statements,

the SLR recorded an operating loss of

Rs. 7.6 billion in 2017, compared to a loss of

Rs. 6.8 billion in 2016. During 2017, the total

revenue of the SLR decreased by 2.2 per cent

to Rs. 6.5 billion, in comparison to the previous

year, mainly due to the two unanticipated

railway strikes carried out by the SLR workers,

hampering normal operational activities. Further,

operating expenditure of the SLR increased by

5.1 per cent in 2017 to Rs. 14.1 billion, from

Rs. 13.4 billion recorded in 2016. However,

the total expenditure of the SLR decreased by

7.3 per cent to Rs. 27 billion in 2017 in comparison

to 2016, supported by the decline in capital

expenditure with the completion of the Northern

railway line reconstruction project.

The rail transportation system in

Sri Lanka has tremendous potential to enhance

the interconnectedness between different

regions economically and efficiently, while

reducing emissions, energy consumption as

well as productivity losses due to road traffic

congestion. However, the lack of timely investment

in fleet replacement and lack of technology usage

by the SLR have resulted in over-crowding of trains

and delays, reducing the reliability of the railway

transport system. Further, frequent trade union

actions which disrupt the smooth functioning of

the service, and low passenger fares and goods

transport tariffs worsen the financial viability of the

SLR, and thereby reduce the available funds for

future investment. Therefore, the SLR needs to

focus on investing the available limited funds on

rolling stock as well as on technology for general

operations and management, and to improve

customer services, such as the provision of online

booking, paperless ticketing and easy payment

systems. Further, the SLR needs to partner with

the private sector to expand its freight market share

and offer ancillary services such as courier services

in order to generate additional revenue. Investment

in workforce development through training,

instilling a commercial mindset among the staff and

improving accountability and transparency of the

institution are essential to unleash the full potential

of the SLR as an efficient transport mode that is

complementary to road transportation.

Civil Aviation

The country’s civil aviation sector registered

overall positive growth in terms of passenger

and cargo handling during 2017. Passenger

movements at the Bandaranaike International

Airport (BIA) grew by 5 per cent to 9.8 million,

compared to 9.3 million in 2016. Further, the

total cargo handling at the BIA increased by

4.7 per cent to 265,786 MT in 2017 in comparison

to the previous year. However, the number of

aircraft movements at the BIA increased only

marginally by 0.3 per cent to 64,903 during 2017,

due to the closure of the runway for 8 hours per day

for the runway overlay project from 6 January 2017

to 6 April 2017. Resultantly, aircraft movements

at the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport

(MRIA) increased by 6.9 per cent to 978 in 2017,

in comparison to 915 in 2016. Further, passenger

handling, inclusive of transit passengers of the

MRIA, increased to 30,051 passengers in 2017

from 5,750 passengers in 2016. Meanwhile, 31

airlines were operating international flights to and

from Sri Lanka during the year. Domestic passenger

movements, which are catered by six local airline

companies, decreased by 20 per cent to 24,597, in

comparison to 30,741 in 2016. The decline in the

demand for domestic air travel during the year was

due to the absence of scheduled airline services

at reasonable price levels covering the island wide

domestic route network.

SLA continued its weak financial

performance, recording an operational loss of

Rs. 13.7 billion in 2017 in comparison to a loss

of Rs. 10.4 billion in 2016. Although, revenue

increased by 12.3 per cent to Rs. 148 billion,

operating expenditure grew by 13.7 per cent to

Rs. 161.7 billion, resulting in continued losses of

SLA. The loss incurred by SLA was mainly due to

poor load factor on some uneconomical routes.

Hence, SLA plans to increase frequencies to

New Delhi, Hyderabad and Lahore while reducing

frequencies to Seychelles, Male and Gan Islands

and discontinuing the flight to Kunming, China in

2018. Further, the airline took another decisive

step in extending its route network with the

launch of the daily direct flights to Melbourne from

29 October 2017. Meanwhile, the fleet composition

of SLA included 13 wide body and 14 narrow body

aircraft by the end of 2017, which is the largest fleet

to date in the history of the airline. Further, the total

seat capacity operated by SLA showed a 7 per cent

increase in 2017. Meanwhile, in order to improve

the financial viability of SLA, the government called

for Requests for Proposal (RFP) in 2017, for the

provision of consultancy services. A lead consultant

was appointed to assist the restructuring process by

conducting an independent assessment of SLA’s

current business model and providing assistance

in identifying potential candidates for the proposed

Public Private Partnership (PPP).

Construction work of several aviation

development projects progressed during 2017.

During the year, the single runway of the BIA

was re-laid at a cost of Rs. 7.2 billion, fulfilling a

long-felt need. This newly resurfaced runway is

able to accommodate the landing of large aircraft

such as the A380. The Automatic Dependence

Surveillance-B project was completed at a cost of

Rs. 200 million during the second quarter of 2017

to increase air safety and surveillance coverage

within the Colombo Flight Information Region

(FIR). Further, restructuring and remodelling of

the existing passenger terminal building was also

carried out at the BIA. Most of the refurbishment

activities were in progress by the end of 2017,

while the renovation of the departure walkway

was completed in October 2017. Further, Airport

and Aviation Services Sri Lanka Limited (AASL)

is planning to build two airport hotels in proximity

Port Services

Port sector activities continued to improve

in 2017 due to increased commercial operations

at the Colombo International Container

Terminal (CICT) and South Asia Gateway

Terminal (SAGT), amidst the slowdown in

activity at terminals owned by the Sri Lanka

Ports Authority (SLPA). Total container handling

at the Colombo port, which stood at 5.7 million

twenty-foot equivalent container units (TEUs) in

2016, grew by 8.3 per cent to 6.2 million TEUs in

2017. Compared to 2016, container handling at

the CICT and SAGT increased by 19.3 per cent

and 10.9 per cent, respectively, in 2017. However,

the terminals owned by the SLPA recorded

a negative growth of 4.3 per cent in terms of

container handling during 2017 in comparison to

2016. Overall transshipment container handling

registered a growth of 8.8 per cent during 2017, with

the expansion in global merchandise trade activities.

Meanwhile, total cargo handling also increased to

93.9 million MT in 2017, which is an 8.5 per cent growth

in comparison to 2016, supported by the performance

of the SAGT and CICT. However, cargo handling

at the SLPA terminals in Colombo declined for the

third consecutive year, recording a negative growth

of 0.5 per cent in 2017. This was mainly due to the

non-availability of container terminals with deeper

draught berths equipped with high profile ships-to-

shore cranes at the Jaye Container Terminal (JCT).

Hence, CICT at the Colombo South harbour attracted

ships and volumes from both JCT and SAGT.

Although port activities in Sri Lanka have steadily

grown due to the increase in the arrival of large ships,

overall ship arrivals recorded a decline of 2.4 per cent

in 2017.

Major development projects initiated

with the aim of enhancing productivity and

competitiveness of port activities at the

Colombo port as well as regional ports, such

as Galle, Kankesanthurai and Trincomalee,

continued during 2017. The SLPA is in the

process of building the East Container Terminal

(ECT) at the Colombo port with the assistance

of the ADB. It will be the second-deep draught

container terminal in the South Harbour with an

annual capacity of 2.4 million TEUs and a 1,200m

quay wall with 18m depth. Meanwhile, on 29 July

2017, the SLPA and the government entered into a

concession agreement with China Merchants Port

Holdings Company (CMPort) to improve operational

efficiency and future development activities of the

Hambantota port. This agreement is expected to

expand the revenue base, generate direct and

indirect employment, improve the efficiency of the

port management and its financial viability through

the adoption of a viable business model. Accordingly,

the CMPort has agreed to invest up to US dollars

1,120 million in port and marine related activities at

the Hambantota port. As per the agreement, port

operations at the Hambantota port will be carried

out by two companies which are jointly owned by

the CMPort and the SLPA, namely, Hambantota

International Port Group (Pvt) Ltd. (HIPG) and

Hambantota International Port Services Company

(Pvt) Ltd. (HIPS). The SLPA effectively owns

15 per cent and 50.7 per cent of the HIPG and

HIPS, respectively. The agreement is for a 99-year

period and the SLPA is entitled for royalty payments

for container and break-bulk handling activities

at the Hambantota port. Meanwhile, a novation

agreement was signed with a consultancy company

for the design works of Galle Port Development

Project – Phase I. During the initial phase, it is

planned to construct the breakwater with funds

borrowed from the Japan International Cooperation

Agency (JICA). Meanwhile, a multipurpose berth is

expected to be developed at the Galle port under a

Public Private Partnership (PPP) during the second

phase of the project. Further, the construction work

of the Trincomalee port continued with the aim of

developing a rail transportation system, improving

warehouse facilities and commencing night time

navigation at the port. The SLPA has also decided

to develop the Kankesanthurai port as a regional

port to serve the North and North Central Provinces.

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved to vest

15 acres of land to the SLPA for the development

activities at the Kankesanthurai port.

Despite the declining trend in container and

cargo handling at the SLPA owned terminals,

the financial performance of the SLPA improved

in 2017 mainly due to lower finance expenses.

The total revenue of the SLPA in 2017 increased

by 2.2 per cent to Rs. 44 billion, while the operating

expenditure decreased by 2.1 per cent to Rs. 28 billion

in comparison to the previous year. Consequently,

as per the unaudited provisional financial statement,

the SLPA reported a profit of Rs. 13.2 billion in 2017

before taxes, in comparison to the profit of Rs. 1 billion

before taxes recorded in 2016.

Communication Services

The telecommunication sector expanded

with a sustained increase in telephone and

internet connections during 2017. Reflecting

the continuous growth in the telecommunication

network of the country, mobile and fixed telephone

connections increased during the year. In line with

the growth in telephone connectivity, telephone

penetration (connections per 100 persons) also

increased to 143.6 by the end of the year due to

the high mobile penetration level, reflecting the

rising importance of mobile telecommunication

services in the country. Total internet connections

increased by 20 per cent in 2017 and this rapid

growth was mainly supported by an increase of

31.5 per cent in fixed internet connections, while

mobile internet connections also recorded a growth

of 17.3 per cent in 2017. However, the internet

penetration (connections per 100 persons) level of

the country stood at 27.5 by the end of the year.

Although internet penetration in Sri Lanka is low

in comparison to developed Asian countries, the

penetration, measured in terms of the number of

internet connections, tends to underestimate the

total penetration in the country, due to the usage

of one internet connection by multiple persons.

Meanwhile, the findings of the Household Income

and Expenditure Survey (HIES) – 2016 of the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS)

revealed that 8.5 per cent of households did not

have access to telephone facilities.

Government initiatives focused on

enhancing economic development through

increased access to telecommunication and

digital infrastructure. The Information and

Communication Technology Agency (ICTA)

was entrusted with digitalising the economy as

proposed in the national budget 2017, with an

allocation of Rs. 15 billion. Eight thematic areas

were identified under this digitalisation initiative,

focusing on various aspects related to a digital

ecosystem, including connectivity, security,

legislation and digital content. Digitalisation offers

more opportunities for economic growth and

facilitates to improve the quality of life and increase

access to public services. However, advances in

e-government initiatives must be in line with efforts

to bridge the digital divide. According to a

countrywide assessment carried out by ICTA

on information and communication technology

(ICT) access and usage in 2017, it was revealed

that the proportion of households with access to

internet services in the country is still at the low

level of 15.8 per cent, and only 25 per cent of

households possess at least one type of computer.

An integrated approach is required to address

social and economic factors that influence digital

inclusion in order to bridge the digital divide and

ensure most vulnerable groups benefit from ICT

and e-government initiatives.

During the year, the Telecommunications

Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL)

continued to regulate the telecommunication

industry with a focus on quality assurance in

the country. During 2017, the TRCSL continued

to impose the ‘Quality of Service’ parameters

and its relevant reporting requirements on

telecommunication service providers and offered

the ‘Internet Speed Test Tool’ facility for internet

users to test their internet speed. Further, the

‘Net Speed’ tool was also used by the TRCSL

to measure the internet speed of connections

of service providers based on a common

platform with test results made publicly available.

Meanwhile, the TRCSL, in collaboration with

the Department of Agriculture (DOA), Food and

Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and International

Telecommunication Union (ITU), conducted a

training programme on ‘Innovation and Application

Development for E-agriculture’ with the aim of

enhancing the capability within the DOA to make

innovations using emerging technologies to meet

development goals and challenges in the agriculture

sector. Further, the TRCSL conducted the Asia

Pacific Telecommunity Policy and Regulatory

Forum - 2017, which provided a platform to

discuss sub-regional policy and regulatory issues

in the telecommunication industry. Moreover, the

TRCSL conducted several training programmes

to improve ICT knowledge among teachers and

students of special schools, special education units

of vocational training centres and universities, with

the assistance of the ITU and National Information

Agency of Korea. Meanwhile, the Colombo Lotus

Tower project of the TRCSL, which would support

the hosting of television and radio broadcasting

while providing a telecommunication hub, is

expected to be completed by mid-2018.

ICTA engaged extensively in implementing

measures aimed at digitalising the economy

to transform Sri Lanka towards a knowledge

based economy. In 2017, 27 projects were initiated

and 13 projects were successfully completed,

with the aim of fully leveraging the potential

benefits of digitalisation. Through the successful

implementation of the Lanka Government Network

(LGN), 860 key government offices, including

Provincial Councils, Divisional Secretariats

and local authorities, were digitally connected.

Meanwhile, in order to make most government

services available online through a single portal

and to store government data in low cost common

servers, ICTA implemented the Lanka Government

Cloud (G-Cloud) and Lanka Gate eService

initiatives. Under the government digitalisation

programme, network infrastructure and secured

Wi-Fi network connectivity solutions were installed

at key government institutions. Further, ICTA

deployed the document and workflow management

system, namely, the Electronic Document

Attestation System (eDAS) at the Consular Division

of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which reduces

document attestation times and completely

eliminates fraudulent documents. The electronic

Medical Record System was implemented as a

pilot project in a few select Base Hospitals while the

installation of hardware was completed in a further

48 hospitals. Meanwhile, installation of network

facilities was completed in 46 hospitals through

LGN in 2017. With the aim of strengthening the

use of ICT in the classroom, several projects were

initiated by ICTA in collaboration with the Ministry

of Education during 2017.

The financial position of the Department of

Posts (DOP) remained subdued, highlighting

the need for continued effort towards

further diversifying its services in line with

global trends in postal communication.The

diversification of services of the DOP was mainly

carried out by introducing modern technological

developments available in communication

services through its network of post offices. The

postal network of the DOP included 653 main

post offices, 3,409 sub post offices, 523 agency

post offices, 101 rural agency post offices and

four estate agency post offices as of end 2017.

Through this network, the DOP provided speedy

and efficient postal services, financial services,

and social and obligatory services, increasing its

revenue by 6.4 per cent to Rs. 7 billion in 2017.

However, operating expenditure also increased by

2.6 per cent to Rs. 12.6 billion, resulting in an

operating loss of Rs. 5.6 billion during 2017, in

comparison to the Rs. 5.7 billion loss in 2016. The

continuous operating losses reported in the recent

past can be attributed to the enhanced performance

of alternative modes of communication, reduction

in revenue from foreign parcels and international

post, and increasing administrative costs. In order

to recover from losses and to increase revenue,

the DOP needs to formulate policies on costs and

the pricing structure while diversifying its products

and services further by incorporating technological

advancement and international best practices to

reduce costs and increase operational efficiency.

The high penetration of the post office network

within the country, which reaches remote areas

that are not covered by banks and other financial

institutions, could be used to provide multi-functional

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

101

services. The parcel delivery services of the DOP

need to be enhanced by upgrading the existing

delivery channels to be competitive with the current

online delivery operators. A major initiative taken in

this regard is the launch of an e-commerce website

in October 2017 as a trade facilitation programme

that provides an online trading platform for the

small and medium scale entrepreneurs to sell their

quality products locally and internationally. Similar

projects that make use of the existing delivery

channels and modern technology would enable

the DOP to reach a wider customer base while

minimising losses in the future.

Water Supply and Irrigation

During 2017, the National Water Supply and

Drainage Board (NWS&DB) continued to play

an important role in improving access to water

supply in the country. Accordingly, the NWS&DB

provided 126,701 new water supply connections,

raising the total number of connections to

2.2 million by end 2017, reporting a growth of

6.1 per cent over the previous year. The percentage

of island-wide non-revenue water, i.e. the difference

between the volume of water pumped into the water

supply system and the volume of water that is billed

as authorized consumption, decreased marginally

to 25.2 per cent in 2017, from 25.6 per cent in

2016. With increasing water scarcity, population

growth and urbanisation, better management

of non-revenue water is becoming increasingly

important. Thus, more emphasis is needed

on further reducing non-revenue water, which

would improve the financial viability of NWS&DB,

enabling improved access to safe drinking water

through increased supply. NWS&DB initiated five

projects in Galle, Attampitiya, Thambuththegama,

Katana and Matara to provide safe drinking water

and sanitation services. Total estimated cost of

these projects, which are to be funded by local and

foreign borrowings, is approximately Rs. 46 billion,

resulting in around 478,315 new water connections

to the system. Meanwhile, as per the HIES-2016 of

DCS, the North Central, Sabaragamuwa, Central

and Uva Provinces had the lowest level of access

to safe drinking water, ranging from 71.2 per cent

to 79.4 per cent, with Nuwara Eliya, Anuradhapura

and Badulla having the lowest access to safe

drinking water at the district level. Thus, it is

essential to implement projects focusing on these

regions in order to improve living standards in the

country. In 2018, the NWS&DB plans to implement

12 projects for the supply of water in the North

Central, Central, Southern, Northern, Eastern and

Western provinces, at an estimated cost of about

Rs. 245.6 billion.

Profitability of the NWS&DB declined during

2017. According to the unaudited provisional

financial statements, total revenue increased by

2.1 per cent to Rs. 25.6 billion, while the operational

and maintenance cost also increased by 6.6 per

cent to Rs. 24.9 billion. Consequently, the NWS&DB

registered an operational profit of Rs. 738 million

in 2017, compared to an operational profit of

Rs. 1,759 million recorded in the preceding year.

During 2017, the Department of Irrigation

(DI) continued their efforts to improve the

irrigation schemes in the country, with the aim of

supporting the agriculture sector. Accordingly, the

DI commenced two irrigation projects in Polonnaruwa

and Monaragala districts in 2017. The Polonnaruwa

District Irrigation Development Project was allocated

Rs. 400 million and achieved a financial progress of

52 per cent by end 2017. Meanwhile, the 'Wellassa

Navodaya' Accelerated Irrigation Project, which

plans to rehabilitate existing major and medium

irrigation schemes in the Monaragala district,

was allocated Rs. 50 million. At the same time,

18 major irrigation schemes were allocated

Rs. 8,542.6 million of which Rs. 4,172 million was

spent on Yan Oya and Rs. 603 million on Kalugal

Oya. DI and the Mahaweli Authority engaged in the

Climate Resilience Improvement Project (CRIP) as

implementing agencies to increase the resilience

of hydraulic infrastructure against future floods and

droughts. The project covers 21 major irrigation

schemes in nine regions with a total awarded

cost of Rs. 4,750 million. Further, renovation of

large dams under the 'Dam Safety and Water

Resources Planning' project continued during the

year, covering major dams such as Rajanganaya,

Angamuwa and Mahawilachchiya. However, to

get the maximum benefit from the investment

in irrigation schemes, it is necessary to maintain

the retention capacity of the reservoirs, which is

currently declining as a result of silting. Therefore,

whilst taking action to de-silt existing reservoirs

to enhance their capacity, it is necessary to take

measures against deforestation and soil erosion,

which are the main causes of silting in reservoirs.

At the same time, a comprehensive evaluation is

needed on the existing irrigation schemes in view

of changing weather patterns, which have changed

drastically during the recent past, thus challenging

the traditional cultivation and harvesting seasons

and regions.

3.3 Social Infrastructure Policies,

Institutional Framework and Performance

Health

The government continued its efforts to

improve healthcare facilities to the general

public during 2017. Accordingly, Emergency

Treatment Units (ETU) were constructed at

the Teaching Hospital Jaffna, District General

Hospitals in Kalutara and Polonnaruwa, and the

Base Hospital in Kalmunai North, with the aim of

improving ETU facilities in the country. In addition,

the clinical building and out-patient department

complex of the District General Hospital in Kalutara

and the Epilepsy unit at the National Hospital of

Sri Lanka were completed during 2017. Meanwhile,

the construction work of an Ambulatory Care

Centre at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, a

maternity ward complex at the Teaching Hospital

Kurunegala, an accident service and wards

complex at the Teaching Hospital Ragama, and

three cancer hospitals in Thellipalei, Kandy and

Matara was in progress during the year. According

to provisional data for 2017, the 612 government

hospitals in the state health sector had 3.6 beds

for 1,000 persons in the country. In addition, there

were 105 government Ayurvedic hospitals with

5,167 bed capacity. There was one qualified doctor

for every 1,054 persons and one nurse for every

627 persons in these government hospitals by end

2017.

During 2017, Sri Lanka experienced

outbreaks of several communicable diseases,

including record levels of incidence and

deaths related to the Dengue epidemy. Dengue

prevalence increased by 237.4 per cent during 2017

compared to the preceding year, registering 186,101

Dengue cases, which translates into 868 cases

per 100,000 of the population. Higher incidence of

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

103

Dengue was due to the heavy monsoon rains during

the month of May, expansion of potential breeding

grounds and improper garbage disposal. Meanwhile,

the fatality rate related to Dengue (i.e. deaths as a

percentage of total number of Dengue cases reported

for the period) was 0.24 per cent during 2017, higher

than the 0.18 per cent recorded in the preceding

year. The Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous

Medicine (MOH) conducted various activities to

minimise the morbidity and mortality due to Dengue

by promoting proactive case management, early

diagnosis and vector control activities. Accordingly, a

special Dengue Unit was established at the Infectious

Disease Hospital (IDH), while Rs. 68 million was

allocated to establish High Dependency Units at 10

selected major hospitals. With the aim of promptly

diagnosing Dengue, the laboratory facilities at major

state hospitals were upgraded and the government

took steps to lower the fees charged by private

laboratories for Dengue diagnostic tests. In addition,

a mass scale Dengue vector control programme

was implemented during 2017 in collaboration with

the armed forces and the Police, and over 1,000

mosquito prevention field assistants were recruited to

carry out premises inspections and other preventive

activities to minimise breeding grounds. Meanwhile,

an Influenza outbreak was also reported during the

first half of 2017, causing 89 Influenza related deaths.

In addition, a total of 3,626 Leptospirosis patients and

48 related deaths were recorded during the year. The

MOH conducted comprehensive public awareness

campaigns with the aim of preventing the spreading

of Influenza and Leptospirosis. Recurrence of

communicable epidemies and increasing severity

of the epidemies warrant strengthening of outbreak

preparedness activities, drawing support from all

stakeholders in the economy.

The MOH continued with its initiatives

to prevent and control acute and chronic

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), amidst

the considerably high prevalence of NCDs in

the country. According to the Demographic and

Health Survey (DHS) – 2016 conducted by the

DCS, the percentage of people suffering from

heart disease, high blood pressure, wheezing,

diabetes and high blood cholesterol during the

12-month period preceding the survey was

2.2 per cent, 8.2 per cent, 5 per cent, 5.7 per

cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile,

among the households surveyed, the prevalence

of high blood pressure, diabetes and high blood

cholesterol was highest in the Colombo district.

The percentage of households with at least one

member who smoked tobacco was 33.9 per cent,

while 28.9 per cent of the households had at

least one member consumed smokeless tobacco.

Meanwhile, 37.3 per cent of the households had at

least one member consuming alcohol. This indicates

that a considerable portion of the population has

consumption habits that increase the risk of NCDs.

These risky consumption patterns are highest

among the lowest wealth quintile. Further, among

ever-married women, 31.9 per cent was found to

be overweight and 13.3 per cent obese, indicating

a high-risk level for NCDs among females, which

is reflected by high incidence levels of high blood

pressure, diabetes and high blood cholesterol

reported for females in comparison to males.

Considering the increasing prevalence of NCDs,

which are associated with unhealthy lifestyles and

consumption habits, the MOH continued preventive

actions to curtail NCDs. Accordingly, various

awareness programmes were implemented at the

grass-root level as well as through the mass media,

especially targeting school children, teachers

and youth with a view to reducing unhealthy diet

habits, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical

inactivity. During 2017, the MOH continued with

work-place screening programmes, outreach

clinics that target the population in inaccessible

regions, and Healthy Lifestyle Centres, which aim

at screening apparently healthy people between

the ages of 40 to 65 years.

Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown

aetiology (CKDu) continued to receive

attention from healthcare providers, academics

and policy-makers due to its adverse socio-

economic impact, especially on low-income

households. During 2017, 25,512 CKD/CKDu

patients were reported from 11 high risk districts.

The number of CKD/CKDu patients was high in

Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts and the

prevalence, i.e. number of CKD cases reported as

a percentage of the total population, was also high

in Badulla and Ampara districts. According to the

DHS–2016, CKD prevalence was 0.6 per cent in

the country. Currently, screening of population in

high risk districts is being carried out through the

analysis of serum creatinine among people above

the age of 20 years, as an early diagnostic measure

for CKD/CKDu. Meanwhile, kidney dialysis facilities

were improved in the CKDu prevalent areas, with

the commissioning of dialysis units at the Base

Hospitals in Kebethigollewa and Mahiyanganaya

and the Teaching Hospital Kandy. Meanwhile, new

Renal Units will be established at the Teaching

Hospitals in Jaffna and Batticaloa, Base Hospital

Hambantota, District General Hospital Trincomalee

and Provincial General Hospital Badulla. In addition,

278 new haemodialysis machines were provided

to government hospitals in high-risk areas. Further,

research work which aims to identify the causes for

CKDu continued during 2017 although conclusive

results have not yet been obtained.

During 2017, the private sector continued

to play a major role in providing healthcare

services. According to the HIES–2016 conducted

by the DCS, 14.6 per cent and 15.7 per cent of the

households have received services from private and

government hospitals, respectively, in the form of

out-patient treatment within a period of one month

prior to the survey, indicating the notable importance

of private healthcare sector. According to the MOH,

181 private hospitals with the capacity of 5,792 beds

were registered with the Private Health Services

Regulatory Council (PHSRC) by end 2017. Given the

vital role played by the private healthcare providers,

it is important to ensure a high level of quality and

competitive pricing for healthcare services provided

by the private sector. To this end, it is essential to

make it mandatory for all private medical institutions,

including individual healthcare service operators,

to register with the PHSRC and require regular

inspections and observations to ensure that these

healthcare providers adhere to National Guidelines

and Standards for patient care, treatment and

conducting of preventive services.

Education

The government has taken various

measures, including the implementation of the

13 years of guaranteed education policy, to

improve school participation rates and align

the general education sector with labour market

requirements for skills as well as aspirations

of students. Under the ‘13 years of guaranteed

education’ policy, a new vocational subject stream

has been introduced after the G.C.E Ordinary Level

examination, in selected schools. This new stream

aims to enhance the vocational and technical

skills of students, for increased career and higher

education prospects, irrespective of the students’

performance at the Ordinary Level examination.

The vocational stream will be operational in

schools on a staggered basis under three stages of

a pilot project. Stage I of the project commenced in

October 2017 in 42 selected schools. The National

Institute of Education (NIE) developed curricula for

nine generic subjects and 26 vocational subjects

for the new stream while training 522 teachers

under this programme. The Stage II of the pilot

project is planned to commence in May 2018. In

this regard, 150 schools, with at least one school

in each education zone, have been selected.

Stage III of the project will expand up to 500

provincial and national schools in 2019 and 1,000 in

2020. Meanwhile, free school uniforms and school

shoes programmes were carried out benefitting

4.3 million students and 650,000 students,

respectively. The mid-day meal programme funded

by the World Food Programme was implemented in

through Grade 1 to 112 stood at 88.75 per cent,

while gross survival rates for males and females

were recorded as 86.54 per cent and 91.03 per

cent, respectively.

The government continued to improve the

quality of general education while reducing

disparities across schools. During 2017, 537

teachers passed out from teacher training colleges,

while around 3,000 are currently being trained at

these colleges. In addition, the Ministry of Education

conducted numerous teacher training programmes

to improve the teaching quality in general education,

particularly in relation to STEM education (Science,

Technology, Engineering and Mathematics

subjects), English, other foreign languages and

aesthetic subjects. Several training programmes

were conducted during the year, targeting teachers

of plantation sector schools and Tamil medium

schools in the Northern, Eastern, North Western

and North Central Provinces. Meanwhile, 40

teachers were trained on new teaching techniques

in Autism education while 30 special education

teachers received training on sign language and

Braille education to enhance the quality of education

provided for students with special needs. In order to

reduce disparities in physical infrastructure facilities

across schools, 9,063 provincial schools and 282

national schools are currently being developed

through the construction of new classrooms,

technical buildings, laboratories, water supply

schemes, etc., under the ‘Nearest School is the

Best School’ concept. Meanwhile, funds were

allocated through the annual budget of the Ministry

of Education to rehabilitate schools damaged by

floods and landslides in disaster affected districts.

Moreover, the construction work of zonal ICT centres

Dimubulagala and Nivithigala was also completed,

while the construction of three other centres was in

progress during 2017. However, there were 3,148

schools with less than 10 teachers during 2017

highlighting a possible insufficiency in the teaching

cadre in a considerable number of schools.

During 2017, measures were taken by the

Ministry of Education to maintain the quality

standards in the general education sector.

During the year, 7,347 schools were evaluated by

the Ministry of Education, Provincial Departments

of Education, Zonal and Divisional Education

offices, while 7,549 schools were evaluated through

school internal evaluation committees with the

objective of ensuring minimum standards of quality

in general education. Meanwhile, 16 government-

approved private schools were monitored through

the provincial and zonal authorities. However,

international schools are not within the purview

of the Ministry of Education, or the provincial or

zonal authorities, although the number of students

enrolling in these schools has been rising. Therefore,

it is crucial to set-up a mechanism to monitor and

evaluate the quality of education provided by these

international schools by engaging stakeholder

representatives in the evaluation process.

Meanwhile, there is room for further improvement

in terms of maintaining quality standards in general

education. Hence, in addition to training teachers

on subject matters and general teaching skills,

all staff engaged in education services should be

trained on best practices in handling educational,

behavioural and socio-economic issues related

to children while establishing effective complaint

handling procedures to resolve issues pertaining to

school administration and mistreatment of students.

During the year under review, the non-state

participation in the general education sector

continued to be significant. During 2017, there

were 106 private schools (excluding international

schools) and 753 Pirivenas providing general

education. The student population in private

schools (excluding international schools) increased

by 1.6 per cent during 2017, in comparison to the

preceding year. However, the number of students

studying in Pirivenas declined by 6.3 per cent

during this period. Meanwhile, there were 81,103

students enrolled in 245 international schools,

based on provisional responses to a survey carried

out by the Ministry of Education in 2017.

The government continued with its efforts to

enhance the accessibility of tertiary education

through state-owned universities while improving

the quality of university education. During

2017, the University Grants Commission (UGC)

approved seven new faculties, 39 new departments

and 33 new degree programmes offered by the

state universities. Online application for university

admissions was made compulsory and the

admission process was streamlined during 2017 to

reduce the time gap between the release of G.C.E.

Advanced Level examination results and student

admissions to state universities. The UGC and the

Ministry of Higher Education and Highways are in

the process of establishing a new independent

Quality Assurance and Accreditation Authority

to strengthen and regulate the quality assurance

process of both state and non-state universities.

Meanwhile, a Directorate of Quality Assurance

has been established at the UGC for continuous

quality assurance in state universities and 42 quality

assurance reviews in Humanitarian and Social

Sciences degree programmes have been completed

during 2017. The UGC commenced monitoring

and evaluating state university degrees through a

mechanism of self-reporting by universities, based

on Internal Quality Assurance Unit performance

scorecards. Meanwhile, a grievance redress

mechanism was established to prevent ragging,

sexual and gender-based violence within universities

giving opportunities for students to make complaints

through an online portal, email and 24/7 call centre.

The private sector continued to play an

increasingly important role in providing tertiary

education alongside the state universities.

As at end 2017, there were 16 Non-State Higher

Education Institutions (NSHEI) offering 99

accredited local degree programmes. Meanwhile,

medical students from all state universities

abstained from attending lectures, tutorials and

clinical training due to student union action

since January 2017, whereas medical doctors in

government hospitals also carried out strikes on

several occasions as trade union actions against

the medical degree offered by the South Asian

Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). As

a result, there was a notable impact on the state

university education system and the overall health

sector. The Presidential Commission appointed in

this regard decided to abolish SAITM and absorb

current SAITM students to the Kotalawala Defence

University (KDU), establish a new non-state,

not-for-profit medical degree awarding institution

to commence operations in 2019, and establish

minimum standards for medical education and

clinical training monitored by the Sri Lanka Medical

Council, while ensuring that the KDU and the

proposed entity offer high quality medical education

in line with these standards. State universities

resumed their normal activities in December 2017.

However, the discord created by this issue has

serious ramifications on the current and prospective

medical student population in state universities

due to the nearly one year delay in completing

their degree programme, as well as university

entrance for the next cohort. Further, the overall

health sector is also affected due to the delay in

recruiting new medical officers to the health sector

cadre. The government needs to ensure that this

issue would not hinder private sector participation

in tertiary education in the medium to long-term, as

state resources are inadequate to fulfil the country’s

higher education needs. Since state universities

do not have the capacity to provide education to

all those who qualify, private sector involvement

in the provision of university education needs to

be encouraged along with appropriate regulations

and a quality assurance process in place across all

disciplines of studies.

During the year under review, the Technical

and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)

sector continued to enhance opportunities

to cater to the needs of the labour market.

As at end 2017, there were 819 registered

institutions in the TVET sector, including 333 public

institutions and 486 private and non-governmental

institutions. These institutions offered 2,972

accredited TVET courses while 65,212 National

Vocational Qualification certificates were issued

by these institutions during 2017. The Tertiary and

Vocational Education Commission introduced an

assessment monitoring programme with the aim

of aligning the trainees’ competencies with the

National Competency Standards. During the year,

424 awareness programmes were carried out

to attract students for Technical Colleges by the

Department of Technical Education and Training.

Further, 28 awareness programmes on the Self

Employment Promotion Initiative (SEPI) and four

programmes on SEPI Loan Scheme were also

implemented during the year under review.

Housing and Urban Development

The government, through the Ministry of

Housing and Construction (MHC), the Ministry

of Megapolis and Western Development

(MMWD), and other relevant authorities,

continued to provide appropriate housing

and utilities to those in need while seeking to

facilitate orderly urbanisation in the country.

According to the HIES – 2016 of the DCS, out of

all types of housing (shelter), 0.8 per cent of the

houses in the country are slums/shanties, while

0.2 per cent could not be classified into a standard

housing category. Furthermore, 10.3 per cent of

the houses were less than 250 square feet, while

4.5 per cent, 4.4 per cent and 8.1 per cent of the

houses have semi-permanent walls, floors and

roofs, respectively. Meanwhile, 8.3 per cent of the

houses had no toilet of its own and 7.8 per cent of

the households had no access to drinking water

facilities within 100 metres of the house. Only

21.4 per cent of households had their garbage

collected by local authorities. These statistics

indicate that the government has a substantial

role to play in fulfilling housing requirements

of the needy, with access to basic amenities,

while ensuring that urbanisation takes place in a

sustainable manner.

The MHC continued to study the current

housing needs of the country to introduce a new

National Housing Policy while implementing

numerous programmes to provide decent

housing facilities for all. The formulation of the

new policy reached its final stage by the end of

2017 and is expected to be implemented in 2018.

The Treasury had allocated Rs. 6,820.2 million

for the National Housing Development Authority

(NHDA), and the Urban Settlement Development

Authority for 2017, while Rs. 1,118.5 million raised

internally was also utilised for various projects

of these authorities. The NHDA granted 3,000

free-hold and 5,000 lease-hold deeds to

beneficiaries. Meanwhile, continuing with the

efforts to provide decent housing facilities to every

family, the NHDA carried out a number of housing

projects. The Northern Province and Batticaloa

District Housing Development Programme and

the Bogasweva (Vauniya District) Housing Project

provided land, a monetary grant and access

to utilities for families displaced by the internal

conflict. Meanwhile, a survey has been carried out

by the MHC together with District and Divisional

Secretariats and based on the survey, 250,604

low-income families have been identified as those

who lack ownership of land to build houses. The

Grama-Shakthi model village housing programme

commenced during the year to provide land and cash

grants for 1,304 such families to meet their housing

requirements. The ‘Viru Sumithuru’ programme

aims at constructing or renovating 3,650 houses

for families of officers of the armed forces who lost

their lives or became disabled. The NHDA provided

concessionary loan facilities through Bank of Ceylon

and National Savings Bank under the ‘Sonduru

Piyasa’ bank loan programme, to assist low-income

households who hope to extend or complete their

houses. Further, the NHDA continued Lunawa,

Kotiyagala, Horana and Rajgama housing projects,

the scattered housing programme, and the

middle-income housing programme, aiming to

provide housing facilities to vulnerable groups such

as low-income and Tsunami-affected families.

The NHDA also undertook planning activities

pertaining to the Venerable Sobhita Nahimigama

Development Project in Vilachchiya and the Beire

Lake Housing Project in 2017. Further, housing

grants have been provided to kidney patients to

build new houses or upgrade their existing housing

facilities as well.

With rapid urbanisation, the demand for

and supply of condominiums has increased

substantially within the past decade, warranting

modifications to the existing legal framework

regarding condominium development to

safeguard the rights of home-buyers. Generally,

condominium property developers sell condominium

units during the pre-construction period. However,

some developers refrain from registering the

provisional condominium plan before the sale of

units and hence, buyers purchase a property which

is not legally registered. Further, the existing legal

framework does not impose mandatory obligations

on the property developer to disclose potential

issues that may affect the rights of the prospective

buyer such as in the event of an expansion with

additional units, developer’s background and

funding used for the project etc. Recognising the

loopholes in the existing legal structure related to

condominium properties, the MHC is in the process

of amending the Condominium Management

Authority Act No. 10 of 1973 and the Apartment

Ownership (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1999,

in order to meet the present-day requirements of the

condominium development industry in Sri Lanka.

With these amendments, property developers will

be mandatorily obliged to register the provisional

condominium plan prior to the sale of units.

The Construction Industry Development

Authority (CIDA) implemented policy initiatives

to support sustainable urban development,

urban living and housing construction in

Sri Lanka. During 2017, the CIDA implemented

the National Policy on Construction, which was

approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in November

2016. Further, the CIDA formulated the national

policy on high-rise buildings together with the

MMWD in order to introduce proper standards to

the construction of vertical structures which are

taking place at a considerable pace and scale.

A committee appointed by the CIDA, in 2017,

studied alternatives for river-sand in construction

and formulated an action plan to implement certain

recommendations, in order to address the dearth

of sand caused by the new restrictions imposed

in 2015 on sand mining activities in rivers. The

CIDA trained more than 11,000 youth in 2017

as construction industry workers. Further, the

National Procurement Commission has issued

guidelines related to the release of retention

money of contractors upon the submission of an

unconditional on demand bank guarantee or at the

end of the defect notification period of construction

projects. Meanwhile, a new Payment Guarantee

Security Act is being drafted by the Ministry of

Finance to ensure that construction contractors are

paid on time as per the conditions of the contracts.

These steps are aimed to ease the cash-flow issues

faced by construction contractors, supporting the

sustenance of the overall construction industry in

the country.

Work relating to the Colombo Port City

project, which is one of the key projects initiated

towards greater urbanisation, advanced rapidly

throughout 2017. By the end of 2017, 63 per cent

of the reclamation work was completed together

with 38 per cent of rock delivery and breakwater

construction, 25 per cent of compaction work and

58 per cent of Chinese pods (concrete elements

of the breakwater). The reclamation work and

construction of breakwaters to build the Port City

are expected to be completed by mid-2019. The

construction of the Colombo International Financial

Centre building complex is expected to commence

before end 2018.

The MMWD implemented a host of urban

development projects in Sri Lanka through the

authorities under the purview of the Ministry.

The Western Region Megapolis Development Plan

(WRMDP) guided a diverse range of projects in 2017,

from road construction to flood impact mitigation

and waste disposal, with the aim of developing the

Western region to meet internationally acclaimed

standards of city development while resolving

issues that arise due to urbanisation. These projects

included the Greater Colombo Urban Transport

Development Project (3K Project) that rehabilitates

key roads, the Metro-Colombo Urban Development

Project that aims to reduce the impact of floods and

develop drainage systems, the Western Region

Transport Development Project which comprises

restructuring of bus services, introduction of the

rapid transit system and the inland water-based

passenger transport system, and the greater

Colombo Flood Protection and Environment

Development Project. A feasibility study for a

light-rail transit system for Colombo was also

conducted with Japanese government assistance.

The collapse of the landfill site at

Meethotamulla in April 2017 highlights the

need for prudent action on waste management,

especially in urban areas. With the aim of

establishing sustainable long-term solutions

for waste disposal in the Colombo Metropolitan

region, the government has taken steps to develop

worked-out limestone quarries in Aruwakkalu,

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

111

Puttalam into a sanitary landfill for the disposal of

municipal solid waste that will be generated in the

Metro-Colombo Region for at least 20 years, with

waste being transferred using rail transportation

from Colombo. The rail transfer will take place from

Kelaniya to the sanitary landfill at Aruwakkalu. The

Ministry has already completed the topographic

survey and geo-technical investigation of

Aruwakkalu and Kelaniya, preparation of the

conceptual design, feasibility report and the

Environmental Impact Assessment. Meanwhile,

plans are underway to rehabilitate Bloemendhal

and Meethotamulla landfill sites and covert them to

urban parks with financial and technical assistance

of the World Bank and Asia Infrastructure

Investment Bank.

The MMWD undertook a multitude of other

projects through the Urban Development

Authority. These include Sukitha Purawara

project, Town Development projects of all nine

Provinces, relocation of the Manning market in

Peliyagoda, Lake Drive Bridge and Approach

Road Development in Rajagiriya, Matara Nilwala

River-side Park Development and Urubokka Town

Development. Meanwhile, activities related to the

Strategic Cities Development Project in Kandy,

Jaffna and Galle continued during 2017. Further,

the MMDW is expecting to relocate approximately

1,000 families residing in the Anuradhapura citadel

area to Lolugasweva since they are unable to obtain

general urban services due to their unauthorised

existence in an archaeological reservation area.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and

Development Corporation undertook wetland

management, maintenance of canals, lakes

and walkways, flood mitigation, development of

wetlands and lowlands throughout Sri Lanka and

implemented the Weras river storm water drainage

and environment improvement project in 2017.

Poverty Alleviation and Safety Nets

Reflecting the socio-economic developments

in recent years, overall poverty levels of the

country have declined, but disparities remain at

provincial and district levels, posing challenges

in terms of ensuring equitable economic

growth. The results of the HIES - 2016 of the

DCS reveal that the poverty level in the country, as

reflected by the Poverty Headcount Ratio (PHCR),

has further declined to 4.1 per cent, from 6.7 per

cent as per the HIES – 2012/13. This decline in

the PHCR was seen in the urban, rural and estate

sectors. However, in comparison to the national

PHCR, the estate sector PHCR was considerably

higher. At the district level, Kilinochchi district

recorded the highest PHCR of 18.2 per cent, while

the lowest PHCR of 0.9 per cent was reported

from the Colombo district. According to the HIES

- 2016, the number of poor in absolute terms, i.e.

the number of persons below the official poverty

line (OPL)3, stood at 843,913. At the district level,

the highest number of poor persons was recorded

in the Kandy district, while the lowest number was

in the Mannar district. However, according to the

DCS, there is a considerable number of people

in the non-poor population just above the OPL.

Accordingly, if the value of the OPL rise by 10 per

cent, the PHCR would increase to 6.1 per cent,

resulting in the population below the poverty line

increasing to 1,255,702 persons.

Poverty levels have steadily decreased

during the past two decades, while the disparity

in terms of household income has marginally

declined. Accordingly, household income

inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient,

declined to 0.45 based on the estimates of the

3 OPL is the real per capita expenditure per month for a person fixed at a specific welfare level with the consumption expenditure of food and non-food items. The OPL for 2016 is Rs. 4,166.

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

112

HIES - 2016, from 0.48 in the HIES - 2012/13.

However, the poorest 20 per cent accounted for

only 4.8 per cent of the total income, while the

richest 20 per cent have earned 50.8 per cent of

the total income, indicating the extent of income

disparity, despite the rising income levels of the

country as reflected through per capita GDP

estimates. The income equality can be further

improved by revisiting the income redistributive

policies of the country and improving economic

opportunities, particularly for poor households.

Strategies to address this issue include

ensuring better education opportunities for the

existing labour force and future entrants while

encouraging higher labour force participation,

particularly among the female population.

Sri Lanka declared 2017 as the ‘Year of Poverty

Alleviation’, reiterating its commitment towards

uplifting livelihoods in ensuring inclusive growth

in line with the Sustainable Development Goals

(SDGs) of the United Nations. To achieve the

target of no poverty by 2030 under the SDGs,

the Department of Samurdhi Development

(DSD) prepared and implemented a people

empowerment programme in 2017, targeting

to empower 125,000 families by selecting nine

families from each Grama Niladhari division. The

empowerment programme aims to uplift poor

families through education, entrepreneurship and

employment with livelihood development, market

promotion and model village programmes together

with micro-finance facilities. Since financial inclusion

is vital to enhance economic opportunities of the

low-income earners, the formal financial sector

also should develop financial products appropriate

for underprivileged segments of the population.

Continued investment in safety nets would

be an integral part of the poverty alleviation

programme. In this context, the HIES - 2016 has

explored the impact of social protection programmes

on poverty, based on the information of 13 such

programmes launched by the government.

Accordingly, social protection transfers have

lifted 2.6 per cent of the poor population out of

poverty. Of these social protection schemes, it

was found that pension transfers had the highest

contribution towards poverty alleviation, in the

absence of which the PHCR would increase to

5.7 per cent. Meanwhile, absence of Samurdhi

will increase PHCR only up to 4.3 per cent,

indicating the importance of better targeting of this

social assistance programme. There is a strong

case for improving the design and targeting of the

social safety net with a focus on cash transfers

rather than subsidies which distort resource

allocation. The DSD continued with its social safety

net programmes, disbursing Rs. 39.7 billion to

1,388,242 families under the Samurdhi Subsidy

Programme during 2017 and Rs. 1,054 million to

251,524 beneficiaries under the Samurdhi Social

Security Benefit Scheme. The DSD also granted

653,370 loans amounting to Rs. 42.3 billion through

the Samurdhi Community-based banking network

to poor and low-income families during the year.

Meanwhile, according to DHS – 2016 of the DCS,

the prevalence of stunting (lower height for age),

underweight (lower weight for age) and wasting

(lower weight for height) among children under five

years were 17 per cent, 21 per cent and 15 per

cent, respectively.4 Further, 16 per cent of newborn

4. According to ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017’ report published by the FAO, the prevalence of undernutrition in the total population of Sri Lanka was 22.1 per cent for 2014-2016, which is an improvement compared to 29.4 per cent prevalence reported for 2004-2006 period. According to the report, the prevalence of undernutrition in Sri Lanka is high compared to its regional peers.

children born during the five year period before the

DHS – 2016 survey, reported a low birth weight

(i.e. below 2.5kg). Considering the importance of

improving the nutritional health of mothers and

children, the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs

also continued numerous programmes during 2017.

Nutritional food packages for expectant mothers

were distributed among 372,407 beneficiaries at a

cost of Rs. 5.4 billion by the Ministry in 2017. In

addition, social protection programmes aimed at

child protection and early childhood development

were also conducted. Although extreme poverty

levels have come down, there exist numerous

challenges in ensuring the eradication of poverty

through sustainable inclusive growth. With the

decline in poverty levels, the population that

remain below the low-income threshold would be

the hardest to uplift due to the failure of overall

income elevation schemes in addressing some

of their challenges. Hence, social safety nets

would have to focus on the vulnerable sectors of

the economy, with a particular emphasis on the

elderly and the differently abled social groups. In

this context, the identification of genuinely poor

population is necessary to reap the full benefits

from the resources allocated to these programmes.

In addition, there is the risk of a considerable

proportion of the population slipping back towards

poverty due to factors such as economic shocks

and natural disasters. Hence, social insurance

schemes should be made available to ensure

that the realised gains in poverty eradication are

maintained. Further, with the risk of increased

incidence of natural disasters, it is required to

strengthen the mitigation plans against natural

disasters and include a mechanism to rebuild the

livelihoods that have been affected by the disasters.

Environment

Natural disasters, such as drought and

floods, significantly hampered overall

economic growth during the past two years,

highlighting the importance of giving due policy

consideration to environment and disaster

mitigation. In addition to drought and floods,

Sri Lanka also encountered several other natural

and human-induced disasters such as cyclones,

landslides, drying-up of ground water due to

development activities and collapse of a garbage

landfill, though the impact of these disasters on

economic growth was relatively limited. During 2017,

the Ministry of Disaster Management implemented

several flood mitigation projects in Gampaha and

Puttalam and 239 disaster mitigation and safe

evacuation projects in 23 districts while purchasing

boats and equipment to strengthen the response

capacity for floods and landslides. Meanwhile, a

community-based early warning system covering

98 villages in Badulla, Nuwara Eliya and Kegalle

districts and development of risk maps for the same

areas were in progress during the year. Although,

IntroductionThe incidence and severity of disasters1 in Sri Lanka have increased in recent years, resulting in adverse implications across all sectors of the economy. Floods, cyclones, landslides and droughts have been the key natural and human induced disasters that have occurred in Sri Lanka during the past two decades, in terms of frequency and the overall impact. Animal attacks and lightning strikes also have caused a considerable loss of human lives. In addition, Sri Lanka has also experienced infrequent catastrophic events such as the tsunami, which too had a significant damaging impact on human lives and physical infrastructure. These disasters are a result of climate change as well as domestic factors, other than the tsunami in 2004 which was triggered by an ocean earthquake near the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. According to the Disaster Information Management System (DIMS) of the Disaster Management Centre (DMC)2, disasters that occurred in Sri Lanka during the 2013 - 2017 period have resulted in 837 deaths, 792 injured persons, 352 missing persons, 10,370 fully-destroyed houses and 90,040 partially damaged houses. Meanwhile, more recently, over two million people across various districts of the country were affected by severe drought conditions during 2017. Twelve of the twenty five districts were severely affected by the drought.

Economic Implications of DisastersWhile disasters directly cause distress at the individual and household levels, most also have far reaching economy wide implications, which pose numerous challenges to

BOX 2Disaster Management for a Resilient Economy

the economic stability of relatively small countries like Sri Lanka. Disasters can hamper production and lower the productivity of a country due to physical damage to production, losses to the labour force caused by deaths and injuries, reduced investment in human and physical capital due to decreased savings, destruction of public and private capital, and disruption to utilities. Most natural disasters generally affect agriculture activities directly, which in turn, have ripple effects on industrial and services sector activities through forward and backward linkages. During 2016 and 2017, agriculture activities of Sri Lanka contracted by 3.8 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively, due to adverse weather conditions. These supply-side disruptions triggered a rise in domestic inflation, particularly through a rise in food prices. The decline or slowdown in growth coupled with rising price levels would result in macroeconomic instability, reduce the country’s attractiveness as a tourist and foreign investment destination and retard the upliftment of living standards, dampening the effect of development efforts.

Disasters would also increase the country’s external dependence through higher food and fuel imports due to constrained domestic capacity, exerting pressure on the external current account. Sri Lanka had to import 747,800 MT of rice due to the decline in domestic paddy production during 2017. Following the bumper harvest in 2015, rice imports in 2016 was only 29,524 MT. Increased imports of petroleum and coal for energy generation also contributed to a deterioration of the country’s trade balance. Meanwhile, disasters cause a burden on the government budget, which is already under pressure, with increased expenses on disaster relief, rehabilitation activities and health services, resulting in a widening of the fiscal deficit.

1. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a disaster as an occurrence disrupting the normal conditions of existence and causing a level of suffering that exceeds the capacity of adjustment of the affected community.

2. The Disaster Management Centre was set-up in 2005 under the Disaster Management Act No.13 of 2005 with the objective of implementing disaster management functions assigned by the National Council for Disaster Management.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

During 2017, the government had to incur a cost that amounts to around 0.1 per cent of the GDP for flood and drought relief activities. Further, imbalances within the economy amidst frequent supply-side shocks would pose a challenge for the effective implementation of monetary policy.

Moreover, disasters generally have a disproportionately high adverse effect on low income households and thereby challenge the country’s efforts related to poverty reduction and inclusive growth promotion. The results of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey – 2016 show that if real per capita monthly expenditure declines by Rs. 100, the number of poor people in the country increases from 843,913 to 933,087, indicating a high concentration of non-poor population just above the poverty line. Such individuals have a higher probability of falling below the poverty line in the aftermath of disasters. Further, a recent cross-country study covering 147 countries has shown that households and firms get deeper into debt following natural disasters (Keerthiratne & Tol, 2017). In addition, more than a quarter of the labour force is engaged in agricultural activities in Sri Lanka. Hence, weather-related natural disasters affect the livelihoods of a large fraction of the country’s population. Therefore, frequent occurrence of disasters raises the vulnerability at both the macroeconomic and household levels, warranting increased attention to strengthening disaster management and mitigation programmes.

Risk of Natural Disasters in Sri LankaBased on the average WorldRiskIndex (WRI) scores for 2012-2016, Sri Lanka was ranked at 63rd position in the WRI (lower the rank, higher the risk level) amongst 171 countries, whereas India, Pakistan and Nepal were ranked at 75th, 73rd and 107th positions, respectively, indicating a higher disaster risk level in Sri Lanka, in comparison to some of its regional peers. Meanwhile, Bangladesh was at the 5th position due to the country’s frequent exposure to disasters (Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft, 2017). According to the WorldRiskReport - 2017, risks faced by a country not only depend on the probability of the occurrence of natural hazards and their severity, but also on the country’s vulnerability. These vulnerabilities can be divided into three components: country’s susceptibility, coping capacities and adapting capacities. Sri Lanka not only has a high exposure to natural disasters, but also has a high vulnerability particularly in terms of the weaker coping capacity of the country (Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft, 2017). This shows that although the exposure to natural disasters is inevitable, Sri Lanka has the potential to reduce the impact of disasters by broadening the scope of its disaster management programme from basic emergency relief activities to disaster forecasting, preparedness as well as adaptation and mitigation policies and measures.

With the overarching objective to create and facilitate an enabling environment, Sri Lanka already has a multi-hazard, multi-sector, multi-agency partnership oriented Comprehensive Disaster Management

Programme for 2014-2018 that is based on risk knowledge. In addition, there is a National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change Impacts of Sri Lanka: 2016 - 2025. Nevertheless, the loss of human lives, damages to public and private properties during recent disaster events indicate that there is significant room for improvement in disaster management and mitigation activities in Sri Lanka.

Source: WorldRiskReport - 2017Building Capacities to Cope with DisastersExperience from disaster prone countries, such as Japan, has shown that loss of human lives and damages to physical assets can be minimised by improving forecasting capabilities with regard to natural disasters and implementing effective early warning systems.Sri Lanka currently has several early warning systems, including early warning systems for Tsunami and landslides. However, heavy damages caused by floods and landslides in Sri Lanka were mainly due to poor forecasting of extreme weather conditions. Hence, the government needs to invest more on strengthening the country’s disaster forecasting and early warning systems in disaster-prone areas to cope with recurrent disasters. Although costly, investment in technologically advanced disaster forecasting and early-warning systems can be justified given the heavy burden exerted by natural disasters on households and the government budget in the long-term. On the other hand, better regional cooperation may provide solutions for much-needed disaster forecasting and early warning systems.

While early warning systems can reduce human and physical losses, other disaster preparedness activities also play a key role in mitigating damage caused by catastrophic events. For example, Bangladesh, which is frequently exposed to floods and cyclones, has been able to reduce the loss of human lives during hazardous events by constructing over 1,800 cyclone shelters and 200 flood shelters for evacuation purposes (Nawaz & Shah, 2011). However, experience during recent disaster events in Sri Lanka highlights issues related not only to poor forecasting and early warning systems, but also to evacuation procedures, poor disaster-related data management systems and ambiguous roles and responsibilities of different government institutions within the disaster management framework. These deficiencies led to higher casualties, slower responses to disasters,

lack of coordination in disaster relief measures and inefficient distribution of relief supplies. All stakeholders, including the Ministry of Disaster Management, other government and non-government institutions, and civil society should strive towards fulfilling their duties and responsibilities outlined by the country’s disaster management framework in a more effective and timely manner while following the necessary guidelines and procedures. Disaster preparedness activities of the country should include expanding necessary infrastructure facilities such as designated evacuation centres in all disaster-prone areas, enhancing data management in relation to risk mitigation, further training of personnel in disaster management activities and educating the public on safety measures and evacuation procedures. Moving beyond the ‘charity’ mind-set of civil society during disaster events, a volunteer disaster management task force could be set-up to streamline civil society engagement in disaster relief activities. Social media can be effectively used not only to disseminate early-warning signals, but also to organise such volunteer task forces. Moreover, post-disaster action plans should also be in place to support vulnerable social groups and address post-traumatic stress, in order to build capacity to better cope with disasters.

A national disaster risk financing strategy is important for Sri Lanka to reduce the fiscal burden, disbursement of funds for relief activities effectively and use of available funds for disaster mitigation activities efficiently. To this end, the World Bank Group has conducted a fiscal disaster risk assessment for Sri Lanka, including an analysis of contingent liabilities of the government caused by disasters. Based on the risk level of each disaster, which in turn depends on the frequency and severity of impact, the government can select different financing instruments to mitigate the fiscal risk of each type of disaster (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2016). For example, the government can use a contingent budget, annual budget allocations or a Natural Disaster Reserve Fund to mitigate the fiscal risk of high frequency, low impact disasters such as localised floods and landslides, which will ensure fast disbursement of funds for post-disaster activities. Further, insurance and additional sovereign catastrophic risk financing options can be used for low frequency, high impact disasters such as major floods, major earthquakes and tropical cyclones. The World Bank Group offers several sovereign risk financing options, such as Development Policy Loans with Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option3, which allow member countries to access immediate liquidity during natural disasters, and Catastrophe Bonds and Weather Derivatives that allow countries to transfer the financial risk caused by natural disasters to global investors.

Insurance is increasingly used across many countries in the world as a disaster risk management strategy. However, insurance penetration, based on total premium as a percentage of GDP, stood at 1.2 per cent for

Sri Lanka in 2017. This is extremely low when compared to peer countries. The government has already taken steps to insure lives and properties, particularly all households and small business establishments, against natural disasters, excluding drought, up to a maximum of Rs. 2.5 million per household or business, under the Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme (NDIS) through the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF), thus reducing the burden on the government budget. However, it is important to promote private insurance of property against disasters, especially among higher income earners who can afford insurance. Meanwhile, the government also needs to strengthen the reinsurance of the NITF by extending the coverage to non-agricultural sectors as well.

Sri Lankan farmers rely more on borrowings from formal and informal sources than on crop insurance (Wickramasinghe, 2017), which is a better climate-risk management strategy. Crop insurance is successfully used in developing countries such as India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Thailand and Central America. Currently, there are two voluntary indemnity-based crop insurance schemes operating in Sri Lanka and an index-based insurance scheme, which is not commonly used at present. During 2008 Yala to 2017 Yala period, less than 3 per cent of the cultivated paddy lands in Sri Lanka had been insured, even under the less-efficient voluntary indemnity-based crop insurance schemes. However, when coupled with advanced technology, index-based insurance solutions are deemed to be more efficient with higher transparency, lower costs and timely pay-outs (Wickramasinghe, 2017). Hence, investing in meteorological equipment, promotion of crop insurance schemes, particularly index-based solutions, and educating farmers on crop insurance are imperative to enhance coping capacities of the farming community in facing natural disasters.

Reducing Exposure and Susceptibility to DisastersConsidering the increased frequency of flooding and landslides, resettlement of people away from disaster-prone locations is essential in the medium to long term. To this end, multi-hazard vulnerability assessments and risk-mapping are pre-requisites to identify risky areas and resettlements in low-risk areas. Designing houses that can better withstand regular disasters (for example, houses on stilts in flood-prone areas), revising land-use plans and building regulations based on risk levels and strictly enforcing those regulations are critical to minimise recurrent damages to buildings and settlements. While considering disaster risk levels, it is also important to consider livelihood, socio-cultural factors and infrastructure availability when resettling people in new locations, in order to prevent people moving back to familiar disaster-prone areas. On the other hand, structural mitigation methods, such as constructing drainage channels, constructing tanks to harvest high-intensity rainfall, desilting and rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems, and strengthening river banks, can be effectively used to reduce damage from 3. This option has been available for Sri Lanka since 2014

disasters. Investment in structural mitigation methods can be prioritised based on the expected losses from natural disasters to ensure efficient allocation of funds. Considering the historical data on direct and indirect costs arising from physical and private property damage caused by natural disasters, the World Bank Group has estimated Sri Lanka’s average expected loss due to disasters at Rs. 50 billion per annum, of which Rs. 32 billion results from flooding (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2016). Hence, higher investment in physical flood mitigation methods can substantially reduce the annual disaster losses to the country.

Multi-hazard risk assessment and environmental sustainability should be an integral part of all development activities in order to reduce the country’s susceptibility towards disasters. Unsustainable development activities can cause man-made disasters while aggravating natural disasters such as drought, floods and landslides. Since damage caused by these disasters can outweigh the benefits of these economic activities, sustainability should be central to all development activities. Further, minimising deforestation, reforesting upstream areas, clearing and restoring wetlands, and giving due consideration to groundwater system in development activities could considerably reduce the exposure to natural and man-made disasters. Meanwhile, coordination between the National Planning Department, disaster risk management authorities and relevant line ministries needs to be strengthened further to improve the sharing of multi-hazard risk assessment information regularly for planning and development activities.

Adapting to DisastersIn the context of climate change and increasing food demand, climate-smart agriculture practices, which integrate agriculture development with climate responsiveness, are becoming essential to achieve food security and far-reaching development goals. Use of climate-adapted genetic material such as short duration and agro-ecologically suited plant varieties, adoption of seasonal-adapted planting times and changing crop establishment techniques, rainwater harvesting systems and micro-irrigation, mulching and thatching and planting of cover crops are some of the key climate-smart agriculture practices that can be used in crop production. Further, perennial cropping systems, crop diversification and livestock integration, manure production and reduced use of chemical inputs will enhance land productivity and the overall environment while improving climate resilience of agricultural activities. Some of these climate-smart agriculture practices are currently adopted in various agriculture production systems in Sri Lanka, though the adoption of some other practices is still limited. However, scaling up of climate-smart agriculture practices in the long-run will require efficient extension services as well as improved access to specific markets by the farmers. At the same time, it is essential to enhance food processing and storage mechanisms and maintain sufficient agriculture

buffer stocks, to ensure food security of the country in the context of regular hazardous events. This needs to be accompanied with a change in consumption habits of people, such as the use of prepared/ processed food instead of fresh food alone.

Diversification is an effective adaptation method to reduce the vulnerability to disasters. Sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism and energy generation are all sensitive to climate-change-induced disasters. Generally, the farming community is more susceptible to frequent disasters due to lack of diversification in terms of crops as well as their income sources. Hence, agriculture development policies need to focus on providing institutional support for capacity building to the farming community to move beyond their traditional one crop cultivation practice to crop diversification, livestock integration and non-farm income generation. Expansion and diversification of the country’s energy sources should also be expedited to reduce heavy reliance on hydropower generation and shift towards other low-cost, eco-friendly energy sources. The growth strategy of the country should emphasise diversifying the export sector to reduce the vulnerability of export income to natural disasters.

ConclusionFrequent occurrence of disasters is becoming the ‘new normal’ for many countries including Sri Lanka. Disasters tend to have macroeconomic implications while obstructing the attainment of sustainable development goals. Although disasters cannot be avoided completely, the disaster risk and the consequences could be mitigated to a great extent by building coping capacities of the community, reducing the susceptibility and exposure to disasters and adapting to impending disasters. Therefore, disaster risk management and climate-change adaptation should be embedded in the national development policy framework by aligning and streamlining sectoral policies and regulations. Collaborative and well-coordinated actions of the government and non-government organisations and civil society are needed to build technological, physical and institutional capacities for effective disaster management and climate change adaptation. Nurturing of sustainable development needs to be embedded in the country’s long-term growth strategy, with a view to minimising the exposure to disasters, especially human-induced hazards.

are implementing various disaster mitigation and

management activities, these initiatives need to be

further strengthened through coordinated efforts

of the government, non-government organisations

and civil society, to minimise the occurrence and

impact of disasters.

During the year under review, the

government laid-down regulations in relation to

the production and use of polythene and plastic

related products, with the aim of minimising

the impact on the environment. Accordingly,

manufacturing of polythene or any polythene

product of 20 microns or below in thickness, food

wrappers made from polythene, high-density

polythene bags, food containers, plates, cups and

spoons from expanded polystyrene for domestic

usage was prohibited through gazette notifications

issued on 01 September 2017. Further, sale, offer

for sale, offer free of charge, exhibition or use of the

same products were also prohibited. In addition,

the open burning of refuse or other combustible

matters inclusive of plastics as well as the use of all

forms of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene

products or polypropylene products as decorations

are also not permitted. After reviewing the opinions

and concerns of the relevant stakeholders, including

polythene and plastic producers and users, this ban

came into full effect from 01 January 2018. While

this is a creditable step towards an eco-friendly

development path, it is also crucial to conduct

research on alternative products for the prohibited

plastic and polythene products, commercialise

such products and promote the use of alternative

products among the general public expeditiously.

The Central Environment Authority (CEA)

carried out a range of activities in relation to

regulating and monitoring, environmental

impact assessments and waste management,

with a view to supporting sustainable

economic growth. The CEA is responsible for

assessing the possible impact of projects on

the environment through environmental impact

assessments (EIA) and initial environmental

examinations (IEE). During 2017, the CEA granted

EIA approvals for 12 projects and IEE approvals

for 259 projects. Meanwhile, the CEA initiated

a ground water quality and industrial effluent

monitoring project in the Gampaha district with

the support of the Water Environment Partnership

Association (WEPA) in Japan. Moreover, under

the Pilisaru National Solid Waste Management

project, the CEA continued to fund establishing and

improving compost sites, bio gas plants and plastic

recycling centres. During 2017, the CEA continued

to operate the Green Park Waste Management

Centre at Dompe, handling general waste from

Dompe Pradeshiya Sabha and Colombo Municipal

Council, non-hazardous industrial waste and glass

wool from electricity generation companies. This

project consists of a landfill site, composting site as

well as a training centre.

During 2017, the government took steps

to rectify the environmental and social

issues caused by the Uma Oya Multipurpose

Development Project and the Meethotamulla

garbage landfill site, while minimising

associated future externalities on the

environment. Two water ingresses were

encountered during the construction of Headrace

Tunnel under the Uma Oya Multipurpose

Development Project and the issue was resolved

to a satisfactory level by end 2017. However,

these water ingresses resulted in lowering the

water levels in the domestic wells, drying-up of

natural springs and developing cracks on walls

and floors of the houses in several areas of the

Bandarawela Divisional Secretariat (DS) Division,

Ella DS Division and Haputale DS Division. Due

to delays in the excavation process caused by the

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

119

water ingresses, the project completion date is

likely to be extended from mid-2019 to mid-2020.

Proper environmental assessment and adoption

of strategies to minimise the environmental impact

of all development activities are crucial to reduce

the environmental damage and resultant social

issues caused by development projects. Following

the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage landfill

site, the government gave high priority to establish

long-term sustainable solutions for waste disposal

in 2017. The MMWD was assigned the responsibility

of the safe closure of the collapsed dump site.

Accordingly, in the short-term, the closure of the

garbage landfill site was completed and MMWD

is planning to rehabilitate Meethotamulla landfill

site into an urban park. As a long-term measure,

abandoned limestone quarries at Aruwakkalu will

be developed as a sanitary landfill site. The project

is expected to be completed by end 2020 and the

project recorded 20 per cent physical progress

by end 2017. Meanwhile, Cabinet approval was

granted to implement three waste-to-energy

projects with the participation of the private sector

and one such private company entered into a

power purchasing agreement with the CEB.

Deforestation, which has the potential to

create serious environmental damage, remains

a key policy concern for the country. During the

past decade, deforestation continued at a faster

pace than reforestation, owing to legal and illegal

logging, infrastructure development activities and

rapid urbanisation. Sri Lanka’s forest cover stood

at 1,951,472 hectares according to the Forest

Cover Estimation Survey conducted by the Forest

Department in 2010. The latest survey had been

conducted in 2015 using high resolution images

and field verifications of these images. However,

the results of the survey are still pending, delaying

the adoption of necessary policy actions to mitigate

deforestation. Meanwhile, a total of 10,226 hectares

of forests were deforested during the last decade

and infrastructure development initiatives may

have contributed significantly to this deforestation.

Concerns are further exacerbated by increased

number of reports of illegal forest clearing, logging,

and encroachment for human settlements during

the recent past. The extent deforested during 2017

increased marginally to 1,241 hectares, from 1,240

hectares in 2016, which is considerably above

the level in 2015 of 423 hectares. Meanwhile, the

extent reforested in 2017 was only 956 hectares,

whereas Sri Lanka has reforested more than 1,000

hectares in some years in the past. The number

of forest offences increased to 3,887 from 3,618

in 2016 and 2,545 in 2015. The volume as well as

the value of timber detected to have been illegally

logged increased in 2017, compared to 2016 and

2015. Meanwhile, there were only 99 detected

cases of smuggling of indigenous herbs in 2017,

compared to 220 in 2016. If immediate policy

attention is not paid to manage deforestation at a

sustainable level, this issue will potentially lead to

climate change and aggravate natural disasters

such as landslides, loss of biodiversity and land

degradation. With technological advancements

in the world, the government should consider

using innovative, low-cost technological options

to collect data and monitor deforestation for better

policymaking.
