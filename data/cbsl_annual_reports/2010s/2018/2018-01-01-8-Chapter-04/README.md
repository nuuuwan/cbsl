4.1 OverviewT

he general price level, as measured by

the consumer price indices, compiled by

the Department of Census and Statistics

(DCS), followed an overall increasing trend

and remained at comparatively higher levels

during 2017. Factors attributing to the observed

movement of the general price level were mainly

related to supply side developments of the

economy. The prolonged drought in most areas

of the country, from the latter part of 2016 and

throughout most of 2017, had an adverse impact

on key domestically produced food items, which

represent relatively high shares in all consumer

price measures, and thus exerted upward

pressure on their prices. However, the impact

was partly offset by the downward revisions

on import duties applicable on certain

imported food commodities. Higher prices of

non-food commodities, due to upward revisions

to administered prices of certain items, also

contributed to the upward trend in the general

price level. Accordingly, the year-on-year headline

inflation moved on an overall increasing trend

during the year. Furthermore, overall producer

prices also displayed an increasing trend

during the year, driven by increases in producer

prices of both agriculture and manufacturing

items. In terms of developments in real wages,

an increase was observed only in the informal

private sector, partly supported by labour supply

shortages in certain sectors, whilst an erosion

of real wages was observed in the formal sector

during 2017. The overall unemployment rate

declined compared to the previous year, despite

the decline in foreign employment opportunities,

thereby reflecting the increased job opportunities

within economy. However, unemployment

among youth, females and persons with higher

educational attainment continued to remain

at higher levels, despite concerns of labour

shortages across many emerging sectors, caused

by skills mismatches. In addressing the scarcity

of labour in the domestic market, provision of

demand driven training by vocational training

authorities in collaboration with the private

sector, and the introduction and implementation

of labour law reforms would play a prominent role

in attracting the untapped potential, particularly

in rural areas of the country.

4.2 Prices

Movements of the General Price Level

Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) measure

the overall price level of a basket of goods

and services used by an average household,

relative to a base period. The DCS, the authority

entrusted with the responsibility of compiling

official consumer price indices, compiles two such

indices, namely the National Consumer Price Index

(NCPI, 2013=100) and the Colombo Consumer

Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100). Movements of the

NCPI reflect price trends of selected consumer

items as well as the patterns of consumption and

expenditure of consumers at the national level,

while the CCPI reflects the same of consumers in

urban areas of the Colombo district. The NCPI has

a relatively larger share of expenditure on food than

in the CCPI, indicating that an average household,

representing the entire country, spends relatively

larger share of expenditure on items in the food

category. The general price level as measured by

these indices moved on an overall increasing trend

with mixed movements during 2017, attributing to

the increases in prices of items in the food category.

As observed in the previous years, the

movement of prices in the Food category was

very much in line with the prices of Volatile

Food1. The prices of Volatile Food, especially

that of rice and coconuts increased significantly

in 2017, compared to the previous year, owing to

supply disruptions caused by prolonged adverse

weather conditions. In order to reduce the negative

impact of supply side disturbances on consumer

prices, measures were taken by the government

to encourage rice imports. Consequently, the

prevailing tax structure on imported rice was

removed and only a Special Commodity Levy

1 Volatile Food includes rice, meat, fresh fish and sea food, coconuts, fresh fruits, vegetables, potatoes, onions and selected condiments.

(SCL) of Rs.15 per kg was imposed, with effect from

07 January 2017. The SCL was revised downward

on several instances and with the escalating retail

prices, a maximum retail price was also imposed

on several rice varieties while SCL was maintained

at 25 cents per kg from 27 July 2017 onwards. The

price of coconuts rose sharply during the second

half of 2017, mainly driven by low production as

a result of the lagged effect of prolonged drought

conditions. In order to curtail the increasing price of

coconuts, a maximum retail price of Rs.75 per nut

was imposed, with effect from 06 December 2017.

As a result, price of coconuts that prevailed at

record high levels during the second half of 2017,

declined gradually towards the end of the year.

Moreover, the prevailed tax structure applicable on

the importation of coconut kernel was removed and

an SCL of Rs.1 per kg was imposed on the same

with effect from 14 December 2017. The prices

of fresh fish moved on an increasing trend until

mid-year, mainly due to limited supply conditions

caused by restricted fishing activities, resulting from

adverse weather conditions that prevailed during

May 2017 and declined thereafter. The weighted

average prices of vegetables also increased in

2017, compared to the previous year, following

the normal seasonal pattern. The price of potatoes

followed an overall declining trend with mixed

movements whereas the prices of big onions and

red onions increased on an overall basis in 2017.

Within the Food category, prices of items

other than Volatile Food increased at a moderate

pace during 2017. The domestic prices of key

imported food items showed marginal increases in

2017, compared to the previous year. The price of

sugar increased in the domestic market in 2017,

in comparison to the previous year, partly due to

the upward revision to the SCL of imported sugar

on several occasions during the year, to encourage

domestic sugar production. Meanwhile, the price of

4

PRICES, WAGES, EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY

123

dhal, which was at higher levels at the beginning

of the year, declined gradually, thereby recording

lower prices compared to the previous year. In

order to contain the price pressure in the domestic

market, maximum retail prices were imposed on

prices of some food items, including sugar, dried

sprats, dhal and potatoes, in January 2017.

The prices of items in Non-food and other

categories moved on an overall increasing trend,

exerting some upward pressure on the general

price level. The administered price revisions to

selected Non-food items contributed towards this

increase in prices of the Non-food category. Upward

price revisions were made on the price of LP Gas

and bus fares, while a downward price revision was

made on the price of Kerosene oil. Consequently, the

increase observed in the prices of some prepared

food within the Restaurants and Hotels sub-category

during October 2017 could be attributed to the

increase in LP Gas prices in September 2017. The

increase in the price of a lottery ticket from Rs.20

to Rs.30 and the subsequent reversal of the same

was also observed in 2017. A marginal decline was

observed in internet charges with the removal of the

Telecommunication Levy on internet services. With

the introduction of volume based excise duty on liquor,

as per the Budget 2018, an increase in the prices

of arrack and a decline in the prices of beer were

observed during November and December 2017.

A decline in medical charges was observed during

June and July 2017 as a result of the government

intervention to reduce private hospital medical charges

for blood tests carried out to diagnose Dengue fever.

The reversal of the same was also observed in prices

after the Dengue epidemic began to dissipate.

Consumer Price Indices

National Consumer Price Index

The NCPI moved up from 119.3 index

points in January 2017 to 126.6 index points in

December 2017. On a month-on-month basis, the

NCPI increased during the first two months of 2017

before declining marginally in March and increased

thereafter until June 2017. However, the NCPI

recorded declines in both July and August 2017,

reversed its trend thereafter and moved on an

increasing path until the end of 2017. During 2017,

the movement of the NCPI was driven mainly by

the price movements of the Food category, while

a notable contribution from the Non-food category

was observed only in certain months.

Colombo Consumer Price Index

The CCPI moved up from 116.1 index

points in January 2017 to 122.9 index points in

December 2017. The movements of the CCPI

were in line with the movements of the NCPI,

however, at different magnitudes. In terms of

the CCPI, the movements were driven by the

Food category during the year, except in January

and November 2017 where the movement was

driven by the Non-food category. During 2017, a

notable contribution from the Non-food category

was observed in terms of the CCPI compared to the

marginal contribution of the same in terms of the

NCPI. This may be attributable to the comparatively

higher weight of the Non-food category in the CCPI

than in the NCPI.

Headline Inflation

Headline inflation, as measured by the

year-on-year change in the NCPI, exhibited

an overall increasing trend with mixed

movements during 2017. The NCPI based

headline inflation increased during the first

quarter of 2017 from 6.5 per cent in January to

8.6 per cent in March and gradually declined

during the second quarter of 2017. However, it

picked up again during the third quarter of 2017

and peaked at 8.8 per cent in October 2017,

before declining to 7.3 per cent in December

2017. The movement of year-on-year inflation

was highly determined by the base effect caused

by the changes in food prices during 2016 as well

as the introduction, suspension and re-imposition

of government taxes during 2016. Moreover,

monthly increases arising from high food

prices that prevailed during January, February,

September and October 2017 contributed towards

the increase in the year-on-year inflation in these

months. Meanwhile, the annual average NCPI

inflation gradually increased from 4.6 per cent in

January 2017 to 7.7 per cent in December 2017.

Year-on-year CCPI based headline inflation

also followed a trend similar to NCPI inflation.

As such, CCPI inflation, which was 5.5 per cent in

January 2017, peaked at 7.8 per cent in October

2017 and declined to 7.1 per cent in December

2017. The movement of the year-on-year CCPI

inflation was also driven by the base effect along

with the monthly movement of the prices of items

in the CCPI. The annual average CCPI inflation

increased from 4.3 per cent in January 2017 to

6.6 per cent in December 2017.

Core Inflation

The NCPI based year-on-year core inflation

moved on an overall declining trend during

the year. The moderate increases in Non-food

prices during the year, coupled with the base effect

caused by changes made to the government taxes

during 2016, contributed towards the declining

trend in year-on-year core inflation in 2017.

Accordingly, the NCPI based core inflation, which

was 7.1 per cent in January 2017, moved on a

declining trend to reach 2.7 per cent in December

2017. Meanwhile, the CCPI based core inflation,

which followed a similar trend, was 7.0 per cent

in January 2017, peaked at 7.3 per cent in March

2017 and declined to 4.3 per cent in December

2017.

Producer Price Inflation

The Producer’s Price Index (PPI, 2013 Q4=100),

compiled by the DCS, which measures the

average change over time in the prices

received by domestic producers of goods and

services, also followed an overall increasing

trend during 2017. The PPI covers producer’s

prices in Agriculture, Manufacturing and Utilities

(Electricity and Water Supply) sectors of the

economy. Producer prices in both Agriculture and

Manufacturing sectors increased during the year.

Meanwhile, producer prices in the Electricity and

Water Supply sector remained at stable levels

during the first and fourth quarters, while exhibiting

volatility during second and third quarters of the

year. The sharp increase observed in producer

prices of the Agriculture sector during the year was

due to prolonged adverse weather conditions, which

was reflected in consumer prices of food items.

Producer price inflation as measured by

the year-on-year change in the PPI, displayed

a relatively stable movement during 2017. The

producer price inflation in the Agriculture sub-sector

exhibited overall increasing trends during the year.

The producer price inflation in the Electricity and Water

Supply sector varied in the range of -1.8 per cent

and 2.8 per cent during the year. Meanwhile,

producer price inflation in the Manufacturing

sub-sector moved on a declining trend during 2017.

The overall producer price inflation largely followed

the movements of the producer price inflation

in the Agriculture sub-sector, a trend that was

also observed in consumer price inflation during

the period. However, the declining trend of the

Manufacturing sector prices, which comprise the

highest weight in the PPI, could have contributed to

ease the increase in overall producer price inflation.

GDP Deflator

With the upward price movements in all

three major sectors of the economy, the

GDP deflator, which measures the price

movements of all domestically produced

goods and services in the overall economy,

increased during 2017, compared to the

previous year. Prices of the Agriculture, Industry

and Services sectors increased by 15.9 per cent,

7.1 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, during

the year, compared to 3.3 per cent, 3.2 per cent

and 2.9 per cent in 2016. Accordingly, the overall

GDP deflator increased to 8.2 per cent in 2017

compared to the 4.1 per cent in 2016.

Inflation Expectations

Inflation expectations of the Corporate

sector were well aligned with actual inflation

while the gap between long term and short term

inflation expectations narrowed. Over time,

inflation expectations have closely responded to

monetary and fiscal policy measures, at times

with a lag. Further, the trend of Corporate sector

inflation expectations was observed to be in line

with actual inflation, reflected by both the NCPI

and CCPI. Reasons cited by respondents for

their expected level of inflation mainly comprised

supply side disruptions and their perception on

the strength of the domestic currency. Further,

Inflation expectations, which is generally defined as economic agents’ beliefs or perceptions about inflation in the future, have long been in the centre of attention for Central Banks across the world, when setting monetary policy aimed at achieving price stability. Academic literature also suggests that an institutional commitment to a nominal inflation target helps promote price stability (Mishkin, 2011). Further, inflation expectations influence wage and price setting behaviours at different horizons, thereby being an important determinant of actual inflation. A sustained rise in short term inflation expectations signal the medium term inflationary pressures in the economy, which is an important factor to consider in setting the monetary policy at appropriate levels, to maintain price stability (Patra and Ray, 2010). In the long-term, inflation expectations indicate the view of the public on the credibility of the Central Bank in maintaining stable inflation. Therefore, Central Banks, the inflation targeting ones in particular, pay special attention to inflation expectations, as the effectiveness of monetary policy and the credibility of the Central Banks in achieving price stability are likely to be greater in instances where the inflation expectations remain anchored closer to the inflation target (Bernanke, 2007). Accordingly, measuring inflation expectations becomes an important area with reference to the role of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in maintaining price stability, particularly with the gradual shifting of the Monetary Policy Framework towards Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT).

Inflation expectations, which are unobservable in real time, are measured using a range of methods, and are used as inputs for forecasting inflation and setting the future path of monetary policy. The two commonly used methods of measuring inflation expectations are survey-based and

BOX 03Measuring Inflation Expectations

market-implied measures (Adeney, Arsov and Evans, 2017)1. Survey based measures gauge people’s expectations of inflation by simply asking them what they expect inflation to be in the short, medium and long term. Generally, inflation expectations surveys consider three types of respondents: i.e., households, businesses and professionals. Frequency of surveys varies from monthly to semi-annually. Market-implied measures are derived from observed prices of certain financial instruments, with the payoffs linked closely to future expected inflation outcomes. The most often used market-implied measures are based on prices of index-linked financial securities.

In the context of Sri Lanka, the commencement of survey based measures of inflation expectations tracks far back to 2006. Since then, the survey has undergone several rounds of revamping to achieve a broader respondent base with improved quality and timeliness. The survey is broadly categorised among three respondent categories, which comprises the Corporate sector, Household sector and Academia. With regard to the Corporate sector, respondents provide their expected rate of inflation for the current month, three, six and twelve months ahead periods and the survey is conducted via e-mails. The sampling frame of the Corporate sector includes participants of the financial industry2, the listed companies of the Colombo Stock Exchange and the member companies of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. For the Household sector, where financial literacy and information availability is comparatively lower than that of the Corporate sector, group discussions are conducted with the employees3 of randomly selected public institutions in the Colombo district. To compensate for the information disadvantage, a brief introduction on inflation is provided before the survey and their perceived “range” of inflation for future periods is obtained. Further, the CBSL also commenced obtaining responses from Academia from mid-2017, where responses are obtained on the expected rate of inflation from lecturers in state universities. All three respondent categories are also requested to state the reasons for their stated inflation expectations, while the collected data are analysed using the median of inflation expectations.

As observed over the years, changes in the monetary and fiscal policies are reflected in respondents’ expected levels of inflation, however, at times with a lag. For example, respondents reacted to the tightening stance of monetary policy in the preceding periods by lowering or not increasing their expected inflation, as they believed the policy actions would curb excessive price pressure in the future. Similarly, when changes to the Government tax structure were introduced in May 2016, the change was mirrored in survey results, as respondents increased their expected inflation across all tenors surveyed.

It is also observed that the gap between near-term and long-term inflation expectations of the Corporate sector are being narrowed, thus indicating the expectation of less volatility in future inflation. During 2017, reasons

cited by the Corporate sector for their expected inflation mainly drifted among domestic supply side conditions and their perception on the strength of the domestic currency. Household sector expectations too, attune to changes in policy measures, although the magnitude of the expected inflation generally remains higher than that of the Corporate sector. Further, the recently commenced Inflation Expectations Survey (IES) for Academia also show outcomes more similar to the Corporate sector and are observed to be closely aligned with actual inflation.

Way Forward

Country experiences reveal the importance of having a national coverage in conducting the IES. However, a major limitation of the current IES conducted by the CBSL is the restrained geographical coverage. Therefore, the CBSL plans to expand the IES beyond the Colombo district through the newly established network of the Country-Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS)4, which closely follows the NCPI data collection layout. The CWDCS is featured with real-time data management via a system of Tablet computers together with a software application (App). Thus, conducting IES through this system is expected to improve the coverage and precision of the Household sector inflation expectations.

As observed over the years, higher inflation expectations of individuals in the Household sector could be attributable to limited knowledge in economics and poor financial literacy. In order to address this issue, the CBSL is in the process of introducing an Inflation Perception Survey (IPS) using the CWDCS network, which would seek qualitative responses from households on expected level of variation in consumer expenditure, including food and non-food categories, for three months and one year ahead periods. It is expected that the IPS would provide extra insights into inflation, while facilitating to obtain a more accurate read of households’ true inflation perceptions. These surveys could be improved frequently with periodic reviews, similar to India’s experience on the progression of the inflation perception and expectation surveys over time (Mohanty, 2012). Enhanced financial literacy would in turn improve the process of expectations formation of the public, which is vital for the effectiveness of monetary policy under the FIT regime.

also varied, attuning to increases in general price

levels, although they naturally remain at a level higher

than the expectations of the Corporate sector.

4.3 Wages

During 2017, wage rate indices indicated

signs of wage pressure in the economy, with

real wages being on a downward trend. This

was as a result of a slower increase in nominal

wages than the increase in inflation, and was

prominent in the public and formal private

sectors in 2017. However, the demand pressure

from wages on the general price level remained

subdued during the course of the year.

Public Sector Wages

The gross salary of public sector

employees remained unchanged in 2017,

even though the inclusion of the special

allowance and interim allowance to the basic

salary continued in 2017. Accordingly, the

nominal wages of public sector employees, as

measured by the annual average change in the

Public Sector Wage Rate Index (2012=100),

remained unchanged in 2017, compared to the

increase of 3.9 per cent recorded in the previous

year. Public sector employees experienced a

4.4 Population, Labour Force and Employment

Population

The mid-year population in 2017 was

estimated at 21.4 million, with an annual

growth rate of 1.1 per cent, unchanged from

the growth rate observed in 2016. This included

10.4 million males (48.4 per cent) and 11.1 million

females (51.6 per cent). Population with regard

to age categories below 15 years, 15-59 years,

and 60 years and above, represented shares of

25.2 per cent, 62.4 per cent and 12.4 per cent of

the total population, respectively, in 2017. The

real wage erosion of 7.2 per cent in 2017 as a

result of the developments in inflation, compared

to a marginal real wage erosion of 0.1 per cent

in 2016.

Private Sector Wages

Nominal wages of employees in the formal

private sector increased marginally in 2017.

It is measured in terms of the annual average

change in the minimum wage rate index of

employees whose wages are governed by the

Wages Boards Trades2 (1978=100), which is

compiled by the Department of Labour. However,

real wages of employees in the formal private

sector declined by 5.9 per cent during 2017,

compared to the decline of 3.6 per cent in 2016.

A growth in both nominal and real wages

was observed in the informal private sector

in 2017, where wages are determined based

on market conditions. Accordingly, nominal

wages of informal private sector employees,

as measured by the annual average change in

the Informal Private Sector Wage Rate Index

(2012=100), increased by 9.5 per cent in 2017,

compared to the increase of 7.9 per cent in the

previous year. Nominal wage rate indices of all

three sub sectors, namely; Agriculture, Industry

and Services increased by 10.3 per cent,

10.2 per cent and 8.5 per cent, respectively, in

2017. Increases of wages, in nominal terms, in

Masonry and Carpentry trades by 12.5 per cent

and 11.2 per cent, respectively, were observed in

2017 owing to the increased demand for labour

in these sectors, with the rapid expansion of the

Construction sector. Real wage growth of the

employees in the informal private sector was

1.7 per cent in 2017, compared to 3.7 per cent

recorded in 2016.

2 Minimum wages of 21 Wages Boards are considered when compiling the nominal index and the real index of the same is calculated by the CBSL.

population density3 continued to increase from

338 in 2016 to 342 in 2017, as observed in all

districts. The Western province, which is the leading

contributor to GDP, accounted for 28.4 per cent

of the total mid-year population, while Central,

Southern and North-Western provinces contributed

to the population by 12.7 per cent, 12.2 per cent

and 11.7 per cent, respectively, in 2017.

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a

phenomenon of ageing population, with

persons aged 60 years and above representing

a share of 12.4 per cent4, compared to

6.6 per cent in 1981. This is also supported by

the increase in the median age of the population

from 21 years to 30 years5 and the increase of

elderly dependency ratio6 from 12 per cent to

20 per cent during the same period. Reasons for

such a scenario range from low levels of population

growth to relatively high levels of life expectancy.

Since such demographic trends pose serious

challenges to the economy in the guise of reduced

labour force participation, increased dependency

ratio, low productivity, lower savings rates and

increased public expenditure on social welfare,

significant policy actions are needed to address the

same. Thus, policies could be directed towards

engaging the elderly population on productive

activities through upskilling initiatives, educating

them on retirement planning, encouraging their

participation in contributory superannuation

schemes and development of workforce skills

for the geriatric care sector to reduce possible

socio-economic vulnerabilities.

Labour Force

Continuing the trend observed in the past

five years, the labour force grew by 3.1 per cent

in 2017, compared to 2016. The labour force,

which is defined as the economically active

population7 aged 15 years and above, was

8.567 million in 2017, compared to 8.311 million in

2016. Encouragingly, with the growth of the labour

force, the employed population also increased by

3.3 per cent, amidst a decline in the unemployed

population, indicating an increase in employment

opportunities in the economy. However, this

notable increase in the labour force was able

to trigger only a marginal improvement in the

Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR)8 due to

the expansion in household population, which

includes both economically active and inactive

persons. Thus, the LFPR improved moderately to

54.1 per cent in 2017, from 53.8 per cent in 2016.

The gender gap in labour force participation

narrowed during 2017, although the LFPR still

remains much in favour of the male labour

force. The male LFPR was 74.5 per cent during

2017 while the female LFPR was 36.6 per cent.

As such, females remain under-represented in

the Sri Lankan labour force, despite increasing

number of women attaining educational and

professional qualifications. The main reason for

economic inactivity in females, as identified by

the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of the DCS,

is their engagement in housework. Further, the

Doing Business Index database on labour market

regulation9 reflects that Sri Lanka lags in terms of

provisions for night work and maternity leave, when

compared with economies such as Singapore,

China, India, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

Therefore, as highlighted in several previous

occasions, a national level policy intervention is

required to create sufficiently conducive working

conditions for females. Such facilities could include

affordable child care and aged care, flexible and

part-time working arrangements and improved

transportation facilities. “Vision 2025”, the

Government’s Economic Policy, which outlines its

future path, has also identified several remedies to

address the issue of low female LFPR and robust

implementation of these measures would be of vital

importance to achieve the desired economic vision.

Increasing the female labour force participation will

not only increase the supply of labour as a factor

of production, but also will enhance the ability to

create value in the labour force through new skills

and talent brought in by gender diversity.

Employment

The number of employed persons increased

in 2017 amidst structural shifts in employment

in the economy. As such, the number employed

increased by 3.3 per cent to 8.208 million in 2017,

compared to 7.948 million in the previous year.

The Services sector continued to be the foremost

employment generating sector in the economy,

contributing a share of 45.5 per cent of the total

employment in 2017. Within the Services sector, the

highest share of employment was recorded in the

wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicle

and motor cycles sub-sector with a representation

of 14.1 per cent of total employment. The Industry

sector share of total employment in 2017 was

28.4 per cent. The Manufacturing sub sector

accounted for the largest share of employment

within the Industry sector, with a representation of

19.3 per cent of total employment. However,

employment in the Agriculture sector declined

owing to the contraction observed in agricultural

activities, due to continued disruptions caused by

adverse weather conditions that prevailed during

the period. Accordingly, the share of employed

population in the Agriculture sector decreased to

26.1 per cent in 2017, from 27.1 per cent in 2016.

During the course of 2017, the share of employed

population in the Agriculture sector reached an

all-time low in the third quarter of 2017, reflected by

the negative growth in agricultural activities during

the same period.

In terms of the absolute number of

employment opportunities created, a significant

increase was observed in Private sector

employment, amidst an increase across all

categories during 2017. Accordingly, the number

employed in the Private sector, which represented

a share of 43.3 per cent of total employment in

2017, increased by 117,405 persons. Further, the

Unemployment among youth, educationally

qualified and females continued to remain

high despite the low overall unemployment

rate. The highest unemployment rate by the

level of education continued to be observed in

the GCE (A/L) and above category, which was

8.1 per cent in 2017. The youth (15-24 years)

unemployment rate decreased to 18.6 per cent in

2017, compared to 21.6 per cent in the previous

year. Unemployment among persons above

30 years remained low and can be attributable

to increased employability with higher work

experience and skills developed over the period.

Factors underlying high unemployment among

youth and educationally qualified could be due

to the limited creation of skilled jobs as well as

inadequate supply of labour to match labour

market requirements. Sri Lanka’s education,

vocational and technical training systems have

historically underperformed in terms of generating

skills demanded by respective sectors of the

economy, despite the education system being

able to provide free education to mass public

equitably from primary schools to universities.

Thus, it is urgent that formal education and

vocational training are aligned to match labour

market requirements. Rigid mandates that are

enforced upon education and training systems/

organisations with common objectives need to be

relaxed to supply adequate labour to the domestic

labour market with relevant skills. In addition,

private and public sector industry participants

should co-operate to identify labour demanding

sectors and to assess labour availability. In such

an environment, the conventional teaching and

training methods would need to be challenged,

and would require institutions and trainees to be

adoptable to changing dynamics.

A large gap has been created between

the requirements of job creators and the

expectations of job seekers, leading to labour

shortages in the domestic market. This is

also revealed by the findings of the Business

Sentiment surveys, where the intention to hire

labour has been largely positive, although labour

availability is lagging. Further, as per the Labour

Demand Survey conducted by the DCS in 2017,

main reasons for difficulty in filling approximately

0.5 million vacancies that existed as at June

2017 were, the unavailability of people interested

in doing certain jobs, high competition from

other employers, demand for high salaries and

unavailability of qualified applicants, which are

results of long prevailing skill gaps in the country.

If the issue of labour shortage is not addressed

immediately, sectors with persistent skill gaps

and labour scarcity would continue to demand

the government to provide clearance to import

labour. In terms of policy measures to address

labour shortage, occupation accreditation can be

introduced to attract job seekers towards certain

types of jobs that are not socially recognised.

Further, actions could be taken to introduce and

implement reforms in the areas of archaic labour

laws, representation of youth in labour advisory

councils, demand driven training in collaboration

with the private sector, up skilling and reskilling of

the current labour force, and certification based

on learning or prior experience. Since the human

capital is identified as one of Sri Lanka’s key

strengths, its capacity should be further improved

to attain optimal utilisation of the domestic

workforce and the untapped potential of the rural

youth, in order to achieve the desired growth

momentum of the economy.

Foreign Employment

The total number of departures for foreign

employment in 2017 declined by 12.6 per cent

compared to 2016. The continuous decline in

2014 can be mainly attributable to the policy actions

taken by the government to minimise the departures

of unskilled labour, particularly in the housemaid

category. The lower demand and government

policies on migrant workers in destination markets,

particularly in the Middle-East, also had a significant

impact on the drop in the departures for foreign

employment. The increased demand for labour in

various sectors within the country could also be a

reason for this observed drop. Accordingly, the

total number of departures for foreign employment

was 212,162 in 2017, compared to 242,816 in

2016. The female departures declined by 11.7 per

cent to 72,891 and male departures declined by

13.1 per cent to 139,271 in 2017, compared to 2016.

The female representation is around 34 per cent of

the total departures for foreign employment, which

is far below the housemaid centered 53 per cent

representation a decade ago.

In terms of skill levels, departures for

foreign employment have declined across all

categories. Despite the steps taken as per the

strategic direction of the authorities towards “Safe,

Skilled Migration”, the unskilled and housemaid

categories still account for around 55 per cent of total

departures. Only 3 per cent of worker departures

were under the professional category and

3.4 per cent of worker departures were under

the middle level category. It is noteworthy that

departures for professional and middle level

categories showed a decline in 2017, compared

to 2016 despite the increasing demand for

professionals and skilled employees in many

countries including the Gulf economies, which

are highly focused on creating knowledge-based

economies at present. Despite the authorities’

continuous efforts to channel job placements

through registered agencies, around 68 per cent

of the migrant workers have used private sources

to access foreign labour markets. This could result

in vulnerability in foreign employment due to lack

of protection over employment rights and other

social hazards abroad. Sri Lankans have obtained

employment opportunities across 108 countries in

2017 and almost 90 per cent are employed in the

Middle East, which continued to be the dominant

migrant destination. In June 2017, several countries

such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,

Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with

Qatar, which annually hosts around a quarter of

Sri Lankan job seekers. Accordingly, the migrant

worker departures to Qatar declined to 56,644 in

2017, compared to 59,523 in 2016.

Dependence of the Sri Lankan economy

on worker remittances needs to be reduced.

youth unemployment have led several Middle

Eastern countries to implement national policies

to create jobs for the locals and restrict migrant

labour. Such scenarios raise significant threats

to the ability of Sri Lankan migrant workers in

securing jobs in these markets. In addition,

increasing demand for skilled labour and large

scale investment on technology to reduce the

labour cost could limit the number of foreign job

opportunities available for Sri Lankans in the

near future. Hence, it is important that vocational

and professional training systems match the

international standards so that employment

opportunities in higher skilled categories in

existing markets and new markets in developed

countries can be secured. Meanwhile, a

substantial portion of the unskilled and middle

level foreign job seekers could be channeled

towards local industries, which are facing

severe labour shortages despite comparably

higher wages. In the overall context, long term

measures should be brought in to ease the

over-dependency on worker-remittances by

gradually improving export capacity and Foreign

Direct Investments.

The Sri Lankan Bureau of Foreign

Employment (SLBFE) continued various

programmes to regulate the labour migration

process while empowering migrant workers

and their families. Ensuring trustworthy foreign

employment for Sri Lankan migrant workers, the

SLBFE conducted 224 raids on illegal recruitment

activities during the year 2017, which is an

increase of 27 per cent compared to 2016. The

SLBFE also filed 239 court cases against illegal

agencies and licensed agencies that violated the

law during 2017, using its mandate to regulate

the industry. As a welfare measure on the safety

of migrant workers, the SLBFE paid a total of

Rs. 139.2 million to an insurance scheme that

covered 212,470 migrant workers during 2017.

A total of 1,966 migrant workers were repatriated

due to problems encountered in host countries,

utilising Rs. 78.8 million of the insurance scheme

and Workers’ Welfare Fund, during 2017. With the

view of facilitating the island wide migrant workers’

network, measures are being taken to establish

Migrant Resource Centers in provinces with a high

outflow of migrant workers.

Labour Relations and Labour Market Reforms

Labour relations in the private sector

improved during 2017 as reflected by the

decline in the number of strikes, the total

number of workers involved and man days

lost. Accordingly, a total of 10,312 workers were

involved in 32 strikes and 58,279 man days were

lost due to strikes during 2017. This was mainly

contributed by sectors other than plantation in

2017. However, these data indicate only the strikes

of the private industries that are reported to the

Labour Department. Apart from the reported strikes,

publicly available data revealed a number of strikes

(16 strikes during 2017) in sectors such as health,

education, petroleum, postal and transportation,

which could have had a significant negative impact

on the daily lives of the general public and the

social and economic activities of the country.

The Ministry of Labour and Trade Union

Relations adopted several measures to

improve workplace cooperation and industrial

harmony in 2017, with a view of establishing

a better working environment in the private

sector. The National Policy on the Elimination

of Child Labour in Sri Lanka was launched on

08 September 2017 with the objective of ending

Child Labour in the country. In addition, decisions

were also taken through the consultation of the

National Labour Council to extend maternity benefits

from third and subsequent children for female

workers in the private sector and to implement

administrative relaxation to spread over of working

hours in a five day work week in the private sector

manufacturing industry. Further, steps have been

taken to increase the minimum age for employment

from 14 years to 16 years, by amending the

relevant labour related legislations in line with the

regulation to increase compulsory education up to

16 years. Awareness programmes and workshops

were conducted targeting the managers, key staff

members and employees of selected enterprises

in the private sector for promoting the social

dialogue to develop and strengthen industrial

harmony at workplaces. Selected enterprises were

awarded in 2017, recognising their commitment

in strengthening social dialog and workplace

cooperation.

Labour Productivity

Labour productivity, as measured by Gross

Value Added (GVA) (in 2010 prices) per hour

worked, decreased marginally in 2017. Accordingly,

overall productivity decreased by 1.14 per cent

to Rs. 458.29 per hour in the first three quarters of

2017, from Rs. 463.56 per hour in the corresponding

period of 2016. The level of labour productivity in the

Agriculture sector continues to remain the lowest

of all three sectors, at Rs. 165.77 per hour worked.

Despite the Agriculture sector contributing to a share

of only around 7 per cent of the national output,

approximately 26 per cent of workers in the country

are employed in the sector. Meanwhile, productivity

of Industry and Services sectors was recorded as

Rs. 479.42 and Rs. 564.62, respectively, for the first

three quarters of 2017.

Amidst structural shifts in employment

observed in the recent past, focus should be

on improving productivity of all sectors of the

economy. Productivity levels of the Agriculture

sector could be improved through various actions

such as the adoption of technology in commercial

agricultural activities and the use of high yielding

varieties and hybrid seeds. Further, with the entry

into new trade agreements and restoration of

certain trade facilities, the Industry and Services

sectors could focus on higher value addition

through diversifying into niche markets and offering

value added products to international consumers.

Apart from the low value addition in the Agriculture

sector, the higher share of employed population in

the sector has also been identified as a main reason

for the lower productivity in the sector. Thus, there

is a high potential to bring rural youth engaged

in agricultural activities into higher value adding

sectors through vocational training if authorities

outreach for the untapped potential. Moreover,

nation-wide awareness to attract the rural youth for

such training programmes would then be required,

where youth attitudes are aligned with the broader

economic agenda of creating a competitive,

knowledge based economy.
