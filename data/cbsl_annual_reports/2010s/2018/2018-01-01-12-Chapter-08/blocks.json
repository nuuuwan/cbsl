In the aftermath to the crisis, various expert groups reviewed this issue and it was highlighted that forward looking provisioning requirements are needed. Further, the need for a more logical approach towards classification and measurement of financial instruments was also highlighted, which ultimately led the standard setters to move towards International Financial Reporting Standard 9: Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), in order to ensure more proactive recognition of losses and better risk management.",
