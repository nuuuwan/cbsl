8.1 OverviewF

inancial sector showed improved

performance as the supportive prudential

measures continued to preserve stability

of the financial system in 2017. The improved

performance of the financial sector was broad-

based and mainly contributed by the banks, other

deposit taking financial institutions and contractual

savings institutions.

The banking sector continued to expand

with improved business operations and risk

management practices with the implementation of

timely and appropriate regulatory measures during

the year. Asset growth of the banking sector,

remained high though it gradually moderated

during the second half of the year responding to

the tight monetary policy stance and the resultant

high market interest rates. Further, the quality of

the banking sector assets improved as reflected

in the decline in Non-Performing Loans (NPL)

ratios. Capital adequacy ratios and liquidity ratios

of the sector remained at healthy levels. The sector

resilience was improved by the notable decline in

borrowing during the period as deposits sourced

the funds for banking sector expansion. Banking

sector profitability also improved as reflected in

both the Return on Assets (ROA) and the Return

on Equity (ROE) ratios, indicating the build-up of

resources to mitigate potential risks in the system.

Overall, the banking sector continued to support

economic growth and development through

enhanced banking services and outreach, along

with branch network expansion, thereby, improving

financial inclusion in the country.

The Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) and

Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs) sector

performance moderated during the year with low

credit growth, declining profitability and increase in

non-performing loans. The slowdown in the sector

was mainly due to fiscal and macroprudential

policy measures taken to curtail importation of

motor vehicles, moderate economic growth and

natural calamities such as floods and drought

conditions that prevailed in 2017. Nevertheless, the

key performance indicators of the sector, including

capital, liquidity and profitability, continued to be

positive. The Central Bank initiated key prudential

measures with much consideration on reviving

the companies with weak financial positions.

Necessary actions have been taken to cease or

limit finance business operations of weak finance

companies to safeguard depositors and the long

term stability of the financial sector. Healthy

growth was recorded by the contractual savings

institutions, dominated by the Employees’ Provident

Fund (EPF) and the Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF),

providing reasonable returns for their members.

Other sub sectors of the financial sector, which

include the insurance sector, the primary dealers

in government securities and the unit trust sector,

recorded positive business performance during the

period, without major stability concerns.

Financial markets remained volatile during

2017, in line with the changing local and global

economic environment. Excess rupee liquidity in

the money market, which declined gradually during

the first half of the year, increased to a high level

during the second half of the year. The undue

pressure on short-term interest rates emanating

from volatile liquidity conditions was addressed

through active open market operations (OMO) by

the Central Bank. The Sri Lankan rupee continued

to depreciate gradually against the US dollar during

the year, in an environment of allowing greater

flexibility in exchange. Unwinding of the foreign

investments in government securities market,

with the expectations of an interest rate hike by

the Federal Reserve Bank exerted pressure on

the Sri Lankan rupee to depreciate in early 2017.

However, this trend was reversed during the second

half of the year with increased foreign investments

in government securities, capital market and the

receipt of tranche of the Extended Fund Facility

(EFF) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

to Sri Lanka. Payments and settlements systems

operated efficiently and smoothly while focusing on

improving the convenience and safety of payments

in order to facilitate the economic activities of

the country effectively. The Central Bank, being

the regulator of the national payment system,

broadened the regulatory and supervisory activities

during the year with the objective of ensuring the

stability and soundness of the financial system to

mitigate the risks associated with payment and

settlement systems.

The regulatory framework governing the

financial system was further strengthened during

the year introducing prudential measures with a

view to enhancing the safety and resilience of the

financial sector in Sri Lanka. Prudential measures

were mainly focused on enhancing transparency,

capital requirements, access to finance, liquidity

and risk management frameworks. In addition,

the Central Bank established the Resolution and

Enforcement Department to expedite resolution of

weak financial institutions, without having to affect

the stability of the financial system.

8.2 Performance of the Banking Sector

The banking sector continued to dominate

the financial sector, accounting for 60.3 per cent

of the total assets of the financial sector and its

performance remained robust during 2017. The

implementation of timely and appropriate regulatory

actions and adoption of enhanced risk management

measures helped the sector to maintain risks

(credit, market, liquidity, operational and others)

at manageable levels. Further, as a result of such

prudential measures, undue concentration of loans

was addressed, while operational performance and

the resilience of the sector were further improved.

Asset growth, which picked up during the first half

of the year, gradually moderated during the second

half of the year, following the adoption of targeted

policy actions. Improvements in asset quality

were seen in the decline in NPL ratios. Banking

sector profits in 2017 improved compared to the

previous year as reflected in the improvement in

both the Return on Assets (ROA) and the Return

on Equity (ROE) ratios. Overall, the banking sector

operated with sufficient capital and liquidity buffers

throughout the year.

Business Growth

(a) Outreach: The banking sector consisted of

25 Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), including

12 branches of foreign banks, and 7 Licensed

Specialised Banks (LSBs) by end 2017. The banking

sector continued to support economic growth and

development by the enhanced banking services

and the expansion of the banking network, thereby,

promoting financial inclusion in the country. In

2017, several banks introduced technology based

products/services to facilitate financial inclusion.

Further, 43 new banking outlets (excluding student

savings units) and 684 new Automated Teller

Machines (ATMs) were established raising the

number of banking outlets to 6,227 and ATMs to

4,416, at the end of 2017.

(b) Assets: The banking sector asset base

surpassed Rs. 10 trillion by end 2017, with

year-on-year growth reaching 13.8 per cent by

end 2017 from 12.0 per cent by end 2016. Growth

in assets, which slowed down in 2016, picked up

during the first half of 2017 but moderated during

the last quarter of 2017. The growth in assets was

mainly due to the increase in loans and advances,

which accounted for 62.5 per cent of the total

assets by end 2017. The impact of the tightening of

monetary policy in March 2017 was reflected in the

moderation of credit growth during the latter part of

the year. Banking sector credit reported a steady

growth during the first half of the year, reaching

20.1 per cent as at end June 2017, from 17.5 per

cent as at end 2016, moderated to 16.1 per cent by

end 2017. Loans and advances were extended to

all major sectors of the economy during 2017. The

increase in lending was reflected primarily in the

lending to manufacturing (21.9 per cent), trading

(19.8 per cent), construction (19.5 per cent) and

consumption and other (15.8 per cent) sectors. In

terms of products, term loans and overdrafts grew

by 16.5 per cent and 21.2 per cent, respectively,

and mainly contributed to the increase in total

credit, accounting for 58.4 per cent and 17.3 per

cent, respectively. Credit by way of pawning

advances grew by 15.2 per cent in 2017, from a

deceleration of 2.4 per cent in 2016. Leasing,

which reported the highest growth rate of 52.9 per

cent at end 2015, declined to 3.3 per cent at end

2016 due to the introduction of the Loan-to-Value

(LTV) ratio in January 2016, grew by 5.8 per cent,

in 2017. Growth in investments by 12.5 per cent in

2017, compared to a deceleration of 3.3 per cent in

2016, also contributed to the growth in total assets

during the year. Investments in Treasury bills

Held-to-maturity (HTM) and in the trading

books increased by Rs. 91 billion and Rs. 122

billion, respectively. Meanwhile, investments in

Treasury bonds in the HTM portfolio increased by

Rs. 16 billion, despite a decline in Treasury bonds

in the trading portfolio of Rs. 9 billion during 2017.

Investments in Sri Lanka Development Bonds

(SLDBs) increased by Rs. 67 billion during the year

under review. Cash and due from banks increased

marginally by Rs. 35 billion (3.5 per cent) during

the year.

(c) Liabilities: The liability base of the banking

sector, which mainly comprised deposits and

borrowings, accounted for 71.9 per cent and 15.6

per cent, respectively, of the total banking sector

funds at end 2017. Customer deposits, which

recorded improved growth during the first half of

the year, from 16.5 per cent at end 2016 to 20.6

per cent at end June 2017, grew at 17.5 per cent

at end 2017, on year-on-year basis. During 2017,

the share of term deposits increased to 63.6 per

cent, while the share of savings deposits declined

to 27.5 per cent of total deposits at end of 2017 from

60.6 per cent and 29.5 per cent, respectively, of

the total deposits at the end of 2016. However, the

year-on-year growth of term deposits marginally

declined to 23.4 per cent as at end 2017, from

23.8 per cent as at the end 2016, while the growth

in savings deposits increased to 9.4 per cent as

at end 2017 from 7.4 per cent as at end 2016.

and Savings Account (CASA) ratio decreased

to 33.2 per cent by end 2017, from 37.1 per cent

at end 2016. Total rupee borrowings decreased

by Rs. 66 billion (9.9 per cent), while borrowings

denominated in foreign currency decreased by

US dollars 290.7 million (4.2 per cent), resulting

in an overall contraction of total borrowings to

Rs. 1,607 billion (5.3 per cent) at end 2017

(d) Off-balance sheet exposure: Resulting

from the lower foreign exchange forward

transactions, the year-on-year growth of the

off-balance sheet exposures of the banking sector

declined by 5.6 per cent to Rs. 3,874 billion as

at end 2017, from 9.1 per cent as at end 2016.

Undrawn credit lines accounted for the largest

share of off-balance sheet exposure as at end

2017 with a contribution of 28.5 per cent. Exposure

of foreign exchange (FX) purchases (17.9 per

cent) and sales (13.8 per cent) together accounted

for 31.7 per cent, while guarantees and bonds,

documentary credit, acceptances and derivatives

comprised the remaining share of off-balance sheet

exposures. Except for foreign currency exposures

and derivatives, which declined by Rs. 32 billion

(2.6 per cent) and Rs. 87 billion (48.6 per cent),

respectively, all other off- balance sheet exposures

reported increases during 2017.

Risks in the Banking Sector

(a) Credit Risk: During the year, the credit

quality of the banking sector improved marginally,

as reflected by the decline in the gross NPL ratio

to 2.5 per cent as at end 2017, from 2.6 per cent

as at end 2016, despite an increase in NPLs of

Rs. 18.3 billion during 2017. Total provisions for

loan losses increased by Rs. 10 billion during 2017,

of which 55.3 per cent was due to an increase in

specific provisions. Due to the increase in NPLs in

volume terms, specific and total provision coverage

ratios declined to 49.6 per cent and 69.9 per cent,

respectively, as at end 2017, from 52.1 per cent

and 71.8 per cent, respectively, as at end 2016.

The banking sector credit portfolio was

distributed among diverse economic sectors in the

economy. Five major sectors namely, consumption

and other (20.7 per cent), construction (18.4 per

cent), trading (14.5 per cent), manufacturing

(11.2 per cent), and agriculture and fishing sectors

(8.6 per cent), accounted for more than 70 per cent

of the total credit portfolio, at end 2017.

(b) Market Risk:

Interest Rates: The banking sector reported

a net capital gain of Rs. 4.8 billion on investment

in Treasury bonds, due to the decline of Treasury

bond yield rates during the second half of the

year. The cumulative interest rate sensitive gap of

the banking sector, i.e. the gap between the rate

sensitive assets and the rate sensitive liabilities,

as a percentage of the rate sensitive assets up to

12 months’ time bucket, widened to a negative

34.1 per cent as at end 2017, compared to a

negative 30.7 per cent as at end 2016, largely due

to a higher increase in deposits with maturities less

than one year.

Prices of Equity: The banking sector continued

to operate with minimal exposure to equity risk

as the total investments in listed shares was

Rs. 26 billion, which was only 1.0 per cent of the

total investments and 0.2 per cent of the total

assets of the banking sector as at end 2017.

Exchange Rates: The foreign currency risk

of the banking sector increased during the year

mainly due to an increase in investments in

securities denominated in foreign currency. The

Domestic Banking Units (DBUs) of the banking

sector reported a long foreign currency exposure

of Rs. 21 billion as at end 2017, compared to

Rs. 16 billion as at end 2016. The foreign currency

exposure of the DBUs of the banking sector as a

percentage of the banks’ regulatory capital and

on balance sheet assets stood at 2.3 per cent and

0.2 per cent, respectively, at end 2017. The banking

sector reported a net foreign currency revaluation

gain of Rs. 8.6 billion during 2017.

(c) Liquidity Risk: The banking sector

operated with a high level of liquidity during 2017.

The Statutory Liquid Assets Ratio (SLAR) of DBUs,

which was maintained well above the regulatory

minimum of 20.0 per cent, increased to 31.3 per

cent as at end 2017, from 29.9 per cent in 2016.

Meanwhile SLAR of Off-shore Banking Units

(OBUs) was 34.6 per cent. Infusion of capital into

a few banks and the deceleration of credit growth

mainly contributed to the increase in liquidity in

the banking sector. Further, the credit to deposits

and borrowings ratio increased by 208 basis points

during the year. Liquid assets to total assets and

liquid assets to total deposits increased by 130

basis points and 56 basis points during 2017.

Total liquid assets of the sector increased by

Rs. 474 billion (19.2 per cent) to Rs. 2,939 billion

by end 2017. Government securities accounted

for 88.1 per cent of the increase in liquid assets

during 2017 and accounted for 75.5 per cent of the

total liquid assets as at end 2017.

The cumulative maturity gap as a percentage

of cumulative liabilities of the banking sector

widened for the maturity time period (bucket) less

than 30 days by end 2017, compared to end 2016.

Variations in other maturity buckets were marginal.

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of the

banking industry was maintained well above the

regulatory limit of 80 per cent as at end 2017 (Banks

are required to maintain 90 per cent with effect from

01 January 2018 and 100 per cent with effect from

01 January 2019). LCR for All Currency Liquidity

Requirement increased to 155.6 per cent as at end

2017 from 152.6 per cent as at end 2016, while

LCR for Rupee Liquidity Requirement declined to

187.1 per cent from 200.8 per cent.

Resources

(a) Profitability: Higher growth in interest

expenses (39.1 per cent) compared to the growth

in interest income (28.3 per cent) resulted in a

marginal decline in the net interest margin to

3.5 per cent during 2017, from 3.6 per cent during

2016. Non-interest income, however, increased

by Rs. 19 billion during 2017, compared to 2016,

despite a decline in foreign exchange income by

Rs. 2 billion. Non-interest expenses increased

by Rs. 7 billion compared to last year, with staff

costs contributing 62.6 per cent to the increase.

Loan loss provisions rose by Rs. 9 billion to

Rs. 19.8 billion in 2017 compared to last year's

Rs. 10.5 billion mainly due to classifying of

non-performing loans to loss category.

Profit after tax of the banking sector grew by

19.2 per cent, from Rs. 116.5 billion in 2016 to

Rs. 139 billion in 2017. The increase in profitability

was reflected in the increase in the ROE ratio by

28 basis points to 17.6 per cent and ROA - before

tax ratio by 6 basis points to 1.4 per cent. The cost

to income ratio has deteriorated to 76.3 per cent in

2017, from 75.6 per cent in 2016, largely due to the

(b) Capital: The Basel III capital standards were

introduced to the banking sector from 01 July 2017

and the banking sector has maintained capital

ratios at a comfortable level under Basel III in order

to absorb any adverse shocks. The Core Capital

Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and total CAR as at end

December 2017, subsequent to the inclusion of

estimated audited profits for 2017, stood at 12.4 per

cent and 15.2 per cent, respectively. The infusion

of capital to meet the increased minimum capital

requirements largely contributed to the increase in

Tier I capital and the share of Tier 1 capital to total

capital increased to 81.1 per cent as at end 2017,

from 80.5 per cent as at end 2016. Tier II capital of

the banking sector largely comprised subordinated

term debt, which accounted for 77.0 per cent of the

Tier II capital as at end 2017. The banking sector

capital levels are expected to improve further with

improved retained earnings and infusion of fresh

capital to meet the increased capital requirements

under Basel III and the enhanced minimum capital

requirements by end 2020.

Risk weighted assets of the banking sector

increased by 13.0 per cent during 2017, compared

to 17.9 per cent growth during 2016, mainly due to

the moderation in credit growth. The share of credit

risk weighted assets in total risk weighted assets

increased to 88.7 per cent by end 2017, from

86.6 per cent by end 2016.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

1. Background

1.1 Introduction of Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standard 9 in Sri Lanka

During the period of the global financial crisis, there was a perception that accounting rules under International Accounting Standard 39: Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement have contributed to worsen the economic crisis, through the use of fair value as a basis for accounting of financial instruments, which resulted in delayed recognition of loan losses. In the aftermath to the crisis, various expert groups reviewed this issue and it was highlighted that forward looking provisioning requirements are needed. Further, the need for a more logical approach towards classification and measurement of financial instruments was also highlighted, which ultimately led the standard setters to move towards International Financial Reporting Standard 9: Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), in order to ensure more proactive recognition of losses and better risk management.

Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standard 9: Financial Instruments (SLFRS 9), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL), is effective for the annual financial reporting periods beginning on or after 01 January 2018 and is mandatory for adoption by all entities. However, ICASL has granted the option to prepare the interim quarterly financial statements under the previous Sri Lanka Accounting Standard (LKAS) 39: Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement, for the first three quarters of the first financial year under SLFRS 9.

The new standard establishes principles for reporting of financial instruments including requirements for classification, measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting. This is the corresponding Accounting Standard for IFRS 9, which was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board in July 2014, to be effective from 01 January 2018.

1.2 Major Changes Brought About by SLFRS 9

In line with global developments, SLFRS 9 introduced a forward-looking loan loss provisioning mechanism, replacing the previous incurred loss model under LKAS 39. This forward-looking provisioning mechanism requires entities to identify significant drivers of their business model and possible futuristic macroeconomic scenarios in order to accurately capture the expected credit loss going forward. Further, SLFRS 9 introduced a new basis for financial asset classification and a model for hedge accounting that aligns the accounting process with the risk management activities.

BOX 09Adoption of SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments by Banks in Sri Lanka

2. Classification of Financial Instruments under SLFRS 9

2.1 Classification of Financial Assets

Previously under LKAS 39, financial assets were classified into four categories, namely, Held-to-maturity (HTM), Loans and Receivables, Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), and available for sale. These are replaced in SLFRS 9 with two main categories, reflecting the measurement of Financial Instruments, namely amortized cost and fair value. The measure of fair value will have two sub categories, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income and FVTPL.

Financial asset classification under SLFRS 9 for debt securities is driven by the business model for managing financial assets and assets’ contractual cash flow characteristics, and disallows the ability of the entities to classify and measure financial instruments at their discretion. Under SLFRS 9, investments in equity instruments are to be measured at fair value and under LKAS 39 there was no such restriction for classification and measurement of equity instruments.

2.2 Classification of Financial Liabilities

The classification and measurement of financial liabilities under SLFRS 9 is the same as in LKAS 39, except in circumstances where an entity has chosen to measure a financial liability at FVTPL. In such cases, changes in fair value related to changes in own credit risk are adjusted separately to Other Comprehensive Income.

3. Credit Loss Provisioning / Impairment under SLFRS 9

3.1 Provisioning under LKAS 39 and SLFRS 9

The accounting model for recognising credit losses under LKAS 39, commonly referred to as "incurred loss model", requires recording of credit losses that have been incurred as of reporting date, rather than of probable future losses. In contrast, SLFRS 9 requires banks to provide for loan losses based on the expected credit loss approach, in order to facilitate timely recognition of credit losses. The new standard requires banks to calculate 12-months expected credit losses and life time expected losses for performing and under-performing/non-performing assets, respectively.

3.2 Three Stage Provisioning Model under SLFRS 9

SLFRS 9 outlines a ‘Three-Stage’ model for provisioning based on changes in credit quality (Figure 01). At the initial recognition, performing credit facilities are

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

2548

categorised into stage 1 and entities need to provide for expected credit losses for the next 12-months. Credit facilities are categorised as under-performing (stage 2) or non-performing (stage 3) when the credit risk is assumed to be increased significantly since the initial recognition and hence, lifetime expected losses must be recognised.

Figure 1:Stages of Recognising Credit Loss under SLFRS 9

Stage 1Performing(Initialrecogntion)

12-monthexpectedcredit losses

Lifetimeexpectedcredit losses

Lifeimeexpectedcredit losses

Stage 2Underperforming

Stage 3Nonperforming

Further, banks need to account for the interest revenue depending on the performing status. If the asset is performing or under-performing, interest revenue should be calculated based on the full value of the asset and if the asset is non-performing, interest revenue must be calculated based on the value after deducting the expected credit loss from the asset.

3.3 Use of Models, Parameters and Judgements

With the adoption of SLFRS 9, role of risk models and transparency of the such models are expected to be more significant. In order to measure the expected credit loss accurately, banks’ experience in assessing significant increase in credit risk, supported by reliable and justifiable forward-looking information is essential.

With the increased dependency on models, banks need to have in place validation processes to ensure that the credit risk assessment and measurement models are able to generate accurate, consistent and unbiased estimates on an on-going basis.

4. Global Regulatory Practices

4.1 Adoption of IFRS 9 in other Countries

Many countries across the globe have used various approaches on the adoptation of IFRS 9, under the guidance of relevant accounting regulatory bodies. However, due to the significant impact of IFRS 9 on the financial sector, arising from the increase in loan loss provisions through the use of expected credit loss approach, the Central Banks and other prudential regulatory authorities of some countries have already

issued guidance to banks to ensure smooth and consistent application of the Standard across the financial sector.

Regulatory treatment of provisions under the Standardised Approach1 and Internal Rating Based approaches2 for credit risk differs under Basel II/III and most countries who have already issued guidance on IFRS 9 are countries that have moved to advance approaches for credit risk. Countries using the Standardised Approach, like Sri Lanka, will find it challenging as there will be heavy dependence on complex credit provisioning models under IFRS 9.

4.2 Treatment of Accounting Provisions for Regulatory Capital Calculations

When moving towards a forward-looking loan loss provisioning mechanism, banks will need to recognise the impact of expected credit loss on the existing portfolios of loans and financial instruments to retained earnings, on the first day of adopting SLFRS 9 and this is commonly referred to as the “first day impact”.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has issued a paper on “Regulatory treatment of accounting provisions – interim approach and transitional arrangement” on March 2017, to provide a transitional arrangement to stagger the impact on capital up to a certain period of time to address the significant negative impact arising from the introduction of expected credit loss accounting. The staggering of the first day impact will enable banks to rebuild their capital and reduce the stress on capital.

5. Impact on the Banking Sector in Sri Lanka

5.1 Impact on Banks Capital Positions

Based on the available information, the increase in existing loan loss provisions as first day adjustment is expected on average to be around 20% to 40% for the Sri Lankan banking sector and will vary depending on the respective banks business models and practices.

In addition to the first day impact, the adoption of SLFRS 9 is also expected to have a considerable impact on capital positions and the growth ability of banks, with recognition of stage 1 losses immediately in the income statement, as and when new facilities are granted. Further, with the phase-in arrangement of higher capital requirements under Basel III, Enhanced Minimum Capital Requirements and proposed Leverage Ratio, certain banks may face a challenging position to ensure sustained growth, while maintaining appropriate levels of capital.

5.2 Credit Risk Modelling

Currently, the standardised approach is used to measure the credit risk in Sri Lankan banks under Basel III. However, all banks will need to move towards model-based approaches to calculate the expected credit loss under SLFRS 9. Modelling of expected credit risk under SLFRS 9 requires banks to extract vast amount of additional information that have not been used before and, accordingly, banks are expected to invest in upgrading their management information systems.

5.3 Point of Deterioration of Credit Quality

SLFRS 9, introduces a rebuttable presumption that significant increase in credit risk will occur when the borrower has not settled dues within 30 days and hence it requires assets to be classified as underperforming while recognising life time expected loss for such credit facilities. Under LKAS 39, one criterion used by the banking sector to consider facilities for impairment was the threshold of 90 days, in line with the prevailing regulatory classification of credit facilities. However, the 30-day rebuttable presumption can only be rebutted if banks can prove that credit risk has not increased significantly even though contractual payments have not been paid by the borrowers for more than 30 days. The industry experts, observe that rebutting the above presumption will be challenging in the Sri Lankan context.

6. Way Forward

6.1 Approach of the Central Bank

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has already reviewed the preparedness of banks and impact to the banking sector on adopting SLFRS 9 and intends to issue broad guidelines on the adoption of SLFRS 9 by licensed banks, to ensure the consistent application of SLFRS 9 and to streamline the implementation process. Further, CBSL will facilitate a dialogue between relevant stakeholders on SLFRS 9 and build an effective channel of communication between banks and CASL to ensure consistent application across the sector.

CBSL will consider a similar approach as provided by BIS, to stagger the impact on Capital Adequacy for a few years, in order to enable banks to absorb the increase of loan loss provisions due to the adoption of SLFRS 9. CBSL also intends to assess the status of banks on the adoption of SLFRS 9 and will facilitate all efforts to build capacity within the sector.

6.2 Supervisory Expectations

Due to the limited expertise available in banks, most banks have obtained the services of consultants to guide the SLFRS 9 implementation process. Therefore, banks

are expected to ensure capacity building within the organisations, by providing suitable training to staff and acquiring the required skills.

Further, banks are required to build new models to determine loan loss provisions and due to the complexity in the models, the implementation process will require a significant amount of time and preparedness and hence effective coordination and communication within internal functions in banks will become more important. Specially, internal audit and risk management departments of banks along with the senior management must ensure consistent bank-wide application of SLFRS 9, including validating models and ensure the proper documentation of the adoption process is in place. Banks are also expected to make a new range of qualitative disclosures on financial assets, use of judgements and expected loss provisioning process in the financial statements, to facilitate proper market conduct.

Boards of Directors of banks, particularly the Board Audit Committee, are expected to oversee the SLFRS 9 implementation process on a regular basis, while streamlining capital planning, stress testing and internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) in line with the adoptation of SLFRS 9, to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and address other challenges banks may face. Going forward, CBSL expects consistent application across the banking sector on models to be used, model inputs, use of assumptions and disclosures relating to SLFRS 9.

6.3 Future Benefits

Amidst the challenges, timely adoption of SLFRS 9 in banks will lead to improved management information systems, strong credit-management practices, enhanced disclosures and the need to closely monitor the behaviour of each credit facility from the point of origination. Therefore, SLFRS 9 is expected to result in enhanced credit quality, advanced performance monitoring systems of credit facilities, increased shock absorption capacity and improved prudence and risk management across the banking sector.

are also required to formulate capital plans to meet

the enhanced requirements, where necessary.

Licensed banks that fail to comply with these

requirements will not be permitted to pay dividends,

repatriate profits or adopt any other measure that

will further deteriorate the capital of the bank until

such compliance is affected.

Further, any new locally incorporated licensed

commercial bank and licensed specialised

bank are required to bring in Rs. 20 billion and

History of Technology in Banking

The banking sector has embraced the use of technology throughout its transformation from a brick-and-mortar style banking to digital banking. In the past, such as in 600 BC, the first official coin was minted and thereon the journey passed many milestones; the first cheque was written in 1659, the credit card was originated in 1920s, the first debit card was issued in 1978 and in 1984 the first on-line shopping transaction was executed.

Era of Digitalisation

As technology entwined into customer needs, it opened opportunities that never existed in conventional banking, leading to banks transforming to the digitalised era. As mobile wallets, e-wallets, pre-paid cards, contactless cards, wrist band payments and other digitalised alternatives are gaining attraction, fewer people tend to visit the bank in person. With continual improvements in technology and consumers’ increasing reliance on it, changes to delivery of banking products are likely to happen more efficiently and effectively.

Future driven by Technology

Fintechs and telecommunication companies (telcos) in the recent past have led innovation while radically altering the financial ecosystem. They offer personalised solutions for tech-savvy customers, catering to the changing dynamics of customers and demand for digital financial services. Fintechs and telcos have the potential to lessen barriers to enter into financial services, elevate the reliance on information driven financial services and drive the emergence of new business models. The fast pace of change in fintechs and telcos has made the business models of banks more challenging and competitive. Banks need to thrive in the digital economy to compete with new entrants, by being cost effective and serving based on customer demographics. However, banks need to be able to navigate through a strong regulatory framework in line with the risks involved, to fully embrace opportunities presented by the digital era.

Emerging Technologies

During the recent past the banking sector has been attracted towards the following emerging technologies:

(a) Open banking

In open banking, third party applications will be permitted to access consented customer data through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This provides greater convenience and choice in banking by allowing access to different banks through a single electronic platform.

BOX 10The Future of Banking driven by Technology

(b) Cloud computing

Cloud computing is a shift in how computer processing resources are generated, consumed and shared. Service providers offer data centers so that banks do not require the maintenance of their own data centers as they have access to on-demand processing and storage facilities. Cloud computing provides cost efficiency, operational flexibility and increased security. However, privacy of data, uninterrupted accessibility, and implications over national security remain to be addressed in the adoption process.

(c) Electronic onboarding (e-onboarding) and authentication

The face-to-face interaction when establishing the business relationship has been a salient feature of banking. However, as banks leverage on technology and customers are unwilling to visit a bank at least once, e-onboarding of customers is becoming a necessity. The benefits are obvious; however the challenge would be effective adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) requirements.

(d) Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography, and operates independent of a central bank. Regulators are cautious on cryptocurrency due to their associated risks such as monetary implications, speculative pressure, security breaches, lack of regulations, money laundering/financing of terrorism risks and tax evasion. Certain regulators have taken a restrictive approach due to these risks.

(e) Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain

DLT is an asset database that can be shared across a network where participants can have their own identical copy of the ledger. Blockchain is a variation of DLT where data is organised in blocks. Certain countries are exploring its usage in compiling credit information, sharing KYC, detecting money laundering and other forms of illicit finance. DLT developments, including blockchain, trigger concerns over data privacy and lack of industry standards.

(f) Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analytics

Artificial intelligence has enabled the computer programs to interact and learn to undertake tasks

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

2588

previously done by humans and has enabled faster and accurate decision making. Main benefits are enhanced customer personalisation, productivity gains, fraud mitigation, and better product/service recommendations. This has been complimented by the developments in big data analytics, allowing the analysis of unstructured data like pictures, voice records, and social media behaviours.

Emerging Risks in the Banking Sector due to High Reliance on Technology:

(a) Risks in money laundering, Know Your Customer (KYC) and financing of terrorism

Replacement of traditional banking by disruptive innovations impair the ability of banks in effective surveillance. Fintech and e-banking developments force banks to adopt e-customer onboarding, eliminating face-to-face interaction, imposing a heightened level of money laundering/KYC/financing of terrorism threat.

(b) Technology risk management and cyber security

The unstoppable trend towards digitalisation in the banking sector increases the technology and cyber risk exposure. Recent high profile global cyber-attacks have shown its increasing sophistication and frequency, threatening the stability and soundness of the financial system.

(c) Privacy and data protection

Customers’ right to privacy and data protection has become a growing concern with challenges posed by the new transformed operating environment of banks. Data leakages across the world has proven that sensitive customer information can end up in wrong hands, unless protected.

(d) Demise of humane and intuitive decision making

The dominance of big data analytics and machine learning algorithms in the decision-making process of banks detaches the industry further from society, posing the risk of sole dependence on inputs fed on systems.

Challenges

Making changes to legal and regulatory frameworks, challenging role of central banks and banks are the main challenges that are faced in technology driven banking, as discussed below.

(a) Making changes to legal and regulatory frameworks

Rapid technological advances cause existing legal and regulatory frameworks to become outdated.

The long process to be followed in introducing new laws and regulations further complicates the situation. In the local context, Computer Crime Act and Electronic Transactions Act are key legislations governing the matters related to information systems and e-transactions. Further, specific regulations imposed by the Central Bank cover areas on information security, availability of systems, and customer protection. However, areas like data protection, cryptocurrency, and cloud computing remain to be adequately addressed through legislations and regulations.

(b) Challenging role of central banks

The society’s prevalent adoption of new technologies like cryptocurrency and DLT pose challenges to both price stability and financial system stability objectives of central banks. It is also probable that a large unregulated alternative financial system come into existence, unless technological advances are not carefully brought under the purview of regulations.

(c) Challenging role of banks

Banks are faced with constantly evolving challenges that require comprehension and appropriate reactions while going forward in the digital era. They require cautious defensive mechanisms to address new loopholes/evolving cyberattacks/possible AML/CFT and other regulatory non-compliances, parallel to achieving their business objectives. The Board of Directors and top management of banks need to understand the risks associated with technology in the decision making process.

Way Forward

Cautious adoption of technology

Banks relying on innovative technologies need to ensure that effective risk management processes and controls are in place to address new sources of risks effectively. Further, as banks are increasingly relying on third party service providers for technology based financial services, the adequacy of controls over those services should remain of the same standard as if the bank itself has conducted the service.

Need expertise on technology and far sighted Boards for leadership

The importance of information technology goes beyond the management of infrastructure and maintaining applications for the business. Prudent and far sighted Boards, equipped with relevant digital literacy, are essential in assuring the strategic alignment of IT function and prudent management of technology and cyber risk for future banking.

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

Adaptive regulatory approach and use of technology in regulation (RegTech)

A supportive and conscious regulatory regime is essential for society to derive maximum benefit from disruptive innovations and to adequately protect against emerging risks. Clearly spelled out regulations for the use of technology will help maintain financial system stability and subdue the risk of emergence of a large unregulated alternative financial system.

Strengthening technology risk resilience

In this regard, CBSL has developed a roadmap to improve technology risk resilience in the banking sector, which includes technology risk assessments, external confirmations in compliance with Baseline Security Standards, security reviews on information and communication technology infrastructure, awareness sessions for Boards and top management, training/certification programs for technology risk management

staff, regulations on a minimum number of IT staff with designated qualifications, and having professionals qualified in information security in the internal audit.

Further, CBSL is in the process of exploring the possibility of mandating banks with higher inherent technology risk to establish dedicated information security operations centers (ISOC) or subscribe to a third party shared ISOC. In addition, CBSL is in the process of establishing policy frameworks for streamlining the digitalisation of banking operations, defining minimum regulatory expectations on cloud computing and use of fintech solutions. CBSL has also established two committees with industry participation to study and provide recommendations on the use of blockchain technology and adoption of suitable fintech innovations in Sri Lanka. These initiatives will provide a legislative and regulatory basis for a level playing field between fintechs and incumbent banks.

A circular was issued to licensed banks

permitting the banks to charge interest rates

and penal interest as per their policies with a

view to reducing non-performing loans, rising

market interest rates and the requirement to

discourage unproductive short-term personal

loans, which have increased during the recent

past. Such rates are required to be published along

with the basis of calculation and changes prior to

effecting such revision. This will enable all licensed

banks to charge a competitive interest rate on

credit products. However, the banks were advised

to charge penal interest, if any, only for the amount

in arrears during the overdue period. Banks were

also requested to ensure that applicable interest

rates on credit products are published in a legible

manner when promoting credit products in any

media at all times and to publish penal interest

rates, if any, with basis of computation at least in

the bank's website for the information of the public

and to update regularly to reflect the current rates.

Banks were requested to inform borrowers on

applicable interest rates prior to the completion of

credit documentation and any subsequent changes

to interest rates prior to effecting any such revision

to existing credit.

With the intention of preventing smuggling of

gold out of the country through bulk purchases

of pawned gold articles at auctions conducted by

banks, a determination was issued instructing

licensed banks to report monthly details of

the purchases of gold articles of Rs. 500,000

or above at auctions. Further, any suspicious

transactions, which indicate a collusion between

two or more parties in order to buy large quantities

of gold at auctions should also be reported.

Licensed banks were informed to grant

concessions on a case-by-case basis

to the borrowers affected by the floods,

adverse weather conditions and connected

circumstances in terms of the national policy

adopted to facilitate the rehabilitation of businesses

and normal operations of borrowers in the national

interest and report details to the Director of Bank

Supervision by 30 June 2017.

In order to support the Government’s

initiative for enhancing access to finance, as

proposed in the Budget 2017, licensed banks

were informed to take appropriate measures

to increase distribution of credit to certain

identified sectors. Accordingly, credit granted as

a percentage of total loans, may not be less than

2608

10 per cent each for small and medium enterprises,

exports and tourism activities and for agriculture

and 5 per cent each for youth and women.

Licensed banks were further informed to

enhance several banking services, such as

maintaining at least 15 per cent of deposits

mobilised by each branch within the same area

for credit granted by bank branches, expediting

the process of granting credit with a value of

less than Rs. 5 million in less than one month,

and at least opening one branch in each district

on all 7 days of the week, excluding the religious

holidays. Further, commencing 01 July 2017, all

licensed banks were required to report details of

credit granted as required above, for each quarter,

in order to monitor the banks’ compliance with the

national policy.

representing 7.9 per cent of Sri Lanka’s financial

system. The sector remained strong, with capital

maintained at healthy levels along with adequate

liquidity buffers well above the regulatory minimum

levels. The sector exhibits a shift in funding mix,

as increased assets were mainly funded through

deposits while borrowings of the sector declined

compared to the high growth recorded during the

previous year. The Central Bank continued to take

prudential measures to maintain the stability of

the sector with much consideration on reviving the

companies with weak financial positions.

Business Growth

(a) Outreach: By the end of 2017, the sector

comprised of 45 LFCs and 6 SLCs. During

the year, two amalgamations were completed

between Chilaw Finance PLC merging with

Richard Peiris Finance Ltd. and Isuru Leasing

Co. Ltd. merging with Central Finance PLC. LFCs

and SLCs contributed to economic activities and

development throughout the year by enhancing

services provided to customers and expanding its

branch network. By end 2017, there were 1,362

branches and 781 other outlets of the LFCs and

SLCs sector. Out of total branches, 920 branches

(67 per cent) were concentrated outside of the

Western Province.

(b) Assets: The total asset base of the sector

grew moderately by Rs. 143 billion during the year

reaching Rs. 1,355 billion by end 2017, at a growth

rate of 11.8 per cent, compared to the 21.7 per

cent growth reported in 2016. The assets base of

the sector mainly consisted of loans and advances

and accounted for 78 per cent of the total assets

which contributed to 66 per cent of the assets

growth. Finance leases accounted for 50 per

cent of the loans and advances followed by other

secured loans which accounted for 40 per cent.

The overall credit expansion indicated

clear signs of slowing down the sector growth

during the year 2017. The slowdown of credit

growth witnessed during the year, compared

to 2016 can be attributed to fiscal and

macroprudential policy measures taken to curtail

the importation of motor vehicles and lending

towards vehicles, the moderate economic growth

witnessed in the economy during the year and high

interest rates that prevailed in the market. Credit

growth of the sector decelerated to 9.8 per cent

(Rs. 94 billion) amounting to Rs. 1,057.1 billion,

compared to 21.0 per cent experienced during

2016. Around 62 per cent of this growth was through

finance leases, while 36 per cent was through

secured loans and advances. The hire purchase

portfolio contracted during the year by Rs. 15 billion

(35.6 per cent). However, the growth of finance

lease portfolio for the year 2017 was 13 per cent,

compared to the growth of 17 per cent recorded

in the year 2016.

The growth of investment portfolio, which

comprises investment in equities, capital market

debt instruments, government securities and

investment properties, slowed down during the

year 2017, with a growth rate of 5.7 per cent,

compared to the growth of 12.1 per cent in 2016.

The investments in government securities and

investment in equities declined during the year

and there was a notable increase in investment

in unit trusts during the year. Other assets mainly

comprised cash, balances with banks and financial

institutions, trading stocks, and fixed assets, which

showed an increase of 30.8 per cent in 2017,

largely due to increased placements in banks and

financial institutions.

(c) Liabilities: Customer deposits became the

major portion of liabilities in 2017 and accounted

for 50.7 per cent of the total liabilities of the sector.

Sector borrowings and capital accounted for

29.2 per cent and 12.5 per cent, respectively.

The sector exhibited a shift in the funding mix

as the expansion was largely funded through

the customer deposit mobilisation. The deposits

grew by 29.4 per cent to Rs. 686.7 billion in 2017,

compared to the growth of 10.4 per cent in 2016.

Time deposits grew by 29.2 per cent compared to

the growth of 11.1 per cent in the year 2016 and

savings deposits grew by 35.3 per cent compared

to the negative growth of 1.7 per cent recorded

in the previous year. Nevertheless, time deposits

accounted for a major share of total deposits,

representing 95.5 per cent. The sector borrowings

indicated a negative growth of 9.7 per cent to

Rs. 396.0 billion in 2017, compared with the high

growth of borrowings of 39.6 per cent experienced

during 2016. The increasing reliance on deposits

were mainly attributed to the declining trend of

deposit interest rates.

The capital elements of the sector increased by

16.1 per cent to Rs. 169.7 billion as at end 2017,

mainly on account of steps taken by companies

to enhance the minimum core capital to meet the

Rs. 1 billion requirement by 01 January 2018 as

well as through the internally generated profits for

the financial year 2016/17.

Risks in the LFCs and SLCs sector

(a) Credit Risk: Gross non-performing loans

(NPLs) portfolio increased to Rs. 65.9 billion by

Rs. 12.9 billion in 2017 (24 per cent) mainly due

to the floods that occurred during the first half of

2017, nationwide drought and slowing down of the

economy. The gross NPL ratio increased to 5.9 per

cent in 2017 from 5.3 per cent reported in 2016

due to the increase in gross NPLs and decline in

the growth of the loan portfolio. The total loan loss

provisions increased by Rs. 7.4 billion to Rs. 42.2

billion due to the increase in the specific provisions

made for NPLs. The provision coverage ratio

declined to 64.0 per cent in 2017, compared to 65.7

per cent in 2016. As a result, net NPL ratio increased

to 1.5 per cent in 2017 from the reported ratio of

1.2 per cent in 2016, showing signs of deterioration

in the asset quality of the sector. However, with

appropriate risk mitigation techniques, credit risk of

the sector remained at manageable levels.

(b) Market Risk: The LFCs and SLCs continued

to experience a minimal market risk due to the lower

exposure to trading portfolio and foreign currency

denominated exposures.

Interest Rate Risk: Along with the gradual

decrease in interest rates towards the second

half of the year, interest rate risk of the sector

decreased. The prevailing negative mismatch in

the maturity profile of the interest bearing assets

and liabilities of the sector enabled to maintain a

positive net interest margin.

Prices of Equity: Equity risk of the sector remained

low during the year as the exposure to equity

market in the form of investment in listed shares

was minimal at Rs. 14.2 billion, which was only

1.0 per cent of the total assets of the sector.

(c) Liquidity Risk: The overall statutory

liquid assets available in the sector during 2017

showed a surplus of Rs. 35.5 billion as against

the stipulated minimum requirement of Rs. 91.1

billion. The surplus liquid assets increased during

2017 compared to Rs. 15.4 billion in 2016 due to

the contraction of lending activities of the sector.

As a result, the liquid assets to total assets ratio

increased to 8.9 per cent from 7.1 per cent in 2016.

The liquid asset to deposits ratio was well above

the statutory minimum requirement of 10.0 per cent

of time deposits and borrowings, and 15 .0 per cent

of savings deposits as at end 2017.

Profitability and Capital Resources

(a) Profitability: The net interest income of

the sector increased at a slower rate than in 2016,

recording a growth of 11.5 per cent to Rs. 102.7

billion. This was mainly due to the increase in

interest expenses by 33.1 per cent, compared to

the growth of interest income only by 22.6 per cent.

As a result, net interest margin of the sector (net

interest income as a percentage of average assets)

declined marginally to 7.7 per cent in 2017 from 7.9

per cent in 2016. Non-interest income increased

by 20.3 per cent mainly due to the increase in

default charges and other service charges, while

non-interest expenses also increased by 21.9 per

cent, affecting adversely towards sector profitability,

mainly due to the increase in staff costs. The loan

loss provisions made against NPLs, which was

Rs. 13.5 billion, increased by Rs. 6 billion

during 2017, when compared to the provision of

1. Introduction

Customer confidence and trust are the main pillars in the financial services market that promote financial stability, growth, efficiency and innovation over the long term. In this regard, it is important to root out unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts of financial service providers by enforcing the laws, enhancing customer knowledge through increasing financial literacy, improving disclosure requirements, promoting responsible conduct of both the customers and the service providers, and providing an opportunity to access effective complaint handling mechanisms.

2. Present Status of Financial Customer Protection in Sri Lanka

In Sri Lanka, the Consumer Affairs Authority was established under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, No. 9 of 2003. It is empowered to take the necessary actions to safeguard the interests of the customers of goods and services, whereas limited protection is available for customers of financial services. The Financial Ombudsman office was established in 2003, specifically to protect the rights and interests of financial customers. The Sri Lanka Banks’ Association established a credit counselling centre named, “Upadeshana” in January 2009, to provide counselling services for financially distressed persons. Apart from the above, there is no formal authority to protect the rights and interests of the financial customers in Sri Lanka.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has issued a Direction on a customer charter for licensed banks, in December 2011, in view of safeguarding the rights and interests of bank customers. It is designed to build up a healthy relationship between customers and licensed banks and thereby, ensure customer confidence and stability in the banking sector. Further, a Direction on a customer charter was issued in November 2013, to govern the relationship between primary dealers and its customers, with the view of meeting the expectations of the investors in government securities.

3. Licensed Finance Companies(LFCs) and Specialised Leasing Companies(SLCs) sector

The LFCs and SLCs sector has expanded throughout the country, with a branch network of approximately 1,360 branches, serving nearly 3 million loan customers and 4 million depositors. Even though the sector is facilitating financial inclusion in the country, over the past few years there have been several malpractices reported regarding the conduct of businesses, which are detrimental to the rights of customers and stability of the financial system. These include, unethical recovery practices, multiple lending, and charging exorbitant interest rates and other

BOX 11Introduction of the Financial Customer Protection Framework for Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised Leasing Companies

charges leading to over indebtedness of the customer. Considering the above, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka decided to put in place a Financial Customer Protection Framework, with the objective of addressing the issues relating to the conduct of the business operations of the LFC and SLC sector.

4. New Financial Customer Protection Framework

The Financial Customer Protection Framework, which will come into effect from April 2018, includes a set of guidelines and instructions that need to be adhered to by the financial institutions to mitigate the potential harm to the customer, i.e. those who use any financial products/services. This framework was developed based on the high-level principles on financial consumer protection endorsed by G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Banks, and developed together with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, Financial Stability Board and other international organizations.

5. Salient Features of the Framework

5.1. Role and Responsibility of the Board of Directors

The Boards of Directors of LFCs and SLCs are responsible for ensuring that customers are well informed and their rights are protected. This needs to be considered as an integral part of corporate governance, culture and strategic decision-making of financial institutions. The Boards of Directors are mandated to monitor the compliance of all employees and appointed agents with the minimum standards on customer protection set out in the Direction.

5.2. Minimum Standards on Financial Customer Protection

i. Disclosure and Transparency

The principle of disclosure and transparency is important as it is clearly in customers’ best interest that they are given complete, clear and non-misleading information about financial products and services. Information disclosure, which includes the standardized and prescribed information that should be made available to the customers, supports the decision-making process of the customers and allows them to make an informed assessment of the financial products/services on offer. An appropriate level of standardization provided in the Direction supports the customer by improving the opportunity to compare different products and services.

The Direction allows customers to receive key information that makes them aware of the fundamental benefits, risks and terms of the product in the language preferred

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

265

by them, i.e. Sinhala/Tamil/English. The disclosure and transparency requirements are applicable at all stages of the relationship with the customer as explained below.

• Advertisement Stage: All financial promotional material should be accurate, understandable and not misleading. The advertisements published in any form are required to cover the key information about the product/service and not be obscure and be in line with the advertisement regulations issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka from time to time.

• Pre-contractual Stage: Every company should have a standardized document in the form of a “key facts document” made available to all prospective customers, which contains basic information regarding loan and deposit products, such as description of the products/services, financial and other benefits, fees and charges, commissions, interest rates, procedures to be followed, major terms and conditions, complaint handling procedures, restrictions on accounts and transactions, etc.

• Contractual Stage: It is the right of the customer to obtain the opportunity to fully understand the terms & conditions on products/services. The provision of advice ought to be as objective as possible and based on the customer’s profile, considering the complexity of the product, the risks associated with it as well as the customer’s financial objectives, knowledge, capabilities and experience.

• Upon Request: Customers are entitled to receive product statements upon request, which includes detailed transactional information, interest rate charged, fees charged for reporting period and the outstanding balance.

• General Disclosures: All companies are required to display the finance business/finance leasing license issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, latest audited financial statements, credit rating, contact details of the Financial Ombudsman, business hours and holidays, in all business places.

ii. Customer Education and Awareness

Promoting customer education and awareness is of utmost importance in a sector which serves customers with low financial literacy levels. LFCs and SLCs are required to maintain appropriate mechanisms to help existing and future customers to improve their knowledge, skills and confidence, to appropriately understand the opportunities and risks of financial products/services. Customers need to be educated with specific warnings related to over indebtedness, consequences of multiple borrowing, late repayments, etc.

iii. Responsible Business Conduct

The principle of responsible business conduct is important to ensure that financial service providers and appointed agents act fairly, honestly, professionally, with due skill, care and diligence when dealing with customers. Depending on the nature of the transaction and based on the information primarily provided by customers, financial service providers should assess the related financial capabilities and needs of their customers before agreeing to provide them with a product, advice or service. Particular attention needs to be paid to the ability of the customer to financially bear the risks associated with the product/service. All financial service providers are required to conduct a customer repayment capacity analysis to properly assess credit worthiness, to prevent the over indebtedness of the customer.

Staff (especially those who interact directly with customers) need to be properly trained and qualified. In this regard, it is important to have continuous programs on capacity building and awareness on products/services in order to develop the soft skills of the staff. The remuneration structure for staff of both financial service providers and appointed agents should be designed to encourage responsible business conduct, fair treatment of customers and avoidance of unreasonable risk taking. Employees and appointed agents should avoid harassing customers, using abusive debt collection practices, disclosing customer information to others and giving false or misleading information about products/services and unduly influencing customers or the general public to buy or get involved in the products/services. Financial service providers are required to have rigorous and regular monitoring of the conduct of the employees and appointed agents.

iv. Complaint Handling and Redress

Effective complaint handling and redress mechanisms provided by financial service providers, regulators and other independent entities is central to financial customer protection. All customers should have access to adequate complaint handling and redress mechanisms that are accessible, affordable, independent, fair, accountable, timely and efficient. Such mechanisms should not impose unreasonable costs, delays or burdens on customers. In the first instance, customers are encouraged to seek recourse through the internal complaint handling mechanism and independent redress process, such as referring to the financial ombudsman or regulatory authority available, to address complaints that are not efficiently resolved by the financial service provider.

v. Equitable and Fair Treatment

Financial service providers and appointed agents are expected to adopt equitable and fair treatment of customers as an integral part of their business culture. Treating all the financial customers equitably, honestly

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

2668

Rs. 7.6 billion made in 2016, which also affected the

profitability in 2017. Accordingly, the sector posted

a profit after tax of Rs. 25.8 billion, an 18.0 per cent

decline compared to the profit of Rs. 31.5 billion

recorded in the year 2016, mainly due to increased

funding cost and higher loan loss provisions. ROA

decreased by 80 basis points during the year,

reporting a ratio of 3.2 per cent and ROE declined

nearly by 700 basis points, reporting a ratio of

16.1 per cent, which showed sign of stress towards

the profitability of the sector.

(b) Capital: The sector maintained its overall

capital level well above the minimum requirement

during the year, enhancing the resilience to any

perceived adverse shocks. The total regulatory

capital improved by 25.1 per cent to Rs. 145.3

billion, mainly due to efforts taken by the companies

to enhance the minimum capital requirement up

to Rs. 1 billion by 01 January 2018 as required,

coupled with increase in retained profits.

The capital adequacy ratios of the sector

demonstrated an increasing trend, in which core

capital and total capital ratios increased to 12.4 per

cent and 13.1 per cent, respectively, compared to

11.3 per cent and 11.7 per cent recorded in year

2016, which was well above the minimum threshold

level. The regulatory capital comprised of Tier I and

Tier II capital, of which Tier I capital contributed

to 95.9 per cent of the total regulatory capital.

Tier I capital mainly comprised issued share capital,

statutory reserve fund and published retained

profits. 82.8 per cent of the Tier II capital comprised

subordinated term debt, while revaluation reserves

represented 16.0 per cent. However, there were

few companies which maintained the capital below

the minimum required levels, due to weak financial

positions and necessary resolution actions are

currently being undertaken.

and fairly at all stages of their relationship with the financial service providers, irrespective of their cast, religion, language, gender, etc. is a requisite of the Direction. The customers such as elderly, differently abled or customers with low financial literacy have the right to receive special attention to facilitate them to have fair access to financial services.

vi. Protection of Customer Data and Privacy

All LFCs and SLCs are required to take necessary steps to protect customer data and privacy, in line with the applicable legal provisions. It is the responsibility of the financial service providers to inform customers regarding the sharing of personal data related to them with the Credit Information Bureau and the exact purpose and conditions of the collection, processing and distribution of data held about them and the related confidentiality rules adopted.

6. Conclusion

Due to the increased complexity of financial products/services, rapid technological changes and financial market development and innovation, often low income and less experienced customers face challenges in the market place. Failure to proactively identify and mitigate customer risks associated with the marketing and sale of financial products/services creates unnecessary risks to a financial institutions’ reputation and can result in loss of customers’ trust and confidence. With the implementation of the Financial Customer Protection Framework, it is expected that customer rights and interests will be safeguarded and customer confidence strengthened, to ensure the stability and soundness of the sector.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

During the year 2017, the Central Bank

initiated several prudential policy measures

to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory

framework of LFCs and SLCs with the aim of

enhancing the stability and soundness of the

sector and increasing the customer confidence

in the sector.

A new prudential direction was issued to

revise the LTV ratio for credit facilities in line

with the national budget proposal for year 2017.

Further, the minimum core capital requirement

for LFCs was increased to be completed on a

staggered basis, in view of strengthening the

capital position of the sector and increasing the

capacity to absorb unexpected internal and external

shocks. Accordingly, the minimum core capital was

increased from Rs. 400 million to Rs. 1.0 billion

by 01 January 2018, Rs. 1.5 billion by 01 January

2019, Rs. 2.0 billion by 01 January 2020 and

Rs. 2.5 billion by 01 January 2021.

Numerous regulatory actions were taken

regarding weak LFCs and SLCs during the

year. A cap on deposits and borrowings was

imposed on all LFCs and SLCs, which did not

comply with the minimum core capital requirement.

Penalties were imposed on non-compliances

identified through supervision of LFCs and SLCs.

Further, a lending cap was imposed on one LFC

due to repeated non-compliance of supervisory

concerns. Initiatives are being taken to resolve

distressed finance companies, largely through

mergers and recapitalization through strategic

investors. In order to streamline such regulatory

actions, a resolution framework for the financial

system is to be introduced with the concurrence of

the newly established Resolution and Enforcement

Department.

A circular was issued in May 2017, where LFCs

and SLCs were allowed to grant concessions to

borrowers who have been affected by floods,

circumstances in terms of the national policy

adopted to facilitate the rehabilitation of businesses

and normal operations of such borrowers in the

national interest.

Primary Dealers in Government Securities

The Primary Dealer (PD) sector recorded

gradual moderation of its activities during

the year. Total assets, total investment portfolio

and total capital of 7 LCBs, primary dealers and

8 Standalone PDs1 recorded a considerable growth,

whereas the profitability of the industry recorded a

marginal decline.

Assets and Liabilities

The total assets of the PD sector increased

by 29.7 per cent to Rs. 337.2 billion in 2017,

compared to Rs. 260.0 billion in 2016. Total

investment portfolio of government securities

accounted for 93.2 per cent of the total assets of

the industry. This investments portfolio, consisting

of trading, available for sale and HTM, amounted to

Rs. 314.2 billion at end 2017, recording an increase

of 41.0 per cent over 2016. This change was due

to the significant increase in the trading portfolio

and the available for sale portfolio of government

securities. The trading portfolio increased to

Rs. 127.6 billion by end 2017, from Rs. 96.6 billion at

end 2016 and available for sale portfolio, increased

to Rs. 78.7 billion by end 2017, compared to

Rs. 19.3 billion at end 2016. HTM portfolio

increased marginally to Rs. 107.8 billion at end

2017, from Rs. 106.8 billion reported at end 2016.

1 Two PDs, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) and Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC – Primary Dealer Unit (PABC), were suspended from carrying on business and activities of a primary dealer for a period of six months (PTL w.e.f. 06th July 2017 and PABC w.e.f. 15th August 2017 initially and the suspension of PTL was extended further six months period from 05 January 2018). Entrust Securities PLC does not participate in government securities primary auctions w.e.f. 24 July 2017.

Risks in PD Sector

(a) Market Risk: The proportion of trading

portfolio to total investment portfolio decreased

from 43.4 per cent at end 2016 to 40.6 per cent at

end 2017, reducing the possible high market risk

exposure of the industry.

(b) Liquidity Risk: The overall liquidity risk

exposure of the PD industry decreased due to

the reduction in overnight negative mismatch in

the maturity profile of assets and liabilities of the

industry at end 2017. The overnight negative

mismatch decreased significantly to Rs. 1,077.4

million or 9.5 per cent of the overnight liabilities at

end 2017, from Rs. 2,671.8 million or 15.7 per cent

reported at end 2016. In view of holding a large

volume of risk free government securities by PDs

and the ability to use such government securities

as collateral for obtaining funds to bridge any

unforeseen liquidity gaps, the liquidity risk profile

of PDs remained low throughout the year except

for one PD that was facing liquidity issues since

the fourth quarter of 2015. Most of the PDs had

stand-by contingency funding arrangements to

bridge any liquidity gaps.

Profitability and Capital

The PDs industry reported a profit after tax

of Rs. 13.4 billion during 2017 against that of

Rs. 14.7 billion during 2016. Despite the

substantial increase in net interest income, from

Rs. 8.8 billion during 2016 to Rs. 14.1 billion during

2017, the significant reduction in capital gains was

reported from Rs. 8.4 billion in 2016 to Rs. 2.1

billion in 2017, largely contributing to the decrease

of profits of the PD industry. Nevertheless, the

exorbitant capital gains in 2016 was as a result

of the sale of government securities by one PD.

Consequently, ROA for the sector and ROE for

standalone PDs decreased to 5.1 per cent and

12.9 per cent, respectively, by end 2017, from

5.8 per cent and 52.1 per cent in 2016.

Equity of the PDs increased by 17.5 per cent

largely due to the enhancement of the minimum

core capital requirement, from Rs. 350 million to

Rs. 1,000 million. As at end 2017, all standalone

PDs, except Entrust Securities PLC, maintained their

core capital above the minimum requirement of

Rs. 1,000 million. The Risk Weighted Capital

Adequacy Ratio (RWCAR) of the standalone PDs

was above the minimum RWCAR of 10 per cent and

the ratio decreased to 55.9 per cent at end 2017 from

61.5 per cent reported at end 2016, subsequent to

the increase of minimum core capital.

Market Participation

Primary Market Activities: The participation

in primary market auctions in respect of Treasury

bills and Treasury bonds by PDs has shown mixed

Insurance Sector

The insurance sector recorded a growth

in terms of its asset base, while earnings

declined during 2017. As at end 2017,

27 insurance companies were operating with the

licences obtained from the Insurance Regulatory

Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL), out of which,

13 companies operated as exclusive general

insurance companies, 12 companies operated

as exclusive life insurance companies and

2 companies were involved in both long-term and

general insurance business. It was noted that

9 insurance companies were listed with the

Colombo Stock Exchange. Further, there were

61 insurance brokering companies engaged

exclusively in general insurance or engaged in both

general and long-term insurance.

Insurance penetration in Sri Lanka which is

calculated on total premium as a percentage

of GDP (at current market prices), remained at

1.2 per cent in 2017. This amount is considerably

lower than the peer countries, urging the requirement

of popularizing insurance in Sri Lanka. Insurance

penetration for long-term insurance was 0.5 per

cent, whereas general insurance penetration was

0.7 in 2017. Nevertheless, insurance density has

increased marginally to Rs. 7,482 per person in

2017, from Rs. 6,743 per person in 2016.

Business Growth

The total assets of the insurance sector grew

during 2017, mainly due to the growth in the

long-term insurance sector assets even though

the general insurance sector assets declined.

Asset growth of the insurance sector during 2017

was 7.2 per cent, resulting in a total asset base of

Rs. 559.2 billion as at end 2017, when compared

to Rs. 521.4 billion as at end 2016. This expansion

was as a result of the growth in the long-term

insurance sector. This sub sector grew by 14.0 per

cent during the year to reach Rs. 394.2 billion, from

Rs. 345.7 billion as at end 2016. A notable increase

in the share of long-term insurance as against

the total asset base was observed as the share

increased to 70.5 per cent in 2017 as against the

share of 66.3 per cent in 2016. However, the overall

general insurance sub sector reported a decline in

its asset base, to 165.1 billion in 2017, compared

to Rs. 175.7 billion as at end 2016. Accordingly,

the share of this sector as a percentage of total

insurance sector assets declined to 29.6 per cent

in 2017, from 33.7 per cent in 2016.

Growth in Gross Written Premium (GWP)

of the insurance sector was driven by both

by 12.2 per cent in 2017. Despite losing its share

to the long-term insurance sub sector in terms of

total asset base, the general insurance sub-sector

continued to be the main contributor towards

total GWP of the insurance sector with a share of

55.4 per cent. The growth in the GWP of the general

insurance sector was 11.9 per cent, amounting to

Rs. 88.9 billion at end 2017. Motor insurance, which

indicated an increase of 9.1 per cent during 2017,

is the main contributor for the GWP of the general

insurance sector. The motor insurance sector

contributed to 60.5 per cent of the GWP of general

insurance sector. The long-term insurance sector’s

GWP has also grown similarly, with a growth rate

of 12.6 per cent during the year, amounting to

Rs. 71.5 billion.

Earnings

Despite the improvement of earnings of

the long-term insurance sector, the overall

earnings of the insurance sector declined as

a result of the sharp decrease of the general

insurance sector earnings. Total profits earned

by the insurance sector reduced by 3.6 per cent in

2017, compared to a 67.5 per cent growth in 2016.

This drastic change was mainly due to the decline

in the performance of the general insurance sector.

However, it was observed that the long-term

insurance sector has improved considerably as a

and enhancing the reputation of the industry,

while safeguarding the interest of the

policyholders. A Direction on ancillary services

provided by insurance brokers was issued, which

required insurance brokers to seek approval of

the IRCSL to provide ancillary services other

than insurance brokering. A direction prohibiting

all insurance brokers from marketing and/or

canvasing for sale, on behalf of any other

insurance broker/sub agent or foreign health

insurance product was also issued. Further, all

insurers are required to employ at least one person

with Associate of Chartered Insurance Institute,

or equivalent qualification, to be designated as a

specified officer, as per the roles and responsibility

defined by the IRCSL.

cent. The total investments of the ETF rose by

11.8 per cent to Rs. 262.5 billion at the end of 2017.

The investment profile of the ETF is similar to that

of the EPF with the majority of its investments

in government securities. However, there was

a significant drop in investments in government

securities to 78.2 per cent at end 2017 from the

91.2 per cent recorded at the end of 2016. The fund

has made arrangements to reinvest inflows from

divested government securities in term deposits.

Investments in equity and corporate fixed income

securities accounted for 2.7 per cent and 1.4 per

cent, respectively, of total investments during the

year and the fund managed to secure a rate of

return of 9.6 per cent on its investments.

Other Superannuation Funds

The Public Service Provident Fund (PSPF),

which is 15.4 per cent of the Sri Lankan

superannuation sector, contracted in terms

of number of members and net contributions,

while asset grew during the year. The fund,

which has been established with a view to provide

benefits to certain non-pensionable government

sector employees, recorded a slight decline in

total number of members. However, all 239,184

members of the fund were active at end 2017.

A positive net contribution of Rs. 843.8 million

was recorded during 2017, compared to Rs. 909.3

million recorded in 2016. The total asset base

of the fund grew by 16.2 per cent and stood at

Rs. 55.4 billion. Further, the investment of the

PSPF improved to 52.9 billion in 2017, compared to

46.2 billion recorded at end 2016. The investments

were highly concentrated in government securities

and accounted for 94.5 per cent of total investments.

The rate of return on member balances was

13.0 per cent for the year 2017.

APPFs, accounting for 1.9 per cent of the

superannuation sector, expanded in terms

of the number of members, total assets and

investments. However, the number of approved

provident funds declined to 149 by the end of

2017, from the 152 that remained by the end of

2016. These private provident funds covered a

membership of 169,301 persons. The total assets

of the APPFs is estimated to be Rs. 437.3 billion

as at end 2017. This is a 9.7 per cent growth from

the asset base of Rs. 398.6 billion that remained

during 2017. Investment portfolios of such funds

amounted to Rs. 267.1 billion as at 2017, recording

a 9.5 per cent growth.

8.4 Performance of Financial Markets

Money Market

The Average Weighted Call Money Rate

(AWCMR) was allowed to move closer to the

upper bound of the Standing Rate Corridor

(SRC), formed by the Standing Deposit Facility

Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility

Rate (SLFR), till early August. It was brought

downwards thereafter, and was maintained at levels

around the middle of the SRC from around mid-

September till the end of the year. The AWCMR,

which was at 8.42 per cent by end December

2016, was allowed to increase towards the upper

bound of the SRC with the decline in excess money

market liquidity, which reached deficit levels by

around mid-February 2017 Continuing to tighten

its monetary policy stance, the Central Bank raised

its policy interest rates by 25 basis points each in

March 2017, as a result of which the SDFR and

the SLFR increased to 7.25 per cent and 8.75 per

cent, respectively. Consequently, the AWCMR

increased further and was maintained at rates

close to the upper bound of the SRC until early

August 2017. While the money market continued

to have surplus levels of liquidity since around

mid-July 2017, the weighted average yield rate at

the daily overnight repo auctions conducted by the

Central Bank was brought down gradually to settle

at the floor of the SRC in the latter part of the year,

and it was 7.25 per cent by end December 2017.

Following this trend, the AWCMR also declined to

around 8.00 per cent by mid-September 2017 and

increased marginally thereafter to stabilise around

8.15 per cent, and remained at that level by end

December 2017. Following the movements of call

money rates, the Average Weighted Repo Rate,

which had moved close to the upper bound of the

SRC till early August, declined thereafter, and by

end December 2017 it was at 8.52 per cent, having

recorded a sharper drop than the AWCMR.

Excess rupee liquidity in the domestic

money market increased sharply at the

beginning of 2017. Whilst declining to deficit

levels by early February, market liquidity fluctuated

thereafter, between deficit and surplus levels, up

to mid-July. Since mid-July, the domestic money

market continued to have excess rupee liquidity.

The sharp increase in money market liquidity from

a surplus of Rs. 39.2 billion at end 2016 to over

Rs. 100 billion at the beginning of the year 2017

was mainly due to an increase in the Central Bank’s

claims on the Government, following the Central

Bank’s purchases of Treasury bills in the primary

market as well as provisional advances made to the

government. However, thereafter, money market

liquidity declined and the market experienced a

deficit in market liquidity from time to time from

around mid-February until mid-July, primarily as

a result of the Central Bank allowing its Treasury

bills holdings to mature as well as outright sales

of Treasury bills by the Central Bank. Seasonal

withdrawals of currency also drained rupee liquidity

during the month of April. This situation however

reversed in the second half of the year as a result of

net purchases of foreign exchange by the Central

Bank in the domestic foreign exchange market.

While the money market continued to have excess

liquidity from around mid-July, the excess liquidity

in the money market amounted to Rs. 18.3 billion

by end 2017.

Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank

declined substantially during the year as a result

of maturities and outright sales of Treasury

bills. Central Bank holdings of Treasury bills

amounted to Rs. 9.9 billion by end 2017, compared

to the holdings of Treasury bills amounting to

Rs. 331.4 billion at the beginning of 2017. Since,

the reduction in the Central Bank’s holdings of

Treasury bills was not sufficient to drain market

liquidity, the use of alternative instruments to absorb

the excess liquidity in the market was necessitated.

Accordingly, the Bond Borrowing Programme,

where the Central Bank borrows Treasury bonds

from an institutional investor to provide collateral

for transactions under repo auctions, was revived

in November 2017.

A few issues were encountered in the process

of implementation of monetary policy during

the year 2017. The anomaly created in the call and

repo rates due to the notional tax credit applicable

to transactions involving government securities

continued to affect the interest rate structure in

the money market in 2017. However, with the

implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act, the

notional tax credit payable on interest income in

relation to secondary market transactions involving

government securities will no longer be applicable

from April 2018, thus resolving this issue.

With a view to encouraging price discovery

in the money market and promoting informed

decision making by market participants as

well as to improve market signalling of OMO,

measures were taken to make more information

on OMO available to the market, commencing

from August 2017. The Central Bank commenced

publishing cut-off rates of the OMO auctions to

signal the desired path for short-term interest rates.

Moreover, the overnight liquidity estimate was also

made available to the market, in the morning, on a

daily basis.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

Market liquidity: The Central Bank allowed greater

flexibility in the exchange rate during the year 2017.

Accordingly, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

against the US dollar by 2.00 per cent, from

Rs. 149.80 at end December 2016 to Rs. 152.85 at end

December 2017. Unwinding of the foreign investments

in government securities market with the expectations

of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve Bank

of New York, USA in March 2017 exerted pressure

on the Sri Lankan rupee to depreciate in early 2017.

The pressure was further surged due to debt service

payments and increased import demand during the

first quarter of 2017. With the conversions of exports

proceeds by exporters and the positive sentiments

created through the receipt of the third and fourth

tranches of the EFF from the IMF, the pressure on

the exchange rate eased gradually towards the end

of 2017. In-line with the overall depreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar, the average

US dollar buying and selling exchange rates of

commercial banks for telegraphic transfers as

of end 2017 were recorded at Rs. 151.31 and

Rs. 155.15, respectively, whilst comparative figures

as of end 2016 were Rs. 147.84 and Rs. 151.66,

respectively.

Government Securities Market

The upward adjustment in yield rates for

government securities continued until April

2017 in line with the increase in policy rates

by 25 basis points in March 2017. However, the

increasing trend moderated towards latter part of

the first half of 2017. The Treasury bill yield rates

adjusted downwards, in general, since May 2017.

The debt management strategies adopted during

the year in the form of maintaining a stable and

low interest rate environment especially during the

second half of the year was supported by positive

market momentum, created by the expectation

on accessing the international capital market,

successful buffer building exercises and improved

predictability and discipline in the new Treasury

bond auction system introduced during 2017.

The new system replaced the fully auction based

issuance system for Treasury bonds with the main

purpose of improving the efficiency of the process

of funding the Government at least possible cost

while maintaining transparency. The International

Sovereign Bonds were issued in May 2017

amounting to US dollars 1,500 million and buffer

funds were built through Treasury bond auctions

commencing from the second half of 2017. These

strategies helped ease the pressure on interest

rates in the domestic market. In addition, positive

adjustments in the sovereign ratings outlook during

the year and conducive investment landscape

contributed positively to increase foreign inflows

during the year, resulting in higher foreign holdings

of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds at the end

of 2017, compared to end 2016. As a result, the

Behaviour of the external value of the

Sri Lankan rupee against major currencies, with

reference to exchange rates and their volatility:

During the year, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

against other major currencies. The likelihood

of the European Central Bank reducing its asset

purchases and the interest rate hike by the Bank of

England, exerted pressure on the Sri Lankan rupee

to depreciate against the euro by 13.49 per cent

and pound sterling by 10.46 per cent during the

reference period. Owing to geopolitical uncertainty

and the general depreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee against the US dollar, the Sri Lankan rupee

was led to depreciate against the Japanese yen by

5.08 per cent and the Indian rupee by 7.54 per cent

during the year 2017.

During 2017 trading volumes in the domestic

foreign exchange market recorded a significant

increase of 11.4 per cent, compared to the

previous year. Transaction volumes of foreign

exchange in the domestic inter-bank market

increased to US dollars 16,451.1 million in 2017,

from US dollars 14,769.5 million in 2016. In

line with this, the daily average volumes in the

inter-bank foreign exchange market also increased

to US dollars 68 million in 2017, in comparison to

US dollars 61 million recorded in 2016.

The Central Bank continued to absorb foreign

exchange from the domestic inter-bank foreign

exchange market, thereby building up the

quantum of non-borrowed foreign exchange

reserves, while meeting the end December

net international reserve target under the

IMF-EFF program. During the year 2017, the Central

Bank absorbed US dollars 2,214.1 million from the

market and supplied US dollars 549.8 million to the

market, resulting in a net purchase of US dollars

1,664.4 million, thereby contributing to increase

the non-borrowed foreign exchange reserves of

the Central Bank.

benchmark yield rate of 364 day Treasury bills

recorded a decrease of 127 basis points by end

2017, compared to end 2016. The Treasury bill

rates for 91 day, 182 day and 364 day maturities

as at end December 2017 stood at 7.69 per cent,

8.30 per cent and 8.90 per cent, respectively. The

decline in short-term interest rates was reflected by

the decrease in Treasury bond yield rates during

the latter part of 2017.

Total net inflow of foreign investments in

Treasury bonds and Treasury bills amounted to

US dollars 440.6 million, which consisted of a

net inflow of US dollars 80.5 million in Treasury

bills and US dollars 360.1 million in Treasury

bonds during the year 2017. The outstanding

foreign holdings of Treasury bonds and Treasury

bills as at end 2017 amounted to Rs. 322.6 billion,

compared to Rs. 260.0 billion as at end 2016,

recording a substantial increase of 24.1 per cent

on a year-on-year basis.

The Public Debt Department raised US

dollars 2,231.4 million by issuing Sri Lanka

Development Bonds (SLDBs) during 2017

against the maturing amount of US dollars

1,878.0 million, in order to gain advantage of

the market conditions. This eased the pressure

on domestic rupee market financing and enabled to

maintain orderly domestic interest rates.

During 2017, the Average Time to Maturity

(ATM) of the overall domestic public debt

portfolio reduced and recorded 5.78 years by

end 2017, compared to 5.98 years at end 2016.

The ATM of outstanding Treasury bond portfolio at

end 2017 decreased to 6.72 years, from 7.07 years

at end 2016. The downward adjustment in ATM is

partly attributed to comparatively higher interest

rates and substantially higher volume of financing

that prevailed in the early part of 2017.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

Activity level of the market for Commercial

Papers (CPs) was relatively low in 2017 when

compared to the previous year. During 2017,

Rs. 6.5 billion worth CPs were issued with

the support of licensed banks, a slight decline

compared to Rs. 7.0 billion in 2016. Interest rates

pertaining to CPs varied between 13.75 per cent and

16.50 per cent during the year, whilst interest

rates varied between a range of 8.70 per cent and

14.80 per cent in 2016. The CPs issued during

the year were with shorter maturities. CPs with

maturities up to 3 months accounted for 95.9 per

cent of total issues during the year, whilst the

remaining 4.1 per cent consisted of CPs with a

6-month maturity. The total outstanding value

of CPs was low at Rs. 1.7 billion at end 2017,

compared to Rs. 2.2 billion at end 2016.

Activities in the corporate bond market was

limited, reflecting a low issuer and investor

base. As per the Colombo Stock Exchange

by 5.1 per cent, 8.8 per cent and 8.0 per cent,

respectively, while hotels & travel and manufacturing

sectors declined by 6.8 per cent and 9.1 per cent,

respectively. The plantations sector showed a

significant increase of 51.7 per cent amongst

small sectors. Moreover, the five largest and ten

largest companies accounted for 27.4 per cent and

42.1 per cent, respectively, of market capitalisation.

CSE remained small in terms of scale,

compared with its peers in the Asian region,

having only 296 listed companies and market

capitalisation of US dollars 18,959.5 billion

at end 2017. Market capitalisation, however,

increased by 5.6 per cent (Rs. 154 billion) in 2017,

compared to the decline of 6.6 per cent (or Rs. 193

billion) exhibited in 2016. The market price earnings

(PE) ratio showed relatively lower value of 10.6 by

end December 2017, compared to 12.4 recorded

at end December 2016. During the year, the ratio

reached its highest value of 12.9 in April 2017 and

declined to its lowest of 10.4 in August 2017. There

was only one IPO of shares in CSE in 2017, which

raised Rs. 14.1 billion, while one offer for sale was

recorded during the year. Further, Rs. 51.5 billon

was raised through 19 rights issues.

In the secondary market, the foreign

investments at CSE, on a net basis, improved

significantly to Rs. 17.7 billion in 2017, from

Rs. 383.5 million in 2016. This was partly due to

the availability of fundamentally strong stocks at low

prices. Foreign companies dominated the foreign

participation, accounting for 97.7 per cent of the

total foreign purchases, while foreign individuals

accounted only for 2.3 per cent. Foreign investor

contribution to total market turnover improved

marginally to 46.9 per cent in 2017, compared to

42.0 per cent during 2016.

During 2017, a number of regulatory

measures were taken and proposed by the

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

to develop market infrastructure to increase

market confidence. The SEC introduced a

Minimum Capital Adequacy Requirement for stock

brokers in March 2017 which intends to expand to

other players. Among the major proposed measures

for market infrastructure, SEC intends to introduce a

Delivery versus Payment (DvP) system and Central

Counterparty (CCP) clearing. In addition, CSE is in

the process of finalising Multicurrency Board, which

facilitates any company listed in another country to

come for a secondary listing in CSE. Furthermore,

introducing short selling, demutualisation of CSE

and enhancing the regulatory framework in line

with international standards are several expected

developments.

8.5 Development Finance and Access to Finance

Development finance and access to finance

have been identified as predominant factors

required for achieving balanced and inclusive

economic growth and combatting poverty in

an effective manner. In the context of Sri Lanka,

several governmental and non-governmental

institutions including the Central Bank implement

various lending programmes to promote

development finance and access to finance

islandwide. These programmes focused not only

on providing concessionary finance but also on

providing credit supplementary facilities to the less

privileged sectors of the society.

During 2017, the Central Bank implemented

15 refinance and interest subsidy schemes

through the Regional Development Department

and provided concessionary credit facilities

amounting to Rs. 19,251.0 million to 126,742

beneficiaries islandwide. These schemes were

funded by the Central Bank, Government of Sri

Lanka (GOSL), donor agencies and Participating

Financial Institutions (PFIs).

Shouldering the national responsibility

of supporting disaster affected economic

activities to resume operations, the Central

Bank implemented two refinance loan schemes

namely, “Athwela” loan scheme and the

"Post-disaster Economic Activity Recovery"

Loan (PEARL) Scheme, which is under the

National Agri-business Development Project.

These schemes were funded by the GOSL and the

International Fund for Agricultural Development

(IFAD), respectively. A new loan scheme in the

name of “Swashakthi – Towards One Million Jobs”

loan scheme, was introduced in 2017 with the

collaboration of the Ministry of National Policies

and Economic Affairs (MNPEA), identifying the

importance of the presence of a Government-led

support mechanism to address financial, technical,

marketing and entrepreneurship needs of new and

existing entrepreneurs of the country. The loan

scheme mainly serves youth and young graduates,

women and differently abled people. The ultimate

objective of the “Swashakthi” loan scheme is to

contribute to the Government's broader policy

objective of generating one million jobs over the

next five-year period.

In 2017, the Central Bank acted as a

main stakeholder of the Agriculture Sector

Modernisation Project (AMP) of Sri Lanka which

was funded by the International Development

Association (IDA). The AMP is being implemented

by the Ministry of Primary Industries and the

Ministry of Agriculture. The two implementing

agencies operate AMP with the objective of

supporting enhanced agriculture productivity,

increasing efficiency, improving market access,

and enhancing value addition by all stakeholders

in the agricultural production process. The Central

Project Coordination Committee established under

the MNPEA is expected to provide overall policy

oversight, guidance and project monitoring for

the AMP. Under the AMP, the Central Bank has

established the Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG)

scheme in 2017. This scheme is expected to

operate as an innovative risk sharing tool that will

address the current and changing needs of financial

intermediaries, while supporting the development

objective of the AMP. The PCG scheme will also

address the issue of collateral requirements of the

PFIs in the process of funding farmers.

Continuing its battle against financial

exclusion in the country, the Central

Bank carried out 150 financial literacy,

entrepreneurship development and skills

development programmes during 2017 with

special focus on those who have no access

to the formal financial sector due to various

reasons. These programmes were designed to

create awareness among the general public, mainly

on the drawbacks of financial exclusion and the

benefits of linking with the formal financial sector.

These programmes also acted as knowledge

sharing forums on good banking and financial

habits, financial discipline and new financial

instruments and services available in the formal

sector. During the year, the Central Bank was able

to utilise print and electronic media effectively, in

creating awareness among the general public.

Showing the continued efforts of the GOSL

in development finance and in increasing

access to finance, the Ministry of Finance and

Mass Media (MOFMM) initiated the following

08 concessionary interest subsidy schemes

in March 2017, with the intention of generating

50,000 new job opportunities in the country.

1. “Ran Aswenna” loan scheme

2. “Govi Navoda” loan scheme

3. “Diri Saviya” loan scheme

4. “Jaya Isura” loan scheme

5. “Rivi Bala Savi” loan scheme

6. “Soduru Piyasa” loan scheme

7. “Riya Shakthi” loan scheme

8. “Madya Aruna” loan scheme

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

2828

These interest subsidy schemes were

implemented in line with the “Enterprise Sri Lanka”

programme of the GOSL, which intends to make

all Sri Lankans stakeholders in a production

economy, achieving the medium-term objectives

of the GOSL; achieving a per capita income up

to US dollars 5,000, creating one million new

employment opportunities, doubling exports and

sustaining economic growth at over 5 per cent by

the year 2020.

The main objective of the “Ran Aswenna”

scheme is to enhance productivity in the

agriculture sector through facilitating

commercialised agriculture. The “Govi Navoda”

loan scheme intends to financially empower the

small-scale farmers, enabling them to increase

harvest and minimise the production cost. On the

other hand, the “Diri Saviya” scheme provides

concessionary credit facilities to self-employed

individuals to obtain deep freezers, with the

intention of uplifting the distribution of qualitative

poultry products.

The “Riya Shakthi” scheme has been

introduced by the MOFMM to provide safer

school transport service to school children by

establishing a more effective school transport

service in the country. Meanwhile, “Jaya Isura”

scheme was implemented to provide loans to the

small and medium scale enterprises in various other

sectors including agriculture, fisheries, livestock,

floriculture, horticulture, light engineering, printing,

tourism, handicrafts, garments, information

technology and production industry sectors.

In addition, the “Rivi Bala Savi” scheme

introduced by the MOFMM will enable the

house owners to generate electricity for their

own usage at a lower cost, while enabling

them to supply their excess production to the

national electricity grid. While the “Rivi Bala

Savi” scheme will benefit the house owners, the

newly introduced “Soduru Piyasa” scheme will

enable individuals who have already embarked on

building their houses but need financial assistance,

to complete their houses. In contrast, the

“Madya Aruna” loan scheme is designed to facilitate

registered journalists and media personnel for the

modification of their media equipment to carry out

their duties without any hindrance.

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce

also continued to serve new and existing

entrepreneurs in the country through the Small

and Micro Industry Leader and Entrepreneur

Promotion Project Phase III– Revolving Fund

(SMILE III - RF), which consists of two main

loan schemes, namely "General Loan Scheme"

and the "Technical Transfer Assistance Loan

Scheme." These schemes provide concessionary

funding for the micro or small-scale manufacturing

or industrial enterprises.

During 2017, apart from the above

organisations that implemented refinance

and interest subsidy loan schemes, several

other governmental and non-governmental

institutions too carried out operations with

a view to enhance development finance and

access to finance in the country. These efforts,

irrespective of their scale, present a fragmented

approach towards increasing access to finance in

Sri Lanka. Hence, identifying the need for a national

level holistic approach in this regard, the Central

Bank initiated action to develop a comprehensive

National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) in

2017. Accordingly, in January 2018, the Central

Bank signed an Agreement of Co-operation with

the International Financial Corporation (IFC),

a member of the World Bank Group, to obtain

technical assistance to develop the NFIS. Having

an NFIS could be identified as an important step

towards standardised approach for the use of all

stakeholders to operate in one direction to improve

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

283

8

the financial inclusiveness of the country. The NFIS

can serve to deepen and accelerate national efforts

to reach higher levels of financial inclusion in the

future.

The economic impact expected by the

implementation of the NFIS is diverse. In the short

run, it will expand the retail payments infrastructure

and foster easier access to and greater use of

electronic transaction instruments, encouraging the

use of a diverse set of financial services. It will also

create an enabling environment for the provision

of affordable financial services, while ensuring that

all consumers of financial services are adequately

educated, protected, informed, and fairly treated

and their conflicts are resolved in a cost- effective

and efficient manner. In the medium to long term, it

is expected to achieve a comprehensively inclusive

financial system that includes each and every

adult and enterprise in the country. This inclusive

financial system would allow its participants to

make full use of a range of adequate, quality, and

affordable financial services without any hassle or

interruption.

8.6 Financial Infrastructure

Payment & Settlement Systems

The payment and settlement infrastructure

continued to cater for the payment needs of

individuals and institutions, while focusing

on enhancing the efficiency, convenience

and safety of payments, in order to effectively

facilitate the economic activities of the country.

The Central Bank, being guided by the vision

of moving towards a less cash society, initiated

policies to promote electronic payment mechanisms

while ensuring security of such mechanisms. As

the regulator of the national payment system, the

Central Bank further broadened the regulatory and

supervisory activities with the objective of ensuring

the stability and soundness of the financial system

by effectively mitigating the risks associated with

payment and settlement systems.

The large value payment system and the

retail payment systems functioned smoothly

in 2017, facilitating increasing volumes of

payment transactions. The two subsystems of the

LankaSettle System, namely the Real Time Gross

Settlement (RTGS) System and the LankaSecure

System, continued to facilitate large value and time

critical fund transfers and government securities

transactions respectively, by providing the

electronic payment and settlement infrastructure

for effecting such transactions. During the period

under review, 377,312 transactions with a value of

Rs. 92,303 billion were effected through the RTGS

System. In comparison to the previous year, the

RTGS transaction volume registered a growth of

3.1 per cent, while the aggregate value of RTGS

transactions declined marginally by 1.2 per cent

in 2017. The RTGS system continued to be the

largest contributor for non-cash payments in terms

of aggregate transaction value in 2017, and the

aggregate value of RTGS transactions accounted

for 86.3 per cent of the aggregate value of

non-cash payments in the country. The Central

Bank, as the operator of the RTGS System,

continued to extend the interest free Intra-day

Liquidity Facility (ILF) to participating institutions

of the system, against the collateral of government

securities, to support RTGS participants to meet

their liquidity requirements, and by that means

reduce the liquidity risk of the RTGS System. In

2017, the daily average value of ILF utilised by

RTGS participants was recorded as Rs. 47.4 billion.

At end 2017, total value of scripless securities

held in LankaSecure amounted to Rs. 4,912.2

billion (face value), consisting of Treasury

bills of Rs. 724.7 billion and Treasury bonds of

Rs. 4,187.5 billion.

The Cheque Clearing System of the country

operated by LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd. (LCPL)

functioned smoothly during the year under

review and the aggregate volume of cheques

cleared through the Cheque Clearing System

accounted for 24.3 per cent of the total volume

of non-cash payments of the country during

2017. When compared with 2016, the total volume

of cheques cleared through the Cheque Clearing

System recorded a negative growth of 0.1 per cent

while the aggregate value of cheques cleared grew

by 9.2 per cent in 2017.

During the year under review, the Sri Lanka

Inter-bank Payment System (SLIPS), which

facilitates retail inter-bank payments, continued

the growing trend in its operations with both

the volume and value of payments processed

through the system increasing over the

previous year. The aggregate volume and value

of the payments effected through SLIPS grew by

12.7 per cent to 30 million and by 18.4 per cent

to Rs. 1,725 billion, respectively. In September

2017, the number of clearing cycles of SLIPS per

business day was increased from two to three, in

order to enable faster processing and settlement of

SLIPS transactions.

The Common Card and Payment Switch

(CCAPS), which functions under the brand

name “LankaPay” further expanded its

operations, recording a noteworthy progress

in 2017, with the three sub-switches launched

so far, namely the Common ATM Switch (CAS),

Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch

(CEFTS) and Shared ATM Switch (SAS). The

CAS provides interconnectivity among the ATMs

of member financial institutions, thereby enabling

customers of such financial institutions to perform

cash withdrawals and balance inquiries from any

ATM connected to the CAS network. In 2017,

the ATM transaction volume and value of CAS

increased by 44.4 per cent to 32.9 million and

52.6 per cent to Rs. 264.1 billion respectively, in

comparison to the previous year. At the end of

the review period, the total number of financial

institutions connected to the CAS network was

recorded as 27, while all licensed banks operating

their own ATM switches completed the integration

with CAS. The Central Bank encouraged CAS

members to adopt EMV technology and decided

on 01 January 2018 as the liability shift date for

EMV migration in CAS. EMV, which stands for

EuroPay, MasterCard and Visa, is an international

standard for enhancing security of card payments

by authenticating transactions using chip card

technology. CAS member institutions that have not

enabled EMV by the liability shift date will be more

probable to assume fraud liability, as the liability

will shift to the member institutions which have

not adopted EMV technology. SAS, which was

launched in 2015 to provide card management

and ATM transaction routing services to financial

institutions that do not have the capacity to operate

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

285

8

their own card management system and ATM

switch for routing ATM transactions, continued its

operations smoothly during the review period.

CEFTS, the second phase of CCAPS was

launched in 2015 to facilitate retail fund

transfers among member institutions on a real

time basis. The noteworthy progress recorded

in CEFTS during the review period was reflected

by the CEFTS transaction growth both in volume

and value terms. In comparison to the previous

year the CEFTS transaction volume increased

remarkably by 253.6 per cent to 3.2 million while

the CEFTS transaction value grew by 294.5 per

cent to Rs. 273.7 billion in 2017. Further, the

Central Bank granted approval to implement

several developments in CEFTS in order to better

facilitate fund transfer requirements in the country.

Accordingly, LankaClear Private Ltd. (LCPL) was

authorised to implement the LankaPay Online

Payment Platform (LPOPP) linked to CEFTS

to provide the facility to execute online real time

payments to Government institutions. LPOPP was

launched in July 2017 to initially facilitate real time

payments to Sri Lanka Customs and the platform

will be extended to other government institutions in

the future. LPOPP will contribute to streamline the

government revenue collection procedures as well

as offer convenience benefits to individuals and

institutions in making payments to Government

institutions. Further, LPOPP has the capability to

facilitate payments to any other institution, enabling

such institutions to reap the benefits of LPOPP. As

at end 2017, seven licensed commercial banks

had joined LPOPP and during the few months in

operation, 1,276 transactions with an aggregate

value of Rs. 514 million were processed through

LPOPP. Considering the average per transaction

values of tariff payments made to Sri Lanka

Customs, the Payment and Settlement Systems

Circular No. 01 of 2015 was replaced by issuing

Payment and Settlement Circular No. 08 of 2017

to increase the maximum per transaction value

limit for transactions carried out through a specific

transaction code assigned to LPOPP, in order to

prevent disruptions to the operations of LPOPP due

to the maximum transaction value limit imposed

for CEFTS transactions. In addition, the Central

Bank granted approval to introduce the concept for

Payment Exchange Name for CEFTS transactions,

where the payee’s mobile number and a nickname

assigned for the account will be used for fund

transfers instead of the account number. The

Payment Exchange Name concept is intended to

further enhance customer convenience and more

importantly reduce CEFTS transaction rejections

due to incorrect entry of account numbers.

With a view to reducing costs incurred

by cardholders and merchants on domestic

payment card transactions, the Central Bank

granted approval to LCPL to implement a

National Card Scheme (NCS). The NCS will be

launched in partnership with an international card

scheme providing worldwide acceptance for cards

issued under NCS. LCPL plans to commence

issuing cards under NCS in 2018. Further, as

the fourth phase of CCAPS, LCPL will implement

the Common Point-of-Sale Switch in line with

NCS to provide clearing facilities for point-of-sale

transactions executed using cards issued under

NCS.

The Central Bank, as the regulator of

payment and settlement systems of the country,

continued to further strengthen the regulatory

framework and the supervisory practices in

order to minimise the risks in the national

payment and settlement system. In 2017, an

LCB and an LFC, which were licensed in terms of

the Payment Cards and Mobile Payment Systems

Regulations No. 1 of 2013 were granted approval

to operate a Customer Account based Mobile

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2017

2868

Payment System and to function as an Issuer of

Credit Cards, respectively. In addition, taking the

payment system developments into consideration,

the Central Bank intends to revise the credit

card operational guidelines and to broaden the

regulatory framework by issuing regulations on

acquiring payment card based electronic commerce

transactions through service providers and on

payment related mobile applications. On the other

hand the Central Bank, in performing the role of

the catalyst of payment and settlement systems,

continued policy formulation measures to support

the digitalisation move in the national payment and

settlement system. Considering the developments

in the payments landscape, the National Payments

Council, the consultative committee on payment

and settlement systems, appointed two committees

to study developments in the financial technology

(FinTech) sector and Blockchain technology.

Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017

In line with the Government Policy, a new

legislative and policy framework for foreign

exchange operations was implemented by

repealing the Exchange Control Act, No. 24 of

1953 and introducing the new Foreign Exchange

Act, No. 12 of 2017, with effect from 20 November

2017. The Department of Foreign Exchange

was established in place of the Exchange Control

Department, to implement provisions of the new Act.

New regulations were implemented with

a view to further liberalise capital flows and

simplify the processes associated with foreign

exchange transactions through relaxing

regulations and restrictions. The new foreign

exchange regime would be more facilitative in

the conduct of foreign exchange transactions.

Therefore, it is expected that these regulations

would meet expectations of the stakeholders and

potential investors.

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism

The legal framework and measures relating

to mitigating Money Laundering and Terrorist

Financing (ML/TF) in the country is vital for the

stability of the financial system. The Financial

Intelligence Unit (FIU) of Sri Lanka continued its

operations during 2017 in terms of the statutory

provisions of the Financial Transactions Reporting

Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA). The main functions

carried out were collection of data relating to

suspicious financial transactions to facilitate the

prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution

of the offences relating to ML/TF and issue rules to

financial institutions and non-financial institutions

to undertake due diligence measures to combat

money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

Receipt, Analysis and Dissemination of Information

Reporting institutions, namely LCBs, LSBs,

LFCs, Stock Brokering Firms (SBs), Insurance

Companies (ICs) and Authorised Money

Changing Companies (AMCCs), continued

to report Cash Transactions (CTRs) and

Electronic Fund Transfers (EFTs-inward and

outwards) subject to the specified reporting

threshold of Rs. 1.0 million or its equivalent in

foreign currencies as per the Section 6 of the

FTRA. During the period, reporting institutions have

reported 4.5 million CTRs and 4.3 million EFTs.

In addition, Suspicious Transactions

Reports (STRs) on any transaction or attempted

transactions which may be related to the

commission of any unlawful activity were filed

with the FIU by the above Reporting Institutions

in terms of Section 7 of the FTRA. The FIU

received 925 STRs from reporting institutions, law

enforcement agencies and general public and after

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

analysis and assessment a total of 418 STRs were

referred to the law enforcement and regulatory

authorities for further investigations during the

period.

Compliance Monitoring

Twenty one risk based on-site examinations

were conducted during the period to monitor

the financial institutions' compliance with the

FTRA and rules issued thereunder.

Signing of Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)

Five MOUs were signed with the Anti-Money

Laundering Office (AMLO) of the Kingdom of

Thailand, The FIU of the Kingdom of Bhutan,

China AML Monitoring and Analysis, Qatar

Financial Information Unit Center, and FIU of

Trinidad and Tobago during the period, to share

financial information in facilitating investigation

and prosecution of persons suspected of being

involved in ML/TF, increasing the total number

of MOUs signed with foreign counterparts up to

37. Two MOUs with the Department for Registration

of Persons and Sri Lanka Police were signed to

facilitate the FIU analysis function, increasing

the total number of MOUs signed with domestic

agencies up to five.

Listing by Financial Action Task Force and Measures Initiated to Improve Compliance

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the

global policy setter for Anti-Money Laundering

and Countering the Financing of Terrorism

(AML/CFT), evaluates legal, institutional

framework and effective implementation of

AML/CFT measures of countries regularly

through regional monitoring bodies. Sri Lanka

was subjected to its second Mutual Evaluation

(ME) by APG during 2014/15. The 2nd Mutual

Evaluation Report (MER) on Sri Lanka that was

adopted in July, 2015, recommended Sri Lanka to

initiate a number of actions to rectify the AML/CFT

deficiencies identified during the ME. FATF at its

Plenary held at Buenos Aires, Argentina in October

2017, listed Sri Lanka as a jurisdiction with strategic

AML/CFT deficiencies in the FATF’s Compliance

Document, which is more commonly identified as

the “Grey List”. Upon listing, a time bound action

plan to address the strategic deficiencies identified

was provided to Sri Lanka and the Central Bank

together with other relevant stakeholders have

already taken necessary initiatives towards the

successful completion of the said action plan within

the given time frame for Sri Lanka to improve

compliance and country rating.

Legislative Developments

The Suspicious Transactions (Format)

Regulation of 2017 was issued on 21 April

2017 by way of Gazette Extraordinary 2015/56,

applicable for all institutions.

Credit Information

The Credit Information Bureau (CRIB)

provides credit information reports on

borrowers to member institutions. During the

year 2017, the CRIB issued 9,096,132 credit

reports, compared with 7,948,967 reports in 2016,

which is a 14.4 per cent growth. This growth is

mainly attributable to the expanding credit related

activities in the economy. The CRIB had a total of

85 reporting credit institutions as its members at

end 2017.

Several measures are being taken to expand

the services and improve the coverage of CRIB.

The CRIB intends to introduce a new bureau

system in the short term, which is expected to

deliver a credit score to both individuals and

business entities. Through this new bureau system,
